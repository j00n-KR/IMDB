0,TheLittleSongbird,"Funny, smart and always engaging fantasy adventure, with a marvellous cast",9,12 July 2010,"As a director, Terry Gilliam is a very unpredictable and inventive director, and Time Bandits is no exception. The film may be a tad too long perhaps, but Time Bandits does move briskly and overall is a hugely enjoyable fantasy adventure with a huge amount to like about it. It does have a brilliant concept, and the story is always engaging with a rare dull moment. The sets and costumes are wonderfully imaginative, the cinematography is beautiful and the special effects were surprisingly very good. The script is deliciously witty and smart, and the direction is unpredictable pretty much.The film is filled with astonishing sequences particularly the climax and likable characters, as well as a fun and wondrous soundtrack. On top of all the things that made Time Bandits work so well, the cast is marvellous, Michael Palin, Craig Warnock, Shelley Duvall and Katherine Helmond are all entertaining and appealing, David Warner was great as the Evil Genius and the Time Bandits are a sheer delight, but the four standouts were John Cleese who was hilarious as Robin Hood, Ian Holm who made for a superb Napolean, Sean Connery who was suitably imposing and charismatic and I loved the eccentricity that Ralph Richardson gave to the Supreme Being.Overall, hugely enjoyable and in my opinion a must watch for fans of the genre. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Time Bandits
1,bkoganbing,Time Traveling Munchkins,7,19 September 2010,"The Monty Python troupe in creating Time Bandits invaded territory reserved in this day and age for Stephen Spielberg. A touch of Spielberg here would have made this film a classic which I believe it falls short of.Imagine the Wizard Of Oz combined with the television series Voyagers and you have Time Bandits. With the munchkins as the protagonists.Playing the Dorothy role is young Craig Warnock who is an appealing lad. He's a bright kid with a vivid imagination who is neglected by his parents. But one night as he's ready to go to sleep these little people crash right through his bedroom wall on a quest for the richest treasures on the earth. The munchkins have stolen a map from the Supreme Being and this allows them to time travel up and down through time and the young boy joins their caravan. Young Warnock like Meeno Peluce in Voyagers got to meet such interesting and varied folk as Agamemnon, Robin Hood, Napoleon, and even sail on the Titanic, mostly played by members of the Monty Python troupe. His best scenes however are with Sean Connery who plays Agamemnon and is ready to make Warnock the heir to Mycenae.Where there is a Supreme Being there is also a Devil and David Warner pulls out all the stops in playing him. If he hams it up a bit, remember that Time Bandits is a film seen through a child's eye and that's prone to exaggeration. Similarly the all wise Supreme Being is confidently played by Ralph Richardson.I've a feeling that when one of them got to play God, the other had to try. 1981 was also the year that Laurence Olivier played Zeus in Clash Of The Titans and depending on who heard who was playing what first, the other was probably spurred to try. I'll leave it to you to decide who was a better Supreme Being, Olivier or Richardson.The film is good, but falls short classic status. It's a Stephen Spielberg property that would have needed him to vault it into classic status.",Time Bandits
2,SnoopyStyle,Great Gilliam Imagination,7,5 December 2014,"A young boy Kevin's bedroom is invaded by unreal visions. One night, midgets come out of his wardrobe. They are on the run from the Supreme Being after stealing his map. It's a map to all the holes in the universe and they intend to use it to get stinkin' rich. They run into Napoleon (Ian Holm). Then they get captured by Robin Hood (John Cleese). The Great Evil (David Warner) is looking for the map after being trapped in the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness by the Supreme Being. Kevin gets separated and lands on Agamemnon (Sean Connery) battling the Minotaur.It's got great Terry Gilliam imagination behind this. It gets a bit random at times but it's always nice to have the Monty Python gang around. The only problem is the lack of compelling actors in the lead. The little actors and the kid can't pull focus. I really like Gilliam's imagination but the movie rambles from one crazy place to the next. Some of the places are not grand enough but one must remember that this is time before computers. The effects are mostly real or in miniatures.",Time Bandits
3,Prismark10,Time Bandits,9,9 December 2020,"Terry Gilliam moves a little a bit away from Monty Python with Time Bandits.It is a whimsical fantasy version of The Wizard of Oz with added British humour.Kevin is a young suburban boy whose bedroom is overrun by time travelling midgets. They are on the run from the Supreme Being with a stolen map that contains all the holes in the universe.They plan to use the holes as a gateway to various epochs of history and become rich by stealing.Young Kevin joins them and along the way they encounter and steal from Napoleon (Ian Holm.) Get robbed by Robin Hood (John Cleese.) Kevin meets the Greek King Agamemnon (Sean Connery) who is battling a minotaur and wants to stay with him.Tempting them to his lair is the Great Evil (David Warner) who is also after the map.This is an episodic adventure which is both zany surreal and imaginative.Gilliam takes a pop at the creeping influence of consumerism, modern technology and creepy American style game shows. Kevin's parents are into their kitchen gadgets as they watch a game show called Your Money or Your Life.Made in 1981 by Handmade Films. Gilliam has worked wonders with a low budget in what is a special effects heavy movie.Craig Warnock is very good as Kevin. The rest of the adult cast ham it up suitably. Holm as the height obsessed Napoleon. Cleese plays Robin Hood like he was the Queen.Sean Connery plays it almost straight. Warner really looks to be having a hoot. Ralph Richardson decided that the supreme being would look better with a good suit on. Look out for Jim Broadbent as the game show host.",Time Bandits
4,mark.waltz,"Time has been really good to ""Time Bandits"".",8,4 July 2020,"In a year of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Excalibur"" and ""Dragonslayer"", fantasy adventures were a popular escape, and ""Time Bandits"" has stood the test of time to become a memorable modern classic. Through the mind's eye of Terry Gilliam, an all-star cast joins some Monty Python regulars for a fight between good and evil, with Craig Warnock leading the cast as a young boy living through history and aiding a bunch of lovable little men prevent the devil (David Warner in a delightful villainous term, topping his part in ""Titanic"") from getting his hands on a valuable map stolen by the dwarfs from the supreme being (Ralph Richardson).Warner has a delightful moment that is timely nearly 40 years later as he discovers his delight in learning about computers and ""the microchip"", quite an irony. With the help of his new dwarf friends, Warnock gets to visit historical events through the times of Napoleon, King Agamemmnon, Robin Hood and the Titanic. The film doesn't go in any chronological order, so this is not a timely view of history, just a very entertaining one. Ian Holm as Napoleon is very funny, unable to clap because his hand is inside his shirt; Sean Connery as the brave and fatherly Agamemmnon, wanting to adopt young Kevin; and John Cleese is a droll Robin Hood. There's a recurring gag of Michael Palin and Shelley Duvall as star-crossed lovers throughout history being interrupted by the falling bodies of Kevin and the dwarves.Great special effects, terrific sets and plenty of action keeps this hopping with Richardson stealing his scene in the last moment with his warning of being careful of pieces of a dastardly character with the simple line, ""Be careful. That's concentrated evil!"" Richardson also gives a nice little reasoning as to why evil exists in the first place. This is a definite crowd pleaser that some may consider way ahead of its time simply because of how it holds up. But it is evidence that the films of the late 70's and early 80's (the beginning of the blockbuster period of films) were great influencers on the overly done special effects of today.",Time Bandits
5,gavin6942,A Terry Gilliam Fantasy,7,31 December 2014,"A young boy accidentally joins a band of dwarfs as they jump from era to era looking for treasure to steal.Upon my first viewing, I didn't much care for this film. Not sure why, but it definitely did not appeal to me. Even with all the Monty Python folks involved (including John Cleese as Robin Hood), I wasn't sold.On second viewing, I love it. The costumes, the characters... and with Blu-ray, the film looks better than ever before. There are some elements of fantasy similar to ""Legend"" or other films of the era, but executed better here and with that quirky sense that Gilliam had before he went mainstream.",Time Bandits
6,lee_eisenberg,time is on everyone's side here,10,12 May 2006,"In what I believe was Terry Gilliam's directorial debut, a young boy (Craig Warnock) travels through time with several dwarfs trying to escape an evil being (David Warner). Far out, you say? Well, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. And besides, Gilliam's movies aren't exactly mainstream - think ""Brazil"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". This one is all about the ""wow"" factor. Whether it's the encounters with Napoleon (Ian Holm), Robin Hood (John Cleese), King Agamemnon (Sean Connery), the Titanic, or the adventures in fantasy stories, ""Time Bandits"" has something for everyone. Also starring Shelley Duvall, Katherine Helmond, Michael Palin, Ralph Richardson, and even appearances by two people who would later become famous: Jim Broadbent and Warwick Davis (of the ""Leprechaun"" movies, the ""Harry Potter"" movies, and ""Ray"").",Time Bandits
7,jboothmillard,Time Bandits,6,17 January 2007,"I heard of this on a countdown programme and thought it was going to be quite good, and it almost was. I did trail off in a few moments, but it didn't ruin it. Directed by ex-Monty Python member Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Fisher King) this is quite a good family film. Basically schoolboy Kevin accompanies a group of time travelling outlaw dwarfs through many astonishing time sequences. There is a good bunch of (many British) stars including John Cleese as Robin Hood, Sir Sean Connery (and they didn't expect him to say yes) as King Agamemnon (also plays a Fireman when Kevin goes back home), Shelley Duvall as Dame Pansy/Pansy, Katherine Helmond as Mrs. Ogre, Sir Ian Holm as Napoleon, Michael Palin as Vincent, Ralph Richardson as Supreme Being, Peter Vaughan as Winston the Ogre, David Warner as Evil Genius and Jim Broadbent as Compere. The dwarfs are Randall (David Rappaport), Fidgit (Star Wars' R2-D2 Kenny Baker), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds), Wally (Jack Purvis) and Vermin (Tiny Ross). It was number 69 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!",Time Bandits
8,Woodyanders,Marvelously idiosyncratic and imaginative fantasy comedy adventure pip,9,21 March 2016,"Unhappy eleven-year-old boy Kevin (a fine and engaging performance by Craig Warnack) inadvertently joins up with a gang of mischievous dwarfs who possess a map that enables them to travel through time and happily plunder treasure from famous historical figures. Meanwhile, Evil (a splendidly sardonic portrayal by David Warner) plots to obtain the map so he can rule the universe.Director Terry Gilliam, who co-wrote the witty and creative script with Michael Palin, displays a tireless and positively infectious go-for-broke inventiveness that's quite a joy to behold from start to finish, keeps the wildly entertaining story moving along at a constant snappy pace, ably crafts and maintains a fairly dark, yet blithely irreverent tone, delivers an uproarious array of inspired wacky gags (for example, an ogre's ship turns out to be a hat on top of a giant's head), further provides wickedly spot-on satirical swipes at free will, mindless greed, technology run amok, shallow consumerism and materialism, and the necessity for evil to exist in the world, and tops everything off with a genuinely startling bleak ending.A slew of sharp cameos from a terrific assortment of big names qualifies as an additional delightful plus: Ian Holm as a neurotic and irritable Napoleon, Sean Connery as the kindly King Agamemnon, John Cleese as a cheerfully doltish and polite Robin Hood, a deliciously droll Ralph Richardson as the prim'n'proper Supreme Being, Peter Vaughan as an ogre with a bad back, Katherine Helmond as the ogre's doting wife, and Palin and Shelley Duvall as lovers both in the Middle Ages and on board the Titanic. Tiny Ross, Kenny Baker, Jack Purvis, Malcolm Dixon, Mike Edmonds, and especially David Rappaport as rascally leader Randall are all extremely personable as the dwarfs. A real treat.",Time Bandits
9,ma-cortes,Imaginative fantasy about time travels in which our heroes take on several adventures and dangers,7,11 January 2014,"This wonderful flick deal with a little boy (Craig Warnock won the role after a wide search for the right child actor) and six dwarfs (Kenny Baker , David Rappaport , Jack Purvis , among others) who are chased by the Supreme Being through time and space .

Along the way they meet historical characters such as Napoleon (49-year-old Ian Holm plays the 26-year-old Bonaparte) , Robin Hood (John Cleese , though Michael Palin wrote the role of Robin for himself, but Cleese wanted to play him), Supreme Being (Ralph Richardson) and King Agamemnon (the gold masks of Agamemnon's priests are replicas of a king's deathmask, found by Heinrich Schliemann at Mycenae in 1876 , it is in Museum of Atenas). At the end the motley group contends the Evil Genius (David Wagner , the apparatus on his head was influenced by H.R. Giger's work on Alien) .This is an imaginative , glamorous , chaotic fantasy based on the wonderful trips carried out by a group of adventurers along with a young English schoolboy . Fantastic film contains sense of adventure , thrills , and lots of imagination . From start to finish fantasy , action and delightful adventure are continued . Exciting and interesting screenplay written by Michael Palin and and Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame .

Starring a considerable cast of top-names performers such as John Cleese as Robin Hood , Shelley Duvall as Dame , Ian Holm as Napoleon , Michael Palin as Vincent , Ralph Richardson as Supreme Being and David Warner as Evil and a young Jim Broadbent as a TV host . Special mention to Sean Connery as King Agamemnon and Fireman , Gilliam did not originally intend to cast Sean Connery as King Agamemnon , he merely wrote in the screenplay that when Agamemnon took off his helmet that he looked ""exactly like Sean Connery."" To Gilliam's surprise, the script found its way into Connery's hands and Connery subsequently expressed interest in doing the film.This big-budgeted , under-appreciated film achieved a limited hit at box office and panned by some critics ; however , today is very well considered . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Peter Biziou . Thrilling as well as evocative original music by Mike Moran . The motion picture was imaginatively directed by Terry Gilliam . Terry shot the film in low camera angles throughout in order to give the audience the perspective of a dwarf or a child . Gilliam is an expert on wonderful , surreal atmospheres (Adventures of Baron Munchausen , Brazil , Fisher king , Doctor Parnasus). He is member of the comedy group ""Monty Python"" along with John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. ¨Time bandits¨ might be described as an extraordinary fantasy full of imagination and color . It's a tale for teens and adults in which entertainment and amusement are guaranteed . Rating : Good , better than average . Worthwhile watching .",Time Bandits
10,Quinoa1984,"I wonder if I would've liked this more, or less, as a child...",8,4 September 2005,"After submerging myself finally into Time Bandits, perhaps too late (or too soon, if I had kids maybe it would've been a different experience), I found it reminded me of a live-action version of one of these animated adventures I would watch on TV as a kid, where a child would be brought into a fantastical universe away from his dull, ordinary existence, with strange friends/characters, and then go on adventures. In a couple of small ways its even palatable to the Terry Jones/Jim Henson collaboration Labyrinth. But the difference here is that it is fused with some more mature humor and some darker elements. In a way this is what the college-age fans of Monty Python in the 70's must have seen as the perfect film to take their kids to see in the 80's. Terry Gilliam, co-writer/director (co-written with fellow Python Michael Palin), knows how to entertain, and many sequences are terrific. It's a shame that some of them were not as much, and a little spotty. The sheer zaniness though, and the will for Gilliam to keep throwing visual gags and intense, fun imagery, keeps it never boring.It's without a doubt that Time Bandits is in a sense a more 'mainstream' (err, accessible) picture than many of Gilliam's other works, mostly because it tries to reach into the imagination in all people, young and old. Kevin (Craig Warnock, a good straight-character for the audience amid all the ruckus), is in a land of his own imagination, until a group of pillaging dwarfs (played by the likes of David Rappaport and Kenny 'R2-D2- Baker) traveling through time with a stolen map with gaps through time provided by a crazed 'supreme being'. They visit Napoleon (Ian Holm, an ingenious role), Robin Hood (John Cleese), and by accident King Agamemnon (Sean Connery, an unexpectedly cool role). But when the Evil Genius (David Warner, one of the funniest performances of the film) knows they have it, he'll do anything to lure them in to get it from them.This leads to a climax that in a darker, more scrambled way, reminded me of the climax of Blazing Saddles. There, like in this film, the story almost runs off the tracks, as many parts of history come into play with the forces of good versus evil. It does come to a satisfying conclusion, but in a small way is almost too much. Pauline Kael's comment that ""the film suffers from a surfeit of good ideas"" is not without some truth. There are so many jokes, so much imagination, so much creativity, its like a tipping scale that balances back and forth, rarely in the middle, of how affecting it is. For children, therefore, it is a sure bet, because children (for all of the modern corporate grabbing and testing of material) thrive on material like this, where the appearance of a comedian like Michael Palin in two separate, hilarious roles, doesn't matter as much as the sheer one-of-a-kind nature of everything put together. Some of the film is violent (as when the Evil Genius blows things up randomly), but always like a cartoon; one can sense the animation influence in the style's bones.And that is what separates this film from the other films and shows I saw as a child, that there is this need on the part of the filmmaker not to stick to anything really expected, while still in a 'once upon a time' framework. Some jokes may not be funny to kids until they get older, but images like the giant trudging slowly through the water, the dwarfs in a peril in the cages, the pageantry of the Greek sequences. It's all delightful, but also a little overwhelming, and of course a bit much on the first go-around.",Time Bandits
11,Hey_Sweden,A magical adventure.,8,25 November 2012,"Terry Gilliam is one of those filmmakers who can truly be labelled a visionary. This elaborate fantasy does have a real appeal and can be enjoyed by most members of the family, never getting too scary or traumatic for the younger viewers. It shows some real imagination, and has abundant humour as well as a sense of wonder.Young Craig Warnock stars as Kevin, a bright boy who is visited by six larcenous dwarfs that are travelling through time, all the while pursued by none other than The Supreme Being, and watched by the appropriately dubbed Evil Genius (David Warner). As part of the hook of this storyline, Kevin and the dwarfs encounter various historical figures such as Napoleon (Ian Holm), Robin Hood (John Cleese), and King Agamemnon (Sean Connery), while also ending up on the Titanic at one point.As Kevins' diminutive new friends, David Rappaport, Kenny Baker, Malcolm Dixon, Mike Edmonds, Jack Purvis, and Tiny Ross prove to be very engaging characters, and the all-star cast is a lot of fun to watch, even if some of the appearances are fairly brief. Holm is an ill-tempered Napoleon, Cleese a rather goofy Robin Hood, and Connery a warm and welcoming King. Michael Palin (with whom Gilliam wrote the screenplay) and Shelley Duvall pop up more than once, Katherine Helmond and Peter Vaughan are a delight as the seagoing ogre and his wife, and the always excellent Ralph Richardson is nicely cast as The Supreme Being. Be sure to look for Jim Broadbent and Derrick O'Connor in small roles.Now, the movie does go on for quite a bit, dragging at times, but it's still got enough spectacle, atmosphere, special effects, laughs - some of them in the Monty Python tradition - and social commentary on such subjects as materialism to keep it highly watchable. Gilliam doesn't turn the main character into a hero, but merely an observer and only sometime participant in the action; he's just one of the gang, basically. He also stays true to the dark nature of many a fairy tale, going with the kind of bleak ending we don't always see in this kind of thing.It's directors of his ilk who provide a very diverting and refreshing alternative to most mainstream cinema; now this viewer really must see the film that some fans regard as his masterpiece, 1985's ""Brazil"".Eight out of 10.",Time Bandits
12,grantss,"Okay, but not great",6,4 April 2016,"OK, but not great. Plot is random. At first, this is good and provides several funny moments and pleasant turns. After a while though, it becomes chaotic, and the random turns seem like a desperate way to keep the movie going and pad out time. Reasonably fun though - kids will probably enjoy it. Also very funny at times and has some great Pythonesque moments (quite appropriate, for a movie written by Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin, directed by Gilliam, and starring Palin and John Cleese).Ultimately a bit disappointing as it had quite a lot of potential and started so well.",Time Bandits
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Magic,7,5 January 2010,"Gilliam's films are not for everyone. He makes a unique brand of surreal pictures, where he lets his considerable imagination run wild. In them, literally anything can... and often does... happen. You can recognize his style once you've seen at least one of them(which is not at all to say that they aren't all worth a chance, because every single one of them that I've seen has been), and you can thus relatively quickly tell if you like his approach to fiction or not. He is not mainstream, and not for everyone. This has a young boy joining a band of midgets, and they go through different parts of history... to steal valuables. You never know what to expect to happen in this, and this pulls the rug out from under you so many times that you almost... but not quite... get used to it. Honestly, some of the time, you don't *know* what is going on, either... then again, I believe that this was the intent. The surrealism knows no bounds. This has fantastic creatures, locations and internal logic. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is absurdity through the entirety of this... including in the comedy, and it is hilarious at its best. A few of the jokes and gags do fall flat. This has tons of effects, and they are all fairly well-done(if maybe on a budget) for the period. To be objective, one negative about this is that, for the large cast, this does not hold an awful lot of characters that you can relate to. If one wanted to be harsh, one could suggest that Terry has the leads mainly to lead them through the situations where they visit odd places and meet bizarre... ""people""; to connect the scenes in this. In that regard, this is not his best. There is disturbing content(the amount will vary based upon the individual viewer) and a little mild to moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan of the director. 7/10",Time Bandits
14,view_and_review,God's Goofs,2,3 July 2019,"As a religious person who believes in God I'm not too keen on movies that essentially make fun of, or criticize God. That was an important thread to the overall story of this movie.When I was a child I thought the movie was just about time travel. Well, it is about time travel but the time travel is based upon God's poor craftsmanship.The time bandits are six dwarfs that are supposed to be the Supreme Being's employees. They drum up more thoughts of Santa's elves than divine helpers. In their greed they stole a map of the universe which has the location of these various holes. These holes were the Creator's lapses when creating the world. These holes were time warps that allowed the time bandits to leap from one era to another in search of riches. They were basically disgruntled employees that were now going to steal what they felt they earned anyway.You can imagine how valuable this map must be. Because of that, the Evil One also wanted this map. So between the dwarf gang and the Evil One there was no shortage of insults hurled in God's direction.Why couldn't it be a simple time travel movie? Instead it was this facetious blasphemous take on the universe and its creator: a white man that created the world with all these holes and then left the map around to be easily stolen. I was not the target audience for this film.",Time Bandits
15,neil-476,Sublime fantasy nonsense,8,5 July 2011,"The six members of Monty Python's Flying Circus had always worked together in small sub-groups before the TV series brought them together, and this practice didn't stop after the TV series finished. Time Bandits brings three of them together: Gilliam as director and writer, Palin as writer and performer, and Cleese as performer.It tells an odd story of a group of seven unprincipled individuals of diminished stature who work for the divine being, and steal a map which shows all the little gaps in space time which result from the fact that the creation of reality was not an act of flawless craftsmanship. They propose to use these gaps to embark on a career of crime, stealing valuables from one place and time, then using the map to escape elsewhere and elsewhen. There are a number of flaws in this plan: one, they're not very good at it; two, the Divine Being has a good idea what they are up to, and wants the map back; three, the Evil One also knows what they're up to, and sees the map as a useful tool to enhance his own power play; and, four, they accidentally pick up small boy Kevin on their travels.This is essentially a series of vignettes held together by a story thread which runs through everything, and it works on all levels. It has a solid story with the displaced Kevin at its centre, it is exciting and also very funny (with a running gag featuring different incarnations of characters played by Palin and Shelly Duvall), it has a unique sense of visual style about it which is typical Gilliam, and the performances are all excellent.I would single out Sean Connery for a warm Agamemnon, the family which Kevin has always been searching for), and Cleese playing Robin Hood as a visiting dignitary, but the whole thing is absolutely splendid and a complete one-off.",Time Bandits
16,Aaron1375,Good movie that could have used a few more laughs.,8,28 February 2003,"This fantasy movie is about a boy who gets caught up in time travel by these little people who go to different times and rob them.  All in all a good movie, but at times you just wish there was more comedy.  The Robin Hood time was the best as Monty Python alum John Cleese plays Hood.  It is the funniest segment in the movie.  Then the kid gets separated from his band of time travelers and ends up in sometime that isn't very funny at all.  Sean Connery plays a king here, and I like Connery a lot so it is a shame he is in the weakest section of the movie.  They also go to France during Napoleon's reign and they also have a brief stop on the Titanic as well, before the final world, which is some kind of dark realm.  There are funny scenes in this world, but there are also times this world gets to serious as well.  During all their travels a bad guy from the dark realm wants to get the time travelers to his world so he can steal their map, which shows all the time travel portals.  One thing about this movie I can't stand though is the ending...I won't dwell on it though.  If this movie had more comedy it would have been great.",Time Bandits
17,Mr-Fusion,"An odd little trip, fueled by wit and imagination",7,30 November 2015,"Even though the movie is bookended by chaos, and fueled by a sort of demented Terry Gilliam charm (not to mention the dark-but-funny violence) ""Time Bandits"" is really a kid's movie. And that's what I love about it: it's just a young boy stealing away on an adventure from his mundane existence. Add to that the trappings of a magical cosmic map, the gallop through the Napoleonic Wars, Ancient Greece and Medieval England, and a cadre of greedy dwarfs and it's a lot of fun. Even with that cast of familiar faces, David Warner handily steals the movie as Evil (like Sark from ""TRON"", only having more fun with it). And I love that the Supreme Being turns out to be a cheeky old British guy.It also ends with some sort of statement about modern technology, but that's just a last-minute zinger.

There is no real moral to the story, no funny scenes, no historic facts that are depicted near to accurate, Evil is a smoked up cliché of sadistic stupidity, really, there is NOTHING worthwhile in this film. Even the main character, a little boy, is not really main and it not really pleasant. I wonder if he was a boy.The effects are really old, the music is horrible, the only merit of this movie is that it makes you wonder what comes next.

Time Bandits is not a film for everyone, some people will get the humor in the film while others will not. This particular comedy is similar to some of the works of Monty Python or Mel Brooks - it's that type of humor.I remember falling in-love with this film as a kid - I found it hysterical.

21,Lejink,Stitches in time...,7,4 December 2008,"Before Bill & Ted and even Harry, there was...ahem...Kevin, who with his six decidedly crotchety dwarfs gets to travel back and forth through history, guarding from all-comers their precious, if dubiously acquired time-map in Terry Gilliam's entertaining fantasy. Along the way, the dumbing-down tendency of television is satirised as Gilliam and Palin as writers encourage youngsters everywhere to fore-go the dreaded box in favour of books and their own imaginations. Amen to that, but the point isn't rammed down our throats too much as director Gilliam ironically in the light of his subsequent excesses (""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" fiasco springs most readily to mind) shows just how to deliver satisfying thrills and spectacle without CGI or a multi-million dollar budget in tow. The necessarily episodic story pleasingly riffs off ""The Wizard of Oz"", right down to Kevin's ""was it all a dream"" confusion at the conclusion as real-life characters merge with those he's experienced on his travels, (although Sean Connery's fireman is first seen after the adventure's over!) and has many enjoyable set-pieces. Thus we encounter Napoleon fretting over his height with a typical Palin monologue cataloguing every other vertically challenged historical figure, Connery looks great in yet another toupee as the warrior king Agammemnon and John Cleese as a terribly polite Robin Hood. Palin himself gets a brief running cameo with Shelley Duval as unlucky lovers down the ages, with again some typically amusing and of course slightly risqué dialogue but Gilliam mixes the humour with some excellent special effects in some dramatic thrilling sequences. I'm thinking particularly of their encounter with a slumbering giant and the gang's death-defying escape from their cage at the conclusion. Being Gilliam, there is a bit of kitchen-sink excess (for example, the massed ranks of cowboys, medieval soldiers and modern military to attack David Warner's not-quite dark-enough Evil Angel) and while I'm carping, while the idea of Ralph Richardson as God might have seemed attractive on paper, the grand old man doesn't quite pull it off, seeming a trifle doddery to me. As for the little actors they're all great, fully engaged with their roles and not dwarfed (sorry!) either by their starry accompanists or outlandish sets. In fact there's something delightfully subversive and therefore naturally Pythonesque about using a bunch of dwarfs to lead off an expensive movie such as this. Spielberg wouldn't have done it this way! The young lad playing Kevin also does well even if he kept reminding me of ""The Wonder Years"" Fred Savage. In all then, a more-than-meets-the-eye family feature, all topped and tailed off with a pleasant paymaster George Harrison ditty over the end credits.",Time Bandits
22,ElMaruecan82,So what with the Six Dwarfs...,6,11 February 2017,"""If you're not failing every now and again, it's a sign you're not doing anything very innovative.""That's Woody Allen talking and you know what, the neurotic genius is right. And I had to start my review of ""Time Bandits"" with that statement for two reasons: I think the film failed to deliver its premise, but it is a failure signaling the emergence of a unique talent: Terry Gilliam, the Monty Python artist whose mind was like a laboratory of fantasy images and psychedelic extravaganza, responsible for some of the most peculiar movies of the last decades. They were not equally appealing, he's certainly one of the most divisive directors, but if you judge innovation by the frequency of failures, he might be the most innovative director. ""Time Bandits"" is about a curious and gentle little kid embarking in an time-traveling adventure, from Ancient Greece to Sherwood Forest, Napoleon Wars to the Titanic sinking, from a futuristic time to a pirates ship, with six dwarfs specializing in robbing relics and precious items from the eras they visit, this premise alone is just too irresistible for words. But for some reason that totally beats me, Terry Gilliam turns it into a rather dull, repetitive, unfunny film, one that goes uninteresting quite quickly anyway. Maybe a director like Steven Spielberg could have given it a more entertaining structure and compelling story, but Spielberg was busy making ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and then, he would make ""E.T."". There are reasons why these films are classics and ""Time Bandits"" a cult-movie mostly known by Gilliam aficionados, Spielberg knew the kind of thrills and emotional elements the audience wanted.""Time Bandits"" doesn't even provide an alternative to the ""Spielbergian"" adventure; it is an assemblage of different vignettes, all set in different times but that stopped to be impressive as the film progresses. It is worth starting by giving Caesar's what is Caesar's: the production design and settings are top notch, on an Oscar worthy level. But like it often occurs with Gilliams' movies and this one should have been another signal, Gilliam gets so carried away by all the special effects that you never get the feeling he's really directing the film, you don't get the direction, literally. Some parts stretch for far too long without providing much novelty, apart from the visual escapism, and the fact that the kid is more of a follower doesn't provide much room for gags or inventiveness. The dwarfs lead the show and it's not saying much.Don't get me wrong, there are some pretty good parts, the opening where the kid meets the six little thieves and they leave the room, followed by an ominous divine-like figure, is thrilling, unsettling and overall captivating. The Evil One, played by David Warner, is an interesting antagonist in his obsession to surpass God with a creation that would take technology as a focal point. There is also a magnificent climax that kind of redeems the flaws and perhaps provides, as Gene Siskel named it, the ultimate rescue, from any movie, but then it is also ruined by a rather bizarre and abrupt ending. And watching the show with Ebert and Siskel, I could see a glee in Siskel's eyes, he wanted to recommend the film but found it too boring. And I agree, I can't recommend this film that feels like a draft of ""Munchausen"" which wasn't flawless anyway.Ebert liked the film a little more but there was no enthusiasm in his eyes, and he conceded that kids might enjoyed it for what it was, a series of adventures in different settings, maybe like a video game or a Tintin book. I don't even think he's right. First, the film is just too long even by adult movies' standards, it drags on for two hours and not every scene is indispensable. It could have done without the Titanic part where the special effects didn't match the previous parts. Secondly, the kid is a passive character, he doesn't even have the biting wit of Sally in ""Munchausen"", he's an adorable little boy who just follows the dwarfs and that's it. There's no coming-of-age element of any sort, no real change of character's arc, I wouldn't underestimate the kids and take for granted that they don't expect a character's arc. Finally, the tone oscillates between moments of sophisticated wits and surrealistic confrontations that might disconcert children.Maybe ""Time Bandits"" tries to be something between ""Tron"" and ""The Man Who Would be King"", with a mixture of Monty Python flavor, a video game of Kiplingesque magnitude, I guess, but it just comes anachronistic compared to what the 80's had to offer and not just Spielberg, a film like ""The Princess' Bride"" has got the wit, the warmth and the charm ""Time Bandits"" is lacking. Maybe Gilliam takes its setting, and casting (Sean Connery, John Cleese, Patrick Vaughan and many of Gilliam regulars) for granted and doesn't care for showing some real warmth or depth in the characters, so even as a kids' movie, it doesn't quite succeed.Now, it all comes down to a dilemma, either you praise the film but not with enthusiasm or you condemn it with magnanimity. This is a film full of good intentions, but in its own right as a two-hour spectacle, you better have something to do while you're watching it, it's not really an attention grabber.",Time Bandits
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Thieves in time.,6,14 July 2020,"'Time Bandits (1981)' is rather strange, an odd and quirky concoction that could, perhaps, only have come from someone as historically offbeat as Gilliam. It focuses on a group of time-travelling thieves who accidentally recruit a young boy as they run away from their master with a stolen map. The premise is promising and, on occasion, the affair starts to live up to it. However, it also falls short in a number of areas and, on the whole, isn't quite as charming as it really needs to be. Still, it's a decent amount of fun when it gets going. The characters are all likeable enough and it's entertaining to see the different time-periods, complete with historical caricatures and Python cameos, that the central team stumble into. It's full of anachronisms, of course, but that doesn't matter. This is fantasy, through and through. Sadly, though the finale itself is fairly fun, the actual ending is weird and half-baked. It kind of seems like the filmmakers didn't know how to end this bizarre, mostly moral-less adventure. 6/10",Time Bandits
24,bowmanblue,Please never let this film be remade,10,14 July 2017,"Sometimes a film comes along that is so damn perfect that we can only pray to the Gods who rule over greedy Hollywood producers that they never sully the good name of 'Time Bandits.' In case you haven't guessed – I'm a fan. It's a story about a child that isn't necessarily FOR children. A young lad named Kevin wakes up one night to find, er, a knight, rampaging through his bedroom. And, to the film's extra credit, only a few scenes later the adventure is underway proper when the very next evening, the armoured medieval warrior on horseback is replaced by a gang of foul-mouthed and foul-tempered dwarfs who have stolen the Supreme Being's map of the universe and are now in the process of exploiting the various 'holes' in time for financial gain.Yeah, it's a bit weird. And a bit 'out there,' but then it's directed by no less than Terry Gilliam. 'Who's that?' you ask. Okay, so you're probably under thirty and aren't that aware of that oh so influential comedy troupe Monty Python's Flying Circus. Gilliam was basically the sixth Python who mainly stayed behind the camera drawing crazy cartoons of giant feet and killer prams. In other words, he's well used to weirdness and it shows in every frame. Now, despite also featuring fellow Pythons John Cleese and Michael Palin, don't get fooled into thinking that this is just a 'Monty Python the Movie' (like their other big screen epics 'Life of Brian' and 'The Holy Grail'). Although it does have many weird and surreal qualities as Kevin and the seven dwarfs (I'm not sure there are exactly seven, but near enough) skip through time, doing their best to steal everything that isn't nailed down, while, at the same time, avoiding the wrath of our Creator. However, it never feels like it's set in the same 'Python' universe (sorry if I make it sound like Marvel's shared cinematic universe!).As I mentioned at the beginning, 'Time Bandits' is much darker in tone and, despite Kevin being young and innocent, he's often placed in real danger and faced with many disturbing images and situations that may well upset a younger audience. However, regardless of his young age, the actor himself plays it well and is never less than enjoyable to watch, evoking a real sense of sympathy in him due to his homelife and desire to better himself. This is placed in direct contrast to the dwarfs who are little more than common criminals and yet we still find ourselves rooting for them because they are literally the underdogs and humorous to boot. In every time period they seem to end up in brings the opportunity for one celebrity cameo after the next. As I've already said a couple of familiar Pythons pop up, but expect appearances from Ian Holm and even Sean Connery (who maintains his trademark Scottish drawl despite being a Greek king!).With great characters, great actors, a weird and wonderful story filled with practical effects that would make Michael Bay weep and an end battle scene that is different enough to put any recent Hollywood fist fight or superhero movie to shame, it's hard to say anything negative about 'Time Bandits.' It's a true cult classic that is as delightful (in a dark kind of way) today as it ever was. If I had to dwell on anything minor it might be how this sort of film just isn't appreciated any more by (the majority of) the youth. I can see it forever maintaining a special place in many of my generation's hearts, but, as the years go by, less and less people will be interested in a quirky little tale involving spaceships and Minotaurs and, instead, prefer men in iron suits flying round cities swatting an army of computer-generated aliens. Nothing wrong with that, but I think there should always be room for different types of films. And they don't come much different than 'Time Bandits.' If you love quirky. If you love Python and if you love practical effects then you have to have to watch this before it gets remade and computer generated to extinction.",Time Bandits

28,Bored_Dragon,"Comparison with ""Brazil"" is blasphemous",6,15 October 2018,"When I saw Gilliam's ""Brazil"" I was amazed, so I googled about it and found out it was part of so-called ""Trilogy of Imagination"". Naturally, I decided to see the other two movies. ""Time Bandits"" is the first part of this trilogy and tells the story about eleven years old boy who accidentally joins a group of time-traveling stealing dwarfs. The story leads us to the palace of King Agamemnon, in Sherwood and in the midst of Napoleon's conquests, but if, based on this brief description, you expect good entertainment, you will be disappointed. The premise is interesting, but the realization in the form of fairy-tale adventure for children does not offer almost anything to adults. With the film ""Brazil"" this achievement shares a similar ""feeling"", great camera and directing, and effects are really good for its time. The cast is at the very least fascinating and includes names such as John Cleese, Sean Connery, Shelley Duvall, Ian Holm, Michael Palin, Ralph Richardson, Peter Vaughan, David Warner, and Jim Broadbent. But the story itself is poorly written. A lot of random events, too chaotic to be receptive to children, and meaningless to adults. There is no real plot here, but only interesting ideas scattered through the futile film, and if the aim was a satire, I must admit I noticed some here and there, but nothing more than that. True, the movie somewhat holds attention because it keeps you in anticipation of what's coming. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is - nothing. If it was not technically so good and with such a great cast, I would probably give up on it halfway through.6,5/10",Time Bandits
29,The-Sarkologist,A rather dark jaunt through history,8,9 February 2013,"It seems that when it comes to Terry Gilliam movies you either love him or you hate him, and I have to say that I tend to fall into the former category. Gilliam just seems to have a special way in which he makes his movies that not only make them enjoyable, but that they are also rewatchable, amusing, and very entertaining, not to mention that they also seem to have a unique fantasy quality about them. Also, being the guy that directed the Life of Brian, he also have more than just a number of detractors, though Life of Brian tends to come under the heading of Monty Python (despite the fact that he tends to direct all of their movies anyway).This movie is focused around a young boy that discovers that his bedroom happens to have a time hole in it, and this is discovered after a knight runs through his room one night on a horse. So, the very next night he packs a satchel of things that might be needed on an adventure (including a Polaroid camera) and waits until a bunch of dwarfs come barreling out of his closet, and are then chased by the Supreme Being to another time, and thus the adventure begins.Basically these dwarfs have stolen a map from the Surpreme Being and are using this map, which contains the locations and destinations of the numerous time holes scattered throughout the universe, to rob and loot. However they are not very good at it, particularly since every time they make a haul, they immediately lose it, first after having it taken from them by Robin Hood, and the next time seeing it sink to the bottom of the Atlantic after the Titanic crashes into an ice berg.The film is sort of like Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure, but in a way much better. Where the later film has Bill and Ted traveling through time to pass their history assignment so that they might become saviours of the world, this film is simply about a bunch of dwarfs attempting to being thieves, and completely failing. Of course there is the protagonist, who is only known as evil, and we also have the Supreme Being that is not as bad as Evil, though he is portrayed as not a nice person if you get on the wrong side of him.In a way this film is actually a lot darker than Bill and Ted's, and I guess that is Gilliam's style. We have Napoleon who is obsessed with height, and if there is one thing that he does not like, it is people who are taller than him. Of course, seeing him sitting among the ruins of a city that he has just captured laughing his head off at a Punch and Judy show is just classic python. Upon meeting Kevin and the Dwarfs, he then immediately makes them his generals, simply because they are shorter than him.Then there is Robin Hood, as played by John Cleese, who is so caught up in his idealism that he really does not see how rotten his Merry Men are. Notice that he does not blink an eyelid when his second in command (I suspect it is Little John) punches the peasant after Robin hands out the treasure to him. I guess what we are seeing here is a demythologising of the myths of our world, though notice how Agamemnon is portrayed as the idea father figure (not that the Greek section of this movie is anything close to the original, except for the mentioning of Mycene as the city in which they live).There are numerous scenes in this film I particularly like, and it have all of the Monty Python style humour as well, such as the ogre and his wife having a normal conversation, and then bursting into a series of roars. In fact, I would probably have to say that the Ogre is probably my favourite character in the film, though the dwarfs all have their time in the sun as well. What I do find very interesting about this film is that Sean Connery is the top billed actor despite him only playing a supporting role, if that. I wonder if Connery insisted on being the top billed actor simply because he is Sean Connery.",Time Bandits

I didn't rewatch it for over 20 years and they next time I seen it, I got a free copy with a newspaper (Still the copy in my collection today) and I actually turned it off thinking ""How on earth did I ever like this??"" And put it down to being a child. So I wasn't sure what I'd think watching it now!! I chose to watch it with my 11 year old son, who had never seen it. Connery doesn't appear till the 45 min mark, and there isn't much for him to do really before he departs about 10 minutes later. He pops up to utter 2 lines as a foreman right at the end, in an ending that was reshot long after filming was completed to include Connery when he was in a London to meet his accountant.This had the potential to be hilarious, but it just isn't!! I still struggled to get through this, but my son seemed to enjoy it ""it was OK. But I wouldn't call it a Sean Connery movie"" was his assessment!! Some movies still make me feel like a child, but this isn't one of them. The ending is quite a surprise if you have never seen it though.Connery widely signed on for a percentage of the gross instead of a fee. This turned out to be a brilliant movie as Time Bandits was the 10th highest grossing movie of 1981, grossing $42 million at the domestic box office. Once again (like in Murder On The Orient Express and A Bridge Too Far) Connery scored big when he wasn't the main attraction of the movie.",Time Bandits
31,tomgillespie2002,One of the definitive movies about childhood,8,18 September 2013,"If you were once a young boy (or girl) who enjoyed riding their bike at breakneck speed or got their thrills from wandering off to places you were forbidden to go to, then you will totally get Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits. If adventure and danger were what spurred you on as a child, then you no doubt fantasised about travelling through time and meeting the famous historical figures you learned about whilst falling asleep in history class. Time Bandits is pure Boys Own adventure, making idiots out of the likes of Robin Hood and Napoleon, and even bringing six dwarfs along for the ride. The plot is muddled and nonsensical, but the plot is beside the point - arguably just a McGuffin for some childish fun.It tells the story of eleven year old Kevin (Craig Warnock), who, when not being ignored by his lazy absent-minded parents, spends his time doting on history, particularly Ancient Greece. One night, six dwarfs come crashing out of his wardrobe holding a map that they claim show the world's time portals, that they appear to have stolen from the Supreme Being (i.e. God, played at the climax by the wonderful Ralph Richardson). Kevin goes along for the ride, and finds himself meeting Napoleon (Ian Holm) during the Napoleonic Wars, Robin Hood (John Cleese) in the Middle Ages, and King Agamenmon (Sean Connery) in Ancient Greece (amongst others). Meanwhile, in the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, the technologically obsessed Evil (David Warner) is planning to steal the map and take over the world.The set design is fantastic in this film, and the main credit should go to that department. The sets look as if constructed from the mind of a child, paying no real attention to historical detail or a 'lived-in' feel - this is all pure fantasy. The film rushes at such a breakneck speed that we don't get to spend enough time with these characters in their times, and this was my main (and only) problem with Time Bandits. Thankfully, these scenes are packed with so much wit by writers Gilliam and Michael Palin (who also appears as the dim-witted romantic Vincent), that it is hard to care too much. This is not Monty Python though, there is humour here for children and adults both, but it's just as funny. John Cleese's over-enthusiastic Robin Hood was a particular stand-out for me.Gilliam also uses the film to take some sly satirical digs at the emergence of technology, juxtaposing Evil's plan to use computers to carry out his evil deeds alongside Kevin's active imagination and sense of wonder. His parents are bone-idle idiots that get excited at the idea of a microwave cooking their dinner in quick time, and technology is clearly viewed by Gilliam as something that will rot the imagination. This isn't entirely true of course - technology can inspire innovation - but I often see young children staring open mouthed and expressionless at their mobile phones when they should be annoying their parents or getting up to something they shouldn't be, so I can certainly sympathise with Gilliam's concerns. But Time Bandits is mainly about adventure and the wonder of a child's imagination. Funny, manic, and occasionally moving, this is one of the definitive movies about childhood, and how we occasionally long for it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Time Bandits
32,johnnyboyz,"In spite of a lack of real stone-wall substance, Time Bandits is a jolly and hearty romp through mankind's ages combining the terrifying with the exciting with the sombre.",6,14 August 2011,"Time Banidts is a giddy, quite riotous science fiction comedy blurring lines between what is a young boy's fantasy and an unnerving, stone-wall reality running perfectly in tow with the ambiguities that surround it being a family orientated comedy or just a flat out horror film. What the film lacks in concrete narrative, or indeed any apparent characterisation, it makes up for in brutish energy and sheer outlandishness; the film effectively an episodic bounding from decade to decade, era to era, historical time zone to historical time zone covering a handful of scurrying, genuinely funny characters doing what they do for certain outlandish reasons - all of which we find immensely charming. The film strikes us as being of a mould more broadly representative of what one's imaginary fantasy games from childhood might have represented, and yet in spite of its consummate rejection of anything necessarily nostalgic, there is a neat balance throughout of child-like glee and ruffled, eyes-down dramatics that combine well. It is very much the sort of film that ends up with a scene in which the infamous Nottinghamshire outlaw Robin Hood stands in one of Sherwood forest's clearings fawning over the majesty of the Mona Lisa; a scene surmising the film's uncanny sense of ambition and its infectious array of ideas in what is a tough film to ultimately dislike.The piece is that of early Terry Gilliam; its flitting nature and ability to whisk characters, whom we genuinely like, away on madcap adventures, to what appear unreal locations, is an approach to filmmaking that is evident here as well as later on in the bulk of his big-screen work. Examples range from 1988's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen to that of 2009's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, by way of what strikes me as his best work in Twelve Monkeys; each of them films dramatising people with a great object at their disposal, and of which lies at the centre of the film, which they're able to utilise as a means of coming into contact with the close-to-unreal for whatever reasons. Looking back over his work, we find the the separate strands of love triangles and centuries-long debts to The Devil that he weaves into ""Parnassus"" as wondrous material to go against the backdrop of fantasy; likewise, the Seven Samurai pastiche brought to Baron Munchausen tied in really well with an array of characters rediscovering their purpose in life – 1995's Twelve Monkeys was a tale of disturbing apocalyptic realisation which works incredibly well mostly every time you see it.Time Bandits falls a little below these high watermarks; the film limited to being an amusing excursion into creative fantasy filmmaking, but that is about it. We follow a young English boy named Kevin (Warnock), someone with a real enthusiasm for history and historical figures; his room drenched in figurines and such iconography inferring this. He lives in a quaint suburban street in a small house with his mother and father, two relatively soulless people whom subscribe to consumerism; feel the need to 'top' their neighbours in this field and find it tough to answer relatively trivial questions featured on a television quiz show that even has the contestants struggle. Kevin's life is lackluster and somewhat routine - his world shrouded in philistinism and, by way of the contestants' performance on the quiz show, idiocy; his escape away from it his textbooks detailing rich and activity-laden periods in mankind's existence, worlds away from his droll housing estate entity of eating one's dinner, watching one's parents slouch in front of a television and being sent to bed with his books he must read illegally if he is to do so at all.One evening, he witnesses a horse mounted knight appear out of his wardrobe and rear in surprise at Kevin's presence before disappearing again; the staying up in order to try and catch this incredible act, or something like, the reaction to such an occurrence. What does occur is the bumbling into his room by that of a collection of dwarfs, the titular time bandits, whom utilise a space and time rift machine in the form of a map they stole from God himself to now use to whizz from place in history to place in history garnering treasure and riches. The bandits are led uneasily by that of Randall (Rappaport); someone overseeing that of five others and now Kevin, whose bedroom they stumbled into and whom tags along with them on their travels. Looming over proceedings, in his lair rife with disillusioning iconography, stands David Warner's nameless evil being gazing on through his crystal ball desiring the map for his own ill-gain.Where the film treads from there is into a neat routine of episodes with varying content, ranging from that of needing to help an ancient Greek warrior played by Sean Connery slay a Minotaur, to that of hitching a ride on the scalp of a giant whom rises out of the ocean. An overlying tract of times of old appearing alluring and, despite their brutality or general nature, being exciting or the sort of era one would rather live in if it means escaping from the modern life of materialism and so forth, prominent. In spite of the danger Kevin finds himself in, rarely does he, nor the audience, desire the quest to necessarily conclude; the good, honest fun culminating in a dizzy finale tough to take seriously but easy to slot into. It is not without his moments, a specific line: ""So that's what invisible forcefields look like"" neatly encapsulating the oft laid back nature of the dialogue despite the surreal nature of the situations, whereas one man's theological rant on why various species of parrot exist is amusing. Alas, we are not as involved as we are in other Gilliam films; the film, like Kevin's tag-along flitting from century to century, a pleasing excursion into the irrelevant aided by the presence of an odd joy.",Time Bandits

34,Movie_Muse_Reviews,And '80s fantasy epic with a bizarre Gilliam twist,7,12 August 2012,"Well, you knew Terry Gilliam wasn't going to make a traditional contribution to the '80s fantasy/adventure canon. ""Time Bandits"" might be the oddest film ever intended for family audiences. Only the writer/director's second non-""Monty Python"" film after 1977's ""Jabberwocky,"" Gilliam infuses purposefully odd humor and nonsensical characters and events in this smorgasbord of an epic.Kevin (Craig Warnock) is an imaginative young boy whose parents are obsessed with ""As Seen on TV""-style kitchen appliances and other material objects, but he doesn't have to worry about them for long when a band of dwarfs climb out of his wardrobe and whisk him away on an adventure throughout time in search of treasure.The dwarfs are not all that different from Kevin's parents; they seek only to amass treasure despite being in possession of a map that shows all the world's time holes, Kevin sees this as a quite a waste of a gift, but there's not much he can do — and it beats being at home. The five dwarfs, Randall (David Rappaport), Fidgit (Kenny Baker, a.k.a. R2-D2), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds) and Wally (Jack Purvis) are a delightful bunch. Gilliam shoots the film at their level, and you really see them for their acting ability, not simply their stature.Complicating their journey from Napoleon France to the Middle Ages to Ancient Greece and beyond is that they're being pursued by the Wizard of Oz-like Supreme Being, a sort of euphemism for God, who wants his map back, while the Evil Genius (David Warner) tries to lure them to his Fortress of Ultimate Darkness to steal the map and recreate the world in his own evil image. Evil Genius is an extreme caricature of the force of evil equipped with a bizarre bent only Gilliam seems truly capable of.Whatever statements Gilliam and co-writer Michael Palin wish to make about God/Satan or good/evil get lost fairly quickly in the countless strange events that occur in each of the journey's pit stops. After sinking with the Titanic, they get caught in an ogre's fishing net only the ogre has back pains that distract him from being menacing. In moments like those the film feels as its most ""Python.""Although we're only peppered with the humor of ""Time Bandits,"" Gilliam's imagination never lags for even a moment. He undoubtedly proves himself a man of tremendous vision, even though a child would be more likely to be terrified of it than appreciate its combination of dark and eccentric.""Time Bandits"" is truly an adventure to behold. The journey of its hero plays second fiddle, but there's enough swirling metaphor and symbolism for the child's imagination going on that we understand what he's going through and identify with it personally. The ending does but another weird cap on things, but it gels with the unexpected nature of most everything else in the film.Gilliam embraces fantasy and historical fantasy archetypes with a fervor nearly equal to his desire to chop them into weirdly shaped pieces before serving them to us. ""Time Bandits"" is consequently as familiar as it is spontaneous and silly. Although not the staple of its genre, it certainly must be described as timeless.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I'm not the hugest Connery fan (especially his lame modern movies, Entrapment was just awful) but in this role he had the right warmth, humor, and power to play Agammemnon.  This movie is very silly, and that' all part of the fun, so I don't think it was a method performance or anything like that, OK?, give the guy a break.  Connery had been way too serious up to that point in his career.  Anyway, I love all the actors, Gilliam is as usually absolutely perfect and very inventive.  This is the best ""midget"" movie of all time (yes, even better than the Wizard of Oz and Under the Rainbow) because it shows the little people as real human beings. Even though there is not much time for characterization given the huge cast of character actors/cameo stars, each of the bandits has his own personality that contributes to the chemistry of the group.  The boy who plays Kevin is pretty bad, but I never think the term ""actor"" should be applied to children.  A final note:  I could swear that when I first saw this movie in Virginia when it came out (I was 6) the soundtrack on the movie included ""Let's Get Physical"" by Olivia Newton John.  This might just be the effect of my youth at the time, I don't know but if anyone else remembers this, let me know, OK?  :)",Time Bandits
36,funkyfry,The greatest midget film of all time,10,5 November 2002,"The best midget film I've ever seen.  Why?  Lots of reasons, because it includes all the best elements of midget exploitation (Ian Holm's Napoleon is priceless) but it also invests each little person character with a personality.  The story is a Monty Python dream, one of Gilliam's best movies.... funny and sadistic.  I saw it as a kid and loved it.  What can I say?  I truly wish there could be more movies like this.When I saw it as a kid, I must have been 5 or 6 years old.  I seem to remember Olivia Newton John's ""Let's Get Physical"" being on the soundtrack, but when I tell anyone this they look at me like I'm crazy.  Does anyone know if this was ever distributed in such a form (I know it's not impossible, because pop songs are often tastelessly added to films in America after production if the film isn't doing so well in the box office)?Recommended to everyone.",Time Bandits
37,Anonymous_Maxine,This is a science fiction classic in the vein of The Goonies and Labyrinth.,8,28 August 2000,"Time Bandits is an extremely imaginative fantasy film, and it clearly did not have the budget to make it as spectacular as it could have been. However, keeping in mind how many years ago it was made, it is a very respectable effort. The film is about a young boy who accidently winds up time traveling with a band of midgets who travel through time robbing people. Hence, Time Bandits. Their adventures through time are fascinating to watch, especially scenes like their run-in with the hilariously polite Robin Hood (played wonderfully by John Cleese). The final goal of the midgets is to find the ""greatest object on the face of the earth,"" and their efforts to obtain it provide for wonderful entertainment. While Time Bandits may not be for all tastes, it is definitely an excellent adventure film that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. It is a trip through the imagination, and a hilarious ending involving the young boy's parents adds to the great fun of it all. If you are a fan of films like The Goonies and Labyrinth (which everyone is), don't miss Time Bandits.",Time Bandits
38,Vartiainen,Wandering adventure through time and imagination,7,25 November 2019,"An early Terry Gilliam film and the first part in his Imagination trilogy, which explores possible escape routes from the banality of modern society. In this case through the eyes of a child, with Brazil and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen providing the point of views of an adult and an elder, respectively.Time Bandit tells about Kevin (Craig Warnock), whose bedroom is accidentally assaulted by a group of dwarfs, who have stolen a map from the Supreme Being and are using it to travel through time, stealing riches and pulling schemes. Kevin ends up joining their troupe and together they go all over the place, from Napoleonic France to Ancient Greece to a land of myths and legends. To name a few.What I really like about this movie is its imagination and its good cheer. All Terry Gilliam films are certainly not lacking in the former, but this is perhaps the first film I've seen from him where cynicism takes a backseat and we're simply allowed to have an adventure. Sure, there's still commentary, but it's relatively mild, at least in comparison to his other films. Not to say his other films don't have adventures. They certainly have, as well as many things that awoke the feelings of splendor and awe. It's just that they're usually conveyed to us through jaded eyes. Which is not a bad thing in and on itself, but I have to admit that I prefer this film's tone to those other films.And sure, the plot is meandering and not all that cohesive. Rather like The Adventures of Baron Munchausen some years later, if you've seen that film. Still, it's all in good fun and the film certainly has beauty and wonder in abundance to keep you hooked.If you're looking for something unique, something with an identity, then this film is definitely worth checking out.",Time Bandits

Kevin enjoys reading about history, mainly ancient Greece. When Kevin goes to bed one night a Medieval Knight on horseback jumps out from his wardrobe and through his wall. This takes him by surprise and wants to see if it happens again. During the second night six dwarfs come out from his wardrobe and are being chased. Kevin goes with them and find out they have a map to all the holes in the universe which gives them the chance to time travel. Kevin also finds out that they are thieves, planning on robbing historical figures of their riches, a plot that was later used in Futurama: Bender's Big Score. As well, the dwarfs were being chased by the Superme Being, i.e. God. As well the group were being watched by the Evil One, who wants to use the map to re-make the universe in his own image.The Monty Phyton team have one hell of an imagine, coming up with brilliant ideas. Time Bandits wouldn't have been made in Hollywood. It is a visual treat and is a funny film. It has visual jokes and clever lines. The performances by the dwarfs were excellent, and Cleese's and Palin's cameos were a nice extra. Sean Connery was also well casted as King Agamemnon when Kevin was in Accient Greece. The film also uses its themes of religion and time travel to it limits which was needed. Terry Giliam did an excellent job directing, and he has done brilliant films from Monty Phyton and the Holy Grail, Brazil and Twelve Monkeys.Time Bandits is a smart family film, with elements for Monty Phyton fans to enjoy. 4 out of 5.",Time Bandits

41,MissSimonetta,I wish more family films were like this one...,9,9 August 2016,"Most family films are made with marketing at the forefront of the producers' minds. Toys, tie-ins, demographics all trump creativity and creating a work that will last. Thank the Lord, Terry Gilliam is not such a filmmaker and Time Bandits is not such a movie.A kid tags along with a band of thieving dwarfs on the run from their employer, God Himself (played by none other than Ralph Richardson), as they travel through time and take whatever loot they can. What ensues is a series of off-the-wall adventures, encounters with strange characters, and satire jabs at consumerism and the modern world's obsession with technology. It is a film both children and adults can equally appreciate, if they go along with the strangeness.Time Bandits is not going to appeal to everyone-- it's weird and strangely paced, but it's so unique and funny that I cannot help but love it and return to it again and again.",Time Bandits
42,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Exciting, gorgeous looking time travel adventure",9,24 March 2015,"I'm a huge fan of Terry Gilliam's unique visual storytelling style, and I can say that this has to be his most visually effective film. No expenses are spared as every frame is filled to the brim with opulent, period detailed, eye boggling set design and special effects. Moreover, this being released in 1981, all of the effects are of the old fashioned, practical variety, which take much more work than cgi and the payoff is enormous. Gilliam's films are somewhat hit and miss, but I consider this to be a tremendous success, enrapturing and exciting from beginning to end, if not for a few overly silly bits, but you can expect at least a few loopy touches from the creators of Monty Python.Kevin, a smart young kid, is hijacked by a sextet of sassy time travelling dwarfs on the run from their employer, the Supreme Being (a delightfully droll Ralph Richardson), and taken on a madcap odyssey across a network of portals, each leading to a different era in history. Along the way they encounter the Evil Genius (David Warner having a ball in devilish rockstar steampunk getup), intent on stealing their time leaping secrets and unleashing his nefarious plan on the universe.Time Bandits is a sweeping, wholly immersing, visually striking, phenomenally entertaining film that never panders to a young audience by shying away from dark or ominous tones, and always maintains its rip roaring momentum.

44,slokes,Dry Run For Munchausen,4,4 January 2007,"While this is a film Terry Gilliam's many fans no doubt enjoy, few honest ones would classify ""Time Bandits"" as among his best films. With ""Brazil"" or the lost '80s classic ""The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen"" you get vision, story, and humor. Here you just get vision.""Time Bandits"" has a great concept at least: Little Kevin (Craig Warnock) lives with his uncaring parents in a house stocked with modern conveniences, daydreaming of ancient Greece. Suddenly out of his bedroom closet, Narnia-style, pop six tiny men, escapees from the Supreme Being, carrying with them a map identifying wormholes through time. One step ahead of the Creator, under the baleful eye of Evil, the six sweep Kevin across history in search of plunder.There are solid aspects to ""Time Bandits,"" especially the performance of David Rappaport as Randall, leader of the bandit gang. More than any other actor in the film, he presents a comic lightness, whether strung up upside-down and trying to impress his captor by snarling at him (""They always crack in the end"") or dog-paddling in the North Atlantic after landing his gang on the Titanic. (""It didn't say 'Get off before the iceberg' on the ticket.')David Warner also has moments as the sinister face of Evil, less as the figure of menace he presents in the second half of the film than the goofy, insecure techno-loving whiner early on. ""If I were creating a world, I wouldn't mess about with butterflies or daffodils. I would have started with lasers, eight o'clock, day one.""What isn't nearly as funny are the many time periods Kevin and his little friends find themselves in. Whether meeting a patronizing Robin Hood or a Napoleon who gets his kicks watching tiny people hit each other, these bits consistently disappoint as comedy and create nothing tangible in the way of a plot. They are just an excuse for Monty Python vets Gilliam and Michael Palin to string together a group of unconnected sketches like they did in the old days.Except these sketches aren't funny, not even with Palin and fellow Python John Cleese on hand in cameo roles. Cleese carries his one joke playing Robin Hood as snobby nobleman just long enough for it to get tired, while Palin overacts shamefully as a lovelorn fellow chasing Shelley Duvall across time and forever getting crossed up. Given Cleese and Palin were the two funniest Pythons, this is disappointing.So too is the second half of the film, where Gilliam and Palin lose the tiny thread of their story and decide to move the action into a more mystical realm, sending Kevin and the gang to ""The Time Of Legends."" Here the story and special effects become even more threadbare, while the comedy is limited to a giant with a bad back who says he feels ""horrible"" when he feels great and vice versa.SPOILER AHEAD-- The most entertaining thing about reading the comments here are how the many champions of ""Time Bandits"" justify the film's mercilessly mean ending. Gilliam may talk today about his message being not to trust heroes, but there's nothing about heroes in the ending, just a small boy alone and orphaned in the world, victim of an uncaring cosmos. My belief is Gilliam stuck it in precisely because it went against the grain of his movie, and showed he wasn't getting soft. No sentimentalist he. --SPOILER ENDThe one sequence of the film I enjoyed most is the one time Gilliam gets a bit sentimental, when Kevin gets stranded alone in Mycenae and meets Agamemnon in the person of Sean Connery. Connery's star power was never brighter, and Gilliam gets the maximum value from his Morocco set. It's not funny, but no jokes are better than the weak ones scattered across the rest of the picture. At least here Gilliam is trying to create a story.It quickly passes, and so does everything else, including the time you spend watching this. It leaves a hollow feeling, proving if nothing else this film is aptly named.",Time Bandits
45,dworldeater,Brilliant,10,17 December 2015,"I would say for the most part, the entertainment(music, movies)that I enjoyed as kid I still like as an adult. Time Bandits, holds up way better than most and as time goes on, I actually appreciate the film more. Time Bandits has a lot going for it. It is a unique fantasy film that is intelligent, funny, well made and all around entertaining. This very unconventional adventure is carried well by young Craig Warnock who plays Kevin(who is very smart and grounds the film) and our most outstanding gang of little people who stole a map of creation from God, to go through time to rob history blind. This sets them on course to The Fortress Of Ultimate Darkness where Evil(played by the great David Warner) has his own plans for the map and plans to recreate the world in his image. Also John Cleese, Shelly Duvall and Sean Connery all appear in memorable, well used cameos. This came from the mind of genius Terry Gilliam who wrote this in a weekend and directed this as well. While this movie is appropriate entertainment for the whole family, it never comes across as cheesy or dumbed down. It is also very unpretentious, lighthearted and moves along quickly. Time Bandits holds up better than most and I have never seen anything else that is quite like it.",Time Bandits
46,TOMNEL,"Nonstop action/adventure from start to finish, but almost like an unsuccessful anthology in it's set-up.",6,9 August 2009,"Director/writer/actor Terry Gilliam is known for making fantastical fantasy films that stretch the creative mind. I'd like to say this film stretched the creative mind, but in reality all it ever did is poke at it, and tease it. We're given a lot of potential for a great film, and a lot of great set pieces, wonderful entertainers (Monty Python's John Cleese and Michael Palin), and a script with many moments of good comedy, but what it comes down to, is that this film's disjointedness ruins it's potential of being great.Kevin (Craig Warnock) is thrown into a fantastical world when six greedy little people (aka the Time Bandits) land in his room through a time vortex. Kevin ends up falling into another vortex with these men, and goes through various times and places, along the way meeting Napolean (Ian Holm), Robinhood (John Cleese), King Agamemnon (Sean Connery). They are stopped in their path by the Evil Genis (David Wariner), who is trying to become the Supreme Being and beat out God.Most of this movie's problems come in it's structure. The main villain isn't established until fairly far into the film, and it isn't until the climax that the villain gets any screen time over five minutes. We're also thrown into the plot very early, and once it's realized what's going on, it becomes an anthology. The first hour plus is going from well known historical set piece to well known historical set piece. It's interesting to see Gilliams take on history, but at the same time it never establishes anything about the film, or the characters (except that the Time Bandits want to get rich, and Kevin wants out).For the positives, the acting is good, and the film is fairly consistently at least entertaining. There's a lot of quirky funny characters from different times, and then there's one who really isn't funny at all...Sean Connery as Agamemnon. It's not that Connery did a bad job, it's just he was not given one joke, or one funny thing to say. It's just like he's there, for the sake of being there. Still Connery gives a good performance, as does everyone else involved. The ending of the movie is so bizarre, but also hilarious. It's an ending to be remembered, as I still remembered it 10 plus years after watching the film.Overall, this movie is entertaining. It's got good characters, and it looks very stylish. But, you may find yourself wishing for a more substantial plot, and perhaps a little more center.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 115 mins. PG for some language, crude innuendos and violence.",Time Bandits
47,caspian1978,A Variety of Python,8,26 February 2005,"Terry Gilliam, with the help from George Harrison's wallet, created a Paradise Lost landscape where Python eventually wins. The rules are broken in Time Bandits. The story is a mixture of comedy and science fiction. An interesting idea made into an interesting movie, the end result is a movie that has never been topped. John Cleese and Sean Connery star alongside Shelley Duvall and Michael Palin in a Python type movie that happens to resemble every Python film ever made. There are moments of Jabberwocky as well as Meaning of Life and Life of Brian in Time Bandits. Much like the wardrobe in Holy Grail, Time Bandits seems to borrow a little bit of all of Terry Gilliam's movies. A wonderful role by Ian Holm who plays the small role of Napoleon. This was just practice for him, as he would later go on to play the role of Napoleon again. The big stars of the movie are the 6 little characters David Rappaport, Kenny Baker, Malcolm Dixon, Mike Edmonds, Jack Purvis and Tiny Ross. The late great David Rappaport is timeless. Having been gone for over 15 years, he is the biggest link in the cast, he not only holds the movie together, he is the center piece to the entire film. Bravo little man.",Time Bandits
48,Steffi_P,"""Heroes? What do they know about a day's work?""",9,6 April 2007,"Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits is that rare thing  a kid's film that really understands and respects children. It is also, after the hotch-potch of Jabberwocky, Gilliam's first fully-fledged feature film.Time Bandits is about the power of a child's imagination, particularly in the face of the dullness of bland TV. Kevin's family home, packed with high-tech labour-saving devices, seems cramped and puckered up, and is dwarfed by the grandeur of the historical settings. It's not an anti-technology statement as such, but more an attack on the impersonal nature of modern gadgetry, which Gilliam would come back to in his masterpiece, Brazil.This is also a film about the problems of childhood. Kevin is ignored by his parents, and his imagination is stifled. But when he is with the dwarfs, he becomes listened to and respected. It's the antithesis of the statement ""children should be seen and not heard"". Gilliam also goes a long way to creating a ""child's (or dwarfs) eye view"", both physically, keeps his camera at waist height (making Ralph Richardson look absolutely huge) and in terms of the film's outlook. For example, most of the comedy comes from ridiculing the worries of the adult world  Napoleon's anxiety over his height, the ogres mid-life crisis and, of course, Michael Palin's ""problem"".The fact that the story is about time travelling allows Gilliam to flex his imagination to the greatest extent since his days as Monty Python animator. Travelling from one historical setting to another, and eventually into the realms of fantasy, Gilliam must really have felt like a kid with the biggest train set in the world (to paraphrase Orson Welles). The story is incredibly fast-paced and we never dwell too long in one era, but Gilliam still manages to cram as many ideas as possible into each setting. The fifteen minutes or so set in the middle ages is funnier than the entirety of Jabberwocky. One of the few similarities to Jabberwocky in fact is Gilliam's warts-and-all portrayal of history.And how could I forget to mention the dwarfs? This is their picture too, and alongside the ideas about childhood this is also a rarity in that it actors with dwarfism a chance to play real characters, rather than just be body type ""specialists"". And there truly are some great actors among them. David Rapapport (Randall), who had the most acting experience, clearly relishes his role, but the real standout is Jack Purvis (Wally). His performance is the most powerful, and in the later scenes in particular he manages to convey so much emotion in the way he moves and the way he screws up is face.The cast is good all round in fact. Gilliam would frequently cast against type in his later work, and while that's not quite the case here there's an eclectic mix of cameos that creates some very unusual but brilliant characters. Although it's quite small, this is my favourite Sean Connery performance  he shows real warmth and fatherliness, and clearly took the role seriously in spite of it being a small part in a cheap film. Ian Holm and John Cleese vie for funniest role as Napoleon and Robin Hood respectively (by the way, for those who don't know, Cleese is basing his portrayal on Prince Phillip). And Time Bandits also ends centuries of theological debate by proving once and for all, that Ralph Richardson IS God.When I first saw this as a kid of about the same age as Kevin himself, I was really disappointed by the ending. It's not a sad ending as such, it just makes you go ""uh?"" In fact this is kind of a Gilliam trademark  plenty of his films end with the good guys technically winning, but with the hero ending up worse off. It's also an ending that is appropriate even though it's tough for kids to accept, because as much as anything else Time Bandits is about the end of childhood. Along his journey Kevin learns that sometimes heroes aren't all they're cracked up to be, and also that the most important thing in the adult world is money. Finally, he is abandoned and left to fend for himself  the comfortable world of childhood has gone.I'll also mention an interesting little fact about George Harrison's involvement in this film. As many people know, the ex-Beatle executive produced Time Bandits. He had various ideas about how the film should be made and frequently clashed with Gilliam. In the end, Gilliam managed to overrule him, and Harrison's only contribution to the finished product was writing the song that plays over the end credits. It's a great tune (Harrison was in my opinion the best songwriter in the Beatles), but as Gilliam points out in his commentary, the lyrics are actually nothing to do with the film. They are in fact an anti-Gilliam rant, something which the director himself only realised (to his amusement) after the picture was released.Time Bandits is a film about a child's imagination being set free  but it is really Gilliam's imagination that is being set free. It's the first time he really escapes from the shadow of Monty Python, and paved the way for future masterpieces.",Time Bandits
49,ShootingShark,"Waiter, More Champagne - And Plenty Of Ice !!",8,22 December 2007,"One night, six strange dwarfs tumble out of the wardrobe of Kevin, a schoolboy, and he follows them through a strange vortex which appears in his bedroom. The dwarfs have a map of space / time holes all over the world and are off seeking adventure, but are being followed by The Supreme Being, who wants his map back ...Terry Gilliam's first non-Monty Python movie, Jabberwocky, is good fun, but this one is the bee's knees. It's cracking good entertainment all the way through, with lots of lumpen bits of bloody history thrown together, a great sextet of reprobate dwarf actors, a brilliant guest star list (with Holm as Napoleon and Warner as the memorable Evil sharing the honours), hilarious knockabout scenes, bizarre characters, nightmarish horror moments and even social satire. Most of all, it looks sensational, belying its modest budget with amazing scenes as our heroes sail through a war-torn Italian town in 1795, dance at the mythic palace of Agamemnon in Mycenae, and hang suspended in the abyss at the Fortress Of Ultimate Darkness, all rendered in vivid detail. The wonderful visuals come from Gilliam's keen artist's eye, and the script (written by Gilliam and Palin) is chock-full of nutty ideas - an ogre's ship worn on the head of a much bigger ogre - and hilarious dialogue; just about everything Warner and Holm say is hysterical. It's also just a terrific story - Kevin is a normal kid who's scared, anxious, confused and bewildered, but is also intelligent and resourceful. I love the moment where he asks The Supreme Being why people had to die and we need to have evil in the world, and gets fobbed off with a lame, half-hearted philosophical answer. I also love the six little people in the cast, particularly Rappaport's egotistical bluster, Baker's happy-go-lucky charm and Edmonds' good-natured blockhead; after Napoleon's long drunken ramble on short guys in history, he replies, ""I'n't 'e interesting !"". Gilliam is an incredibly talented director, who for me is a unique mix of uncompromising auteur artist and self-deprecating clown, a sort of Stanley Kubrick meets Jacques Tati. This was the movie where he really hit his stride and it's endlessly rewarding viewing for the imaginatively-minded. Brilliantly shot by Peter Biziou with fine editing by Julian Doyle, and produced by George Harrison's Handmade Films - a great independent little film company which has made some real gems (The Long Good Friday, Withnail & I, Track 29) - this is a funny, scary, wonderful comic adventure unlike any other movie.",Time Bandits

51,Samiam3,????,6,25 April 2010,"Gee, I'm not quite sure what to make of Time Bandits, Is it fiction or fantasy, fairy tale or surrealism. I think it wants to be all of these, the result is messy, and not even that magical or mystical, but it has sporadic charm and humour, not enough though that I'd call it an ideal family film. If you want to be intrigued, Time Bandit may do the job, but children don't want to be intrigued, they want to be entertained. Terry Gilliam's black sense of humour, and satirical Italian theatrics may be bit much. The whole thing is just very weird.A boy in a middle class suburban British house hold. Wakes up in the middle of the night to fight a gang of Midgets in his room, he follows them across history, and ancient civilizations as they loot and pillage, from all sorts of treasures, and subsequently get into mischief. To do this, these little men use a time map, which they have stolen from their apparent master, and know they have evil forces chasing after them eager to get it. Terry Giliam has a great imagination but with the excaptio of the last couple, his movies are not as colourful as his illustrations. The sets are very bland in tone, unsaturated and look murky and fake, most of it looks like a movie set. The same can be said of Baron Munchausen made a few years later. Brazil was intentionally, grey and Bleak so I have no problem there, but this is an adventure movie. It should capture the imagination, by making us think we are in a different world. sometimes I think Gilliam wants to make a throwback to the days of Georges Melies (A trip to the moon). If this is the case, then one could say his success is controversial. It doesn't really benefit the movie, it only draws attention to itself.Time Bandits, is not completely devoid of life, It has moments of humour, and excitement. It is not actually all that disappointing a film, I kind of enjoy being confused by it, but it is a tricky film to recommend.",Time Bandits
52,davidmvining,History as escape,7,16 March 2020,"Terry Gilliam takes a more obvious break from Monty Python while still hiring John Cleese in a role. At least it doesn't star him. It's still a relatively disjointed experience, using the framework of time traveling robbers to justify looks into different times and places, letting Gilliam's visual imagination run rampant. It's really the justification behind most of his films, and here he finds his most solid footing yet. It could have been tighter, especially its first half hour, but it's still a fun children's adventure.Gilliam's films almost always deal with de-humanization, especially regarding the modern world. They're almost Kubrickian in their thematic focus. It's obvious here from the very start. Kevin and his family sit in their living room after dinner. Father and mother are mindlessly talking about kitchen appliances of their neighbors while watched a game show, but Kevin is in the background, endlessly engaged with a book on warfare in Ancient Greece. His parents seem like zombies in front of a modern piece of equipment talking about modern appliances while Kevin looks alive, engaged with a book talking about the ancient world. And therein is the movie in microcosm. Kevin yearns for an escape from the confines of his little house and little parents into the larger world, and his venue is history.In many Gilliam films, you could ask questions about what is actually happening, whether things are reality or fantasy, and I think that often simply misses the point Gilliam is trying to make. The delineation between fantasy and reality is a surface level question that is almost incidental to the actual journey the characters are going through. Fantasy is just the prism through which Gilliam sends these characters.In Time Bandits, it's the time travel that represents Kevin's escape from his humdrum modern life. That is made possible by the appearance of six dwarves (with a seventh only named for possible lawsuit reasons) who jump out of Kevin's wardrobe (an obvious link to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) with a map of the universe that pinpoints all of the holes in creation. They are on the run from the Supreme Being, having stolen the map from him, and before Kevin knows what's going on, his desire for escape is being thrust upon him as the dwarves push his bedroom wall outward into an endless hallway, chased by the Supreme Being in white spectral form. Suddenly, Kevin is in Austria several hundred years prior as Napoleon sacks Castiglione.It's here that the movie kind of gets lost a bit. The plots of the individual journeys into time feel like self-contained adventures rather than part of Kevin's overall arc, especially the first one with Napoleon. As entertaining Ian Holm is as Napoleon, obsessed with his height and loving the sight of little things hitting each other, Kevin gets lost in the hustle and bustle. It's about Napoleon and the dwarves' theft of his treasure so much that Kevin barely says anything. When they escape to the Middle Ages and meet an amusingly out of place Robin Hood, Kevin begins to reassert himself a bit, trying to leave the gang and join Robin Hood. It's also here where we are introduced to the antagonist of the film: Evil.David Warner as Evil might be my favorite part of the film. He enjoys his role so fully as the source of ultimate darkness, scheming his way out of his fortress by trying to steal the map that the dwarves themselves had stolen. He's dismissive, cool, and arrogant, all while wearing an intricate costume of skeletal parts and a flowing red cape.Kevin finally really gets his own story going when he separates from the gang and ends up in Ancient Greece with Agamemnon as his adopted father. Kevin has found a father figure who will treat him seriously, parent him well, all while Kevin is surrounded by the ancient world that captured his imagination in his books at home, but the gang finds him again and steels him away to the Titanic.It's on the Titanic that Randal, the head of the gang, informs Kevin of the most fabulous object in the world, hidden in the Time of Legends. Kevin is immediately dismissive of this idea. He's not concerned with things like his parents or like Randal and the gang, he was happy in the poverty of Ancient Greece with a father figure who seemed to actually love him. The Time of Legends brings us more typical Gilliam detours with an Ogre and his wife (which, again, are quite entertaining), but they are detours.When Kevin and the gang get to the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, we see Randal consumed by the greed for this unnamed fabulous object and the theft of the map in return. The finale is a big event where the gang goes through time holes to find support from different eras that all come and get ultimately destroyed by Evil, only for a nearly literal deus ex machina to appear in the form of the Supreme Being.So, the movie's ruthlessly paced with an over-eagerness to entertain, but it's not that settled into its own story to keep engagement quite as well as it could. My problems really are about the journey to Castiglione and the entrance to the Time of Legends as well as the sudden and unearned end to the conflict. The actual end of the movie, though, is another matter. I love that ending.After Kevin's adventure that may or may not have happened (it happened), his parents touch a piece of concentrated evil and explode, leaving Kevin alone in the world. He wanted escape from his humdrum life, he got a taste of it, and now he has it in full. His parents and all their materialism are gone. He now no longer has any excuse to do anything other than find his own way in the world. It's a shocking but ultimately hopeful ending. He's freed from the things that tied him down and can go on his own.It's messy just like Gilliam's imagination, but it's also infectious and fun. There's a wide-eyed optimism that mixes well with a steely-eyed cynicism, all told in the form of a children's story that challenges its audience and treats them intelligently.",Time Bandits
53,framptonhollis,Proof of Terry Gilliam's Genius,9,16 January 2016,"A lot of great fantasy films came out in the 80's. Among the best were films like ""The Neverending Story"", ""Labyrinth"", ""Legend"", ""Willow"", and, possibly the greatest (and most criminally underrated) of them all is Terry Gilliam's masterpiece ""Time Bandits"". It's a hilarious film that has a great cast, great directing, and a witty script!While it IS a fantasy film, it is much more than JUST a fantasy film. It is a Terry Gilliam film, a film full of insanity, magic, and a sharp satirical edge (any scene featuring the boy protagonist's technology obsessed parents is full of clever, and still quite relevant, satire).At times it's really dark (and creepy), at other it's really light, but it is always excellent and awesome! Jumping from one time period to the next, it manages to be a bizarre and creative treat almost unlike any other sci-fi/fantasy film (that wasn't directed by Mr. Gilliam, of course).It seems like a good prequel to Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" (which I'm really excited to see).",Time Bandits
54,lemon_magic,Gilliam's greatest film will rock your socks off...if you can get into his highly personal style,9,5 February 2006,"I absolutely love this film, but I can understand why someone else wouldn't care for it. ""Time Bandits"" essentially sets the stage for all the later Gilliam films. Costuming, fantastic sets, wildly creative and over-packed art direction, misanthropic viewpoint, Kafkaesque distrust and fear of authority and bureaucracy, wonderful throwaway gags with perfect comic timing, slapstick and menace,heroes with feet of clay...it's all here. In some ways, in fact, ""Time Bandits"" may be Gilliam's best realization of his vision, since in later movies (with the exception of ""Fisher King"") the overwhelming complexity of the production design and the sprawl of the screenplay can overtax the viewers' patience (as ""Brazil"" and ""Munchausen"" certainly did with me).In addition, someone unfamiliar with Gilliam's work who picks up a movie like this because of the ""Monty Python""/Holy Grail connection may be angered and disappointed to find that haw-haw-funny-funny Pythonesque whimsy and wordplay are at an absolute minimum here (although Python alumni Cleese, Palin, Jones and Idle often do show up in his films).But if you can get into it - this is a wonderful treat. It's like a trifle trimmed with cotton candy but laced with habanero pepper flakes that keep you on your toes. The young ""hero"" is the most believably bland and likable little boy in the world - imaginative, bright,resourceful and plucky, but somewhat shy and definitely clueless about the world he finds himself. He is easily bamboozled by the dwarven time travelers who drag him along for the ride. The characters he meets along the way are perfectly drawn and realized by the actors. There are too many great performances to detail, but I absolutely MUST mention David Warner's turn as ""Evil"", which is the highlight of the film for me. Impatient,petty, vindictive,seething with anger and irritation at his imprisonment, he is the very embodiment of every petty official, corporate executive, bureaucrat and dick-weed who takes the inconveniences and problems of life and other people as a personal insult. And he gets most of the best lines. ""Ahhh, Benson...you are so mercifully free of the ravages of intelligence."" ====Spoiler Below ========= After all this time, I still have a bit of a problem with the ending. The movie's implicit message is that Kevin is actually better off without his parents and that they would have eventually killed off the dreamer within him (and so the dream within him got them first). But Kevin obviously loved his Mom and Dad as any little boy would, and to deprive him at such a young and vulnerable age - and leave him on his own...after every thing he'd been through, and the courage (""pluck"", as the Brits would say) and intelligence he'd displayed at every step of his journey...he deserved better, and it still rankles me. But please note that I am still haunted by the fate of a fictional character, which may indicated how thoroughly ""Time Bandits"" engaged my imagination. This is a wonderful look into a fantastic realm. 25 years later, it still stands as a major work of art. If Gilliam never made another good movie, ""Time Bandits"" would still justify Gilliam's entire career.",Time Bandits

56,Beta_Gallinger,A humorous and chaotic fantasy adventure from Terry Gilliam,8,2 November 2009,"This is a film I clearly remember from my childhood, or at least I remember a lot of it. Right now, I'm familiar with Terry Gilliam as one of the members of the groundbreaking comedy team, Monty Python (the one who made the funny animations), and the director of several other movies, but when I first saw ""Time Bandits"", I was too young for a lot of that stuff. So, I saw this film long before I ever saw any of Gilliam's other projects, and long before I knew his name or anything about him. Twice in the past several years, I've watched this 1981 fantasy comedy adventure again on DVD, familiar with Gilliam and Monty Python by this time, and while I've never thought of it as an absolute masterpiece, it sure is entertaining.Kevin is a young history buff who lives with his neglectful, materialistic parents. One night, in his bedroom, he sees a knight on horseback come in through the wardrobe! The bedroom wall is gone, and in its place is a forest, which the knight disappears into! After this, everything goes back to normal! The following night, a mysterious group of dwarfs come out of Kevin's wardrobe, and are soon chased by the Supreme Being, who tells them to give back the map they have! The boy escapes with the dwarfs and finds himself falling into another place with them. He learns from the leader, Randall that they work for the Supreme Being, usually creating trees and bushes, but now they are using a map of time holes to steal treasure from different periods in history, and Kevin has joined them on their journey! Unbeknownst to them all, the Supreme Being is not the only one after them. The Evil Genius is watching them, and intends to get the map so he can take the Supreme Being's place and recreate the universe! The film doesn't go into much detail about Kevin and his life before the adventure, but it does clearly show what it's like in his household, and it's no surprise when he doesn't miss his parents on the journey. The film is often amusing around the beginning, but gets really funny when the dwarfs make their entrance. These characters are a major part of the humour, with their antics and conflict, plus such memorable lines as, ""Vermin, will you stop eating!"" Like several other Terry Gilliam films, other Pythons were involved in this one. Michael Palin co-wrote the story with Gilliam and played Vincent, and John Cleese played Robin Hood. These two are both memorable in their roles, especially Cleese, with what his character says to the dwarfs. David Warner also has really funny lines in the role of the Evil Genius, and comical things happen at his lair, especially with him and his dimwitted servant, Benson. There are too many great comic moments to mention, with Kevin and the thieves getting into so many situations on their adventure, in several different places and time periods. As well as humour, there's also some suspense, and some fascinating sets, especially the lair of the Evil Genius. Sean Connery in the straight role of King Agamemnon is another highlight.This is a rather bizarre movie, and a lot of people obviously wouldn't appreciate it for that, but what do you expect? It's from Terry Gilliam! Even though ""Time Bandits"" is in the family category, some might consider it too scary for kids, but that can happen. Personally, it didn't scare me as a kid, but everyone is different. I guess that's the risk you take with some movies. If kids can tolerate the dark moments (which I'm sure many of them can), they could enjoy this comic fantasy adventure, and obviously, many adults like it as well. It's not as popular certain other non-Monty Python movies from Gilliam (such as ""Brazil"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", which are indisputably not family movies, unlike this one), but despite how many critics it may have, it does have a well-deserved cult following. If you like Gilliam's demented style, this 1981 film of his is probably a good one for you to watch.",Time Bandits
57,phubbs,Time Bandits,5,26 February 2014,"Is Terry Gilliam riding on the coattails of Monty Python with this film? his cast does include a few Python members in small cameos and the films direction is most definitely bizarre. Not only that but the film looks and sounds like a Python sketch in various places much like 'Jabberwocky' did. Not complaining just pointing it out, love the film title though and those lovely looking opening credits.The first film in Gilliam's off the wall dream-like fantasy film trilogy where the plot basically revolves around escaping reality through imagination...or a dream. In this surreal adventure a young boy is zapped through time with the help of a bunch of dwarfs. This little team go around pinching loot trying to get rich with the aid of a map that shows them time holes to jump through time. On their tail is an evil sorcerer who wants the map for evil purposes and the maps owner the 'Supreme Being' (God?).The film starts off in a very simple manner that is quite enjoyable. Its very similar to the later Bill and Ted franchise as we jump to the Napoleonic Wars and meet Napoleon, then to England meeting up with Robin Hood and then to Greece meeting King Agamemnon. These few segments are good fun showcasing the films main big name cameos such as a rather dull Connery as Agamemnon, a very good Ian Holm as the height obsessed Napoleon and the brilliant Cleese as a rather stiff upper lipped Robin Hood and his cutthroat band of merry men. The Robin Hood sequence is easily the best with Cleese donning a daft over sized green Hood hat and typical clichéd Hood attire. He looks utterly ridiculous in his pantomime garb where as in contrast his men are a bunch of dirty filthy violent scum. The other funny angle is the fact Cleese speaks quite normally in his aloof aristocratic manner and his men don't, they are just your standard commoner oiks.Once we are introduced to the villainous 'Evil' (that's his name) who wants the map things kinda nose dive in my opinion. The dwarf team stop time jumping and instead go on the run from Evil but end up in Evil's realm and things just become all too weird. There are some nice moments that are typically Gilliam in visual style and idea, the galleon perched on top of the underwater giants head is a good one. No real clue what the hell was going on there, why the galleon is stuck to this giants head (it appeared to be his hat), why the giant was under the sea and who or what was in that little cottage before the giant crushed it??. Looked like some kind of elephant alien person, quirky little moment but totally off the wall, they just get killed then?.The entire final sequence where the dwarfs and little boy fight against Evil is just a mess really. This sorcerer is obviously pretty invincible yet the dwarfs conjure up all these pointless character from various time periods to fight him. I know its a young persons film but this battle is really quite hokey. Then in the end we meet the Supreme Being who turns out to be (or at least in human form) an elderly man in a suit who can't really act too well, nice concept though.I think the main thing that I disliked in this film was the little boy in the main role. This is an old film sure and the kid actor didn't have to be a great actor I admit but damn he's fudging annoying. His soft weedy whiny voice just grates the whole time and fails to give his character any impact at all, he always begs and pleads like a baby but you can hardly hear him half the time because he's so quiet...and wet. Am I being harsh? maybe, but this kid ruins the film, should of used a girl. The squad of dwarfs are the films main hook really...much like 'Willow'. None of them are particularly good actors but they are amusing and they do add to the fantasy charm. Seeing them all dressed up in their nifty warrior-like bandit outfits is kinda cool, clearly Gilliam (or someone) had this idea and knew they had to make a film around it.The film is essentially a kids flick, an imaginative adventure for young boys who like to play war, knights, cowboys etc...In that sense the film does its job and delivers a highly imaginative yarn no doubt. As an adult watching now the film doesn't quite hit the mark for me anymore, I guess the thrill has been left behind with age coupled with the fact the film doesn't really look very good anymore. It has dated quite badly in all honesty and the effects can be a bit dodgy. Like I said the first half set in the few time periods is good but after that it gets a bit rough around the edges. The very end feels too open ended also, definitely needed a more conclusive finish.In the end the film is a fun little ride with some nice visual ideas, but I can't help but feel without those few Python cameos this film wouldn't be half as much fun. You could say its only worth watching for the John Cleese sequence really...but that's just me.5.5/10",Time Bandits
58,DarthBill,"""I am the Supreme Being after all.""",8,17 September 2004,"Whacky, whacked out yet somewhat disappointing fantasy from the lone American Monty Python member, Terry Gilliam. A young British boy falls in with some thieving, time traveling dwarfs who are being chased by the Evil Genius (David Warner) and the Supreme Being/God (the late Ralph Richardson). Over the course of their adventures they meet Napoleon (Ian ""Bilbo Baggins"" Holm), Robin Hood (John Cleese, who would have been an ideal Little John) and King Agamemnon of the Greeks (Sean Connery) among others. Sound like fun? Well it is, sort of. Sometimes the film is very funny and even exciting, but at other times its just long, cumbersome and somewhat boring. There are some inspired bits and it is visually arresting, but it's never as funny or as exciting as it should be. Still, Ralph Richardson is funny as the Supreme Being.",Time Bandits
59,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Heavy on practical special effects and light on plot.,6,8 March 2019,"If there's one thing Terry Gilliam's films are known for, it's their imaginative visuals. In a time before CGI was prevalent, the practical and model effects certainly made his films distinctive, especially in the fantasy genre. That being said, one of his earliest films, Time Bandits (1981) was quickly outclassed, not only by Gilliam himself but by other films as well. While Time Bandits is a cute little story about traveling through time, it is precisely that: little story. Even with the spectacular visuals, the plot seemed to be quite lacking, almost as an afterthought to how many interesting set pieces could cram into one film.I will admit that Time Bandits was ahead of its time, but I wouldn't consider it better than films that came after it. If you want plenty of imaginative fantasy effects, look no further than Labyrinth (1986). A series of time-travel vignettes? Then Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989) is for you. A child's adventure in a fantasy world? Try The NeverEnding Story (1984). Sure, Time Bandits pre-dated all of them, but I don't think it necessarily influenced them directly since the 1980's was a bit of a golden age of these types of movies.In watching this film, I could tell the absurdity and sketch-comedy style of the Monty Python days remained in Gilliam's filmmaking. By 1985, and the brilliance that is Brazil (the correctly cut version, that is), Gilliam certainly began to show his development as a director. In the 1990's, he certainly hit his stride with such films as The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). As it stands, Time Bandits is a visually entertaining piece that shows the transition of Terry Gilliam's filmmaking from absurdist fantasy to a mind-bending social commentary.Heavy on practical special effects and light on plot, I give Time Bandits 3.0 stars out of 5.",Time Bandits
60,stamper,Genuine kiddie stuff,3,27 August 2000,"As I started watching this (only because I like Connery that much) I soon realised (after 20 minutes) that this is going to be a genuine kiddie fantasy picture that is just not made to be watched by someone like me who is already allowed to watch R - rated stuff. If you're older, stay away if you are from 1 to 7 and can read this, maybe you ought to watch this film once. If you are older beware, rather rent The Fisher King or Twelve Monkeys if you want to see a good Terry Gilliam movie.
You want to know why I turned it off? Well it has bad FX, a story that is not good (dwarfs steal a map from God with which they can travel through time???) and it is obvious from the beginning that this is not going to be anything special or thrilling. There might be a few good points here, but I'm not going to watch a 118 minute film just for some points of light and a movie that is actually below average most of the time.

Of course this film is not to be taken seriously, like any good Monty Python film, but this time Terry Gilliam did not an excellent work, as he did other times; at least in my point of view OK, the film is about fantasy, in measures that it even seems to be a movie for kids, but that's not the problem; the worst is that it's not as funny as I expected!

63,witster18,compelled to write a review about this childhood favorite of mine,9,1 December 2009,"At present, this film is rated 6.9 on IMDb. Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits deserves a far higher rating. This film has everything! The Time Bandits jump through a time hole and end up in the armoire of a young, bored kid who inadvertently joins them in their quest for riches.In the beginning of the film - Gilliam creates unbelievable thrills and sound effects that grab the audience and scare the kiddies. From there the group of misfits go on a wondrous journey through time, escaping evil, stealing, and hitching a ride on a giant. The sites and sounds steal the show, but it is the characters of evil, mainly Ralph Richardson as the Supreme Being, who oozes evil with a dash of comedic genius, and holds the film together in the palm of his hand, that makes this film fantastic.The movie has some strange qualities and settings that really set it apart. It starts in the future and ends in the future. There are many scenes where there seems to be no end to the madness(the hallway, the pit, the maze, the ending). The ending is absolutely wild - a battle for world domination.Gilliam had his pulse on what kids could take and understand, and yet he still pushed the envelope. The adults ask the questions while the kids enjoy the ride.As the fantasy moves along - the lead character, played by Craig Warnock, is faced with a series of tough questions. Even though he is younger in age than his smaller counterparts - Kevin eventually becomes a valuable member of the group. While on his quest to get home - he finds different places and people that have far more intrigue and understanding than his home-life. Before it's over the Bandits will have defeated evil and changed Kevin's life as he knew it.This is a quintessential fantasy. A diamond in a rough genre. Time Bandits may be impervious to time itself - a film that will always live dear in the hearts of those who experienced it as kids - yet still has mass appeal to new audiences.85/100You'll like it if you liked: Goonies(better) Brazil(better) Back to the Future(better), Hook(not quite as good but close)..

64,EijnarAmadeus,"Almost, the fourth Monty Python film.",6,9 November 2009,"Terry Gilliam mixes childlike adventurism and Monty Python oddity in his enjoyable TIME BANDITS, plotting the exceeding story of a gang of dwarfs who travels time stealing treasures. By accident they encounter the imaginative young boy Kevin (Craig Warnock), who being overlooked by his parents, joins the band and encounters the likes of Napoleon (Ian Holm), King Agamemnon (Sean Connery) and Robin Hood (John Cleese). The film's visualized by the dirty and organic production design that Gilliam fancies, the film has a somewhat extraneous narrative of episodic nature, and the many fanciful characters spices up the with 'brotherhood' enthusiasm. There's plenty of fresh ideas throughout, and they're always infused with the wacky, dark humor that defined the underbelly of Monty Python. Sadly though, it never gets all that funny, maybe it's because Gilliam, bearing the responsibilities of his own film, becomes too focused on the surreality, and so the best bits are drawn from fellow-writer Michael Palin? Still, the story is smashing and original, and I'll bet you'll be hard to find another film featuring dwarfs fighting a self-centered troll on a boat, which suddenly appears as the hat of a obese giant!

65,Igenlode Wordsmith,Cult that failed to recruit,5,1 January 2007,"I was very disappointed by this one. I suppose the definition of 'cult classic' is always going to depend on whether you turn out to be a member of the cult in question or not... which you can't know until you've tried. But the only reason I persevered through until the end was because I don't believe in slating a film unless I've actually seen the whole thing to make sure.To be fair, while I was pretty clear that I didn't like it somewhere around the Napoleon mark, there were a couple of scenes after that I did enjoy; but the whole thing is wildly uneven, with long sections I found boring and/or distasteful. The level of the special effects is wildly uneven as well, with a Minotaur whose head is so obviously a mask I assumed he was supposed to *be* a masked gladiator, and some of the most unconvincing expanded polystyrene slabs for smashing that I've ever witnessed. (Maybe they blew the whole budget on Mycenae?) While there is a trace of the famous relationship to Monty Python, the affinity turns out to be with the bits of Python I originally found unfunny -- what comes across as random cruelty and ugliness.My main problems with the film, however, apart from boredom, were the usual twofold pair: lack of empathy with the protagonists, to the extent that I actually felt a sense of relief when one of them looked like being killed (""One down, only half a dozen to go""), coupled with a resulting identification with the villain instead. Watching 'Evil' deflect the heroes' puny attacks with a wave of a hand, I'm afraid I felt a sense of warm achievement.Good points: Ralph Richardson, Sean Connery. Bad points: the insufferably annoying lovers (clearly I've lived much too sheltered a life to get the joke about the fruit), the endless Napoleon (all right, all right, we got the height obsession the first time), the bickering dwarfs, the leaden satire of the gadget-obsessed household, and every scene basically being milked far.... too... long.Clearly, either you like this film or you don't. If you like it, then the more the better. If you don't warm to the start, then there's no point staying the course in the hopes of improvement: what you see is what you'll get.

A misfit group of time travelers joined by a little boy bring to life eras in history with wonderful designs and detail. With cover art that is a brilliant mix of Dali and Kandinsky, Time Bandits is a film that has to be enjoyed at least once.Feeling increasingly more neglected by his technology-obsessed parents, Kevin (Craig Warnock) seeks solace alone, often tucked away in his room. One evening his room is crashed by a gang of misfit time travelers, international criminals (in training) who have stolen a map with all the time holes marked on it. These time holes will help them pop into a time period, steal whatever they wish, and jump into another time period before they can be caught. Along the way, Kevin runs into many of the people he has always read about in books during his alone time. Among those he meets are an endearing Robin Hood (John Cleese), the imposing King Agamemnon (Sean Connery), and the ever self- conscious Napoleon (Ian Holm). Traveling with his new troupe brings about some danger and not just in their missions alone. As it turns out, the gang is also constantly jumping away from the Supreme Being (Ralph Richardson) that they stole the map from in the first place. Time hopping was instrumental for Kevin to escape his ignored life at home, and finding just the right gang of misfits was more than he could ever imagine, and a group he didn't want to let go of.Time Bandits was a fun movie both for its plot, and production design. Each time in history that they jumped to was full of detail and thoroughly designed. I think of this movie as a good version of Forrest Gump.

70,Aylmer,"sporadically good, bizarre film",8,26 August 2004,"One of Gilliam's first non-Python films is extremely awkward in places, dull in others, but wildly imaginative all-round.  The best sequence has to do with a giant with a boat on his head - wonderfully surreal as is the final showdown with the evil genius.  It's just too bad that the rest of the film doesn't live up to it.  With the participation of half the old Monty Python gang, I would have expected it to have been a lot funnier than it is.  I think the only place that really got a good laugh out of me had to be the exploding dog - similar to the random exploding sheep bit in Peter Jackson's BAD TASTE.  Cleese and Palin turn in very brief, though memorable performances.  Connery is totally wasted along with most of the other top-billed stars.  It's really the gang of dwarves who get the most screentime and steal the whole show (though their motivation to ""get rich"" makes little sense as they seem to have little use for money).  The boy who plays Kevin is okay - definitely not as irritating as most child actors.Time Bandits works best for children with long attention spans, though there's a lot of it they'll want to FF through...  also the ending is a real eyebrow-raiser.",Time Bandits
71,beresfordjd,Why don't they get it?,9,25 October 2009,"This movie is brilliant and innovative. One has to remind oneself that it was made quite cheaply (though it does not look like it) and without the use of CGI. Only a director of real creativity and imagination with great technicians could have made this. I have found it gets better every time I see it and I have seen it many times over the years. It is an adventure, a sci-fi fantasy, an historical romp, a children's/family film, an adult-orientated satire and a Pythonesque comedy all at the same time. There was a post that said this film has no heart - I think that poster had no brain or imagination. Palin, Richardson, Duvall, Warner, Cleese and the lesser known members of the cast all turned in great performances. Wonderful direction and great writing make this movie a treat for anyone who loves movies. It is possibly the most creative movie ever made and one like it has never been accomplished. It matters not one jot how many times one sees it, there is always something else to pick up on. Gilliam is a genius and one of the most underrated and unsupported (financially) ever. Time Bandits is more than inventively made it is totally original.",Time Bandits
72,bat-5,Highly imaginative,8,30 May 1999,"Time Bandits benefits being sprung from the mind of Terry Gilliam.  His visuals fit the wild exploits of time travelling midgets whose main goal in life is to rob various historical figures.  John Cleese is a hoot as a very proper Robin Hood.  He comes off not as the dashing hero that the legend states, but more of a politician.  The highlight of the film is David Warner, who plays Evil very well.  Who knew that Evil was so touchy?  I especially like his ideas for starting the world over.  Gilliam's imagination is allowed to run wild in the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, where the final confrontation between good and Evil takes place, and where we are introduced to a very proper Supreme Being, who hates showing up in the form of a giant glowing head.  A very organized fellow who sees death as an escape from work.  Fun film to watch, just don't touch that thing in the toaster oven.  It might turn you into a hermit crab!",Time Bandits
73,lordzedd-3,A Monty Python's fan must see,8,9 June 2007,"Terry Gilliam of the Monty Python group directs this and Michael Palin helps him write the screenplay to this twisted time trip premise. Now the acting is perfect, the humor is dark but most of the time funny. The cast is wonderful and the story works. The effects are astounding, but my only two complaint is this. One, some of the humor is a little dark, I doubt Robin Hood's Merry Men were greasy thugs and the other is the climax. Without giving away too much it is on the confusing side. Also makes you wonder if it was all a dream or not. But as a whole Terry Gilliam does a great job directing and it is a must see for all the fans of the old Monty Python show of the 1960s. 8 STARS out of 10.",Time Bandits
74,charchuk,Childish but fun,8,17 April 2008,"Fun and inventive and often hilarious. You can tell that Gilliam's just having fun with this, though, and then he buckled down and made Brazil. There's a real sense of childishness and frothiness to the whole thing. I mean, what's it about really? There's some stuff about technology and bureaucracy ruining imagination (themes he expanded upon later on), but this is just a fun adventure flick.But it does that really well. The Python sense of humour works wonders with history (especially loved John Cleese as Robin Hood), and there's rarely a joke that doesn't work. Still, that long sequence with Agamemnon really drags and feels quite out of place. Connery is pretty wasted in what is, essentially, a straight role with no comedic partner to play off of. And the climax, while fun, is pretty silly.As far as Gilliam goes, you could certainly do worse, but this is far from the heights of Brazil or Twelve Monkeys, or even Holy Grail. Even so, it's not a throwaway, though it occasionally feels like one.",Time Bandits
75,InzyWimzy,Innocence of childhood,10,17 January 2004,"This is one movie for me that I can watch every time and enjoy.  Never get tired of it.Gilliam's early work has a very imaginative, quirky, strange, fantastical nature to it.  Similar to a child's imagination where the mind can form imaginary worlds of magic and excitement.  The trippy and surreal look definitely credits Terry's ability to capture his vision on film with simple, yet highly effective results.  The timeholes, the cage scene, the looks of different times seem like the real deal.  I can never forget the sound of shattering glass and the cracking of a skeleton's bones in an arid bleak desert setting after seeing this.  The cast is great from Kevin as our young, yet brave protagonist and his time traveling buddies.  Don't let appearances deceive you, these guys play their hearts out in this one. From the brash, yet effective leader Randall you my personal fave Wally played by late Jack Purvis.  I just love how Wally's emotions are so extreme whether it's being happy, grief, or rage (""You're MAD Randall!!!).  Jack seemed like a friend you'd go out with for a drink and have a jolly good time.  Of course, Fidgit, Og (OINK!), Strutter, and Vermin who's has got a mad case of the munchies!  Then, the baddies led by David Warner who wonderfully leads his 'Yes' men from the dark underworld.  Just don't get Evil ticked off or ZAP!  Add cameos from John Cleese, Mike Palin, Shelly Duvall and not to mention Sean Connery and this one has your attention from start to finish.Gilliam and Palin show that a children's story doesn't have to be cutesy and sugar coated.  Like most of Gilliam's work, he allows you to watch his films and draw your own inferences and opinions; movies that don't take the viewer's intelligence for granted.  Being open minded and accepting it for what it is makes watching Gilliam's movies a pleasure that never gets old.",Time Bandits

You can see the Python influence all over it, although there are bits where it calms down and we see a more tender side of things. The performances were all excellent with Craig Warnock and David Rappaport taking star billing (for me). Oh and look out for a recurring gag featuring Michael Palin and Shelley Duvall, very funny. If there is a down side, it's that it's a little too long and the bickering between the dwarfs does get a little tedious after a while.

78,dkncd,Eccentric adventures in history and fantasy,9,29 September 2007,"""Time Bandits"" is the story of a young boy named Kevin who becomes entangled with a group of dwarfs that travels through time to loot treasure. This film is directed by Terry Gilliam and co-written by him and Michael Palin, both of Monty Python fame. Given that, it's not surprising that the film takes a humorous approach to history and fantasy.Craig Warnock gives a fine performance as Kevin and the dwarfs are all well-portrayed. This film certainly derives a lot of strength from its casting, and my favorite performances come from John Cleese as a patronizing foppish Robin Hood, David Warner as an evil genius who revels in being malicious and Ralph Richardson as a pretentious ""Supreme Being"". Also notable are Ian Holm as an exceedingly insecure Napoleon and Sean Connery as King Agamemnon.While this didn't seem as funny as some of Terry Gilliam's other efforts, the laughs were quite consistent throughout the film. There are also some great moments of tension developed, particularly toward the end. Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin have succeeded here in creating a humorous look at different historical figures and fantasy settings.",Time Bandits
79,enochsneed,Awkward mix of Monty Python and grotesque fantasy,6,21 November 2012,"There is a lot that is impressive about this film. It has a very high calibre cast, very good production values and excellent special effects. The problem for me is the script. The different elements that are brought into play don't make a coherent whole. We have satire at the expense of the gadget obsessed middle-classes, Monty Python-style silliness (the Robin Hood and Titanic episodes), historic epic (the ancient Greece of Agamemnon) and grotesque fantasy sequences. These are all brought together in a rather over-long and violent climax but this still doesn't round the film off satisfactorily.The best thing about the film for me is Ralph Richardson's Supreme Being: God as a slightly vague (he thinks creating Evil had ""something to do with free will"") management figure in a tweed suit is somehow more fitting to the real world than a booming-voiced Charlton Heston type with a big beard.",Time Bandits

His lines are memorable, for indeed, why should a Supreme Being create such an abominable creature as a slug? The Devil just wants a perfect world and he gets hilarious when he says just how (e.g. digital telephones for everyone, fiberoptic telecommunications, etc.) This should remind us of older religious traditions' belief in a Malevolent Being that began existence as a partner of God in creation (cf. Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, etc.) Apparently, the two had some disagreements on just what the fabric of the universe should be, hence the parting of ways. This also brings to mind Carl Anderrson in his role as Judas in Jesus Christ, Superstar when he asked why the Messiah chose that wretched time in that forsaken land to deliver his message. Jesus should have come in the 20th century with the spread of mass communication. Rantings by the characters played both by Warner and Anderrson are obviously false and yet so much fun and funny.My two little boys enjoyed the film and to my surprise, so did I.",Time Bandits

I always loved ""Brazil"" and this was a precursor to that film with the same surreal feel and strange effects (though with a lower budget). The story moved fairly quickly but the paucity of humour meant the film lacked real sparkle. Most of the performances were good notably Cleese, Connery and Rappaport, but Palin and Duvall were annoying, Duvall especially as she seemed to go overboard to impress us with her english accent.

83,rdukeesq,one of gilliam's best,8,26 June 2011,"So I watched ""time bandits"" from 1981 and directed by the great Terry Gilliam. So is it a classic, well yes but just possibly of the cult variety. Time bandits represents Gilliam's more playful side, a side that is directed at making kid's fairy tales. Other examples of this side include ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and ""the brothers Grimm"". This film is his most successful attempt at making a kid's movie. However, this movie is not just for kids, I do remember making my dad take me to this when I was just 7. However, I have seen this movie at various points in my life and it held up at every stop, including this latest viewing. This film is a child's dream come true (or is it). It is strange at times, while making subtle statements on modern suburban life at other times. Statements that I may add still hold up today. The story centers around the adventures of a young boy, well played by Craig Warnock (this was one of the few things he did as an actor), as he joins a rag tag bunch of little people who work for the supreme being. These pint size creative assistants are hell bent on making a name for themselves as robbers. The first thing they steal is the supreme beings map of time portals allowing them to time travel and well become ""time bandits."" From there the movie is a mythical adventure partly based on historical figures and partly based on fairy tales. This movie is hilarious, it is stylistically a good example of the unique genius of Terry Gilliam, and has several cameos of great actors including Sean Connery. The one thing that is up for debate is was this a dream, was it real, or was it a dream so powerful it became real. I lean toward the last theory, just look for giant ""leg-gos"" and the last shot of the boys bedroom, to understand part of my justification for subscribing to this last theory. The end is odd and leaves many unresolved questions, but that is part of the beauty of this great film. This movie is not for everyone, it is for the indy lovers, the more creative among us, and the little kids who grow up and don't necessarily score with the head cheer leader. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Time Bandits

Ian Holm is a Napoleon sensitive about his height.  John Cleese is a terrible polite Robin Hood. Sean Connery is a straightforwardly heroic Agamemnon.  Peter Vaughan is a disgusting ogre.  The whole thing makes an absolute mockery of any kind of theology and is miles better than the director's later Adventures Of Baron Munchausen, which has a similar structure, and which I also like.

86,jonathandoe_se7en,Gilliam's dreamer Trilogy: Part 1,7,23 September 2001,"This was the first part of former Monty Python member Terry Gilliam's dreamer trilogy, a set of films that looked at a similar male character, lost in their own little world, trying not to get crushed by the system. Time Bandits is probably the least successful of the three, possibly because there is still a strong air of Python about it. Now I like Monty Python, but that style of comedy just does not gel with this kind of film.Time Bandits is all about Kevin (Craig Warnock), a young dreamer trapped in a dull suburban life. It's only when a group of time travelling little people emerge from his wardrobe with a map stolen from god that the film really takes off. Now, that's all well and good, but the problem with Time Bandits is that two much of the film is inconsistent, Gilliam's imaginations just runs wild and the story goes from one extreme to another.There is also way too many celebrity cameos, John Cleese as Robin Hood, Ian Holm as Napoleon, Michael Palin and Shelly Duvall turn up twice. And then there's Sean Connery, who has a lengthy scene in the middle of the films as King Agamemnon. Even if it does pull it's self together in the end, the film is still flawed bacause of this.Also, for a family film, Time Bandits is unbelievably dark; with a downbeat ending to rival that Gilliam's follow up Brazil (1985). Still, it's worth watching as a great comedy/fantasy, but much like me, you'll love it when you're about ten, but as you grow up a lot of the film's power will be lost.

But he wakes up to find himself in another world where he is guided around by a group of dwarfs! His adventure then begins. They travel to different worlds and come across all sorts of different enviroment's and life forms. They also travel back in time to the Roman era and other historical events.The ending to this movie is pretty un-predictable, with some unusual twists.It's surprising to see John Cleese and Sean Connery in this movie. I tend to think this was one of Connery's poorer roles in a movie.But this movie does have a lot of action in it. It's more of a children's magical fairy tale kind of movie.

Later you find out the six helped God create the world. Kevin joins him on their journey away from The Supreme Being.

Ex-Beatle George Harrison also was one of the executive producers.To me though when re-watching this film I find that Sean Connery alone grounds this film.

I liked the variety of personalities among the main characters. I liked Robin Hood's hat. I like the silly debate over whether this is a children's movie (since it has a child in a lead role) or an adult's movie (because of the occasionally dark touches); I suspect Gilliam probably loves the debate.My respect for Sean Connery went up in this movie. In the scene with the disappearing act, Agamemnon suddenly realizes that something is wrong and stands up. When I saw this in the theater, I was struck by Connery's commanding presence as realization hit and he stood up with regal indignation and concern; he conveyed a lot through a relatively simple action. When I see this on the small screen, perhaps worsened by the non-letterbox format, the effect is lost, and all you see is that Agamemnon stands up. But in the theatre, it was a good scene.Great fun.

I watched it again recently, and—as you'd expect from someone as meticulous about detail as Gilliam—it holds up extremely well. This may also be due to the fact that the effects had to be achieved practically. Of course, real effects always look more real than digital effects.This time round, as an adult, the influence of ""The Wizard of Oz"" was more apparent, and I believe it deserves to be classed alongside that epic fantasy. Time travel was always fascinating as a kid, and the film definitely struck a chord with my daughter. There are brilliant supporting roles and cameos from some of the greatest British actors and comedians. And I forgot just how funny the script was, steeped in Monty Python's dark, satirical humour. It's very sad to me that, because of the changing nature of film financing and increasing reliance on digital effects, films like this don't get made anymore.

98,Pigbelly,One the best films of its kind,10,25 March 2007,"To make a film that is both fantastical and intelligent is a difficult task. This was especially difficult at the time TIME BANDITS was made as the tools of the special effects trade were rather minimal and crude. Many films of this era that manage to succeed at the fantastical part are rather stupid films (STAR WARS and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are two of them). Many people feel that STAR WARS and its ilk are good films but they are not. They are dull and stupid stories with poor acting and ridiculous dialog. TIME BANDITS succeeds at being a highly intelligent, creative and a very entertaining film by masterfully using the special effects of the time to surpass anything (except possibly BLADERUNNER)in its execution of the fantastical. I am old enough to have seen all the STAR WARS films as well as TIME BANDITS in the theater when they were released and as a young adult I was far more impressed by TIME BANDITS than any of the STAR WARS films. Actually, I found the original STAR WARS film rather boring. The problem with STAR WARS is that it is a children's story trying to be young adult entertainment and it comes across as very awkward, immature and childish. TIME BANDITS, however, has set its target audience (like many Warner Bros. cartoons before it) squarely at children but does not talk down to them and therefore succeeds at creating a story that entertains children as well as adults. TIME BANDITS is a masterpiece of science fiction and children's cinema and should bless everyone's DVD collection. It is such a great, great film.",Time Bandits
99,constructionbob,"Masterful fantasy, in the purest form",9,27 July 2000,"Finding Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits"" in the bargain bin at the local movie store was too good a deal for me to pass up, and I'm so glad I didn't!  This movie is probably one of the greatest modern-day fantasies I've seen, due primarily to the amazing vision of Gilliam.  I was disappointed with it on my first viewing years ago, expecting a rehash of Monty Python material, but yesterday watching it I just couldn't stop grinning.  This movie knows its sources, and sends them up right.For starters, I love how Gilliam handled the boy 'hero' in ""Bandits"".  He's not anyone spectacular, aside from an active imagination (over and above his banal parents), and he really doesn't contribute much to the story-it simply passes him by.  Most of the other characters don't like him that much even. (the ""stinking Kevin"" line just makes me howl!) He's also not that cute, which is a rarity with child actors and which sinks most films with them. Plus, the danger of the story doesn't stop at him, as shown by the rather sobering finale.  No 'It's all a dream' type cop-out here.  Having studied the form of the fantasy as explained by Tolkien myself, Gilliam obviously understands how it works.Of course, because it works, ""Time Bandits"" is just plain fun.  The plot's out of nowhere-just kind of trips along through time and space and stranger things.  Napoleon as a height-obsessed drunkard?  Robin Hood as the aloof, unlikely leader of a band of violent, too-merry men?  Agamemnon as the ideal father figure?  It's all here, plus the technocratic, pyromaniac ""Evil"" vs. the Supreme Being.  Ah, you always knew He was an staid Englishman in a pinstripe suit, didn't you?  (""Dead?  No excuse for laying off work."")Perhaps it's not Gilliam's masterpiece, as ""Brazil"" could be argued for that...though one could also argue ""Time Bandits"" gives a bleaker perspective through the contrast of the fun and whimsy.

101,sherbetsaucers,My Gosh But It Looks Splendid!,7,7 March 2007,"Long before Kevin Costner became Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, John Cleese gave us Robin Hood, Prince of Wales. Greeting people like a royal dignitary and handing out goods to the poor (""Oh you must meet them. I'm sure you'll like them. Of course they haven't got two pennies to rub together but that's because they're poor."") and then looking a little confused as one of his merry men punches said peasant in the face, Cleese's insane take on Hood would seem out of place in most movies. But not in Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits The story is at once complex and really very simple. Simple in so far as it is just a coming of age story. Complex because it involves time travel, fantastical elements and even the concept of Evil itself. In summary, the plot involves Kevin (Craig Warnock) entering a portal through time and space due to the fact that 6 dwarfs appear in his bedroom, and rather than face the big scary head that is chasing them, he decides to join them. The big scary head turns out to be that of the supreme being and the dwarfs turn out to be his assistants. They have taken a map showing all of the holes in the universe, and using this valuable artefact, have decided to make their fortune. Kevin, who frankly is ignored by his gadget-obsessed Mum and Dad, is happy to go along with the insanity, which leads him from Napoleonic Italy, to Ancient Greece, from Medieval England to the deck of the Titanic. Yet all of this fun comes at a cost. The group are tricked into going to 'The Time Of Legends' by Evil (David Warner), who wishes to steal the map and recreate the world in his own image: a modern world, without useless things such as butterflies and daffodils. Luckily in the end all is set to right, apart from the fact that Kevin's parents are both killed in front of him in a horrific fashion and his home and almost everything he owns is burnt to a crisp. Still, mustn't grumble Considering that it is written by two former Pythons it is not surprising that this film is of both the zany and the funny ilk. It is also really rather dark, with a large number of brutal deaths occurring on screen, as well as some adult concepts. Just because it is a comedy fantasy, do not be fooled into thinking it is designed for children. While it has a PG rating I think that this movie is more enjoyable to people over the age of 12, simply because many of the ideas within the movie are intellectually abstract.At times watching this movie is much like watching one of Gilliam's animated interludes come to life. A giants foot coming down on a hut while we hear a couple bicker, the fantastic settings of Evil's lair, and even the slightly surreal home of Kevin and his parents, remind us of the slightly skewed vision of the director. However skewed it may be it is, ultimately, compelling viewing.Does it really happen or is it all in the mind of Kevin? Frankly there are arguments for both ideas. All of the places visited can be seen around Kevin's bedroom. From the obvious pictures of Napoleonic armies and the tank seen at the end of the movie to the less obvious Lego model that becomes Evil's domain. Also Kevin is clearly a child with great imagination and very little outlet, with two ghastly parents living in a shrink-wrapped sofa world. On the other hand, after all of his adventures are over and he has returned to normality, there are still photos of his adventures in his knapsack. So, who is to say if it was all a dream or not? Certainly not me. And, frankly, it doesn't matter either way.On a personal note this review has been a hard one for me to write so far. Not because I don't like this movie - I do - but because I don't actually know what to say about it. Like many movies of Gilliam's it is the visual splendour that leaves its mark and there are really only so many times I can say that things do really look rather splendid.",Time Bandits

I think I probably would have gotten a kick out of this as a kid as well.7/10************SPOILERS************Recommended for those that enjoy closet horse, giant floating heads, man-pig hybrids, really big people, really small people, exploding people, puppet shows, recounts of historical figures heights, kitchen appliances, chiropractic readjustments, nautical headwear......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once",Time Bandits

They end up traveling to different time periods and get to meet people such as Napoleon, Robin Hood, and even someone who resembles the devil. This movie shows you different sides of each character and the problems they have. Time Bandits was a fun movie to watch. This movie reminds me of other 80's fantasy movies where even if the movie is only rated PG there could be some parts that may be a little scary for younger children.People have mentioned they were planning to remake this movie into a series of kids movies. I don't know why anyone would want to remake this movie into a series of kids movies. This was a fun movie to watch.

I was 7 years old. British kids + midgets = a winning combination.Watching the film as an adult, I can clearly see the Monty Python connection, but back then, I had no idea that Terry Gilliam was a cohort of the MP gang. I just loved the George Harrison theme song, and the wild adventures a quiet, imaginative boy, like myself, could get into.Certain things escaped me then, ""Pansy! The problem! I must have fruit!"" Now I know what they were talking about! The action was great the cameo by Sean Connery was superb. Having recently seen Alien, watching Ian Holm as Napoleon was a trip.Stands up well even today.

107,clurge-2,"To this Python fan, it was an enormous let down...",5,20 August 2000,"I am probably one of the largest Monty Python fans of all time. From the original BBC series, to the feature films, to the audio recordings, I enjoyed them all. I knew Time Bandits had a few Python graduates in it, yet I never sat down to watch it. When I did, I'll honestly say that it was quite a let down.The film had it's strong points, no denying it that, but I think my expectations were set too high since the Python reputation succeeded it. Plus, I was never a fan of any fantasy-esque kid flicks of the 80s when I was a child, like Labyrnth or The Neverending Story. Time Bandits followed the same common pattern, more or less. Many rave about this film, and it has somewhat of a cult following, but I'm just not charter member I suppose.The roles of Cleese and Palin were limited, Cleese to about five minutes of screen time, and Palin to about ten. Sure they shine, as always, but they had no room to move about, or steal a scene like they normally would. Time Bandits was imaginative, and thought provoking, but there is only so much you can do when an 8-year-old child is one of the heroes. Imagine the film if geared for adults (say, putting a Gilliam ""12 Monkeys"" spin on it)...then it would constitute as being truly amazing. A great movie to watch with your kids, but not one for Python fans to sit around and view. Go get Quest For The Holy Grail instead.",Time Bandits
108,HUXLEYedwards,the crushing exit,10,22 June 2008,"This would have been a very defining experience, in my life, of movies watched in the theatre. I remember seeing the original ad in the Paper for it, the design itself sucking me in, i was 8 years old at the time and was just so excited, then the commercials hit and I HAD to see this movie.I don't remember how much convincing this took to see, but we went as a family to see it, my mom, step dad, and my siblings. As I recall, i was the only one looking forward to seeing this movie.I say ""would have been"" a great experience, because probably 15 minutes into the movie, my parents were groaning and just generally unsettled with the content it the film and decided to pack up and walk out, forcing me along with them. I was pretty much in shock and probably cried.This was repeated with the movie the Dark Crystal, and I'm pretty sure Krull too.Fortunately I got to see all of the Star Wars movies in their entirety and Indiana Jones, among other movies.As soon as Time Bandits was released on Video Cassette, I jumped at the opportunity to watch it, and my friend Jason and I watched it over and over, it was an at home experience that was one of the earliest VHS viewings, and one I honor as being fabulous. Oh, I watched it on Selectavision too!!! Total utter classic. Genius overflowing in the premise and it's great Terry had such an opportunity.

All of us hated it with a passion. It's a nice enough kids' movie, maybe in the year it came out. However, think about it: an outdated kids' movie? What's the point? Kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway, and I don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all.Some kids' movies (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed even now, but Time Bandits is totally outdated. For your reference, and I think applicable in this case, I also did not like Dr Strangelove or Spinal Tap at all. So, if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies, you might like Time Bandits.There is also a horrible case of overacting as I recall from the 'bad guys'. Think of the two stupid 'bad pirates' in the Pirates of the C. movies, except in Time Bandits they are not even remotely funny.Anyway, I warned you, that's all I can do.

The other film of course is time bandits. Its not after the film I remember it was before, first picking it up at the library and taking it home.  I remember watching the film and thinking how wonderful it was.  To my Time Bandits is the greatest fairy tail of all, although as an adult it has become a greatest of dark comedy.  The most important thing of this film though was the change it had on my life.

113,SteveM-1,"Disturbing film, especially for children.",2,4 July 2018,"I first saw this film when I was 10 years old. My Dad took me to see it as I thought it looked fun and since it was PG and had a kid in it who was approximately the same age, it was assumed to be a children's movie. Not quite. I know the Pg-13 rating had not been devised yet when this film was released, but if it had been, I think this film certainly should have earned it. To me and my 10 year old mind, it just had a lot of disturbing images. It was mild at first as the child was obviously being neglected by his parents and they watched a TV show where contestants in a game show had to undergo somewhat harsh and disturbing tasks just to win some household appliances. I'm sure it's supposed to be a clever satire on consumerism, but a 10 year old doesn't know that. After that, it was downhill. Little people eating rats, a man losing his arm in an arm wrestling match, exploding people and exploding dogs were just a few of the items that bothered me at that time. I learned much later that Terry Gilliam is known for having a Black sense of humor, but I didn't know it at the time. Not to spoil the ending, but it was also disturbing and un-satisfying to see what Kevin was left with by the end of the picture. I'm not saying the film should be banned or edited or whatever. It's an OK film for adults and mature teens. Just not for young children as the PG rating is a little mis-leading. I still find Terry Gilliam's sense of humor to be a little off-putting, but if you enjoy that, it's fine.

However, it lacks a bit in execution. The story is very episodic, and it's hard sometimes to stay with it. The band of bandits is actually kind of unlikeable sometimes, and the kid isn't exactly the most proactive protagonist.As a kid, though, I totally adored this movie. It was really really fun. it still holds some of that magic and wonder, and there are so many exotic locations and characters that if you get bored with one, don't worry another will be right around the corner. However likewise if you are enjoying one period, you don't get to be there for very long.

123,nbubacz,Brilliant,8,29 March 2006,"Time Bandits is a brilliant film. It plays with the downtrodden, British humorist view of life. Gilliam is a genius, I just don't always like his stuff. Time Bandits, like Brazil, is the very best of his stuff. The hero is a rather naive boy living in a world that offers him only bored continuity. Then the dwarfs fall into his room and spirit him away on this fantastic journey. The dwarfs are anti-heroes themselves, driven by greed. The play between God and Satan here shows remarkable understanding of just who they are according to Gilliam's interpretation of the Bible. Good, played by a fine, aged English gentleman, states evil must exist because it offhandedly has something to do with freewill. Evil on the other hand convinces himself he is not enslaved, or destined to lose, but in fact, he is just setting up the moment for him to be victorious. He also refuses to be counted as a created being, he has convinced himself he is an equal to God, and in fact, more worthy of God's position due to his intellect and intent. Which is all in fact his arrogance, which started his rebellious trouble in the first place. Almost all the characters are dubious, depressed, failures, or those trying hard but just not able to completely win out the internal/external battle of being good but having an evil nature. The character played in the best light outside of Kevin is Connery's Agememnon. Yet right before the scene of him adopting Kevin he is ordering summary executions. I saw this as a child in the theaters. It fascinated me then for its fantasy and imagery. I see it now as an adult, in the same light but with an appreciation of the brilliance of Gilliams commentary on the natural and supernatural world. I just don't always agree with him.

133,georgejamesgatwick,Good but not Great,7,27 January 2009,"""Time Bandits"" is a fantasy film that is really fun from a lot of the people behind one of the greatest TV comedies/film comedy teams, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"". I've seen it many times since I first saw it in college about ten years ago, and still really enjoy the fantasy aspects of the movie. It is really well done but the movie just has a few too many down points and holes to be quite as good as it could be. I would compare it to Terry Gilliam's later movie ""The Adventures of Baron von Munchausen"" because they are both fantasies that are very creative but for some reason not quite as good as they could/should be. Highlights in the movie include the cameo by John Cleese (Monty Python again!) and Sean Connery also has a good cameo. The story is about Time Bandits who use a map of the universe to travel through time and space to try to find lost treasure, and the story is suitable for almost anyone (I'd say kids 12 and older are old enough to appreciate the story).",Time Bandits
134,solar_son,"""REEEETURN THE MAP!!""",9,22 July 2002,"One of my all-time favorite films from childhood, Time Bandits remains timeless (pardon the pun)!  This entire picture just emanates fun, quirkiness, and fantasy - while still managing to be intelligent and very witty.  In fact, I have trouble even categorizing Time Bandits into a film genre.  While not being the greatest or most coherent movie of all time, it remains one of the most memorable. Based on the most timeless and ongoing good-vs-evil struggle:  God vs. The Devil (or Supreme Being vs. Evil Genius in this case), Time Bandits moves all over in and out of reality mixing fact and fiction. (*Minor Spoiler*) We're even left in the end to come up with our own conclusions about what happened, further proof that to watch this movie you need a good imagination and a strange sense of humor!If you're too nitpicky and have forgotten how to just relax and enjoy a fun movie then this may not be for you.  For those of us with the runaway imaginations and an ""off the wall"" outlook on life - this is it right here!I have just picked up this movie on DVD and can't wait to show my kids one day - hopefully before they become spoiled by $100 million CGI special effects, bland story lines, and characters without heart.",Time Bandits
135,Krapnov,An entertaining fantasy piece... Or an insightful movie you'll feel like sharing then TALK about it ?,10,29 January 2011,"I think the magical key phrase for truly enjoying this movie can be resumed simply in 'WHAT IF'...It is my personal belief that Mr. Gilliam beside managing to weave a visually convincing and entertaining children fairytale (one that still appeal to kids 30 years after it was made), also managed to raise a serious questioning in both the young and the adult viewer (in most of them I do hope) about the way we see the world around us.A younger (or simply disinterested) audience would while following the story, somewhat 'fill' the darker more adult oriented undertone portions of it with something familiar. What is hinted AT but left unsaid on screen is then resolved in a conventional fairytale fashion and it remain at that, a Tale... One that involve midgets in a fantastic setting doing wacky things like 'swimming' or riding a tank that shoot lasers in Legoland.But there is much more going on there, and that's where the 'Pythonesque' experience is to be found. (A bit of a comparison could be drawn here with 'Edward Scissorhands' from the work of Mr.Burton before he stopped being relevant).There's that ONE moment where you should stop to think, 'Yeah but what if?'For the characters portrayed on screen, the events unfolding represent their 'Reality'... Why should this be interpreted differently because its presented as a 'Tale' to the viewer?Are Kevin's new friends 'simply' lacking strong moral values for the way the story resolve itself BECAUSE they are to be portrayed as 'thieves'??Is what some people might refer as 'overacting' simply not loud *HINT HINT* ""What is happening is not to be interpreted literally"" ??.Wasn't the Legal System (encompassing Law, Currency & Government) the very fabric of which bind our modern society together conceived by the same minds that simultaneously wrote the 'Iliad' and made sacrifices to Gods?This is precisely where Terry Gilliam shine, subtlety.HE and few others are timeless reminders of why CINEMA can occasionally be ART instead of simple mass 'entertainment'. As so, applying a rating to a 'somewhat visually dated children story' is entirely subjective to whether or not it made you think 'around the edge' afterward.",Time Bandits
136,foufie,hilarious but unfortunately not all along,7,11 December 2001,"Terry Gilliam and a few of the old Monty Python cast (John Cleese and Michael Palin), this sounded like a great chance to have a few laughs... and it was but after having seen the Life of Brian or Brazil I guess we just have to be at least a bit disappointed by TG's other movies : the man is a genius but still has his ups and downs... let's just say the movie stems from a good idea and has excellent bits but it gets a bit boring at times, still I recommend it, but don't expect too much of it.",Time Bandits
137,PhxDwn,"Not the best Gilliam film, but his brilliance is present.",7,1 August 2021,"Terry Gilliam's striking imagery, masterful use of the wide angle lens, distinct camera angles, and his unique sense of humor (finely honed during his days with Monty Python) can all be found in Time Bandits. These elements are why Gilliam is one of my favorite filmmakers. There is no one else like him. I feel he vastly improved with his later films, but Time Bandits is still a spectacular experience.A particular thing about Time Bandits that impresses me is the toys and pictures seen in Kevin's room at the beginning of the film are all represented with their real-life counterparts in later scenes. It's a brilliant touch. It's part of the movie's over-all theme of an imaginative boy, starved for attention due to his loveless, neglectful parents, who goes on an adventure through time. Did it really happen, or was it all just inventions of his imagination? The answer is not needed, but the question it raises is a touch of great filmmaking.Also, Time Bandits should be commended for being the first, and one of the only, films to show little people as real people. They are historically exploited or stuck in silly costumes throughout entire movies, but here, they are given the chance to really act, and not be treated as glorified props. I hope Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones fame holds great respect to Time Bandits, and acknowledges the doors this movie opened for little people in the entertainment industry.I give Time Bandits a 7 out of 10. It's a good movie, but it doesn't reach the greatness that he later achieved with Brazil, Munchhausen, the Fisher King, and Twelve Monkeys. Still, for those who haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a watch.One final note: most of the camera angles in Time Bandits are low. A perfect touch, considering the small stature of all the lead characters. Many filmmakers forget this with movies told from a child's perspective.",Time Bandits

There are many funny moments here, but this is mostly a fantasy film. I think this is the kind of movie that kids would adore because the imagination here is amazing. First things first, this is a Terry Gilliam movie, don't expect anything normal. There is time travel, a band of thieving dwarfs, a very memorable villain, the Titanic, and Sean Connery. There are plenty of thrilling moments here. The set design in incredible, its amazing how much work went into this film. Every character is memorable. You'll become very attached to the main character and the band of dwarfs. For me, the film was almost perfect, except for the divisive ending.

Certain parts really dragged out for far too long... The scenes with Robin Hood and the ""Evil"" were great but I have to say that the Napoleon and Agamemnon parts left much to be desired (there seemed to be a lot of uncomfortable silences  of course this may have been intentional but it nonetheless led to some awkward moments...) Also, why was everybody speaking English? That was a bit puzzling but I guess it made for an easier transition to the movie screenIn conclusion, the movie was worth seeing if only for the ""jolly good"" Robin Hood scene... :)",Time Bandits

Then as it gets to the end, just WHO is the ""Supreme Being"" we've heard so much about? He's a 70year-old white guy in a suit, as if he's just come in from a day at the office. He then orders the dwarfs around like you would expect from an overbearing boss/father figure. I don't know about you, but I would never let my kids watch a movie where summary execution is a backdrop between comedy & father/son themes...something a little strange about that.

142,alexandre_rdc,wonderful imagination,9,1 May 2007,"The best in this film is the visual and the imagination of the writers. I like very much the kind of humour of Terry Gilliam, he kept this in this film and it's hilarious. The cast is great, personally, I like very much to watch Shelley Duvall, Sean Conery, Michael Palin, etc. This film is a celebration of imagination although, the experience of the boy was real, he was not dreaming, the photos and the disappearance of his parents. He had a experience in another dimension, a voyage in time space! This film must be inspired Terry Gilliam to direct the Twelve Monkeys, after. I think both films are similar although 12 Monkeys is better than Time Bandits, I think.Congratulations to Terry Gilliam and all the cast!",Time Bandits
143,lau-30,The Ogre and his wife are worth the whole film!,8,22 July 2006,"One of my favourite movies! The Napoleon scene is not quite funny enough, and the small parts that Michael Palin has written for himself are not good. But things get better and better as the movie progresses, and it is a fantastically great idea to make the most valuable thing in the world a new kitchen that one can win in a crazy TV-quiz show! The whole film is good and the devil in particular ""turned out rather well"" as Ralph Richardson puts it! The only thing it took me time to really understand was the way 'the supreme being' is portrayed. Ralph Richardson is actually doing a parody of God!! Extremely daring I think, he might have stepped on a lot of peoples' toes. But he does it well, and hopefully God (if he exists) has a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at himself. Many people seem to dislike the ship-scene with the ogre and his wife for some reason. ""It's too long"", ""a bit boring"", ""doesn't really work"" are some of the comments I've heard. That scene is my top favourite!!! ""Darling, You ARE terrible"" is the funniest flattering remark I can think of! And the Ogre IS terrible - wonderfully terrible!

144,bcigor,Triumph of Imagination and Creativity,10,11 December 2005,"There are some really visually amazing movies. They do not have a good story, they are not that rich with special effects, but they are so unreal and beautiful that despite all their bad parts, they just grow on you.Time Bandits - is one of this movies. A great imagination by Terry Gilliam and ex-Python Michael Palin, who wrote the script to this modern fairy tale with satiric sparkles in it.Of course, this movie is great for kids. They'll love it for its imagination, that drives away from the real world to fantasy. But still there are a lot of smart jokes or even not jokes in it. Adults will possibly love this movie too, if they are at least have a 1 millimeter in the head, that is still owned by a child. Because it's very nice to see main actors jumping off from one historical period to another, meeting some wonderful people.I loved jokes in this movie. It starts from credits. You see 'John Cleese', 'Sean Connery' and etc in the list but ... none of them is a main character, and all of them are appearing for a very brief period of time in the movie. For John Cleese (who is playing Robin Hood) it's just 2-3 minutes. For Sean Connery a bit more, but still not enough to put him into starting credits, ignoring all the Real small actors. That's a joke, as far as i see. Next joke are parents. It's not even a joke, it's a satire on the modern technology and television. I love the part when the TV showman asks a question ""the name of what famous movie star begins with an 'S'?"". The biggest laugh i've head was without doubt The Most Fabulous object in the world. What IS it - you'd better find out yourself, but i find it the most satiric and yet real part of the movie. The ""Supreme Being"" part is great.But Time Bandits wouldn't be a great movie without terrific acting. So here we go. Ian Holm as Napoleon is fantastic. His obsession with him being so small is great played. The most wonderful character in the movie. Robin Hood by John Cleese is the best Cameo in the movie. GREAT part. Sean Connery ... well i never liked him, but still he plays good in Time Bandits despite all the ""new movies"" with him. Michael Palin is fantastic. ""I must have fruit"" scene ... uh. Better see it. And of course the Evil and Supreme Being. They all deserve their 5 out 5. Or 10 out of 10. Doesn't matter.The last part is coming. The movie itself. It's meaning if it has one. Well, this one doesn't try to show us the meaning of life, but still asks a few questions. Mainly about god, television, a little social stuff and some history things. The main part in Time Bandits isn't the meaning of it all though. It's the visuals. Lacking of special effects is completely replaced by the great vision of Terry Gilliam. Fantasy is all the way around. The ""Fortress of Ultimate Darkness"" is one of the greatest sets i've ever seen. Madness, creativity and imagination - that's the plot of the movie. Terry Gilliam has a great vision, though a bit distorted and not ""for everyone"", but still it deserves to be seen.Time Bandits is some sort of an easy-going, simple fairy tail with some satiric and philosophical things deep inside. You will lose nothing if you won't notice them. It's not about this things, but it's about a journey to an unknown, an adventure in the deepest part of your imagination. Great Movie.Oh and by the way, produced by George Harrison. And he wrote a song to Time Bandits. So, The Beatles fans - go and see it as well.",Time Bandits

149,sezai_crane,'two Terry Gilliams',6,13 May 2001,"The first Terry Gilliam movie I ever saw was 'Brazil': I was thrilled for a very long time. It was so different from all the things I had seen till then. And in some ways it still is. Then I saw '12 monkeys'. There was again that very sharp and serious movie making coupled with a lots of imagination and fantasy. I was just sitting on the tip of my chair, trying to get every second carved in my memory.Then I saw 'Baron Munchausen', 'The fisher king' and now finally 'Time bandits'. I couldn't believe that it was the same person making these movies. Though 'The fisher king' was better, 'Baron Munchausen' and 'Time Bandits' just didn't touch me. They are too shallow, not really exciting, sometimes even boring. I think it's because Gilliam is trying to be too Pythonesque in these movies in a not quite genuine Monty Python way. His special way of making SFX just don't work in half serious half trying to be funny movies.There are of course some very touching or amazing moments, like the part with the giant coming out of the water or the part with Connery beating a monster like creature, but then, who could resist his very charming acting of such a simple and I'm-enjoying-life type of Agamemnon. He seems to be made for it. But I think a movie shouldn't be just a jumble of not really in a logical way connected scenes with great actors in it. I for one still need this very sharp structuring of the plot, like in '12 monkeys', that makes you have a couple of moments of clarity while moving along the story. That's what I miss in 'Time Bandits': when 'God' at the end tells that he had planned it all to test his creation, it just spoils the importance of what has happened before: the whole movie. It's all just trying to be too cheerful for me.",Time Bandits

The special effects are carefully done with a love for the details and the proof for the fact, that plastic modeling can work just as well or even better than modern 3D computer- based models (of course that only applies for stationary objects). CAST I did very much like the cast, led (in quality of performance) by (Sir) Ian Holm as Napoleon with an inferiority complex both drunk and sober, always borderline insane and performed brilliantly. Also several members of Monty Python funny as usual (although sadly unsurprising) and a not-so-bad Sean Connery as Agamemnon, charming and smiling, heroic and charismatic (business as usual for him but still). Additionally Craig Roberts as Kevin and David Rappaport as Randall, the more or less tough leader of the Bandits, perform fairly well too.PLOT The plot is fairly if not impressively creative, very well thought out and does like so many time-travel-stories force one to actually think about the (plausbility of the) time line. GENERAL But as a movie this project is rather unfinished, as though final version is in fact not the final version, but instead still misses several cutting-processes to tighten the story up. Especially the ending, or rather the final showdown between the Bandits and Evil is so faltering that it appears to be a mere collection of shots, about which nobody has yet decided which ones to show and which ones to cut out.",Time Bandits

Well,one day playing this sad sport there was a kid who didn't speak,just looked,with this composed face. He was deaf. They made fun of him,but he helped us win the game. Somehow I got the courage to try and communicate to him that he was cool. We agreed on seeing a movie. He said ""time bandits"" in a warbled but cognicent way. I was afraid of those trailers;you had to be an outcast or something to see that scary film. But we met up at the theatre in berkeley,and once the movie started it became apparent that this was a ""special"" film. No,a really,really,COOL film! Scary at times,but ""interesting"" as OG would say. I couldn't believe how captivating this film was,and once it hit cable I even taped the film with a tape deck. The dialogue and acting and execution of everything made it ""believable"" in the sense you could be saved by a fantasy film like this and not capitulate to the American materialism that has imbued all art from every perspective. Once the 70's were over the 80's was a last hurrah or boo,depending if you enjoyed the 80's. The only way to make another film like this is to follow the old concepts. English theatre is more real in that sense. Remember,time bandits is a film that never had video or DVD in the back of it's mind,so try to take this film in correctly. Is it worth watching? You've got to be joking! Of course it is! Soon you will be writing the dalogue down in long hand.I never met that kid again,but we both have that moment when we stepped out of our own worlds and became entranced in this bizarre vision.

158,mattybonz-2,A tribute to the imagination and ability of Terry Gilliam,9,26 February 2000,"Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits is a work of supreme craft and imagination, and a prime example of his unchallenged ability to reduce the unreal and fantastic to the big screen.Made in the time before the wonders of digital effects, Gilliam nevertheless manages to create some unforgettable images, among them a living breathing giant and a forbidding Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, and give them a sense of reality that few other directors could manage.Gilliam, who co-wrote the screenplay with fellow Monty Python alum Michael Palin, tells the story of young Kevin, played ably by Craig Warnock. Ignored by parents too enamoured with progress and products, Kevin loses himself in his toys and dreams, until, one fateful night, those dreams come to vivid life.David Rappaport leads a band of midget explorers, traversing holes in the fabric of space-time in search of history's greatest treasures (which they proceed to pocket), who Kevin unwittingly joins up with. Sir Ralph Richardson plays the Supreme Being, who pursues the band of travellers to reclaim his stolen map of the holes in time; and David Warner is perfect as the personification of Evil, delivering every line with relish.Other stand-out performers include John Cleese as a charmingly polite though slightly demented Robin Hood, Ian Holm as Napoleon, and Sean Connery, who does a masterful turn as King Agamemnon.As with all Gilliam works, nothing is exactly what it seems, and even backgrounds and scenery must be viewed carefully, to see what they really are. As an added bonus, George Harrison provides some cool original music. Appropriate for anyone ages 8-80, Time Bandits is enjoyable, engrossing, and just plain fun.",Time Bandits
159,raj_m76,Hugely Disappointing!,3,13 August 2005,I know Terry Gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish. What was the movie about? What is it a spoof? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No answer there from Gilliam's screenplay. Totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another. I find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. Is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about?? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981. Roger Ebert has it right in his review. The movie is ambiguous and looks like Gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue.

While there are a lot of interesting ideas scattered throughout the work, it ends up becoming a somewhat modernized regurgitation of Gulliver's Travels. The original characterization of the parents isn't very effective, Satan does carnival tricks to defeat the good guys (Go Go Gadget knife), and God comes traipsing in during the finale to reveal his ultimate plan. Not only does Gilliam cop out with deus ex machina, but he uses the cliché of waking from a dream as well. While he undermines this by killing off the boy's parents, that only serves to leave an 8 year old kid with nothing in the world. And then Sean Connery winks at him?

Up untill now I thought nothing was worth running for (not even Ewan McGregor... bite my tounge). Let me tell you guys.... THIS was worth running for! I'm a big campy movie person, and if you, like I love movies such as ""moulin rouge!"" ""little shop of horrors"" or ""the labyrinth"" you will love this! It was very funny and clever and that little boy (Craig something-or-other) had the cutest accent. A little boy that is british and cannot pronouce his R's... ""a wubbewy?"". Honestly, this movie is brilliant. I would not however, suggest this to Die-Hard Palin fans, like myself. If you're going to see something for the main purpose of Mike go see ""Full Circle"", he was in this for maybe 5 minutes altogether. Anyone else I think would love it. Palin and Gilliam... you hit a another homerun!!!",Time Bandits
165,illespal,With today's standard this is almost unwatchable,4,18 September 2021,"We couldn't watch it thru. The Napoleon scene was just plain boring, the joke fall flat. A few more scenes and we stopped watching it, it being very bad acting even for a comedy. Potentially good idea, badly executed.",Time Bandits
166,dandannyd-1,My favorite film of all time.,10,26 December 2003,"This is THE definitive work on the nature of good and evil. It asks the age old question: Who is the Supreme Being, and what is it exactly that he wants from us? Terry Gilliam gives us a morality tale wrapped inside a an epic poem seen in the guise of an abstract painting.As a film, all the seperate elements are perfect, and blended together seemlessly by the hand of the maestro Gilliam. It is not only a brilliant comedy, but an enthralling story as well. This is a film that sparks discussion and debate that goes on well into the night.It is the rarest of all cinematic creatures-- a movie that is a genuine pleasure to watch and one that makes you think.",Time Bandits
167,ldale,The best film of a kid for the kids,9,24 April 2005,"I don't know how many times i have watched this film on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but however many times i have seen this, the more it stands. I would say it is perhaps Gilliams most enjoyable film. I say this in terms of the fact that it requires less thinking than if you watched another of Gilliams films, step forward Brazil. Many have said that Gilliams films stray away from his Python roots, however the giant sequence is a bit of python if ever i did see it. Though it is the endless cameos that are the highlight of this film, i find that the dwarf actors are fantastic. Especially Jack Purvis and David Rapparport. However the star turn should essentially go to the great Ralph Richardson. Thrifty, Suave and a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae of a film.",Time Bandits
168,nichstarling,"Quirky, engaging and made with love",9,27 October 2017,"This is a film with a massive heart. It engages both adults and children. I first watched this when I was 12, my brother was 9. We sat with our parents, all of us laughing and really engaging with the silliness and surprises throughout. It does rely on having a very British sense of humour, and anyone who gets Monty python will have no problem with this, but I would challenge anyone not to find the premise and execution of this film anything other than highly engaging.",Time Bandits
169,douglucchetti,Anyone know about music in Mycenea?,10,8 February 2007,"Time Bandits remains one of my all time favorites. One of the many thing about it which have fascinated me from the very first viewing occurs during the scene when our band of miscreant mini-buskers appear in ancient Mycenea at a feast commemorating Agamemnon's adopting our reluctant time-traveling character, Kevin. The joy-riding time and space janitors this time are disguised in costumes that convey the feeling of ancient Mycenaean/Grecian design particularly well. In addition to the fantastic costume and set design, the scene is accompanied by the music of a small troupe of musicians who seem to be playing archaic instruments, and furthermore, the tune itself I've found unforgettable and wonder if anyone knows anything about it or the musical director/composer. Thanks.",Time Bandits
170,benicek-hall,deep satire dressed as a kids' movie,10,26 May 2005,"Time Bandits is a deeply satirical morality tale superficially packaged as a kid's adventure film. On the surface it seems simple enough; a young boy, Kevin, is spirited away by a gang of time travelling comedy dwarfs for a series of adventures in different historical settings. But there's a lot more to it than that. Kevin's parents are a grotesque caricature of self-absorbed suburban materialism; incessantly arguing about kitchen appliances while watching brainless TV gameshows at full volume. It is Gilliam's attention to detail which really makes this film for me. Kevin's parents don't eat anything which hasn't come out of a microwave or blender and are too precious even to remove the plastic wrapping from their hideous three-piece suite. Kevin, meanwhile, is a romantic who, until the fateful night the Time Bandits arrive in his bedroom, can only live out his fantasies in history books.But history turns out not to be all it's cracked up to be. Napoleon is crippled by an inferiority complex stemming from his small stature; Robin Hood is a patronising liar and his 'merry men' are a bunch of violent filthy animals. Only in mythical Greece does Kevin come close to realising his dreams.The film retains a dark edge throughout. As Gilliam explains in his DVD commentary, by casting small people as the bandits, led by the delightfully arrogant David Rappaport, he hoodwinks the audience into swallowing their extreme cupidity. The innocent Kevin (played by a child actor deliberately selected for his shyness) finds himself swept into company even more mindlessly greedy than that of his parents'. At this stage we are introduced to David Warner's deliciously over-acted 'evil genius'; a Satan obsessed with modern technology (but, ironically, surrounded by decay and incompetence), who plots to entrap the time travellers. The film gathers momentum towards the inevitable showdown between good and evil but Gilliam leaves this disturbingly inconclusive. God, played by Ralph Richardson as an intimidating schoolmaster, assures us that he is in control but that misery and suffering are all that we can expect (""something to do with free will"") and Kevin's troubles have only begun. Ultimately this is a very British film which speaks to lonely idealists everywhere.",Time Bandits
171,denim_trousers,"Terrible movie, but Cleese is hilarious!",4,16 September 2005,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It was lagging in the storyline and I was unable to connect with any of the characters. When one of the dwarfs dies, I felt no pity or sympathy or anything of the sort. I simply thought, ""Another one bites the dust."" This movie is simply terrible.However, the small scene with John Cleese as Robin Hood is absolutely hilarious! The lines are witty, clever, and silly, not to mention the laugh-out-loud physical comedy brought upon the poor by the Not-So-Merry Men.In short, if this movie is on TV, then tape the Robin Hood scene and watch it until you can't breathe. Other than that, don't bother.",Time Bandits
172,christinaanthony-51207,Time bandits is a fascinating movie,8,19 November 2015,"I've watched this movie and I found it quite interesting. The story is written in a very creative and imaginative way, which fascinates me in a way. It's also quite addictive, because they're many interesting plots. As for the characters, Kevin, is very smart and intelligent and the 6 dwarfs represents selfishness and greediness. But they changed in the end and realized they're mistakes. The writer shows a very imaginative side of him in this movie, by basing the movie on time traveling through portals, and basing on good and bad. I really love the ending when the good side wins over the bad side but I don't really understand why Kevin's parent had to explode. Why can't they just end it with a happy ending like, Kevin return back to his normal life and no one find out what happen. It's just my own opinion on how to end the movie.",Time Bandits

And so the madcap chase is on through space and time, a bright youngster nabbed along the way simply for the hell of it. That's it. And it's beautiful.",Time Bandits
174,hajjamujja,Not at all funny. Just a boring fantasy movie,2,21 January 2006,"This movie is utter crap. I watched it expecting a Monty Python in the style of The Holy Grail or Life of Brian. Instead I get a fantasy movie with hardly any jokes at all. Although it actually says ""One of the funniest films of all time"" on the back I can honestly not believe that anybody could find this funny.I could respect if someone thinks even the lousiest sitcom is fun. But not this... this is just too terrible.It's basically a half decent fantasy movie being passed off as a comedy.Can't believe that John Cleese and Sean Connery (who stars in some really small roles) would lend their skills to such rubbish.",Time Bandits
