0,TheLittleSongbird,Appealing,7,1 June 2011,"Marley and Me is not an amazing movie by all means, the script does have uneven and sometimes jarring changes of tone from silly to serious to genuinely affecting, the story right down from the antics up to the ending is rather predictable on the surface and there are some parts that drag. But, most of the antics are quite funny on the other hand and the ending is poignant in a genuine sense. The whole film looks beautiful and the soundtrack is divine. The film is decently directed, and the acting from the leads Owen Wilson and Jennifer Anniston is appealing, and Eric Dane and Kathleen Turner provide excellent support. The dog steals the show though being incredibly endearing, the dog isn't just part of the film, the dog in many more ways than one IS the film. Overall, appealing film and quite touching. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Marley & Me
1,SnoopyStyle,Charming Wilson - Cute Dog - Heart in the Right Place,8,1 February 2014,"After a snow storm during their wedding, reporters John (Owen Wilson) and Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston) move to sunny Florida. First they get jobs, then they get a house, and now she's going through the rest of her steps. He surprises her to get a puppy to hold off the kid step. She picks the runt of the litter, Clearance Puppy.Aniston and Wilson have good chemistry in this movie. They seem like a real couple. Wilson has plenty of charm, and everybody loves a puppy. This is a very cute movie. It just needs a few more written jokes. Kathleen Turner is perfect set to go crazy as the dog trainer, but she just never gets wacky. That's what's missing from this movie. It needs a wacky side character. There is a lot of Marley misbehaving, and that's kind of fun. And then there is heart break also. It feels like a real couple with some cuteness added. When the sad parts come, they always hit the mark.",Marley & Me
2,mark.waltz,Puppy power!!!,8,15 November 2016,"At 3 months, oh you are so cute! At 2 years, wow, you have so much energy. At 4, did you just pee on the carpet again? At 7, you're my best friend! And sometime after 10, what I'd do to go through all that again. Dogs are a necessary existence for many of people, and from Rin Tin Tin to Lassie to Old Yeller to even Scooby Doo, there's a reason why they are called man's best friend.For Owen Wilson, well, he looks like a dog in human form, sort of dorky, rather clumsy, yet smart and funny without realizing it. He's married to Jennifer Aniston here, an actress I've on occasion found lacking warmth and sort of unpassionate on screen. So it's obvious from the start that she'll be cool to the idea of a puppy, yet in time, it will grow on her no matter what she indicates out of frustration over the years. She does manage to warm up somewhat after tantrum throwing towards Wilson that briefly strains their marriage, and by the end of the film, you realize that this trouble-making mini horse is as important to her as their three children. Puppies are adorable and affectionate on the first meeting, but once they are adopted, their mischievous nature comes out, and Marley is no exception. Puppies also grow, annoy neighbors by howling when they're alone, eat their fill of kibble, and pee and poop at will. But once you've got that first taste of puppy breath, you're hooked, no matter how foul it is. A very funny cameo by Kathleen Turner shows an unsuccessful attempt to train the fast growing pooch. The always likable Alan Arkin plays Wilson's understanding Lou Grant like boss. Alec Mapa has a funny cameo as a rather obnoxious dog owner on the dog beach who judgmentally tries to tell Wilson a thing or two about what's permitted on the beach and what is not. This comedy drama documents all of those emotions, and while it takes time, the puppy is as much a part of the family as the babies they have. Of course, the three children they have see nothing but perfection in this messy but lovable lab, not at all impacted by its largeness as the dog watcher they hire ends up being. Marley isn't a slobbering mess like Beethoven or Turner's ""Hooch"", just a free spirit you can't help but fall in love with. Grab your Kleenex and go to town balling your eyes out, 'cause you will be crying both from laughing and from exploring many emotions over the circle of life that comes around for all dogs.",Marley & Me
3,claudio_carvalho,The Clearance Puppy,7,25 April 2009,"The journalists John (Owen Wilson) and Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston) get married in the cold Michigan and immediately move to the sunny Florida. John, that aims to be a reporter, is reluctantly hired by a local newspaper to write a column. Meanwhile, John buys a Labrador ""clearance puppy"" for Jennifer to avoid (or postpone) having children. His newspaper column becomes successful with his articles based on his daily life experience with the clumsy and impulsive Marley. The Grogan's have three children, move to Philadelphia sharing their best and worst moments in family with their beloved dog until the day the inevitable happens.""Marley & Me"" is really a great family entertainment. First, whoever has ever had a dog, certainly knows the pain of the loss. Then the story based on a true event is absolutely believable, with great dialogs and realistic characters. The chemistry between the lovely Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson is amazing. Last but not the least, the dogs are hilarious. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Marley & Eu"" (""Marley & Me"")",Marley & Me
4,kosmasp,Pieces,2,24 July 2009,"I'm sure this comment won't get many ""helpful"" votes here. But I'm not writing or commenting a movie to be popular or go with the stream. I'm writing about what I feel (or felt) when I watched this movie. And let me clear one thing from the start -> I do love animals (not only dogs, but any kind of animal).Having said that and seeing that this movie is not a comedy (which is very misleading as is the trailer where Owen and Jennifer are running in slo-mo on the beach), but a drama. A drama, where the dog is actually in the lead role. Unfortunately though, we're not staying long enough with him to enjoy him.Owen Wilson gets to much screen time and although he (and Jennifer Aniston for that matter) have proved, that they can act ""drama"" rather than comedy, their performance suffers badly, because of the story developments. While we see those both, we never really truly get a feeling of them being together. The dog is supposed to be the ""link"" that holds them together, but that only shines through at the end and even then it feels forced.There are nice sub-stories interwoven into the whole plot. But they just manage to make the whole experience even worse, because it seems like mini-sketches taken from different families put in a mixer. The result gets served and the viewer is supposed to digest all that without chewing any of it. It just doesn't work.The family life isn't really depicted clearly, the fact that we leap through time, make family members look like extras. You never really get to see them and are supposed to feel for/with them? The fact that I love the dog, doesn't change the fact, that the movie isn't balanced right and therefor not something I can recommend",Marley & Me
5,jboothmillard,Marley & Me,6,16 July 2011,"I saw this film mentioned a few times on some programmes and stuff, so I knew a little about the premise, and I was certainly interested, from director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada). Based on the true story, John (Owen Wilson) and Jennifer 'Jenny' Grogan (Jennifer Aniston) are the newly married couple who both write for newspapers and have moved to Florida. Suggested by his friend Sebastian Tunney (Eric Dane) that it will slow her interest in having children, John gets Jenny a yellow Labrador retriever puppy, he names it Marley after reggae singer Bob Marley. Marley grows 100 pounds into a very mischievous, disobedient and uncontrollable dog, even the woman who believes any dog can be trained, Ms. Kornblut (Kathleen Turner), gives up with him. Editor Arnie Klein (Alan Arkin) offers John a promotion writing twice weekly instead of obituaries, and after originally being stumped for what to write, he decides to write about the misadventures of Marley, and with plenty of chaos and havoc created there is plenty of material that becomes a hit with readers. After losing their first baby in miscarriage, so they go for the overdue honeymoon vacation to Ireland, leaving a young woman to care for the troublesome Marley, who is especially impossible to control in a thunderstorm. They return home and find out Jenny is pregnant again, and they overjoyed when she gives birth to a healthy boy, Patrick, followed by their second son, Connor, and she considers giving up work to be a stay-at-home. Therefore John is promoted again to do a daily column and they move to a bigger house in the neighbourhood of Boca Raton with a swimming pool in the backyard. She denies having it, but Jenny shows all the symptoms of postnatal depression, like becoming impatient and overly angry with John or Marley, she even shouts that she wants Marley gone, so he is taken to Sebastian until she calms down. Of course she realises Marley is family and should never be taken away, so she agrees he can stay, and a few years later the family welcome another child, their first daughter, Colleen. After celebrating his fortieth birthday and accepting a new job as a reporter for another newspaper, and the family move again to a farm in Pennsylvania, he does find though he is better as a columnist. An ageing Marley starts showing signs that he is getting on, such as having arthritis and deafness, his stomach is twisted at one point but it does eventually settle. But this attack occurs again, and it looks less likely he can recover, and surgery cannot help, all the family say their sad goodbyes as the kindest thing they can do is put him to sleep, so John does this, this bury him in the front yard under a tree, and Jenny places a necklace in his grave. Also starring Haley Bennett as Lisa, Ann Dowd as Dr. Platt and Clarke Peters as Editor. Wilson and Aniston make a nice human on screen couple, you can feel all their everyday emotions and stuff, and of course the dog of the title is a lovable canine that anyone would be lucky to have. I could empathise with the ending completely having lost pets myself, it really was a tearful conclusion, it is a sweet simple film that is essentially a family story, not a plot as such but very charming, funny, emotional and you can relate to, a very watchable comedy drama based on a true story. Good!",Marley & Me
6,moonspinner55,"Inexplicably popular family-unit fantasy...the title alone is bad news (shouldn't it be ""Marley & Us"" ?)",3,21 June 2011,"Newlywed couple in chilly Philadelphia relocate to Florida; before the 10-minute mark is up, they both have jobs at competing newspapers, have found and purchased a home, and have picked out a Labrador puppy. Screenwriters Scott Frank and Don Roos, adapating John Grogan's bestselling memoir, seem to work in shorthand, and the movie--though meticulously produced--is wholly underwhelming. The troublesome Lab (so-named after the husband hears a Bob Marley song on the radio) tears up pillows and chews through drywall; by the time the dog has gotten bigger and tackles a militant obedience trainer (Kathleen Turner, looking pained), we've already had enough of the graceless, galumphing animal. The humans fare no better, with Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson just going through the motions (she talks to him in the same tone she uses with Marley, while he continually talks through his nose). The opening soundtrack song (""Shiny Happy People"") sums up this lightweight picture's ultimate ambition: to be a sweet, fantasy-version of life, complete with Alan Arkin as a newspaper editor right out of a 1940s comedy. There's nothing wrong with innocuous doggy tales, but this one is never as charming as it's meant to be, and there's hardly a good, honest laugh in it. *1/2 from ****",Marley & Me
7,tavm,Marley & Me was a pretty amusing movie about a young couple and their dog,7,29 June 2009,"Just watched this movie on Blu-Ray disc with my mother. Since this was a dog movie involving two comic actors, I half expected lots of laughs. There were some with Kathleen Turner as a dog trainer and some witty lines from Alan Arkin as Owen Wilson's Florida newspaper boss but despite many scenes of Marley wreaking havoc, there weren't much hilarity in this movie just some amused chuckles from me and Mom. Knowing this was based on a book by the author Wilson plays, I didn't expect to see everything that was on the written page to be filmed. Still, despite some obvious omissions, there was much to like here and the final scenes were touchingly sad if not completely heartbreaking. Having not read the book, I don't know how much of this movie is true. Still, if you like dogs and the lead characters played by Owen and Jennifer Aniston, I heartily recommend Marley & Me.",Marley & Me
8,edwagreen,Marley and Me is a Movie's Best Friend ***1/2,9,12 October 2009,"Please note that this review is coming from a non-dog lover. I have to admit that this is definitely a heart-warming film of a family's devotion to a dog.To say that this dog is lively is to put it mildly. Kathleen Turner, who has a brief one scene role as a dog trainer, proves that even the so called experts can't predict the love and affection a dog will bring even when that dog is quite wild.The dog comes into the life of newlyweds Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson. Both have probably the best roles of their film careers so far. While the dog seems to be out of control, their love of it transcends all. It helps them through the loss of a baby and is there to bring further joy when 3 children are born subsequently.The ending will certainly bring a tear to everyone. It certainly proves that man's best friend is a dog. This film is the ultimate equivalent to the memorable ""Terms of Endearment,"" dog wise.",Marley & Me
9,studioAT,A modern day weepy,4,4 September 2017,"This film did very well based on word of mouth, and become one of the big tear jerkers of recent times.It features good performances from its human stars, Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, but the star of the show is of course the dog playing Marley.It's very much a tear jerker, so be warned.",Marley & Me

11,Hey_Sweden,"An intelligent, heartfelt comedy / drama...but be prepared to sob.",8,18 November 2018,"Owen Wilson is typically amiable as John Grogan, a young man with aspirations of being a reporter, but whose life takes a different turn. He ends up taking over for a columnist, and his pieces prove to be a big hit, especially when he regales readers with his uproarious tales of trying to look after his incorrigible but endearing yellow lab, Marley. The film takes us through the various stages of life for John and his wife Jenny (Jennifer Aniston, very appealing as always), with Marley being the one constant.If this WERE just the story of a loveably crazy, misbehaving canine, ""Marley & Me"" would still be entertaining, but it wouldn't have the same amount of staying power. Because ultimately, it's about subjects relatable to MANY people: getting that first big job, starting married life, becoming parents, dealing with other major life changes, etc. It's an effective film balancing the sometimes very funny wacky comedy of Marley's misadventures with more serious and poignant moments.Through it all, John and Jenny remain a likeable, average, good-hearted couple dealing with the various ups and downs of their lives and careers. The film boasts a solid supporting cast: Eric Dane as Johns' shameless, bachelor friend who regularly gets more prestigious assignments, Alan Arkin as their supportive boss, a nearly unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as instructor in a dog obedience class, Ann Dowd as a veterinarian, and Clarke Peters as an editor. The various canines playing Marley from age to age are all wonderful, as well, giving us a very memorable canine character to add to the canon of family entertainment.Granted, this does feel quite manipulative at times, and soft touches and pet lovers should be forewarned: Marley's life is followed all the way to the end. It's advised that viewers have plenty of hankies on hand.Provided that the audience is ready for a good cry, this is one genuinely interesting mix of humour and heart that this viewer would recommend to others.Eight out of 10.",Marley & Me
12,preppy-3,"Morbid, manipulative and predictable",1,9 November 2009,"A boring couple (Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson) adopt a VERY cute puppy (he's posed so the audience is forced to say ""awwwwww"" every time he appears on screen). Naturally he's VERY full of life and wreaks havoc. They try to have strict Ms. Kornblut (an unrecognizable Kathleen Turner who's hilarious) to train him...but that fails. They decide to keep him cause he's SO cute and we get the predictable ""funny"" antics of a hyperactive dog. Then the couple has kids and this turns into a dreary domestic drama. DEFINITE SPOILERS!!!!! Then the dog gets sick (you KNEW this was coming) and dies. **SPOILERS!!!** YECCH! I have nothing against dogs but this movie is shameless. It pulls out all stops to make the audience see how adorable the dog is THEN goes full force when the poor thing dies. It's impossible NOT to cry when you see a bunch of kids crying over the sick dog but I think it's disgusting that people filmed this and thought it was entertaining. It's morbid and sick. I have nothing against tear jerkers but the best ones make you cry cause you know the characters and care about them (like ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Longtime Companion""). With this you barely know the characters so they shove the crying kids in your face to get a reaction. Also, personally, I didn't find the dog that cute or adorable. The film is also far too long and, frankly, gets very dull. To make it worse we get Alan Arkin giving another lousy performance as a ""lovable"" gruff newspaper editor.On the plus side it IS beautifully filmed with a nice music score. Wilson appears drugged but it fits his character. Aniston is OK in her role. Eric Dane is excellent in a small part as Sebastian. Tall and handsome he nicely underplays his role. And Turner IS hysterical in her small role. But, all in all, this movie made me miserable and angry for being so blatantly manipulated. Dog lovers will probably love this but I advise you to steer clear.",Marley & Me

Its not that its a bad movie, its just that the film seemed to be trying too hard to be a feel good life lesson. I'm all for that but at the same time I don't want to know at the start I don't want to know its good for me. I'd rather discover it on my own. The cast is quite good across the board with Owen Wilson giving a nicely restrained and straight forward performance.Recommend for animal lovers",Marley & Me
14,zardoz-13,"Nothing Surprising, But Pleasantly Sentimental Saga About A Bad-To-The-Bone Dog",8,12 January 2009,"Anybody who wants a pet Labrador retriever should watch the new Owen Wilson & Jennifer Aniston canine comedy ""Marley & Me"" (*** out of ****), so they'll know everything that Labs chomp. Clearly, director David Frankel, whose last movie was the Anne Hathaway career comedy ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" wanted to explore entirely different themes, and he succeeds on the whole with this sentimental, shaggy dog saga. Ostensibly, scenarists Scott Frank of ""Get Shorty"" and Don Roos of ""Bounce"" adapted former ""Philadelphia Inquirer"" columnist John Grogan's memoirs about the 13 years that his family and he spent with a Lab. Basically, Hollywood makes two kinds of dog movies: those where the dog lives and those where the dog dies. Smuggle in a box of Kleenex if you see ""Marley & Me."" Mind you, ""Marley & Me"" amounts to suburban schmaltz, nowhere as realistic as the Disney classic ""Old Yeller"" (1957) where the boy shot his dog after the animal contracted rabies. Despite some mild profanity, ""Marley & Me"" qualifies as family-oriented fare. Indeed, this aw-shucks, PG-rated, feel-good flick about a loyal but neurotic Alpha Lab will amuse you and make you chuckle, even though it wears out its welcome with its two-hour plus running time. Aside from one scene involving a dog obedience trainer, you shouldn't have to explain anything to your little ones.John (Owen Wilson of ""Drillbit Taylor"") and Jenny Grogan (Jennifer Aniston of ""Derailed"") marry in snowswept Michigan and promptly move to a warmer climate. They settle in Palm Beach, Florida. Jenny lands a job as a features writer at The Palm Beach Post. John's college chum Sebastian Tunney (Eric Dane of TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"") gets him an interview at The Sun-Sentinel. Grumpy Sun-Sentinel editor Arnie Klein (Alan Arkin of ""Inspector Clouseau"") hires John on the spot and sends him off to cover stories about speed bumps, methane fires, and the latest Rotary Club row. Jenny likes to make lists, while John tries to accommodate those lists. No sooner has our cute couple settled into a three-bedroom house than Sebastian warns John that Jenny will want a baby unless he sideswipes her biological clock. Sebastian suggests John buy her a dog. John sells the dog idea belatedly to Jenny after he blindfolds and takes his wife out to a dog farm. They pick what comes to be known as 'the clearance dog.' Jenny has to cover an out-of-town trial, so John gets to pick up the pooch. On his way home, John hears Bob Marley reggae music on the radio and decides that the musician's last name is ideal for his hound. The Grogans learn quickly that life with Marley won't be a picnic. Marley devours dog food like a glutton. Moreover, this incorrigible cur chews up pillows, bras, sofa cushions, and even Jenny's necklace. He likes to chase the UPS man, the mail man, and he steals a next door neighbor's turkey dinner.When director David Frankel and his scribes aren't depicting Marley's next prank, they dwell on the ups and downs of domesticity. The Grogans have a tough time getting their family started, but they wind up with three kids, two boys and a girl. Jenny quits her job to play house mom and discovers the toll that some young moms encounter after having kids. John sacrifices his dream of being a reporter and reluctantly accepts a cushy columnist's job. As it turns out, John's editor Arnie loves our hero's columns about his rambunctious yellow Alpha Lab who destroys restaurants, causes traffic jams, and assaults dog obedience trainers. Anybody who loves Kathleen Turner had better be prepared for a shock. Turner turns up in a cameo as Ms. Kornblut, gravelly-voiced battle axe, far from the delectable dame of ""Romancing the Stone."" Marley drags Kornblut around on his leash and then . . . well, you'll have to take the little ones aside and tell them about the birds and the bees. Eventually, Marley grows old and we know that something dire is in store.It's difficult to believe that the real-life Grogans lived this sunny lifestyle. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston maintain their fluffy blond mops and slender waistlines. Rarely do they blow a fuse. Occasionally, Jenny screams about Marley's problem with thunderstorms. He howls like a conscientious bloodhound that has just cornered a raccoon in a tree and he doesn't stop until the rain stops. Eric Dane plays John's best friend and babe magnet Sebastian who snags all the great newspaper stories and eventually becomes a New York Times reporter. John envies Sebastian and then when John leaves the Sun-Sentinel for The Philadelphia Inquirer to write real news, he realizes how much he loved being a columnist. Nobody told him how to write his own column and everybody loved to read it. It's also pretty hard to believe that John Grogan pulled down the kind of salary that enabled him to buy a sprawling house with a swimming pool in Florida and then later an even bigger one in rural Pennsylvania. Reportedly, from young puppy to old dog, Frankel had to use as many as 22 dogs to impersonate Marley.As far as canine comedies go, ""Marley & Me"" doesn't spring many surprises, but this harmless potboiler about a bad-to-the-bone dog does a good job of straining on your heart strings.",Marley & Me

17,neil-476,Not as good as the reaction might lead you to think,7,19 March 2009,"Marley And Me isn't that good a film. Oh, it's not that bad, but it really isn't No 1 at the box office material, despite the fact that that is where it has been hanging out - that success is more a comment on its competition, I think.The film breaks down into 3 broad sections. In act one, newlyweds Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston get a labrador puppy as an excuse for putting off a decision about starting a family and it turns out the dog is wilful, disobedient, untrainable and destructive - how hilarious. In act two, other matters start taking hold - they start a family, there are job issues, they move etc., and Marley is always part of the equation. In act three, Marley's age and illnesses lead to the inevitable conclusion.Act one irritated me - so many of the problems could have been avoided by keeping Marley on a lead - simple responsible dog ownership. Act two I quite enjoyed: although it was somewhat soapy, it held my interest. Act three is of course the clincher, and the one which sends you out of the cinema with tears rolling down your face (and boy were there some of those).Call me cynical, but I rather felt that being upset at the dog being put down was a foregone conclusion for anyone who has a degree of empathy in their body, and the fact that it is emotionally affecting doesn't necessarily mean that the film overall is good.Other things that irritated me were the fact that Jennifer Aniston's character referred to Owen Wilson as John Grogan in full 3 times in the first ten minutes, you know, just to make sure we didn't forget what his name was, or that the movie was based on a book by a real-life genuine person. Also, I shared Jennifer Aniston's irritation with the fact that whatever happened to her husband - and his life was pretty much a constant upward procession of good things happening - he was always hankering for something which was just out of reach. However, perhaps that was a genuine reflection of the real-life John Grogan.I quite understand that they had to use 20 different dogs to play Marley - what a shame that no two of them looked the same.Owen Wilson continues to get along by playing the same amiable character he has played in pretty much every movie I have ever seen him in, from Shanghai Noon to Wedding Crashers. Jennifer Aniston again showed tantalising glimpses of the actress of subtlety and power within her who deserves a substantially better film than this one.",Marley & Me
18,HotToastyRag,"A huge tearjerker, and not in a good way",2,12 June 2017,"I know you're going to want to see this movie. Owen Wilson—cutie pie, Jennifer Aniston—America's sweetheart, and a dog. Of course you're going to want to see it! Don't. Especially if you love dogs. The true story of an extremely selfish man whose bond with his dog exceeds his relationship with his wife. If it wasn't a true story, I would have faulted the screenwriter for writing such a one-dimensional ""typical male"" character, but since this person actually existed, I can only imagine how frustrated he must have been with his screen representation. Either that, or it was a realistic characterization and he didn't notice what a terrible person the world now knows he is.The ""me"" of Marley & Me aside, you still shouldn't see this movie if you're a dog or animal lover. I know I make it my policy to never give away spoilers, so hopefully I won't have to and you'll heed my warning. The preview of the movie will show lots of gags with the dog and some one-liners from Owen Wilson, but actually, this is a total tearjerker. If you've ever had a pet in your life, you will bawl. If you really want to put yourself through that, go ahead. I wouldn't go so far as to say I wish I hadn't seen it, but I'll remember the sadness for many years to come.",Marley & Me
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Marley & Me,7,27 February 2009,"Based upon the book by John Grogan, Marley & Me doesn't offer any new surprises in what's expected of from a story about Man's best friend, and having been just that to John Grogan (played by Owen Wilson) and his family, the story's very much a personal tale of the Grogans', though John's especially, relationship with their pet dog who had been a major part of their married and family life from the onset.While the trailer may have made this out to be a comedy through and through, this film's quite a typical dog-drama, where you have the antics of how one dog could turn one's life topsy-turvy especially when it's not properly trained. Picked out from a clearance sale by John and wife Jennifer (Jennifer Aniston), they soon find out that Marley's in contention in being the world's worst dog, and his behaviour just reinforces that  peeing indiscriminately, chewing everything, drinking from the toilet bowl, running everywhere and knocking into things. How the couple could endure and let it get away with his indiscipline, tells you how much they love that Labrador named after Bob Marley.But the film's more about family, or the creation of one. It actually follows the progression of how a newly married couple adapt to their new life, with some real world concerns like the next paycheck, and the issue with raising kids. Some things in life can be planned for while others come without warning, and the dog just ushered in a new phase of their lives with mutual responsibility over something else. Not to mention of course that it provides ample fuel for John's popular and growing column, despite his personal ambition in being a reporter rather than a columnist, like his buddy who gets to lead the life he could only dream of, in being where the action is.It's about priorities in life, where we have different goals and objectives that we want to achieve, which could run contrary to your partner's. It's about how we give certain issues precedence, and others having to take the back seat. It's about the sacrifices that we have to make from time to time, and therefore missing out on opportunities. It's about seizing opportunities that may seem like road-blocks only because they aren't very clear at the present time until manifestation at a later date. I was quite surprised indeed that these everyday life issues get succinctly masked from within the narrative of a ""dog-movie"".Running almost two hours long, the narrative does seem to fast forward itself in the second half because I thought it felt its first hour build up was taking a tad too long. Like real life when babies and kids come into your world, the focus you have on your individual pursuits get diminished. And in a mirror situation, the film becomes faced with an expanded cast of characters to deal with in the second half, resulting in a mixed balance of focus somewhat. Alan Arkin's role was totally hilarious as the editor of the Sun-Sentinel, and some of the more uplifting moments were where he graced the screen and lit it up with his character's wry humour. Owen is being plain ol' Owen, while Aniston successfully portrayed a (glamourous) housewife whose worries are all over the place.I had initially thought that Marley & Me had tried to emulate some success formulas from Japanese shows of similar canine nature. Fortunately it did have its own story to tell, thanks to the blueprint spelt out in the real John Grogan book (which got worked into the story here as well). It's a fairly good family drama that I felt could be stronger if it had placed equal emphasis in its second half as it did in the first.",Marley & Me
20,sddavis63,A Dog's Life,8,20 March 2009,"It's cute, it's funny, it's real and - in the end - it's very, very sad. If anyone can get through the last 15 minutes or so of this movie without crying there's something wrong with them. This is, basically, the life of Marley - a big, clumsy golden retriever whose adventures we follow from the time he's adopted as a puppy to - well - the end. Marley's life is what the movie is about. Yes, we also see the development of John and Jen's life, as they adopt Marley and then go on to have three kids and go through the ups and downs every married couple has to face, but it all comes back eventually to Marley. Every person who has ever owned a dog will understand this movie right from the start - the heartwarming joy of having the dog in your life, and the heartwrenching pain of having to say good-bye. Having been through that, those last fifteen minutes or so are so accurate. You know what's happening but you deny it; you convince yourself that your dog will bounce back even though you know he won't. Then - the decision. It was beautifully and sensitively portrayed.The main human actors are Jennifer Aniston as Jen and Owen Wilson as John. Aniston was very good, but I have to confess that something about Wilson didn't work for me. His acting was fine - no criticism of his performance; there was an intangible something about him in this role that didn't work the way it should have - I couldn't relate to him and Aniston as a couple. The only other problem with the movie was that John and Jen never changed. Marley aged and grew; their kids aged and grew - John and Jen looked exactly the same when the movie ended as they did when it began. Clearly, they found the Fountain of Youth while living in Florida. The movie is about Marley, though, and that part was superb.",Marley & Me
21,Robert_duder,A really touching cute movie for the true dog lovers out there,8,4 February 2009,"I think I kind of expected Marley and Me to be more of a raunchy, slapstick comedy but that isn't anything close to what the film brings to the table. Instead the film turns out to be touching and cute and funny without being over the top ridiculous and certainly not raunchy whatsoever. It's part love story, part man and best friend story but ultimately it is just a story told over years about a growing family, their trials and tribulations all held together by the presence by this mischievous and rambunctious Labrador. Not many films bring literal tears to my eyes, touches my emotions enough to leave me crying but I can tell you that tears streamed down my and my fiancée's face for the last fifteen minutes of the film. Anyone who has ever owned a dog, or loves an animal will be touched by this film. It isn't a sad event, or a shocking event that will bring tears but rather just the story of life. I don't recommend this film to anyone who has recently lost a pet although the story of the dog's life is anything but sad. Still the family and Marley will endear themselves to you and bring you in on their journey.Owen Wilson has always been more of a slapstick comedy kind of guy. I consider him a rather strange actor because he has a very odd voice and face and style to him. The film has to suit him somehow. Marley and Me wouldn't be the film I would think he'd be good for but he actually does pretty well. I still think he wouldn't have been my first choice for this particular role but he does pull it off. I wouldn't say he's great but he does the job. Jennifer Aniston fits the film a little more. Her style and girl-next-door look really works for the film and remarkably her and Wilson make an odd and yet decent couple. They have good chemistry although not fiery or anything. Grey's Anatomy co-star Eric Dane plays the womanizing best friend of Wilson. He does alright in the role but has a very small part and purpose to the story. Terrific actor Alan Arkin is also sadly underused as Wilson's boss.Director David Frankel's style really does shine through in the film. The director's Television work includes episodes of Sex and The City and last years hit The Devil Wears Prada. While both of those projects might be considered ""Chick Flick"" type but it also means he knows how to handle comedy, and emotion and a good story with solid characters. Marley and Me will touch you and it is just a fun and cute film. Invite the family, sit down and really enjoy this family movie that will likely be lasting beyond it's time. 8/10",Marley & Me
22,Lejink,Dog days and afternoons...,4,6 April 2010,"Putting aside my natural aversion to over-sentimental films involving A - pets, B - children, C - vacuous 30-somethings and D - Jennifer Aniston and partly as I've recently caved in to my wife and bought a cocker spaniel pup, (Hi Flip!), I acceded to my good lady's request on Easter Saturday evening that we watch this family entertainment movie over something a bit heavier and to be honest, putting all my in-built prejudices aside, it wasn't too hard to watch! There's really not much to say about the plot other than it's all about the interaction of yuppie couple Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston's lives' with a mischievous pup christened ""Marley"", after reggae great Bob, one of whose songs happens to be playing on the radio (let's just be grateful Frank Zappa wasn't on at the time!) who grows into the biggest mutt this side of Digby and triggers a series of comic incidents for the burgeoning family like all the best shaggy dog films there have ever been.There's a wholly redundant sub-plot on Wilson's blunted ambitions in journalism and a general re-enforcement of good old family values as his jealousy over his best-mate, footloose free-spirit, fellow-journalist Eric Dane, is turned on its head as the latter naturally ends up coveting the happy family unit that Wilson has built up, all of which helps take the film a good half an hour longer to get to its natural finish than it really should. At least said finish is surprisingly down-beat (the mutt doesn't make it folks!) and of course there's not meant to be a dry eye in the house as Wilson and his family bury the old pooch in their back garden and eulogise over their late pet's merits.It's all done very innocuously and amiably, with Wilson in particular coming across as a nice guy, gamely chasing Marley around everywhere and getting his face licked from all angles. Aniston is okay too, although I didn't get any physical sense that the couple were actually ageing, despite having three kids and moving home in the time-frame shown. Background music, as is typical for a film of this type, is pretty continuous and energetic, only mildly spoiling my viewing.I'll take it as a bonus too that there were only a couple of passing shots of a dog-turd and one fleeting flatulence joke too, perhaps indicating that the film was after all aimed as much at young parents as well as their offspring. I don't fit either profile, which would explain my low mark, but this was okay, easy-to-watch entertainment which I hesitate to criticise too harshly.",Marley & Me
23,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Misguided film meddling with elements of comedy and drama,4,27 September 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The Grogans (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston) are a middle class couple who want to have decent jobs and start a family. To get things rolling, they adopt a dog for a cut price...only to find out the reason for that with hilarious consequences, as Marley proves to be the most disorderly, out of control dog they could own. But over the years, they come to form a bond with him that will take them places they couldn't know.At first glance, this film, not the kind I'd usually be drawn to, seemed like an old fashioned sort of slapstick comedy, packed full of poop gags and the like. What has prevailed is more of a mawkish, sentimental sort of film where we see the couple raise a family over the years and see Marley grow from a puppy to an old dog, with elements of pathos thrown in to give it a more real life feel. It's moving enough, but the ending drags on a bit and Marley shows no real positive qualities, even for a dog, through out the film, so how they grow so attached to him is anyone's guess. We all know the pain of having an animal put down, though, and the ending, for all it's failings, makes us feel empathy with Wilson's character for this. **",Marley & Me
24,Edvis-1997,Review,8,11 November 2018,Pretty good movie/life story about a man and his dog. How he meets his girlfriend how they live together with doggie.

25,MLDinTN,just not that interesting: the dog really isn't the star,5,15 October 2009,"I thought this movie was disappointing. I was expecting Marley, the dog, to be the star, but the film was really more about John, played by Owen Wilson. Owen wasn't a good pick in my opinion. I have a hard time believing him to be a family man. Also Jennifer Aniston isn't who you think of as a mom of 3 kids. I think she was miscast also.The movie shows the two getting married and moving to Florida where they buy Marley. Marley tears up the house, chews on things, and is sort of like their baby. Eventually, they start having kids and this is when Marley gets shoved to the background. The rest of the film is just them having marital fights, making up, raising kids, and moving north. The movie ends with Marley's death, and the family reflects on the good times. It seemed to me that was stuck in there to try to convince people this movie was better than it was. Dogs should never die in movies, people don't want to see that.FINAL VERDICT: Not that good. I don't recommend it.",Marley & Me
26,gbill-74877,Arf,7,2 September 2019,"Incredibly cheesy for most of its run time, like a made for TV movie with nonstop contrived moments and dialogue, but god damn if this film doesn't make me emotional when we see the arc of Marley's life fully appreciated by the family who spent years busy living their hectic lives, and had been mostly annoyed with him.

28,slightlymad22,Not what I was expecting,8,20 September 2014,"Newly Wed couple Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are a perfectly happy couple. Until Wilson suspects Aniston wants a baby. To buy some time, he buys a puppy who they name Marley, since Bob Marley is playing in the car on the ride home. I'll admit from the off, that I am bias. I love Jennifer Aniston. With her gorgeous girl next door looks, great legs and what seem to be permanently erect nipples. I adore her, and will usually give anything she is in a chance.And that is why I watched ""Marley & Me"" Jennifer Aniston is looking cute, wearing a pair of cut off Denim shorts on the poster. That's not 100% true, I'd enjoyed Wilson in ""Armageddon"" ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Shanghigh Noon"" and I thought a family movie about a little rascal puppy could e perfect viewing for my me and my fiancée and our son (who was 8 when this was released). I didn't get the ""Beethoven"" style comedy, I was expecting. I got much more. This is a very touching movie about the worlds worst dog. I'll admit to shedding a tear whilst watching this. In fact out of the three of us watching this, it was my eight year old son who didn't cry. All the cast are great. Wilson is very likable as the man who is watching his life go by, as he makes plans. Of the supporting cast Alan Arkin is the stand out as Wilson's boss. As for Aniston, she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply.",Marley & Me
29,filipemanuelneto,A family movie more somber and serious than most.,4,18 June 2019,"This family film is based on the way a dog affects, touches and becomes an indispensable presence in the life of a family. In fact, the film is very beautiful and contains an affectionate message about the importance of animals in our lives. That is enough to make the film attractive to lovers of the genre, but anyone who does not have a particular appetite for family movies will probably find it too sugary or at least boring.Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are both competent in the two main human roles (the dog is the central character of the film, of course). I found the romantic chemistry of the two actors good and convincing, but the work developed by them seemed a little warm, good just for the kind of movie it is. Despite everything, and being a comedic film, it deals with very serious issues such as family relationships between parents, children and parents, postpartum depression, pain of loss and mourning. These themes not only make the film more serious than an ordinary family film as they have been reason enough for some parents not to show it to their children.I personally enjoyed the movie, but it's far from my favorite with regard to family movies. In fact, it is darker than most, but this does not seem to me as an impediment for young people (not smaller children, but those who have some maturity to understand things as they are) to see and understand the messages that it passes.",Marley & Me
30,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Rushed yet sweet, ""Marley"" avoids dog romantic comedy stereotype",7,4 May 2010,"""Marley & Me"" does not prey entirely on our soft side for dogs, nor does it aim for laughs caused by animal hi-jinx. It's a touching film with a warm spirit that manages to shake off any tearjerker stereotypes that most people would be quick to slap it with. That's better than at least 75 percent of current films with the labels ""romance"" and ""comedy"" associated with them.It tells the story of a dog, but ""Marley & Me"" is equally about the start of a family. The film covers a lot of chronological ground and quickly. John and Jenny (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Anniston) start the film married and an hour later have three kids and a dog. That dog would be Marley, a yellow lab the couple got on clearance when they were still wavering over whether to have kids. Marley is a terror of a dog when it comes to behavior, but ""Marley & Me"" never fully mutates from romance to dog shenanigans comedy. Writers Don Roos and Scott Frank refuse to cave in to making this a film about a crazy dog and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" director David Frankel supports them fully. When Marley has some kind of episode, it's quick and punchy, leaving only the effect that Marley adds to the struggle of making a family work.What neither Frankel nor the writers can overcome in adapting John Grogan's book, however, is the challenge of putting so much physical time into a two-hour film. They find a way, but the story rarely has a chance to breathe or take root in the mind because so much happens in the course of ten or even five minutes. Films that span a lifetime usually end up in the two plus time category for this reason. Consequently, Wilson and Anniston never seem to age. (""Jenn's held up well"" says Eric Dane, the best friend, to Wilson when they encounter each other toward the end of the movie.) Your empathy will grow for Marley, but the characters don't quite have enough time to germinate. Missing are the little moments that really show great character because the film is too busy passing through time.Both stars are at their best in ""Marley,"" with Wilson getting to be a toned-down and mature laid-back joker as opposed to an immature laid-back joker. Anniston gets to combine her romantic comedy quirkiness with the occasional flip-out as well, which she's executed numerous times before.I did have a personal beef with Wilson's character being able to support three kids and his stay-at-home wife on a journalist's salary (which is doubled at one point in the film), but the film is otherwise logical and transitions exceptionally well. Roos and Frank write in a number of clever montage alternatives that are attention grabbing. One such scene is Wilson doing voice over and reading single phrases one after the other about what is happening in his life and another shows how Marley torments the baby sitter as John and Jenn vacation to Ireland and Jenn's voice over is of the instructions they left behind.The family and dog elements blend in nicely, but missing from ""Marley & Me"" is some resonance. It all makes sense and sure, the dog was family and dogs love unconditionally, but the film leaves itself no time to show instead of tell about what Marley taught them. Another example of this is Jenn yelling at John about how difficult it is to watch their kids and Marley and how she never realized it would be so hard. The trigger is pulled too early with use of dialogue when some effectively drawn out scene writing would've captured that idea easily.Nevertheless, ""Marley"" remains a sweet-natured and likable if not lovable film that captures true moments of romance, family and pet ownership without ever giving in to a single convention that most ""dog comedies"" employ with reckless abandon.",Marley & Me

32,robert-temple-1,A Disappointing Dog Film,3,13 July 2009,"As a dog-lover, I always enjoy a good dog film. This one fails to make the grade. The producers seem to have thought that if they stuck the winsome and charming Jennifer Aniston into the film, she would provide the necessary quota of cuddly cuteness which the dogs themselves fail to deliver. Aniston succeeds, but the film is utterly disappointing. The people who made this film cannot be true dog lovers, because their dogs are treated as props. It is an insult to dogs. In fact, the dogs have been totally de-humanized! And that is the greatest insult which can be made to a dog. I admit I did not watch to the end, and maybe it all becomes very maudlin and moving by that stage. But they lost me. The male lead (I mean the human male lead) in this film is an incomprehensibly boring Owen Wilson. He lacks all charm. In fact, there is no way anybody as glam as Jennifer Aniston would look at a dork like that twice. He adds nothing to the film but additional yawns, which admittedly has a certain advantage when the brain is starved of oxygen, so perhaps that is why they cast him. Owen Wilson manages to keep you slightly, vaguely, awake while he is putting you to sleep. But the worst thing is that the dogs are mere accessories to a feeble story about boring humans, the dogs are not allowed to be themselves, are not given proper attention, their antics are not filmed adequately, and thus this film is not really a dog film at all, so to call it a failed dog film is thus to praise it too highly. All dogs should absolutely refuse to watch this film. As for humans, who cares.",Marley & Me
33,meeza,"Marley is the doggone hero of ""Marley & Me""",8,25 May 2009,"""Karly & Me"" is the story about a pseudo movie critic (yours truly) and his adoring wife Karly. Oops! Wrong narrative! ""Barley & Me"" is the story about my drunken escapades during my 20's. Oops! I did it again! Again, wrong narrative! ""Marley & Me"" is really the dog & money (it made millions at the box office) movie show about a married couple and their wreckful but adorable pooch Marley. Owen Wilson & Jennifer Aniston star as John and Jennifer Grogan. The film begins with the Grogans getting married in cold Michigan and then migrating to Miami in order get out of the fur in to another type of fur. The other type of fur would come in the form of little lab Marley, who they purchase as a clearance dog. Marley becomes an integral part of the Grogan life even though Marley is a one-dog terminator machine. The Grograns end up bearing three human two-legged humanoids of their own (yea, babies), and the complete & prototype All-American family is produced. But not without some barking issues: Ruff #1: John is a columnist who internally wants to be a New York Times Reporter like his single-living best friend Sebastian. Ruff #2: Marley causes havoc and destroys anything that does not move, not only in the Grogan household but in the neighboring community as well. Marley is a neighborhood dogwatch of another kind. Ruff #3: Jennifer goes through postpartum depression after the birth of Grogan baby number three, which causes some ""not so good"" non-dynamite times between the J.J.'s (John & Jennifer). And other ruff patches you will have to see for yourself. But in the end, The Grograns never ""let the dog out"" of their lives though good or bad times. Marley & Me's melancholy ending did definitely cause me to have a ""Hankey & Me"" condition, and I am sure to many others who have watched the film. Owen Wilson & Jennifer Aniston were just mediocre with their chemistry-lacking leading roles. Alan Arkin was fine though as John's news editor boss Arnie Klein. However, my favorite performance of the film was that of Eric Bane as Sebastian; Bane was the acting ""great dane"" of ""Marley & Me"". Director David Frankel was frank in providing this tale of a dog's affect on a family; but at times, to be frank with you, Frankel wagged too many tales with some dreary needless scenes. The same frank analysis could be said to Scott Frank's screenplay. However, the dog Marley is the ""one love"" of the film which will cause you to think ""Is this love that I am feeling?"" for ""Marley & Me"". **** Good",Marley & Me

35,MaxBorg89,Comedy or drama? Hard to decide,6,25 March 2009,"The main problem with Marley & Me is that the trailer suggests it's just another generic comedy, with two established comedy stars (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston) dealing with an occasionally troublesome pet. That, plus the presence of David Frankel - the director of The Devil Wears Prada and a bunch of episodes of Entourage and Sex and the City - seems to indicate it's gonna be 100 minutes of non-stop laughs. The problem is, anyone who has read John Grogan's autobiographical book on which the movie is based knows Marley & Me is meant to be something more. That something, unfortunately, is largely missing on the big screen.Sticking quite closely to the book's premise, the film shows newlyweds John (Wilson) and Jennifer (Aniston) dealing with their new life: house, job (they're both journalists), the whole nine yards. Too bad John is stuck with minor news items, while his colleague and friend Sebastian (Eric Dane) gets to cover the big stories. Then there's the inevitable baby issue, which gives John a ""brilliant idea"": in order to see if they are ready for parenting, they should get a dog, despite their complete lack of experience with pets (a detour from the book, since the real Grogan had a dog while growing up). And so a cute Labrador named Marley (after singer Bob) enters their lives and changes them radically: whereas most Labs are expected to be a bit lively, Marley is a genuine force of nature, generally ignoring rules, eating whatever he pleases and humping everything in sight. This might pose a problem when the actual kids start showing up (the Grogans eventually end up with three children), but somehow Marley proves to be the binding force of the family. Most importantly, he also turns out to be a gold mine for John, who receives heaps of praise from his editor (Alan Arkin) for the column covering his life at home.Sounds all delightful, doesn't it? Alas, there are some more dramatic aspects in the script, and the main problem is Frankel doesn't really know how to get the best out of those scenes. Kathleen Turner's cameo as a dog instructor, i.e. a funny bit? Piece of cake. Jennifer contemplating divorce at one point? Not so much. In all fairness, though, the problem does also lie with the actors: Aniston has no major difficulties with the sad moments, given she had plenty of those on Friends and always delivered; Wilson, on the other hand, seems rather lost in the non-comedic bits, despite his ability to pull off serious stuff convincingly when working with his friend Wes Anderson.Tone isn't the only problem, though: there are some huge plotting issues as well. Why, for instance, isn't the subplot about the Grogans' neighbors developed properly, instead of just popping up as a dramatic device? And is there any real significance to the Sebastian character besides having the usual womanizing male friend in the movie and therefore allowing Dane to do his Grey's Anatomy routine on the big screen? That the latter is quite entertaining doesn't justify it enough.Still, while it may suffer from a lack of focus, Marley & Me isn't all bad. As said earlier, the funny scenes are really funny, as are Wilson, Aniston and Arkin, and the sucker-punch ending manages to be moving despite Frankel's clumsy handling of all the other ""deep"" moments. Bottom line: it's all in the title, or at least part of it. Watch it for the dog, and maybe his crazy antics will be enough to distract from the picture's occasional failings.",Marley & Me
36,juneebuggy,"A heartwarming, feel good movie... if you shut it off just as the dog starts to get old",8,13 December 2014,"This is a decent adaption following a Philadelphia newspaper columnist and his wife who move to Florida and adopt a Labrador puppy that quickly turns their lives upside down. Marley's illicit behaviour continues over the years of job and home changes, as well as the challenges of a growing family.When I first heard that John Gorgan's bestseller was being made into a movie I can't say I was thrilled with the casting. I was mostly disappointed that Jennifer Aniston was going to play the wife and... she lived up to my initial disappointment. Owen Wilson (who I also had my doubts about) does a decent job as John though and Eric Dane was a nice surprise.Whereas the book was all about the dog with the people just on the fringes, the movie version is more about the family and its ups and downs over the years than Marley. Movie Marley also isn't nearly as ""bad"" as book Marley. Other than those couple of things and maybe the fact that they used a different dog in almost every scene, I enjoyed this movie a lot.In all honesty I've never seen the end of this, I always shut it off just as John starts to notice that the dog is getting old. Highly recommended as this will save you A LOT of heartache.

The intended audience is women who harbor deluded fantasies of how life should be.

In this ultra-cynical nonsense, the traditional White Bread Couple (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Anniston) decide to adopt a dog, Marley. The dog turns out to be a nightmare. In the real world where most of us live, the dog would be incredibly irritating. If you didn't end up shooting it, you'd end up depositing it on a farm somewhere where it could spend the rest of its days tearing up the fields and chasing livestock. In the world of this Hollywood product, Owen and Jennifer take a mostly laid back attitude to this psycho dog and behave totally selfishly when it's around others. For example, when Owen goes to visit an open house, he lets the dog run inside without a leash and plunge into the backyard pool -- even though he knows the dog is a big problem, he doesn't care that his dog may upset other people. That's the kind of guy he is. Unfortunately, such arrogant pigs -- who come with a smug smile -- are commonplace these days. Watching one on screen would be fun if he was being chased by people with knives! This thing is predictable and puerile. It knows its audience and it gives them the brainless pap they expect -- cute dog, cute kids, and a cute subplot about a guy (Wilson) who gets everything he wants, but still remains a self-centered whiner.

I expected a rather silly, but sweet and pretty much easily forgotten comedy. What else to expect from a movie that starred Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston and one of the dogs with the worst behavior in recent movie memory.Surprisingly enough it had another level in it. Many times it is the sweet and silly comedy, with many good laughs, but the story that evolves is much deeper than that. It is the story of the creation of a family. With love and sorrow, heartbreaks and happiness. All told from the perspective of John's (Wilson) and Marley's relationship.And perhaps the biggest fault lies in there too. For the story is clearly told from John's perspective, even though Jennifer's (Aniston) relationship to Marley is at least, if not even more, heartfelt and interesting. It seems it would have benefited to be told a little more from hers perspective.Otherwise it was a good comedy, with a little heart twist at the end.

Even thought the whole cast tries to be good, the plot--most of the time-- reveals to be wrong and cliché, showing a classical American life without any interesting circumstance. John and Jenny are an ordinary couple that change their lives after getting a dog-- that's cool, I agree. But the plot is simply pointless, since it's all about John complaining about his job-- just an insignificant subplot to get to the dog's death thing. I would not complain if there was an engaging subplot behind the dog's passing away, but it isn't the case. Other than that, I felt hardly thrilled when John said to Marley ""Let me know when you're ready, OK?""; that because I find it extremely sad to know someone you care about is going to die soon.

It is unfortunately a complete poser of a comedy - a fraud as far as that aspect. As a movie it's generically bland. Yes there are some cute lovable doggy scenes, but the tearing up of furniture is only amusing once as is most of the so-called gags which are expected. There's nothing really new here. The drama, misplaced, really doesn't work either as Owen Wilson seems stilted for pretty much his brand of comedy, which by the way seems stale.

41,bob-rutzel-1,We Were Misled,4,17 May 2009,"A young couple get married, move to Florida and get a dog that destroys almost everything in sight, including the marriage. This is based on a true story (so to speak).I thought this was going to be a nice family movie with an unruly dog. Lots of Laughs, Yuks and OMGs. It stated out that way and I was living large. Good comedy, lines and the dog was a joy to watch. And, this lasted for a long time while the family grew. Then the dog, Marley, got old with some medical problems. Gone were the laughs, yuks, and the OMGs and this turned into something less of a comedy and more of a death watch for Marley. Not good. We were misled. All the promos told us we were in for a comedy. Why would anyone ever think we would want to see a dog hang to life and then be put down because nothing medically could be done? Why indeed.Now, at the end of the movie, if the dog saved someone's life, got shot or something else and then died, wellwe could accept that. Oh, wait a minute, that would be fiction. This is supposed to be a true story. There was a good mix between the antics of Marley and the newlyweds, and of the marriage and growing pains between John Grogan (Wilson) and Jen (Aniston). Hence the title should not have been Marley and Me. How about Jen, Me and the Dog. The story was more about them, than the dog. Really. The dog was used to hook us into believing we would see a comedy all the way through. We were misled. Someone said they used 17 or 27 dogs in this. Hard to say which number is right as they sound so much alike.I do not think it is a good idea to let kids watch this, especially the last quarter of the movie. But, that is just me. If you do let them watch, bring the Kleenex box. You will all need it. Maybe two boxes. Yes, the picture of Marley as a puppy on the ads will draw the kids in. Know what you are getting for them. And, keep in mind that pets usually die before we do, and that is very sad because many pets are treated like family and rightly so. And, let me throw this in. If you really want to see a TRUE, yet very SAD movie, go see TAKING CHANCE. Because this ends up being a very sad story, I maintain we were misled.Did I give some things away? Yes, and rightly so. Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",Marley & Me
42,m-47826,Extremely disappointing movie for me.,3,18 December 2020,"The title makes no sense with what the movie really is about. It's a dramedy, with that indie flick approach. And the dog has close to no relevance to how the story unfolds. Except at the end, of course. To be honest, his bad behavior gets old really fast. One thing I noticed too, was how no dogs they picked for each stages, looked alike. It prevents us from believing it's the same one. The movie was decently entertaining, but not in a way that draws you in completely. I liked most of the actors and music, though. The ending would've been unexpected, if someone here didn't spoil it. Thank you for that...",Marley & Me

Chaos and irritating chaos at that; a dog that breaks and takes everything in sight isn't funny the first time and after the seventieth time it is just plain dire.Call me Mr Killjoy but we just could not find the heartwarming joy in this at all - we wanted the dog to run away - and for Jennifer Aniston and Luke Wilson to stop being phony.Definitely not for children this is a film for those who like their cruelty served up with a large dose of frustration.It says it all that is gets released post-Oscar; if it was meant for Christmas then Scrooge has won.Hated that we hated it all, but what is most depressing of all is that IMDb raters have become so lacking in taste and judgment....",Marley & Me
44,dunmore_ego,The Pursuit of Crappyness.,3,9 May 2009,"In the insensate family comedy, MARLEY & ME, a young couple (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston) buy a labrador puppy that we know the film wants us to regard as ""mischievous,"" ""lovable,"" ""cute,"" but which is, in reality, retarded, for when it grows to adulthood, it still has not learned one shred of discipline and cannot control its bladder or destructive nature.I guess dog lovers think this is funny? Like Hurricane Katrina was funny to New Orleans.Owen Wilson plays newspaper columnist, John Grogan (the same name as the author of the idiotic book of the same name - a special kind of conceit going on there, I'm sure); Jennifer Aniston is his writer wife, named... Jennifer, who is only a writer until it doesn't matter any more in the script.Grogan buys his wife a puppy, names it Marley after Bob, to distract her from wanting a child; ""something other than you that she has to take care of."" Dog then creates expensive, insensate havoc, mistaken for comedy by people who laugh at fart jokes: dragging restaurant tables, eating furniture, carpet, clothes, wrecking screen doors, breaking everything, eating Jennifer's necklace, barking incessantly, pissing and shitting wherever it wants to...That's the movie. The whole movie. Stupid dog destruction piled on stupid dog destruction, with human subplots thrown in to salvage a shred of interest. I suspect Alice Cooper would especially like the dead baby tangent (Jennifer has a miscarriage), and every man who was dragged to this movie by his puling girlfriend will at least get to ogle the bikini chicks who can't act.Dog-lovers will irrationally love MARLEY & ME - all other sentient humans will be edging for a slip of knocker from one of the bikini babes or Jennifer Aniston that will never come.MARLEY & ME is not in the least funny, although in some braindead alternate universe where people regard dogs as more deserving of life over their own primate species, it is hilarious.Alan Arkin, as Grogan's editor, provides the only levity, without even trying to - just Being Alan Arkin. Eric Dane is Grogan's successful journalist buddy, Sebastian (look up smug in the dictionary, there's a picture of this guy).Kathleen Turner as a dog trainer, in her first role since the sex change to Hunchback of Notre Dame.Movie tries to provide substance with Jennifer's failed pregnancy. But after she raises three healthy kids, we ask ourselves: What was the point of that sidetrack? Movie tries to contrast Sebastian's womanizing, globetrotting life with Grogan's fraying family rut. At one point, Jennifer is so frustrated with two babies and Marley destroying furniture and waking the babies, that she requests Marley's ousting. In saying the one sensible thing in the movie, she and Grogan get into a fight that spills over into their frustration with their lives. But no one forced them to spawn two kids. No one asked them to retain the retarded dog after its reason for distracting Jennifer became obsolete.I don't get it. And please DON'T try to explain it to me. I fail to see how this dog continually breaking things is funny. Who in their right mind would find this precious? The scariest part is, movie is lifted from the chronicles of the real life John Grogan and his havoc canine. So upon deduction, we realize the PEOPLE are the retarded ones. Just as kids are the products of their parents' upbringing (or lack thereof), so too must John Grogan assume the blame as either derelict in his duties of raising the dog properly, or soft in the head for tolerating the dog's erratic behaviour in the first place.MARLEY & ME gives us no reason to love its canine star. Towards the end, there is too little, too late, as Grogan gives an impassioned monologue on how Marley once stayed up with Grogan's sick kid for eight hours, as an example of Marley's love. You absolutely sure the dog was not waiting for the kid to die so he could eat it? Are dog-lovers so needy they will latch onto any animal that exhibits what they consider ""love"" towards them, when in reality it is obeisance towards the entity that provides them food and shelter? Grogan's last words, ""Give him your heart and he'll give you his"" are such a laboriously twisted spin on what we've just witnessed for the last 120 opprobrious minutes that we realize we are watching some kind of pathological study in denial. Evidently, a dog ""giving you his heart"" involves eating your furniture continually, pissing anywhere indoors, humiliating you in public, knocking over your kids, waking your babies, causing thousands of dollars of damage every week...and remaining untrained all its life until it dies.At Marley's deathbed, when Grogan declares his love for Marley, we realize that at no point in this ludicrous film did we ever feel that Grogan and his wife ever loved their kids as much as their mutt. And the dog only dies to shamelessly tug at the heartstrings of this film's demographic - the fart-joke lovers... Montage, manipulative music, the tears of children, platitudes - it's all here. And the dog-lovers eat it up like furniture.Pet-owning constitutes one of mankind's greatest arrogances anyway. It has nothing to do with love of animals or unselfishness or materal instincts; it is about - as Vincent Price once leered on an Alice Cooper record - the ""inborn need to dominate, possess""; the same reason zoos exist. Sebastian tells Grogan, ""You got a kid, you're a dad. You got a dog, you're a Master."" Okay - Movie, roll over and play dead.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Marley & Me
45,Pumpkin_Man,Cute Little Marley!!!,7,27 December 2008,"I just saw the movie an hour ago, and whenever my mind wonders to 'that scene' I'm still crying, even as I write this review. I'm an 18 year old and this movie made me cry like a baby! It's hard because we have a cute little yellow lab just like Marley. His name is Jazzy, and he's like a little brother to me. As I watched this, I thought of Jazz and all of his antics. Marley is so freakin' cute! We had a Samoyed that died two years ago and that's still sad for me, because she was like my little sister. Owen Wilson and sexy Jennifer Aniston did an awesome job. They adopt Marley and have to deal with his crazy misadventures. When Marley got older, he didn't seem like the main star. I loved all the trouble Marley got into. I was pretty much hyperventilating when it came to Marley's goodbye. It was extremely harsh to show his on-screen death, because that was not fair to dog lovers. They did take it too far for me. If you love dogs, especially yellow labs, I highly recommend MARLEY & ME!!!",Marley & Me
46,Sirus_the_Virus,"A sad, great dog film.",9,10 October 2009,"Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston star in Marley & me. Let me just say, It is very sad. I don't cry, I didn't cry in this film, but I sure was close. I was a fan of the book, liked it, and wanted to see the film. I read the adult version of the book. There are three versions of the book. The adult version, a young adult version, and a picture book. I read the adult version. I was a big fan.Wilson and Aniston star as The Grogans, a recently married couple. When they get a Golden retriever named Marley, he wreaks havoc. John and Jenny Grogan live their lives with Marley the dog and experience many things with him.Marley and Me is a sweet film. It will have most people tearing up, on the inside and on the outside. It's sad watching this movie, I am not going to spoil anything. But really it's not a spoiler because in most films with a dog, the dog_ _ _ _. I think you can fill in the blanks. It won't come as a surprise. Marley & me is heartwarming and funny. Thumbs up.",Marley & Me
47,fwomp,Who Cried When Ol' Yeller Got Shot?,7,2 May 2009,"Who cried when Ol' Yeller got shot? Come on. Admit it. You did, didn't you? I cried my eyes out. So it shouldn't surprise many that this film (and the book it is directly based on) can get that lump started in your throat and make your eyes well-up.The correlation between being a pet owner is strong. Most of us probably had a dog when we were growing up and that poor mongrel must've meant a lot. We always remember the name of our first dog-love. We played with 'em, fed them, and watched them grow old and die. It is a powerful moment in all our lives to witness the death of a beloved friend, be him human or not.So MARLEY & ME drills right to the core of that relationship. I don't fault the writer or director for using this type of ploy. It gets the audience seriously involved at an emotional level. Have two wannabe parents decide on their first dog (Marley). Raise him along with themselves, their careers, and their children. Watch him terrorize and destroy your home, your privacy, your car (insert laughs), and then have him slow down as he begins to gray. Finally, the decision comes: what to do with the old guy when he can't raise himself onto his feet anymore. Watching kids say goodbye to him will be the highest emotional point for most film viewers; I can feel that old knot starting in my throat already! The great thing about the film is that it does touch on those memories we have. I have such great ones of my first dog that I broke out some pictures and looked at them after watching Marley & Me. But it didn't make me want to buy another one. I don't own a dog and don't want one. They do exactly what Marley does: they die on you.The downside to the film is that it is completely predictable and only so-so acted. Much of the book is incorporated so lovers of the novel will probably cheer about that. But there were some edits, obviously. The only one that bugged me was when Marley and owner John Grogan (Owen Wilson, CARS) went to find out about a crime in their neighborhood which eventually made John and his wife Jennifer (Jennifer Aniston, THE BREAK-UP) decide to move to another, safer area (in the book this is pretty well spelled-out but in the movie it isn't clear why they move).Still, the movie is a good diversion with plenty of heart-string tugging that'll make you travel down your own doggy memory-lane.",Marley & Me

49,Danusha_Goska,Mediocre and Unconvincing,5,3 January 2009,"""Marley and Me"" is a cute enough, TV-sitcom quality movie. I love dogs, and I've been lucky enough to interact with many dogs in my life and this movie did not speak to me about the real relationships I've had with real dogs. Marley seemed more like a souped-up, cartoon version of a dog than any real dog.While watching the movie, I never forgot that Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston were the stars. In every scene, I was looking at Owen Wilson, rather than John Grogan, the character Wilson was meant to be playing. Owen Wilson, the famous slacker-star with the long, dyed blond hair and notorious recent tabloid headlines. Aniston tries harder to depict a character, rather than to just be her character Rachel from ""Friends"" all over again, but her hair and make-up, so like that of Jennifer Aniston the sitcom star, rather than any real-life housewife and mother of three, never let me forget that this was Aniston.Wilson's refusal to even attempt to disappear into his role seemed self-involved, and, maybe for that reason, I never believed that Marley, the dog, had any significance to Wilson at all. I just did not believe that there was a bond there. Wilson and the yellow labs playing the very exaggerated role of Marley just seemed like big-ego stars fighting over screen time and good shots during the tear jerking scenes.Marley was more of a cartoon of a dog than any dog I've ever known. Dogs want to please their masters and a good master forms a working and workable relationship with a good dog. Marley eats the Grogan's furniture and tears their blinds off their windows on a daily basis. This is just not believable and not funny. If a dog were to behave that badly, it doesn't speak well for the dog's owner.If you really want to see a great film about dogs, skip this and see the PBS Nature two-hour production, ""Dogs that Changed the World."" It is breathtaking, inspirational, and really tear-jerking. Real dogs form real bonds with real people and perform amazing feats, from herding sheep to detecting cancer.",Marley & Me

Marley barks at visitors, cowers during thunderstorms, chews up anything he can get in his mouth, and chases pigeons on the beach, in addition to being the ultimate babe magnet. Nothing groundbreaking here, but it's an entertaining film with plenty of laughs and even a tear or two along the way. Wilson and Aniston have a nice chemistry together and there are a couple of effective supporting turns from Alan Arkin as John's boss and best friend, but it's marley's picture all the way, and trust me, you will be in love with this dog by the time the film rolls around to its OLD YELLER-type conclusion.",Marley & Me

I've been there several times over the years when it was time to put down pet cats and dogs. They captured the moment with honesty and integrity and I was wiping away tears before I knew it.Every pet owner faces this inevitable moment, unless their pet gets lost or gets hit by a car or something,and that's just as bad. The movie should have focused more on the dog.Instead, the focus was on Jen and Owen. Neither of these actors can act. Wilson seemed to be on tranquilizers, unable to show appropriate emotions. Jennifer Aniston did what she always does - walk around acting like she's gorgeous. She's really not, though - just average-looking. Alan Arkin was over-the-top as Owen's nice boss. ""I'll double your salary""...""Take a week off - no! - a month!"" ...He did everything for Owen Wilson's character except pack his lunch in the morning. There was no character development for the dog. Just a destructive menace with no endearing qualities. It was disturbing how they never disciplined him or kept him on a leash.

But once it started to play on HBO and I watched it, it was not what I was expecting it to be. Sure, the dog is a very mischievous dog who causes a lot of havoc. But I thought it was going to be something lame like the movie Beethoven.The story is about the dog but it's also about a couple(Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston) and their story of building a family together. The movie takes place over several years and goes from them having no kids to having 3 by the time the movie is over with.It still probably isn't a movie I'd go see at the movie theatre but it's not a movie I'm ashamed to watch whenever it shows up on one of the movie channels.",Marley & Me
54,LazySod,"Bad trailer, OK film",7,6 May 2009,"This films' trailer does not cover the load: the trailers show a couple and their dog - and the trouble that comes from it as the dog is a little much to handle. Although it is true that this film starts out as that it surely does not end as that. The story starts up a little slow as the couple gets together and starts to make plans for the rest of their lives. When the dog is introduced into the family the speed picks up and there are some fun moments where the dog plays the best and most interesting part and there is a good amount of laughter as everything starts falling apart - literally. After that part the film takes a bit of a turn and starts going into a slow drive through family lane as the couple grows older, has kids and what not, with the dog as the red line through it all.All in all, not too bad but the twist makes that the trailers to be more or less deceptive. This might work against some of the audience, although I must admit for myself I found the film to be a lot better than what I had expected - apart from the very slow first twenty minutes it really was not half bad. The film is all about family values and the way a pet becomes a full flexed family member and that is precisely how I see things too - as a person that has 6 cats in the household. The different roles are played out well enough and the events that happen are normal enough to make for a true life.7 out of 10 barks and tears",Marley & Me
55,shark-43,What A Dog!,4,22 May 2009,"I know how passionate dog lovers are about cute dogs in movies but I am sorry - just because they have cute puppies and cute dogs throughout does not mean it is a good film and MARLEY & ME is an awfully made movie. Terrible. There is no chemistry between anyone in the film - humans OR animals. I can see why Owen Wilson was using hard drugs during the making of this and why he was suicidal afterwards. And yes, I know dog lovers don't see a problem with Marley's behavior but it was totally out of control so they were inadequate dog owners - they should never have had a dog - it tore up everything - always - knocking down the kids. The writing was lazy - just having scenes happen because it was time for them to happen - nothing was ever earned - oh - look the kids are all grown up now into one-dimensional things to hug and pet the dog but who are these kids? Why should we care about their sadness and angst when they are just stock characters - I love how just because the daughter is born last - she gets the shortest shrift - hey look it's the 3rd kid so you get three lines. It did show the reality of a growing family and the pressure it can put on the marriage but that was the only thing that rang true. And I know Eric Dane works all the time but this is the first thing I ever saw him in and he is so wooden I thought he was a tree. Nothing going on in the eyes - it's like he and Owen Wilson were having a contest to see who could be most dead-eyed. Alan Arkin looked bored and he hardly ever just phones in a performance but he did here. Aniston and Wilson looked uncomfortable around each other - Aniston looked uncomfortable around the dog the whole time - just pasted together crap with a few cute dog montages. Frankel is a good director but I guess he's only as good as his material (like Devil/Prada).

How can you not when a ten year old boy is crying when he knows he's saying goodbye to Marley? Jeez, I'm getting all emotional again just writing about it, and I didn't even care for the film very much! I didn't read the book, but based on the movie only, Marley didn't seem like a very lovable dog to me. You had the husband and wife owner who didn't provide any discipline or structure to the dog, so therefore it ran amok, did pretty much whatever it wanted, and we were supposed to think it's cute. I kept thinking of the TV show on Animal Planet (Maybe it's called, ""It's Me or the Dog""?) where they have to bring the British Woman in to teach the adults how to train and discipline their dogs. Marley definitely needed a dose of that! And yes, I grew up in a house with dogs and am a dog lover.

He flunks obedience school, chews off dry-wall, takes a bite out of the sofa, overturns garbage cans, steals a Thanksgiving turkey, consumes pillows and flowers, drinks toilet water, and chases the UPS guy. Even a newly-purchased, expensive necklace isn't safe from Marley's voracious antics.Amidst the mayhem he generates through the years, Marley sees the Grogans through the ups and downs of family life, through job and home changes, and most of all, through the myriad challenges of a growing family.

Even the naming of the dog, I am sure had people shaking their heads , thinking thats how they named their pet. Owen Wilson did his best acting . In a somewhat serious role , I felt this was even better than the job he did in 'The Minus Man'. Alan Arkin was fine in his supporting role, as he usually is. I have seen better from Aniston but she was OK. The film really captured how the family dog is a member of the family.The movie also explored , the everyday life going on and life changes with the addition of 3 children , gradually. Major life changes , of course. Marley always in the thick of things .I think it should, 'almost' be required to see this film before one gets a pet , particularly a dog.

64,arieliondotcom,Masterful Memories,8,11 October 2009,"I have dreaded seeing this movie since I first heard about how it ends after being very excited seeing the deceptively funny ads. I have a male lab that looks a lot like Marley (but much better, of course...heh-heh). My dog, Aslan also ate the car. No answering machines but he did chew the electrical sockets off the back of the house. When my TIVO auto-recorded it I decided to face my fears and watch it anyway. As a macho Italian I didn't want to see it in a theater because I knew I would cry. I even fast- forwarded & watched the ending first. I cried then cried the second time as well, hugging Aslan. I made that same decision about The Passion of the Christ when it came out, watching it at home where I could sob openly. At the risk of sounding blasphemous, I realized another similarity and that is, whom or what is the master of our lives & priorities? The star of this movie is NOT the dog, and not the author, but the author's relationship priorities. He begins a man realizing he is blessed by life in surprising ways throughout life. He gets a puppy in an attempt to keep his new wife distracted from childbirth so his priorities will remain reasonably intact. Through the surprising actions of the dog & life, his priorities change beyond himself, beyond the dog, to the family the dog helped found.Some of life's surprises are sad ones & the movie shows that. It didn't pull out a new furry happy ending as I hoped either. You'll cry. Period. Man or woman, you're gonna cry. But you'll also come away with a new appreciation for life and love even in canine form. And the realization that the only true priority in life should be love & relationships. Being taught that by a dog is only the training wheels to lead us to others. And, in my thinking though there's nothing religious in the movie, to our Master, GOD Who taught us love through obedience by death on a cross. I took off two stars because, having diverged from the expected funny happy ending story it tries too hard to ride the fence and not go too deep either. So it doesn't hit enough coloratura contrast. But it is worth watching because of what lessons and fun it does offer for Marley (and Aslan) and me.",Marley & Me

66,bazmitch23,Dull,1,21 September 2013,"Throughout this movie, I keep on checking the timer on my Blu Ray player. This film just seems to go on forever. I kept thinking ""When is this film going to end?""Owen and Jen play the same characters they always do. So does Alan Arkin. Need an old guy who's rude and says whatever he wants? That's him.I didn't think this movie was funny. Most of the jokes are just the dog taking a dump. And did we really need to see an extreme close up on a dog turd? With sweetcorn in it? What kind of dog eats sweetcorn?We've seen too many films about dogs misbehaving. It's getting tiresome.Owen's character writes articles. And what articles does he write about? His private life. Yeah, he puts everything from his private life into a news paper (or magazine, I can't remember) for everyone to see. Every single thing. This is just like Facebook and Twitter where everyone puts their own private information for everyone to see.And the worst part is his wife is okay with it.Yeah. She's fine with her husband putting their own private information about themselves so that the whole public knows. Yeah.The scene where they go to Ireland just made me want to vomit. It's typical Hollywood version of Ireland where the interiors and clothes look like they're from the 1800's.Yeah, it's like everyone in Hollywood's version of France is dressed in striped jumpers and carries baguettes. Also, the title is called ""Marley and Me"" when really it's about 2 people and dog. It should be called ""Marley and Us.""A really boring comedy with no laughs.",Marley & Me
67,gregeichelberger,A dog of a film - in a very good way,7,29 December 2008,"I'll be the first one to admit I'm a dog lover. In fact, during my early past lives history, I've been a pup many times.I've also never been a cat lover, but I wish felines no harm. It's just that my nature is like a mongrel; playful, sloppy, romping and loyal (I'm also a Taurus, after all) to a tee.So with all of these attributes, it's natural that I would have more than a few good things to say about the newest family film release, ""Marley and Me,"" starring Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, which is based upon the best-selling book by John Grogan.Wilson and Aniston play John and Jennifer Grogan, newspaper reporters in South Florida and newlyweds. Instead of having children right away, though, the couple decides to experiment first by raising a floppy golden Labrador pup named ""Marley"" (so called because a Bob Marley song was playing on the radio of John's car).They should have gone with twins.Marley is a one dog destruction machine, eating them out of house and home, chewing everything that doesn't move, having amorous relations with any leg around, whining loudly when alone or during thunder storms and just generally running amok.Marley practically destroys the house and everything in it. And when children finally come along, he causes Jennifer to forcefully demand his removal.Of course, even though the family continues to grow, John does not want to get rid of the dog, which continues to be a nuisance, but is also fiercely loyal and protects the children from harm.Anyone who has experienced the life span of a canine can certainly relate to this picture. Sure it's manipulative to a fault, not just tugging, but grabbing at the heartstrings on several occasions. But it's also funny, silly, frustrating and heartwarming at the same time .Wilson and Aniston are appropriately low key as the overwhelmed pet owners and parents, while Oscar-winner Alan Arkin (""Little Miss Sunshine"") adds some great support as John's gruff but soft-hearted editor.Also look for Kathleen Turner in a hilarious cameo as an obedience trainer who has no luck whatsoever with Marley.In addition, ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Eric Dane does a nice job as John's friend and co-worker, Sebastian. While John toils as a local columnist, Sebastian gets the meaty stories and is soon hired by ""The New York Times."" Meanwhile, John is moved from the general assignment desk to a daily column, much of which Marley provides fodder for.Beware, though. For awhile this picture threatens to turn into a latter-day version of ""Heartburn"" (1987) with the shift more on the married couple's domestic squabbles as the dog seems to disappear into the background.But thankfully those sequences do not overwhelm the purpose of the story  for very long at least.Overall, the movies is fine fare. And while some tears may flow and a few lumps could appear in some throats, ""Marley and Me"" is a perfect family film for this time of year.",Marley & Me
68,leighabc123,This Movie Went From Silly To Serious and Sad,5,22 October 2009,It is rare that a movie has so many turning points. It started out with a man and his newlywed wife adopting a cute little puppy for $200. The breeder obviously knew there was something wrong with him. That is why he cost less money. He was named Marley after Bob Marley. He was a hyperactive out of control dog who was afraid of thunder. A dog lover is driven crazy by him. Even obedience school couldn't help him. Then the guy's wife has a miscarriage. She wants to get rid of Marley. Then they eventually have three children. Then she starts to like Marley. Then Marley gets sick. Everyone is upset. Then Marley has to be put asleep.,Marley & Me
69,paudie,Pretty uneventful movie,5,9 March 2010,Possibly the most uneventful film I've ever seen! A couple get married and get a puppy who quickly grows into a large unruly adult labrador. The dog causes a few mildly embarrassing moments. The man gets a good job in a newspaper writing about a column that turns out to be mostly about his adventures with the dog. After a bit of tragedy they start a family. The kids grow up to love the dog too. He gets a better job and they move into a bigger house. They conclude that having a dog is a good thing. That's about it. Maybe a dog owner would have enjoyed it more. Wilson and Aniston do the best they can with pretty limited material but the movie is neither a drama or a romantic comedy. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the book it is based on.,Marley & Me
70,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A movie that will make you laugh and cry.,7,11 January 2009,"Maybe this should have been called 'What to expect when your expecting a dog'. This movie was funny, cute, romantic and at times completely heart breaking. Based on the newspaper column, Marley & me is a funny movie that Tuggs at the heartstrings but there isn't much more.This movie is a dog movie and that is exactly what you get. If you enjoy watching dogs create mischief then Marley & Me is for you. But this movie doesn't just offer naughty dogs. It has a little love story on the side.This movie is extremely realistic. It shows what happens when you get a dog. It shows the changes that a dog can cause and it shows the emotional part of having a dog. I recommend it. But don't expect the best movie of the year. All you will get is a nice comedy that only works on the first viewing. Be prepared for this movie to take a while. It runs at 111 minutes which can get a bit boring. I give Marley & Me.....7/10",Marley & Me
71,jemps918,Skip the mascara..,8,10 February 2009,"Gee, I hadn't cried in a really long time till I saw Marley & Me. It has no strong plot, but it will make you laugh and cry all the same.Director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) interprets Hollywood's latest book-to-movie offering, American journalist John Grogan's autobiography Marley & Me, a humorous account of 13 years of his family's life spent with their Labrador retriever, Marley.After writers John (Owen Wilson) and Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston) get married, they decide to have a dog first before having kids. They name him Marley, and he hilariously ensures who's alpha dog in the Grogans' home. Wilson does well in this semi-serious role, and has good chemistry with Aniston, who just looked a bit too good even for the parts where she was supposed to already look frazzled. Grey's Anatomy's Eric Dane takes on another playboy role as John's friend Sebastian, who lives out John's dream in a parallel universe, so he probably just ran on auto-pilot. It was shocking to see Kathleen Turner as the harassed dog trainer Ms. Kornblut; I can't believe she agreed to do such a non-glam role. Alan Arkin was wonderful as John's poker-faced but supportive editor Arnie Klein. Their scenes were restrained but memorable, and when Arnie tells John, ""Sometimes life has a better idea"", you can't help but apply his wisdom to yourself, too. Considering the thin plot, and knowing how it will eventually play out in the end (even without having read the book), the movie drags on a bit too long. Although, anyone who's ever lost a dog will undoubtedly relive the tragedy through this movie, so it's definitely emotionally engaging. It really is true: ""A dog doesn't care if you're rich or poor, educated or illiterate, clever or dull. Give him your heart and he will give you his."" A must-see for doglovers of all ages!",Marley & Me
72,RichardSRussell-1,Best film of the holiday season,9,26 December 2008,"Short-attention-span synopsis: Best film of the holiday season.Marley & Me (PG, 2:00)  9I felt bad having to deliver the news to my fellow fans about what a poor crop of SF&F films we have to pick from this holiday season, so let me make it up to you by giving a totally unqualified recommendation for Marley & Me! It's not science fiction. Heck, it's barely fiction at all, since it's drawn from the real-life experiences of newspaper columnist John Grogan, his wife Jen, their kids, and their yellow labrador retriever, Marley, ""the worst dog in the world"".I do some database work for the Wisconsin Academy of Graduate Service Dogs, and I have to say that Marley would have washed out of the academy in 15 minutes. He'd be a terrible service dog, but he makes a wonderful friend.This film is utterly realistic. It never strikes a forced or false note. There are lots of laffs, but they all arise organically out of real life. John and Jen are good, decent people (like virtually all Americans), and they behave naturally, without any visible ""acting"". It's a little slice of Americana. If a big-budget spectacular like Benjamin Button had been able to muster a quarter of the heart of this modest film, they'd already be rolling Oscar's red carpet up to its front door.""I'd like to be the man my dog thinks I am."" -- Mike McGuire, songwriter",Marley & Me
73,L_Copa,A good family movie !,7,14 February 2020,"The duo Jennifer Anniston and Owen Wilson is really good for a family friendly movie! But don't get it mistaken, this is an extremely emotional , happy movie which is gonna take you up and down and will crush you in the end. Not only acting is good but the dog is sweet to the whole story. A true portrayal of a common family and their journey. This movie might touch you deeply or nothing at all... It is up to the viewers eye and their personal experiences to connect with the story. Dont miss it.",Marley & Me
74,ArizWldcat,"Go ahead and go, a few tears aren't going to make you melt!",8,2 February 2009,"Since I am a ""dog person"", I knew I HAD to see this movie, and thought my kids (ages 13 and 18) wanted to see it as well, but it was a hard sell. They knew the inevitable ending and didn't want to sit through that. But, as you know this is actually how ALL life ends...death. Just go in, knowing that Marley does not turn out to be the only dog in the world who never dies! There! I said it. Hope I didn't spoil it too badly for you.I haven't read the book on which this movie is based, but I think I will now! The way John Grogan and his wife are portrayed in the film is quite real. I appreciated that the two of them arrive in Florida in an old rusty Honda (they were from Michigan, after all, where all the old cars have rust on them), and it takes a few years for them to be able to afford a home in a decent neighborhood.Of course, when the credits roll, you would have to be a completely cold person to not be sniffling. Just be sure you have plenty of Kleenex. It would have been nice on the part of the theater if they'd left the lights down until all the credits had rolled...just so we could all collect ourselves!

He wasn't quite like THIS dog, but some of the issues that the stars encountered were things I could relate to and the writer of the book that encountered this dog in real life stumbled onto a gold mine when it led to his job (I noticed that Owen Wilson's character has the same name as the author of the book this movie was based on). Keeping up with a dog is worse than keeping up with a baby, because this BABY can learn to walk a lot sooner than an actual human baby can.My hat's off to the writer of this book, and the animal trainers of this film, who I thought did an exceptional job bringing this animal to life.8 out of 10 stars.",Marley & Me
76,Craig_McPherson,"Decent, but fails to capture the magic of the book",5,7 January 2009,"Based on Philadelphia Inquirer columnist John Grogan's 2005 book by the same title, Marley & Me makes an admirable attempt to capture the magic of Grogan's life with an incorrigible Labrador retriever, but falls well short of the mark.This isn't to say that Marley & Me fails as a movie, but instead falls into that category of films adapted from literature that don't stack up. Whereas Grogan's book had the luxury of being able to tell a protracted story and draw the reader into the head and heart of the author while enrapturing the reader with Marley's antics, condensing a story that spanned years into a two hours and expecting it to work was clearly too much to ask.Looking beyond this shortcoming, however, and critiquing the movie on a standalone basis Marley & Me delivers a mixed bag with some elements working  particularly for those who are dog lovers or worse, like myself, who once owned a dog that was the spitting image of Marley. It also suffers from an identity crisis, splintering its focus between Grogan's private life, aspirations as a journalist, struggles with fatherhood and, of course, Marley, all of which were covered in the book without the constraints of being compressed into a sort of cliff-notes version, as happens here. Director David Frankel (The Devil Wear's Prada) further compounds the matter by inserting an insufferably long passage in which entire chapters of the book are sped through at a blistering rate for an overly prolonged stretch making for one of cinema's most aggravatingly overdrawn sequences.Both Wilson and Aniston do an admirable job in their respective roles and are the least of the movie's problems, although it could be argued that choosing unknowns for the parts would have allowed the audience to focus more on the story (such as it is) and Marley.If you're a dog lover, particularly one with an affinity towards Labs or other large rambunctious breeds, Marley & Me will be like sitting down to two hours with a good and loyal friend. For those that haven't read the book, be forewarned. The story takes you through Marley's life from awkward puppy to final moments, and will leave you misty-eyed, which, I suppose, is a good thing because the final pages of Grogan's book left me a complete weeping mess.",Marley & Me
77,paul_3-960-896774,Nice family drama with a comedic touch,6,18 January 2015,"﻿The first time I saw this movie I wasn't transcended by it. I thought it was a dog movie and I'm not much of a dog person. But after matching the movie recently, I saw it differently.It's not just about the dog, it's about the family, this couple and their kids' lives with Marley - the dog. Once I started to realized that it became a better movie. The changes and sacrifices John & his wife made spoke to me. I am older now and the film is much more about this couple's life, their careers, and family life for me than their dog's.Marley is just one of the focal point of the story that allow us to see the impact he had and how this family evolved with him around. The movie has a comedic element to it but back when I first saw and even now I did not burst out laughing, at best I chuckled. It's a better family drama than it is a comedy.I cannot say that the cast's performance was bad because a lot of the movie is focused on the dog. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are basically supporting a dog that has the main role. And I am not going to comment on dogs acting. Their individual performance have its moments but it's mostly forgettable. In fact, before watching it again - it was on TV for the holidays, I did not chase it - I knew Aniston & Wilson were in it but only remembered what the dog did. ﻿Marley & Me﻿, is a nice family movie that young kids might like and that can speak - to a certain level - to adults whether they are dog owner/lovers or not.Tweet me @wornoutspines",Marley & Me
78,jaddison383,This one sneaks up on you...,7,21 May 2009,"The advertising for Marley & Me set me against it, I'm not gonna lie. I didn't know much about it, except that it was about the ""worst dog in the world"" who was, of course, actually the best. The trailers made it seem like a not particularly funny money-making vehicle for the two stars in need of a hit.Well, they got a hit at the box office, as was expected, but what I didn't expect was how much I would enjoy the movie. It's true, Marley & Me is about the dog, but it's also about a man and his family, and their realization that life can't be planned. The ample talents of Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston certainly help the movie along, but this really was surprisingly good. The dog goes through all the major changes of their lives with them, and as we watch the journey as well we don't quite realize how caught up in it all we are until the very end. It's not a particularly fast-moving movie, and it is silly, but somehow the whole thing pulls itself off very well. It kept me entertained the whole time, that's for sure, and by the end it's clear how much the movie's actually meant to us; don't be too surprised to feel a tear forming in the corner of your eye. It's a credit to the filmmakers as well that the whole thing never seems too sappy to take. The supporting cast (Eric Dane, Alan Arkin, Kathleen Turner) were all good as well.So take a chance on Marley & Me. I know that this one never looked any good, but trust me: It's worth your time. Sit back, relax, and enjoy! 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",Marley & Me

I think is the perfect movie to be watched for couples at movie theaters because in that way they will enjoy more it between other people (especially the laughing parts). John and Jennifer Grogan are a couple who are having problems to have children that's why John buys a dog (Marley) so Jennifer can express her maternal feelings.

83,Jim-500,Still waiting...,5,20 August 2010,"... for something to happen. Really, nothing of importance happens in this film until 90 minutes have gone by. The next 20 minutes are moving but predictable, and then the movie is over.No drama, no tension, no laughs. It's simply the story of a family and their dog going through typical things that families with dogs go through: torn pillows, jumping up, bathroom accidents. I kept thinking, anyone who has ever had a dog could have written this screenplay. I saw nothing creative at all. The family does go through changes like babies and new jobs, but there is no drama attached to these things. They just happen, and life continues. Funny how this movie makes momentous events such as these seem mundane.And why is it called Marley & Me? I know the ""Me"" is Owen Wilson's character, but it seemed to me that Jennifer Aniston was just as much a part of Marley's life as he was. My guess is that the book dealt more with the male character than the movie did.It's a warm enough movie, but if you're looking for an interesting story or plot, there is none. It's a bland, plain-vanilla flick. About an hour in, something awful happens, but not to Marley or his family. And the event serves no purpose other than to move the family to another home, which they could have done anyway. And sadly, the person to whom this tragedy happens is not seen again; it's as if their only purpose in the movie was to get hurt and then thrown away.I think the idea was that through it all, the one constant thread was Marley. But while that's a good notion, it didn't make the movie interesting. It seems an oxymoron that a movie in which nothing happens could be predictable. I was trying to compare it to something I already know, and I came up with the Brady Bunch. But no--the Brady Bunch was more interesting.",Marley & Me
84,Matti-Man,Just trying to be objective,1,9 August 2009,"I find it astonishing that the first couple of screens of reviews of this film come down to ... if you like dogs you like this movie, and if you hate this movie you must hate dogs. Nonsense! I grew up with dogs. Indeed they do become part of the family, but the dogs I grew up with were so ill-trained that they exhibited all the same behaviour as Marley, here. And it's really hard to like a badly-behaved dog.Someone once said, there are no bad dogs, only bad owners, and this is amply illustrated both my MARLEY AND ME and my own life experience. In this respect, the movie reminded my of why I don't have my own dogs (or other pets) as an adult.So what we have here is a badly behaved dog - which is really hard to like - saddled with immensely likable but ineffectual owners. And this results in a movie that's very tough to like. On any level.Even then, it might've been saved if the script had been witty or had something worthwhile to say, but as has been noted by other reviewers here, it's just a checklist of scenes of Marley causing chaos which is all that's on offer in the way of comedy.Much as I like both Anniston (Brad, what were you thinking of?) and Wilson, I struggled to find any scrap of entertainment or enlightenment in this tragic waste of time and talent.",Marley & Me
85,dmasursky,Huge disappointment,5,13 April 2009,"For starters, it's way too much ""Me"" and not nearly enough Marley - all the scenes from the previews, with the dog being adorable and causing trouble, come from the first half hour of the movie. After that, the dog is barely present - the movie is about the people - their jobs, their miscarriage (!), their sex life (!), their kids, their marriage difficulties, their career-driven friend, their move from Florida to Philadelphia. The dog reappears toward the end so that he can get old and die. This movie is NOT for kids - mine were bored for most of it and then VERY upset at the end. I feel cheated - this movie was completely mismarketed. I'm sure the book is a terrific read, for ADULTS, and the movie should have been presented for that audience.

87,jantoniou,"Charming, thoughtful - probably not what you'd expect",8,3 January 2009,"Though I wasn't quite sure what to expect with ""Marley and Me"", I admit I basically expected it to be a slightly goofy slapstick type comedy centered around a high-strung pooch. I was thinking ""Beethoven"" just replace the St. Bernard with a Labrador.With ""A-list"" players like Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson involved, however, I should have known better.This is an actual movie - a real story about real life and the dog that runs through it (literally and figuratively).The basic story follows Wilson and Aniston as journalists who embark upon their lives as a married couple. Marley comes early on as the puppy no one wants and the marginally insane high-strung pooch who appears throughout to be virtually untrainable (don't tell that to that ""It's Me or the Dog"" gal). Shredding cushions, destroying floors and walls and most everything in between seems to never quite drive them completely mad. Instead of taking him to the pound they soldier through and love their dog and of course he faithfully loves them in return. Like a child, a pet is not someone you just give up on because they are hard to take care of.Children - three, ultimately - come into their lives and John's (Wilson) career continues to advance as he carves a niche as a local columnist. They ultimately move from Florida to Pennsylvania. Even as the marriage has its ups and downs, as Jen (Aniston, sans a character name change) gives up her career to be a mom, as kids are born and grow older, as John struggles with his own career direction Marley remains the constant, always a little crazy, always infusing his peculiar personality into the family dynamic.This is a ""family movie"" in the truest sense - that is, that it is about family, about the reality of being a father, a husband, a wife, a mother, and the obligations and dreams and ambitions we have and often let go for the sake of the greater purpose of raising our children. It is about uncomfortable and often painful sacrifices of our own vision of the future for ourselves and our family. It is about what we give up to ultimately gain far more.Marley in his own way represents that sacrifice - a pet probably not many would take on and keep and engenders a huge challenge to persist in loving and caring for. Therein is a lesson in how to raise kids and how to love each other even when we don't much feel like it.For all its fine, thoughtful, and charming qualities ""Marley and Me"" is not 100% a family movie - there's some swearing (not much - perhaps 5 or 6 times, all relatively tame) and some sexual innuendo but nothing overt. In the end I think it finds a pretty reasonable balance between trying to be a movie that appeals to adults and yet it doesn't kowtow to children either. The dialog and the acting are excellent (Jennifer Aniston is especially good) and whatever Owen does is understated and funny yet he also does serious when he needs to.In any case this is a fine movie that most adults will enjoy for a real character-driven ""dramedy"" (mostly drama, less comedy) and kids say 7 and older will be able to catch most of the finer elements of the script.",Marley & Me

One of the best romantic family films I have seen.Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston make a great couple here. There is that kind of chemistry like you actually believe that they are a couple. Owen Wilson is much better than in most of his films. As is Jennifer too.The reason why I like this movie so much is actually not the fact that it makes even the lukewarm est people to shed a tear (which I did), but it is Marley. The cutest and most awesome dog ever. I love labradors. And I love Marley.",Marley & Me
89,Mister-Creeper,Painfully slow and agonizing...,3,18 April 2009,"First off, maybe I had the wrong expectations prior to watching this film. I expected a much funnier, ""Disney,"" type movie that delivered a misbehaved, yet cuddly, Golden Lab causing all kinds of hilarious problems for it's owners. Boy was I wrong. This movie is not even funny, and quite frankly, I don't think it was meant to be. It is a very slow paced and drug out drama that should have ended many minutes earlier than it actually did. I mean seriously, who wants to watch a cute Golden Lab die a slow death for 45 minutes or so (give or take a few mins.)? This film could have been much better, but even with all the scenes containing Marley in them, I never really felt close to the dog to even care that he was dying the entire time...",Marley & Me
90,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,"Slow-paced, repetitive... but heartbreaking!",8,27 March 2009,"As a translator of the Romanian edition of ""Marley & Me"", I had the privilege to reach into the depths of the book, and thus become even more aware of the movie's faults. First of all, the script mistakenly keeps too close to the (real-life) story - which is simply forbidden, when we want to tell a story with the camera. Cinema has its own rules, and any road that departs them will point fatefully to boredom - at least.One of the main problems is that so many of the truly significant feats of Marley, those that helped his family discover the true meanings of life, are featured only in... words, while the visible actions center only around the same and same burlesque scenes. The dog's undoubtful love and loyalty to his masters is shown only in his routine jumps all over them, when coming back home. And the dogs themselves, those who played Marley's role at various ages, are sorely inexpressive - except the puppy at the beginning, who's adorable indeed (but this is his own merit, and the one of God - not of the movie makers)! However, ""Marley & Me"" gathers momentum in the last section, when it discovers indeed its own meaning: that of empathetically depicting the tragic demise of the hero. My own pitbull girl, Arella Bonnie Wagner's, was put to sleep in June 5, 2008, after ten years of happily living together, so I lived again those moments all along the final scenes, and I can safely state: SO IT IS. A Dog's departing back to our Creator is indeed a unique heartbreak. At least for this, I must pay my respects to David Frankel: although he sucks at comedy, he really does have a genuine tragic thrill - which, in itself, is more than enough.By the way - children shouldn't be shown this movie without parental advice. The excruciating good-bye of Marley can easily become more traumatic than a whole host of Rambo-like and Saw-wise slaughter scenes!",Marley & Me

Much the same with this movie; the first time Marley goes wild it's funny.

A lot of the dog behavior shown in the movie did ring true. Also, the way the dog affected the lives of the family portrayed in the film seemed genuine at times.Anyone who's ever owned a dog will likely find at least something that they can relate to or recognize from their own experiences with their dog, even if that person ends up hating the entire movie.",Marley & Me

But the acting and directing is spot on on this film, Jeniffer is brilliant in her character - it seems she's at her best doing 'real life' characters.

For those who don't know the story. It's about a newlywed couple, played by Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, that adopt a dog named Marley. Though seemingly gentle and joyful at first sight, Marley turns out to be a rebellious and destructive to their home. Though startling and a little amusing at first, Marley becomes a lot harder to control as the years go on, and even as they start having children. But despite being a naughty dog, Marley is also a very loving dog that sees their family through the good times and the tough times over the years.Well this is a Hallmark movie if there ever was one! Marley & Me is chock full of scenes that will make you happy, make you laugh, pull your heartstrings, and finally make you cry. While it is a happy and pleasant film overall, it has a few depressing and sad spots. However it these points that make Marley & Me a lot better than your average hallmark-type movie. They give you insight on the frustrations of being married with children, having an out of control dog, finding your passion in life, and dealing with loss. Before I saw the movie I watched the trailer and thought it looked like any other dog movie Hollywood has made. That's actually kind of true since some of the things in the movie seem a little fabricated. Such as Marley playing keep-away with a brand new necklace, and also trying to escape through the car window in the middle of traffic (While half of him walks nonchalantly on the street as his owner hangs onto his behind). These are the type of scenes that make the movie funny, but don't have the impact that the more emotional scenes have.The acting in the movie comes mostly from Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston. Owen Wilson plays John Grogan as a talented journalist who never takes life too seriously. While Jennifer Aniston plays Jennifer Grogan as wife and mother who at first has a hard time raising her kids with an unruly dog running around, until she let's go and becomes less stressful. Wilson and Aniston made a good couple and both of them play the funny scenes and serious scenes very well. Other than them there weren't really any other actors giving important performances other than Alan Arkin as John's boss, and Eric Dane as his best friend. Both actors give good performances that add nuance to the film.I never read the book and probably never will, but the movie was pretty good for what it is. It was an enjoyable movie to see on Christmas day, where the silly scenes made the movie funny, while the more sad and upsetting scenes ironically shape the film into something bigger than I thought it would be. The acting is good, the story is enjoyable, and the message and morals are the best part. Marley & Me is a simple movie but a good one at that.",Marley & Me

While my fiancé found himself laughing when that dirty, annoying, gross animal would get into mischief, I found my distaste for dogs grow more and more. First off, this dog did nothing but disobey the people who were kind enough to take him in. I found myself more irritated in the part where Jennifer Aniston is trying to get her newborn to sleep but can't because the dog won't stop barking like a complete moron for absolutely no reason. You see the couple grow in their careers, their marriage, and as individuals. You even see the children grow. Does the dog ever grow into an obedient, loyal, companion? No, he dies rotten.

This is a movie about the cycle of life and how life if often not what we expect. Through the introduction of the dog, Marley, we see how the characters grow and adapt and finally we see exactly how unimportant all those things we thought were so crucial really are.I admit at the end I was stuffing my mouth with tissues to muffle the outright sobs for fear I would disturb the other patrons. It was a beautiful and realistic portrayal of what owning a pet means and how even at the end of a beloved pet's life, life can still triumph. I'm so glad they didn't fudge that scene. I don't have children, but it occurred to me it would be a wonderful film to teach children about death by allowing them to see the natural progression as Marley slowly closes his eyes while his master tells him 'You're a great dog."" Then I came home and played a game of ball with my Irish Setter and gave extra cookies to my half lab who looked so much like Marley. He is very old now and will soon come to that point where he won't want to continue on.

105,ken_bethell,Neutered comedy - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!,6,10 January 2009,I want to produce a sure-fire hit. Now what do I need? A doe-eyed mischievous puppy is a good starter. A heavy dose of sentimentality never fails.Actors? Everyone likes Owen Wilson but most importantly you need ...... Jennifer Aniston! Is their more loved actress on the screen today? I doubt it. As you would expect the dog has all the best comedy scenes.What did they use to say about performing with animals and children? The storyline covering some twelve years or so of the dog's life is weak but never had to be anything else since the actors are only supporting players. The film was unnecessarily long. Marley's protracted death was presumably designed to send every child home inconsolable. Why does Hollywood spread the sentimentality so thickly? Are American audiences so different from European? Perhaps they are. Bambi really started something.,Marley & Me
106,trixie-k-88,"Relatable, but not worth the hype",5,23 March 2012,"Marley & Me is a decent family dog film, but not the 20th/21st century Old Yeller it's made out to be. There are aspects easier to relate to than other dog movies, but other than that it's mediocre.John Grogan (Owen Wilson) is a journalist who buys a Labrador puppy for his wife Jennifer (Jennifer Aniston), in hopes it will distract her from having a baby for a few years. But that puppy Marley turns out to be an out-of-control dog that never listens, destroys everything, and wreaks havoc everywhere he goes. Luckily though, Marley's antics become a muse for John's editorial, and help improve his career with the newspaper. Over the next decade or so, Marley causes trouble for the Grogans through the changes to their family, homes, and livelihood.Marley & Me isokay. It really is not worth all the hype people have given it. One of the biggest things people say about this film is that it's realistic. Obviously it's realistic, it's a true story! But unlike many people who found Marley's antics hilarious, I found them disgraceful. This dog's behavior isn't cute or endearing, it's bad, dangerous, and depicts irresponsible dog ownership. The only thing responsible about the Grogans is that they did not have Marley put in a shelter or euthanized for his bad behavior like many others would. Partly though, that's why it's so relatable, as most people don't know how to control or train their dogs. Along with the bad canine behavior, I found the human characters somewhat unlikable. I only started to enjoy the movie and see why people found it good during the last 20 minutes when Marley was old and dying. This is why people love this movie so much, this is why it is so relatable. Aside from the fact most people don't have a perfectly mannered Lassie or Benji at home, most dog owners have had to put down their elderly pets. Almost every dog owner can relate to the pain of watching your friend age and become ill, and then have to make the difficult choice to put them down. This part of the movie was well acted, and the audience easily felt the pain and sadness of all the Grogans as Marley reached the end of his life. But again, this is WHY this movie is so popular. The Grogans and Marley are annoying at best, but at the end of the film we don't see John holding the elderly Marley. Instead, we see ourselves holding our elderly dogs, and thus become very affected by the movie. In my opinion the movie is worth putting up with simply for this touching conclusion, but it's not the amazing dog movie it's made out to be.",Marley & Me
107,gevalero,Dead Dog Walking,1,19 January 2009,"Here's a movie that promises in every way to be a family experience but unfortunately has no idea what it really wants to be. I'm still wondering exactly which part of Marley's life should have endeared us to him as he spends 100% of the time destroying something. That his owners decided to ever let him inside the house is astounding. That they ever found a reason not to give him away must have been explained in the movie's deleted scenes. I guess if they had actually bought a good dog they would have formally adopted him (at least). I still can't believe the makers of MARLEY & ME thought it was a good idea to show us Jennifer Aniston's ultrasound results in progress .One of this days they should also explain to us what was the point of showing Marley being being put to sleep in wide detail, I thought I was watching DEAD MAN WALKING (or in this case, DEAD DOG WALKING). I guess the best way to describe this movie is as a biography of Marley's owner and frankly a bio about the writer of a newspaper column about dogs is hardly earth-shattering. I found funny how Owen Wilson was always shown depressed, even when he got the dream job, wife, kids, house with the pool & million dollar home in Pennsylvania. This is really not a movie for kids, unless you want to spend plenty of time afterwards explaining the sadder aspects of life.",Marley & Me

Marley and Me is a special rendering, some movies come and go, and some stay with you, you know being a critic of movies as myself I have seen crappy ones a lot, I dedicated myself to try and make up for that, thats why I only have one movie on IMDb which I didn't like, the rest is reviewed from a proud movie watcher. I want to recite to you movies that you should be proud of saying you have watched, even proud of saying that you cried, not every movie does this, and it is sometimes hard to find one, but this one does, lets go to the review""Story: 9/10 The story is about a couple who get a dog, the worlds worst dog. The story is actually slow, it doesn't have a really fast pace, it is one of those movies once again where the story doesn't have to be huge, it is a little lovable story, and if you had a dog as a child or even through your years you might just relate to this, but if you haven't then this story will still suck you in, don't look at it as a mediocre story or flick or something, actually in my opinion this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and this is the best I have seen with Owen Wilson, I didn't like his movies that much actually but this movie made my mind change and that is perfect.Actors: 10/10 Need I say anything here, actually no I don't have to say anything I already pointed out that Owen Wilson won me over with this movie and that is huge, also I am of course a huge fan of Jennifer Annistons movies, so of course I liked it very much, yet I still in the beginning hesitated but glad I watched it through, great cast enough for anything sometimes it don't need to be anything huge, sometimes it is enough with just 3 a woman a man and their dog.Music: 9/10 Everything was actually great the theme of this movie is very good, it is clear as the sea that they knew exactly what the theme should be and what they did with that made this awesome as well, but nothing more then that, the music is very very good, and maybe I will just buy the soundtrack which I don't do that often...Overall 8/10 I was pleased to see this movie, I was pleased to see I was wrong about something I see within movies, and also very much glad to say I was wrong about Owen Wilson, I just hope that I get to see other movies like this with him, not all those funny ones, he just proved that serious is really awesome, great movie, they knew right away what they would end with in their hands, a perfect score that is lovable, a story that needs to be seen once, and more then that, great movie, I will end with the quote.""A dog has no use for fancy cars, big homes, or designer clothes. A water log stick will do just fine. A dog doesn't care if your rich or poor, clever or dull, smart or dumb. Give him your heart and he'll give you his. How many people can you say that about?

109,Zen416,Contrived,2,30 December 2008,"This film looked like it might be a funny little piece of fluff to see around the holiday season but it turned out to be a waste of a movie ticket. I saw this movie (and gave it 2 stars instead of 1) primarily because Owen Wilson was in it (he's a truly gifted comedic actor for the twenty-first century) but even he couldn't save this mess. Jennifer Aniston did a decent job as the patiently amused but frustrated wife of Wilson's character and even Eric Dane did a fair job in his non ""McSteamy-ish"" role here on the big screen but that's about it. Pets are funny and wonderful and sometimes exasperating but building a cinematic movie around this stuff is pushing it too much. This flick would've made an okay Lifetime TV movie but that's stretching it as far as it can go. There were too many contrived moments (Look at Marley wreck the house! Look at Marley misbehave! Awwwww, ain't Marley just so cuuuuuuuuutte???). If I want to watch a dog act like a dog (i.e. wreck stuff, chew on stuff, ignore it's owners and do what it damn well pleases), I'll turn on Animal Planet or at the very least, look over the fence into my neighbour's yard at their whacko canines.

110,bdl7431,"Good, not great - satisfactory",6,1 February 2009,"Marley and Me - it's a good film, not a great film. It's falls into the classic tear jerker genre.We all know the story. The film, however, seems less focused on the dog than the lives of the owners. Marley stands as comic relief, as a means to move the story along, as a way to mark the passage of time. (although, most of the funny scenes are in the trailer).Will the film make you cry? If you're a dog lover, it will, most definitely. Dog owners have to confront the fact that at some point, we may have to have put our beloved animals down. If you care about your animals, this is not a decision to be taken lightly. One of the final scenes where Grogan is with Marley while he is being put asleep is emotional and hard. I am not sure if I could do that with mine.Still, this is not a challenging film to act in and it shows. One gets the feeling that Wilson and Anniston are just doing their thing. Really, some of the best acting comes from the actor playing the oldest kid at the end and his dealing with the loss of Marley. Also, the most interesting character (to me anyway) was the newspaper editor played by Alan Arkin. Some of the film shows a lack of attention to cinematic detail. Owen Wilson's character doesn't age. He is wearing the exact same hairstyle throughout the entire movie. Also, when Wilson picks up Anniston at the airport during a rainstorm, we see people in the background calmly walking around with no umbrellas or anything. Small stuff, to be sure -but distracting.Overall, it's good - not great - but good. If you're looking for a date flick, this may be the one",Marley & Me
111,deltajvliet,Marley and Me or: How to Manipulatively Exploit People's Emotions,3,30 December 2008,"I wouldn't normally waste my time with a review for a comedy like Marley and Me. The movie starts off like any mediocre comedy for the masses does. We're introduced to the characters, something funny (a dog) is introduced to the plot, and that device is used for hilarity throughout the rest of the movie. That would be good and fine for a generic and mediocre comedy like Marley and Me, and it was until the third act without much else to say up to that point except for a brief but positive mention of how deeply the film delves into the lives of the two lead characters, played by surefire box office stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston. Then comes the third act. Oh, how I hate this part of the movie. Marley is getting older. He has trouble climbing stairs. He eventually needs to go to the vet for a life threatening condition. He gets through it, but we're warned it could and most likely will come up again in the future. It does. Audiences are now subjected to about 25 minutes of Marley slowly dying, getting weak and more lifeless in his old age, and the family that loves him coping. Okay, I wouldn't really mind that much except for that fact that this is a major downer to end on for what was advertised as a lighthearted, feel good comedy. Whatever. But then they decide to show Marley being put to sleep. I can see the board room meeting at Fox...""Okay, so we invest people's emotions into the family and the dog. Then, get this, we kill the dog. Great idea, right? But we don't stop there. We'll actually show him being put to sleep, but as we do, we interlace it with the kids watching home videos where Marley does heartwarming and occasionally funny things as we play sad music and show how sad the kids are. And we can have a close-up on the dog that shows his eyes slowly shut. It's gold! Then what we do, for good measure, is have a funeral for Marley. We show his body wrapped in a blanket in a grave the family dug in the yard by their house, and we have the kids say really cute and touching things about how they love him and how much they'll miss him. It ends with Wilson doing a heartwarming voice-over about how dogs love you unconditionally. Fade to black. Great stuff, huh?""I was imagining this presentation as everybody around me sniffled and did their best to hold back the tears from what I found to be one of the most emotionally exploitative movies I've ever seen. I hated the movie at that moment. It became grief porn, a cheap ploy meant solely to make people sad and think of how touching the movie was, something probably thought up as a nostalgic throwback to movies like Old Yeller. But it doesn't work. It may be based on a true story, but that story remains manipulative and exploitative - a cheap shot assault on the audience's heart strings. If people can find meaning or emotional value here, more power to 'em. But I couldn't.",Marley & Me

This looked like the standard sort of screwball comedy where a cute dog exhibits extraordinary intelligence and abilities while the two leads mug for the camera.Thankfully, my conception was completely wrong.Instead, Marley and Me is more about a man's life at the beginning of his marriage and career and how he balances these two. Marley, the dog, is more a devise to mark time for the film and while destructive, is only a little more so than one might expect.It offers a view on how the hero (the man rather than the dog) makes choices, values his marriage and family, deals with career change and basically lives over the lifetime of his dog. While there is comedy, it is lower key and provides lighter moments from the depth of this movie.This is a far deeper film than I anticipated and I found it to be exceptionally good. A very pleasant surprise from what I was expecting. However, those looking for light-hearted comedy should stay away – this isn't that film.",Marley & Me
114,manusanchez90,"Not an average comedy! 7,1!",7,16 May 2013,"I thought I would be watching one more commercial romantic comedy, but I was mistade. This is not a pure comedy and is better than most comedies. The peculiar thing is that it has a dramatic tone contrasting with lots of funny jokes, dialogues and situations. The plot is about a young couple with a neurotic dog which seems to make them happy and angry at the same time. As the movie goes, we see the life development of the two protagonists as a couple. The cast is more than good. The starring actors are Owen Wilson and Jennifer Anniston. First, he showed once again he is more versatile than many think. He is able to act well in comedies (he has worked in one directed by Woody Allen himself), dramas, mixes of comedy and drama (like ""Marley and me""), action and horror. He plays the part of a very nice guy and in concret, the best part of the movie has something to do with his performance at the sad end of the movie. Anniston is not just phisically attractive. She is versatiles, as well. I particularly liked her in ""Derailed"" and ""Bruce almighty"", besides this movie I am reviewing. They two have enough chemistry and work well as a couple. The rest of the cast is good. I must mention the dog's performance the character of Marley is like a third protagonist. Other quite well-known people such as Eric Dane and Kathleen Turner are present inside the cast, but more secondarily. The pace is great for a movie of this kind. The director David Frankel (also, director of the good comedy ""The Devil wears Prada"" and the mediocre not bad comedy ""Hope Springs"") has done a very good job. The length is perfect and longer than in most commercial comedies, but never boring and made me laugh much, but almost cry at the very end! In its soundtrack, we hear some nice commercial songs already existing before the movie's project that I enjoyed listening to. The scenography is nice, too. You can see locations in Miami and Ireland. In conclusion, I recommend to watch this movie to all those who like dogs, comedies, family dramas and are fans of both Owen Wilson an/or Jennifer Aniston. 7,1.",Marley & Me

I own a chocolate Labrador so i could relate to a lot of Marleys antics i'd heard of.At first i was a little bit put off by the lead cast and the look of the trailer. Don't get me wrong i love Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston there good at what they do. But what they normally do isn't this i straight away expected a flop!.I was very very wrong. Thios film is anything but a flop not only Commercially (Outstanding takings at the box office , still in the UK box office!) but as a film.The story is a great and very real story which is actually true which i think always adds to the effect the film has on you.Jennifer and Owen pull off the lead roles perfect after watching i honestly couldn't imagine anyone else doing so well they made it there own. It's one of those films that make you almost think oh look there's John when in fact it's Owen Wilson they become there characters!.Even better whilst it's an extremely appealing movie to all and has done so well at the box office it's a genuinely great film which doesn't happen an awful lot these days!.The film will makes you laugh , keep you entertained and will make you cry like a little girl!. It's that powerful.The dog is perfect and i don't think enough attention is going the dogs way he was one of the lead roles and was obviously a perfectly trained movie dog!. He brings most of the films emotion and holds everything ion the film together.Most importantly though this film carry's an extremely important and powerful message not only to dog owners or anyone involved with animals but to every human being in the world.It's one of the films that in all my time of movie watching has genuinely hit me hard and made me think i think there's a chance a lot of people won't see this but for those reading this that know what i'm on about you know what i mean!.Go and see it if you can or grab the DVD it's truly a great film and will make you think.A high 8/10",Marley & Me

117,Unlimitedmovies,Kleenex Alert! This movie will make you cry!,8,26 December 2008,"Marley and me is a really tender-hearted movie about a family and their dog. I'm not wild about the fact that they purchase a dog when so many animals need to be adopted from Animal Control or the local shelter. I'm afraid that many, especially young couples, will rush out and buy a white lab after seeing this movie and so many dogs need to be adopted from the local animal shelter. I hate puppy mills. That said, the movie was very emotional in many scenes and my husband and I cried(I cried pretty hard) but the movie overall was very good. I'm not sure this movie is appropriate for children under age 10. I hope this movie will lead people to animal control to adopt dogs, especially older dogs who need a home before they are euthanized. My dog Joe is 16 years old and I adopted him from Animal Control when he was 9 months old. Joe is a mix of chow and airedale and is the best companion anyone could ask for.Joe was recently the first canine at Louisiana State University to have Stem Cell Therapy on his hind legs and it worked very well on his hip dysplagia and arthritis. My husband wanted to go somewhere after the movie but I asked him to hurry and get me home so I could see Joe and hug him.

The theater was packed, and all the good seats were taken, so we had to sit in the second row. The screen was huge from there, but we still enjoyed the movie. My friend normally never cries at movies, no matter how sad they are, but he later admitted to shedding some tears at the ending.I didn't know that the movie was based on a book until after the opening credits, where it said ""Based upon the book by John Grogan"".

Marley's antics are hilarious and we get to see the family evolve throughout the movie. I think the writers and directors did a great job in telling this story.All in all, an enjoyable movie with plenty of laughs and plenty of tears. My daughter and I both enjoyed it a lot.

Jennifer Aniston is as charming as ever, and Owen Wilson manages to subdue his frequently snide and wise-alecky persona long enough to offer an outstanding performance. This isn't just the story of a dog with behavior problems; it's a charming portrait of a marriage as the couple navigates their way through life while dealing with tragedy, financial difficulties, and the joys and frustrations of parenthood, in addition to that very energetic and lovable yellow Lab.",Marley & Me

On their anniversary they adopt a pup named Marley (who's so adorable even I want a dog like him.) It turns out he might be the world's worst dog, but he brings out the best in everyone. This is a wonderful movie that practically everyone should see. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll make you think about all the good in life. Anyone who's ever owned a pet will adore this movie. However if you've read the book, you'll already know that it ends tragically, and I walked out in brawling, but it's got enough humor so you'll be laughing too. Most importantly it has a splendid message: people don't care if you're rich or poor give them your heart, it will give you theirs. That's a wonderful quote, which we should remember.

Am i the only one that wasn't bothered about seeing it when it came out? But my mum bought it for me on D.V.D so i watched it. I have to say it really is fantastic!!!! Everyone always remembers how sad it is, but i laughed all the way through this movie. And Marley... Awwwww! Such a cute little thing!!! I don't own a dog myself, but after seeing this film i definitely want to. A dog is, after all, a woman's best friend. This movie encapsulates everything that a dog is to its owner. The good times, the bad times, the mess, the love and hanging out with the only one who doesn't care what you look like or how rich you are. Jennifer was a brilliant leading lady, acting with such conviction, and Owen Wilson was such a good leading man! The storyline is very honest about what it's like to own a pet and be married with children, but it includes some very funny moments as well. Overall this is a brilliant movie to watch on a girls night in, or to snuggle up with your partner and watch. It will make you value your partner, your life, your career and, of course, your dog.",Marley & Me
124,tha_mongoose,Cheesecake (not the tasty dessert),4,26 March 2009,"This movie has garnered ratings that far supersede other movies that deserve much better, and the thing itself is incredibly long, boring, and dull throughout.The review in question serves as a warning (achtung!) Do not waste your time watching this. Here's why:The only thing worth watching in this entire picture are the scenes that involve Marley. The dog is quite a funny vandal, wreaking havoc whenever and wherever he can. The scenes involving it's misdemeanors tend to be funny.Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson are mediocre actors, at best. The only thing Jennifer ever had to show for herself was her looks and body. Of late, none of that subsists. It's not so much that she's old, as she is clearly not, it's that just like Beyonce and Julia Roberts she has used too much botox, and this is evident: her face looks strange. The result is she is unable to command immediate interest in her characters from her looks alone anymore, and this has seriously undermined her potential.Wilson's act has been seen before. He offers nothing new in this installment, limiting himself to just be the same as he was in his 20 other movies. Don't go in expecting anything eye-popping, if you should risk going in at all. (Though he has pulled through some movies that are quite fantastic before, like The Royal Tenenbaums, without a good screenplay and surrounding actors of much higher quality, Wilson, coupled with Aniston, are just bland).At the center of my utter dislike of this movie is the cheesiness. Be warned, ladies and gentlemen, I have seen my share of cliché, dejá-vu crap, but Marley brings it all to a new level.Expect to be swimming in cheese during this movie. It's everywhere.What else is there to be said? Apart from a few acceptable scenes with Wilson's work partner and the dog, the movie itself (which runs at around 2 hours but feels more like 8) has nothing to offer. No engaging plot-line, no intriguing story, nada.Even if one is compelled to like what is being promoted here behind the scenes, i.e. making a family, things are not so straightforward. John (Wilson) and Jennifer (Aniston) are completely ego-centered, living immersed in themselves. Jennifer, who decides to give up her job to raise her kids, is always whining about it, which kind of defeats the beauty of her move, like she is unhappy with her choice.Of course she could have gone back to work after her child-rearing hiatus, but none of it.John is a douche-bag. He only thinks about himself, yet he's always undecided, never making up his mind, which makes for a thoroughly uninteresting main character (who is never satisfied, basically).The purpose of this film escapes me. (Well, perhaps it doesn't - to throw both of these career-dead actors back into the ""limelight"" (this superficial move seems to have worked, from the popularity this film is getting hitherto), no matter what crap they're showcasing. It's just a flawed move).A few skits with a dog doing silly things can be easily accessed on youtube. A movie created around those, and offering nothing else, is best left on the shop shelf.Stick to the trailer. 4/10.",Marley & Me
125,herb_at_qedi,Touchingly old-fashioned movie about the good and sad of marriage and family,9,26 December 2008,"Marley and Me is one of the best all-around movies I've seen in a long time. Owen Wilson poured himself into his character for the first time I've seen on film and was superb as author/main character John Grogan. The title dog was magnificent and the training that must have gone into the filming is difficult to imagine giving all that the dog did. Jennifer Aniston's support was professional. She provided a perfect and realistic compliment to the perpetually restless Grogan. Alan Arkin was excellent as Grogan's cynical but supportive editor. Kathleen Turner was a hoot as a Germanic dog trainer and I was thrilled to see Joyce Van Patten as the prudish proprietor of an Irish Bed and Breakfast. The dog-sitter was also a hoot. She reminded me of Emily Blunt but since I didn't see her in the cast, I must be mistaken. Whoever she was, she was brilliant. I was not familiar with Eric Dane from the TV show mentioned, but I thought he was quite fitting for the Sebastian character, Grogan's boyfriend who gets to do all the things Grogan wishes to do. He certainly is handsome. The actors playing the children all played their parts in a realistic yet sentimental fashion consistent with the movie.The movie was also very well paced. I didn't look at my watch once which for me is a major feat. I warn that Marley and Me is not a lightweight comedy. It will make you cry, and if you do take children, you should probably prepare them in advance for the issues involved when a pet can no longer continue.",Marley & Me

They are wrong and have a totally corrupted view of a great family movie. It is unfortunate to say that too many people out there cannot handle a sad movie.This movie is ultimately about love, and how insignificant our daily problems are to a dog. When some becomes a dog owner they are in a sense adopting someone into their families, and although, at times, that dog can be a pain ultimately we love our dog's, and cherish our times together. The acting by both Owen Wilson, and Jennifer Aniston was brilliant. They brought a unique real life feel to their characters which is easily understandable to most people.I do agree though that this movie should have a PG-13 rating. BUT! That is no reason not to bring your children to the theater. I know it's tough for some folks to explain to their children about life but, as for me and my children they understood perfectly. Yes they were crying at the end, and so was I, (men cry too). I really did love this movie, and it reminded me of how appreciative I am of my dog, and my family for sticking together. I am sorry for all those pessimists who haven't experienced life with a Dog the way the characters do in this movie.

It didn't take long for the couple to realize that a puppy is no less manageable than an actual baby.Marley then spends his time switching between hobbies, sometimes he munches on the new sofa, sometimes he pees on the carpet, MOST of the time he chases women, attractive or not it seemed not to matter.. and other hobbies that fit under the general heading: ""WREAKING HAVOC""..But just like any other dog, bad deeds only endeared Marley to the couple even more, to John Groban especially, even his newspaper column is dedicated to nothing BUT Marley's antics, to the delight of his boss and his readers.As Life for the couple increasingly became more ""challenging"" year after year, they continue to find solace and happiness with each other and with their dog Marley.***If you're a dog lover, then this movie will definitely grow on you long after the credits roll... not since Frank Marshall's ""Eight Below"" have a dog movie been this moving.",Marley & Me

The entire movie revolves around a couple trying to work on their relationship, face the ups and downs of their lives and all seen with Marley in the frame. :) My first impression of the movie was to enjoy its sheer cuteness and then wait for some sermon being passed on by Marley to the couple and how to live life to the fullest. Amazed as I was, their was no such sermon being passed on.. The simplest of stories with the most brilliant of shots make it soooo believable..

I watched this movie for the first time today and really, really enjoyed it and in saying that, I appreciate my dog more now! John Grogan's Marley and Me was fantastic and I can say, without a doubt that the film follows the book pretty closely, minus a couple of scenes left out but hey, what do you expect? You can never fit an entire book into a movie! Just appreciate this film for what it is, sit back and enjoy the ride. For what it is, I thought cast and crew did an excellent job. Marley's antics were funny and had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion. You can't help but love him! I did have my doubts about Owen and Jenifer playing John and Jenny Grogan but they were, without a doubt, spectacular! Jenifer Aniston was exceptionally good and seemed very in-character with her role. The beginning did seem a bit rushed and for the first 10/20 minutes, I feared this film was going downhill....fast but it shot straight back up again and settled into a more comfortable pace. This film is not your average dog movie. It has far more depth than that. It is not just about some wild-out-of-control dog who does crazy things. It's about family and friendship and the difficulties life can have. That is what makes it realistic. It also passes on a very important message but I will let you figure that out for yourself.This film is without a doubt, heart-wrenching. It is tear-jerking. I would recommend having a box of tissues on hand. I must admit, this film feels very family oriented and although some scenes may be a little intense and upsetting for younger children, you must remember it is only following the book and if it had not, I wouldn't have seen much point in making the movie. Just remember that. To sum it up, I thought this movie was great and although I think it could have been better in places, I am not going to complain. Just appreciate this film for what it is. 8/10.",Marley & Me

Jennifer Anniston and Owen Wilson worked perfectly. But the performance that stuck me the most is one people may not even consider. It is the one of the boy Nathan Gamble who played their son Patrick at the oldest. He was brilliant and convincing as if already a seasoned actor. And of course Marley himself was wonderfully entertaining. But it's not about the dog so much as the way he affected lives. Although I never read the book, I though the story was fantastic. It was magically happy, and fun, funny, and heartbreakingly sad. I will treasure this movie as a classic forever. 10/10!",Marley & Me
133,jmason72-1,Not what it's advertised as - better!,9,11 January 2009,"Let's get one thing clear first, Marley & Me is a story about life and death. The movie trailers give the impression that this is either a romantic comedy or a cute kids' film about a naughty puppy.Marley & Me is neither of these things. It's a sweet film about the impact that a dog has on his family. You need to know that the dog dies - so if you plan on taking kids, you need to consider whether they are mature enough to handle this.Wilson and Aniston give perhaps their best performances ever. Although there are many funny sequences, in reality this is a drama and deals with complex adult issues such as marriage stress, sex, post natal depression, miscarriage etc.As a pet lover who's lost some special mates over the years, my mind was cast back to childhood dogs and cats. The last 30 minutes was a real tearjerker. Even my cynical sister - who never cries in films - openly wept! And there was some big burly men wiping tears away when the lights went up. Unlike many other dog films, it talks about the very real consequences of getting a cute puppy. Kathleen Turner's cameo as a dog trainer was a great inclusion and the performances from the kids were fantastic too.My only criticism is that the various dogs who portray Marley didn't look that much like each other. At least two distinctly different looking and different sized dogs played the puppy. And Marley went from being a very golden Labrador to a much paler Labrador with a much longer snout and darker eyes! But these are minor grievances.This is a much more sophisticated movie than the trailers suggest. It's what good storytelling is all about. Enjoy!",Marley & Me
134,KateC49,Great movie,9,1 January 2009,"I read John Grogan's book on Xmas Day 2007 & saw this film today in Australia on New Years Day '09. I have to say they have turned this heartwarming & funny story into a great movie. The casting was right & Owen Wilson & Jennifer Anniston perfect in the roles of John & Jenny Grogan. I grew up as a teenager with a Golden Labrador in the family we all adored & in my early married life with a badly behaved Lassie Collie dog which had to be put down 13 years later. I could really relate to this family's experiences with their pooch & the sometimes angst it caused them. Our Collie chewed everything in sight & also managed to run straight through a plate glass door, jumped out of the car window and broke a bone in his foot... so many experiences similar to this film/book. And at the end of our pooch's life my (by then ex-husband) cried like a baby when we had to have our dog put down.This film shows the whole life of Marley & how he was loved and at times despaired of and at the end the most cherished part of this family. Yes I cried at the end & I thought it beautifully done but I also was crying for the dog I miss so much now. I would just like the film to have rounded off the story & shown that Marley got a book published about him & that they next got a docile dog who was never going to make it to the press as he was in fact the model dog they thought they were getting with Marley. Lovely film & such a nice change from some of the garbage that's in the theatres these days.",Marley & Me
135,ignus5uk,Not funny not good,3,27 July 2009,"With a pairing of Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, expectations of any sort of comedy are quickly thwarted within the first fifteen minutes of Marley & Me, which tells the maudlin story of John and Jenny Grogan (Wilson and Aniston), a pair of newlywed journalists, unsure of their readiness to start a family who adopt a uncontrollable, but ""loveable"" puppy.There is not really anything new with this film which is dull and hustles along trying to cram in as many excerpts from the novel it is adapted from without paying any attention to get them to meaningfully connect, making it difficult to accept as believable. What is interesting is the film spans fifteen years yet neither lead shows any sign of ageing - let alone a change in hairstyle. While beach-boy Wilson is unconvincing as a journalist -something that never seems to settle throughout the film, it is a wonder why Aniston keeps accepting these tired rom-coms, when films like 'The Good Girl' show she has got some acting talent in her.The ending will without a doubt be predictable and there is almost a shameful use of sentimentality to bring tears or feelings to the audience when there is actually very little emotion throughout the film.",Marley & Me
136,myspiderungoliant,For all those who have ever loved and lost a faithful friend...,10,25 December 2008,"...bring a box of tissues, because those who have loved and eventually had to make the painful decision of letting our best friends go this movie will touch a nerve, and remind us all why we love our pets.The plot of the movie is actually a very basic one. Journalist John Grogan gets his wife a puppy to take his wife's mind off kids, and their lives are never the same for it. We watch Marley grow into a ninety pound, underwear stealing, jewelry eating, drywall chewing wrecking ball, but we also see his unconditional love for his family, through the good times and the bad. And in we end, we see the inevitable end of Marley's long life and his family's loss at having to let him go.There are many funny moments in this movie, but this is by no means a Beethoven knockoff canine-comedy. This is a story of life, and a story of love in spite of difficulty, and this is the story that many people have shared as they have watched a beloved pet grow old and die.This movie was not just about Marley; this movie was about my neighbors lab Rex who died of cancer, my grandparent's dog Sooner who my last memories were of him struggling up the stairs with arthritis in both hips, and of my best childhood friend Skipper who tragically lost his life to an automobile.The insensitive will see this as a cute movie but nothing more. The rest of us will need some time to regain our composure before we attempt to drive home. Once you get home, take your dog for a walk, throw a few balls, and tell them what good dogs they are. You'll definitely regret it if you don't.",Marley & Me
137,bibleman24,Two Top Actors In A Terribly Average and Pointless Film,5,30 September 2011,"Here are some things I picked up from watching this film.Acting: Very good and what you would expect from Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston.Plot: The script is quite poor. It centres upon a married couple's relationship and experience with a dog called 'Marley'. One of the main points of the film is that the dog is supposed to be really naughty and really bad - but he isn't THAT bad. You don't watch the film with eyes wide open, staggered at what is happening. In other words, the plot is touching the 'boring' category. The film is certainly pretty good for the first hour or so. But then for the next 40 minutes (like so many films) it drags, frankly. A decent number of the twists do not engage much, either. Two twists engaged me, and one was definitely predictable, so it was not really a twist. However, the tale is still somewhat intriguing anyway and it keeps one fairly entertained - sort of.Soundtrack: Well, they added 'Lucky Man' by The Verve, so that's a huge plus! Other than that, not much stood out.Humour: It's quite funny. But it's not that funny. One scene had me laughing a lot, but most of the film is geared to bring some light chuckles.Morals: The film ends with a good moral. But this is not enough to save the movie from being little more than average.The major disappointment with this is that I do not think the plot justified making the film. When I think 'cinema', I think 'Terminator 2', 'Jurassic Park', or with respect to comedies 'Megamind' or 'How to Train Your Dragon'. Those are films worthy of being made and deserve to be put into the cinema. But 'Marley and Me' really does not stand out in any special way. This obviously (to me at least) begs the question of the point of making it. What's the point in so many people watching it?

138,nickcluxton,Unexpected emotional piece,7,7 November 2011,"I'm not gonna lie, I cried. For a while. I was expecting just a fun little movie about a dog. At first, it wasn't even that. Then, the dog came in, and it was what I expected. But then...I can't think of a better way to say it, but as the movie went on, I grew more attentive to what happened, as if I was there and could decide what would happen. I felt at home, so to speak, and the funny parts were whimsical, the touching parts were adorable, and it was a nice, slow, steady pace.Then the end came, and everyone was crying, me included. The dog died, and I was sad about that as much as everyone else, but what really got me was Owen Wilson (Can you believe it? Owen Wilson being influential! I would have believed it myself if I never saw this). He was broken, and it filled me up with emotion. I realize now that I'm sounding ridiculously cheesy, but I was moved.This is my 8th favorite movie ever, therefore I give it 8/10.",Marley & Me

140,LupinsGal2004,10 out of 10,10,25 December 2008,"If you think this is a movie about a man and his dog, you're half right. It's more about the man.Marley and Me is more about the Grogans, and how Marley subtly changes their lives each day, from beginning to end.This movie will make you think... and make you realize just how a pet can touch, and change your life.I'll tell you one thing... today three of the showings I tried to get into were sold out. The one I finally got into sold out as well. For each show, it was the same thing. People laughed until they cried, then just cried.It's a touching movie based on a real life dog you'll never want to forget.I'll tell you one thing. It gave me a better appreciation for my pups at home and how they've already changed my life for the better.There are a few people that say the end was too graphic. that's a shame. You missed the WHOLE point of the movie getting stuck on that one scene. the scene was necessary. If it were cut, the movie would have lost that one thing that connects the audience to the Grogan family. The mutual understanding. You were there through the good times, you grieved with them through the hard times. you shared the emotions. you shared a mutual love for Marley from the beginning of the book, to the end of the movie.It was raw, it was graphic, but we were sharing a moment that only pet owners can truly understand.I always find it amusing that there will be people who find this movie appalling because it touches a raw emotional nerve, but will turn around and bring their kids to Rated R movies with graphic sex or foul langage and violence. Kind of like the 5 year old who sat screaming a row in front of me at Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix... a much darker, and way more violent chapter to the Harry Potter series... go fig",Marley & Me
141,tstyles1,Disgusting movie,1,4 April 2009,"I watched this movie with my tenyear old daughter and I was very uncomfortable with all the sexual references, implicit sex scenes, cursing, kissing, making out, talk of balls getting cut off, humping....the list goes on. This movie should never have been billed as a family film. Adam Sandler movies match this movie as far as the content. I was going to play it at a school movie night because it was about a dog and was PG. If I had, I would have been fired. My God.Above and beyond this, the movie had no plot. It followed an ordinary couple through their mundane life. They never really explained well why they didn't take this dog back after the first day. During the movie it puked, ate expensive jewelry, consistently destroyed their home, attacked people, pooped everywhere, nearly caused a divorce, licked the characters with its slimy, nasty tongue (at one point it licked Jennifer Aniston all over and then Owen Wilson kissed her....yuk. Do people really act like this with their pets in real life? If so, you're disgusting). I more agree with Karl Marx when he wrote that the humanization of pets only hints at the dehumanization of people. The movie was intolerably monotonous. It reminded me of Aniston's last work, The Break Up, which centered around a volatile separation. It was hard to watch, and so was this piece of trash based on, as it seemed in the movie, the lifework of a sub par writer.Don't watch it with your kids or alone. If you have to watch a dog movie watch CUJO.",Marley & Me
142,Ronald_Mexico,Warning: This is not a family movie!!,1,4 January 2009,"After I saw the commercial for this movie, I wasn't exactly expecting a masterpiece. It looked trite and warmed-over, yet another ""wacky lovable dog does wacky lovable things"" movie in the grand tradition of ""Beethoven"" or ""Air Bud"". Unfortunately, my little brother saw the same kid-friendly commercial and immediately latched onto my right ankle, refusing to rest or sleep for an instant until we hightailed it to the theater to catch the latest Hollywood animal hijinks. After some futile initial attempts at resistance, I saw the ""PG"" rating and shrugged my shoulders in defeat, figuring that there were probably worse ways to kill an afternoon.And there undoubtedly are worse ways to spend an afternoon...it's just that, after watching ""Marley and Me"", I'm fairly certain that there aren't many worse movies you could view with an eight-year old.We weren't even a quarter of a way through the popcorn before I began to realize that I had made a terrible mistake. First and foremost, the language was not at all what you'd expect from a ""PG"" rated movie that's (allegedly) geared towards kids; there weren't any ""F"" bombs, but there were plenty of instances of the 'A' word, the 'H' word, and even the 'S' word. Sex was also talked about frequently, making it painfully obvious after some initial slapstick that the movie wasn't a lighthearted farce meant for kids at all, but a romantic comedy for teens and adults! It sure would have been nice if the movie trailers had intimated that, or better yet, if the ratings association had simply slapped the movie with the ""PG 13"" rating that it deserved, thereby helping ensure that it was seen mainly by the older audience it was clearly meant for.Secondly, it wasn't long before the antics of Marley the dog began to take a backseat to the utterly predictable trials and tribulations of the young married couple. If that wasn't bad enough in a kids' film (again, allegedly), we were treated to fascinating discourse about the husband's career path. We had the unique pleasure of sitting through endless vacillations by Owen Wilson's character choosing between life as a columnist or a reporter, and even witnessed a mind-numbing montage of how he got his column ideas (presented in rapid fire monotone) that left me longing for the quiet subtly of ""The Fairly Odd Parents"".As the plot labored onward with pregnancy attempts and a miscarriage, I slunk lower and lower in my seat, unable to believe how negligent I had been in trusting the fraudulent ""PG"" rating and thus subjecting my kid brother to material that was fortunately over his head but which also must have been every bit as exciting to him as visiting a laundromat to watch clothes tumble dry. Anticipating a loud birthing scene once Jennifer Aniston's character officially did become pregnant, I took him for an extended trip to the concession stand and asked him if he wanted to leave early. Of course he said no, that the dog was funny; relieved that I hadn't scarred him for life, I gritted my teeth and compounded my mistake by returning to the auditorium for the remainder of the film (by the way, I have no idea if the aforementioned birthing scene ever took place-- I purposely made it such a lengthy process at the concession stand that by the time we got back to our seats, Jennifer Aniston's character had not one but two preschool-aged kids).Providing a cure for insomniacs far and wide, the movie actually surpassed the two hour mark before culminating in the unthinkable: the dog dying at the end! Yes, what more could you possible ask for from a ""children's"" film than obscene language, sex jokes, and a dead pet? No amount of schmaltz was left unchecked, and by the end of the movie, my little brother was just sobbing (along with about half of the other kids in the audience). Me? I was left stunned, comforting my weeping brother and feeling as low as an earthworm's belly for having put him through such an experience. If only I had it to do over again, perhaps I could have suggested a less painful way for us to spend the afternoon together, like performing home root canals on each other and leaving the nerves exposed.Now, let me be clear: I don't let myself off the hook for this miserable experience. I absolutely should have known more about the movie before going, and worse, I should have insisted that we leave when it became clear that the movie wasn't going in the direction that I expected. But it seems to me that the advertisers and movie ratings association are both somewhat culpable for a theater full of crying little kids as well. The movie trailers on television were shockingly misleading, making ""Marley and Me"" seem like a Disney-type film when it was anything but, and either the ratings association is suddenly taking direction from Howard Stern or they just flat-out dropped the ball on this one. In writing this review, I hope to help others avoid making the same mistake that I did.If you're not an impressionable tot under the age of 30 or so, feel free to go ahead and give ""Marley and Me"" a shot! But if you're thinking about taking your young kid to what seems like a slapstick comedy about a dog, you would be wise to ignore the ""PG"" rating and stay away.",Marley & Me
143,stanley_9875,Stanleys Stamp Of Approval: I Actually Enjoyed It,10,19 January 2009,"When the commercial for this first came out, I thought, ""Ugh, another attempt to make a dog movie, like Beethoven. Lame."" And as my life went on, I kept seeing good reviews on this movie, and a friend of mine read the book and said it was really good. So I decided to go see if it was worth watching. I came into the theater, now torn by whether I thought it was going to be a good movie, or a lame one.Let me start with the characters. I thought Owen Wilson was a great actor for this part. I don't know what it is about him, but even a normal line made me laugh. He was just funny, but thats not all about him. He played his part as a husband and father well. Jennifer Aniston was a good character as well for her part. She played a good wife and mother. The way they played their parts got me really in touch with them. And Marley was hilarious. I thought my dog was bad, but not as bad as him. Eating the drywall and the floor? Hilarious! I got as much in touch with the dog as I did with Owen and Jennifer.Next, I'll do the storyline. It was wonderful. This movie made me laugh, feel stressed, and sad. I admit, I was really close to crying at the end, because like I said before, I got really in touch with the characters, so i felt I was right there with them. The beginning of the movie was funny, and i laughed at a lot of the jokes. Towards the middle, when they had their kids, I started to feel stressed. They have a bad dog, and three kids!? I think the part that made me feel the worst was when Jennifer finally gets a time to rest after she put the kids to bed, and Marley starts to bark and tear things up, making the kids cry and Jennifer upset. Owen comes into the scene and they get into a really big argument. The ending was the best part in my book. When Marley was sick, and Owen said that the vet could put him to sleep was played out so well. The way Owen was talking to Marley, and one of the kids was watching a movie with Marley was really emotional. Also, Its not everyday I cry in a movie. In fact, I don't remember the last time I cried in a movie, but this one got me close to it.Conclusion? A wonderful movie for the family. The best dog movie I've ever seen! Go see it for yourself! -$tanley",Marley & Me

Also because there are many sexual terms. Now this is meant to be a heartwarming film, and it truly is, so please don't take one these one star haters take to heart.

J.

146,Ironwarrior86,Most emotional and believable ending ever?,8,25 August 2010,"It's true that when watching this you might consider some of the comedy a bit so-so depending on your own personal tastes but from watching this when establishing the relationship between the family and a family pet; you could not ask for better. If you own a dog ; no matter how hard you try; you'll still compare Marley to it . A lot of recent films these days are soulless and have no emotion but this film proves that some people still know how to make a good film. Marley despite how mischievous he is has a believable character trait and I should know; my dog tore a hole in the settee. Oh and who said this film was made for kids? I have noticed some complaining about some mature themes in this film; remember that this film is based on an auto-biography by journalist John Grogan so why should they trim things out when it's supposed to be based on a true story? Anyone that read the biography should know not to take their kids to see this film if they're so concerned. There is a more kid friendly version of the novel called Marley: A Dog Like No Other which chronicles the dogs adventures but removes the mature themes; so if you're concerned let your kids read that instead.*Warning Next Part Of Review Contains Spoilers*The ending of this film is undoubtedly the most tragic and emotional I have ever seen; you would need to have a heart of stone not to feel you need to choke back tears ; the amazing thing about the ending is a lot of us have had to walk down that road; my own Dog in particular had been to the vet a few times and indeed the vet had been successful in saving his life but the next time round the condition had progressed to the point he was beyond help and needed to be put down. It hurt even more when I heard my dad saying to the dog a day or two before we made the final decision ""I wish there was something I could do to help you"". Make no mistake the ending really does show true human emotion as I felt the same way when my own Dog was put down in July 2010.",Marley & Me
147,moviefreak92,Absolutely Heartbreaking,8,27 December 2008,"I read the book ""Marley & Me"" last winter, and I sobbed at the end when Marley is put to sleep. So I had expectations when I went into the theater. I knew I was going to shed tears, probably more than I had before, because now I knew what losing a dog was like.I had an English Springer Spaniel, Whitney. I got her for Christmas when I was five, and she was a retired showdog at the age of four. She was nowhere near as badly behaved as Marley, but she did have her share of mischief. She was a great companion, and I loved her very, very much. Then, this past July, something abruptly changed. At the age of fifteen, she already had arthritis and was going blind and deaf. But this was worse. She stumbled around, her eyes milked over. We took her to the vet, and they told us the same thing they told John Grogan - ""Surgery is a possibility, but at her age she might not pull through."" A week later, she couldn't breathe - she had a tumor. And I had to say goodbye to my best friend.But I digress. I absolutely bawled, as did several people around me, and others could be seen with red eyes afterward (my theater was completely full). The movie was touching and heartfelt, especially for dog lovers who have or have not lost a dog. We alone understand the bond between master and dog. The movie was not for kids, though - some of the humor is crude, and the dog dies, of course. The humans were wonderful (I'm not sure I've ever seen Owen Wilson in a serious role), though I felt that at times their story took away from Marley's. John Grogan should be proud of how his story has impacted so many.See it in the theater. Bring tissues, but don't be ashamed to cry. Odds are, most of the theater will be.",Marley & Me

Marley and me is high up there!I love how the focus is not just on the dog, Marley, but on the family and how Marley has affected their lives. I also love how it's all very real, considering that this movie is actually based on a true story. It doesn't get too dramatic or funny, it's on the right level of realism.Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston deliver superb chemistry as the couple who takes Marley home and whose lives are affected by the mischievous labrador. The many changes they go through are excellently performed.Some of the humour used in the movie may have been a bit weak for my liking, and the humorous side of the movie is too reliant on Marley.Overall, it's a lovely charming film. There is a grown-up approach to this film, but it's certainly one the whole family will enjoy, and most certainly one for your dog to enjoy too!",Marley & Me

150,killblue,More than Meets the Eye,8,12 October 2009,"""Marley and Me"" exceeds anything that you might expect from an animal-comedy movie. Marley is a wild dog who finds a loving family with John and Jen Grogan (Owen Wilson & Jennifer Anniston). The movie is a chronology of the Grogan family's life with the ""world's worst dog."" The movie is surprisingly poignant and beautiful. Wilson and Anniston really nail their performances and give starkly realistic portrayals of their characters, two middle-class parents in everyday life experiences. Their time with Marley is fun, wild, loving, and beautiful.If you're a dog lover, this movie will tickle you to no end. If you're in need of a pick-me-up on a bad day, this heartwarming adventure will leave you feeling good by the end, if not just a bit heartbroken.Don't write this movie off.

In most cases, you can instinctively tell that you're in for a good time within the first five minutes. Such is the case with ""Marley and Me"". Marley is an undisciplined dog for sure, and there are times when you just want to kick him out the door and leave him out. But his energy and love soon win you over, and pretty soon you learn to accept this four-legged whirlwind with the heart of gold for what he is: a truly lovable and affectionate little critter.Owen and Aniston really shine in their respective roles as the couple who try, mostly unsuccessfully, to keep Marley in check, and bring depth and meaning to what is, in essence, a very simple story. But the true star is Marley, who in his own simple canine way, works his way into your heart, as he does with the Grogan family, making all of their lives a much richer experience for having known him.",Marley & Me
153,edharrison17,Rating,8,6 April 2009,"For all you dummies out there complaining of this movie being not suitable for Children...What does PG stand for?? PARENTAL GUIDANCE! Meaning that PARENTS are responsible for educating their children on some of the issues that take place in Marley & Me. This is not a PG-13 or R rated film and certainly not a G rated film. Based on the films contents, a PG rating is appropriate.As far as the film is concerned. A very touching movie about the somewhat hectic life of a TYPICAL family in America going about life and it's issues with a very cute dog named Marley.The dog was a bit destructive for my taste, but it made for an entertaining movie for the family.Parts of the dog scenes, being somewhat of a menace, may have been a bit repetitive. As the dog grew older, it calmed a bit, which made for a welcome change to the dog's behavior and a sigh of relief for the family. And of course, the last 15 minutes were sad.I probably would not have released this film around Christmas (due to the sad nature of the ending). Maybe a happier ending all-together would have been better, but oh well. The snowfall scene in PA was nice.A really good family film overall and worth the price of admission.

I mean I'm afraid to see the rest of the movie and die of boringness, I literally was getting nauseated just to see this mess of a film, Owen Wilson is not funny in this movie at all, but it doesn't show anything else on screen, it looks like the actors were just getting paid and not giving anything for their performances, it's just a blend, boring, story about someone, not the dog, not even the writer, the film doesn't get to anyone, it's just annoying everything and everyone, I can't believe they call this a movie or cinema, Owen Wilson, the ""actress"" Jennifer Aniston(which never showed anything on screen, on any other movie she did) and the director, who actually made some good movies before, just let me down and I'm not going to see a movie from them anymore, one of the worst movies ever, I mean EVER, that I EVER SEEN! give me a second while I go to the toilet to throw up and I will comeback to see the rest of the movie.P.S.: Apart from the boring, not funny, incredible without any chemistry, script, some scenes where just of bad taste, you see the dog drinking from the toilet, then you see him being feed cake with a spoon from Owen Wilson, and right after that he eats from that spoon of the same cake, and it's all normal, so eating cake with water from the toilet it's aaaall okay... not mentioning the part where the dog shits in the beach and Owen continues to be a bad owner and let him do whatever he wants, it's just a melancholic without any meaning movie that will make you cry if you have only 2 cells in your brain, or you are a dog...",Marley & Me

I channel surfed and caught the beginning of this movie and looked it up on IMDb as I had never heard of it. Saw it starred Jeniffer Aniston and Owen Wilson and almost changed the channel. But before I could, I saw the scene where the puppy was being bought and it reminded me of when my wife and I went out to purchase a lab puppy for our grandson. the rambunctious Marley reminded me of our lab when he was young. We were on a first name basis with the local furniture upholsterer a year later. We took our lab with us on a family vacation and we laughed at the beach scenes as they reminded us of our experience with our lab at the beach. As Aniston and Wilson started a family and the children got older, I could see where the movie was going. I am a senior citizen and have had many dogs in my life and related to this movie in many ways. I have always thought dogs were family members and much more than a pet. Some might think this movie was sappy or bad but I loved it. It told the story of a family and Marley was a member of that family. I believe it was the poet and writer Dorothy Parker that said, when asked if there are dogs in heaven, replied ""it would not be heaven without dogs"".

There...I said it. Now I'm gonna' whine a bit.Can't say I'm so wild about the screenplay. Like we haven't seen enough lighthearted, syrupy sweet, family dramedies. The book was about Grogan's relationship with the DOG. His wife and kids were supporting characters. Conversely, in the movie, Marley is reduced to comic relief. Not the slobbering, leg-humping nightmare you grow to love anyway. And let there be no mistake. The version of Marley you see on the screen is a well trained angel compared to the real Marley described in the book.This was an okay movie.

Mind you, my opinion could be a little biased as I do not/ have never owned a dog before. I must admit I enjoyed bits of it here and there. Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson played their roles to the best of their abilities as they really displayed clear affection towards Marley. However, I still find myself rolling my eyes over several slightly cliché~ or expected scenes. Towards the end, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over because it seemed to be dragging on for a while. So for all you dog lovers out there, this movie would be enjoyable. It's a family fun movie. but those out there who are not big on animals, this is not your sort of film. 120 minutes of film revolving around the center character of a dog was just not my cup of tea.",Marley & Me
163,cwood0609,Surprisingly Watchable,7,11 January 2009,"""Marley and Me"", for what it's worth, is a true family film. The first half, with cute puppies and slap stick humor, will probably draw in the younger audiences, while the last half, a surprisingly substance filled story of a marriage growing past its prime, will appeal to the parents. The inevitable last bit will hit it home for everyone. Even teenagers. I know because I am one. That really is a 'family' film.On a different note, what I was really impressed with in this film is Owen Wilson. I have never been too impressed with his work, he's tolerable, but that's about it. In this, however, he had a very heartfelt performance for what he was given. The last few scenes were among his most impressive work ever.Give Marley and Me a try, if you're out with the whole family.",Marley & Me

(yes there is a book), you see when i read the book and watched this it made a lot more sense to me. because in the book there is more details. there are many moments in the book that i read in the movie, even though some aren't in the movie, but still many were in it.the actors, i say they did good, not bad, not great, but good..for all the people, this is a true story, but Little bit changed, read the book to find out the real story, which is quite great. i would love to have a dog like how Marley was. as i said, i did tear in the end, i started tearing at the part where Patrick watches the clip of when he was a baby, then i kept tearing until the credits. it was an amazing movie, i suggest for people to watch it, and also to make the whole movie better, read the book first and understand the details more.a 9/10, but i rate the book a 10/10 so if this had every bit of the book it would of been a 10. great movie, well done. i loved it!..

165,alisafd,Story of the ups and downs of a family with a dog,4,10 May 2012,"This movie is only meant for die hard animal lovers. The essence of the movie is bonding of a family with a dog. However, the movie has every other thing except that. Jennifer and Owen are ordinary. The movie fails to give a home carry message. Owen is a columnist who aspires to be a reporter. Jennifer is a reporter for whom family comes first. Marley is a dog who is only interested in fun. However they fail miserably to come together as a unit in the story. None of the characters even vaguely wanders near the boundaries of emotions, forget about raising questions and provoking thoughts. The plot seems meaningless at times and the characters are not well defined. All in all, average stuff.",Marley & Me
166,garyb79,Great movie that's about more than just a dog,10,16 March 2009,"Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston have never been better in this movie. A fantastically goofy and tender adaptation of journalist John Grogan's best-selling memoir about MARLEY -- ""the world's worst dog."" The comedy elements are what you'd expect from a canine caper; dog poo and off-the-leash shenanigans feature prominently. But this isn't just another ""Turner & Hooch"" or ""K-9"" type movie. It strikes a great balance between wacky humor and a more heartfelt look at how a dog, even a badly behaved one, becomes part of the family. Through work and family crises, Marley always remains.There's even unintentional comedy IMO. It comes from John's rise from metro-beat reporter to columnist, which sounds like a fairy tale --(""I'll double your salary,"" offers editor Arkin. Yeah, right.) Be warned -- you may need some tissues with you when you see this. I actually saw grown men sitting in the theatre crying at the end and, yes, I was one of them!!! How many other movies can actually take everyone in the theatre from laughing to crying showing their true emotions!? There wasn't a dry eye as we all walked out of the theatre.Highly recommended.",Marley & Me
167,NancyLarned,Surprisingly good,7,28 December 2008,"I just saw this film tonight. I wasn't expecting anything great, since the trailers looked a little cliché and I don't care for Owen Wilson. What I got was a fun-filled, cute, and very realistic story about a man, his wife, and their dog!The film can get long at times, and the middle is upsetting during the husband-wife fights... but it is a fun feel-good movie. Wilson and Aniston had good chemistry, and the puppy.... oh my. At the end, I couldn't help but crying. And it takes a lot to make me cry! I enjoyed myself and, after seeing several disturbing films in the past month, it made me feel whole - as it was supposed to. The film was well- done, realistic, and fun. I left feeling sad but full.",Marley & Me
168,richteral,"Bad dogs, no talent, waste of money all round",2,3 April 2009,"This is so trite in its pandering to bad taste that surely it will have some success with the masses. I once heard it said that Nora Ephron would make a script out of a trip to the supermarket, but I suspect she would not be capable of going this low. The thing cannot be designated as kitsch, though, for kitsch has some underlying qualities. The attempted cuteness may be nauseating in places. I find a couple of incompetents mishandling a canine if not their careers just contemptuous, and certainly not worth writing about, let alone watch them in action. Mentioning Thurber here might be akin to desecration, but that is the yardstick, OK? Aniston is as anodyne as ever, and a couple of famous cameos help little (Kathleen Turner degrading herself) or just a little (Alan Arkin doing his best). Come to think of it, without the latter this junk would not even deserve 2 out of 10. Sore bum test? Yes, fails alright within minutes.",Marley & Me
169,dimitriteixeira-1,"Very surprising, very good, and very nice",10,1 January 2009,"Marley & Me surprised me. I never expected to fall in love with this film, and oh boy I am so happy I decided to go see this instead of The Spirit.I felt that this film was just flat out wonderful. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston have on screen chemistry for sure and along with Marley, those three are the perfect movie family. Although I don't agree with the MPAA rating of PG, I feel like children everywhere will love it just as much as adults. I guess many would say that the ending was predictable, but a sad ending can tie up a movie and make it phenomenal. I had never expected to enjoy this film the way I did. At first I was expecting a little, mediocre film with no message and how wrong I was. This film brought a wonderful message behind it and kept up with other great family films and will for sure go down in history as one of the best family films.",Marley & Me
170,Queer_As_Brian_Kinney,"An OK movie, not great, but not bad either",6,1 March 2010,"This movie I found to not be exactly what I expected, which was a light-hearted family comedy. Instead, it was different, yet just as good, as the family drama it turned out to be. Naturally, I sobbed like a baby when Marley was sadly put to sleep, (although my unemotional brother did not), because I had not yet read the book and therefore did not know what was coming. I still cry every time I see it. But I'm not going to waste your time talking about how depressing the death of the beloved Marley was. Although this is probably the best we'll see out of Owen Wilson for awhile, I thought Jennifer Aniston gave a pretty good performance. However, I do have a couple of issues with the movie. For one thing, they focus more on John and Jenny then on Marley. Although I enjoyed their storyline also, the movie was called ""Marley and Me"", not ""Me and Jenny"". But more importantly, this movie was rated PG, and still they clearly talked about Jenny's miscarriage, how they want a baby, and had (hopefully not so evident) a few sex scenes. Oh well, it was good for teens and adults, not for really small children.",Marley & Me

172,marknbkk,Awful for me BUT most will enjoy it,3,17 June 2016,"I settled down for a Netflix night and found 'Marley and Me', a cutesy story of a man and his dog. I like Owen Wilson's acting, I am besotted by Jennifer Aniston acting or not, I enjoy romantic comedies and I love dogs - what could go wrong?? One thing I didn't take into account was my dislike of stupid ill-disciplined dogs, with that dislike being only eclipsed by STUPID dog owners who are so stupid they don't discipline their dogs, allow them to incessantly cause mayhem, and consequently allow their dogs to train them. As such, I found the two protagonists played by Owen and Jennifer nauseatingly annoying and the film almost unbearable - however, if you like Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston and soppy story lines, and you don't dislike stupid ill- disciplined dogs and their STUPID owners, this will undoubtedly be a good film for you. (But it wasn't for me!!!) A very lowly 3 out of 10 from me.",Marley & Me
173,Rockhound6165,A Dog Lover's Movie *Minor Spoilers*,10,2 July 2009,"I consider myself to be as manly as the next guy but I do have a soft spot for animals. I have 2 dogs and 4 cats and it pains me to see animals get abused or neglected. That said, I've always wanted to read this book but never got around to it and was happy they made a movie out of it. What I didn't expect was to see how it realistically shows the audience what it's like owning a dog. Most movies about dogs are unrealistic fantasies with talking dogs or hero dogs or something like that. This movie gave non-pet owners a perspective on how a dog or even a cat can affect your life both positively and negatively. You simply just can't leave food and water and let the dog take it from there. It's the closest thing to raising a child. Dogs have personalities like you and I and Marley really was his own dog, as it were.Now, as for the movie itself, I knew from seeing Grogan on TV that Marley eventually dies as they had him 13 years. What I didn't expect was to have his passing make me, a 44 year old Corrections Officer, cry like I lost a family member. And I'm one of those guys who's good at keeping it inside even through the saddest movies but I couldn't help it this time. Probably because I understand that when it comes to dogs, there is no creature out there who loves you unconditionally even if you aren't the best owner. There is no more loyal animal on God's earth than a dog and we see how the Grogan family grew with and loved this dog and it hurts just as much for the viewer as it must have been for the Grogan family. This is a wonderful movie and a family movie and I would consider it a good vehicle to teach young children the meaning of life and death and they'd more than likely get it. If there were more than 10 stars to give this movie, I'd give it that because the message far exceeds some of the hokeyness of the story.",Marley & Me
174,Kurt_Pearson,Not a family movie...not a very good movie,5,2 January 2009,"I guess any movie that makes you cry is usually going to get a higher rating than a movie that you walk out of saying, ""What did I just spend $10 on?"" Understand first that this is not a ""family"" movie. Advertisers wanted you to think itwas so you would take your younger kids to it because ""family movies"" make more money than other movies, overall.There are sexual references and plenty of language that you may not want your younger kids to hear. Obviously, each parent has to make his/her own decision about what you think your kids can handle. But unless you want to explain squeaking beds and what John's (Wilson) real birthday present is when Jennifer (Anniston) is taking off her clothes, then don't take your younger kids. At the end of the movie, when Marley is mercifully and heart-wrenchingly put ""to sleep"", you need to evaluate whether or not your kids can handle watching the doctor inject the IV with the lethal dose and the dog's ultimate death.This movie is not that good of a movie because there is little or no plot. I felt like the scenes without the dog where only there to move the movie to the scenes with the dog. Wilson's and Anniston's characters show little, if any, change over the course of the movie. Weighty issues about marriage and child-rearing are introduced, but they are either not addressed or brushed aside with a contrived solution. The issue of post-partum depression is introduced, but resolved by Jennifer (Anniston) saying she was over-reacting and was just tired. Jennifer points out to John (Wilson) that he always wants what he can't have and nothing ever comes of it. The only development of characters is when they move, change jobs and have kids. There's nothing except the dog to make this movie heart-warming. All in all, I left with a huge lump in my throat, wet cheeks and the knoweledge that it wasn't a very good movie.",Marley & Me
175,richmovie,Could've Done Far Better,5,7 April 2009,"Reluctant to rent, as the casting seemed wrong, I watched last night in disappointment.Owen Wilson came around and showed some depth at times - when he meets his friend near the end in Philly, and realizes his family life has turned out better than the life of a roving journalist he once wished. But the biggest problems were Jennifer Aniston and Marley.Does Aniston know how to perform any differently than her Rachel Green character? I kept waiting for Monica and Phoebe to show up. Too bad - the part could've gone to any number of amazing talents in Hollywood today. But no - another Jennifer Aniston let down. I realize she's good looking, but her acting shows one dimension, yet again.As for Marley - why didn't they show the moments that Owens' character described to the vet near the end of his life? Do they show Marley looking after his son while he was sick? No - they show shot after shot of the dog trashing the house, running through a restaurant, chewing on furniture....ha, ha, ha - NOT. This misstep really killed the movie - for the audience couldn't bond with Marley, and couldn't understand why, at the end, they cared (especially Aniston) so very much that they were losing a family member.Marley's constant destructive path reminded me a little of the children's relentless mischief in Cheaper By The Dozen - is this funny? Do directors think we are this stupid? There should've been a crotch injury joke to ice the cake.The most laughable moment had to be when Marley gets let out of the house for a walk in the rain near the end. He's gone for probably 25 seconds and the whole family becomes 'over the top' concerned. Aniston could barely stand the creature 20 minutes earlier in the movie, now she is so overly concerned it's a joke. Not to mention they might like the dog having some space to run around now that they live in the country - Marley could be gone for hours without much worry to the average dog owning family.It makes me a little crazy to see very small things that could've been done to make this film better, but were ignored. It doesn't take a genius to see these flaws, yet they keep pumping these films out. Too bad - they had a great book to work from. The storyline was good, but they failed to connect with the audience.",Marley & Me
176,dreamer-17,Don't expect a light comedy,3,6 January 2009,"Comedies should not leave you bawling, but if you want to cry then see this movie.I would have rated this movie higher if it didn't advertise itself as a light, fun, comedy--it was false advertising. (but since when can we trust advertisers?).Spoiler: I would have rated this movie very high if it had a happy/funny ending to go along with the rest of this movie. We will not be renting this for the kids as they have enough heartbreak in real life and won't enjoy a sad ending.Why do so many pet stories include sad endings? Do they really think it adds to the film or makes it deeper by putting the audience through heartbreak? I love animals and in my life have lost many beloved pets, it is difficult to watch a movie with the main pet dying because all those deaths of your own pets come up fresh and painful. But don't think that I am a lightweight movie goer--I loved ""The Hours"" and cried through it, having loved a severely depressed person myself. But I was prepared for it--it had some fun scenes but was not advertised as a comedy. It was correctly advertised as a drama. I was prepared for the heartbreak.Life is hard, I prefer funny comedies or romantic comedies to have happy endings. You should at least be prepared for a sad ending in a comedy from seeing more truthful ads for the movie. Should I be afraid to see ""Bedtime Stories"" with Adam Sandler? Does it end in heartbreak? What about ""Yes Man"" with Jim Carrey? Does it have a tragic ending?",Marley & Me

178,hectorferjr2,Marley and Me,10,11 January 2009,"On Saturday Janurary 10 2009 my mom and my little brother and I went to The Movie Theater to go see the 7:30 P.M. movie presentaion of Marley and Me. Marley and Me is a 2008 American dramedy film directed by David Frankel. The screenplay by Scott Frank and Don Roos is based on the memoir of the same title by John Grogan and so my mom and I got our two Movie tickets and our popcorn and our drinks of Coca-Cola and went into the movie theather of cinema 7 and sat down in our seats with our popcorn and our drinks of Coca-Cola and watched Marley and Me. Movie screenplay writers Scott Frank and Don Roos retell the true story adventures that author John Grogan and his family had with their yellow Labrador Retriever dog Marley. The Story of Marley and Me goes like this Soon after their wedding, John Grogan (played by Owen Wilson) and Jenny Grogan (played by Jennifer Aniston) escape the brutal Michigan winters and relocate to a cottage in southern Florida, where they are hired as reporters for competing newspapers. At The Palm Beach Post, Jenny immediately receives prominent front-page assignments, while at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, John finds himself writing obituaries and two-paragraph articles about mundane news like a fire at the local garbage dump. When John senses Jenny is contemplating motherhood, his friend andco-worker Sebastian Tunney suggests the couple adopt a doto see if they're ready to raise a family. From a litter of newborn yellow labrador retrievers they select Marley (named after reggae singer Bob Marley), who immediately proves to be incorrigible. They bring him to Ms. Kornblut, who firmly believes any dog can be trained, but even she gives up and expels Marley from her class. Editor Arnie Klein (played by Alan Arkin)offers John a twice-weekly column in which he can discuss the fun and foibles of everyday living. At first stumped for material, John realizes the misadventures of Marley might be the perfect topic for his first piece. Arnie agrees, and John settles into his new position. Marley continues to wreak havoc on the household, providing John with a wealth of material for his column, which becomes a hit with readers and helps increase the newspaper's circulation. Jenny becomes pregnant, but loses the baby early in her first trimester. She and John travel to Ireland for a belated honeymoon, leaving the rambunctious dog in the care of a young woman who finds him impossible to control, especially during the frequent thunderstorms that plague the area. Soon after returning from their vacation, Jenny discovers she is pregnant again, and this time she delivers a healthy boy, Patrick. When she has a second son, Connor, she opts to give up her job and become a stay-at-home mom, and the couple decides to move to a larger house in the safer neighborhood of Boca Raton. John and Jenny welcome a daughter, Colleen, to their family. John celebrates his 40th birthday. Increasingly disenchanted with his job, he decides to accept a position as a reporter with The Philadelphia Inquirer with Jenny's blessing, and the family moves to a farm in rural Pennsylvania. Life is idyllic until the aging Marley begins to show signs of slowing down. When it becomes clear surgery will not help his debilitating condition, the family must prepare themselves for life without their beloved pet.Marley's stomach twists and he is taken to the vet. The first time this happens, he is all right. But when it happens again, it is time to let Marley go. John is with him when he is put to sleep, and Jenny stays home to watch the kids. The movie ends with the Grogans burying Marley in the backyard, and John Grogan looks back on his memories, and realizes what Marley taught him: that a dog doesn't care if you're rich or poor. If you give him your heart, he'll give you his. The Story of Marley and Me is touchingly told. The Acting from all the actors in Marley and Me Owen Wilson- Jennifer Aniston - Eric Dane- Alan Arkin - Haley Hudson - Haley Bennett - Kathleen Turner and Nathan Gamble is very new and magical. Director David Frankel direction in Marley and Me is fantastic The visuals are are awesome The music by Theodore Shapiro is great, and my mom and my little brother and I reely liked The Meesage in Marley and Me which is about the bonding that your pets bring to you and to your family what a clear and simple message . Marley and Me has won ""The Turly Moving Picture Award"" and my Mom and my little brother and I really Liked Marley and Me. Marley and Me is one of those movies Just like Edward Scissorhands that are simple, funny, gorgeous, sad, and sweet, perfect for playing over and over again I think that Marley and Me is an A+ perfect Oscar-worthy 10 stars excellent funny charming and touching movie I give Marley and Me two thumbs up and the score of 70 out of 100 and I hope you enjoy Marley and Me",Marley & Me

I was so dead wrong. The movie is about how Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston start their family by getting a small puppy named Marley. Marley is a little terror as far as dogs are concerned but the entire movie centers on how everyone in the family grows up and how Marley has had an effect on each and every facet of their lives and what having a pet can do to enrich your life. I'm not ashamed to say this movie made me cry...and not just like a single tear...but like, legitimately choked up and fighting back numerous tears since I was watching it with my buddy Brian (who also cried) and I couldn't get too emotional. 10/10 movie.",Marley & Me

The dog, that was supposed to be funny with his crazy behavior, mostly stressed me out. I've seen some good reviews of this film claiming that it is a refreshing, true to life comedy. I would say it is a dull movie about a normal family, with normal life problems and a crazy dog. They have everything but are still not pleased.After one hour we did not bear to watch anymore, I skipped to the end, and it ended exactly like I thought it would.You might think 2 out of 10 is too harsh, but if something that is supposed to entertain you bores you to a point that you can not even finish it, deserves a lower score.",Marley & Me
183,socact-1,Surprisingly Good,8,28 December 2008,"When I first saw the previews for Marley and Me, I thought, ugh, another desperate attempt by Jennifer Aniston to resuscitate her career. I used to be a huge Aniston fan back in the ""Friends"" days, but it's been years since I've seen any of her movies. And as for Owen Wilson, he always seemed like a goof who rode on the wave of his older brother's success. This movie proved me wrong on both counts.Marley and Me is about a dog, definitely, but it's just as much about a man (John Grogan, played by Wilson), his wife (Jenny, played by Aniston), and his growing family. The film follows John from his wedding night to the peak of his journalism career a dozen years later, years that are chronicled in his weekly columns for a Florida newspaper. Marley, the lovable but horribly destructive yellow lab, enters his life as a puppy, in an attempt to prepare him and his wife for future children. The dog, as expected, tears apart the house, makes wild escapes, humps the dog trainer, and lovably terrorizes other people. But the film effectively intersperses those episodes with tender, sincere moments of human/dog bonding. Marley is there to comfort Jenny when her husband cannot, adjusts to the children as they grow older, and intrudes on the family's most private moments. He is a constant, and at times, annoying presence, but Marley underscores the emotional tone of the film without dominating it.Similarly, both Wilson and Aniston deliver understated performances that convey the ups-and-downs of any marriage. While it is the bond between John and Marley that the film explores most deeply, Jenny provides the link between dog, family, and children. In the end, she realizes what Marley has become, and what he has always been, to the two of them. The film's overall tone - light, humorous, but at times very real - builds up to an ending that is surprisingly moving. Marley and Me is a tender-hearted, easy-going film that will appeal to any dog-lover. But it will also, I think, appeal to anyone who can look back on his or her life and trace a common thread through each passing year. A beloved pet, like Marley, has that unique capability. I wish I could thank my own dog for that. But, as one of the children in the movie tearfully says, I'm sure he already knows.",Marley & Me
184,the_ashby_family,Very Real and Funny,8,4 January 2009,"The one thing that would have made this movie better is if they would have started with the ending and then went back in time. That way the ending wouldn't have hit so hard and left you bawling as you left the theater. Nothing more embarrassing than walking out of a dark theater to be confronted by the crowd waiting to get in asking you how the movie was was and you are choking on your tears saying, ""It was very good."" I believe it would have been easier to take if the ending was at the beginning or at the end the family adopted their other dog and you left a feeling a little better. Then again, we had just lost our family dog of 15 years about 3 weeks before seeing the movie, so maybe it was us.Best things to come away with from this movie...ADOPT a dog, never give up on it, never give your family dog away and never, ever, ever chain or pen your dog.

There are so many dogs and cats out there who aren't as lucky as Marley and are discarded the moment they are no longer a puppy or kitten or their family has to move or has a baby or has some other issue that makes the pet an inconvenience.

188,StrongRex,"As a dog lover who has done research, this movie insults me",1,5 January 2011,"I didn't really see the point this movie was trying to make. In fact, I consider it to be flat-out awful. I've noticed that one of the most common reasons that people give for not liking this film is that it is not a ""family"" or ""kids"" movie because the dog dies and that is traumatizing for kids and parents who let their kids see it are irresponsible and downright terrible. But for me, if anything's objectionable about this film, it's that Marley's owners make no attempt to control him and that the film plays an unruly dog for laughs. Lack of training and control, to me, is a much worse message to be sending to children than a dog's death, which happens to all of them (as well as to humans, I hear). I get that Marley was an ornery puppy from the beginning but the reason why he was such an out-of-control dog was because his owners let it get that way because they made NO effort to train him from puppyhood, or any real effort to do anything about his behavior as a grown dog. Training a puppy to be obedient and submissive to you is essential if you want a good housepet, and that couple was just irresponsible. Not to mention that Labrador Retrievers can be the most obedient dogs around, so that should say something. There is nothing cute or amusing about a dog out of control, and the owner who refuses to take that control. Labs are excellent dogs and respond well to their owners, but Marley's owners didn't seem to have a clue as to how to train him. Or they'd start to train him, then give up and let him rule the household. I haven't read the book, and I suspect the filmmakers took a lot of license to make Marley more animated, but the type of behavior of the yellow Lab in this movie is not typical, or acceptable in my book. When they DID start training Marley, or trying to, he was already so set in his unruly ways that not even the obedience trainer could do anything. That's why it is essential to train a dog as a puppy, especially if it's going to grow up to be a big dog. It showed in the later second half of the movie that Marley began to calm down as the couple began to have children, and as an old dog he was pretty laid back until he died of old age. Some people might call me heartless for saying this, but I didn't really know what to make of that scene. I mean, it's always sad when someone loses a pet, but it didn't totally excuse or take away the fact that the dog was boisterous to the point where he put himself and others in danger and not to mention damaging their reputation. And his owners were majorly at fault for this BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TRAIN HIM AS A PUPPY. They didn't do any research on how to raise a dog, they just picked him out because he was the cheapest. They had no idea what they were doing, and they suffered the consequences of his behavior due to their incompetence. Granted, each dog has his/her own personality. As a puppy, Marley was doing what a puppy normally does, such as chewing up furniture. But if his owners had been more responsible, I have no doubt he would have turned out a whole lot better. I actually found ""Marley & Me"" more of a horror show than a comedy, and I found it hard to feel sorrow at the end of the film because Marley was in no way a sympathetic character. Dogs die every day, including many more adorable and lovable than Marley. In fact, my beloved Golden Retriever died at a young age 15 years ago, and there are times I still feel depressed because I miss her. And much more recently, I had to put down my Chihuahua six months ago due to him being severely mauled, yet I was able to watch this film without shedding a tear because Marley was more of an irritant than a friend. It is often said that there are no bad dogs, only bad people. I don't know if that's entirely accurate, but if any dog can be trained to be man's best friend, it is the Lab. The couple in the movie ""Marley & Me"" shirked their duties at crucial stages in Marley's life, and if this is how Josh Grogan raised his dog ... well, let's just say it would embarrass me to write a book about it. I hope to seek out Grogan's book eventually, though judging from this film, it would probably just upset me. I hope this doesn't sound overly harsh, but part of being a pet owner is being a responsible citizen and not hoisting your burden on others. Dogs are social creatures, and they thrive when they are integrated into your family and your community, not when they terrorize them. In conclusion, Marley & Me basically slaps respectful dog owners in the face by condoning irresponsible pet care. There is no point in the movie where the couple learns that what they did with Marley was irresponsible, or acknowledge that they should have done some research before getting the dog. I'm a huge animal lover, and I especially love dogs. I've made it a point to research breeds and how to take care of dogs since I was in grade school. And as a dog lover and someone helping to take care of dogs at the local animal shelter, this movie insults me.",Marley & Me

191,juanmiguelbuenafe,"heartwarming and touching: not a simple ""man and his dog"" film",9,24 February 2015,"First off, i know this review is very very late as this movie came out during Christmas Eve of 2008, but i heard a lot of good reviews of this movie in the past and i never really gave it a chance as i thought the plot wasn't interesting at all, or at least that's how they showed it in the trailer, But knowing this movie had A-list actors in Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, i knew i was wrong.It actually had a very simple plot with newly wed couple John (Wilson) and Jennifer (Aniston) are wanting to start a family, so in order to prepare themselves they get a puppy who will then become ""the world's worst dog"" in ""Marley"" although, no matter the hardships Marley has given the Grogans, the film still captures this in a very sweet way. The film spans 15 years until the time John and Jen already have 3 kids and Marley grows from a puppy to a really big dog, as time flies Marley gets more and more mature, Marley was there when Jen needed her while John wasn't, Marley was always there when the kids came home from school. The film shows that even if pets can be a drag with their barking and all, they will leave a deep mark in your life and the sorrow you will get when it passes away is unsustainable.Wilson added a different spin to his role making him a very down to earth husband and plays it well, his acting in the last few scenes maybe some of his best work. On the other hand Aniston was beautiful as expected, but in my opinion she really stepped it up in this movie. I've been a big fan of her since ""Friends"" and her previous movies but she nailed her emotions on this one.Overall, this film had comedy, drama, romance making it a quality family movie with great acting. I recommend this movie to anyone but especially to the dog lovers and newly weds, you will get a lot from this movie, but also don't forget to have your tissue as you will probably need it.",Marley & Me
192,the-ppfitzgeralds,Memories of Old Yeller,7,24 September 2009,"Wild horses couldn't have dragged me to the theaters to see this movie but I couldn't say no to my nieces and they are the ones that selected the DVD. What a surprise and how dangerous to pre-judge. ""Marley and Me"" has, at least, 4 or 5 elements that put it way above other movies of its kind. It reminded me (without being similar) to a favorite of my own childhood ""Old Yeller"" and that alone placed me on a very special frame of mind. Jennifer Aniston surprised me. Her performance feels and sounds truthful and thoughtful. The mother of three who left behind a promising career to dedicate herself fully to her family, reeks of a familiar kind of pathology that Aniston takes all the way without allowing the acting get in the way. I believed her and that makes things work on all levels. Then, Alan Arkin, he creates a fully fledged character out of a clichè. He's wonderful. And Marley? The series of extraordinary dogs who played the arch of this unconventional creature, is a triumph of sorts. Some of the music and Marley running I could have done without and I must confess I wouldn't have cast Owen Wilson but that's just too small a problem to spoil the surprise this movie provides. Kathleen Turner plays a cameo as a dog instructor that provoked a gasp in the audience. She's closer to Shirley Stoler in ""Seven Beauties"" than to Geena Davis in ""The Accidental Turist"" Use your kids as an excuse to see Marley. It works.",Marley & Me
193,madpinto,Really?,3,9 January 2009,"I'll start by saying I clearly had a completely different experience than most of the people who reviewed this movies. I felt like I spent 2+ hours watching home movies at a stranger's house. The movie went from being a silly romp with a unoffensive cast and cute puppy to an advertisement for Planned Parenthood complete with sleep-deprived induced arguments, an unplanned pregnancy, and little rug-rats (along with the dog) reeking havoc. I found the main characters' performances perfectly acceptable in the first half hour before they attempted to take on the deeper material that would have required Owen Wilson to change his facial expression once or twice. Jennifer Aniston's role required her to come across as a miserable housewife which she accomplished quite nicely. I found myself checking my watch more than once hoping for the predictable ending to hurry up and arrive. Marley pooping in the ocean is a perfect metaphor for this flick.",Marley & Me
194,littlepond,Pointless and trite,4,4 January 2009,"I went to this movie because my 17 year old daughter thought it was great because it made her laugh and cry. I did laugh a couple of times but not enough to make it worth watching. As to crying, I did tear up but only because they work so hard to bring you to tears.Here is a movie about a dog that I could not connect with and I LOVE movies about dogs, love dogs in general and have connected with them from Old Yeller to Benji to Turner and Hooch. I spent a goodly amount of time through the movie thinking to myself.. ""why don't they get rid of that animal... in my home, he would be sooooo to the shelter."" This is a dog without redeeming social value and without a hit of unique personality that makes him lovable just an overgrown out of control puppy that this family hangs on to beyond reason.Then in the end the dog grows old and dies and the director milks that from the euthanasia scene in the vets to the burial at home for all it's worth.Remove the dog from the movie or make him interesting and not so overbearing and this could have been a good movie... or at least a decent one.Of course, then you have the matter of the constant references to sex and a marriage that is not from any part of real life I have ever seen.Bottom line: forget it there is nothing there.",Marley & Me

Great Film.",10,29 March 2019,"Personally, I thought this was a great film because it was based off of the memoirs from family man journalist, John Grogan- which makes the story an original one. Not to mention that the film was about a columnist and his dog, and yet it was still exciting. As for the actors, Owen Wilson is a natural talent. He can match any character whether it be a war hero (Behind Enemy Lines) or an everyday hero that saves his family from terrorists in a political uprising (No Escape).
Jennifer Anniston redefines acting just by looking at her genuine performance in F.R.I.E.N.D.S or something newer like Just Go With It. The film was a major success because it made you laugh, cry, and relate.",Marley & Me

But it turned out to be one of the best films I've seen in ages! The acting was top notch, the soundtrack was also great, the magic of an ordinary life revealed in a movie that can only be described as a perfect production. This film will grab your attention and makes you care about the characters and relate to them and feel their joys and sorrows in a way that so many films fail to do these days even with their huge budgets.A must see if you believe in the simple, yet beautiful things, in life.

197,drea_me_3000,Bring tissues... and I'm talking to you guys mostly,10,25 December 2008,"I love Owen Wilson, this movie validated why. I wasn't a big Jennifer Aniston fan... this movie changed my mind.These two actors perfectly conveyed every emotion the audience was suppose to feel with them.When they laughed, we laughed harder, when they cried, the theater flooded.this is the timeless tale of how lives can be touched by an animal, that the unconditional love they give makes everything worth all they can sometimes put you through, and that they will change your life for the better, just for having known them.I'd have to say, while there was not a single dry eye in the theater... the guys were wailing the most. one guy was walking out and he said, ""That was my Benny. Tell me that wasn't Benny up there. That was a damn good dog."" Even this teenaged boy sitting to my right was trying to wipe away tears by pretending he was itching his eye.This isn't just your typical pet story... this is more about the people that are in Marley's life, and how he affects their lives little by little, leaving a lasting impression. Their hearts were so much bigger for having known Marley.I don't think there was a single person who didn't leave sniffling if not down right bawling. Just be prepared for that.this is more than a holiday feel good movie... the book was more than a collection of silly stories about a dog.Its about love, all the good, and the bad moments in our lives that are healed by love. In this case, the unconditional love of a pet.On a plus side... fans of the Marley and Me book can rest happy knowing that, minus very minor changes, this holds true to the book.",Marley & Me

There's no plot (unless you count ""some people get married and get a dog..."").There is no chemistry between the starts, Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson, nor is there even any chemistry between either of them and the dog. A lovely Yellow Lab.I am guessing the screenplay was slapped together from a series of mildly amusing essays written by some much blander Dave Barry type columnist, that someone thought might make a movie since there's like umpteen Beethoven movies that manage to still sell tickets.",Marley & Me

Also I'm still trying to understand what was the scenario? I'm sure that the book is better (it's always better) than the movie, but what did the author tried to say to us? that his dog died when it got old and that the family that owned it cried when it died? Wow that's unbelievable unique!!!. I don't think that this has ever happened to anyone before.7.2 at IMDb!!!!! wow there must be a lot of people here who own a dog.Were all the good scenarios have gone. Why do we have to see these movies? Is there a plan from Hollywood to make us stupid. Is earth going to be destroyed in 2012 and they are trying to make us numb, so we won't feel anything?",Marley & Me
200,janed74,Woefully inadequate,1,7 April 2009,"Does not deliver. It was twenty minutes into the film I realised I was still waiting for something to happen, and reflected that really, that something might never eventuate. Jennifer A has the ability to look hot, and happy. She looks flat, and shows her age. As does Owen Wilson, and his whiney voice really stood out, as well, whiney. There was no realism in the story as no normal people would have put up with such a destructive, unlikeable dog. Also didn't recognise Kathleen Turner, and was disappointed such a gorgeous sparky actor was reduced into an uninteresting unlikeable person, she did a good job. The humour was so lame.. thats all i can stand to waste more time on this egotistical drivel.",Marley & Me

They move into a house. John' friend, Sebastian, played by Eric Dane, advises to distract her from wanting children by bringing a dog into their lives. That would be Marley. David Frankel, the director, mixes dramatic moments next to comedic ones. Writers Scott Frank's and Don Roos's (based on the novel by Grogan) script kind of goes on and on, following this dog's lifetime.All in all, it was a pleasant film, but one that i got too excited about.",Marley & Me

We watch as the family grows and how their silly dog is a very important part of the family. Anyone who has had a dog can relate the movie moves along at a nice pace. Both Anniston and Wilson did very well here especially Wilson as we get to see him acting a serious part and doing it so well.",Marley & Me
203,Sexycamel,"A cute movie, but you'll be upset after watching it",7,9 January 2010,"Marley And Me is a great film, it is! It's cute,funny,and sweet. But the problem is, through the movie, all that seems to change.So it's just a movie about a guy named John, his wife Jenny and their new dog Marley. Even though Marley is incorrigible, he changes the family's life.Well,the first half of the film is just perfect. Very funny and cute, and enjoyable by no doubt. But then it gets too serious. And I mean /too/ serious. It suddenly turned into a sad drama, and after watching the fun first half, I was just let down a little. I've read the book, and let me tell you; It is WAY more depressing than the book! I liked it, I really did. But after I watched it, I didn't feel the happiness I normally feel after a cute dog film. It took me at least an hour to get over it.I read the book before the movie came out, so I was expecting the sad things, but I didn't expect it to be so deep.So, to clear things up, Marley And Me is clearly more of a drama than a comedy, and is not for sensitive people. But I'll say this; It proves how pets can change our lives. So, by that, I'll say it was decent. I gave it 7/10 for the first half comedy and it's important message. And even succeeding to make itself more deep than the book.",Marley & Me

The acting was satisfactory, the early part was enjoyable and at times funny, but this is where the bad review starts.The plot is the same as always except NO HAPPY ENDING!!!! for a PG film that is targeted with children in mind, there is a lot of sexual references used, the odd swear word and the worst thing of all the dog dies and then the film ends!! No new puppy for the family to enjoy or a cat or a bloomin crocodile for that matter. So when the credits appear even adults are left with a empty feeling about the film they had just experienced. If i let my kids see this with no idea what the film was about to give them, i'd be spitting blood! I can imagine families going to the cinema excited about seeing a feel good animal movie and then leaving with a line of bawling kids in tow.In my personal opinion they borrowed a storyline used by so many other mediocre family movies that they should of kept with the same ending used millions of times before.Very disappointing, i enjoy Wilson's work namely Behind enemy lines and Zoolander, but sorry sir this is not one for your Resume.Parents WATCH first!",Marley & Me

The only thing I disagree with was the end it was a sad sad sad last 30 mins of a movie and I think that it could have remained sad but maybe they just had a happy ending like ""they get another dog"" or something instead of leaving me and my girlfriend sobbing on the couch. I do not think it is as ""SAD"" as some people who said things like ""I sat in my car for 30 mins crying in the parking lot."" get a grip here the second it was over I had stopped the water works. Overall though I was pleased my Girlfriend has a yellow lab named Sophie and she is about 2 years old. We had a great time watching all the funny parts relating if that were to happen with her dog.

206,danka-v-95,A therapeutic movie for me,9,9 October 2019,"This was kind of a therapeutic movie for me. Last year my dog got sick in a really unexpected way, and he got bad in a really short time. Although he was old enough, it was kind of unexpected, and harsh enough to accept the fact that we must put him to sleep. At that time, I didn't have enough strength to be there at the time of his death, so I kind of missed the process of true grieving. During this movie I watched all the scenes and I survived. I cried myself out so much and that was the spot on the i. So it is therapeutic value that I see in this movie.The movie itself is funny, and realistic at the same time. Although it is not very complex kind of movie, it shows some important social topics. It shows different types of lives and characters through some very common stories. We all have our own ways, no matter how sometimes they seem like cliches.
And as it says, it is not that nobody tells us that life and family is hard, but we don't want to believe in it. Although it is sometimes hard, if we are committed enough it will pay itself out.
The life of Sebastian is hard in its own way. You just can't have everything, so you must choose what is your path.I liked this movie very much and I recommend it.",Marley & Me

After finally getting around to watching it recently I knew this was going to be a sappy tear jerker that tries too hard to get you invested, but I had no clue it'd be this bad. The actors in the movie do good, Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston do well with the parts they're given and Kathleen Turner is hilarious in the minor part she has, but this movie is just predictable as it gets, you can literally see every scene coming from a mile away. YOU KNOW the dog is going to be untrainable yet they make something funny out of it. YOU KNOW the dog is going to get the family into a bunch of trouble yet the family will forgive the dog for stupid reasons even I can't comprehend.

I'd strongly suggest skipping out on this. It may have good performances, but a generic plot doesn't help the movie at all.

It starts slow, meanders through a series of mid-life crises, then ends with heartbreak.Owen Wilson plays a self-absorbed, whiny character. From the beginning, he is threaten ed by anyone else's success.Jennifer Aniston plays a self-negating,whiny character. We don't see why they are involved with each other. And we certainly don't see what each brings to the other to keep them together for so long. The best friend character serves only as a catalyst for John Grogan's dissatisfaction with life.And then there is Marley. I've loved good dogs and bad dogs, but this is inexplicable.

209,thelonesoldier-1,"A mindless, poorly made film",4,30 December 2008,"""Marley and Me"" is a trite, generic, and pandering film that fails to bring anything original or noteworthy to the screen. Many of the jokes are painfully bad, but this is just the beginning of the trouble.Owen Wilson's performance is acceptable but not great, with absolutely nothing memorable about it. Jennifer Aniston delivers a rather accurate portrayal of an angry mom who hates dealing with her kids, but it's impossible to feel sorry for this wealthy family who have never experienced any hardship except raising the kids they chose to have. The dog is often cute, but its behavior is overly exaggerated to the point of absurdity - the film is constantly pounding into your mind that this is the ""worst dog ever,"" while Marley's behavior is perfectly understandable and normal for a dog that has not been trained at all by its owners. It's funny watching the dog race through a house to jump into a pool with no hesitation, but stupid to hear the claim that the dog ate an answering machine whole without chewing and came back for the phone for desert. Much of the script and humor is equally contrived and predictable.The film fails most notably in its selective, arbitrary portrayal of time. The flow of time is completely inconsistent - during the fifteen years that the film covers, the dog only ages twice, suddenly going from puppy to adult and suddenly going from adult to elderly. Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson's characters do not age A SINGLE DAY in fifteen years - Owen appears to have filmed all his scenes in a week, as his hair never even changes style or length. Their early-twenties female neighbor does not age at all in five years, and Owen's elderly boss never gains a wrinkle or loses a hair. Again, it is impossible to feel sorry for the main couple, as they never show any signs of aging, and Aniston looks exactly the same after three pregnancies as she did when they first married.Another notable flaw, this film ""about a dog"" is mostly about the family besides the dog. The film follows Marley in the beginning and end, but almost completely forgets him in the middle. Finally, the film has almost no ethnic diversity. The characters essentially exist in an all-white America. There are only FOUR non-white people on screen in the ENTIRE film - including extras. Two of the only three blacks that appear in the entire film are GARBAGE COLLECTORS.Those seeking mindless warm fuzzy feelings and equally mindless ""ooh the dog chewed something that's hilarious"" humor will enjoy the film. Those who think while watching may not enjoy it so much.",Marley & Me

211,A_Gooner,Generic idea surprises and delivers!,8,23 April 2009,"After seeing the trailer to this movie months ahead of its release every time I went to catch a movie, I inadvertently established what the movie is about, and decided id pass this one. I mean let's face it, we all know what dog (pet in general) movies are all about, especially when the plot revolves around a couple, and who wanted to see Owen Wilson play Jennifer Aniston's husband anyways, there was no way he was going to top Vince's performance! But as most other guys, my girl nagged her head off and I went along.The movie started on a sort of a generic note, but as the movie progressed it got quite clear why it started off in such a way. The setting was very typical, but one that I normally enjoy ... big city life, young couple with similar careers, and all that jazz. John Grogan's career is moving up the line, and with this Jennifer Grogan's plan was coming into shape. John fearing that Jennifer was going to pop the idea of children up, decides to bring a pet into the household in an attempt to distract her, taking up on his friend and work mate Sebastian's (Eric Dane) idea. This was the part of the movie which was pretty much expected and up until that point the plot I made in my head wasn't too far off. But when John realizes he is ready to commit to building a family, the plot thickens. Not to throw away too much, this is the part of the movie where Marley connects with the family on so many levels and Jennifer Aniston was delivering one of her best performances. David Frankel really manages to get us involved in the Grogans' life and how they evolved through the years.At this point, as good as the movie was, it seemed that there wasn't a real twist. But it built up smoothly towards a really touchy ending that I can safely say, its been a while I haven't witnessed. It really reminds the viewer of the quality things in life, and it left a tear or two in my eyes. When the movie ended, it was just weird looking at everyone's faces, it was as if they had all involved somehow in that life changing experience.A great movie with strong performances, especially by Aniston that deserves to be watched by people of all age groups!

I just didn't realize he was getting old and approaches the end of his life.The most important thing is family. Just the fact the owners have no friends, other then Marley, points out this fact. I got it on Netflix. I wish I saw it in the movies. The acting was way better then I expected from the ""B"" cast. They are ""A"" listers in my book after this. See the movie, it is one of this year.

Their relationship was the main focus of the film, with the dog being the backdrop to show it., and how Marley affects it.Their relationship was also allowed to evolve because of a very small, but good supporting cast. Allan Arkin was good as Owen Wilson's boss/ mentor and had some very good lines (' Tell your dog that eventually we all get our balls cut off). The guy who played his friend (cant remember his name) played a similar character to his character in Grey's Anatomy, but did a good job. The rest of the cast (which were essentially cameos ) were fine, from what little amount we saw of them.Overall, an enjoyable film, and it's alright for kids ages 10 and up, since there some adult content, although there are a lot of funny scenes with Marley for the kids.",Marley & Me
216,k-onne-r,Pleasantly Surprised.,8,4 January 2009,"Marley & Me is one of those movies that you predict will suck, but in the end, you actually enjoyed it. When people say that the story is too basic and similar. I have to disagree. Over the years of the 21st Century, we've had films that have been uncreative and similar to others. Like Lucky Number Slevin being similar towards Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. 300 being similar towards Braveheart. Back then in the 60's and 70's, there were countless movie ideas. And now, there are ideas, and there are still very good films that are released today. But when it comes to Disney films. They usually suck. Bedtimes Stories was awful. And when I walked into this I didn't know what to expect.The movie never transcended. At first it was at a level of being satisfactory, and then the movie got more sentimentally engaging and the movie got even better. I wouldn't say the film is amazing. But women of all ages will love it. In my audience, I could here people crying. I wasn't crying, but it was surprisingly emotional. And while it was sappy, it had some funny bits in there.I have to say that the writing wasn't very good. But overall, for a very mechanical and simple film, they execute to making it a lively and well-spent movie experience.People are saying that the sexual content is way too inappropriate for young children. I disagree, Owen Wilson's character and Jennifer Anistan's character are both married, so when they both talk about sex and children isn't inappropriate.I'm trying not to defend this movie from bad reviews, I was just surprised and unsettled with the horrid reviews. I giving this movie some credit, i'm also saying that this is one of Owen Wilson's finest performances.",Marley & Me
217,dkpedigo,Surprisingly Amazing,10,24 March 2009,"To be perfectly honest, when I got this film from work, I thought it was just going to be another one of those stupid romantic comedies that simply happen to involve a dog.I was wrong.This movie was excellent. Though it has a simple premise, a young couple, late 20's, maybe 30, get married and start a life together. They decided to get a yellow lab ""clearance puppy"", who they name Marley. Of course, the dog is crazy (though to be perfectly honest, most dogs are).The movie does a good job presenting the life of a middle to upper-middle class family. Two cars, three kids, and an dog that very seems to be a much smaller and much more hyper Beethoven.The end is probably the best part, with the entire movie building to it. I'll try not to ruin it, but needless to say, it actually made me cry, which is a rarity (the only other movie that has ever made me actually cry was that one about 9-11 they made for TV, and that was more from my own memories than the movie). It reminded me a great deal of my own feelings I've had for my dogs.In the end, if you're not a dog person, then this movie will probably lack the same amount of impact, same if you're still a kid (you know who you are, internet). However, if you are a dog loving adult, younger (like me, who are dearly hoping they're life won't be as complicated as the movie showed it) or older (who will readily admit that it is that complicated...), I highly suggest it.",Marley & Me
218,emd3721,I loved and hated this movie,9,11 April 2009,"The only reason I hated this movie is because I stared crying uncontrollably. the only other movie that happened to me was ""My Dog Skip"". I have two dogs of my own. I've had them for five years now, since thay were puppies, just thinking about losing them breaks my heart. I know it going to happen sooner or later but I don't like to even think about it.The beginning was good. There were a lot of funny parts (most of which were in the trailer, but they were still funny.) I like seeing how the family evolved throughout the years, it remined me of how would like to have my life turn out. But the ending was just too much for me watching that dog laying there and his eyes closing for the last time was too much for me.The only thing better then a mothers love is the love of a good dog.",Marley & Me
219,Marcos_del_bauer,A good movie,7,16 August 2009,"We rented some movies from blockbuster one night and neither of which I had heard very much about. As I looked at the covers I wasn't very impressed at all. Especially not the cover art, it was all very basic and obvious. One of these movies was Marley and Me, in which my expectations were very low. It looked like any other run of the mill movies that the entire ""family"" could enjoy or some movie like My Dog Skip or something like that. However, my expectations were blown out of the way even though it was very similar to My Dog Skip.I actually found the movie to be very entertaining and funny. It was a movie about life, not so much a cute animal flick. Anyone who has had to raise a dog while trying to start a family can relate to this story. If you love dogs or have ever owned one, you would also appreciate this movie.There were a few things that I did not like so much, although I can't remember too many right now. There was a long drawn out montage in the middle of the film in which I thought went on a tad too long. But, overall, I never really lost interest. It was touching and funny in many parts. I don't think, though, that I would necessarily watch again, at least not for some time.It was just a good movie.",Marley & Me
220,pineapple0808,"A bit pointless, but sort of good.",6,29 May 2009,"I had quite high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately i came out of the cinema sobbing and confused. Sobbing because, well, it's pretty heartbreaking, and confused because i didn't really get the message of the movie. I was hoping that i would come out thinking yes, dog really is man's best friend. Sadly i really didn't. For me the dog just caused problems throughout the whole movie and there was never a turning point where the dog stopped being annoying. I must say i did enjoy this movie even though i found it a bit slow and pointless, it would have been really good if their was a bit more to it and really strong meaning in the movie.",Marley & Me
221,puss_cat-1,"Don't believe the bad reviews, This film deserves a lot of praise.........",10,22 March 2010,"My husband and I caught this film very recently. You know what it's like, you see it advertised at the local cinema and don't get round to watching it then catch it on the TV later? I have to say firstly, you will read some reviews on this film that are scathing and cruel. One in particular had me reeling in disbelief as the film was slammed beyond all recognition. It will make you wonder if these people have any compassion or love in their bodies at all.I do feel it is very important to mention that if you do have any compassion or love in your bodies then you need to prepare yourself to watch a film that is ultimately going to have you sobbing at the end of it.This film charts the time in John Grogan's, (Owen Wilson) life from when he gets married to Jen, (Jennifer Aniston) to when they both reach 40 years old. It explores matters such as children, work, how to deal with things when it's all going a bit wrong and getting a dog and all the problems that come with that. At the time John is considering the facts about having children, but he talks things round a bit and decides he'll get a dog. And they get Marley. Marley is not the most well-behaved dog and is a destructive, naughty, cheeky animal that never really gets exactly how he should be behaving, (kind of reminds me of our own dog in some ways). He does lots of things he shouldn't do but John and Jen persevere with him, even when after a miscarriage, and 3 children later when their marriage is not running so good they could have given him up. In essence, they do not give up on him, as they do not give up on all the other challenges in their lives.It was about halfway through the film when my husband said to me, ""this is going to have a sad ending."" That it hit us that this was not some silly story about a badly behaved dog. And when John Grogan does eventually have to make the hardest decision of all with the beloved family pet, who has been there as a faithful companion for many years the tears started to flow. It was a very moving film and I have to admit we both cuddled our dog and showed him lots of love after it had finished. And it will probably make you do the same thing, or take him out for a walk, or do whatever he likes doing because it will make you realise just how much you love your four-legged friend.I really do recommend this film and have no hesitation in giving it a 10/10 as one of the best and saddest films I have seen in quite some time, that is really not quite what you would expect it to be........",Marley & Me
222,lunamargolis,One of the best films with dogs I've ever seen,10,22 December 2020,"Ever since our beautiful dog came to the family, nearly 6 years ago, I cannot keep myself from crying every time on the last 15 minutes of this movie. I don't know how to explain it, it just happens when it comes to that particular moment, and it is impossible for me to stop until the end",Marley & Me
223,pktbishop,There was sobbing...,9,26 December 2008,"Every year I go to see a movie on Christmas Day. It's been a tradition since high school. This year's Christmas movie was ""Marley & Me"". I was more excited by the fact that it was something that everyone could go and see; including my mom, who doesn't venture out to the theater very often. Anyway, I was happy that she and my girlfriend were excited to see this.As I am sure many posters will repeat this phrase, if you've ever been a dog owner, this movie really rings true. The movie itself is very simple; it chronicles the growth of a couple and the impact their pet Labrador has on their family throughout their life. It is really the simplicity that makes the story work so well. This isn't ""Old Yeller"" or ""Lassie"", though some elements are there. This isn't a dog movie focused on the relationship of the canine and a kid (a la ""My Dog Skip""). This is a true depiction of what it is like for most people to get a puppy early in their relationship and how it can develop into them becoming a member of the family.There aren't many people in the cast. Jennifer Aniston really does the best job in the picture. I'm a fan of Owen Wilson (I know many aren't), and it was nice to see a serious side since we really hadn't seen one since ""Behind Enemy Lines"". He did a good job, but he really would've sold me if he had shed some full on tears when it was required. But he was very believable nonetheless.The film really humanizes the characters and their relationship with Marley with such realism. I haven't had a chance to read the book, but I have a feeling the movie captured the essence of the story. I have been a dog owner my entire life. I had 5 from childhood through college and have experienced the beginning act of the movie having purchased a puppy with my girlfriend 2 years ago. He is now a 2 yr old member of our family, and we would be devastated if we ever lost him. Most can relate to the experience of being a pet owner, and even if you can't, there are messages here you can still connect with. I definitely recommend this for ANYBODY, but try to take the family. If you never wanted a pet before, I challenge you to not change your mind after viewing this. And yes, men, women and children alike were sobbing by the end",Marley & Me

225,alp1981,He'll steal your heart and probably chew it up too,8,25 December 2008,"It's not too often that I break down and sob in a movie theater like I did with Marley & Me but this is no ordinary film. Sure, this isn't a movie for the jaded film goers amongst us who are looking for layers and substance filled substance to dissect and interpret. Instead it's a formulaic family flick made by dog owners for other dog owners. It's also a love letter to our best friends who are the only ones in our lives to see us at our highest and our lowest and who love us no matter what.The film captured the way a dog can steal your heart and how they truly are a member of the family and it pulls all the right heart strings at all the right moments. But is it a good film? Dog lovers will be captivated by the experience and have their hearts broken in the last 20 minutes while everyone else will probably just see a mediocre date movie with a cute puppy and routine performance from Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson. Being amongst the former audience, I couldn't help but fall in love with the movie and I couldn't wait to get in my car and rush home to see my dogs.The dog lover in me gives this a 10/10 while the movie buff in me gives this a 6/10 so overall I guess that's about an 8/10.",Marley & Me
226,flowerwings,"The problem isn't the ""average family living an average life""",3,6 July 2009,"People have complained that this film is about an ""average family/mediocre people/average life"" and that is why it's boring, but that isn't what's wrong with it. Watching a film about an average family growing up can be really interesting, but in Marley and Me there was no connection between Aniston and Wilson as a couple, you heard none of their back story, the kids weren't given individual personalities, and overall the family doesn't seem like a family, just like actors pretending to be one. Partially the blame does go to Wilson and Aniston's acting, but overall I feel it was a problem with the script not having developed them as characters and stories too. The funny dog anecdotes didn't translate well to screen, whereas I'm sure the book is very funny and heartwarming to read. The film doesn't even achieve what the plot line says ""A family learns important life lessons from their adorable, but naughty and neurotic dog"", what life lessons did they learn? Where were they shown in the film? That film I would have enjoyed. The film was just underdeveloped, it doesn't matter that it was about an ""average family living an average life"" it could've have been a funny, heartwarming film, but it wasn't.",Marley & Me

228,kleinlau-1,Surprisingly Good Performances,8,8 June 2009,"I am a fan of Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston for the most part but I thought they were terribly miscast in their roles here. I was pleasantly surprised by them and by the movie on the whole. I did not believe they can do the book justice. I was mistaken. Both of the leads treated the material with proper respect it deserved. The editing, on the other hand, could have been better. The montage in the middle of the movie was a jarring note that broke the flow of the movie. I would have loved to have seen Marley more. My primary criticism of the movie. For all of that I found myself looking forward to reading the book again ... I miss my Marley. I can say I thoroughly enjoyed movie.",Marley & Me

Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are amazing! i think they're best couple on screen :) a bit of comedy tastes/sunny Florida location also very nice! the reason why we cried so hard was we had a beagle. she died this March when she's 11 y/o. she's so called bad bad dog(Lol) like Marley, we couldn't teach/train her anything. she's too naughty to broke a lot of stuff like carpet, curtain, slippers....although she was super cute. nobody's could hate her. she's just adorable. we love her so much. so this Marley is a lot like our beagle dog Winnie. Movie reminds us a lot, so touching. if you ever have/had a dog, you might feel the same way. this is a great movie!!!",Marley & Me

231,Stephen_in_Elkhorn,Each Great Movie Has Flaws,8,6 July 2009,"I rented ""Marley and Me"" one night at ten o'clock. I was home alone for the weekend and my friends were all busy so I sat down with my dog and my cat to watch this. Not gonna lie, this is one of the best ""dog"" movies I have seen in a while and I probably will buy it now.""Marley and Me"" is about a couple (Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson) who is starting off a new life in South Florida. When Jenny (Aniston) mentions having a kid, John (Wilson) decides to start off with a puppy instead. This puppy turns out to be ""the world's worst dog"" and quite frankly if I had this dog I might be saying the same thing.The story is more about the couple, the development of their family, and how the dog somehow keeps it together. The story has a great plot and a great script. There were some places where it was dragging and at some points it seemed a lot longer than what it really is, but nothing is perfect. Also in places were they skip ahead in time might confuse some about only for a couple minutes.The movie has great acting. Jennifer Aniston's acting might remind you of Rachel from ""Friends"" but in my eyes, the role called for it. She pulled off the emotions she needed without any flaws. Owen Wilson, however, played basically the same character he's played in everything else. I would've liked to see more depth in his acting, but what's done is done. The character of Sebastian, played by Eric Dane, was your usual player/best friend character; which he did play surprisingly good. The kids were all equally good (with the exception of Colleen, age 5, but she's young she still has time to grow into it). My sister made fun of how Patrick, age 10, (Nathan Gamble) delivered most of his lines. In his defense, when you are given bad, generic lines you do the best you can with them, I would know. I thought Gamble's performance was great, as usual.I am focusing more on the acting because I am a stage actor so it's out of habit.I won't spoil the ending though many can probably guess it already. It made me appreciate my pets a lot more. Overall the movie was **** out of *****.",Marley & Me

I had read the Parental Advisory on this site before going so I somewhat knew what to expect. What I didn't know is that it is more about the couple's relationship with each other than about the dog (it should've been called ""Jen and Me""). My daughter is 10 and picked up on the sex scenes more than I thought she would. I had no idea she knew what having sex is - so maybe this is a good thing to get us talking (she's had ""health"" education at school). My seven-year-old didn't understand but I think she enjoyed it less because it was a bit grown up, but she did like the scenes with the dog. If I had known ahead of time, I would not have taken them. Not that I'm so sorry I did and feel as though I've ruined their lives - I just wasn't as informed as I should have been.The ""foul"" language, ""violence"" and ""nudity"" did not bother me at all (put in quotes because I wouldn't use those labels myself, though others have).Itwas a good movie!

When i say a dog behaving badly it could seem funny for some people, but a dog eating a couch, running after other dogs, humping a leg just ain't funny anymore. Come up with something new guys!

It was just--*blah.Every 'happy' scene was immediately undermined by something sad, and the other way around; every touching scene was undermined by something goofy and stupid. (""Tee-HEE! The dog's humping! Tee-HEE!"") The plot contained about 4 genres (which it frequently switched between dozens of times). Romantic, drama, comedy, family... The plot definitely took me on a roller-coaster of emotions. (which is not necessarily a good thing).As my friend said: ""If this was a YouTube video, I'd be one of those annoying people who comments: 'Give me 3 minutes of my life back,' except it'd be 2 hours.""

In fact it was excellent.The animals in the movie were awesomely trained and performed very well. Both Wilson and Aniston do superb acting and really make me care about the characters of the movie. And that's also the problem.I'm a very sensitive person who really lose myself in movies. If something is happy i sit there staring with a big smile, and when something is sad i almost start to cry.This movie had pretty much everything i usually enjoy. Funny actors who really know how to act, a dog, family related problems, etc, etc.Still i can't help but be incredibly disappointed with the story. It starts well but gets worse at the end of the movie and starts a spiral into a complete crap where i honestly considered not watching the entire movie since i could foresee and predict what was going to happen.If you like drama movies, this is definitely something for you. If you're looking for a comedy (which i thought it was from the cover of the movie) this is a big NO NO!

Wilson and Aniston have done terrifically. And kudos to the crew for so excellently training the dog to an apt actor.

240,rpc68,A Simple Story of a Dog Turned Into A Good Movie,7,17 January 2009,"If you look at this movie from the outside, then all you see is a story of a canine. Though from the inside this movie becomes more than just a simple story of a man and his best friend. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston I would say made this movie into what it was with their down to Earth approach, one in which we can all usually relate to. Most people have owned at one time or another an animal in which they have learned to teach and learned from. What this movie does other than making us laugh and cry is that the movie is true to life. We learn from the movie that life is what it is and we all are born expecting to die someday. But it what we do within our life that leave's it's mark. And what Marley does through the movie is that exactly. So though this movie is simply about a dog and it may be over the top corny and cheesy, it is still worth seeing and is very entertaining. So grab your box of tissues, bring your spouse, and remember the first time you had a household pet.",Marley & Me

I got more than I was asking for... Once you see Marley grow up, you become really attached to the little guy. Then at the end, it had me, my date, and my friends all in tears. I was balling. This movie is far more than what I could have ever wanted, I usually don't cry during movies but I have a cat thats 17, and I thought about her, and what life without her would be like.

Now, so that I am not just ranting about something that is different to my taste, I am going to explain my problems. - There is no structure to the story. - The direction of photography is non existent. - The script is week (although realistically written). - The dog is a completely different dog throughout the film. Not just slightly different, but we are talking a different colour, size, shape of head.... everything. - It is not sad when the dog dies as it is a horrible dog anyway... I love dogs, but as a story goes, it is a good idea tot make the audience like the creature before it dies. - The characters should not own a dog. - The film is depressing but without any point. ..... just awful.. really bad.",Marley & Me

Although I thought there were some missed opportunities to be funnier, I laughed out loud many times despite knowing what was coming. I had a German Shepherd, Anka, who lived 14 years and never failed to provide unconditional love through some pretty troubled times. Seeing Marley deteriorate, taking that horrible final ride, waiting while the vet prepared the lethal injection and then saying goodbye while it entered his body forced me to relive the last hours of Anka's life and what has to go down as some of the most painful of mine. At first, I was angry that the movie forced me to experience that anguish of 6 years ago but as I was riding home my feelings changed to one of gratitude, because I remembered all the wonderful times we had together and how she ""told me"" it was time to let her go. I got home and hugged my dogs (another German Shepherd and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) and appreciated how lucky I've been to have always had these incredible companions in my life.",Marley & Me
245,bgrass49,One Lousy Movie,1,31 March 2009,"What a disappointment! After seeing the TV ads for Marley And Me, our niece's 4 year old daughter was SO excited to go see it. This movie is NOT suitable for young children.Don't see Marley And Me with the idea of seeing a sweet dog movie. There is really not even much of Marley in the movie, most of it is the ""Me"" part of ""Marley And Me"".I really can't think of anything good to say about this movie. And the end, where the dog dies, is terrible, and much, much too long and graphic. Very unpleasant indeed.I wouldn't recommend Marley And Me to anyone. As a dog lover, I find it awful. As a parent and grandparent, I wouldn't take a child to see this move.",Marley & Me
246,yendry,Marley & Me,8,21 April 2009,"This movie is very sad but with a lot of fun at the same time. I really enjoyed this movie because I like funny movies and this one is really fun. It's about a yellow lab named Marley of course; he is the worst dog ever. He was adopted by john Grogan played by Owen Wilson and his wife Jennifer Grogan played by Jennifer Aniston. He changed their life completely. It was not only because he destroyed everything in the house, he could not go out without made any trouble. For example in the movie there was a scene where they were in the car and John opened the window and Marley tried to jump out of the car, so they had to pull over. In this movie you can find a lot of feelings like happiness, sadness etc. I really recommended this movie for everybody it's an adorable film to enjoy with family and friends.",Marley & Me

249,gyruss77,Previews are VERY misleading...,1,1 January 2009,"I think the Marley & Me ads are VERY misleading. The screenplay was trash, and so was the editing. I can understand that the filmmakers wanted to follow the book as closely as possible, but there was no need for showing that dog getting put down in the end, the way they did. Also, the movie couldn't make up it's mind if wanted to be a comedy, or a drama. Very poor writing indeed. Furthermore, there were sexual situations not appropriate for all family viewers. But the real tragedy of this film was it's terrible, terrible ending. It's too bad though, because with more care with the script, it could have been a really great film.I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Period. ANY kid, would be traumatized after viewing that horrible ending. Two thumbs down, for Marley & Me.",Marley & Me
250,cs188-bg,it's OK.,7,23 January 2009,"i thought this was going to be a movie about the deep connection between human and dog. in some respects it is. but most of the time we just see marley running around, causing havoc.. and wonder why are these 2 people still keeping this dog as a pet? this movie is really about owen Wilson and jennifer aniston going through the transition of adulthood.. newlyweds->new parents->jobs changing->regret for lost time and past decisions and finally acceptance of your life and family.i don't really think the dog, marley, helped convey any of these messages. he was just there, making a mess of things. i'm not sure how exactly owen Wilson learned any life lessons from his dog, other than that he was around during the process. i have a feeling the book was better in getting these ideas across.after seeing some reviews about people crying at the end, i was expecting some tearjerker.. but actually the ending was done very subtly and not as emotional as i thought. i didn't really find it all that sad, but i think it'll be more touching for pet owners and dog lovers.i am surprised this movie is rated pg as there is the use of the s**t word and jokes about cutting off b**ls, and some light foreplay scenes between the 2 leads. but then again, the ratings board has relaxed over the yrs. this move would have been pg-13 if it was released 10-15 yrs ago.",Marley & Me
251,topdog-5,An OK movie but not as great as I'd hoped,5,22 April 2009,"As a dog lover, I expected to really love Marley & Me but I didn't really relate. I've had dogs my whole life and sometimes we've had difficult dogs but they can be trained - at least to not be as unmanageable and destructive as Marley is for far too long. It was hard for me to believe that the characters kept buying new couches and cleaning their carpets and were naive enough to bring babies into a house with such an uncontrollable dog.Still, it was a well done film. I did enjoy the acting although Owen Wilson seemed to be playing Owen Wilson as usual. It was good light entertainment and certainly not unpleasant, just nothing I would watch again. And actually, the only part that made me cry was when Jennifer Aniston's character had a miscarriage near the beginning.",Marley & Me
252,drhender-1,"Not necessarily a ""Family Movie"" as advertised",6,26 December 2008,"I saw the movie with grandkids aged 5 through 12. I had listened to the audiobook and enjoyed it very much. After listening to the book, it seemed to be what could have been a family movie. John Grogan's storytelling in the book made Marley seem both incorrigible and lovable. The movie, it seemed, spend more time on John Grogan's angst about his career, inferred angst about his loss of bachelorhood, and his anxiety about having and taking care of kids. In proportion, the movie, ""Marley & Me"", was mostly Me with Marley thrown in almost as a subplot. There did not seem to be much humor, what there was, often being crude, in my opinion. There was, of course, some sadness at the end. From feedback I got from the grandkids, the 5 and 8 year old were amused by some of Marley's antics, but bored with the rest of the plot. The 12 year old could appreciate more of the personal interactions that often seemed to overshadow the dog story.Bottom line: As usual, the book was better than the movie and seemed to stay more on topic. The movie version was hijacked by screenwriters who had some other view on the story other than Marley and John Grogan. While advertised as a ""family movie"", I would say that it was more of a 12 and older movie.",Marley & Me
253,Heptite,How do we make a movie that is guaranteed to make money? Make it about a dog!,2,14 August 2012,"Oh, look, another emotionally manipulative movie about a dog. Never mind that the story is weak and really rather tiresome. The dog! THE DOG! Automatic positive reviews from everybody because of the misbehaving dog that eventually dies. Oh no! Cutting onions!Owen Wilson is—unfortunately—a mid-range actor at best, and Jennifer Aniston is even worse, but even with more talented actors I doubt this story could have been rescued.While there were a few somewhat amusing moments, they were few enough, and not amusing enough to remotely make up for the dullness of having to watch this couple make everyday life decisions, and the predictability of what was going to happen with Marley. Failed attempt at obedience school? Check. Angry dog sitter? Check. ... Eventually dies? Check.",Marley & Me
254,livknight,Wow. The BEST canine movie ever.,9,21 April 2014,"I still remember purchasing Marley & Me when I was in the second grade. I read the book and it was instantly my favourite ever and still is to this day. I was so excited when it came out in the cinema and I still remember my front row seats when I was just nine. I am now fifteen and when my friend asked me what sad movie she should watch I suggested Marley & Me; the minute I mentioned it I knew I had to watch it again and see if I would still love it just as much. I loved it even more. It brought me laughs, memories and so, so many tears. At the end of the film my face was bright red and puffy. This movie is a winner and if you think you're a dog lover test yourself and watch this film. I love dogs and always have, and this movie will really make you realise just how much of a huge impact dogs have on our lives. It is so enjoyable and is a mixture of everything great; emotion, humour and love. The actors bring out the best in the characters; animal and people. Do yourself a favour and buy a block of chocolate, a box of tissues and a copy of Marley & Me. And don't forget to have your pooch right by your side so you can bury yourself right into their fur when it ends.",Marley & Me
255,mountain_walrus,Don't waste your time.,1,2 January 2009,"This is not a very good movie. Maybe I was expecting something different, but it is not worth the price of admission and the time you will never get back.There is maybe one laugh the entire movie but it is very weak. It doesn't have a strong plot, a rising action, or a climax. It is not exciting. It just tells a few years of a family with their dog. That wouldn't be so bad if the dog was likable. Half of the time I found myself wishing that the family would just get rid of the dog. Marley was never funny and just bothersome and annoying. You won't like this movie. Especially if you are watching it to see an Owen Wilson comedy. It is just a non interesting, non funny, boring story. You won't like it. The only exception is if you absolutely love dogs and not just good dogs, but stupid dogs. So if you like annoying, misbehaving, evil dogs then watch it. You also have to enjoy boring, non funny stories to like it.",Marley & Me

We were wrong! This movie is way too much of the opposite. There is just too much realistic, sad situations in this movie to make it a nice family movie. We wanted to be entertained, not to bring on sad emotions. I think like us, everyone thought this movie was going to be a happy movie. No, you end up re-living the horrible sad feelings of having a pet die. But I am sorry to say that if I had known that, I wouldn't have PAID to see this movie and feel that way AGAIN. I know it's way better when you come out feeling good and happy about a movie and looking forward to buying the DVD when it comes out. BUT NOT THIS MOVIE. They had a great idea for the movie, but they should have re-read the script before releasing it with the depressing feeling it leaves you with. I know more people would have been happy and would even want to buy it for their children to watch again and again if they would have thought about that first, and made it more light hearted and cute.",Marley & Me
257,rocksandgems-82572,Best Movie Ever Made!,10,15 November 2015,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. I love the fact that it is all about family including the pet dog and how a pet is also just as much a part of the family and it's just as upsetting when a pet dies. My favourite part is when they decide to take Marley to obedience training and the woman who runs it decides to show them how to walk a dog, she tries to walk Marley and he runs off after some Sea Gulls, she then blows a whistle and Marley runs back towards her and jumps up on her and she falls to the ground and Marley humps her leg. After that she is quite upset so she kicks Marley out of obedience school. When it comes up to the part when Marley is sick, is when I start to get tears in my eyes. When John (Owen Wilson) takes Marley to the vet and the veterinarian tells him that Marley needs to be put to sleep, and John sits with him and tells him what a great dog he is etc, is just so so sad! I have watched this movie more times than I can count on my hands and still cry every time. I love Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson and think they make a really lovely couple.",Marley & Me

Just bring a box of tissues,10,28 December 2008,"Okay so i love love loved this movie! it beautifully depicts a families life and the struggle's that a young couple goes through. It starts out with Marley being the center of their life, but as children come life becomes more complicated and Marley (alough still important to the movie) takes a back seat to the children. It is beautifully shot and i honestly have never cried so much in a movie in my life.The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston is amazing. they click and the acting is impeccable. They honestly show the struggles that a couple goes through and show how hard life with each other, children, and Marley.The ending is done beautifully, and shows how much a dog really impacts a family and helps them to grow and love. I suggest this movie to families, young couples, old couples, and anyone else! Bravo Owen and Aniston. Bravo.",Marley & Me

260,dmontano55,I Disagree with the critics pertaining to this movie,8,26 December 2008,"So much of this movie seemed so real. It takes a lot to bring up a dog especially one that is uncontrollable as Marley. But when you think about it, only a dog lover knows what's involved. But when you think about what this dog brings to your life, it's unmearsurable to what a human can bring. It's unconditional. Show him your heart and he'll show you his. It's the other way around. He'll show you his heart before you show his yours. I left the theatre crying. I know what it's like to put down a dog and having to make that difficult decision as to what would be better for them. You decide whether they should live or die. It's a very difficult decision to make especially one that gives you unconditional love. I felt the movie was very true as how we react to our day to day lives with out dogs. I don't recommend this for children because it's a movie that's in long run very hard to swallow,but it teaches us that our dogs will do anything for us with absolutely expecting nothing in return. As long as you feed them and give them water, you will have a best friend for life. It may have not been the best movie of the season, but it sent a very strong message. It doesn't matter what you do or who you are, I will always be by your side as long as I live.",Marley & Me
261,karl-66,A horrible film,2,6 April 2009,"I really dislike this film. The acting was wooden with the main characters seeming to hate being in the movie. I am a dog lover but from 5 minutes after they purchased the dog I wanted them to kill it. All through the movie I wanted them to take the dog to the vet and have them put him down. They don't show the dog doing one nice thing in the movie. They put so much other crap into this film as filler, the relationship with the friend reporter, the boss, the failed pregnancy... all terrible crap.The only way this movie could have been worse was if Uwe Boll had directed it.",Marley & Me
262,lauren-anderson-1,What a pleasant surprise!,8,18 October 2009,"First and foremost I want to say that the trailers didn't do this movie justice. Originally when I saw the trailers, I thought, ""oh, another dumb movie"", this time about a guy with a crazy dog. I expected slap stick humor and that Owen Wilson would use the dog to pick up women, etc.Today flipping through channels on a rainy afternoon I landed on it. And there was so much more to Marley & Me than the trailers let on. What a sincerely touching film.This is a story about a man and his dog. But it's also a story about the love we have for our pets, and more importantly, growing up, starting a family and letting life take its course.John and Jenny's relationship with their dog, Marley, is a backdrop to their life together. ********LIGHT SPOILER******** They bought the dog when they were just starting out. And throughout the years, through miscarriages, children, jobs, moves, and life, their dog was there, sharing every moment of it. A genuinely touching moment comes at the end when John realizes how much a part of the family Marley was. ********END OF SPOILER******* Movies so often speak to us when are at a point in our lives that we can relate. I rescued my cat three years agofrom the SPCA while living overseas. Since moving back to the States (with my cat, Nala), I've lived in several different cities, gotten married, and now me and my husband are starting a family of our own. But I joke that we already have our first child. As much as she can annoy us, life wouldn't be the same without her. Eventually, Nala will be gone -- I suspect by then we'll have a few kids, a house of our own, and our careers will have grown-- not much unlike John & Jenny. But the memories I have with her (when we were on our own so far away-- just me and her) and the memories that our new family will create together, will always remain with me.This movie was as much about starting a family and coming to realize what's truly important in life, as it was about the special place our pets hold in our heart-- the way they make you laugh and are there for you when you cry.Marley & Me was a surprisingly touching, and sometimes sad movie, but one that makes you feel good-- about the paths you've chosen in life, family and the relationship you have with your most loyal and dependable friend-- your pet.",Marley & Me

After about 15 minutes I was hoping to come down with dysentery so I could leave and not get the death look from the girlfriend. I saw Old Yeller as a kid and it didn't suck. Marley and me, however, did. When my girlfriend is ripping on a movie for being too sappy, you know that it is contrived. What? She couldn't have told me she hated it before it ended? Dang.

266,doubleedgemedia,Brainwashed viewers!,3,2 January 2009,"OK, so you all think ""Marley and Me"" is such a heartwarming movie. Wow, I cannot believe how dumbed-down American audiences have become, especially with this film.(And even my friends who think Jim Carrey's ""Yes Man"" is hilarious). Here's what happens...Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston get married. He works, she raises a family, and there is a dog involved. A dog that has no discipline that destroys everything in sight (for years without reprimand) and has no loyalty to his owners except for one lap-laying scene with Jen.We could care less about this couple --their children are shown as nuisances rather than developing humans. Their dog is a monster. Owen Wilson is a stubborn a-hole at his job. Only Jen Aniston shows any emotion in this dreck. Wow, watch the audience guffaw when Marley destroys a house, a garage, a restaurant, etc. However, when it comes time for the inevitable scene we all paid our money to see...we feel terrible.It's like we are flagellating ourselves for our own pets. We KNOW from the book that Marley dies, and when that scene comes, we have the hankies ready and sit through the end credits so no one will see our red and puffy eyes when leaving as the ushers wait with brooms and dustpans. But we are not crying for Marley --we are crying for our own companions, especially those of us with aging pets whose demise we know we are going to have to face.I cannot tell you the number of screaming children who needed parental therapy on leaving the theater after watching this marketed ""Family-Friendly Dog Film"". WORST FILM of the holiday season --go see ""Slumdog Millionaire"" instead if you want to walk out feeling inspired and light on your feet.",Marley & Me

For the longest time, i regretted it. But now, i understand why.This wasn't the movie that first put me to tears, but this is for sure this was the first movie that made me cry so hard in the end.Contrary to comments of other users, i found the movie to have subtly convey the message to its audience. The movie wanted us to see and feel unconditional love. despite of all the bad things that the dog Marley has done, they still loved him like their own child, a real part of their family.I haven't read the book yet, but after watching the film, i wanted to read it right away.",Marley & Me
268,sloblock,Quick Review,1,28 March 2009,"Virtually no character development, no story and strangest of all, not about a dog.What should be key elements of the film seem like incidentals. Life changing moments are just odd lines or chance meetings. there is no depth to the story or any characters in it. What is play as a central theme (or as close as it gets to one) is the usual 'I have given up my chance to be someone, do something, but I wont because I love you'. Frankly, you wont even care, because if you blink once or twice and miss a couple of lines, then you wont even notice this angle in the film.Ironically, the dog seems like an incidental. Apart from showing it cant walk on a lead, it only has 3 scenes at the end of the film which appear to have been thrown in at the last minute.The whole film smacks of a post production review meeting where they realised what a boring film they had made and asked for more 'dog moments'. Unfortunately it appears they forgot about the dog 'sub-plot' during filming. As a result the movie is neither one thing or another. Complete boring mess. I feel cheated out of the cost of cinema tickets and the two hours wasted watching it... and I love and have always owned dogs.",Marley & Me

And there were a few more than just 4 bad words spoken and the individual that repeated those words in his/her post didn't accurately report the words that were used. They are obviously desensitized to foul language. There is nothing wrong with protecting your kids from hearing this kind of language any more than they already do. Garbage in = Garbage out.

I think a lot of people went into it thinking it would be another typical dog movie like Benji or Beethoven. It is so much more. This is a story about real life and real experiences. It chronicles the life of an honest to goodness real family and how the dog was a part of that family. It shows the ups and downs of growing older and finding out what is really important in life. Some have said that it is more graphic than need be. But I found the emotional reality to be a good thing. I'm glad it wasn't sugar-coated. No, this movie shouldn't be viewed as a ""family movie."" It deals with real life adult issues. Just because a movie is rated PG does not mean that it is meant for children.

271,anno_malia,must love dogs,5,5 July 2009,"Really, you must be crazy about dogs if you want to see this movie. And if you want to enjoy it. And if you want to get to the end without falling asleep.I was expecting a fun, light, Sunday-evening romance, what I got was a (relatively) quick-paced beginning, with a seemingly endless background story for the rest of the movie, which had nothing to to with either Marley or the main character (sorry for not giving names, I am trying to forget this movie asap).DO see it if you really, I mean really love dogs or if you have a dear pet or simply if you are a hopeless sentimental. Or if you are a SIMS fan and you like to see how others are doing in real life.DO NOT see it if you are depressed, recently divorced or if your pet has just died.What I liked: good acting, good image. What I did not like: length (amazing sleep-inducing 115 minutes), incomplete story (some sequences of the script that are later referenced in the movie are not very well developed in the first place), casting of dogs (which were so obviously dissimilar from one scene to the next that I kept wondering if there was a second dog in the story somewhere), pace (too slow, really! - TOO SLOW)What I learned: that some dogs are bad and we still love them, that some families are amazingly functional despite their quarrels, that people move from one place to another, that mothers leave jobs when a second child is born...Bottom line, a movie I personally did not enjoy, a movie that wants to be both a comedy and a psychological introspection of family life, but fails miserably at both.",Marley & Me

There are some funny moments and some ""I can relate to that"" moments, but all in all, the movie lacked one mildly important aspect, a plot. Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting for the reason the movie was made. It never came. The character development was so-so; I never really grew attached to the main characters and certainly not to the kids. The Grey's Anatomy Dr. came in and out of the movie with no real relationship development. The acting was mediocre as well. I like both Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, but the acting seemed contrived and disingenuous. That said, the movie was entertaining and somewhat funny.

Just some 'real life' facts about the 'worst dog ever'. The whole film i was thinking about Beethoven dog and how this Marley sucks comparing to it. Really, he doesn't do anything bad in particular, just some boring stuff every dog (even mine) does from time to time like chewing shoes and humping furniture.

Marley reminds me a lot of my dog Chaney who was a loyal canine friend for almost 12 years. Its been almost two years since he passed away from a nerve disorder. I miss him very much. I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the pairing of Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson and the supporting actors were all very funny and convincing in their roles. Kathleen Turner as the dog trainer was fun to watch! The end was very sad but it was a joy to watch this dog share his life with his beloved family. I recommend this movie for any dog lover. The soundtrack is very good especially Bob Marley. Of course that is how the dog was named.,Marley & Me
277,hot_like_mexico,This movie was surprisingly good!,9,31 December 2008,"I tried to read the book. Got a little bored with it, though, so I stopped.But I didn't let that stop me from going to see the movie. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston make a cute couple, and they have good chemistry. Marley was a cute dog at first, and while some of his antics were hilarious, I ended up feeling more annoyed with him than entertained. (Especially when he drives Jenny to her breaking point.) But when Marley was in his final days, man I let the tears flow! And when memories with Marley were being recalled, all while he was being put to sleep, my cousin and I were on the borderline of bawling like babies. In the end, I realized that Marley was a damn good dog,; a dog that truly was ""man's best friend."" Anyone who has a pet or has experienced loss will surely relate to this movie. But, don't get me wrong- it was also filled with many happy moments of a couple's journey together, starting with marriage and watching their children grow.THIS REGARDS THE WHOLE ""NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN"" ARGUMENT: To be honest, yes, cuss words are used in this movie. But they are done pretty tastefully. Nothing kids haven't heard already. There are some sexual parts, but they do not show anything besides kissing and leave the movie-goer to piece the rest together themselves. Overall, this movie is a family movie! Kids sure got a kick out of Marley in the theater I was at.",Marley & Me
278,rahul_basla,You can't stop yourself from crying,8,21 March 2009,"I Usually love movies which Portray a relationship of a man and his dog. So i saw the movie with the same interest but i have to say that this is like no other movie, it is unique in its own form. Wilson and Aniston have done a great job in the movie and so have the other actors as well.This is the best movie of a man and his loyal friend(DOG) till now.I felt a very strong connection with the movie as i am a dog owner and lover. The Direction of the movie by David Frankel is amazing. If you haven't seen the movie go ahead and give it a try you won't regret it. Watching the movie will make you feel good especially if you are a dog lover. Marley and me is definitely one of the best movies of the 2008.",Marley & Me
279,angelrose971,Viewers Be Ware!,1,30 December 2008,"I think the first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that I highly recommend children ages 12 and under NOT attend. (I have called everyone I know with children and professed this belief and as parents, they are grateful that I did.) Hence, the given rating of PG is understandable (could possibly even be PG-13 due to content like pregnancy, miscarriage, pregnancy tests, pet death) but what is not understandable is that the previews make it seem like a comedy (and it does have its funny parts) but the movie has a truly horrific ending that is played out for what felt like the last 30 minutes and left EVERYONE in the theater in tears (guys, too and they know they were). I will also admit that I knew the animal passed at the end, because of the book, but the way it was portrayed was just plain awful.I base a good movie on if I want to go see it again and I WOULD NOT go see it again, nor would I ever rent or buy it.What was supposed to be a very fun afternoon for me and my three daughters ages 10, 15 and 17, ended with all of us crying and me trying to comfort my youngest who was sobbing (along with every other parent in the place).If anything, the previews are truly to blame. This movie is not for the tender-hearted.",Marley & Me
280,vladstroescu,I slept through the whole thing,5,30 May 2009,"A snooze fest with no plot in it. Honestly, I didn't get this film. A guy and his wife and an ill mannered neutered Labrador that pees and poops all over the place. And a baby, somewhere along the way. And that's about it. Nothing really happens. I tried hard (until I fell asleep) to find ""the important lessons in life"" the tag line had promised me. Nope, nothing in the life lesson department either, not that I was a big life-lessons-from-the-movies kind a guy to begin with. Owen Wilson is usually a funny guy. In this movie, he probably would have been funny, if he had at least half a funny line to tell. The movie supposed to be after a book, well, I didn't read that book, but I'm sure it's no Dostoevsky. Don't go to this film, unless you're really tired and got no place else to sleep.",Marley & Me
281,mashedtater33,What can i say...,7,4 January 2009,"It's easy to think that just being a guy means you should never, ever, let a movie bother you in the least bit. But to be honest, seeing Marley and Me made me want to go home and play with my dogs from as soon as you first see the main characters buy the puppy to the predictable ending. Based on a book by John Grogan, coincidentally (but probably purposely) one of the main character's names, the movie evidently stays true to the original storyline, after summarizing and explaining the movie to people who have read the book.John Grogan (Owen Wilson) attempts to adjourn his wife, Jennifer Grogan's (Jennifer Anniston), hopes to have a baby by buying her a dog. They were told that boy dogs were $275, and girls were $300 while looking to buy a puppy from a litter of Labrador Retrievers. As a seemingly innocent dog nestles his way into Jennifer Grogan's arms, she falls in love with it and happily finds out that the owner of the dogs would sell this particular dog for $75 off. I only wish the couple had been told as I have been told maybe a million and a half times, 'If it's too good to be true it probably is'. So sure enough, the dog was as eating stuff quicker than piranhas eat those animals on Discovery. It was ripping apart the house and actually amazing the couple at how destructive it was becoming. I bet at some points in the dog's life the couple and their family would rather have bought ""Kujo"" than Marley.The movie is a touching romantic story, interlaced with a story about what could be, as John Grogan puts it, the worst dog in the world. You are left with a sorrowful, but proud smirk about your face while leaving the theater until you remember they really only bought that dog because they got a discount, right?",Marley & Me
282,chrissydoll85,Heart warming and excellent choice for anniston and Wilson,8,10 January 2009,"This was a truly great and heart warming movie. This was a great comeback for Jennifer and a really good chance for her to stick it to the tabloids and show how talented she is. This was a surprise role for Owen Wilson who plays a mature family man whose affections extend greatly to his dog. This film chronicles the life of a married couple their pet and their children. It shows the real ups and downs of marriage. The dog provides for comic relief and he was just so adorable in the film. This is a good movie to take your family to especially for dog lovers. The true lesson I picked up from the film is how important family is and how lucky one can be to have a loving pet who doesn't care what you look like or if your rich or poor. It was well acted and again provided for a career comeback for Anniston. I think she's making great choices in her life and the tabloids have her all wrong. She's beautiful, toned, a great actress, filthy rich, and seems to have a comfortable life. I read an interview and she also has a couple of dogs. This movie had me in tears, and it's presents a positive outlook on family life and the importance of not quitting the people and animals you love.",Marley & Me
283,wendlle-1,Movie with so many feelings,9,1 June 2009,"At first I thought that this movie would just bring me to tears as I am an animal person who lost my best friend (my dog) 6 months ago. I was really hesitant in watching it because of this, but even though it bought me to tears (and I mean full blown bawling) it made me laugh and laugh especially since my new dog, a beagle, is exactly like Marley.This movie isn't just about a dog, it is about family and how our lives change without us realising it. I think that Owen Wilson is at his best in this role. I totally believed that he and Jennifer Anniston were a married couple. I urge everyone who is and isn't a dog person to check it out as you won't be disappointed.",Marley & Me
284,VendettaVarun,Surprisingly heart-warming and good.,7,17 February 2009,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought this is going to be another cheesy romance comedy with a dog as an excuse for slapstick jokes.But no, it turned out to be a heart-warming tale of life, dreams and happiness. Looking at the cast of Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson, you might be expecting a straight-off-the-assembly-line chick flick. But no, this movie actually surprises you.Now for production values. The cinematography, direction is what it needs to be for this type of movie. The story is great. The character development is amazing in this movie and you start to feel sorry for the characters when they're down. Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson both did a wonderful job with their characters. Even the dog was great.The bad: Some plot points were left abruptly and were not clarified by the end of the movie. Some parts were just TRYING to be funny.Now I usually don't like comedy/romance movies at all. But this one is unique, and that's where it's beauty shines.Go watch it. Great fun for your entire family.Varun Kannan (14 years old)",Marley & Me
285,cintan1981,Harsh Reality of Man's Best Friend,9,19 December 2008,"Adapted from John Grogan's debut bestselling book, Marley & Me is a painfully realistic portrayal of life and death as seen through the relationship of a young writer ""John Grogan"" (Owen Wilson) and his loyal Labrador retriever companion Marley.Shortly after the honeymoon phase has passed, John and Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston) decide to fill a void in their lives, or so they think. However, life derails their plains. To help fill the void, John and Jennifer decide to start their family with a cute and energetic puppy named Marley. The mischievous Marley chronicles the life, career and marriage of John Grogan.The dynamics of the relationship between John and Jennifer is also remarkable. Had Marley not been such an integral part of the Grogan family; their relationship may not have survived. Sebastian (Eric Dane), John Grogan's best human friend, is the classical antithesis and a reminder of the freedoms of bachelorhood. Not until the chance encounter with Sebastian in Philadelphia, do we see the completeness John has in his life with Jennifer, the kids and Marley.A simple story coupled with a superb cast, make Marley & Me a must see. Wilson's portrayal of Grogan is a welcome change from the often silly and one dimensional characters Wilson has become known for. Equally compelling is the character Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston). At times, it is often indistinguishable between the character Jennifer Grogan and the person Jennifer Aniston. It was almost as if Jennifer Aniston threw down the script and put her own life on screen as Jennifer Grogan.While the story and acting are superb, Marley & Me is not the feel good Christmas cheer me up movie of the year. Not a dry eye in the theater for those old enough to have endured the sad reality of outliving a beloved pet. Imagine the heartache of Old Yeller multiplied by 10. An excellent movie for pet lovers, newlywed couples and those searching for the meaning of life.",Marley & Me
286,larrye1,ending too graphic,2,25 December 2008,"Marley and me was a fair film. but the ending scenes are too intense for a pg ratingthe movie did not have to show the vet injecting the drug to put down Marley. also the scene showing the actual burial of the dog was not necessary, and was very disturbing for young viewers.as a matter of fact, the two scenes were too intense for adults.i appreciate the fact that the book by john grogan was very detailed, but the screenwriters did not have to actually script the scenes like that.i observed many adults asking their children if they were OK as they left the theater.",Marley & Me
287,Rakerizah,Not what I expected...,10,26 December 2008,"After Christmas Dinner last night, my family members decided that it would be a good idea to go see this movie. A few of them had read the book and loved it. Feeling obligated to family, I of course went to go see it with them. However, my expectations for it were fairly low to be honest. I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Aniston's work and while funny, I feel that Owen Wilson is only capable of playing himself in the movie roles he's taken on. The same could probably be said for Jennifer Aniston to a degree as well.I was absolutely enthralled with this film though. As I'm sure most current and former dog owners were. The script was very solid and well structured to involve all the characters in Marley's life as an important part of it. The realistic connections made between the character's made the joy, comedy, frustrations, and even sadness demonstrated in this story very significant and personal. The story of Marley and his life with his family could not have been told any better. I would say my favorite scene in this movie was when Marley was let off his leash at the doggie beach, so he could run out to swim in the ocean.This movie gives a completely realistic portrayal of just how much love and joy a pet can bring to your life, and how significant ""Man's Best Friend"" values their relationships with their owners. I would recommend this movie to all but with a stern warning that this movie will pull at your heart strings very hard with it's realistic depiction of dealing with the loss of a loved one. Very few movies I've watched in my life have connected with me on a personal level strong enough to actually bring tears to my eyes. This movie however had my face covered with streams.",Marley & Me
288,otakuusaradio,"This is a good movie, but there is a warning:",10,26 December 2008,"You have to be an animal lover, most especially a dog person, to really understand what this movie is about. People complain there wasn't enough of Marley himself. that is never what this movie was meant to be. It was the memoirs of John Grogan, and what his life was like living with his friend Marley, and how Marley changed his view of life, love, family and friendship forever. Marley, the world's worst dog, because the most unforgettable friend the Grogans would ever know, and they are the better for it.Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson had magical on screen chemistry, and did a fantastic job bringing the emotions from the book, and translating them to the big screen. I have no complaints about the cast what-so-ever.**Spoilers** John Grogan opens his life completely and rawly in both his book and the movie adaptation. The miscarriages, the stabbing of his neighbor, his families struggles, their joys, and in the end, he shares the rawest of all emotions, the loss of a companion who had been there through it all.In the movie, Marley is Euthanised... and we are there for every step of the process. This has upset many pet lovers. Why? because they've had to go through it, and it's the worst moment of anyone's life.But that's the point. When my dog had to be put down, we were all there with him to let him know his suffering was over and that he didn't have to worry about us anymore. And there was a moment in his eyes where I could see the pain lift and I knew he understood. We needed to be there because we loved him.It's the same reason we needed to be there for Marley and for John, who opened their lives to us. THAT is why the scene was so vital. We needed to be there from beginning to end. This is a fact of life that all pet owners must face, as harsh of the reality as it is.If you think that the scene mentioned in the spoiler is too raw, and that the squeaking of the bed is too sexually graphic... don't watch TV. I've seen Axe body spray and KY lubricant commercials that are more in your face graphic playing at all times of the day, including when kids would normally be home from school. I've seen TV shows where there is back side nudity and sexual innuendo much more graphic than a squeaking bed.",Marley & Me
289,jrockusradio,A few things I'd have added...,9,26 December 2008,"(Spoiler alert) I really enjoyed the movie. I know a lot of people complain that it wasn't a feel good holiday movie (which is sad cause they missed the point of the movie then. It wasn't all about the end.) However, I agree it would have been nice if it didn't end on such a downer.The way I would have ended it is by adding the part on the book ""Marley and Me"" Where John receives an outpouring of sympathy from his readers who have followed his articles on Marley. They sent him memories of their own pets, and related to how he was feeling after losing Marley.Then I would have showed him at the very end getting a package, saying something like ""It's here!"" and his wife telling him how wonderful it looked. Then he puts the package on the table, and as they walk away the camera pans to the book ""Marley and Me"" or to have had something about him actually writing the book.That would have been a more upbeat way of ending it. Had they done that, they'd have gotten a 10 out of 10 instead of a 9 out of 10.Other than that, great movie, touching, heartfelt, great cast, lots of emotion, lots of chemistry. I enjoyed it being someone who has, and has been around pets all my life.",Marley & Me

Kathleen Turner and Alan Arkin should be embarrassed to be seen in a movie this bad. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Anniston belong in this film because my expectation for them is so low. No talent required to be in this film. Absolutely no plot, no character development, none of the elements of the most basic movie. An hour and a half of ""It's Me or the Dog"". We never get a chance to care about any of the characters, not even the dog. How Scott Frank could be involved in such a lame presentation is surprising. Many opportunities for some great comedy with the puppy are simply bypassed. More opportunities for true conflict with Jennifer Anniston and Owen Wilson characters are ignored. No love story, no adventure, contrived comedy without any setup or punch and no conflict. Lazy writing, substandard directing and half hearted acting make this a disappointment that doesn't deserve a second thought.",Marley & Me

This is just like Lassie except if it was made by John Waters and Roger Corman. STAY AWAY.

The movie was advertised in a way that would suggest comedy throughout the film. However, the movie changed its tone throughout and was inconsistent with what I was led to believe as a Christmas movie for the family to watch. It started off great but wow...After watching the movie it was very clear that the dog was not apart of the main storyline. The movie focused more on Owen Wilson's character and his struggles in what he considered a boring job.

You have a relationship with your pet for 10-15 years and seeing then go is not easy.Honestly there isn't much of a love story, and i didn't laugh very often but the movie was still amazing. to quote John Grogan ""A dog doesn't care if you are rich or poor, educated or illiterate, clever or dull.Give him your heart and he will give you his.""

This movie should have been rated PG-13 due to the sexual innuendos, language, and inappropriate scenes for kids under the age of 10. At one point in the movie, Anniston and Wilson are in Ireland on vacation and are consistently talking about sex and the scene turns to them doing the deed on a very squeaky bed with religious pictures all over the walls. Additionally, discussions about having sex in order to practice for having a child. They are then in bed getting hot and heavy when the dog interrupts. I don't care about the conversation but the text of it was pretty harsh that my 8 year old was holding her ears. Other scenes with lots of instances of the word ""Ass"", ""Bitch"", or other curses. Also Anniston and Wilson have a miscarriage during the film. Had to explain that one to an 8 year old. Not a very kid friendly movie.

Instead, I was offended that the owners, in their ignorance, set this poor dog up for failure. He is portrayed as 'bad' when, in fact, he is not bad, it is his owners who are bad. Right from the start they did everything wrong with this poor dog. They got him for the wrong reason and they did no reading in preparation for dog ownership. They did not have a crate to properly transport him in the car, no bed for him at home. How could any being be locked in a garage and not suffer from anxiety? I did not find this funny. In fact, there were many times when their treatment of him came close to abuse. Marley was not a bad dog, he was a frustrated and anxious dog. Marley didn't have a particularly happy life, but being the wonderful animal he is, he survived despite the stupidity of his owners. I am concerned that families who are considering a dog will view this movie as a role model and think this is the way to treat an animal - when it is not.PS I notice that your listing of characters for this movie has no mention of ""Marley"", who he is or who his trainers are. I had read that there were 22 Marleys involved in the filming. This would be interesting to know more about.",Marley & Me
297,veganhead,Complete doggy doodle!,2,26 February 2009,"Marley and Me is the story of an untrainable, yet lovable Laborador named Marley and the impact he has on a young family that grows up around him. The beginning of the film is cringingly cheesy as Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston) ticks off things from her meticulously planned life schedule; marry: tick, Job: tick, new house: tick. The movie gets lets sickeningly perfect when the couple take home a new puppy who they call Marley, ""a clearance puppy""(Who is sold at a bargain price for a reason) and they have to deal with this crazy, and hilarious monster who eats everything (including phone answering machines and brief cases). Marley is really the only good thing about the film and this is highlighted by the fact that the high point of John Grogan's (Owen Wilson)career occurs when he writes about the humorous antics of Marley. The couple's attempts to be as cute as their dog fail miserably. Their relationship is boring because it is too perfect and even the holiday they take to Ireland is clichéd and unrealistic with a horrific attempt at an Irish accent by the woman who owns the BnB. Of course 'the luck of the Irish' as the cause of Jennifer becoming pregnant for the second time(Her first pregnancy is a failure) is an example of how irritatingly predictable this movie is. The storyline may be sweet, but the corny script and the predictability made the movie excruciatingly painful to sit through. It really is a big pile of doggy doodle.",Marley & Me

I never thought a film about a dog would bring me so close to tears. I love dogs and I have never had the pleasure of owning one but Marley reminded me of my Auntie's dog whom I loved.A really simple premise but it was really thought about by the writers and the actors really gave it a lot. There were questionable moments of comedy but emotional moments of arguing, love and sadness really made the film work.The story was simple but man did it work! I felt it was a great, accurate account of a family starting at marriage, getting a dog and having kids. It would be hard and i feel Wilson and Aniston played the parts of a normal, exhausted family really well. Sure it wasn't Oscar worthy but i mean its a film about a misbehaved dog! I never thought it would be a good film. I was wrong. If you like surprises this is a good film to watch.If you don't enjoy this film i feel you have no heart. (No offence if you didn't enjoy it.)

The columnist keeps writing everyday about his daily life.. how he spent time with his wife, dogs and kids. He has a tremendous fan following. People just love reading his columns as it is something very different from the traditional news we read every day.Throughout the movie the columnist and his wife grow a special bond towards Marley. What happens to Marley and how he changes lives.. watch the movie to find out. I would quote the last line to sum it all, ""A dog has no use for fancy cars, big homes, or designer clothes. A water log stick will do just fine. A dog doesn't care if your rich or poor, clever or dull, smart or dumb. Give him your heart and he'll give you his. How many people can you say that about?

301,gear-girl,Wonderful Movie About Life and Love,9,29 January 2009,"After seeing the movie last night, I perused the comments to see how well it was received. There are several reviews that seek out the flaws in the movie, with comments about foul language, inappropriate scenes, lack of plot, lack of character development...the list goes on. I immediately recalled the following:As an engineering student in the early 90s, I took a Total Quality Management class. Six-sigma, Ishikawa diagrams, and the like were at the forefront of our analytical minds. One day our professor divided the class into several groups, and each group was given two bags of M&M plain chocolate candies. Our task was to evaluate the quality of the M&Ms. We established many criteria for evaluation of the candies and diligently began the process of seeking out each and every flaw we could find. Along with our classmates we proudly reported on instances of ""cracked candy shell"" ""missing M"" ""deformed chocolate"" and the like. Each group totaled on the board their findings, and we proudly announced to the professor that M&Ms plain candies had a quality rating of less than 20% - a whopping failure! When he told us to dispose of the candies as we see fit, we all happily and hungrily devoured the sweet treat. After he gathered the empty wrappers from our tables, he turned to the class and asked, with a grin, ""So, do you REALLY think M&Ms plain candies are such a failure after all?""Point made.I am certain that if you approach this film in the same manner that we initially approached our Quality task, you will find whatever flaws you seek. But if you find after innocently watching the movie that, for a little while, your outside distractions were removed; it reminded you of your own family's development and struggles; it brought back memories of a beloved companion animal; and yes, it had a three-hanky ending, then I find it hard to believe the movie was anything BUT brilliant.One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.",Marley & Me

The acting is excellent, Both Owen and Jennifer-who's acting I didn't really care for before (Sorry Jen) do a phenomenal job of making the movie real. The supporting cast does a great job as well. If you see nothing else this year, especially if you have ever had a dog make this the movie you go see.(I would however highly recommend reading the book FIRST!)

He's friendly and lovable, but he devours everything in sight  drywall, socks, big chunks of furniture (no, he doesn't just chew on them, he eats them). Marley may be the worst dog but he is indeed the best friend the Grogans could ever have! I strongly recommend you to watch this film.",Marley & Me

It may even not have a fantastic soundtrack.But it is definitely one of the the films of my life.All of you that has a dog, or a cat, or has a special feeling for animals, can't resist to this film. I've never cried so much on a film! It hit us right on the heart and makes us think about how is it possible that so many people mistreat the ones that most love us! Marley is an example of loyalty, gratitude... so many wonderful feelings that so many times, the human beings forget and don't give much importance!Recommend this film to everybody!",Marley & Me
306,Tim2301,Good and touching movie,8,13 March 2009,"I've seen it tonight, a very good movie, it almost made me cry on the end although. Normally i am never emotional when i watch a movie. I've seen this movie with my girlfriend and she liked it to. It's a good movie even if you even don't own a dog. This movie is in my top 10 of movies for sure. It a comedy but at the end it kind a sad somehow. This movie really make me think about getting a dog. Everybody will love this movie young or old. The theater room was for 70 percent full. I didn't heard any complains at the end at all. The main characters are well chosen and Jennifer play an excellent role. Owen Wilson show a very different side of acting in the movie, but his humor is still there",Marley & Me
307,basil4,"Yes, I did cry at the end",4,3 April 2009,"We were disappointed. We expected the movie to be about Marley. It would have been better named ""Me and her...and some about the dog"". Instead of being a Marley movie it turned out it was about changes in a young couple's life, their arguments, life events like moving and having children and the pitfalls of getting what you asked for. Marley was almost a sideline. Being dog parents ourselves, the scenes depicting how ""naughty"" Marley was were no different than anyone's experience when adopting a puppy. Far from the world's worst dog, the movie showed him as a typical, if perceptive, dog. I will read the book, hoping it is more about a dog's life. The best and most emotional part was the end. The 2nd son's calling Marley his brother was a beautiful moment.",Marley & Me
308,rbsdrone,Remembering my dog Pearlie,9,8 April 2009,"My family had a dalmatian when I was young. She died unexpectedly when she was at a kennel while we were our of town. This was when I was 8. I am now 29, and all the emotions I felt back then came up to the surface when I watched this movie. From the highs to the lows, this movie caused me to get involved in how this dog became a part of the family. The scenes at the end really made me cry. I don't know whether it was just the death or the fact that we never had the chance to do that with our dog who died in her sleep. No matter what, I had flashbacks that made me cry and smile the whole time I watched the final scenes. We buried our dog like they did, under a tree in our backyard.All I can say about this movie is that if you're a dog lover, and have dealt with a loss of a dog, you will bawl your eyes out at the end. It's worth it, though. It shows me that nobody actually gets over a loss. Just seeing something that reminds you about the person or animal lost will trigger memories, even 20 years in the future.",Marley & Me
309,kgrimard,Marley and Me,10,10 April 2009,"My lab is 12 years old and her name is Marley, how coincidental, but she is a female lab. When I first saw the book by John Grogan about 4 years ago, I was standing in front of a book shop and talking on my cell phone to my husband and it was a new book out and I saw the front cover in the window and saw the lab on the cover and I was so happy, I had to buy it. I read the book that summer and loved the book, it made me laugh, it made me remember so many things about my Marley's life as she grew up and of course it made me cry. When the movie came out this past year, I knew that I could not go and see it in the theatre because I know how much I would have cried and it's a good thing I didn't because the day the movie came out for sale, I bought it that same day and watched it at home and really enjoyed the movie, maybe not so much as the book, but I did enjoy it and laughed and really cried as well. Every day I watch my Marley deteriorate and it pains me so, but I take every day with her as a blessing because she has been through so much with me, good times, divorce, sickness, divorce again, but she's always been mine and she has always been my substance and my friend.",Marley & Me
310,ramgp,A Wonderful Family Tail,10,17 April 2009,"I just watched this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes the movie was a bit sappy but all in all this is a good solid family film or just a film to enjoy by yourself or with your friends. I liked the pairing of Aniston and Wilson, they worked well and really showed the ups and downs of a married couple well. and the actors who played the kids were wonderful too. As a dog lover this movie really appealed to me and this movie is one i'd happily again. How the canine actors were trained to be neurotic and very very overexcited is still a bit of a mystery to me. Anyhow, take your kids or take your family or take your partner or friends to watch this movie and be prepared to laugh and have a few Kleenex at the ready just in case. Enjoy the movie.",Marley & Me
311,cdagardner,"Great movie, make sure you have Kleenex handy!!",8,11 April 2009,"Wonderful little movie. Whether you're a dog lover or not, if you're part of a family or just human you should find the time to let this movie find a place in your heart. Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson are both completely believable in their roles as busy parents who change over time like everybody does. You won't go wrong with this movie, just make sure you have some tissues around for the ending which is right on pitch with how it should be when a family loses a beloved member of their clan. I wouldn't recommend the movie for anyone under 8 or so. Children younger than 8 will get distracted because the dog isn't the main storyline of the film throughout, like say Benji was. Strong flick though that I won't soon forget. 3 Stars",Marley & Me
312,tarasco,Great family movie.,7,21 April 2009,"Marley and me I saw the movie Marley and Me a few weeks ago and, I liked it. This movie is for everyone. The roles of the characters were well chosen, Marley is a very active dog, and john doesn't know anything about dogs. I got into the movie because this film brings back memories of when I had to put down my dog too. The emotions and love they showing touch my heart and drop a few tears. It shows how a dog can keeps a family together; and how an animal can teach humans to give love without receiving anything back. Marley was that one change in the Grogens mind and became very important in the Grogen family. He showed his love for everyone in the family. Other families who have teenagers should go see this movie because of the emotions and how the story is written, this movie tries to give a message that no matter how hard we try in our life we always need a companion. Marley and Grogen are a vivid example. I feel so bad that someone or something would have to die to see how much we love it. I can't think of a better scene for this movie but it could have had another ending.",Marley & Me
313,williamfjack,Contains spoiler -- Not a comedy at all,1,24 June 2009,"This movie was billed on the DVD cover as ""The Perfect Family Comedy."" My eight-year-old daughter sobbed for an hour after watching this movie. My ten-year-old daughter cried, as did my seven-year-old son. Why? A dog, who, it can be argued, is the hero of the film, dies at the end. Wow, that sure is funny.Given, there are some truly funny scenes with superb acting and a great script. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston work well together. The real ""star"" of the movie, however, is Marley. Therein lies the problem. First, kids love dogs. Secondly, kids watching this movie undoubtedly would be drawn more to the dog than to Owen Wilson or Jenniffer Aniston. Marley is the character with whom most kids would identify. Yet the script ""does him in"" at the end. Wow, I can think of no other ""family comedy"" that is centered around a pet, and that has the pet die at the end. So, warn people ahead of time. This is in no way a ""family comedy."" It's a comedy for adults, a tragedy for children.",Marley & Me

And it takes a long time to get there too.In most movies things happen for a reason, which makes them worth watching. You're taken on a journey which has an end. Along the way things happen for a reason. Specific characters and events are there to support the story.That's not the case in this movie. Things do happen though, but I just found I kept myself asking 'Why did I need to know that?'. And in the end it became clear that I didn't need to know a whole lot. Nothing actually. You can just fast forward to the end and miss nothing.The story is about a dog that finds a home at a family. A fun dog that's good at making a mess. This is good for some laughs in the beginning of the movie, but that's it. The family members just live their life. The end.(Oh yeah, Owen Wilson is still cool though, as usual.)",Marley & Me

Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston did a tremendous job with their acting.the story line of the movie was...absolutely superb. i know the movie is based on a book but it still seemed perfect. i still cannot believe how much i underestimated this film. i waited too long to watch it so i suggest that you watch the movie and experience all the joy and all the tears throughout the movie.,Marley & Me

I don't usually break my tears for movies but this one is the first exception. The movie director has beautifully said about ""MARLEY"" as he is not a pet by John's words at the end of the movie. It makes me feel that i should have a dog just as Marley.I am a student and this movie made me understand the feelings of people about their pets. This movie changed my entire felling about pets and the impact they could make on people. The last lines of the movie ' A dog has no use for fancy cars'................. till 'give them your heart and he will give u his ' is the best part of the movie. The director has dramatically given the picture of a man named John and his inner feelings related to his friend(so called dog)Marley .

I can't be helped, one year later we have had a new one again. New Tommy 2 is 2 years old yet. We love him very much. This one can stay alone at home and never barks when we are out. I suggest every parents who have children to have a dog.

Marley was a fabulous way to portray the life of a dog, from its birth to its death. oh but it was one sad death i mean: the injection! i cried so much when i saw this part:(. i felt that the actors played their roles really well.the way they spoke, walked and acted played a big part in the way this movie was made awesome. when Marley was around the children they showed the love and affection that any dog-lover would show to their dogs.i loved their house in the last few scenes it showed that after loving ion luxury they finally settled down to a nice country life",Marley & Me

But beware if you are going to be watching this with little kids. It looks like a kiddie movie by looking at the dog in the advertisement and it looks pretty tame on the trailers.I just put this one on for ""movie night"" with my 7 year old daughter and 4 year old son. The 4 year old was COMPLETELY bored by all the talking. And my 7 year old daughter was learning a bit too much about sex for my taste. I'm happy I had my remote control in hand when the 2 lead stars began to kiss passionately and throw themselves on the bed! (I'm not sure how far it actually went in the scene, but when you are expecting lighthearted dog jokes and nothing more, it really caught me by surprise!) Then when I turn the TV back on the channel and Jennifer Anniston was pregnant, the questions really started to come! I didn't think this movie would lead to my having to discuss details about where babies come from. And then there are a few more scenes like that, lots of talk about sex and a skinny dipping scene. Maybe I'm just conservative, but this is not the movie it pretends to be in the ads...",Marley & Me
321,buddywolf5,Almost Sounds Like Our Lives,8,26 December 2008,"There are always going to people who love this movie and who hate this movie. However, Anybody who's life has been touched by a dog will likely love this movie. We read the book before seeing the movie. The irony of this movie (and the same happens in life) is that even though Marley for the most part was a 100 lb ball of terror, he certainly touched peoples lives and was sorely missed at the end.There are even people in our lives that can be annoying at times, but we certainly wouldn't have it any other way. The loss of Marley certainly makes us appreciate both the pets and people in our lives.We can relate to the Grogan's about getting a mischievous but lovable dog. We got our first dog soon after we got married and since we didn't have children, we really spoiled him. Plus we got a breed that was probably a bit bigger than we could handle. We got our second dog a year later and she's more behaved. When we get our next dog, we will certainly do our homework, find the appropriate breed, and train and discipline from the start. Some people may criticize the Grogans for the lack of discipline of Marley, but hey it was their first dog and they were young. Ironically enough, if Marley wasn't such a terror, would John Grogan be where he is today?",Marley & Me

At that stage, Marley and Me hadn't been released so I called it Lassie even though it was a girl. I would now call that dog Marley.

325,Jessica_F36,I don't recommend this film.,1,29 December 2008,"I write this review not only as a dog lover but also a film student. This movie was poorly written. The film contained less than 30% of dog screen time. The film could not quite decide what it wanted to be. Cute family movie with dog or dreadfully boring film about Jennifer Aniston's and Owen Wilson's character. The first act moved along rather nicely. However once the second act starts I started to look at my watch out of boredom. The third act falls weak and it seems like the screenwriter had a hard time adapting the book near the end. First of all, I want to say Plot device or Benjamin, was lame. His character was to illustrate what could have been for John and quite frankly...it didn't work. I think the film could have been cut down about 30 minutes. It ran too long and dragged at points. I think the whole thing needed to be reworked. I hate the end. It's lame and quite honestly could have been done better. If you like dogs...don't watch this movies and if you like movies...definitely don't watch this one.",Marley & Me

It wasn't the comedy i was expecting but turned something totally different and better. Actually i cant believe that i got so emotional justby remembering the dog i had while i growing up.The scenario was based on true story from the real John Grogan so it will be everyday joys and true moments from the moment that john got the dog because he wasn't ready for a baby till he realizes that Marley was his first ""baby"".Its a definitely must see for all dog lovers and at the end i guaranty that you will remember your own dog and all the fun you had.",Marley & Me

328,mwyrick,Not a PG film!!! The ratings board and Fox should be censured.,1,3 January 2009,"Over the holidays, I took my six nieces and nephews to see this film and Adam Sandler's film BEDTIME STORIES. If you have young children you want to take to a movie, opt for the Sandler one. MARLEY & ME is not at all what the studio has advertised: it's manipulative, unbelievably crude, and not at all appropriate. I wonder who was asleep on the ratings board when they gave this film a PG rating?!?!? Cursing, sex scenes, talk about how to make a baby, a miscarriage (try explaining that one to five little girls under the age of 10!).We expected something reasonably light-hearted and funny (and though my two older nieces had read the book--I had, too--we never expected to see what we saw the last 30 minutes of this movie), not a movie that shows unnecessarily explicit scenes of pet euthanasia.Since the film was rated PG, my sisters both felt the movie would be fine for all their children. Not so. Fox Studios should be ashamed of themselves for having duped the movie-going public--the only reason this film is number one at the box office for any length of time is because of that rating. People are fooled into taking their families to see something that is not only completely inappropriate for young children in terms of morality, but graphic to the extreme in terms of pet dying and death.It's been days since my nieces and nephew saw the movie, and they are still upset and angry.",Marley & Me

Titanic, The Music Never Stopped, The Last Song, those came near, but this actually did it. The acting is just amazing, Jennifer Aniston does a great job acting as an over-stressed mother and Wilson perfectly portrays a man whose life didn't go out as planned but is still happy. The storyline is really good, I didn't want to stop watching because it really got me. It was interesting throughout the whole movie and I recommend you seeing it. Probably Top 10 of the best movies I've ever seen. If you don't cry, you don't have a soul, or you aren't mortal... As said, Excellent movie! 10/10",Marley & Me
330,rage_212,"More than ""A Man and His Dog"" film",9,3 January 2009,"After reading some of the outlandish bad reviews, I had to comment on this film. I know people's perceptions differ, but some of the bad reviews are so exaggerated and are, lack of a better word, incorrect! I was hesitant about going to see just another generic man and dog film. It was my girlfriend's idea, and I figured it would be another corny chick flick about how a couple get a dog and how it brings them together. After I began watching, it grabbed my attention and never let go! I don't think my review of this film will be able to capture the true essence and emotions this film captures, but here goes: The film was very gripping in its realistic portrayal of the development of a family and their pet from the couple's wedding until the film's end approximately 40 years into their lives. I think for most people, the couple's relationship and even a troublesome pet will seem familiar(imperfect, but yet believable). The movie isn't solely about the dog, but how the dog is a bit of a nuisance at first, but matures along with the family. Giving many more details may ruin the story, so I'll hit some of the points that need attention.Some people argue that this film lacks comedy, but it's subtle comedy(the type real life offers...nothing exaggerated and unbelievable...like too many Seth Rogan films). Owen Wilson is more toned down, but he adds his spin to a more down-to-earth role as a husband that chooses his life as a husband over the dream life he had pictured. Aniston delivers one of her best performances, in my opinion. I'm not a big fan of her acting, but she gives an undeniably good performance as Wilson's adoring wife.Regarding the ""nudity"" and ""sex"", yes they hint at having sex, but nothing is shown nor sounds like sex. There is NO NUDITY!!! There is a shot of Aniston's naked BACK(not her backside, her back). All of the film's sexual innuendos are while they are married! If anything I think this sends a positive message to younger viewers that this is the way it's supposed to be...fun isn't over after marriage and in some cases, it's when the real adventure begins. Children these days have seen worse than this film shows on network TV and MTV. I didn't hear any bad language that isn't on TV already. It wasn't what most people consider the worst words. And lastly, the sad part of the film is realistic not morbid, murder, or uncalled for...sometimes I think people are so used to films like The Dark Knight that when they see a wholesome, realistic film they're disappointed because they're wanting something epic.Give this film and chance and realize going into it that it's not the mindless, idealistic comedy that Hollywood has stuffed down our throats lately. It's heart-warming, wholesome, and true to life.",Marley & Me
