0,MartinHafer,A really good film....but what's with that awful shaky cam?!,7,10 January 2016,"Brie Larson stars as Grace. She and her boyfriend work in a residential program for teens though through the course of the film you start to realize that Grace is just as screwed up as many of these kids. Because Grace grew up being sexually abused, she has a hard time separating herself from her clients and projects many of her problems onto the kids...and sometimes behaving VERY unprofessionally. All this becomes more of a problem because Grace is pregnant--and how can a woman who never worked through her own parent/child issues possibly raise a child of her own?This is a slow but engaging film. The more you watch it, the more you're pulled into the film and Grace's world. As a guy who once worked in residential programs for teens, I can say that the filmmakers did a good job of capturing what these places are like as well as the sort of folks that work in them. 'Walking wounded' workers isn't an unusual phenomenon at all. Well worth seeing and well made, though I HATED some of the shaky cam, especially early in the film. Why is it that young filmmakers think that bad camera-work is a good thing?!?! Most audiences don't want to have motion sickness while they watch a movie!!!FYI--The film had a mistake that I noticed. Grace's father is getting out of prison and the probation department calls her to inform her. This SHOULD have been the parole department--as folks coming out of prison are never put on probation but on parole.",Short Term 12
1,SnoopyStyle,Compelling little indie with great performances,8,26 July 2014,Nate (Rami Malek) is the new counselor at a foster-care facility for troubled teens. Grace (Brie Larson) is the young woman in charge. Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) is her boyfriend. The facility is suppose to keep the young charges for 12 months at most but some stay longer. They aren't incarcerated and the counselors aren't therapists. Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) is a new kid in the facility who's been through it all before. Grace is pregnant and obviously still struggles with her past.There are some great work done by these young actors. Brie Larson is the centerpiece. Keith Stanfield has some big scenes. Kaitlyn Dever is a good young up and comer. Rami Malek brings a little bit of levity. Writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton is a new and interesting voice who brought his personal experience onto the screen. It'll be interesting to see what else he has. It'll also be interesting to see some of these actors over the next few years.,Short Term 12
2,Prismark10,Two lives of Grace,6,26 March 2017,"Short Term 12 is a story about neglected youths who live in a foster home for teenagers.Brie Larson plays Grace. She is dedicated to helping these teenage kids but her relationship with her boyfriend and co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr) lacks the care she shows to the kids and he knows it especially when Grace discovers she is pregnant.The arrival of a new girl to the facility Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) a troubled girl unravels Grace's own issues and upbringing, her father is in jail and it seems both have overlapping experiences.This is a small independent film and shows early promise from future Oscar winning actress Brie Larson. It also features Rami Malek as a new counsellor.Director Destin Cretton worked in such a care home and initially developed his experiences in a short movie which this is based on. Cretton largely keeps the movie natural, small scale and avoids histrionics.",Short Term 12
3,kosmasp,Playing out,8,15 December 2014,"Being in a home like that is not easy. It's not easy for the young inhabitants, but it's also tough for the people overseeing them. Having to carry the responsibility, not to mention having to juggle their own lives (issues, some of them concerning and influencing their behavior towards other ""crew"" members or the kids).The drama that plays out is really nicely edited together. And putting a new face to the group, who is being told what is happening at this ""new place"" (for him whom you wish there was more of in this movie). A good structure, great characters, good rap and believable, which is really important",Short Term 12
4,CinemaSerf,Low budget drama that punches well above it's weight.,6,20 July 2020,"""Grace"" (Brie Larson) is the team leader of some young carers looking after, as best they can, some young folks who have their fair share of troubles. Together with ""Mason"" (John Gallagher Jr.) with whom she is having a relationship, and Rami Malek (""Nate"") they must try to help their charges whist balancing those needs against those of themselves; a balancing act that becomes much more delicate after the arrival of ""Jayden"" (Kaitlyn Dever) and news of her pregnancy that causes ""Grace"" to face some startlingly tough prioritisation issues. At times this borders on the documentary; the style of photography - frequently intimate and frank - gives it a touching authenticity. Larson, Gallagher and Dever - as well as Frantz Turner as boss ""Jack"" who must keep both his charges and his team under some semblance of control all contribute well for much of the film. It's rather badly let down by the ending though. There is an ultimate redemption that the earlier narrative doesn't really support and as such, much of the impetus built up is pretty much snuffed out. It doesn't pull it's punches and as an observation of not just the problems of the cared for, but of the carers too, it can be a tough topic to dramatise - this tries hard, but maybe just a bit too hard?",Short Term 12
5,writers_reign,Why We Fight,9,8 November 2013,"Baz Luhrmann and Joe Wright should be locked in a Preview Theatre and made to watch this film 24/7 for one week and then drummed out of the Industry if they're not prepared to do the decent thing and slit their wrists. I agree one hundred per cent with every positive word I've read here on IMDb about this outstanding movie. Clearly in a few months' time it will be accurate to refer to it as the finest movie not to even get nominated for several Oscars, the main one, of course, being for Best Actress which Brie Larsen should win going away.It is, of course, an emotive subject and one that is time-honored - I recall an outstanding (and also Oscar-worthy) performance by Judy Garland in 'A Child Is Waiting', but just because it's been done before doesn't mean you can't do it again - should there be no more movies about alcoholism just because Billy Wilder said it all in 'The Lost Weekend'? Of course not, Wilder merely set the bar for others to aim at. The positive thing is that Short Term 12 has been booked into the Multiplex rather than the Art House circuit in England but against that I watched it with only three other people whereas an Art House screening would surely have yielded a more respectable audience. Whatever, this is a fine and important film that deserves to be seen and more than deserves any plaudits that come its way.",Short Term 12
6,grantss,"Great - an original, engaging and emotional film",8,11 March 2017,"Short Term 12 is a residential facility for troubled teenagers. The staff include Grace, Mason, Jessica and the new guy, Nate. Grace is the leader of the team and is secretly in a relationship with Mason. Things are going reasonably well until Grace discovers that she is pregnant. At about the same time, a new patient, Jaden, arrives and she stirs up unpleasant memories for Grace...Very original, engaging and emotional drama. Not the kind of setting you see covered too frequently and it is done in a very sensitive, non-judgemental manner. While initially seeming a dry subject, you get drawn in by the backstories, the interactions and the issues involved. The plot threatens to go down a predictable, safe and clichéd route from time-to-time but then constantly surprises you with its originality and focus.Great work by Brie Larson as Grace, showing early indications of the form that deservedly won her an Oscar 2-3 years later for Room. Solid work to from John Gallagher Jr (of Newsroom fame) as Mason. Cast also includes Rami Malek, who was later to star in Mr Robot, as Nate.",Short Term 12
7,george.schmidt,An indie gem and a must see(k). Larson and Gallagher give remarkable performances.,9,7 September 2013,"SHORT TERM 12 (2013) ***1/2 Brie Larson, John Gallagher, Jr., Kaitlyn Dever, Stephanie Beatriz, Rami Malek, Alex Calloway, Kevin Hernandez, Keith Stanfield, Frantz Turner. Remarkable dramedy about a foster care facility and its close and troubled relationships between faculty and residents. Larson gives an incredible performance as the lead staffer whose own personal demons threaten to unbalance her loving boyfriend/co-worker (Gallagher, equally affective and a truly natural performance) when a new arrival tween (Dever, ditto) proves to be a challenge all are not prepared for. Novice filmmaker Destin Cretton makes an indelible debut giving his actors plenty of freedom to inhabit their believable roles while the organic quality of the storyline does not hammer one over the head about the issues at hand (abused kids and long- term psychological damage often go hand in hand) yet is powerfully humane. An indie gem and a must see(k).",Short Term 12
8,evanston_dad,Troubled Kids and Troubled Adults,9,19 February 2014,"In ""Short Term 12,"" Brie Larson gives a breakout performance as Grace, a young woman who supervises a temporary housing clinic for troubled youth. One of her co-supervisors also happens to be her boyfriend, played by John Gallagher in another excellent performance. Grace, who herself is trying to recover from a troubled, abusive past, finds her emotions overwhelming her when the clinic takes in a teenage girl whose life circumstances are scarily similar to her own.The film has an authentic vibe to it that helps it avoid many of the pitfalls that would have plagued it had it been more of a Hollywood version of the same story. It does feel obligated to give us a happy, or at least hopeful, ending that doesn't exactly feel obligatory but doesn't feel completely authentic either. I don't know that in the real world kids who have been what the kids in this movie go through really ever come out of it o.k. in the end. But the performances are so good, and the film itself so assured, that it's not hard to overlook any nitpicky flaws.The film is bookended by scenes of John Gallagher's character telling stories about some of the kids who have lived at the clinic, and they are little masterpieces of naturalistic acting, perfectly capturing both the challenges and rewards inherent in devoting one's life to the kind of work the main characters devote themselves to in the movie.Grade: A",Short Term 12
9,ferguson-6,Here We Go,8,8 September 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""An indie gem"" is meant to be a term of respect for a little movie that manages to make an emotional connection, usually while being screened at a film festival or in a very limited and brief theatrical run. The best ones drive us to encourage everyone we know to take the time to see it. Such is writer/director Destin Cretton's latest.Some movies offer a promising premise and then let us down with faulty execution. Short Term 12 is actually better than its premise would lead you to expect. Credit goes to Mr. Cretton's quasi-documentary directorial style, tremendous acting from support characters played by John Gallagher Jr (Mason), Kaitlyn Dever (Jayden), and Keith Stanfield (Marcus), and a stunning lead performance from rising star Brie Larson (Grace).Grace and Mason help run a foster care facility. We witness first hand their daily work with the kids, some of it quite mundane ... though other moments incredibly powerful. Grace and Marcus have their own personal connections to this way of life, and also happen to be in a relationship that seems built on avoiding the communication and connection that goes into their daily jobs.The use of art as a communication device plays a role throughout. Marcus uses his rap lyrics, newcomer Jayden draws and writes children's stories. These two kids are particularly important because they also mirror the inner sanctum of Mason and Grace, and we see these people all battle demons in hope of living a ""normal"" life. This is not a story of saints and sinners ... these are just people coming to grip with the deck they've been dealt.You will recognize Gallagher from his work on HBO's ""Newsroom"", and Dever made quite an impression in her time on ""Justified"". Larson's star is on the rise thanks to her presence in The Spectacular Now and Don Jon, as well as some upcoming projects. She IS what critics have been trying make Greta Gerwig ... an actress who breathes life into character we feel we know.",Short Term 12
10,morrison-dylan-fan,Term 12.,10,7 July 2016,"Taking a look at movies that are about to be taken off Netflix UK,I spotted a title starring Brie Larson.Since having only previously seen Larson be cute in the fun 21 Jump Street,I decided to go for a short term.The plot:Along with her boyfriend Mason,Grace works in a shelter for troubled teenagers,where they can each stay for up to 18 years,and get help to try and assist them with their psychical and psychological issues. Getting close to leaving the shelter,Mason and Grace find Marcus struggling with the prospect of entering the outside world again.Spotting her being completely quiet,Grace tries to bond with new resident Jayden.As Jayden begins to open up about the events which cause her to self-harm,Grace begins to open up for the first time about the similar events which took place in her childhood.View on the film:Expanding on his short movie and the work he did at a shelter for teenagers,the screenplay by writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton gives everyone at the shelter a fully fleshed out depth,where the actions of just one resident (such as running off) affect the entire group in the shelter.Displaying extraordinary sensitivity to the abuse that the teens have faced,Cretton delicately explores the abuses that Jayden,Marcus and Grace have faced by treating them as beautiful (but troubled) individuals,which shines as Marcus starts to rap,Jayden beats up a balloon animal,and Grace allows her guard to be dropped for Mason.Keeping Joel P. West's great score humming in the background,director Cretton & cinematographer Brett Pawlak give the film an incredibly raw atmosphere that picks up all of the painful scars covers the residences and the staff. Filming parts of the title in a hand-held manner,Cretton avoids the infamous ""shaky cam"" by smartly using the hand held method for tightly coiled close-ups which pours into the heart wrenching emotions that the staff and residence are revealing.Lying that she had worked with disadvantaged children in order to get the part, (she did apply to work as a volunteer in shelters for teens,but was turned down by each one) Brie Larson gives a passionate, incredibly realistic performance as Grace. Giving Grace a warm smile,Larson takes a caring, gestalt approach to Grace,by Larson gradually bringing down Grace's self-made, defensive barriers,to unveil the ""whole"" Grace. Largely cast from ""open casting"" calls,the residences of the shelter each giving mesmerising performances,with Keith Stanfield's earthy raps of Marcus and Kaitlyn Dever's astonishingly quiet,understanding outpouring of emotion from Jayden being just two of the incredible highlights from the 12th short term.",Short Term 12
11,lasttimeisaw,Cretton has done a remarkable job and emerged as one of the few new talents worthy of our attention,8,27 October 2015,"Actress Brie Larson is red-hot for her new film ROOM (2015), directed by Lenny Abrahamson (FRANK 2014), an Oscar hopeful this season, which seems to guarantee her first Oscar- nomination after the snub of her breakthrough performance in this indie feature, 2 years ago.SHORT TERM 12 is director/writer Cretton's feature debut and is inspired by his own experiences as a staff member at a group facility, which had been made as a short with the same title in 2008. This feature length stars Larson as Grace, a young supervisor working in a home for troubled teenagers, and it opens with the first day for a newbie worker Nate (Malek), who is a wide-eyed surrogate for viewers who is unfamiliar with their vocation, is given a pep talk by the old-hand Mason (Gallagher Jr.) and later joined by Grace. Although the excremental anecdote is off-putting (why Americans are so obsessed with toilet jokes?), it certainly generates an air of blitheness will contradict what is happening during their work, and Grace is the centre pillar of the narrative, and Cretton slowly but steadily discloses her own trouble past: through her firm determination to arrange an abortion after getting pregnant (also it is not her first time); the weird physical intimacy between her and Mason, who turns out to be her long- time boyfriend; how she decides to tell him about their baby after observing that he might be capable of being a good father and accepts the subsequent marriage proposal then rescinds it. The storyline of Grace's personal turmoil intersects superbly with her work, her bonding with those teens, particularly with Jayden (Dever), a girl experiences a similar situation of hers, it is to her she can finally divulge her abused past which she find very difficult to communicate with Mason, sometimes we can only blow the lid off with our own kind, at least in the first step.Larson is a formidable and dauntless actress, reflects an aura of maturity well beyond her age (she was only 23 when the film was made), no wonder critics likens her as a more low-key version of Jennifer Lawrence, equally feisty in exploring maturer roles and excels. In this movie, she excellently pulls off the somewhat over-cooked ""I have a secret but it is too traumatic to tell you"" manoeuvre, and outshines everyone else in it. Dever, a starlet with potentiality, outstandingly nails the scene where she tells the heartrending octopus allegory, and so is Keith Stanfield as Marcus (the only actor recruited from the original short), whose rap solo is such a powerful pathos-inviter. By comparison, Gallagher Jr.'s golden-hearted Mason, has a less showier part as the loyal and undefeated boyfriend, who has been rescued by his Spanish- speaking foster family and turns out to be an upright young man, a typical supporting default, but he brings about enough tenderness and compassion to be sincerely memorable.Cretton effortlessly wields the hand-held technique to create super-personal close-ups upon his characters, teases out a full gamut of emotions since most of the characters are victims of the dark-side of humanity, while remains a fitting gradation of detachment without being too aggressive or exploitive, especially the ending, resonates the opening and lands an apposite coda with a rosy message of hope and laughters. Overall, Cretton has done a remarkable job and emerged as one of the few new talents worthy of our attention for their next project, plus the film fairly earns a spot on my top 10 list of the year.",Short Term 12
12,Hellmant,Like all great drama it manages to find the light in the darkness!,9,15 January 2014,"'SHORT TERM 12': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Critically acclaimed indie drama film about a foster-care facility for troubled youths and the people who run it. It was written and directed by Destin Cretton and is adapted from his own 2008 short film of the same name. It stars Brie Larson, John Gallagher Jr., Kaitlyn Dever, Rami Malek and Keith Stanfield. The movie is absolutely heartbreaking and depressing at times but ultimately uplifting. A very impressive accomplishment for Cretton as well as Larson in the lead.The film centers on Grace (Larson), a counselor in her twenties who has a troubled past of her own. She works at a foster-care for 'at-risk teenagers' and is in a romantic relationship with another counselor there named Mason (Gallagher, Jr.). She also just learned that she's pregnant. This combined with the drama of the kids, she's working with, is becoming too much for her. One kid, Marcus (Stanfield), is about to turn 18 and be released from the facility. He's having a lot of trouble with this. Grace also bonds with a new teen she's now in charge of named Jayden (Dever). Jayden and Grace have experienced similar trauma, involving people they trusted, that brings them closer together.The movie seems really realistic and true to life and brings together a lot of different types of people with similar problems. It's very touching and at times almost too depressing but like all great drama it manages to find the light in the darkness (which is what truly makes films like this special). Larson is very pretty and talented but I've only seen her in supporting roles before this (like 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD', 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW' and 'DON JON'). She really does an outstanding job in the lead here; her character is very relatable and admirably strong (despite her past abuse). Cretton did a very good job of coming up with such a believable screenplay and bringing all these characters to life (the supporting cast is all more than decent as well). It's definitely a very memorable and moving film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAydMPYt0Hs",Short Term 12
13,g-bodyl,"Where is the Love, Academy?",10,25 November 2014,"Short Term 12 is one of those overlooked films that if you blink, it will be gone by the time you open your eyes. Being released in the last week of August doesn't help matters. Anyhow, this small indie is utterly fantastic and is the best film of 2013. The realism plays a huge factor and so does the excellent screenplay, acting, and directing. Maybe this film will open eyes to those who have little knowledge about abused children in who are sent to group homes. This film is about character and emotion, good and painful emotions.This film is about life through the eyes of Grace, a twenty-something counselor at a group home who suffered from the same thing the children she takes care of does. She has a long-term relationship with a co-worker named Mason. But when one troubled girl named Jayden shows up, her life immediately begins to unravel.The acting is fantastic, especially Brie Larson. She should have been nominated for Best Actress. She adds soul to her character and the film does a good job in showing her character's dark past piece by piece. The film does feature other fine performances, namely John Gallagher Jr. as Mason, but no one comes close to Brie's fierce performance.Overall, Short Term 12 is an excellent film and a criminally underseen movie. This film is so realistic, one could almost view the movie as a documentary. But alas, this is the most powerful film of the year and that happens out of conversations and minimalistic action, which is a near impossible feat. Too bad this film was ignored by the Academy, because it deserved a boatload of nominations. I rate this film 10/10.",Short Term 12
14,lesleyharris30,"Superb Performances, Underwhelming Character Development,",7,25 September 2016,"Short Term 12 is a good movie with a well written plot and a stellar cast. The performances are without a doubt the highlight, everyone gives it their all. Every piece of dialogue is delivered with pure realism, there is no sense of acting, the best scenes are without a doubt those between Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr., there chemistry was superb. Neither of them was afraid to unleash themselves to the other. I was, however, disappointed by the ending, as it ends without us getting much of a sense of where these characters are headed, there is not much progression to their lives. It is practically the exact same as it is in the beginning. It starts the same way as it ends, which some people probably loved, but I felt it contradicted everything that occurred prior. As well as that, Grace never seems challenged, she seems perfectly capable of handling every problem that comes her way. There is no moment where the character is really struggling and loses her strong demeanor, never a moment where she loses all hope, which should occur to every movies protagonist in order to gain the viewers support. I felt the intimacy of the film was what made it unique, taking place almost entirely within the facility, which was certainly a clever way to make us form a bond with these characters. Sweet, dramatic and well acted, Short Term 12 has its flaws but makes up for it with what it does right, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. Grace works in a shelter for young people where she finds herself struggling to juggle her work and love life. Best Performance: Brie Larson",Short Term 12
15,Reno-Rangan,A turning point for many in their career,9,25 January 2014,"This movie came with a surprise, keeping everything so simple. The director's first full length feature which is actually based on his short movie of the same name. This movie tells the story of a group of young foster-care home supervisors and teenagers who live under their observation.A realistic movie with well balanced between characters and its narration. It was very much original subject and also in a believable manner. The movie with not-so-popular actors had achieved something every beginner filmmaker wanted to prove their direction skills. From screenplay to performances, it was outstanding.It all begins with a character Grace, a staff at a foster house facility and her co-worker as well her boyfriend, Mason. When a new staff joins them, soon, an another new kid called Jayden brought into the house under the supervision. After some incident Grace and Jayden begin to merge in emotionally for having a similar kinda previous events. Grace gets disturbed and her life begins to trouble the present. With all this, how she gonna face the current situation is the movie to be told in the remains.It had a very good opening sequence. Later on it went little slow but I liked as it was described in such pace to bring quality in drama. The second half is what everyone is going to love the movie for carrying striking storyline. The sustainable pace and story with expansion in broad was the highlight of the last quarter of the movie narration.As I expected it was not a commercial product, but definitely it will be recognizable in film festival arenas. It is not your usual movie that you had seen in Hollywood. Honestly, one of the 2013's best movie drama. 'Short Term 12' is the movie will be a turning point for many in their career, especially for the actress and the director.",Short Term 12
16,zkonedog,What An Emotional Punch,9,2 March 2017,"Every once in awhile, a film comes completely out of nowhere and utterly surprises me. This was exactly the case with ""Short Term 12"". It took a family member to recommended it to me...and even he only knew of it via film school! I'm glad I checked it out, though, as it held me in tow for the duration.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on a ""holding tank"" for young people who are awaiting court judgments. In other words, the next step before either juvenile detention or foster care. Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) are the most experienced staff leaders, and they also happen to be in a relationship with each other. As the viewer learns more about the facility, residents such as Marcus (Keith Stanfield), Luis (Kevin Hernandez), Sammy (Alex Calloway), and Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) are introduced, including an insider look at why each of them are at the facility.This is a movie about people and issues...plain and simple. Right from the opening scene, director Destin Daniel Cretton knows how to seamlessly begin weaving a complex drama, one which only strengthens as the characters are introduced. Basically, the strength of the film is that each character feels so ""real"". Nothing seems overly dramatic or ""made up"". Facilities like this exist, people like this exist, and ""Short Term 12"" tries its best to show the reality of the situation through a number of different possible scenarios.This movie is also quite a small production. It doesn't need a big-name director, crazy CGI, or a star-studded cast to succeed. It just relies on the ""old school"" qualities of a solid script, great acting from everyone, and a diverse range of characters that will give ""something to everyone"".Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give ""Short Term 12""? I'm not just ""being nice"" to it because it is an independent film. It is more just the opposite...I'm marveling at how such a low- key movie can rank right up there among my favorites. Kind of a sad statement to make regarding the movie-producing business, which is so caught up right now in sequels and ""get 'em in the theater"" flicks. ""Short Term 12"" proves, however, that nothing over-the-top is needed to make a great film.",Short Term 12
17,Floated2,Realistic feeling and emotionally moving,8,17 January 2021,"Having heard about the constant praise of this film over the years from both fans and critics but not knowing exactly what it was about. The story and in which it is acted and filmed, somewhat of a documentary style made it seem very realistic, emotionally moving and overall intriguing to watch from the beginning. Can see as to why this film is as beloved. Even with a relatively low budget, the writing, acting and story do excel and leave a lasting impression once finished watching.It has that sort of ""coming to age"" story which people love but also features some needed comedic relief at points. And of course with all the sad drama which occurs throughout, a happy ending was expected.",Short Term 12
18,eddie_baggins,A star making film for Cretton and actress Brie Larson,8,13 May 2014,"Sometimes a movie that on the surface may seem small in both scale and scope has much more to say than anyone gave it credit for until they themselves have seen it. Destin Cretton's feature debut Short Term 12 is one of those films whose synopsis does not give it credit for what it broaches in its short 90 minute running time.Coming out of nowhere and striking a chord with audiences the world over Short Term 12 is a fantastically written and observant film that has a lot to say about both disconnected youth and those whose lives have been affected by sometimes unspeakable trauma. Cretton has a deft touch both in his screen writing and in his gritty hand-held filming approach and the two mould together to paint an emotionally driven portrait of those in the ""limbo"" house between broken home and new foster accommodation. There are some striking scenes in the film namely a heartbreaking rap from Marcus (Stanfield) a boy who has clearly experienced much heartbreak or two bookend scenes played out with dialogue chronicling adventures of the homes residents. These moments in the film showcase Cretton as a talent to watch just like the films leading lady Brie Larson.Small films like Short Term 12 have been a breeding ground for break out performances for years now, with those looking to break into a tough industry choosing tough roles to show off their wares. Brie Larson here in her role as conflicted and inwardly troubled worker Grace stamps herself as an actress capable of both pure heartrending emotion and an equal talent at comedic timing and lovable charm, no doubt a few tricks were learned from her time in praised TV show The United States of Tara and supporting roles in films such as 21 Jump Street and Don Jon. It's a pleasure to see an actress grow before your eyes as Larson does and she is ably supported by an impressive adult cast and a cast of young adults that are led by Justified's impressive young actress Kaitlyn Dever.Short Term 12 is as stated a small film that deals with big issues and deals with them in a way that is both confronting yet in a manner that seems just right. It's a film brimming with heart and personality and a film that could stand equal to many more high profile films of last year. I personally can't wait to see where both Larson and Cretton go to next.4 hated inflatable dogs out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Short Term 12
19,Red-125,Powerful movie about a group home,9,16 December 2020,"Short Term 12 (2013) was written and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton.
Short Term 12 is the name of a group home. It's where kids go ""until the county figures out what to do with them.""The director of Short Term 12 is Grace, portrayed well by Brie Larson. She's good at what she does, and she realizes that, given the situation, there will always be crises at the home.John Gallagher Jr. plays Mason, a seasoned staffer at the home, and Grace's partner. LaKeith Stanfield is Marcus, who will be 18 in a week, and will be leaving the home. Kaitlyn Dever plays Jayden Cole, the newest admission to the group home.A movie about a group home is going to be an ensemble film, with each of the residents having her or his role to play. However, the plot really centers around Grace, and her relationship with Mason and with Kendra. We see some great acting in the way Grace deals with her problems and with their problems. (It's not a triangle--it's Grace interacting with two important people in her life.)This is a powerful movie, and it has the ring of authenticity about it. I like that fact that it's called Short Term 12. There's probably a Short Term 11 and a Short Term 13. There's nothing special about Short Term 12, except that we know that all the residents and staff people have stories of their own. We get to see some of the stories of some of the people. If we went to Short Term 11, we'd see different stories. Director Cretton has taken us to Short Term 12, and has made these stories into an outstanding movie.Because most of the movie is set within the group home, the film works well on the small screen. The movie has an very high IMDb rating of 8.0. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9.",Short Term 12
20,howard.schumann,May just be the best film of the year,10,24 November 2013,"Real heroes do not always end up with glory and parades. Heroism is sometimes reflected in small scale actions that no one ever hears about but occur every day in schools, hospitals, or wherever there are people who need compassion. Werner Erhard defines true heroism as ""the kind which ends up in the truth, in what works, in what is honest and real being brought out and made available to others."" This kind of authenticity is front and center in Destin Cretton's Short Term 12, the story of troubled teens living in a short-term group home who are the recipients of empathy from counselors only a few years older who may have faced similar situations in their life.Winner of the audience award at the L.A. Film Festival and South by Southwest as well as the narrative feature prize, it is funny and sad with a wide range of emotions in-between. Coming from the director's own experience of working in a similar environment for two years, the film is permeated with an air of authenticity and it is rare that a film has such uniformly natural performances. Grace (Brie Larson) is the staff supervisor at the home known only as Short Term 12, a designation reflecting the fact that the residents are supposed to be there for no more than a year, although many have been there longer. The longer they stay, however, the more traumatic it is for them to leave.These are not ""bad"" kids though some may have had run-ins with the law. They are, more often than not, victims of parental abuse or neglect whose continuing to live at home would put them at risk. Most of the children are scared and have a lot of hidden anger but Cretton does not present them in a way that solicits our pity. They are who they are and we relate to them as fellow human beings. As Grace tells Nate (Rami Maledk), a new worker at the home, ""We're not their parents or their therapists. We're just here to create a safe environment."" These words seem to be lost on Nate, however, who, when introduced to the residents, says ""I've always wanted to work with underprivileged kids,"" an insulting designation to which 17-year-old Marcus (Keith Stanfield) takes umbrage. Marcus, who is going to be discharged when he reaches 18, ready or not, elicits a stumbling apology from Nate who realizes his mistake.Grace's boyfriend, Mason (John Gallagher), begins the film with a story about an embarrassing incident with a young runaway. The story, which is gross and off-putting, is interrupted by bells going off as a scrawny young boy, Sammy (Alex Calloway), a frequent runaway, makes a beeline for the gate but is intercepted before he can make it outside the property. Jayden, in an impeccable performance by Kaitlyn Dever, is a new arrival who has made previous suicide attempts. Expecting her father to take her home soon, she is surly and uncommunicative and is only able to communicate with Grace by means of a heartbreaking children's story she wrote about a shark and an octopus, a story with a hidden meaning that that Grace pick ups on.Marcus, in another moving scene, sings a deeply felt rap song he created for Mason about ""a life not knowing what a normal life's like."" Although the children play a huge role in the film, the main focus is on Grace and how her work affects her life. We find out at the beginning that she is pregnant and has scheduled an appointment to have an abortion, but she is conflicted. She knows that Mason loves her and would be a good father but she has seen neglectful parents or worse in her own life and at the home and her built-up anger expresses itself in a memorable scene.Short Term 12 could have become another film that sets out to inspire us through contrivance and manipulation. Under Cretton's direction, however, if there are tears to be shed, every one of them is earned. Though it (most likely) will not be remembered when awards are handed out at the end of the year, unlike many films with huge budgets and greater hype, it will remain with you after the others are long forgotten. Short Term 12 may just be the best film of the year.",Short Term 12
21,TheMovieDiorama,Short Term 12 cares for its viewers by making them feel every emotion possible.,10,2 May 2019,"There's nothing more special and valuable in life than raising a child. It's thought to be one of the most rewarding experiences available. To see parents ignore, disown and even abuse their own flesh and blood, well, it doesn't make for an easy watch. In fact it might just be the worst. But Short Term 12 painted these teenagers in what I can only describe as the most appropriate watercolours possible. Bright vivid characters blending their sorrow and optimism together to produce beautiful personalities. We follow a group of carers, in particular a troubled young adult named Grace, in their daily lives of facilitating a healthy and safe environment for youths that are in need of care.This is one of those films that I've been avoiding for a few months now. Initially, I felt I had to mentally prepare myself. With many claiming they instantly bursted into tears, I was not ready for that. Having now watched these glistening characters for ninety minutes, only one word was on my mind after the credits rolled. Perfection. It is extremely rare, a near impossible achievement, to find a lucrative drama that exhumes every emotional stance available. Short Term 12 did. Not only that, but it made me substantially appreciate the work and effort that child carers put in every single day. An incredible and somewhat heroic job that Cretton intimately crafts through his delicate screenplay. He illustrates the very best of humanity within these characters, from the joyous opportunities that life has to offer to various days of darkened solitude.It would be an understatement to claim that this is so far away from exhibiting Hollywood clichés, with absolutely no exposition and unnecessary quirky narrations. No. This is real life. Cretton gracefully opens a window, allowing us to peer into the struggles and opportunities these children and carers uphold. Frighteningly realistic. Every second builds upon the harshness of reality, gradually laying the foundations of each teenager's backstory. Abuse leads to self-harming. Ignorance leads to depression. Cretton does not avoid these scenarios, rather he tackles them head on. Further illustrating the importance of parenthood and how children rely on that unconditional love.Grace, who experienced a troubled past herself, symbolises the ever-lasting hurt one can receive from atrocious parenting. It never dissipates. All she can do is attempt to move on, distract herself by assisting others who unfortunately succumbed to the same harrowing treatment. Heartbreaking.Larson, in what was her first leading role, was incredible. One of the finest performances I have ever witnessed for such an emotionally complicated character. Whether it be an outburst of pure anger, tears of mental melancholy or smiles of genuine happiness. Larson transformed into her role without any physical alterations. This performance alone has changed my mind about her as an actress. Actually, every cast member was exceptional. Gallagher Jr. balances the smartly executed light comedic moments with a dosage of relationship woes, supporting Larson's performance magnificently. Even the teenagers, particularly a young Stanfield and Devers, captured the fragility and delicate nature of their troubled personalities. A tangible environment that hinges on an intricately sustainable aura that, if altered in some way, could turn the very best day into the absolute worst.Cretton's direction reflects an indie touch to each camera movement, with two tear-inducing scenes highlighting his powerful talent. Stanfield's one take rap, lyrically illustrating his anguish and hurt in being disowned, not only made me shed a tear but it was confidently executed by ensuring the camera never looks away from his face, in particular his eyes. The second is Devers' story about an octopus giving up her arms for a ""friendly"" shark. This time Cretton switches the camera between the three angles. The illustrations in her story, Devers' innocent storytelling and Larson's shocked face. A perfect culmination in building emotional depth from just one scene. Masterful. Oh, and I cried. Full on waterworks.I've had the night to reflect upon this dramatic endeavour, and the more I think about it, the harder it is to criticise. Therefore I came to the abrupt conclusion that for me, this film is faultless. It is an incredible work of art that immediately draws you in with its personable characters, human qualities and harrowing themes. So, without further ado, let's get the inevitable final sentence out of the way. I've been low-key excited to say this...! Short Term 12 obtains that elusive perfect rating.",Short Term 12
22,l_rawjalaurence,Something of a Missed Opportunity,5,11 July 2014,"Much-lauded on its original release by critics and viewers alike, SHORT TERM 12 is a powerful drama set in a foster home, where twentysomething carer Grace (Brie Larson), and her fellow-workers Mason (John Gallagher Jr) and Nate (Rami Melek) spend their lives looking after disturbed or abused teenagers, including Marcus (Keith Stanfield), Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), and Sammy (Alex Calloway). Their job certainly isn't easy: many of these teenagers have had difficult lives, and find it very difficult to talk about their experiences. Sometimes Grace gets into conflict with her superior Jack (Frantz Turner), in the belief that not enough attention has been paid by the so-called professionals towards the teenagers' plight. However Grace herself is not without problems: we learn that she has had a disturbed childhood - so disturbed, in fact, that she cannot even talk about it to Mason. The prospect of her father being released on probation from prison fills her with horror. Destin Daniel Cretton's production contains some powerful performances, notable from Larson and Dever, whose characters develop a bond with one another, despite their difficulties. However the script is marred by some obvious implausibilities: if Grace has had such a disturbed past, one wonders why she has been put in a position of such responsibility at the foster home. In one sequence she is shown entering Jayden's house, while Jayden is at home, using the front door key concealed under the doormat. One wonders why the key is kept there when the family are at home. Jayden and Grace smash up Jayden's father's car with a baseball bat, but no one - not even the police - visits the foster home to investigate what has happened. There is a happy ending, but it seems rather contrived, as the director wanted above all to show that these kids - Grace included - could be redeemed, so long as people made the effort to understand them. SHORT TERM 12 represents something of a missed opportunity, despite its subject-matter.",Short Term 12
23,Turfseer,"Occasionally harrowing, but also sentimental look at foster care treatment facility, lacks an identifiable antagonist",5,19 August 2013,"Destin Cretton's script about a foster care treatment facility was a 2010 Nichol Fellowship winner. It's an earnest, feel-good effort which mainly focuses on its protagonist, Grace (Brie Larson), a 20 something counselor at the facility. She's in charge of a group of dysfunctional teenagers, who exhibit varying degrees of self-destructive behavior.Grace herself is a victim of domestic abuse at the hands of her father, who we soon learn will be released from a correctional facility after serving time due to Grace's testimony against him. Grace is involved in a relationship with another co-worker counselor, Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), who was raised by warm, loving foster parents, in contrast to Grace's damaged upbringing. Part of the plot involves Grace's internal arc, as she struggles whether to have an abortion, following an unexpected pregnancy. You can probably guess what she ultimately decides to do about having the baby.The bulk of 'Short Term 12' concerns Grace and Mason's struggle to help the kids in their charge. The staff eschews a punitive approach when dealing with the kids and are also bound by state laws that prohibit them from bringing them back to the facility, if they leave the grounds. Hence, there are a number of dramatic scenes where the counselors engage in mad dashes to try and prevent one particularly dysfunctional kid from exiting the perimeter.Probably the greatest strength of the film is the depiction of the meltdown of two particularly distressed teenagers: Marcus, an aspiring rap artist and Jayden, a teenage girl, who Grace suspects is being physically and sexually abused by her father. There are dark moments for both of the teenagers: Marcus attempts suicide and Jayden is taken home by her father on a weekend pass, where presumably she's being abused. Naturally, there is the obligatory happy-ending for both of them: Marcus eventually gets himself together and hooks up with a former beauty who attended the facility (this story happens off-screen and is related to us by Mason at film's end); and Jayden is saved after Grace convinces her to testify to social service agency officials about the abuse, at the hands of her father.'Short Term 12' suffers most from the lack of an identifiable antagonist. We never do get to meet either Grace of Jayden's father, who are depicted as uncaring monsters. By fleshing either one of them out (or both), and linking them organically to the plot, Mr. Cretton's narrative, could have been way more dramatic and exciting. Instead, Cretton loses sight of creating more complex characters by getting too emotionally involved in his subject matter. Probably the weakest scene is when Grace links her own crisis of the impending release of her father from prison to Jayden's, breaking into her father's home, and almost ending up bashing him over the head with a baseball bat. Instead, Grace and Jayden take turns bashing in the window of the deep asleep father's car. Yes, we understand that Cretton doesn't like abusers, but he never introduces any of them to us as real human beings.Finally, it's nice to know that the caring efforts of Grace and Mason pay off in the end, but how realistic is that? Often what happens is that dysfunctional kids, those who have been oppressed by abusive parents, become abusers themselves. Hence, the old dictum of the oppressed becoming the oppressors, seems to be missing here. How about a kid who Grace and Mason can't save, and is just plain evil? It's another opportunity missed to introduce a credible antagonist.As a first feature effort, Destin Cretton has created a fairly credible look at what goes on in some foster care treatment facilities today. With a little more seasoning, Mr. Cretton may break into the film business, as a full-time director. He certainly knows how to direct his actors and work with a cinematographer. Cretton needs to be a little less sentimental and work at developing a full-fledged antagonist, when he develops his sophomore effort.",Short Term 12

26,drqshadow-reviews,"A Vivid Peek into the Dark, Quiet Corners of Damaged Youth",9,7 July 2016,"A raw and heady drama that doesn't lose touch with its humanity or delve so far into the somber material that it feels like a drag. In a performance that catapulted her to greater visibility, Brie Larson plays Grace, supervisor-cum-therapist to a small houseful of troubled youths. Grace seems to know the right approach to penetrating even the sturdiest veneer, but that understanding stems from similar incidents in her own past that she's never truly addressed. It can often seem easier to show others the way than to do the same for yourself, I suppose. Surrounding Larsen is an excellent set of supporting efforts, helmed by John Gallagher Jr. as her big-hearted secret boyfriend/coworker, but the real show-stealers are the kids themselves. Each touched with a turgid, tragic set of challenges all their own, they succeed at portraying mistrust, resentment, anger, helplessness... and, strikingly, an innate sense of community. Their complexities are the keys to this story, gateway to a dark world that many of us would never dare to explore on our own. Efficient, emotional, intense but not oppressive - tension-breakers arrive in all the right moments - this was a wonderful surprise, and something that's bound to stick with me for some time.",Short Term 12

This is only my second five star review from 2013 and this small indie absolutely hit all the right notes with me taking me through a wide range of emotions thanks to its perfect balanced mix of comedy and touching drama. I was drawn to these characters from the very opening scene and was completely engaged with the story. Having visited a foster care facility a couple times last year and spent some time with kids going through similar situations, this film really hit home and helped me empathize more with them. In a way I kind of felt like Nate, the new counselor in this film who didn't connect right away with the kids and there was not much he could do to help considering he had no idea where they were coming from. On the other hand, the two other counselors, Grace and Mason, really connected with the children because they came from similar backgrounds and understood how they were feeling. Short Term 12 writer and director, Destin Cretton, uses this film as a vehicle to let the viewer have a better understanding of the social situation these kids go through. I don't know if this would've worked so well if it weren't for the incredibly touching performances from the cast. Brie Larson is so great in this film, she hit all the right notes, and in some way she reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. She has that same potential and her career will definitely take off after this. She deserves an Oscar nomination because she's that good. Her co-lead, John Gallagher Jr. also delivers a terrific performance and if we haven't heard much about him it's because Larson steals most of the thunder here. Even the kids in this film were terrific and that's why I'm giving this film the highest possible grade because it does everything right.Grace (Brie Larson) is one of the young counselors at Short Term 12, a foster care facility for at risk teenagers. Along with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), with whom she's in a relationship, they look after these kids who have come from a troubled past. The film opens with Mason welcoming a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek), and he shares a story with him about his first day which didn't go too great. Then they introduce some of the kids to him: there's Marcus (Keith Stanfield) who's about to turn 18 and therefor will be leaving the facility soon, Sammy (Alex Calloway) who's going through a deep psychological trauma, and Luis (Kevin Hernandez) who's easygoing but enjoys bullying Marcus. A few days later a new teenage girl named Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the foster care center who seems to be deeply scarred. Grace begins to connect with her and realizes they have come from a similar past. Grace and Mason are both excellent counselors, mostly because they have come from a troubled past themselves, and despite helping these kids they also have to deal with their own scars in life if they want their relationship to work. I loved the way that Cretton decided to open the film with Mason telling Nate a story, and then deciding to end it with another one. The structure of this film was just perfectly executed and I loved the balance it maintained. There were several different plots going on as each kid was going through different problems. The final scene in this film literally gave me goose bumps all over my body. Many people had an issue with it ending with such a positive note, but I thought it was perfect. Larson is a major reason why this film worked so well, her character Grace is just that: a graceful person who is doing her best to help these kids while at the same time trying to deal with her own demons. Dever and Stanfield also deliver powerful secondary performances and each one of them shares a memorable scene with one of their counselors as they try to express their feelings through different ways: Marcus does so by rapping and Jayden by reading a story. These two scenes are extremely powerful and emotional and they stand out in the film without feeling forceful or manipulative at all. This film just has so much heart and it's no surprise it has such a high rating (99% on Rottentomatoes) because it really is a vivid portrait that draws us in to these characters troubled lives in the pursuit and need of healing. Brie Larson's Grace has just become my favorite heroine of the year. That octopus story will stick with me forever, there was a lot of powerful stuff in this film.",Short Term 12
28,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Heart wrenching. An important film.,10,25 February 2016,"Short Term 12 is a film focusing on heavy, dark themes which would threaten to mire us in inescapable gloom, if it weren't for the levity and comforting emotional truth which permeates its themes. The people in this film act, react and interact like real human beings and not pawns in a rigidly preordained script, giving the subject matter much more weight. Brie Larson shows immense early promise before her shattering work in 2015's Room here as Grace, a member of a residential treatment facility for orphaned and troubled teenagers. Every day she is faced with various youngsters who are troubled in different ways, and initially she appears to us as a girl who is capable and stable in her work, using intuition and compassion to help. But as the plot moves on, we begin to see that she comes from a harrowing background not unlike the kids she is working with. When withdrawn, cynical Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever, who made quite an impression on Justified and nails a difficult, vulnerable role heartbreakingly here) comes into the picture, Grace is jarringly reminded of her own past and starts to unravel. Her relationship with fellow worker Mason (a wonderfully naturalistic John Gallagher Jr.) suffers confusion and trauma at a critical stage, her work with the youths adding further stress to her already haunted state of mind. The film explores how people's past experiences, particularly the traumatizing ones, can help, hinder and simply be relatable to one another further on in life, reminding a seemingly confident individual of something they may need to reconcile with, even if they don't consciously know it. It's tough to tread around subjects like sexual abuse and avoid both sensationalism and exploitation. This one does both admirably and without any showboating. It simply shows human beings who have suffered unfathomable mistreatment, connecting on a painful level that crystallizes into healing. Larson and Dever beautifully illustrate this with their brave, compelling work, as does an excellent supporting cast. Incredibly important and essential viewing.",Short Term 12

After all, we have Brie Larson who has really just grown into a great and diverse actress; Rami Malek who I wish was in more things since I have been following his career since The War at Home was on air; and then we have, from Brooklyn Nine-Nine, albeit not in a big speaking role, Stephanie Beatriz. Characters & StoryThe title of the movie Short Term 12 is about this place which seemingly is supposed to act as a temporary foster facility. At said facility are the line workers Grace (played by Brie Larson), Mason (played by John Gallagher, Jr.), Jessica (played by Stephanie Beatriz), and Nate (played by Rami Malek). Together, they help monitor at least a dozen kids who are in this home for various reasons. The two main kids they focus on though are Marcus (played by Keith Stanfield) and Jayden (played by Kaitlyn Dever).Now, it should be noted that in the story they don't go easy on the teen/ child actors at all and they very much deal with what is considered ""adult emotions/ situations."" There is a lot of talk of abuse, a showing of scars and bruises, and the story, especially for Grace, deals with the trauma which is dealt with even decades after the abuse ends. But, at the same time, there is a strong showing of how loved ones, even those not blood related, can make a bad situation better, or at least be there to keep them from getting worse.PraiseIn general, I try to keep these reviews under a 1000 words, but to really properly praise this film I might need more than that. So, let me try to summarize the best I can. Starting off with Brie Larson, I think most of the praise and admiration Jennifer Lawrence is getting right now, should definitely be shared with Brie Larson. Taking nothing away from Lawrence, Larson quickly brings you into Grace's life and keeps you in awe. In awe that despite it all, she can smile; despite it all she can love; and though I have no idea what Larson may have been through in her life, her taking on this role gave me the type of empathy in which I was crying, worrying about any future children I could have, and I swear to you I was getting depressed for her.And on that note, I must say I did like how Larson portrayed someone with a mental illness and didn't try to make it quirky, or even how the writer/ director Destin Cretton didn't write the mental illness to be something so debilitating that it stopped her from life. I mean, yes, she struggles being in a relationship, and even around kids who could be triggers, but despite all that happened, she still pushes on. And it was also nice to see a boyfriend who wasn't blindly supportive, but seemed to actual fit the type of emotions you'd imagine yourself having if you were in love with someone who was trying their best, but sometimes cracking under pressure.Leading me to talk about the two kids, or young people, Keith Stanfield and Kaitlyn Dever. Like I said in the Standing Up review, it is so rare that actors of juvenile age are allowed complex emotions that it makes it so when you see a child struggle with insecurity, past abuse, or other issues, it is so heart breaking. I mean, just thinking about these two actors performances have me panting like I was the one running, even if what I was running from was miles away. Stanfield's character, for example, in itself could have been its own movie, albeit it might mirror Precious, but stories like that do need to be told. And then with Dever, through her we see Larson's character Grace and the parallel is written so well that I'm mad at myself that I didn't hear about this movie while it was in theaters.CriticismReally, the only issue for me was that Grace gets pregnant in the film, and be it the fact Grace dresses in baggy clothes or consistency issues, she goes from once scene in which we can see a baby bump to her seeming like she isn't as far along as we thought. Also, I must admit, as much as I loved Larson and the other actors/characters aforementioned, I did feel that the shine they got was at the expense of everyone else. Malek and Beatriz essentially are just there, and while you understand not everyone can be given a developed background/ story, after you finish the film you do wonder about the other kids and staff there.Overall: Must SeeI don't care if it is on TV, VOD, Rental, or what have you, you should see Short Term 12. This is such a good indie film, one which shows what happens when the talent comes and is ready to work, and not simply the talent comes because of the money and that extrinsic motivation which comes from monetary gain. For, to me, this film is one of the few I would ever consider to almost be a ten, and though admittedly I'm sure this elation will dissipate, I doubt my admiration for Brie Larson after this film will. To me, this is definitely the type of film which makes you a fan.",Short Term 12

33,Sergeant_Tibbs,A passionate and powerful film headlined by Brie Larson's terrific performance.,8,3 November 2013,"At its core, Short Term 12 is a film about kids looking after kids. That youthful always-learning energy gives it a warmth and sincerity that's extremely endearing and a joy to watch these vulnerable and intriguing characters. It's about outcasts fitting in together and finding their place making it relatable for whenever you've felt alone and brings in a welcoming sense of community. It's Brie Larson's protagonist Grace who heads the entire ensemble on her shoulders. She gives a heartfelt performance, tough on the outside, swirling chaos on the inside, and she's able to get that on screen and develop it in every scene. In the way she is written, she shows the value of a nurturing character and how that can get the audience's sympathy regardless of any negative behaviour. The screenplay is terrific, juggling its arcs very efficiently and delivering comedy and drama in equal doses.It can get too comical or sentimental at times but its overall maturity cancels it out. With its hand-held photography, it has a raw aesthetic that cuts through potential contrivances and predictability and gives it an involving sense of authenticity. The majority of the scenes are long and dialogue driven, often reflecting on short sharp outbursts or telling stories within the story be it an anecdote, rap or children's story read aloud. It provides an ideal pace and length it to feel brisk yet able to breathe and feel like a fulfilling 90 minutes. It's a film about catharsis and connection after deep repression, and the fact it's about young people makes the tragedies hurt more and the sense of hope more touching. It does have a bad habit of using the cliché of misplaced anger a bit too often, where a character furious at someone will instead hit those closest to them, but the deep rooted empathy for these characters allows those moments to feel at least somewhat justified as we feel that intense release with them.The supporting performances are also fantastic, characters that although may follow a convention feel like they're coming from a genuine place. It's not often that a film like this would start its story with a relatively optimistic relationship as that dials down the potential for conflict, but John Gallagher Jr. and his chemistry with Larson makes it one we love watching and dread that moment where it inevitably goes wrong. Keith Stanfield is a standout from the younger crowd of actors whose powerful tenderness constantly gave me chills and Kaitlyn Denver who navigates around cliché and provides an earnest and passionate performance. Short Term 12 knows its deck has familiar cards, but it plays them just right. It's nice to have a film that knows that an original perspective is more engaging than original content. Despite its flaws, it's a really great emotional film and definitely the type of film I'd love to make. 8/10",Short Term 12

It's a rap song with many words and phrases that he's not allowed to say, but anybody watching will be laughing so hard that he probably can't be held responsible for every inappropriate thing in the song.There's a significant bit of drama unfolding in the foster care center, all of which can be very upsetting, but the beauty of ""Short Term 12"" is that the drama is folded into the comedy so realistically that it really is easy to like. The characters, particularly the supporting adults, are beautifully portrayed and allow the complexities, the flaws and graces, of our heroine Grace to evolve in their own time.",Short Term 12
35,bryank-04844,'Short Term 12' might just be the best film of the year.,10,22 August 2015,"Destin Daniel Cretton's film 'Short Term 12' is in my Top 5 films of the year. This candid look at life in a big group foster home for trouble kids is natural, endearing, and brutal all at the same time. I was completely moved and fell in love with each character in its 96 minute run-time, and didn't want to leave them when the credits started to roll. This film is more of an ensemble drama with Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr. taking the more meaty roles. This captivating film will pull at the heart strings, but won't leave you depressed like so many of these similar films have done before. I cannot wait to see this again and again.Grace (Larson) plays one of several adults who work at a sort of compound for troubled kids - or group home. These kids are supposed to be placed here temporarily, but often get overlooked by the system and end up staying long term. The goal is to get these kids to a good family who loves them. One of the other counselors is Mason (Gallagher), who is an amazing and funny laid back guy and is secretly dating Larson. Mason is the kind of guy you want to be life long friends with.The counselors are told strictly to create a safe environment and make sure none of the kids are hurting themselves or others. They are not to act as therapists, friends, or doctors. However, we see Grace and her fellow colleagues going above and beyond to make these kids feel genuinely loved, because in fact, they do love each of them. And we see that these kids feel more comfortable with Grace and Mason as they let them in on some of their horrible past that they won't even tell their real doctors or therapists.For instance, one of the older children in the home, Marcus (Keith Stanfield), an 18 year old, allows Mason to hear a rap he's been working on, which details his childhood from his prostitute mother who made him sell drugs and then beat him. Or when newbie Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the home and does not want to be a part of the system, she eventually opens up about her abusive life to Grace in the form of a kid's story she wrote, that might just be all too familiar for Grace herself, and we being to see that the counselors might have more in common with their kids than meets the eye.Every scene will leave you breathless with its charm and drama, and will make you want to give each of these characters a long hug. What's so great is that, this never feels overly done or go into explicit dark territory. The moments feel real and genuine and while you might look at this story on paper and think, ""This is gonna be rough"", you'll come out the other side with a smile on your face and will be glad you took the ride.Brie Larson deserves an acting award for her role in this film. She is a top notch actor, who I feel can compete with Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, and Helen Mirren. Her wit and emotional breakdowns are true-to-life, and even when she might be making a mistake, we still love her. Gallagher Jr. is as always amazing to watch on screen. His comedic timing and ability to deliver a story is impeccable. And Cretton's direction is beautiful and magical, and shows every little quirk in these characters.'Short Term 12' might just be the best film of the year.",Short Term 12
36,Likes_Ninjas90,An unexpectedly moving character study about welfare and painful upbringings,8,21 December 2013,"After he graduated from college, Hawaiian-born filmmaker Destin Cretton worked in a group home for troubled teenagers. In 2008 he released a twenty minute short film called Short Term 12, which was a fictional drama based on some of his own experiences with these kids. This full length film uses some of the very same scenes as the short and retains one of the core character relationships. Sometimes when some short films are expanded to full length they can feel overstretched because the filmmakers do not know how to appropriate the concept and script to an entire feature. Yet Cretton has done an exceptional job in retaining the short's verisimilitude while expanding his thematic goals through an extensive reworking of the inner life of the main character too. In the short film the main supervisor character was a man. Here the same role has been written as a woman and is played by twenty-four year old actress Brie Larson (The Spectacular Now, 21 Jump Street), who gives a colossal performance as Grace. She is a tough, strict but also deeply caring supervisor who is in charge of looking after a number of teenagers with several workers, including her partner Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). There are a number of threads in the film, including Grace's pregnancy, a new worker who is introduced to the facility and a troubled Black teen. The most significant plot point though is the arrival of Jayden (a brilliantly anxious Kaitlyn Dever), a suicidal, self-harming girl whose experiences become a mirror of Grace's own past, and gradually unravels her own psychological stability. Cretton's screenplay is clear and well organised, balancing several arcs and providing dramatic weight to both the adult and teenager characters, and sometimes overlapping their experiences. The major transformation of making the main character a woman instead of a man pays off because it strengthens the credibility of the relationship between Jayden and Grace. It allows the exposition of Grace's own horrific upbringing to be slowly unearthed through this very tentative relationship defined by duty but also a great deal of empathy too. Their relationship is also indicative of Cretton's central theme, which he also expanded upon thoroughly from the short. He is interested in the conflict generated by caring for others needs, such as how this can be detrimental to one's own personal well-being. This is verbalised in a bizarre but funny opening story that Mason tells about chasing a kid who escaped but then defecates in his own pants at the same time. Failed parentage is also pertinent in the script with several characters disappointed or damaged by their upbringing or fearful of being a parent. Another success for the film is that Brie's personal life and love story doesn't detract from the realism and grit of the facility. Both threads complement each other. As the behaviour of the kids like Jayden grows more erratic and violent, Mason and Grace's relationship sits on a knife-edge. There are also agonising scenes of self-harm and verbal breakdowns in this film but one of the improvements as a feature film is that there are breathing spaces between the climaxes. None of these moments are gratuitous or exploitative, but believably gruelling and spontaneous jolts of uncontrollable emotions and behaviour, captured vividly through hand-held cameras and a minimalist visual style. The mood is often alleviated with surprising humour too. Given the subject matter, audiences might be surprised how many big laughs there are in the film. All the actors, including the young teenagers, show unwavering commitment in their roles. Brie Larson gives a star-making performance of palpable confidence and strength. She also plays the character as having a tentative personal life under her hardened exterior, revealing the most confronting details about her upbringing. We understand this character from her past as much as her actions. Grace's desperation to protect Jayden echoes her own past and her future as she thinks about how her own father's imminent release from prison. There is only one belated scene where her character's actions begin to wobble the foundations of credibility. Just as she reaches the apex of irrationalism, Cretton pulls the scene back at the right moment. John Gallagher Jr. is funny and highly charismatic as Mason and his character is also provided with a surprising but brief scene where we fully come to understand his character from his childhood. These portraits summarise the film: it is a minor tale in its scale and cinematic form, but the performances and the writing are so intimately drawn that it becomes an unexpectedly moving character study about welfare and painful upbringings.",Short Term 12
37,face-819-933726,"Girl Interrupted, tries making a difference.",8,8 January 2014,"Here we go! Nice little slice of life movie. They really chose the right time to pop into these folks little bit of life, and you will be glad they did. Broken people who as usual once they are ""reformed"" mostly end up working to help ""reform"" other broken people, it's just how the cycle works to repair itself. In this story we have a great cast of counseling staff, and some very distant but obviously caring Doctors, and a mixed up bunch of over all really good kids who are all in need of real help, and support. All three levels are played by a supreme fringe cast of people who are all just about to break out in the real world, and this movie is going to nothing but improve their chances. The two lead female rolls are two young women you will see more, and more of in the next few months, and if they make the right moves they could do very very well. The story is a nice one, not a light fluffy tale about bunnies, but a real life tale of Monsters, and the only way to really get away, if you ever do. (I hope you do) I really Enjoyed the movie for the cast, and the skill in portraying these broken people who all understand how to help others, but not themselves as we all are. The story was good, short I think, but it had all of the needed elements so why drag on? I would recommend this film to anyone out there who will admit to being a bit broken, and especially to those who won't admit there is a problem, you need this movie. (heck you need help)",Short Term 12
38,maccas-56367,"Solid, with strong performances, but majorly overhyped and rated.",6,9 November 2019,"Cue unpopular opinion #2914 of mine...This was nowhere near as amazing or special as everyone seems to rave about.Short Term 12 undoubtedly has a lot of heart and means well. You just want everyone to live happily ever after and to work through their problems. Despite it being bookended by some great storytelling, it still came across like an ordinary 'slice of life' film to me.Brie Larson is one of the greatest actresses around today. It was cool seeing her alongside Rami Malek. I incorrectly assumed we would grow to know each of the characters featured on a somewhat deep level. While I cared about them, I still feel like things just grazed the surface and went by somewhat superficially.Were there some sad stories? Sure. But I didn't cry or experience any of the emotions I thought I possibly would - and what so many other viewers have talked about.There was nothing here that stood out as being remarkable. It's a well made indie film featuring two acting superstars before their careers reached into the stratosphere, and that's about where things end.",Short Term 12
39,rajdoctor,Demands your emotional investment,8,20 May 2018,"Writer Director Destin Daniel Cretton created this full length feature from his Oscar nominated short by the same name. It is based on his own experiences of working with teenagers.Grace (Brie Larsen) plays the protagonist, the young supervisor of a group facility with young troubled teenagers. She with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr) focus their attention on short-tempered talented rapper kid Marcus (Lakeith Stanfield). Grace builds an intimate bond with a new inmate Jayden (Katlyen Daver) to make her feel comfortable in the new home with other kids. In the process Grace learns about Jayden's abusive past through her metaphorical story of octopus and shark. The movie presents every day challenges of working at such facilities where abuse, emotional trauma, fights, self-harm, depression, fights etc. are common. A love story between Grace and Mason, both with a past of troubled kids themselves, is built in as a sub-plot.The director Daniel handles the subject with confidence, expertise, a keen-eye to detail, psychology and tenderness. Even though the movie is heart-breaking at places Daniel does not burden the screenplay with depressing heaviness and gives a heart-warming light feel throughout the movie.It is a short movie with 96 minutes running time and it is worth watching and one immediately connects with the main characters of the movie.The main led - Brie and John - were auditioned by Daniel via skype after sending them scripts via emails. The shooting of the movie took place only in 20 days with free flowing acts with main characters improvising on the dialogue and actions on their own. The movie is widely acclaimed and have won 35 awards and 70 nominations. Those who are working with NGO / NPO with less privileged people will definitely identify with the movie.I am going with 7.75 out of 10 for the movie",Short Term 12
40,cliftonofun,"Real, devastating, and hopeful",10,26 December 2017,This movie just destroyed me. Maybe it's because I am a former social worker. Maybe it's because I worked in a residence program. Maybe it's because I worked with youth once. Or maybe it's because this movie grasped that story does not need to be contrived. Just take some real characters and real emotions and real conflict. Mix well and: done. The filmmaker opted for show instead of tell. And it showed.,Short Term 12
41,SquigglyCrunch,"Great Performances, Great Acting, Great Idea",8,31 January 2016,"Ever since watching Room (2015) I've become a pretty big fan of Brie Larson. So when this movie came up as one of her better movies I figured I should give it a watch. I had very little idea what to expect, and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. Short Term 12 has an interesting idea that I haven't really seen. It's about underprivileged kids temporarily in a shelter while a new home for them is being searched for. It's primarily focused on the people running the shelter, and it's not just about them working with the kids. The characters are very well done. Like I said above, it's not just about them working with the kids. About half of it is about their outside lives, and half is about their work lives. But even if it'd been just about their jobs it still would have been great. Their characters are developed super well through their actors, all of whom deliver performances that make them feel genuine. They don't just feel like actors, they actually feel like real people. Their life struggles are realistic too, and while sometimes I felt like some characters were pouring themselves out anime-style (where they go into detailed explanations of their past), it was never pointless and it was in moderation. Plus they didn't include pointless details, everything about the characters pasts that were talked about were talked about briefly, like how a real person would tell their life story. But they only tell parts that are relevant, so it's nice that they didn't go into unimportant details like anime often does. The handful of children chosen to focus on are well- picked, as they are the ones who'd receive the most amount of attention. There's no real point in focusing on characters that don't cause any problems or need to be focused on, because most kids aren't horrible troublemakers. There will always be a select few though, and those are the ones focused on. Overall Short Term 12 just did everything right. It's got great characters that aren't perfect but still feel real and an interesting plot. I can see myself or anyone giving this movie an extremely high rating, but to me it just wasn't amazing. There's nothing wrong with it, it just isn't higher than an 8/10. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie to just about anyone who cares about characters as much as I do.",Short Term 12
42,ethanbresnett,Something very special,9,28 December 2020,"Short Term 12 is a very visceral experience. I'm left a bit speechless after watching it truth be told. It is so full of emotional power, devastating blows, heartfelt moments, and as a result just feels so real.This is mostly due to the absolutely flawless performances from a stacked cast. As if Brie Larson wasn't enough, we are treated to Rami Malek, Kaitlyn Dever and LaKeith Stanfield. All of them were fantastic, and the on screen moments shared by Brie and Kaitlyn were so raw and touching, the real highlight of the film.I wouldn't necessarily say that Short Term 12 has a plot to comment on per se, more a collection of character arcs and explorations which are done so well. The characters were so well written, so delicately done and with great nuance and feeling. Particularly the characters of Grace played by Brie. Her performance was so sensitive, and understated, and absolutely perfect.I could go on about this film, but instead of wasting time reading my review just go ahead and watch it and enjoy a masterful hidden gem of a film.",Short Term 12

Generally I am a sucker for the quieter,low key,understated art films. I love watching them and 5 minutes into Short Term 12, I really thought this movie might be something special. But alas, things didn't work out like that !!!I won't go so far as to saying I didn't like this at all, but when your expectations get raised, your critical senses start to work overtime to find flaws in the film. That might have been the case here, but for me this film as a whole is a let down. After having started well, it became less and less convincing and a number of scenes and even the acting in those scenes seemed very contrived. Specially after the hour mark, I thought the director shelved all efforts to tell a genuine,real story and resorted to the practice of tying together the different plot angles very conveniently to ensure that we arrive at the happiest possible ending under the circumstances. There are bits and pieces of brilliance scattered throughout the film, but in a comprehensive sense, it failed to have the emotional effect that I expected it to have on me.",Short Term 12
44,shawneofthedead,"A bruised, uplifting tale of surviving in the crush and tragedy of everyday life.",8,16 May 2014,"As per the dictates of conventional Hollywood wisdom, films like Short Term 12 just don't get made. There's little to no demand, or so the argument would go, for a glum, tiny film about troubled kids trying to survive in a halfway house run by adults with just as many problems as their charges. It's precisely why Destin Cretton's smart, gritty film occasionally feels like a minor miracle, one so truthfully played that it manages to be painfully gloomy and unexpectedly uplifting at the same time.Grace (a wonderful Brie Larson) works at a foster-care facility that takes in troubled, frequently transient children without homes of their own (hence the title of the film: few kids wind up staying longer than twelve months). But even as she tries to soothe the churning darkness eating up kids like broody Marcus (Keith Stanfield) and mouthy Luis (Kevin Hernandez), she must come to terms with her own problems. When Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the facility, Grace finds herself getting dragged back into her own troubled emotional history. As a result, she pulls away from Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), her perhaps- boyfriend and colleague in the facility.Where Short Term 12 really works is in its careful, skilled development of its characters. At the film's heart sits Grace, who's barely older than some of the kids in her charge –she presents a firm, comforting face to them, but hides beneath it her own reservoir of doubts and concerns. Her horrifying story is told in layers and chapters, peeled away as she gets closer to Jayden and pulls away from Mason.Even though Grace may take centre stage, and rightfully so, there's also plenty of room to explore the secret miseries and worries of even the most minor of characters. There's a story of extreme heartbreak tucked away in the form of Sammy (Alex Calloway), a boy who clings to his dolls and toys to avoid dealing with anything resembling the real world. The introduction of Nate (Rami Malek), a new colleague at the facility, allows the film to juxtapose the choices of the privileged against the predicaments of the underprivileged.In fact, Short Term 12 takes a good, hard look at the kids who usually get lost in the system: chewed up by bureaucracy and forgotten by the authorities, and typically assumed to be problematic and best left at the fringes of society. But the film suggests that, in this most unlikely, jail-like of environments, some kids can find the safety and comfort they need to grow up. It's a cycle, we soon realise, as we gain further insights into why Grace and Mason have wound up working where they do, in largely thankless jobs.Truthfully, Cretton's film falters in the home stretch. There is plenty of reason for hope and humanity in this world Cretton has created. But, for a film so unrelentingly realistic, it stumbles into an ending that seems almost too pat and too simple for the complex webs of relationships, problems and secrets it has otherwise so carefully woven.Laced through with an unswerving helping of hope, Short Term 12 is richer, smarter and darker than you might expect. Ostensibly, it's about bad kids making good, and that should be inspiring and bland in true Hollywood fashion. But, although the film drifts uncomfortably close to that territory in the end, it can be forgiven the digression for its insightful, effective exploration of so many big ideas about humanity and its capacity to survive pretty much anything.",Short Term 12
45,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,This week's reason to keep subscribing to Netflix,9,27 June 2014,"I enjoyed this film enormously. Obviously some aspects of life in a group home for at-risk teenagers may have been softened and sweetened to fit the requirements of a 90-minute indie film that doesn't set out to be totally tragic, like something by the Dardenne brothers or Ken Loach. Brie Larson is both appealing and convincing as Grace, an empathetic and effective staffer who starts to lose it after she bonds with a new resident (beautifully played by Kaitlyn Dever with just the right amount of prickly reserve) whose case history reminds her too much of her own. Good work by John Gallagher Jr. (""The Newsroom"") as her coworker/secret boyfriend; typical of the tight script that he's given a backstory that seems just right for his character. Nice too to see an indie film where the characters are something more than love-starved geeks or aimless hipsters. We hadn't heard anything about this one until it turned up on Netflix, though, as other reviewers have noted, it seems immeasurably more original and interesting than some of the overpraised mainstream product (""Gravity,"" ""Philomena"") that was coming out at the same time.",Short Term 12

I hadn't high hopes for it, but I was expecting something out of the standards. But no. I didn't find the film that I wanted in Short Term 12. The film that I found in Short Term 12 was exactly the one was I feared to find since the beginning. A film without any ambition other than being a smaller version of the Hollywood industry.I mean, that story of someone taking care of a place with a bunch of mentally prejudiced people isn't something exactly fresh. And the characters were way too boring. Too normal, conventional. Even the 'mad' youngsters were uninteresting, mainly because of their generic acting skills. Jayden character was so far the most interesting in the whole film. Katlyn Dever brought energy to her character, something that all the others, in the way I see it, couldn't accomplish.I also didn't liked the sketchy music and some moments of the film seemed way too clichéd and manipulative. All the situation with Marcus cutting himself(character that had a wasted potential in the story) was forced in my opinion. Artistically, Short Term 12 is a very limited film.But the high points of the film are worthy. I really liked Jayden's character and the film's approach in a 'character study'. The only problem, a big problem, is in the characters, that aren't interesting. 6.6/10",Short Term 12
47,doug_park2001,"""You are the weirdest, most beautiful person I've met in my whole entire life""",9,6 April 2014,"{8.5 stars}SHORT TERM 12 is a plainly produced yet startlingly realistic film about a treatment facility for troubled adolescents. Brie Larson (""Grace"") and John Gallagher (""Mason"") give fine performances as the young staff members who must be simultaneously authoritarian, self-effacing, firm, gentle, and everything else a particular moment requires. The way they lose themselves in order to find themselves in this consuming, exhausting job, the kinship they share with the teenagers, and the one they lack with the upper administration is ultra-real. Equally impressive is Stephanie Beatriz as Jessica, full of rage and estranged from her family for good reasons the film reveals. That being said, everyone in this film is quite convincing.While it may be a little inconclusive in one or two spots, the plot is still compelling, with some truly disturbing surprises and revelations. SHORT TERM 12 also does a splendid job of balancing comedy and tragedy, connecting them together with various things that fall under both categories. Though plenty happens here, this film may be too unspectacular for some tastes. It's definitely not a ""thriller,"" and sensationalism would obviously have ruined it.I recommend SHORT TERM 12 to anyone who's ever been a teenager.",Short Term 12

1. The score helps to set a suitably soft and vulnerable atmosphere.
2. There are brilliant performances by Brie Larson (Grace), John Gallagher Jr. (Mason), Rami Malek (Nate), LaKeith Stanfield (Marcus), and Kaitlyn Dever (Jayden).
3. The comedy is inserted both naturally and appropriately, and stems from genuine and grounded character interactions.
4. The cinematography is fantastically simple, but effective. The camera zoom-ins on the characters in particular help to heighten the emotions.
5. All of the actors have incredible chemistry with each other, but especially Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr., as well as Brie Larson and Kaitlyn Dever.
6. All of the tender and emotional scenes land with hard-hitting and powerful impacts.
7. The ending is beautiful, poetic, and it rounds off the story wondrously.Cons:
1. Grace, as a white woman, knowing how to cut Marcus' hair (he's black) is a little unlikely. This is a nit-pick, but there is a reason why black barbers exist.
2. Sammy (Alex Calloway) and Luis (Kevin Balmore) have story-lines that get nowhere near as much attention as the others, and it's a real shame.",Short Term 12

It's the story of a group home for wayward teens and the counselors who work with them, but words and labels can't do it justice. It's simply a perfect film with deeply felt performances throughout. The filmmakers bring such authenticity to it that it feels like it could be a documentary.We follow Grace, played by Brie Larson, an early twenty something girl, as she leads most of the groups activities. She is in a relationship with fellow counselor Mason (Peter Gallegher Jr.) that they try to keep on the down low in front of the others, but everyone seems to know. We are also introduced to a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek) who like most people initially has a rough time fitting in. Trying to make a good first impression on these kids is nearly impossible and when he calls them ""underprivileged"" Marcus, the eldest of the group, is deeply offended by the term. It really is like a slap in the face to all of them. Although Nate didn't mean anything by it and is good guy at heart he has a lot to learn.Short Term 12 offers these kids unconditional love and support and a safe place for them to just be themselves. All of the residents, through no fault of there own, have ended up at there and must wait out their time until fate revels itself or they turn eighteen and must leave. All of the teens are well crafted multi-dimensional characters as complicated and real as it gets. Sammy, Luis, Marcus and the new girl Jayden are the main teens we follow throughout the film. Through their struggles they've built up these thick walls in order to keep everybody out and It's the counselors job to slowly but surely chip away at these walls and try to make a connection. Sammy is no more than 10 or 12 years old and has lost his only family in his younger sister. He might either be autistic or depressed but is really battling though some tough times for such a young age. Like all of the residents Luis is a good kid but a victim of circumstance. Marcus is a deeply complex man who soon turns eighteen and still fighting through some fierce emotional issues. The abuse by his mother has left deep emotion scars, but he seems up to challenge to reclaiming his life. Jayden is the new girl and almost a carbon copy of what Grace was like when she was her age. Jayden sparks something inside Grace that force her to deal with her own brutal past. Life is now pushing Grace to a boiling point as her past, present and future all collide and she must make decision that will affect her life forever.",Short Term 12

Even though the shaky cam is noticeable from the start, you get used to it and it adds the realism and drama and it didn't bother me at all.All in all, decent story, good performances (I like Brie Larson before she became Captain Marvel), decent directing and simple and sufficient cinematography, but the story and characterization and character development is lacking, so it's a 7/10 for me.",Short Term 12

If you see any films this month, makes sure this is one of themFirst time helmer Destin Cretton, with two years' experience in a similar care-giving facility (The title refers to the 12 or so group homes for teens in the county), has masterfully relayed the love and sorrow inherent in a place where virtually everyone is displaced from a parent, or abused, even the staff.The story belongs to Grace (Brie Larson), a caring giver who influences for good many of her charges, not easy cases any one of them. Part of the reason she is so successful is that she knows from abuse by her father, who is in prison for his offenses. She finds a younger Doppelganger of sorts in defiant teen Jadyn (Kaitlyn Dever), whose traumas at the hands of her father are ongoing and call for identifying with Grace's experiences and strong remedy. Watch for an Oscar nomination if this indie is seen by enough of us.To parallel the challenges of the home, Grace's home with fellow staffer, boyfriend Mason is both loving and stressful because she struggles with becoming pregnant and reconciling her tortured past with her father, who is ready to be released form prison. Mason is the ideal caregiver, loving and competent with the teenagers and her.Although many moments could be melancholic or downright tear-jerking in other hands, Cretton doesn't allow excessive sorrow to rule; rather, the sadness is mitigated by the small triumphs.

53,lucasnochez,Review: Short Term 12/Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,10,1 December 2013,"It isn't uncommon that after I leave a deeply affecting, emotional roller-coaster of a film that I am left speechless. Contrary to its title, the effects that Short Term 12 leaves you with are anything but short term. In what has become one of the most personal films of 2013, has also been one of my most challenging reviews to write. Ironically enough, Short Term 12 is also one of the most rewarding and mandatory films of the year. Thankfully, there is just too much to share about writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton film that can't be left unsaid. The film tenderly explores the lives of tormented souls who have faced and are forced to conquer the lasting repercussions of sexual and other violent abuse. For that, Short Term 12 is a weary yet rewarding film that refuses to beg for empathy. Instead it chooses to be a galvanic and delicate narrative intent on telling a story right. More below! The beauty of Short Term 12 lies in its profusely believable dialogue and story-telling techniques. Whether it be sharing intimate details of the lives of the foster-cares 'at risk youth'; lyrically, poetically or prosaically, writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton creates a film which the characters render the deepest and darkest corners of your heart, while never being melodramatic. Cretton has already explored this world in his Jury Prize winner short in 2009 at Sundance, and whatever politics surround the film as to why his newest feature which expands the world of his short was not included in the Sundance line-up this year, has yet to be explored. Unfortunately for Sundance, this is one feature film that compliments some of its illustrious winners, specifically my top film of 2013 Fruitvale Station, in admirable fashion.The real heart and soul of the film is Brie Larson who plays Grace, supervisor to the fragile youth inhabiting short term 12. The facility itself, a voluntary juvenile centre in California, is a home that throughout the film, creates constant wonder, sharing in the joys and pains of its guests. Acting as teacher, big sister and disciplinarian to the youth, Grace along with her secret lover and boyfriend Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.) are a tag-team duo. Together they create a healthy and safe environment where the youth are forced to lead lives that include healthy ways of communication and a healthy outlet for anger, fear and other very overpowering emotions.When we first meet Grace and Mason, who have tried to keep their relationship a secret to everyone at the centre, life is anything but perfect. Sharing an awkward and impulsively aggressive love-life, we realize that, like with so many 'inspiration-teacher genre' films, the teachers have just as many problems as their students. Deep-rooted in physical and sexual abuse, the two protagonists go on serving as uncompromising examples to the youth in the facility. It is with the arrival of Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) that Grace's world is shaken to its core. Sheltered in her headphones wielded with angst-worthy music, Grace begins to connect with Jayden through drawing portraits and telling stories. As Jayden faces the deep secrets of her life and the dark corners of her past, Grace begins to do the same upon the news of her father's upcoming parole. Questioning her role as a partner to Mason and expecting mother, Grace is unhinged and begins a decent into a path of self-destruction.Each character in Short Term 12 gracefully begins to take similar faces to people in our own lives. The performances in the film, lead or supporting, are familiar reminders of uplifting success stories or tragic shadows of old loved-ones. Stand-out performances include that of the eldest short term patron, Marcus (the outstanding Keith Stanfield) who upon approaching his eighteenth birthday is forced to leave short term 12. Marcus along with Mason share some of the most compelling, witty, and powerful scenes together involving nothing less than a bongo-drum or hair-clippers.One of the issues that could have easily plagued the film was its overwrought subject matter and its ability to be preachy. Cretton, who admitted to having a position similar to his protagonists in his youth, instead opts for a very unnoticed ""fly on the wall"" filming approach that allows the film to explore the many hypocrisies that fill the 'inspiration-teacher genre' uninterrupted. Cretton creates deep characters with meaningful roles that share the same issues as their patients. Never lumpy, the overall commentary on listening to your own advice, institutionalized help and the role of care-givers juxtaposed directly against those of therapists and psychologists is revealing yet unwaveringly passionate.The authenticity of Short Term 12 as a whole is quite refreshing. Cretton, who exchanges the glamorous for the intimate, tells us a real story of ordinary people with real problems, never down-playing the impact of each trauma, no matter how small or how big. Throughout Grace's journey of healing, Cretton shows how life is filled with interchanging teacher/pupil roles and how regardless of age, we learn from one another.Larson is destined to become a force worth reckoning with thanks to her portrayal in Short Term 12. Larson's heartwarming yet weary depiction of a rehabilitated character really brings home Mason's description of Grace, where ""weird and beauty come together"". Grace's willingness to abandon all physical beauty as well as her joy to share deep emotional and mental insight to her children is never compromised. Larson is revelatory as a person raising a helpful hand to a small minority of the American population that is generally outcasted and ignored.Never in a million years would I have thought that a film full of monologues, including a monologue about someone shitting their pants, literally and figuratively, would have made it on my list of best films of the year. But much like the film itself, Short Term 12 is an unexpected diamond in the rough.Like this review? Check out the rest of it at www.nightfilmreviews.com",Short Term 12
54,pere-25366,An incredibly raw and authentic work of art; This is without a doubt one of 2013's best,9,22 April 2019,"Few films are able to be as authentic, raw and true-to-life as Destin Daniel Cretton's second feature film, Short Term 12 (2013). The screenplay (which began as Cretton's thesis project at grad school which he THEN turned into a short film before adapting it to feature length material) is incredibly nuanced and perceptive. The audience slowly learns just how similar the kids and adults are and the way this unfolds is simply magnificent, wonderfully executed. Art, for example, is a frequent commonality which subtly connects both the adults and kids. Creativity is clearly something to which Cretton can relate and this effortlessly shines through the story, its characters and film as a whole. The acting by legitimately every single person is outstanding and honestly, this film just finds a way to move you in so many ways. Thank you Destin Daniel Cretton for this wonderful work of art - I loved every second of it.",Short Term 12
55,maximovlE,That hit hard!,10,31 October 2021,"Went into this one with no preconceptions. I knew nothing about it, so I had no idea where it was going to go.The shaky cam nearly killed it, but thankfully the acting was so good I couldn't even tell you if there was still shaky cam after the first quarter. Still, movie makers, stop the shaky cam crap already!So what can I say without spoilers? I dunno. It was simple, engaging... I spend most movies on my phone, googling, imdbing... Didn't on this one .I was very much aware of Brie as Captain Marvel, so to see here here doing something incredibly different was delightful. Her credibility as an actress in my opinion has risen enormously and I want to see more.Not my usual sort of movie, and I really don't know how to talk about it without ruining the plot, but every now and then a movie like this comes along and grips me. So, no matter what your usual type of movie is, if you're contemplating this, just do it. It's good.",Short Term 12
56,Davalon-Davalon,But what did they say?,6,24 August 2015,"I watched this movie specifically because the script won a Nicholl Fellowship. I wanted to see what the Academy thought was a good script. It may be that the script was great, I don't know. But as far as the execution: Almost every actor, even those that actually had talent, mumbled their lines, spoke too softly, spoke into themselves, whispered... it was almost impossible to understand what anyone was saying. That did not help make this a watchable film. That aside, the beginning, with its insane ""sh*t-in-pants"" story that went on ad infinitum, was not entertaining. It was a ruse to set us all at ease to allow one of the nutcase teens from the house to run out screaming. This was used to also bookend the film. The problem with the first one is we meet 4 people almost at once, we don't who they are, why they are there or what they do. They are also talking about people we don't know or care about. None of them has what I would call ""star quality.""I did not find it an effective way to start the film and I found it almost impossible to keep track of who was who. It took about 40 minutes before the film became interesting. And then, I will give it credit, and it's because of Kaitlyn Dever as the deeply troubled ""Jayden"" and Brie Larson as ""Grace."" These were the two strongest actors in the film and their unusual shared story... although a bit predictable -- drew me in and kept me with them till the end. I found the film to be sloppily shot and it resembled a total indie package. The sound quality was all over the place. I had to have my finger on the volume control the entire time. That said, the concept for the story was interesting. There were WAY too many people introduced up front and the story should have honed a more narrow path and stayed with Grace. By not doing so, it spread itself so thin that I was waiting for the entire thing to crumble. Still... it had some level of uniqueness. But I have several problems with the film which I cannot explain. There seemed to be 4 ""handlers"" and one ""adminstrator."" Can someone explain why the 4 handlers were standing outside having a chatfest when they KNEW that there was a houseful of troubled teens that might do ANYTHING (i.e. cut themselves, harm others, etc.)? It was incomprehensible. Also, since Grace was pregnant and her fiancé Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) knew she was pregnant, why is it that he allowed her to CHARGE after Jayden? What man in his right mind would let her do that, knowing she was pregnant? Why would he say to the other handlers, ""It's okay."" In what realm of the imagination could it be okay? Katilyn definitely has some bite in her performance and I sense she might go somewhere. Brie also has a feeling that something great might come her way. Other than the two of them, I wasn't sensing any breakout stars. An interesting watch, but very, very depressing, with lots of ""f"" words -- most if not all which were completely unnecessary.",Short Term 12
57,rdg45,Help Me Help You,7,2 May 2018,"Adults, who as teens, had troubled past help teens who have a troubled past in a home for about a year before they are released. Well written and performed and well worth the time to view this film.",Short Term 12
58,themissingpatient,"Authentic, chaotic and yet tender",9,20 January 2014,"It's Nate's first day working at a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers. His boss, Grace, is a young counselor that manages the place, which isn't too far off being a psych-ward for children. After a long day on the emotional roller-coaster that is her job, Grace finds out she is pregnant. This news causes her to begin to unravel, pushing her boyfriend away and showing a darker side when she relates too closely with a new patient.Though the film opens with a story told through dialogue that is reminiscent of Kevin Smith, there is not anything else in this film that is immature. As Grace, Brie Larson gives one of the best performances by an actress seen in 2013. John Gallagher Jr. as her boyfriend, Mason, is impossible not to like. Even great performances by all the children.Writer/director Destin Cretton shows deep insight into this world. The interactions and bonds between Grace and the kids are all too real. A very powerful feature film debut. There's some unnecessary shaky camera work in places but this is easily looked past due to how authentic the story is.Short Term 12 is chaotic at times, and rises to an intense climax. Yet, it is also tender and heart-warming, making it one of the best films of the year.",Short Term 12
59,IamROCKAS,An emotional journey that leaves you wanting more,6,24 May 2021,"Short Term 12 is a movie that has the power to influence you emotionally. For one, the narrative revolves around young adults who supervise a foster care facility. A different spin on the coming-of-age genre opens up different opportunities. Secondly, every single resident at the facility is relatable from one angle or another. We didn't get to explore their stories as it doesn't completely revolve around them but you just wish you knew a bit more about them. And lastly, the subject of past trauma can make you heartsick. Sometimes even despondent but Grace's emotional support to the resident provides the needed enthusiasm that doesn't let the heart grow cold. Even though she's the one struggling with past trauma, she doesn't give up on the kids.This movie featured several actors that would appear in cinema or publications in the future. Just two years after Short Term 12 was released, Rami Malek, who played Nate, got to star in Mr. Robot, a personal favorite of mine in the 2010s. Grace was played by Brie Larson, who got to join Marvel Cinematic Universe as Captain Marvel. She was also starred in Room (2015), which is rated really high, but I'm yet to watch that movie. The third actress that I want to mention is Kaitlyn Dever. She played Jayden, the tough but frail girl with a history of harming herself, and she also starred in one of my favorite comedies in the recent past - Booksmart (2019). One thing that I like about watching a lot of movies is seeing some familiar faces from time to time. I know these three actors from movies of completely different backgrounds and seeing them interact in such circumstances, under such roles, and just seeing a different angle of their talent as actors were pleasant for my viewing experience.Even though I liked this film a lot, it fails in comparison to other coming-of-age movies and even some of my favorite dramas. The biggest strengths here are the acting and the use of tools to bring out a huge emotional response but it's a bit weaker in storytelling and the pace. It was a bit difficult what kind of story is being told here as it was mostly revolving around personal problems that Grace is dealing with and how the foster house residents remind her of the demons that haunt her past. To me, it sometimes felt that every sequence in the territory of the foster home was fascinating to some extent but every shot that was taken outside of it just didn't have enough charm to keep it interesting. I don't know whether this is the result of using the angle of young adults instead of the kids at the foster home or just the lack of scenes that are worth remembering or maybe even the fact that the most important scenes of the film, the ones that are supposed to have the highest impact, are a bit underwhelming. My favorite scenes here would include the rap by Marcus, the story by Jayden, and the stories at the beginning and end of the movie, Mason just has a knack for storytelling and I love it. The underwhelming scenes here would include the one where they smash the car with a baseball ball, Grace and Mason falling out because of Grace being afraid to open up, and, I guess, Jayden's violent tantrum after her father fails to pick her up from the facility. That sequence was really strong and acted well but I just felt awkward when watching it, it was uneasy to experience that.Overall, I'd still say I like it. It wasn't as impactful as The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), a movie that also dealt with past traumas, or Frances Ha (2012), a movie that dealt with someone desperately trying to hold on to her past, but it still stood out and gave me a warm fuzzy feeling when viewing. Those two movies are among my favorites of the genre in the 2010s and I don't dare to say that anything worse than them is automatically bad. Usually, I'm a bit discouraged when films are too long but here, I kind of wished it was longer so we would get to see more of the kinds, maybe having a bigger ending or maybe looking into what's hurting the other residents in the foster house. I just felt like I wanted more and this movie had more to deliver but just didn't share it, at least it felt like that. But besides that, I'm happy with what I've got.",Short Term 12
60,RobTortureWright,"Real, Dramatic and Captivating Insight.",8,29 September 2016,"An incredible look at the gritty life of a carer for underprivileged kids and what challenges they and the children of Short Term 12 face on a day by day basis. I really admired Brie Larson's performance as a carer who was also once in those kids shoes, a product of rape and incest she struggles to keep it together and find her own clarity as well as trying her best for those in need. A lot of this film is dealing with how life's struggles can really pile up and how its never a good thing to keep feelings and thoughts bottled up, Thus this film delivers a valuable life lesson along the way. Although I believe I have seen a very similar film I still feel that Short Term 12 is original, unique and not afraid to look at the harsh realities of life as a care worker and that's why I loved this film and it makes a great addition to the collection.",Short Term 12
61,aldri-feb,Surprisingly soulful and rich emotions,9,21 July 2014,"Not every year we find a film like this, ""Short Term 12"" is a rare independent drama that successfully exploits brilliant premise and limited production material into a powerful cinematic experience. It finely attach audiences sympathy with it's character study and every scenes in this movie has it's moment to capture many emotions that is required. Hilarious, anger, sad and warms was combined perfectly to fit it's limited running time. The main reason what wins it is a compelling yet honest script from Destin Daniel Cretton (who takes control as director too) that turns a simple story into a meaningful, soulful and heartwarming drama. Also the appearance of young casts in this movie couldn't be underestimated. The name like Kevin Hernandez, Keith Stanfield and Kaitlyn Dever got same portions to be a scene stealer also supports John Gallagher-Brie Larson to shine as leading actors. Especially for Brie Larson, she easily drags audiences attention with her performance as Grace, a kind-hearted woman who dedicated her life to help dangerous behavior kids though herself still struggles with her horrible and complex memory in the past.

63,supatube,Being a product of circumstance over free thinking.,5,17 March 2014,"I will have to agree with the boredom rating of this film. It's one of those films that does well at festivals because viewers tend to soak up aspects wholeheartedly in that type of setting whereas home viewing does not, i can put something else on, and although I endeavored to watch it to the end, like all films, I was not enthralled. Its slow, and boring, with so much music rolling over every scene. It may be an indie film but it is definitely not a cult classic, there is just nothing to 'love' about it, and by definition alone a cult needs to be loved or at least liked and this film will just not reach that kind of status. Why?The acting - Great, but hardly off the wall to make it cultist in the slightest. The story - Hardly avant-garde, not thought provoking, slow, depressing, infuriating... clearly the ingredients for a spellbound time...? lacking cultishness, obviously. But in the end its a story that has been told before, of an ineffective system and it's tiring watching weak people in a bad system. The filming - Its not groundbreaking, in fact its so late 90's its not even original.Music - incessant, and unflinching in trying to keep the tone lighthearted.Short Term 12 doesn't come close to holding a candle to the likes of ""12 Years a Slave"", ""Gravity"" or ""Her"". The days of slow paced Oscar winners was not for 2014, and rightfully so. If ""Rush"" wasn't getting a nomination, or ""Stoker"" then I hardly see it fit to garnish one to a mediocre drama that shows more pros for indifference than excellence.",Short Term 12

Brie Larson, I was not familiar with her work before this film and I must say the whole time I was watching her I was thinking this is the new Meryl Streep. She give a very powerful performance.
John Gallagher is better than average as Bries boyfriend. If he is half as nice off the screen as he was on it he should father a lot of kids!
This story is not new. Troubled teens and staff at a Short Term Foster Care Facility. In fact this movie could very easily be a After School Special movie from 1985 if not for the new millennium upgrade on all the kids/staffs troubles.

Being able to react calmly and find a way out of any situation is worth a lot, I know for myself... The film tells about the most important thing.

66,advaitkamat,The debut that'll be talked about years from now.,10,16 January 2014,"A compassionate, honest perusal of teenage angst, Short Term 12 lays new ground rules for independent cinema and, in the process, delivers one of the most poignant films of last year.I'm trying to put into words the bliss I'm beginning to feel as my mind shifts back to the film. From a tremendously funny opening sequence to an achingly sad second, the shift of mood is one for the ages. Cretton finesses his story into the hustle and bustle of an institution for underprivileged, sexually-abused teens, who are trying to find meaning in their futile existence. The institution is managed by Grace, a twenty-something young woman, with her simpatico boyfriend, Mason. Grace and Mason run it like a weekend party - they talk, jest, sing, dance and engage into water fights and occasional games of baseball. When one of the kids cusses or brawls, they are curt and stern.It's like having parents your age, you know. I don't see their relationship with the kids any other way.Grace lays the rules down to a newbie intern, ""Remember, you're not their parent. You're not their therapist. You're here to create a safe environment, and that's it."" Grace is conflicted. She's secretly pregnant, in love with Mason but she's too cloistered. She almost never talks about her thoughts on something, which miffs Mason though he understands.Mason is the guy everyone likes - kind, gentle, friendly and always funny. He tries to get Grace to talk to him, but she pushes him away. Not out of annoyance, but out of fear that she'll have to revisit her harrowing past.The arrival of a new girl, Jayden, changes a lot of things. Grace sees a younger version of herself in the dotty-mouth newcomer, and she's cautious. She wants to articulate her feelings to Jayden, who prefers to be alone, doodling. She doesn't take any crap from anyone, not even the dainty Grace, who wants to help her because she's lived through what the waspish Jayden's living through right now.Cretton handles the whole relationship delicately. Apart from providing sporadic comic reliefs, Jayden's character also provides a useful insight into the mindset of a neglected teen wanting to belong. Her inclination to claw herself to channel her inner rage is intelligible, and Cretton has observed it well. That's the kind of movie this is. It charms and ruffles you with its candid observations.But, you know, in all the teen flicks we've seen, the writer and director take liberties in knowing that it's a film after all. That's why these characters don't deal with situations pragmatically. And we enjoy watching what they do, but in some hidden nook of your mind, you'll say, ""That's never going to happen in real life. That's just sad.""The thing is, whatever happens in Short Term 12, is real life for you. It's pragmatic, familiar and relatable. You won't doubt the authenticity of the world Cretton creates for even a split second, because he's been there. Based on his real-life experiences, Cretton aptly creates palpable world that's way too real. So real, in fact, that it's overwhelming. And to get lost in it is a thing of pure joy.The film vastly benefits from a near-perfect script made better by fluid direction and fantastically naturalistic performances. Cretton's script is witty and sympathetic, jumping from laugh-out-loud funny to melancholic so neatly that you'll be surprised it's a work of a debutant. It's a nicely textured piece of writing that's meticulous and profound. His direction is sincere, impelling us to mull over his characters and their problems, and urging us to try and figure out what we would've done if we were in their place. And that's something rare, a film that not only involves us as an audience, but also involves us as human beings.The casting works brilliantly. Young Brie Larson, whom you might remember as Jonah Hill's cranky girlfriend in 21 Jump Street, is a major revelation. The emotional detail in her performance is exceptional for a relatively unseasoned actress. And she has that strong screen presence that young actresses generally do not have so early in their careers. She's sweet, tough, fiery and understanding. And she makes Grace a character I'll remember for a long, long time.Gallagher shines in a role that looks so easy to pull off but is actually pretty hard. Mason is as conflicted as Grace, and while she acts her emotions out rather than talk about them, he does the exact opposite. It's a difficult character to write and play, and Gallagher does well, really well.The rest of the cast doesn't let us down. It's a solid acting ensemble that shows us that good films need good actors, not stars who think they can improve on a good script.Short Term 12 was my favorite English-language film of last year, a film made at a measly budget of less than a million and yet managed to shame many of the biggies I saw. It's passionate filmmaking you don't get to watch very often, and a spirited wake-up call for the revival of independent cinema. A film that is so quiet, entirely devoid of violence and shticks, theatrics and boredom. A film that is emotive, gladdening, affectionate and empathic. A film that needs to be watched and cherished. A monumental achievement in itself.In a year of discoveries, I think we may have found the biggest one. Remarkable.",Short Term 12
67,LittleLotti,"Overrated, but still a good movie",6,6 May 2016,"I want to start off by saying I read quite a few reviews before watching Short Term 12 and going into the movie I thought for sure I was going to cry my eyes out and also get queasy from all the ""shakiness"" everyone complained about. After finishing the movie I was confused by those reviews. The camera is not shaky in the way documentary-style hand-held films are, it's just that the camera is never steady as if it were mounted on something. It distracted me at first, only because I was already expecting it. Also I didn't shed a single tear, which makes me wonder why this is listed as such a tearjerker. Don't get me wrong, it deals with heavy subject matter, and I've gone through enough traumatic experiences to relate to this movie, but I didn't find it ""heartwrenching"" as a few reviewers said. This is coming from someone who cries over everything. I cry at commercials, any slightly sad story or even happy ones. This just didn't affect me this way. I'm only relaying this so that someone who reads this before watching doesn't have the same expectations I did. As far as the film's story, I didn't find it to be anything groundbreaking. I'm truly shocked at the high rating on here. Unlike some users, I didn't find it slow or boring; I found it interesting and was drawn in within the first few minutes. I felt like there were some stereotypes played out here, but I guess one could argue that people can be pretty stereotypical. I feel like this was a good movie to showcase the kind of people we don't often see in films. Overall, I give this a 6/10 because it's not really a movie you enjoy in the sense that you want to see it again. It's one that you see once, appreciate and maybe discuss, but that's about it. It was kind of average to me. Definitely overrated, but I don't think that means it should be skipped.",Short Term 12
68,RichardvonLust,Hashtag SUPER YAWN,1,3 November 2015,"This has to be the most banal screenplay since 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' in 1956. Every single element of this production is main stream, manufactured, formulaic drivel. If you have a mind then please exercise it more by watching paint dry - it will be far more enthralling. The kids are not really kids but young adults trying to play them. The carers are also all young adults pretending to be mature. But genuine human reactions are either simply ignored or more probably not even understood by the cast or production team. For example in one scene, where a very disturbed adolescent is robbed of his treasured toys, the carers simply sit next to him and sympathize with words or a touch on the shoulder. He is plainly distressed but no one thinks of giving him a cuddle or a tickle to make him laugh or at least smile. It is as if real human care doesn't exist anymore - and had that been the them of the film it would have been more interesting. But as it is the film seems to project the media comfortable image that modern child care is entirely healthy and that all we need to do is tell the kids they can achieve anything they want in life given the right effort.

70,CharlieGreenCG,Rare independent gem of a film.,10,31 December 2013,"Being in charge of one dysfunctional child is often hard enough, being in charge of several is even harder. Destin Cretton's Short Term 12 captures this process wondrously. Whether it makes you cry at one scene, or to burst out laughing at the next. This film has it all.Grace (Brie Larson) is a serious young woman in her 20's, a supervisor at a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers. She's dedicated to her job, and also the kids in her charge – so much so that her relationship with long-term partner and co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) appears to be a secondary concern. Grace presents herself as a tough, no non- sense, yet compassionate figure, but when troubled Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) comes into care she starts to see her own problems reflected back at herself as buried secrets from the past being to emerge.Brie Larson, best known for minor roles in 21 Jump Street, and in this month's Don Jon, performs perfectly, so perfect in fact that an Oscar nomination buzz is already starting to surround it. We won't take any magic away from the film, but Brie jumps straight into the deeply challenging central role – dealing with everybody else's problems as well as all of her own. It's a roller-coaster experience that is heartfelt, emotional and simply tremendous.Destin Daniel Cretton's striking first feature is actually based off his own experiences, spending two years in a similar facility.

71,Ben_Cap,An underrated sleeper you don't want to miss.,8,5 February 2016,"There seem to be a lot of movies coming out in the past few years centering on young adults going through terrible hardships and learning a whole lot about life in the process. Short Term 12 aims to give the weary viewer a bit of a different look at this type of story. The movie centers around a group home and the at risk teens who reside there as well as the adults who work there who are not much older than the residents. What sounds like an emotional sob story is really a headfirst dive into the lives of these people and puts them is a light that is more about understanding and less about exploitation.The cast while not filled with well known names is extremely well rounded. These characters have to read as real people, and not as famous actors trying to make you forget that they were on Conan last night. For a group of relatively unknowns the realism achieved in these performances is impressive. The kids each feel like they are individuals while the adults have relate able insecurities of their own. The stand out performance here is from Brie Larson, who after this and the recent release of Room is becoming a top young actress. This was a role that she could have overplayed or taken the movie over, but she falls right into this one and takes a complicated character and puts a perfect performance on the screen.Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton is a name I had not heard of before this but I am sure this is not the last time I will. Movies like Short Term 12 have a problem where these characters that seem to have a perfect understanding of life and like to wax poetically about it for about an hour and a half. Short Term 12 is written to show that all of these characters are lost in some way. Even the people who are there to help these teens are not even close to having things figured out, but are trying their best, wish is all the world can really ask of you. As a director Cretton knows how to shoot an indie. It is a quiet movie that makes you feel as if you are there in the room with these characters. Instead of being filled with what I like to call ""emotional porn"" it tries to put the viewer in the shoes of the characters, rather than spending the movie feeling sorry for them.Short Term 12 is not an easy movie to watch for all the right reasons. It takes you out of your life for a bit and puts you into this world, where everything is not great, but as the movie goes on you will realize that you are not so different from some of these people. Everyone has problems, that you can guarantee, and Short Term 12 attempts to show that even if you think no one out there understands you or what is going on in your life, there is someone who knows what its like and they are more than likely willing to help. Movies should not be sad for the sake of being sad or uplifting for the sake of being uplifting. They should attempt to take the viewer and put them in someone else's shoes for two hours and let you feel emotions you may not otherwise feel in your daily life. Short Term 12 accomplishes this perfectly and hopefully will leave you with a better understanding of yourself.",Short Term 12

This movie captures the hermetic, strange, painful, troubling world of a residential institution for troubled youth. I have worked in a similar facility and I believe that this movie really nails the way in which a place like this becomes an entity all its own with its own rules and character and reality. Short term 12 is its own world and the people who reside there are simultaneously cut off from the outside world and attached by quirky and generally disappointing bonds to that outside world. This film also faithfully coveys the ways that a person who works in this type of setting is molded by the experience and bound to the peculiar world within the walls. The movie has humorous and absurd aspects but makes clear that many of the kids are there, to a great extent, because of the dismissiveness and callousness of the adults in their outside worlds who failed to nurture and protect the kids.",Short Term 12

76,BlueFairyBlog,Abuse Has An Advocate,8,19 November 2014,"The foster care system is the most flawed institution in the United States, which is disheartening as many of the children in said system deal with abuse, loneliness, and mental health issues. ""Short Term 12"" comprises everyday goings on of a facility for kids who live between homes and the street, and the workers who help them. At the crux of the film is Grace (Larson) who leads the facility's workers and helps kids while also dealing with her own life. It's really quite sweet that Grace and her boyfriend Mason (Gallagher) have fragmented childhoods, and so they have to (rather than want to) help ease the pain of these children and the problems they face. In comparison is a college worker who would like to help, but doesn't know where to start. The performances from the child actors in this film are nothing short of astounding. Brie Larson commands complete presence on screen, as Grace, a multi-faceted basket case who is always trying to do better, but inevitably has to fight her demons. This is a really sweet, funny, heartfelt film dealing with big issues in a sensitive and thoughtful way, which makes it highly recommendable.",Short Term 12

It is the story of a short term foster care facility for at risk teenagers, and deals mainly with one of the on floor supervisors named Grace. At first Grace seems to have everything well in hand, she is incredible at her job, interesting as a person and very easy to root for. Grace's life starts to get turned upside down when a string of occurrences, including the intake of a young troubled teen girl that reminds her of herself, begins to unravel feelings that she has been ignoring for years. The acting in Short Term 12 is completely incredible, every character from the small back ground roles to the main players are all completely believable, so much so that it sometimes feels like it could be a documentary. Saying that, this film is not going to fit everyone's tastes, there are no explosions or chase scenes, well, actually there are a few chase scenes, but not like anything you would see in a Hollywood movie. What Short Term 12 does have is heart, mounds and mounds of pure film lovers heart. So much so that when the last words were spoken and the credits rolled, all I could say to myself was, ""WOW!""

So far I've watched a full hour of the 90 minute movie and seriously I cannot name a single one of the characters.We have beardy guy who tells an opening tell of following an escaped kid off campus and then beardy poops himself on the bus. It gets interrupted by a kid trying to sprint off grounds.That is the high point of the long dull tale. No joke.Then we meet the kids (names not remembered at all). The story then drags on in a dreamy Jiggly Cam manner for 50 more minutes. We meet the black untalented rapper who mumbles (that's his entire characterization). We meet the self-cutter girl who has zero value to the story until an hour later when she tells a rip-off octopus & shark themed knockoff tale of ""The Giving Tree"". The main female staff character reveals she is pregnant with beardy guy's baby and has no value to the story for about 60 minutes into it and the camera follows her every dull minute of existence.These characters are shallower than beer coasters and less interesting than anything that you'd find written on a beer coaster.You can keep about 8 minutes of the movie start, cut out 50 minutes of the movie after that and lose nothing at all. It picks up at about 65 minutes in, but frankly I think any audience not watching this on Cable TV or the Internet has all walked away by now.

81,trvlers-77920,8.8/10,8,9 May 2015,"It all could have been painfully mawkish, populated as it is with the kinds of kids who provide inspiration for after-school specials. Instead, ""Short Term 12"" comes from a place of delicate and truthful understatement, which allows the humanity and decency of its characters—and, yes, the lessons—to shine through naturally. The film's originality begins with the setting: a foster-care center for at-risk teens whose troubles run the gamut from depression to substance abuse to self-mutilation. Writer- director Destin Daniel Cretton based ""Short Term 12"" partly on his own experiences working at such a center, and previously made a short film on the subject. In drawing the story out to feature length, Cretton takes an abidingly naturalistic, conversational approach to both the complicated issues these kids face and the no-nonsense way their counselors try to help them. Chief among them is Brie Larson as the twenty-something Grace, a formerly troubled teen herself who now hopes to serve as a guide for others. Just as the extent of Grace's painful past is revealed to us in deliberate pieces, Larson's performance itself is a revelation. It's a welcome and long-overdue lead role for the actress who's been so engaging in supporting parts in films like ""The Spectacular Now"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" and the Showtime series ""The United States of Tara."" There's a directness about her that's appealing, even here where she's meant to look a little mousy and low-key. At the film's start, Grace seems to have achieved a comfortable balance between her professional and personal lives. She handles both the mundane routine of the place and the volatile emotional flare-ups with the same sort of cool confidence. She also has a loving, playful relationship with her longtime live-in boyfriend, the shaggy, foulmouthed Mason (played amiably by John Gallagher Jr.), who works alongside her as a supervisor at the center. But the impending departure of one kid and the arrival of another shake everything up for her. Tough, intense Marcus (Keith Stanfield) is about to turn 18, which means he'll have to leave the home; frightened to make his way on his own, he acts out during these final days instead of facing his future. A profane and deeply felt rap song he wrote details his life of neglect and abuse, and the fact that Cretton presents the performance in one long take adds to its power. Marcus overlaps briefly with the surly and withdrawn new girl, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), who insists her father is coming to get her soon so she refuses to make friends. One of the subtle beauties of ""Short Term 12"" is the way it intimately depicts how the counselors find ways into these kids' lives and connect with them. For Grace and Jayden, it's through a shared love of drawing. But Jayden also uses her art to reveal the truth about her home life, which stirs secrets within Grace that she'd fought hard for years to suppress. This upheaval comes at a time when Grace and Mason are trying to create something lasting for themselves: a home and a family of their own. The ambivalence Grace finds herself feeling, and the way that emotional shift shatters Mason, are both believable and heartbreaking. Cretton shows as much care and kindness with the minutiae of the daily routine—the doling out of meds, searches for contraband and forced recreational activities like Wiffle ball games —as he does with the larger issues that plague these lives in flux. He also infuses his story with unexpected humor as the kids hassle each other—and their supervisors—on the road to healing. While some of the third-act choices his characters make seem a little extreme compared to the realism that marks the rest of the film, Cretton consistently refrains from employing a tone that's heavy-handed. ""Short Term 12"" is a small gem in which the uplift feels earned rather than preached.",Short Term 12

And even if you skip this, it still is prone to criticism negatively.The direction , meaning the camera angles and motions is fine ( i guess). Cinematography is Documentary -style , not very pleasant and entertaining. The script or plot or story , is indifferent, amateur , hipsterish , and weak. The lead actors aren't right for this kind of film , maybe cause they're too young. But the whole plot is just bad. A group home with a couple of troubled teenagers and a couple adults running the show. So what? The way the film develops , no development happens in a way to make you care for whatever you're watching. I didn't care about these people , and the things that happened to them. Instead of caring , i got bored and wanted this film to end. And i wouldn't be that harsh a critic if this movie had a lower rating. Maybe a 6.5 rating , which makes it decent and indifferent which is exactly what it is ( not that there aren't movies i find great with a 6.5 rating , just speaking of average) But lately the newer movies , get high ratings easily.

While I notice and applaud this film for the story it tells, I just didn't find it all that interesting. Many will probably disagree with me on this, but I simply could not stay engaged throughout this movie. I will say that the cinematic style and acting in this film are top notch. The ambience of this film is spot on for the content; ultimately, I was very impressed with the way this film was shot. The overall ""feel"" of this movie is anchored in realism; the shaky camera shots and lack of filters do a great job setting the tone for the bleak environment these characters live in. I applaud the director for portraying this world in a believable fashion. I will also say that the acting in ""Short Term 12"" is impressive overall. With memorable performances from Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr, the entire film feels very authentic in it's own right. The supporting cast does a fine job as well; Rami Malek contributes a solid performance as the new guy at the facility and helps set the tone with the rest of the cast.When it comes down to it, I just didn't find the story in ""Short Term 12"" very engaging. This is just my humble opinion and should not sway others from seeing this film, but I thought the script left much to be desired. In the midst of all the great acting and ambience, the story and script is ultimately what brings this movie down from greatness. While I did not enjoy the story (I fell asleep 3 times) I must give credit where credit is due. The acting, directing, and cinematography in ""Short Term 12"" are all top notch, delivering what I felt was an authentic experience despite my criticisms of the plot.

If a movie doesn't have the budget to distribute their film to a vast amount of cities or campaign well, then it is unlikely to get its deserved recognition. I sat through the 96 minutes of this Indie film that got raved with impressive reviews at SXSW to see what the fuss was about. The people behind this movie deserve SO much more praise than they have gotten. This film, though not technically masterful, is emotionally wrenching. I laughed, I freaking cried my heart out, and overall it felt real. There was a connection to the film that was surprisingly amazing. The movie reminded me to Blue is the Warmest Color in the sense that it was raw, powerful, real, and astonishing. Brie Larson should have easily been one of the five nominees for Best Actress as well as Keith Stanfield for Best Supporting Actor. This film is a portrayal of neglected youth, a rare look at relationships, an articulation of the fears in the world, and a new point of view that most films have never shown before.

Irrespective of the 'novelty' of the subject matter, clichés abound here. The whispered scenes to show 'sincerity' between the characters (when oh when will directors realize that no people - no people on Earth - speak that way in real life?). Long, lingering scenes of the principal character (I watched for the full 97 minutes and never even bothered to listen to find out whatever her name is) in the shower cleansing away 'the pain'. And an innumerable number of scenes where someone whispers, 'We really need to talk about this...' 'You have no idea what I'm going through right now...' 'I can't help you if you won't let me in...'

Just about every person, I've learned, has been in the exact same position I am in right now: faced with the decision of what to do with the rest of their life. So no, I'm not unique in my dilemma, I have ninety classmates in the exact same place I am, but I can surely tell you that it's as real as ever. So this week I am in New York City, taking a week long course at the New York Film Academy, hoping to learn something, have some fun, and most of all praying that I can answer some of these questions that loom over my head as I stand on the doorstep of life. I may return knowing what to do and who to be, I may not, but what I do know is that you're getting this instead of the review of ""The Expendables 3"" that you probably expected.As I began the second half of my junior year of highschool I decided I needed to begin thinking about what to do once I graduate. I have five siblings who had finished highschool by that time and so I was able to take a look at what they'd done to try to get an idea. What I observed is that they all followed they're passions: what they loved and what came naturally. One loved books as a kid: she became an English teacher. One was good at art: he's studying to be a graphic designer. Another was fascinated by the human body: she's headed for Medical School. So what's my passion? Easy, I love movies. . . Okay, well where do I go with that?About this time I stumbled upon Short Term 12. I hadn't heard that much about it, no one had. It was a little independent film that hadn't gotten much notice. It made big splashes at smaller awards shows and festivals, but otherwise it was completely unknown. But somehow it found its way onto my television and what I found when it finished was that I had just had a ninety minute emotional ride. I laughed more than I expected, I cried more than I care to confess, and I loved these fictional people more than I thought was even possible.Short Term 12 is a story about a twenty-something young woman named Grace. Grace works at a place called Short Term 12: a home for young teenagers whose home and family lives have become unsuitable and detrimental places for them to live. As can be expected, these kids have rough lives. Many have tried to harm themselves, most fall into extreme stages of depression, and yet amidst this all of them have found a couple of people they can call a really good friend: Grace, Mason, Nate, and Jessica. Grace and her co-workers aren't social workers, they don't have a certificate and they haven't gone to school for this, they're just the person who's there for the kids when they need it.I'm unable to describe with words the things that take place in the short ninety minutes that make up Short Term 12. The way director and writer Destin Daniel Cretton knows these kids and how they behave and react in such delicate situations makes the story so personal even when there is no other way for a person like me to relate to them. I never imagined a short children's story about an octopus could bring an ocean of tears to my eyes or that someone could find such personal value in something as simple as shaving your head. These kids have been forced to live awful lives, yet they still have those little things to give them hope. Even more amazing seen in the story is the character of Grace. Brie Larson's incredible mental performance is one that should be treasured forever, and one that makes you love the person that Grace is. Grace, along with Mason, Nate, and Jessica, is a good person doing an incredible thing. They're not going to be recognized for it, no one's going to give them a military medal or a sports trophy at the end of the movie, all they are going to have at the end of the day is the knowledge that they've done a great thing. And tomorrow morning, it's back to work. Every time I watch this movie I realize more and more how much good these people are doing. Sure they're fictional, sure they can put whatever they want onto a movie screen. But what makes this movie stand out from the rest is that it's real. Grace and Mason are so real. And it makes me jealous because they are such, in the most simplistic way, good people. I still don't know what I want to do as a career, but I do know what I want to do with my life. I want to be a good person. I give Short Term 12 a 9.6/10.",Short Term 12

I have to say, not only did it meet my expectations but it completely surpassed them.Short Term 12 is based on the 2008 short of the same name, which I have not seen. I knew roughly what to expect after watching the trailer, but I had the worry that perhaps the trailer showed too much of the movie and I wouldn't be as engaged as I possibly could. I needn't have worried at all, Short Term 12 is captivating and excellently written. Even with the short 96 minute run time, we get HUGE amounts of character development, more than many 150 minute movies have. The character building is so good that you feel as though you know these characters and enjoy hanging out with them.These complex characters would be nothing without good actors to play them, but thankfully the cast of Short Term 12 isn't just good, it's outstanding. There are some incredible supporting roles from very young actors like Keith Stanfield and Katylin Dever, both of whom's story lines are very genuine and well written. In the more major roles we have Rami Malek and John Gallagher Jr, who are both excellent in their roles, But of course, the star of the show is the incredible Brie Larson. Short Term 12 doesn't seem to be receiving much awards attention which is a shame, as Brie Larson deserves so much more recognition and every leading actress award there is. She delivers a stunning performance cementing her as one of the best actresses in the business, she gives a performance that's easily one of, if not the, best of 2013.Destin Cretton directs Short Term 12 and does a brilliant job of doing so. The cinematography is beautiful and there is so much raw emotion that the movie doesn't need to rely on sad music to make you feel emotional, it manages to do it with the incredible acting, writing and directing. Short Term 12 is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, it will make you feel sad, happy, depressed and uplifted. It's a true tour de force of cinema, and is my favourite movie of 2013.",Short Term 12

It is an emotional drama with a dark comedy tone to it, this film shows the difficulties and emotional rides these kids can be through, and also how these young supervisors not just sympathize with them but carrying about them and trying to make them feel better and have a brighter view to life, disregarding whatever happened to them. Besides the charming dialogue, the score gives a great mood to the film as well and makes it more enjoyable. Regarding the performances, everyone does a great job, you get a sense that this cast must have had a great time together because the chemistry among them is very strong, otherwise so many scenes wouldn't be emotional and effective to the audience, I should mention Kaitlyn Dever can have a bright future in acting, and John Gallagher Jr. is just an awesome story teller, otherwise the ending scene wouldn't be so charming.

Now my question is, all those years working with troubled kids, and this for some reason is the first girl she met that was sexually abused or self-harming and thus triggered her memories of her own abuse? Okay even ignoring that, maybe she just saw her younger self in the girl due to their slight resemblance but even then...This movie was very superficial. I kept waiting for them to delve deeper into the characters and their backstories but they never do. Grace finally reveals that her dad abused her at the end of the film and is now in jail, but that is as deep as the story gets. Also at one point Marcus mentions his mother hit him on the head, Grace is being abused by her dad (very vaguely talked about) and Grace's boyfriend was raised by foster parents. This paragraph is pretty much the entire movie's action summed up! Oh also the redhead kid is mentally ill and his therapist takes away his sister's dolls, leading him into a depression.As someone who is actually familiar with the institution they are depicting, there were much deeper and more interesting stories they could have told. They did not even scratch the surface. It was more like a ""feel-good"" story about making the best of a bad situation but I just couldn't get past the shallowness of it all. I gave it 6 stars to avoid being too harsh!",Short Term 12
95,TiagoRicardo,"""Short Term 12"" it's a ride filled with drama, joy and moving moments.",9,2 February 2014,"There are only a couple of movies that made me feel the way that ""Short Term 12"" did. This powerful and moving story takes place a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers where both kids and some elements of the staff had some rough moments in their childhood, being displaced from a parent or even abducted. Grace is a 20-something supervisor that works alongside with her longtime boyfriend, Mason. Grace always kept her problems away from everyone but with the arrival of a new girl, named Jayden, her life will never be the same again. While trying to help Jayden, Grace has to remind herself of the troubles that she had in her childhood and with the help of Mason and Jayden she will find the courage that she needs to face at last the problems that bother her for a long time. ""Short Term 12"" shows a reality that is unknown for a lot of people. It's about fighting for survival and about growing up. It was so wonderful to watch and I felt connected to the story right from the beginning. The acting was so amazing and I am still astonished about how great was to watch Grace dealing with her problems while she was helping Jayden. For those children, hope was almost gone and therefore the staff task was sometimes really hard to accomplish. Grace and Mason chemistry was one of the strongest points of the film, because the way that they solved their problems together gives a touch of romance that gives power to the story (""It's because you are the weirdest, most beautiful person that I've ever met in my whole entire life.""). ""Short Term 12"" it's a another proof of the great quality of indie movies and it reaches your heart with this moving and touching story. Because sometimes, when you think there is no hope left for you, you just have to keep fighting for your life. ""Short Term 12"" it's a ride filled with drama, joy and moving moments.",Short Term 12
96,sfworthington,Exceptionally raw,8,10 January 2021,"A pretty contained film that deeply delves into its subject matter in a nuanced and highly effective way. What makes Short Term 12 pretty damn special though is it's lack of exposition. Despite the story not straying far from one place and the characters we are presented with, a lot of guess work and suggested information. This isn't a sign of sloppy film-making however, it's actually genius. Not exactly a coming of age but a coming of character. Every character seems to symbolise something in the story and everybody learns something and therefore grows from it, meaning the audience gain a multitude of knowledge and opportunity for emotional connection. Connecting emotionally is not a challenge with this film, you'd have to be a psychopath to not feel empathy or understanding towards every character we meet.
It's a film where every moment captured speaks for itself, it's subtle and simplistic yet speaks a tremendous amount of volume to not just its subject matter but to what it is to be a human who feels, everyone can take something from this film in some way, big or small. I have to take a moment to appreciate the technical film-making as it too is so simple yet so effective, there are moments (especially the ending) that genuinely feel like poetry in motion.",Short Term 12

Again well made, just not my cup of tea.",Short Term 12
98,Emma_Stewart,Short Term 12 feels like home,10,7 January 2014,"Short Term 12 opens with a story that lets us know immediately how irrational and threatening the charges at the titular care facility can be, how scary the job is, and how bleak prospects are for children upon leaving the facility. It sets itself up perfectly to be a Hilary Swank save-the-kids vehicle filled to the brim with plenty of crying scenes, lives changing for the better, and other assorted white savior nonsense. But instead, the film unfolds delicately and organically, never playing up the drama or belittling its characters or ingratiating the audience; director Destin Cretton has crafted a marvelously intimate and observant masterpiece that reaffirms what a powerfully emotional and cathartic medium cinema can be when filmmakers eschew cheap tricks in favor of intelligent, realistic and heartfelt storytelling.First-day employee Nate (Rami Malek) is our window into the isolated, fascinating world of Short Term 12, a home where at-risk adolescents can stay for up to a year - though some, like soon to be released Marcus (Keith Stanfield), have been there much longer. Jessica (Stephanie Beatriz) and secret couple Grace and Mason (Brie Larson and John Gallagher, Jr.) round out the line staff, who are instructed not to play the role of therapist but merely to maintain a safe environment for their charges and keep them in check. A new arrival (Kaitlyn Dever) shakes things up both at the facility and in Grace's personal life as her familiar battle scars threaten to dredge up events in Grace's past that she would rather not confront.Larson is unrecognizable here. She comes across much older than her 23 years, weighed down by the weary maturity of a girl who grew up too fast. As compassionate and sisterly as Grace is with her charges, Larson's deadened eyes and perennial half-smile suggest hidden darkness and pain that she slowly and surgically reveals at exactly the right moments. But the greatest strength of her performance is the way she executes her explosive arc flawlessly while never stealing attention away from her costars. John Gallagher, Jr., Keith Stanfield and Kaitlyn Dever are assigned the stock roles of nice guy, rebellious black kid and sultry goth girl but all do so much to add layer upon layer to their characters until they are as complex and well-defined as Grace is. Stanfield and Dever in particular are revelations, delivering the film's most heartbreaking moments in the form of a violently angry rap and a disturbingly metaphoric children's story. Larson is at the center of all this, but the beauty of her performance is that no matter how much Grace is struggling in these scenes, she never draws the focus to herself and blends quietly and perfectly into the ensemble. There are plenty of high-emotion and high-volume scenes like Dever and Stanfield's respective breakdowns, but Cretton weaves the film with a steady hand and a level head - it never gets overwhelming and in spite of some questionable plot developments in the third act he maintains a measured state of earthy normalcy. His even direction, coupled with the natural performances and a shrewd, quiet sense of humor in the writing about the characters' hysterics and interactions, take what could have been overcooked to the point of after-school special melodrama and make it play out like a regular day in the life of these characters. Montages of the kids' day-to-day activities, throwaway shots of people sitting or playing together, wards looking at their birthday cards or redecorating their bedrooms - it's the simple things that carry the most meaning, and that cumulatively make Short Term 12 feel very much like home.",Short Term 12

100,meeshoffmanns,A very Intimate and Heartbreaking Look into the Lives of People who have been Damaged.,9,20 March 2019,"This movie immediately drew my attention when I read the summary. My own mother has worked in a similar institute, and I was always curious how one keeps up with those situations on a day-to-day basis. When I finished watching, I was in awe. This movie is very powerful and full of love and heartbreak, and deserves a very high amount of praise.Acting:
Brie Larson always has been a tough actress for me to judge. She can be incredibly subtle and professional with the right role, but also very flat and stoic with the wrong one. This is one of the better ones. It is not uncommon for coworkers at such an institute to have come from a similar background as the kids they are looking after, and the more the movie progresses, the more you want to find out what happened to this young woman. How does one who is so full of compassion and understanding and wisdom unable and afraid to open up about herself and follow her own lessons in life? Brie sells every likable aspect about this character excellently, and convinces you just how much respect these kind of people deserve for doing their job right.John Gallager Jr is even better; not necessarily in terms of acting, but his character is an absolute joy to watch. He radiates professionalism, friendliness, warmth and love all at once, while not being perfect all the same. John himself does a terrific job at giving life to all these aspects, and watching him interact with Brie is wonderful.Katlyn Denver as Jayden is a gem. While she carries often the same sullen expression in a lot of her roles, this character fits that attitude perfectly. Once you slowy discover what she struggles with everyday, you feel a great amount of empathy for her, and when this gets the better of her, it is absolutely heartbreaking to watch and a testament of the talent of this young woman.Lakeith Steinfeld as Marcus is another excellent choice. The young actor has a cold armor around him all the time, radiating stoicness and absolute rage and
impotence all at once. Just like Jayden, his background is very moving and sad, and he gets a lot of moments that truly hit the hammer on the nail for what this movie wants to convey to us.As for Rami Malek, his role feels a bit unnecessary, as he is mostly used to represent the audience who feel absolutely baffled an shocked at the events that occur in the treatment center on a day to day basis. He does a reasonable job, and at the end of the movie, he integrates fairly well. I just think that you could have given him slightly more screentime to watch that integration really blossom.Direction:
Knowing that Destin Daniel Cretton actually has experience in the care of abused children, explains a lot regarding why this movie works so well. He knows exactly how to show the pain and psychological damage without saying anything, choosing to follow every character very closely and using very natural and heartfelt dialogue. He created nothing short of a masterpiece here.Cinematography:
The colour choices for this movie are interesting. Even at the toughest and gutwrenching scenes, the overal picture looks nice and warm and yellow. It reflects in a certain way the kind of environment that the workers want to create for the kids. Outside the treatment center, where help is less easily accessed, and the characters must figure out their problems themselves, grey tones and dark shadows are used. Handheld camera is preferred here over steadycam, to make you feel like you are in the same room with these characters when they are at their most vulnerable, and it works incredibly well. Sometimes you really feel like you are invading their moment and that you need to leave.Plot:
Some people critisized this movie for being little more than a series of moments inside the life of this treatment center, but while not entirely true, it is also kind of the point. It shows a lot of variety in terms of the problems each kid and their helpers are dealing with, adding a lot of human element to it. At the same time, we follow Grace and Mason outside of their work in their own problems and relationships, and how some of it translates itself to their work and vice versa. It never drags or becomes less engaging, only more compelling. The first and last scene are particulary well written in a way that makes everything come full circle.Editing:
While not that special, the pacing works remarkibly well in this movie thanks to the editing, and some scene transitions between strong emotional moments and a lighter tone work very well.Tone:
As previously mentioned, the approach is very human and intimate, both warm and extremely bone-chilling. How the movie can switch between these tones expertly is amazing, and nothing feels out of place. You get attached to every character and the compassion and warmth that they exert, while at the same time not losing sight of the horrible problems and tragedy that they deal with every day.Overall Concensus:
This movie is one of the most gripping and compelling experiences I have ever had. A lot of people can relate to the themes and topics in this, and the direction ensures that you are engaged as much as possible to what is happening. A short and intimate masterpiece, 8.8/10",Short Term 12

About life, circumstances & what obstacles kids might have to overcome & endure at a criminally young age for such tragedy. So overall, powerful stuff to reflect on. Will also have you empathetical & counting your own particular blessings. Or so I hope. I can't think of one false note, honestly, and it packs a punch all the while being very understated & realistic (I have worked with at-risk youth). SPOILER ahead..... My husband's ONLY complaint (and can't get more minor than this) is a CAR alarm would go off or neighbors alerted during that one scene. (OK, that can't be TOO great a spoiler in & of itself but taking NO chances). I think everyone should see this. I know I've spread the word.

102,arseniy,Either Exceptional Or Exceptionally Irresponsible,8,26 March 2016,"Awesome in every way, but potentially one. And it's a huge one, which I'd very much like to be wrong about. From my experience, when you house a bunch of kids together (any kids, but especially kid with serious parent issues, some as old as 17) - it doesn't take long for things to descend into some real Lord Of The Flies territory. And often. I.e. For them to spend a hefty portion of their overflowing, youthful energy and creativity - straight torturing each other. The corresponding bureaucracy too, having a selection effect where people who genuinely, objectively care - get unceremoniously weeded out. I'll trust for now that the guys who made this film know something I don't, but if this representation of what a ""taken away"" kid is likely to encounter in such an institution is an uncharacteristically rosied one - I'd have to call this film extremely irresponsible. Because if not doing ones due diligence here, is likely to result in even one kid getting over-hastily thrown into what I suspect to be much more of a meat grinder - that would absolutely mangle all of this film's ample strengths.",Short Term 12
103,therapynic-166-866320,My absolute favorite film,10,14 August 2021,"Terrific performances from Brie Larson and. Lakeith Stanfield before they were household names, a story that is both heartbreaking and tremendously uplifting, characters that are so uniquely multi-dimensional, a script that delivers laughs and tears and introspection...what else is there to ask for?The film follows a group of behavioral halfway house counselors (and the kids and teenagers they look after) as they advocate and care for these children when they may or may not have support from their families, therapists, or each other - as well as lives lives of their own. It starts on one counselor's first day as he listens to a funny story from a tenured counselor about a former kid they looked after. In what quickly becomes standard for the plot, the story is interrupted by one child who makes a run for the gates, hoping to escape the center. The counselors rush to catch him, and hold him down as he gets his frustration out, at which point the tenured counselor finishes his story, which ends rather unfortunately in the death of the child who was the subject of the story.The film continues this pattern in an organic way that mimics life itself rather beautifully: things become happy, then sad, then the happy thing you thought was going to end well sometimes does and sometimes doesn't, the message being you have to live for the beautiful moments because life is full of crap sometimes.You might think ""Wow this sounds preachy and cheesy"" and I don't think you'd be wrong. But where this film really makes it worth it is the performances, range of realistic characters, and the way it just makes you feel right. I watch it early morning every Christmas. Highly recommend.",Short Term 12
104,frenchjuice,Simple beauty,8,15 September 2015,"I realized that I loved this film when in the end when I felt happy for a character, and not just ""aww"" happy but a genuine happiness that you feel when you are with your loved ones. In the span of an hour and thirty minutes the movie made me connect to a character like he was a real person. Short Term 12 achieves this by underplaying everything. There are no spectacular shots, memorable lines, nor an actor that ""steals"" scenes, nothing in this film shouts ""look at me! I am important!"". Short Term 12 is the film that was stripped of anything flashy to just show the audience character relationships. Characters are introduced to a new environment, hearts get broken, and tears are shed. These are the epitome of tear jerker clichés, however the audiences are not tricked into crying like the usual Hollywood films but gets comforted by the movie and how it all plays out. By stripping of everything but the characters, the director Destin Daniel Cretton focuses on the only the necessary elements to the film. The result is a warm and heart warming tale that's not necessarily a ""feel good"" movie. This is not the best movie ever, this was not aiming to be the best movie ever, but if you see this movie you will just lie down and enjoy it.",Short Term 12

Don't they have a heart or feel empathy?This film is incredibly moving. It feels like a documentary. It moves slowly but at the same time nothing feels forced. I totally feel for the main characters and even cried once. If anything the emotions are sort of downplayed and not forced on us.I hardly noticed the shaky cam, it definitely did not reduce my enjoyment of the film. It sort of amplified the low budget feel of the film. Actually much of the cinematography is quite lovely. It gives you that fly on the wall feeling where you are observing but not really judging.I suspect that some of the people that ripped the film apart are effected by the subject matter. They may have feelings of abandonment or not feeling loved growing up that they haven't dealt with. Being part of the foster care system must be very painful in itself. As must be having been sexually abused or feeling suicidal and not ever getting to deal with it. Short Term 12 is an important film. It brings up a lot of issues that cause us pain in our youth as well as when we grow into adults. The stories of the residents were more interesting to me then the counselors however.

109,jaymcguinness,Great Acting in an absorbing drama,7,28 November 2018,"Short Term 12 is a powerful and moving drama that leaves you with warm feelings on conclusion. It depicts the personal struggles of a group of teenagers in supported care and their carers.Dramas of this sort can sometimes leave you feeling gloomy and have a depressing feel. It certainly has dark moments of personal struggle, dealing in mental health, domestic abuse, self harm and suicide but the standard of acting and ending of the movie most definitely leave you feeling positive.What stands out most about this film however is the cast. There are several strong performances even from the supporting cast with minor screen time.
Brie Larson in the lead role excels. A breakout performance in a slow moving drama. One particular scene that comes to mind is the scene with Frantz Turner playing Jack. The outburst is a culmination of her protecting Jayden (played very well by Kaitlyn Dever) who she has begun to understand
and create a close bond with, along with her own personal life frustrations. It is Jayden and not her boyfriend, despite his attempts, who allow Grace to open
up and deal with her own personal struggles and her past.
John Gallagher Jnr, who I had not seen much of prior to this movie also puts in an understated performance as the caring and supporting boyfriend and provides a few moments of comedic relief throughout the drama. I should also mention his scene at his foster family birthday celebration. The scene is only short but the emotion he displays in saying thank you to his foster parents was powerful.
This is also one of the early roles for Rami Malek, who has now gone on like Brie to much more significant roles. He doesn't have much screen time
in this and no particular scenes of note.
Other than Brie however I believe Lakeith Stanfield as Marcus puts in the best performance. His backstory doesn't get as much time as Jayden and it is
less central to the plot of the film which is mainly the Grace/Jayden/Mason arc, but all of his scenes are very strong and he is very believable.",Short Term 12

When it comes to film as an art form, escapism is thought of. The quality of Short Term 12 does make us involved to a point of escapism yet we cannot evade how real the piece is. The screenplay, the acting, the cinematography, direction, editing etc. make us observe such issues realistically. Issues that we may be aware of but not on such a personal level. Cretton was inspired to write Short Term 12 based on his own experience of working in a group facility for teenagers. This, in line with the superb performances on and off screen, gave the film a realness that is rare. Many directors don't write the films that they direct. Many that do create a fictional premise. With ST12, Cretton uses first hand experience and it translates impeccably. His writing is excellent, and evokes a platform for the actors. The acting is spectacular. It's not a film that announces at any point that it's based on real life/true events. It doesn't need the audience to consider this because of its rawness.",Short Term 12
112,richardosborne14,"""...a well crafted drama, whose realness, openness and immediacy you will fall in love with at once.""",10,3 October 2013,"Deeply dark, but edged with comedy. Difficult to watch but so rewarding at the same time. Short Term 12 not only shows the events inside a group foster home, but really captures what it might feel like to be there. Watching Destin Daniel Cretton's film brings out the same emotions, if only for a shorter period of time, as you would experience if you were in the position of the workers in the home. Focusing on Grace (Brie Larson) who is head of the line staff in the home, and her troubles both inside and outside of it, the film at once grabs you and does not let go until the end of this haunting but humorous journey of healing, learning and discovery.The film, of course, is written with personal experience seeping through every scene. Cretton spent two years in the staff of such a home, and when his short film entailing his encounters there went down so well at Sundance, the logical step was to allow it to blossom into a feature length script. Cretton is a very talented writer. At the instant it feels like an opportunity might have been overlooked, he brings out something even better, something not only logical but inevitable, keeping us on our toes the whole time. If it ever feels predictable, it doesn't stay this way for long, with the direction of the scene being thrust from left to right, from comedy to catastrophe. At times is it a true example of textbook storytelling, but at no point does it tire or feel previously well trodden. On the contrary it is fresh and explorative in a way that I have not seen before. Opening on a new member of staff's first day, we are immediately invited into the home and the story, and before we know it we care about all of the children and our co- workers. Larson, in a role that has allowed her to show her full capabilities and that will no doubt make her a star, is excellent as Grace who, on the arrival of a new girl, Jayden, realises that maybe it is herself that is the most troubled child in the home after all. This simply allows for some beautiful scenes between Grace and her loved-up boyfriend and co-worker Mason (played by the equally brilliant John Gallagher Jr.) in a story that otherwise may have lost direction getting outside of the foster home had it been handled by somebody else. Also worth note are Kaitlin Dever (Jayden) and Keith Standfield as Marcus, the two teens we learn the most about.The film is shot with a hand held style and mostly with close ups, which helps us engage and feel part of the anecdotes, tragedies and celebrations straight away, and with a delicate score that can lift the mood and bring it right back down in an instant, the elements of the film work well together and are confidently handled to create a well crafted drama, whose realness, openness and immediacy you will fall in love with at once. This is a film whose success will hopefully not end at South By South West where it won a number of prizes, but should see a lot more buzz around it as we enter the awards season.",Short Term 12

Fighting their own demons, Grace (Brie Larson) with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher) and the rest of the staff, try to make the days of the children inside Short Term 12 a little, or sufficiently, less hard to live. With so much stories in there and heartwarming characters, I got a ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" vibe. Its theme is a very tough one, there is no easy way to talk about it, but we are presented a very subtle road into troubled children's life; without being explicit, Destin Daniel Cretton lets us contact with them.Life is never vacuous of tragedy, in fact it may look like it's filled with it; but even the worst of all disgraces could lead into something beautiful.

Grace ( Brie Larson) is a troubled young woman . A woman for whom life has not been easy . She chooses to not hide from that pain but to embrace it , I think without even realizing it , by working and loving other people that are also troubled. Her job as little boss of the Short Term 12 center has her face to face with realities of life. Her relationship with another worker Mason ( John Gallagher Jr) who was also a foster child also runs in that "" hiding in plain sight"" pattern.

Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr were terrific! The problems and the situations were a bit out there, but you know that stuff like that probably happens. I thought it was raw, real, and sharp. The emotions that arose in me while watching this were really overwhelming at times and I also thought the children played their roles really well. I tried to find something that I didn't like about this movie but I honestly couldn't. This definitely should have been up for some academy's/golden globes and I was really surprised that it wasn't even nominated. I know that it killed in the festivals, but wow. Just a great movie.

Everything about this movie is what makes it great. The acting feels so real, the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is nice, the tone is wonderful and it's overall really heartfelt. Although this film can get a little depressing at times it lightens us back up with its great humor. Overall Short Term 12 is one of my favorite movies of 2013 and now stands to be one of my favorites in recent years as well. I highly recommend people to check this movie out.",Short Term 12
122,bschiranth,Very underrated!,8,7 September 2014,"This was a seriously refreshing movie to watch.Sad thing is,No one I met has seen or even heard about it.Blame it on poor marketing.This movie is about the teenagers of a foster-care facility and the caretakers themselves. How they affect each other and themselves in the process can be seen here. Brie Larson is just terrific in this. Perhaps her best performance yet.Another standout is Kaitlyn Denver.She is young and talented and plays the role of a troubled teenager.All the kids and teenagers were interesting. The chemistry between them is clearly visible especially between Brie and Kaitlyn. Every character undergoes through mental stress in this film and its a treat to watch them tackle it and come out stronger than before.""What doesn't kill you make you stronger "" literally ; applies here .The Rap song scene was truly great and is still fresh in my mind months after seeing this.In the end, you will feel good about life after watching this.

123,erikamikacic,A powerful movie,8,15 April 2016,"Short Term 12 did a great job of encompassing everything in its hour and thirty minutes of runtime. I didn't feel like anything was left out, nor unnecessary. There were details and close ups of how time passes in the facility, as well as outbursts. It shows how the workers manage to keep their calm throughout chaos, how much will and persistence they have in helping those teenagers; how accustomed they've grown to it. The workers went through similar things as some of the teenagers there, so they know how horrifying that is. That's why they're helping them and providing them with a safe place to be. A lot of the teenagers aren't just saddened and willing to accept help - they lash out at others and themselves. They're filled with rage and confusion because of being raised in households where there was violence and abuse. They associate love to manipulation. They developed illnesses because of it. It makes me so sad that people are cruel to children. The workers are very compassionate towards the teenagers, they don't force anything onto them, try to make them happy or ""fix"" them. They're simply there for them, they keep things in order and provide them care. Thats's something every young person needs and deserves. The movie shows how Grace is still recovering from her adolescence and coping with it. She has trust issues with Mason and her pregnancy brings negative associations from the past with it. Her dad is coming out of prison in a week. She empathizes with the teenagers, especially the new girl who comes into the facility. Lots of the teenagers are very talented and artistic. When the new girl read a children's story to Grace, I was struck with grief. My eyes filled with tears numerous times throughout the movie. I'm glad the beginning and end have great and funny stories. The relationship between Grace and Mason is really nice, and intimate. Overall, the ambiance is quiet but powerful and it's a very significant topic. I'd recommend this movie to everyone. It'll shake you up or if anything, it'll show you the world of teenagers who have experienced abuse and their treatment. And I'm guessing those who have experienced such things will be able to resonate with it. (I watched it because I saw that someone who has, loves it.)",Short Term 12

It makes you look at everything through other lenses. It is not like a sad or happy ending, it is just a real ending.I was convinced that I had seen everything about reality in movies with other directors. I was clearly wrong, I don't know if it's been a long-shot by the director or he knows what he is doing, but I'm definitely going to watch everything he has done and it is going to do from now on.Everything is perfect, the supporting role(boyfriend) is like a Paul Rudd on gamma rays and becoming the Hulk of acting.

It has a beautiful story with real characters that you forget for a moment that you're watching a movie and hold your breath during every moment. I give a lot of credit to the filmmakers behind this masterpiece simply because they kept a perfect pace throughout the film and consistently left me, a frequent film-goer, surprised. It had a beautiful score but it was never used to convey the mood in scenes. The filmmakers just showed what happened but left it up the audience to interpret moments which is great for any film to do that because it's not telling us how to think, but letting us think for ourselves. Every character was flawed and real, even the minor characters were given a chance to shine. The only gripe I had with the film was the poor cinematography with blown out whites (especially in the indoor to outdoor shots), grainy footage, and odd out of focus shots. Yet, the poor cinematography worked towards the film's advantage because of the topic of dealing with troubled youth. Overall, it had great acting, great direction, and a great story.

In the hands of a lesser writer/director this could have been a stodgy, depressing, cliché-ridden mess however Destin Cretton has created a wonderfully fresh, honest, heart breaking & funny gem of a movie.The entire cast are flawless but special mentions must go to Brie Larson (sensational), Peter Gallagher Jr, Lakeith Lee Stanford and Kaitlyn Dever.Short Term 12 deserves much wider recognition simply because it's a rare thing... a film with a sublime script, great direction, terrific performances and above all heart & passion.

131,james_sex09,A good film after a Long Term,8,26 December 2014,"A modernistic cinema, which bases its grounds on simple human problems while the background is quite unique and real. It is a film of our time and era, having the intricacies of any great film attached to it.The film opens up with a scene having really high imaginative impact where Mason is describing an incident of how he shitted in his pants. Then, you are hit with another surprise element about where are they and what they do. This a language of filmmaking which has been long forgotten.Though it is not a mystery or suspense thriller, the lesser you know about the plot, the more chance you give the director to achieve what he wants to, with the audience. The thing I loved the most about the film is that it isn't centered around only one character. Because of this, you can feel why Grace is doing what she is doing and how Mason feels hurt or what the story of Octopus of Jayden means.The only downfall I felt in the film was absence of deep characterization. Of course, the character didn't do anything that was illogical or seemed pretentious (they behaved like real people would in circumstances like that), but the 'deep characterization' like in Jagten (The Hunt) could have set it apart.It was lovely film to enjoy and engage you throughout its running time, however, it gives you nothing to think about after it is over (you can say it loses you after the ending).Thank you for reading.",Short Term 12

Maybe this is to be expected of a low-budget film - probably using amateur actors - but the lead parts appear to have been given to professionally-trained actors who have not troubled to learn to speak properly!I rate the film 2 instead of 1 out of 10 as visually it looked as though the actors are convincing in their roles. Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher) looked to to be well-cast, and the chemistry between them was apparent. But I'm not going to waste my time guessing at a plot when the actors mumble or garble their lines.

The movie revolves around a care unit for at-risk teens and their lives, what they've gone through, their everyday struggles and challenges they have to overcome.
What makes this movie so special is its whole calm yet destructive atmosphere and its authenticity, it has an admirable cast specially Brie Larson in the lead, and the cinematography gives a deeper level to this journey of emotions.

This is a truly special film and was definitely the big WOW moment of the entire festival. The film won the Grand Jury and Audience Award for Narrative feature and it deserves the accolades 100%. The acting in this film is so honest and real that I felt like I was watching a documentary at times. This is easily a star making role for Brie Larson, John Gallager Jr., and Kaitlyn Dever. All are young stars on the rise and I hope this film helps progress their careers in the right direction, because they all deserve it.The film tells the story of Grace (Larson) and her coworkers as they work at a dysfunctional foster care facility. There are many characters in the film, specifically the kids in the foster care, and each and every character with a speaking role is a completely fleshed out, multi- dimensional character. It was easy to connect with every character since you really felt for their difficult life situation and it was riveting to see these characters interact with each other in a realistic way.I don't want to say too much about the film, but there are some very moving scenes that definitely made me tear up. This is a very emotional film and you could feel the passion that was put into it by the cast and filmmakers. I believe wholeheartedly that this movie deserves Oscar buzz, specifically in Screenplay and some of the acting categories. The audience reaction as the credits rolled was one of the warmest receptions at SXSW that I experienced this year and multiple people gave it a standing ovation.I cannot wait to see this film again, definitely the best of the festival and one of the best first features by a director that I've ever seen. This is going to be a very important film in 2013 and I cannot wait to see what is in store for the film, the director, and these talented young rising actors.

I had read enough about it to understand that it would be a movie suited for me, so I had quite high hopes for this one. And oh boy did it surpass those expectations and then some. I love how it just jumps in to the world within Short Term 12, without necessarily introducing a potential plot or the characters. And it does this so natural, and continues to be this natural throughout the whole film. The cinematography is beautiful, with a fully realistic feeling to it, and every shot is as wonderful as the other, and true to the storyline. It almost has a documentary feeling to it. The screenplay and story is so well written and natural, and no dialogue bit feels strained. But mostly this is a character driven film, with each part driven by amazing acting. They are all so believable, as is the whole film, and as an audience you can really feel with every single one of them, through hardships and happiness. Brie Larson is a total revelation, acting well worthy of an Oscar (or at least nomination). John Gallagher Jr, Kaitlyn Dever and Keith Stanfield alongside the rest of the supporting cast does beautiful work with their great characters. Together with Ryan Coogler's Fruitvale Station (with whom it shares some aesthetics) this was the most gripping and beautiful film of 2013. And it's a shame neither one of these films got the recognition they deserved. Among others, especially Larson deserved a nomination, and the song performed by Keith Stanfield's character Marcus (one of the absolute best scenes of the film). But still, I'm happy they are being made, and hopefully these smaller and amazing movies can get the same attention as the bigger studio produced ones.This is a film that both takes your heart and throws it on the ground, but also one that lovingly caress it. To sum it up, I love it!",Short Term 12

I can assure you that you've never seen it done this well. While most films dealing with abused children try to over explain the characters, this one does not. It gives you just enough to look at the screen and see people instead of characters. It's really hard to explain the emotions this movie made me feel without ruining it for you. If anything, watch it for an extremely powerful performance from Brie Larson. She's going to be a huge deal in just a few short years.

145,zndouglass,Most underrated indie film of 2013,9,30 September 2014,"Writer-director Destin Cretton's Short Term 12 is an intimate look into the life of a young woman named Grace, a mature, independent , and damaged caretaker at a juvenile foster housing facility. From first shot to last, the film is stunning; it is beautifully shot and incredibly acted.Short Term 12's plot lends itself to intimacy. What is so wonderful about this film is that we get to meet and follow more than one resident's story. This isn't a plot overdrive, everything adds up and flows perfectly. Prior to becoming a film student, Crettom worked at a place such like the one shown in Short Term 12. This shows through his material and ability to bring together multiple stories with such fluency and emotional impact. He ensures his characters are worthy of love and attention, and the actors bring this script to life perfectly. Relatively unknowns in the film industry, Kaitlyn Dever and Keith Stienfield equally give wonderful portrays of their characters Jayden and Mason, respectively. Jayden and Mason aren't poorly written, clichéd, teenagers — they are well written and developed characters that are believable.Cretton, along with his screen writing, has an amazing and unique talent for directing. Each scene is clearly well thought out and captivating. If it weren't for Spike Jonze's Her and Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, Short Term 12 easily could have been the movie to beat at the 2014 Academy Awards",Short Term 12

These are the things that I see kids deal with on a daily basis. So many of our ""throw away kids"" aren't throw away at all, its just their parents are pieces of *insert your favorite curse here* and the children get thrown by the wayside.Grace (Brie Larson) does a phenomenal job of portraying a woman who cares almost too much for her kids to her own detriment, while dealing with her own inner demons. Mason (John Gallagher) does a wonderful job of playing the balancing role. Hes sweet, kind, but has a limit of his own.

148,meganhintz-951-591924,Painfully Accurate,9,28 March 2016,"I've read some of the negative reviews and felt compelled to give my own opinion. While this may not be cinematic genius, the story here is real. This is what group homes look like.I did this job for years. I've worked in several group homes and been a social worker for 10 years. I've been interested in helping ""the underprivileged"" since I was a small child myself. This interest has made me view almost every film I could come across dealing with social workers or underprivileged teens/adults. This is, BY FAR, the most accurate adaptation I have seen to date. The way the children blow up unexpectedly and have to be ""restrained"" is a day to day (if not hour to hour) occurrence in these settings. I remember my first summer, at age 19, chasing a child down the street for hours because it's true, you can't keep them there, they aren't prisoners. But you ARE supposed to maintain a safe environment. So them leaving, is not safe. So you chase them, and try to reason with them. Getting spit on? If that's the worst thing that happens to you, it's a good day. The scene where Grace blows up at her boss for not taking her report of child abuse on a resident seriously? It is ALL too real, and made my stomach hurt to watch. I could write for hours about the things that have happened working in places like this, but that's not the point.This film shows what working in a place like this is like. For the kids, and for the all too naive employees. I don't think this is meant to be a cinematic masterpiece, but it shows something very real. I hope this gives a GLIMPSE of what social workers give there lives for on a daily basis.I only take away from a 10 rating because I feel the development of relationships was rushed. In reality, you would never disclose your own abuse to a client, especially so early on, and teenagers of abuse don't tend to be very receptive to ANY authority figures, especially after only a few days. Regardless, it still is the best representation of this kind of work that I have seen so far, and for that, I am appreciative!",Short Term 12

Brie Larson is fantastic as a mentor to troubled kids, even though she has many internal problems of her own. There was something about the amateur yet great cast that was very enticing. Short Term 12 is a little too rough to be a sappy everything works out in the end movie. The music blends the story together incredibly well.

Like they did not believe we would get the character's personalities unless they were beaten into us. Critics applauded movie largely for its the frank portrayal of the marginalized lives of kids in the limbo of foster care, group homes, and other living situations. I agree that they were humanized here very well. The sad was really sad (which seems consistent with the setting), but for all its supposed grittiness and realism, the sweet was a little too sweet.

Subtle, incredibly deep, and full of unsentimental heart and compassion. It's about people who have been damaged by the people who are supposed to protect them the most: their parents. And it's not just about that. It's about how the human spirit can, with care and respect, somehow sustain after such darkness. It's about real love.This film is why I go to the movies. This film is why I've made my livelihood movies. Bravo Mr. Cretton and everyone involved with the film. I wish you nothing but the best.",Short Term 12
158,Ronaldo_arb,Fantastic underrated movie with a solid Brie Larson performance,10,31 January 2014,"This movie is hands down one of the best movies of the year , a very powerful heartwarming writing and a great acting that makes this movie easily one of the best. The story is based on true facts that really can happen in this world to show us how hard the life can be. and the performance Brie Larson did in this movie is Fantastic it really brought her character (Grace) to life. and with a solid acting like that the story keeps you emotionally attached to those poor kids lives. The entire cast has given a brilliant performance, but it's Brie Larson who impresses the most as Grace and the film manages to portray her toughness & fragility evocatively. The locations are very lifelike, the entire film has a very calm & relaxed atmosphere for which the shooting location is responsible for, editing is finely done & it is smartly written & directed. On an overall scale, Short Term 12 is one of those dramas that are heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time that will have you go through every emotion you're capable of and dares to deal with issues most people or families aren't very comfortable viewing or discussing about. If you didn't watch Short term 12 yet and you're looking for a heartwarming and inspiring than you better watch :) ..!!",Short Term 12

I lost count of how many times I had to stop to take a deep breath and cry. Important to understand how silence can be the best way to say something. Or the only way to say something. A film to be revised again and again, because it contains doses of inspirational and essential humanity. More than recommended! One of the best surprises of the year.

Jumping ditches that do not see the long end and crossing long barbed wire fences that surround other barbed wire fences. Being rejected with all the strength. With verbal and physical violence. It happens, sometimes, that all this is nothing but an underlying and latent invitation to enter, to get you in. A test to see if you are really interested... get in. Violence and abuse are great builders of partition walls; pain cements them so that they can hold up years, decades, always. Thick walls to withstand any impact.

I'am constantly searching Google i.e.- Most underrated movies, best movies you haven't heard of, etc. Sometimes when I'am desperate I go to news & community and try to find a new list by another member who just might have a recommendation that will catch my eye. But VERY often that is not the case. I have seen this movie on lists before and immediately pass on it. It didn't win any major awards, and It didn't have any names of actors I liked. Too many times we pass on movies we think we've seen or heard of before and out of fear that it will disappoint and waste our time we don't watch them. This was a movie that I'm glad i spent my time with. What an Unbelievable performance by Larson and a few others. I know this movie was not up for any Oscars but I knew it had to at least have been nominated for an Independent spirit award. Because they more than often get it right. And i was happy Larson and Stanfield got there due. Because they are so convincing and authentic it makes the movie. So many times actors try to act instead of showcase something special with their ability.

164,AirlineFood,Nothing can prepare you for the amount of crying you will do,8,24 January 2016,"Packing an incredibly emotional punch, Short Term 12 explores the complexities of childhood trauma with grace (pun not intended) and subtly. The understated performances (namely Brie Larson's) provide a sense of realism to the film, to the point where it feels as though you are witnessing real events unfold before you. The film's major flaw is its uninspired cinematography, relying too heavily on shaky-cam and never using a shot to convey anything other than what the actors are portraying. Despite this flaw, the film's delicate script and the rich characters allow it to transcend its small scale boundaries. Shifting between the hilarious and the heart-wrenching with ease but never staying into cliché, the film tells a poignant tale that's engaging throughout.",Short Term 12
165,eugeniacartron,How to warm a heart,9,24 January 2014,"Careful, there might be some spoilers ahead, sorry. So, I've read small reviews from people I know praising this movie and Brie Larson's acting in particular, it got me intrigued, so I thought I could check it out. Man, what a right choice. I'm no movie critic, but I loved this movie so much that I just wanted to write a small piece for anyone deciding if they should spend an hour and a half of their lives watching it, my advice is: absolutely, drop everything you're doing and watch it. Brie Larson's Grace is amazing, she has a past that still torments her, but she decided to make the best of it by helping these hopeless kids with such a motherly nature, she's soft and cool, she knows how to handle them and doesn't back off easily, or at all; she has flaws, doesn't always make the right decisions, but you see her struggle and try. Her co-worker and long-term boyfriend is the sweetest, they're made for each other, and everything they do is genuine. Those two actors are pretty damn good if you ask me, they just deliver every single thing with such heart, it's almost impossible not to believe them. The supporting characters are also really good, Keith Stanfield is amazing as Marcus and I've found out is also a talented musician, his track at the end of the film is really cool. The girl playing Jayden, the new kid (who I remember from a small part in The Spectacular Now, also a really great film) has some troubles, her mother just died and she's not giving her father such an easy time, per say. The connection between her and Grace is palpable, and their scenes together are gut-wrenching. I don't exactly know how this type of places work, I don't know if this is portrayed accurately or a little pink-colored, but there's no denying that this is the movie with the biggest heart I've seen in a very long time, excluding The Spectacular Now. Give it a shot, in my experience, I can say that it might remind you not to be so hard on yourself and everyone else the whole time. Be kind, everyone is going through some sort of struggle at the time, why waste time being mean when you can not be? This makes a must-see for me. I hope it is for you too.",Short Term 12
166,Tristan_Carter44,Short Term 12 feels so real and is so underrated,10,12 January 2014,"A few months back, when I first heard of Short Term 12, I wasn't too interested in it. I saw the trailer, and I felt like it was something I'd watch someday, but not really like. I was so wrong.I haven't been to a place exactly like Short Term 12, but I have spent some time in psychiatric hospitals and rehab, and I can say, watching this film, I felt nostalgia towards being in rehab. The teens felt like people I'd met, and their reactions to things seemed so real, such as lashing out, trying to run away, swearing, crying, not being apart of group. The characters seemed like a family, and in places like that, you do sort of become a family.I have not seen another movie that showed such a realistic portrayal of this sort of place. My only real issue with this was the way Grace acted, as in telling the kids about her issues and going to Jayden's house and destroying her father's car. In reality, I couldn't see her acting out like that, but, I reminded myself that it is a movie, and more ridiculous things have happened in so many other films.Short Term 12 is a beautiful film, that really reaches out and touches the viewer's heart. For people who have spent time in places like Short Term 12, I would definitely recommend this film, even though it can easily be a trigger. It is one of the best films of 2013, with a great performance from Brie Larson.",Short Term 12
167,joydalguntas,A Short and Sweet Review of One of The Best Independent Films Around,10,25 May 2014,"Short Term 12 is a film filled with an array of raw emotion which makes this such a beautiful story. The director Destin Cretton created a masterpiece and every actor plays his or her role with an amazing amount of truth. This independent drama is an emotional experience because of the empathy that you have for the characters. Anyone can relate to these are scenarios because they are real, and in fact are many issues that kids, and even adults face everyday. The amount of catharsis you will have is amazing because there is universal sense of compassion and love for others. If you skip out on this movie, you really are missing out.",Short Term 12
168,bryan-a-sills,A Good Movie With a Great Performance by Brie Larson,8,25 March 2014,"At the core of the film, Short Term 12 is a story about Grace (Brie Larson), a supervisor at a short-term foster care facility. It follows her life, both at the facility and in the rest of the world, as she deals with a stressful time in her life. She is a very loving and caring person, but she has her own demons and sometimes she unable to separate her own problems from her problems at work. Larson does a great job of portraying this person getting worn thin by the problems in her life and retreating emotionally from people who care about her, all while being this strong leader for very troubled youth. John Gallagher and Kaitlyn Dever also have great performances as Mason, Grace's boyfriend and co- worker, and Jayden, a young girl living at Short Term 12 who Grace sees a lot of herself in.Destin Cretton, the writer and director, does a great job of developing these characters, as each scene gives the audience insight into who these people are and why they act the way they do. While some of the criticism of presenting problem's through children's stories is valid, I'm going to withhold too much judgment because it allows us to see these kids as actual people, instead of files and descriptions.Overall, this is a good movie worth seeing just for Brie Larson's acting alone. This movie tackles a difficult subject with very broken people, but it handles them in a sincere and honest way to a very rewarding end.",Short Term 12
169,liberace-38495,wasted potential,5,27 May 2015,"This could have been a good movie, except for the overwhelming presence of bad language and disgustingly detailed descriptions of bodily functions. This becomes an immediate turn-off. We don't need to hear these same words over and over again. We've heard them too much already! We didn't need to hear an entire, disgracefully-worded ""rap"" diatribe to get the idea. A small sample would have been sufficient. We didn't need to hear an entire description of the consequences of somebody's upset stomach in the very first scene. Think this is clever? Think it adds realism? Well, think again!

170,DylanKalaydjian,Emotionally Devastating,10,12 December 2015,"Short Term 12 is easily the best film of 2013. It's charming, brisk, funny, thrilling, romantic, and emotionally devastating; but in the best way possible. To be clear, I cried twice while watching this. Twice. Maybe it's because I'm a little soft, but it represents life in a brilliantly beautiful light. The performances are all excellent; Katilyn Dever and John Gallagher Jr. are great, but Brie Larson is the real standout. In one of her earlier breakout roles, her performance as Grace is phenomenal. The supporting cast, including Raimi Malek, Stephanie Beatriz and Keith Standfield, is also extremely strong. What makes this film special though is the way that it is both incredibly moving yet also heartbreaking; to be honest, it may take a while for me to watch this film again. There are pivotal scenes difficult to watch, simply because they're so emotional. Short Term 12 is devastating, uplifting, inspiring, excellently cast, beautiful and one of my favourite films of all time.",Short Term 12

172,amackie-45649,Fantastic Work of Art,9,26 January 2016,"I am a movie snob. I do not like to spend 2+ hours of my day or night watching a film whose characters leave me as soon as the credits roll. I watched Short Term 12 over a week ago, and the characters are still with me as vividly as if I had watched it an hour ago. I suspect it will be with me a year from now, or longer. In fact, I liked the movie so much, I am writing this review . . . my very first. Short Term 12 is, to me, above all else, a character study. This movie proves that story always matters; high-budget special effects mean nothing if not adequately supported by a good story with compelling characters. This movie has nothing in the way of special effects, but, oh, what a wonderful story with characters that are so real that I found myself forgetting that they are not real people! It actually feels, at times, like more of a documentary, though don't let that scare you off if you're not a fan of documentaries. It's a compliment that the actors were so convincing. The story centers on Grace, a counselor at a facility that serves as a temporary home for teens and preteens between foster homes . . . as best that I could ascertain. Grace and her boyfriend, Mason, do their best to be comforting, reassuring figures for the kids living there. Their job is to ""keep them safe."" Still, they are so much more than counselors to these kids. I will not relate the entire story, but there are a few points I feel compelled to mention. Namely, Jayden and Marcus are the characters with whom I most sympathized. Yes, Grace is the lead character and Brie Larson NAILED the role, but Marcus and Jayden both stole my heart. Many reviews relate Marcus' rap scene and Jayden's scene in which she reads her Octopus story to Grace as the most heart-wrenching moments (and they were indeed powerful), but for whatever reason, it was Jayden's reaction to the birthday cards the other kids made for her that got my eyes watery. In a masterful stroke of subtle foreshadowing, it is complemented at the end when Jayden has the cards displayed on her wall . . . it is one of the sweetest moments in film I have ever seen. Suffice it to say, I loved this little movie. If you like good character studies, this is one you cannot miss. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention how much I liked they way the movie begins and ends . . . with lovable, foul-mouthed Mason telling a story in front of the building and the subsequent chaotic (yet not at all surprising to Grace and Mason) ""chase.""",Short Term 12
173,aschazam,Flawless filmmaking.,10,23 February 2016,"It's not very often in today's times that you find a movie as artistically genius as Short Term 12. The film has gotten nowhere near the amount of publicity it should. The storyline of Short Term 12 is incredibly moving with strong character development and cinematography that makes not only the overall film, but each frame a piece of art. The film revolves around a short term home for children who come from poor home situations. These kids don't know how to live properly in society. At this home, they learn how to better be around people and what it means to be a part of a family. The story follows Grace (Brie Johnson) as she attempts to help these children deal with their own pasts, while still struggling with her own. Newcomer Jayden (Kaitlin Denver) challenges Grace in new way. Jadyen has experienced many of the same problems as Grace, and she is now forced to deal with the problems she's been avoiding for years. As the film progresses, we see these struggles take over Grace's life and her ragged attempts to resolve them. Short Term 12 has no flashy lights, elaborate costumes, or anything for the actors to hide behind. The average budget for a new film is usually somewhere from $25 million to $100 million, whereas this movie had less than $1 million for all of production. Despite this apparent disadvantage, the raw sort of filming works perfectly with this story. Much of the lighting looks very natural, with different color intensity depending on the setting for the scene. When at the home things are very faded and gray, but when visiting family, things become more colorful and vibrant. It's all very simplistic and makes it feel realistic. Sound is another important part of the aesthetic experience, and this film certainly doesn't lack there. Sounds such as a baby crying are projected in the back of speakers, pretty much surrounding you and making you feel like you're a part of this world. The little music that is used throughout is often soothing and acoustic, but in times of high tension it becomes more edgy and rough. The strongest aspect of Short Term 12 is the characters. Brie Johnson puts on one of the most moving performances, as she shows Grace's progression of emotions. She creates this wall for her character, and slowly breaks it down while making herself seem more and more vulnerable. Something that really stands out is how she always picks her hand when she's nervous, something stemming back from her childhood. At one point, she even is playing with her boyfriend's hands before telling him big news. But Johnson isn't the only one with this kind of ability. Keith Stanfield, who plays Marcus (an inhabitant of Short Term 12), has very little lines to base his character off of. Yet his story manages to be one of the most heartbreaking parts of the film. Stanfield has a way of being able to portray an emotion with just his body, most importantly his eyes. He has this quality about him that just sends shivers down your spine. Short Term 12 has such a beautiful storyline that makes even the toughest viewer begin to feel weak, most likely shedding a tear or two. The cinematography really helps carry the emotion through every scene. All the characters are so well developed that you'll notice something new about one of them each time you watch it. Because if you've seen this film once, you're going to want to see it again. And again. And probably again. And each time you'll connect with this heartbreaking and heartwarming story, because that's just how effective this movie is.",Short Term 12
174,oisintomas,A wonderfully heartfelt film- A much watch!!,10,2 January 2017,"The film is set in a short term foster-care facility for at-risk teens and follows trials and tribulations of the teens living their and staff members Grace (Larson) and Mason (Gallagher Jr.) who take care of them. When a new child arrives at the facility, it forces Grace to confront her troubled past whilst continuing her struggle in preparing soon-to-be 18 Marcus (Keith Stanfield) for life outside of the care facility. The film is inspired by Cretton's experience of working in a foster-care facility for young people and this helps the film tell an emotionally honest and heart-wrenching story, avoiding most of the tropes and clichés common in these type of films. It was met with critical acclaim when was first released and won the Grand Jury Narrative Feature Award and the Narrative Audience Award at South by Southwest Film festival. Short Term 12 features masterful storytelling, its tightly scripted with natural everyday dialogue that comes across as real and improvised and is cemented by true to life , seemingly effortless and naturalistic form of acting with performances so-convincing it almost makes you feel like your watching a documentary. There are no one dimensional characters in the film and each feel authentic. In particular Brie Larson gives a impressive and awe-inspiring performance as grace a caring and loving young women with heavy baggage from her past locked up tight and bursting at the seams due to her inability to trust and open up to people. She was nominated for numerous accolades for her performance in the film and won Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Actress. The two scenes that bookend the film were particularly interesting. The film opens with Mason telling Nate (a new worker in the facility) and Jessica an embarrassing and comedic story of his first week working at the facility. This excellently establishes the friendships between the characters with natural interaction between them which is a pleasure to watch. Before mason finishes telling the story, a child in his underpants with American flag wrapped around him like a Cape, busts out and makes a run for the exit. The ending scene also contains mason telling a funny story and again the story is interrupted by Sammy running for the exit. This excellently reinforces the naturalistic style of the film as it shows the audience that the narrative includes the everyday struggles of the characters and that there are no easy solutions. Additionally the scenes are similar but the differences effectively showcase how things have subtly changed. It particular they show how our relationship to the characters have evolved. at the start of the movie, we were in the shoes of Nate (not knowing what to expect) . At the end, we are more familiar with the characters and have a better understanding of what happens at the facility. The film is shot predominantly using hand-held cameras and consists mostly of medium and close-ups shots.The shots are tightly framed and this help make the viewer feel as close to the emotions on screen as possible. The camera is a patient, unobtrusive presence among the characters and the almost observational style also strengthens the audience's emotional connection to the characters in the film. Though some may criticize the rather convenient and perfect intertwining of individual narratives and struggles throughout the film as well as its irrepressible sense of optimism, I feel the film sticks to his naturalistic style effectively, never becoming melodramatic or unbelievable. The various revelations that occur throughout the film come to us organically in characters' conversation and it has beautifully crafted lighting which gives a warm glow to the film and a beautiful sense of optimism. In the hands of a less talented director, the film could have felt overly-sentimental and syrupy but instead feels brutally honest with the right amount of grit and grace. In closing short term 12 is a marvel of a film. It is perfectly scripted piece of drama that features wonderful performances and a genuine and heartfelt story that will stick with you long after you watch the film.",Short Term 12
