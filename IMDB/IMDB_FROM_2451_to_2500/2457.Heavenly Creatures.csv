0,TheLittleSongbird,One of Peter Jackson's best films,10,27 September 2010,"Words cannot describe how good this film was. This is easily one of Peter Jackson's best films, and I think his most emotional and in many ways. Heavenly Creatures is disturbing and shocking, but it is also very beautiful, haunting and quite thoughtful as well, as well as having a masterly mix of nostalgia, menace and innocence. It looks beautiful, with the cinematography simply stunning, and the score is both haunting and beautiful. The story is interesting and the dialogue makes you think and even more than that. Peter Jackson directs wonderfully, and boasts superb performances not only from Kate Winslet and especially Melanie Lynksey- who is mesmerising in the more controlled and I suppose meatier role- but also from Diana Kent, Clive Morrison and Sarah Peirse. Overall, brilliant and one of Jackson's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Heavenly Creatures
1,Leofwine_draca,"A well-shot and interesting tale, but not one I found particularly engrossing",6,26 July 2016,"Director Peter Jackson calms down a bit after the manic gore fests of BAD TASTE and BRAINDEAD to give us what it undoubtedly his maturest work to date. It's certainly one of his most well-made and beautiful films, with some really stunning scenes in it - such as the moment where a cornfield becomes a royal garden complete with hedges, colourful flowers, and fountains. Filmed in New Zealand, the scenery of the woodlands and countryside is never less than breathtaking, and Jackson retains human interest also by offering interesting camera angles and situations throughout.Based on a true story, this is a very realistic and slow-paced film, with dialogue that rings true. Unfortunately I did find a lot of the lovey-dovey dialogue in the film quite irritating, even if it was a mark of the '50s era in which the story is set. Lynskey and Winslet are excellent in the roles of the friends, but even the supporting cast are very good too, each filling out the roles of the slightly odd, mannered and very much human characters that they place.There are some truly inspired and shocking moments in this film, like when Orson Welles walks on to the screen or the first time we see the life-sized clay men...thanks to some very impressive computer effects work these are highly convincing. After all the slow-build up and human drama, the bloody murder at the very end of the film is unpleasant and graphic, all the more so for being totally unexpected. This counters the serene feel of the rest of the movie and is thus more horrific for it.So, a well-made film with fine acting and an interesting story. Why didn't I rate it higher? The simple fact is that I didn't find this film to be particularly moving or engrossing, although it is well made enough to be thoroughly watchable. After all the hype I had heard about it, the movie could only disappoint me, although most other viewers would probably think of it as wonderful.",Heavenly Creatures
2,SnoopyStyle,wonderful performances,8,14 November 2015,"In 1952 Christchurch, New Zealand, 14-year-old Pauline Yvonne Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a bitter introverted student from an all-girls school. Juliet Marion Hulme (Kate Winslet) is the flamboyant new girl from England. Pauline forms a friendship with Juliet obsessed with their imaginary Fourth World. Juliet's parents abandon her in the hospital with TB. Pauline's mother becomes concerned about her rebellious turn and the girls' possible homosexuality.These are two amazing performances. Lynskey is a wonderful weird introvert. The girls bring out the desperation of puberty coming-of-age. Director Peter Jackson brings out an interesting imaginary world. The movie brings out an early sign of wonder things to come.",Heavenly Creatures
3,Prismark10,Out of bounds,6,21 February 2016,"Peter Jackson known for low budget gory splat movies from New Zealand makes his first steps in serious film making in this murder drama based on a true incident.The film opens with the aftermath of the slaying as two teenage girls emerge hysterical from the woods in Christchurch.The film is about two schoolgirls, Mario Lanza, Orson Welles and living in early 1950s New Zealand which might had been decades behind the 1950s where rock n roll was to emerge in America.Awkward, morose, gawky schoolgirl Pauline (Melanie Lynsky) meets a new arrival from England, Juliet (Kate Winslet) who is confident, clever and brings Pauline out of her shell. Both bond closely with their love of opera and begin to live in a fantasy land which also allows Jackson to keep his horror fans satisfied with special effects scenes.The friendship between Juliet and Pauline soon becomes unhealthy as they feel superior and reality and fantasy collides. Pauline is resentful of her hokey, backwards family, especially her mother. Not helped by them not understanding her burgeoning sexuality, especially when a older boarder takes advantage of her and they blame the daughter.Juliet is ignored by her self centred parents who on the verge of splitting up and Juliet might end up going to South Africa. As the girls are forcibly kept apart they hatch a violent plan which ends up in disaster and tragedy.This is really a small scale drama from Peter Jackson, a world away from his recent overblown, enormous budget epics with even lengthier directors cuts.Here the acting from Winslet and Lynsky does the talking. Jackson brings the New Zealand of the 1950s to live, a world that is very insular. However the film is an efficient drama, nicely acted, a gory ending but not too far away from a well made television drama with some good special effects.",Heavenly Creatures
4,classicsoncall,"""It's a three act story with a tragic end.""",7,26 May 2018,"I didn't realize this was based on a true story until the end credits when the narrative followed up on the arrest of the two girls. Quite honestly, the story does proceed along as if it were a fictional one, as the obsessive relationship between Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) races headlong toward a disaster that doesn't feel quite real. Director Peter Jackson appears to step out of his comfort zone with this film, though a number of scenes portend the grand spectacle that was to become 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. I was particularly stunned by the the sight of the empty field that miraculously turned into a royal garden, at which point the picture took on an ""Alice in Wonderland"" like quality. The use of the clay-like characters further inspires one to reflect on the mythical world Pauline and Juliet placed themselves in at the expense of the real one around them. Their imaginary 'Fourth World', filled with music, art and beauty became a mask for the reality the girls refused to face when their relationship was about to come to an end. On the face of it, Jackson directs with an eye toward sensitivity and sympathy between Pauline and Juliet, though their horrible deed to culminate the story reveals just how tragic their obsession became despite the efforts of those around them who could not penetrate their mythical Fourth World.",Heavenly Creatures
5,gavin6942,The Birth of Kate Winslet,7,23 March 2015,"Two girls have an intense fantasy life; their parents, concerned the fantasy is too intense, separate them, and the girls take revenge.Up to the point Peter Jackson may have been more of a niche director, known for such films as ""Brain Dead"" and ""Bad Taste"". He quickly moved up in the world, and this film no doubt helped him land the ""Lord of the Rings"" series (which also benefited from his New Zealand homeland). The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay but lost to ""Pulp Fiction"".The story itself is fascinating, and makes you wonder if imagination can be dangerous or if childhood fantasy can be pushed too far. Despite being a fan of Jackson, this went over my head at the time of release. It seems to have grown in stature since, no doubt due to his success and the success of Kate Winslet.",Heavenly Creatures
6,lee_eisenberg,There's a lot that Peter Jackson can do with a true story.,10,12 May 2006,"Hot off ""Dead-Alive"" and a few years before the ""LOTR"" trilogy, Peter Jackson directed what is in my opinion his best movie ever: ""Heavenly Creatures"". It portrays two teenage girls in 1950s New Zealand: working class Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) and wealthy English immigrant Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). After Juliet befriends the somewhat outcast Pauline, they start developing a very unhealthy relationship. But when their parents try to separate them, that's when things really get ugly.This is not just any people-go-crazy story. It's almost scary - but certainly masterful - how Jackson shows their descent into madness. And another thing that the movie shows is that when the adults get suspicious of them, not only do some people think that they're lesbians, but only the working class Pauline gets interrogated. We almost want to identify with these girls, even though we understand the self-destructive nature of their relationship.Anyway, I really think that Peter Jackson accomplished his best work ever here. ""Heavenly Creatures"" is as haunting as it is masterful. Perfect.",Heavenly Creatures
7,jboothmillard,Heavenly Creatures,9,7 September 2005,"Director Peter Jackson was known for making gory films like Bad Taste and Braindead before having his fortunes changed by this drama, and going on to direct the hugely successful Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Based on a true story, with all facts taken from diaries, in 1950's New Zealand, Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet, in her first film role) and Pauline Yvonne Parker (introducing Melanie Lynskey) met each other in school and formed a close, intense and obsessive friendship. They spent every minute possible together, often writing about and imagining themselves in their own fantasy world, which obviously caused concerns for their parents. There comes a point where Juliet and Pauline could be separated, and they see the biggest problem for both of them is Pauline's mother Honora (Sarah Peirse). So they set ""the happy day"" where they plan to run away to America together, after savagely killing Pauline's mother using a brick in a stocking, bludgeoning her to death, smashing her head to a pulp. This plan they saw as being a way to bring them closer together and get away, but of course they were both caught and put in separate prisons, never to see each other again. Also starring Diana Kent as Hilda Hulme, Clive Merrison as Dr. Henry Hulme, Simon O'Connor as Herbert Rieper, Jed Brophy as John / Nicholas, Peter Elliott as Bill Perry, Gilbert Goldie as Dr. Bennett and Geoffrey Heath as Rev. Norris. The talented and beautiful Winslet and a mesmerising Lynskey dominate this film with their very disturbing friendship, and the film with its special effects for the teenage duo's fantasy world creates fantastic nostalgia, innocence and menace. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Kate Winslet was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 29 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 22 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Heavenly Creatures
8,rmax304823,A Room of Their Own,8,26 February 2002,"It would be easy enough to become a fan of movies about weird Australian schoolgirls if they were all as interesting and well done as ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""Heavenly Creatures.""  This more or less true story of Paula and Juliet is nicely directed in a style almost opposite of that in Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock.""  Instead of ominous lingering tableaus, this film uses rather rapid cuts and has far more dash in its dialogue and action.  The stories are equally compelling.  Here, Paula and Juliet share an elaborate fantasy involving a fourth world built upon Dungeon and Dragon sorts of setting and characters, while somehow working in Mario Lanza and Orson Welles.  (The claymation is pretty good.)  There is a not always covert sexual underpinning to their intense friendship.  It isn't offensive because both girls look kind of full blown for fourteen, and it consists of so much in the way of implication that it wouldn't be terribly perverse if they looked younger.  Speaking of covert messages, the linguist Deborah Tannen has posited two different interactional styles:  the masculine, in which bonding is based on shared action; and the feminine, centered on shared secrets.  I have no problem with that general argument.  Yet, despite her oft-repeated denials and perfunctory qualifications, Tannen clearly believes the feminine style to be better than the masculine.  This movie, it is interesting to note, is a valuable corrective to her simplistic value judgments.  These two girls demonstrate the feminine interactional style in esse.  Boy, do they share a secret fantasy.  They seem to live in a room of their own or inside each others' heads.  But when things begin to go wrong -- and they do -- they have little problem bashing in the head of Paula's mother.  Men may bond by going to war but women are capable of killing too -- each gender striving to maintain its own fantasy about itself.  In retrospect the way the girls' relationship was handled looks bad.  How dumb can parents and authority figures get?  Why not leave the girls alone?  Why is their infatuation with one another labeled ""unhealthy"" when it's only unusual?  But the film wisely doesn't make those sorts of facile judgments. The parents aren't made into living horrors.  They're simply worried and angry, creatures bound by the mores of the times they lived in, just as we are, although, like the parents in this movie, we are unable to step outside the box sufficiently to realize it.  This is a watchable flick.",Heavenly Creatures
9,moonspinner55,I felt like the parents did--completely shut out,4,1 June 2007,"Two misfit schoolgirls in 1952 New Zealand form a close bond, tuning their parents out while creating an intimate world of deceitful fantasy. Peter Jackson, who directed and co-wrote the fact-based screenplay, helms the proceedings with an intense, chilly romanticism which is initially arresting. Unfortunately, his film is nearly done-in by the broader strokes, which gives the film an artificial, off-putting resonance. As youngsters Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme, debuting actresses Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet are unsubtle and, as rendered by the filmmakers here, unreachable. This piece, which rests so firmly on whether we can respond to the girls, gives us two belligerent young ladies who are practically beyond repair. The adults fare no better, which isn't surprising: Jackson only leaves them scraps of scenes. The talented director's primary vision is bristly and gripping, yet the tremulous story threads are practically buried underneath the stylistic bombast. ** from ****",Heavenly Creatures
10,Quinoa1984,"a tale of two girls, with a certain passion for life, and each other",10,24 October 2006,"Heavenly Creatures may be the best film I've seen so far from Peter Jackson, even after having gone through the Lord of the Rings, King Kong, even Dead-Alive. His film is loaded with so much that it's hard to classify it as one specific thing, and its psychological complexities make it something special. One way to describe the picture is that it's about the stirring friendship-cum-relationship of Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) in 1950s New Zealand. Another way to describe it is showing the other side, the much darker side, of a coming of age story, where youth have to come to terms with realities, with horrific results. And even another way is that it's another in a big line of independent films that work on the relationship between fantasy and reality, or rather the practical need for abstractions to try and not get too close to the mundane, and then the all too hard to accept realities around the characters.But there's another way to describe it too that I like best, and that also marks it as something even more special than some might realize- it's one of those rare, sensational takes on what it's like to be in that dreadful cocoon of an age at 14 and 15, when hormones go completely insane, parents are more of an enemy and force to be reckoned with than a helpful, compassionate side like when younger, and at times the world seems like it could end at any moment if something changed for the worse. This is where I think Jackson strikes it hardest and most fulfilling, even as the other descriptions are not un-true at all. In this case, Juliet and Pauline are at that age, and when they first meet they first connect very strongly, being outsiders in their class, though completely in tune with their fantasy life of romanticized worlds, knights, an opera singer, and (some) male movie stars. But this becomes complicated more once they first get briefly separated due to Juliet's illness, and when they meet again there are suspicions from both sides of the family ('homosexuality' is shown in a close-up shot of the mouth of one of the father's saying it, as if it's like the plague), and the dysfunctions of Juliet's side end up drawing things to its very tragic end.Along with the substance being at a very high quality, of a script that deftly combines the elements of lush fantasy mixing and matching- sometimes without discerning- through a powerful subjective viewpoint, mostly through Pauline, there's unexpected scenes that are touching. For example, there's a scene where she reluctantly loses her virginity to a boarder, and through this she keeps cutting back and forth in her dulled state to clay knights. This is a motif, I suppose, that is expounded upon alongside the narration from Pauline, which adds her subjectivity to a fault. And all the while the objectivity becomes pushed aside, or at least is questioned. What is it to be so different from how everyone in this 1950s time views their uncommon bond? Whether they are or aren't lesbian is up for debate, it's left ambiguous even when its put up-front in the last twenty minutes. And all the while, Jackson directs it stylistically with the same verve he had with his early films, though balancing the wild fantasy with the grounded reality; he's even playful with it, however dark, which includes a great tip-of-the-hat to Orson Welles and the Third Man.All the while, too, the performances by the two leads are stellar. It's actually shocking to see Lynskey not get better roles since, as her Pauline is totally defined and made real and, at least in some sort of emotional way at times, relatable or sympathetic. Winslet, meanwhile, has one of her best here, as the more outward one personality-wise of the two, who is even more immersed in the fantasy than Pauline, but has a vulnerability that is crushing. Everything combines together then- the direction, the writing, the performances and the actual mixed psychology behind it, and it becomes quite memorable. It's not a very easy picture to watch at times, and its implications are disturbing, but it has more guts and determination to tell its story full-on than many others I can think of.

11,Coventry,The absolute opposite of Bad Taste!,9,17 February 2007,"Despite being a huge fan of Peter Jackson's splatter-classics ""Bad Taste"" and ""Braindead"", this ultra-stylish and distinguished period drama felt like a welcome surprise and it more than clearly indicated how Jackson is an extremely versatile filmmaker, rather than just a sick puppy with an unhealthy interest in severed body parts. ""Heavenly Creatures"" is (very truthfully) based on a notorious real-life murder that took place in New Zealand during the 1950's. Two teenage schoolgirls, whose intimate friendship quickly got rejected by all the adults surrounding them, brutally killed the mother of one of them. Rather than purely building up towards this ultimately grisly and disturbing murder, Peter Jackson surprisingly dedicates a lot of time and effort into re-enacting the close friendship between Juliet (a clever and eloquent English immigrant) and Pauline (an introvert and docile local working-class daughter). From their first encounters in the schoolyard, over their development of common tastes in movies & music, to the eventual fleeing into their own utopia-world known as the Fourth World. Kate Winslet  in her debut  is amazing as the headstrong Juliet, who drags Pauline along in her fascination for crooner Mario Lanza and eerie actor Orson Welles until both girls become dangerously inseparable. When the parents then begin to worry about their daughters' wayward and peculiar behavior, the girls bring out their daydreaming to the real world, with very deadly results. ""Heavenly Creatures"" is a very powerful film! In case you still have any doubts regarding the subject, it's not just the story of two lesbians versus the rest of the world, but a truly gripping & tasteful drama that masterfully captures the prudish life-styles of the 1950's and puts genuine acting talents into the spotlights. The end sequence is harrowing and very unsettling. Jackson's previous films ""Bad Taste"" and especially ""Braindead"" all together featured approximately 500 gory massacres, yet not one of them felt as painful & intense as the sole murder in ""Heavenly Creatures"". Excellent movie with great acting, great atmospheric tension and dazzling music. Highly recommended to all the true fans of cinema.",Heavenly Creatures
12,michaelRokeefe,Shocking friendship.,9,16 March 2010,"Peter Jackson directs this film based on the true story of two young teens that carried out the most notorious murder in New Zealand history. HEAVENLY CREATURES is based on the diaries of Pauline Rieper Parker(Melanie Lynskey)a 16-year old school girl that enters a very strong friendship with new classmate 15-year old Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet). The two have a relationship that probably blurs the borderline of obsession; constantly together and creating a fantasy world in which they believed to live. There were intimations of insanity and the most shocking...lesbianism. The girls planned and carried out the bludgeoning of Pauline's mother(Sarah Peirse); proving to stop at nothing to protect their friendship.This comes very early in the careers of Jackson and Winslet. It is the introduction of Lynskey that draws the most attention. The two girls between scenes and throughout the shooting of the film would interact with each other as their characters. Lynskey is better known currently for playing Rose on TV's Two and Half Men series starring Charlie Sheen. When comparing with research of the actual murder in 1954, this film is very dead on(no pun intended). And it is uncanny how the young Lynskey resembled Pauline. In supporting roles are: Diana Kent, Clive Merrison and Simon O'Connor.",Heavenly Creatures
13,Theo Robertson,A Beautiful Haunting Story Of Teenage Obsession,8,3 July 2004,"Lesbian murderers ? I'm sort of guessing that I might not like this movie very much . No doubt we'll be seeing some polemical do gooder film maker with zero talent making a movie where anyone who gets murdered by the gay girls probably asked for it because they were a rabid homophobeThat was my abstract opinion of HEAVENLY CREATURES when it was released to some critical acclaim ten years ago , with much of the acclaim going to writer/director Peter Jackson whose previous gory horror comedies I'd enjoyed . Yeah the guy was talented I remember thinking , but in a liberal climate we'd no doubt be hearing a myriad of excuses via the film for the girls crime and it was this attitude that stopped me from watching the movie until it was broadcast on BBC 2 tonight I was fooling myself if I thought Jackson was going to make a bad movie . This is another piece of heart melting , intelligent movie making from the Kiwi genius and I'm sorry for doubting Jackson for a moment . What Jackson has done has made a movie where it's difficult to think of the two protagonists as "" lesbian lovers "" , Pauline Reiper and Juliet Hulme are two teenagers who love each other full stop and the screenplay doesn't once make any excuses for anything that happens , we're not supposed to feel disgusted by their relationship , we're not supposed to feel that they are victims in any way and we're not supposed to feel that a conservative , homophobic society is to blame for what happened . Jackson deserves much credit for making an amoral movie without an agenda , it's up to the free thinking audience to make up their own minds on the case. Take for example the murder of Mrs Rieper who kindly takes the girls to a tea house then for a walk in the countryside . It's difficult not to notice that if she'd been an uncaring cruel dragon with absolutely no conscience the girls wouldn't have had an opportunity to murder the woman .It's also a movie that captures the spirit of being a teenager in love . When for whatever reason you have to say goodbye to your first love it's the end of the world . You'll do anything to stop it happening - ANYTHING - and you won't forgive anyone who caused it to happen . Fantasy sequences similar to the ones shown here are also a staple diet of the teenage mind and if you disagree with me you're either being dishonest or you're under twelve years of age . Believe me this movie reminded me , perhaps a little too much , of my own teenage angst Jackson also deserves credit for his casting Melanie Lynskey and ( A then totally unknown ) Kate Winslet as Pauline and Juliet . Neither of them can be described as strikingly attractive and you do have to worry who we would have got instead if this was a Hollywood production , but they play the star crossed lovers with absolute conviction , as indeed do the rest of the castHEAVENLY CREATURES is beautiful , haunting , thoughtful and incisive . With the exception of Martin Scorsese I rate Peter Jackson as the world's greatest living film maker and HEAVENLY CREATURES is the first movie that showed the true greatness Jackson is capable of",Heavenly Creatures
14,preppy-3,Disturbing but fascinating,8,21 December 1999,"Based on real events, 2 girls meet in 1950s New Zealand, fall in love, murder someone.  Despite what it sounds like, this movie is NOT homophobic--that don't kill somebody because they're lesbians.  Just certain circumstances bring it about, and society won't allow them to be open about their love.  Peter Jackson does another great directing job (this man can do anything!), superb performances by everybody (although Winslet doesn't need to YELL all the time), very tense and suspenseful plot (you know how it's going to end, but you're still nervous as hell watching it), beautiful special effects which are seamlessly worked into reality.  Fascinating, disturbing, unbelievable.  DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!!

20,JamesHitchcock,"The New Zealand cinema finds its own ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"".",10,25 September 2009,"To celebrate my 700th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films. ""Heavenly Creatures"" was is the film which first brought to international attention Peter Jackson, later to win fame as the director of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It is based on the notorious 1954 Parker-Hulme murder, committed by two teenage girls in Christchurch, New Zealand, and is told from the viewpoint of the girls themselves.The two girls, as depicted in this film, are very different. Juliet Hulme, originally from England, is from an upper-middle-class background, the daughter of the distinguished scientist Henry Hulme, a professor at Christchurch University. She is attractive, outgoing and with a self-confidence bordering on arrogance. (Our first view of her comes when she puts down her French teacher, who has made a grammatical error in a sentence written on the blackboard). Pauline Parker, a native-born New Zealander from a working-class background, is shy and withdrawn. (I use the name by which Pauline became known to the world, although before her trial she was known either as Pauline Rieper or Yvonne Rieper, and was variously nicknamed by Juliet ""Charles"", ""Paul"" or ""Gina"". Pauline's nickname for Juliet was ""Deborah"", pronounced in the old manner with the stress on the second syllable).Despite their different backgrounds the girls quickly become first close friends then lesbian lovers. What the film makes clear, however, is that their relationship is based upon more than just friendship and more than just sexual desire. One thing they have in common is an extraordinarily vivid imagination. Both harbour the ambition to become writers and they have invented the imaginary kingdom of Borovnia, complete with its own Royal Family and citizens; much of their time is taken up with making clay models of these fictional characters, or acting out their adventures (Their nicknames Charles, Deborah and Gina are taken from this Borovnian mythology).Even more importantly, they have rejected Christianity in favour of their own religion, based around the ""Fourth World"". (The other three worlds are presumably Earth, Hell and the conventional Heaven). This, conceived as a place of ""music, art and endless pleasure"", is a sort of super-heaven available only to those of superior artistic or spiritual sensitivities such as the girls imagine themselves to be. (They regard themselves as ""heavenly creatures, hence the title). Those artistic figures whom the girls particularly admire, such as the tenor Mario Lanza or the actor James Mason, are regarded as ""Saints"" who will have their place in the Fourth World. (Pauline's attempt to canonise Orson Welles, however, is vetoed by Juliet, who regards him as repulsive). A central tenet of this religion is that it is possible, through mystical experiences, to access the Fourth World for brief periods during this lifetime, something they refer to as ""Finding the Key"".Another shared link between the girls is their rejection of their social backgrounds; Juliet rejects the hypocrisy and conventionality of the bourgeois Hulmes, while Pauline despises the Philistinism of the working-class Riepers. Both loathe the stifling conformity of their school and the educational system in general. What gives their relationship its strength, therefore, is the ability it gives them to escape from their mundane everyday world into a blissful alternative reality through shared mystical experiences. Their parents, who fear that their daughters' relationship is becoming ""unhealthy"" -fifties euphemism for sexual-, are seen as obstacles to the girls' happiness. Although all four believe that the girls need to be separated, the girls come to see Pauline's mother Honora as their main enemy, and therefore come up with a plan to kill her.The film introduced two hugely talented young actresses, Kate Winslet (who has of course gone on to become a major star) and Melanie Lynskey, who is not quite so well known. This was Winslet's first film, and in my view remains her best- a quite sensational debut- but Lynskey deserves as much credit for its success. The contrast in character between the two girls is emphasised by their different styles of acting, Winslet vibrant and passionate, Lynskey intense and moody. Also deserving of credit are the four actors who play the girls' parents. Although they may have seemed to Pauline and Juliet like monsters, they were in reality two quite normal couples, bewildered by and unable to cope with the intense love which had grown up between their daughters.What makes ""Heavenly Creatures"" so remarkable, apart from the acting, is the ability of Jackson and the scriptwriter Fran Walsh, who is also his wife, to enter into the imaginary world of the two main characters, both their ""Borovnian"" stories and their visions of the Fourth World. This is done by elaborate fantasy sequences, in which Juliet and Pauline run through a New Zealand countryside which is now the home of unicorns and butterflies the size of eagles, and in which their clay Borovnian figures come to life, all to the strains of Mario Lanza.Most films about real-life crimes, although there are exceptions such as the excellent ""Ten Rillington Place"" are either earnest and preachy or dryly factual. ""Heavenly Creatures"", however, falls into neither of these categories. It is, in my view, the best-ever true-crime film (and best-ever film about lesbianism), distinguished by a literate script, great acting, especially from its two young stars, and above all some truly imaginative direction. It is a film which shows how characteristics which in themselves might seem admirable- love, imagination, religious sensibility- can combine to produce a sort of madness leading to a brutal and shocking crime.Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is often cited as the first great Australian film, marking the moment when the Australian cinema came of age. (That film too also involved a group of teenage schoolgirls with mystical, quasi-religious tendencies). With ""Heavenly Creatures"" the New Zealand cinema has found its own ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"". 10/10",Heavenly Creatures
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Kate's Big Break,9,12 March 2007,"I am a huge fan of Kate Winslet, she is my favorite actress of all time, simply because she is possibly the most honest. It seems like she has the most natural talent and when she has a role she embraces it, recently I had a message from a IMDb user who asked me if I saw this film and if I hadn't, I should due to the fact that Kate was amazing in it. I also noticed it in my ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"" book, so I had passed it over at Hollywood Video and figured to give it a look. I noticed also that it was directed by Peter Jackson who is now more famous due to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but I thought this film was really over looked and one of his finest. It's incredibly unique, artistic, and disturbing in some ways.Pauline is a out cast at school and she meets the new girl, Juliet, together they find out that they have a major thing in common, a wile imagination. They want to write a story together, they go as far as to call each other by their story names and spend time with each other constantly. But the parent's concerns grow more and more as the girls become a little more... ""obsessive"" of each other. Juliet's parents wish to send to her Africa to live with her aunt, but Juliet and Pauline do not want to let go of each other, and Pauline sees only one obstacle keeping them from seeing each other, her mom. So they devise an evil plan to get rid of her mom, permanently.Heavenly Creatures was incredibly unique and an amazing film. I couldn't believe my eyes watching this film, it was so interesting to watch, especially being in these girl's minds and imagination. Kate and Melanie had great chemistry and Peter Jackson made this film into his own. I would recommend it for movie buffs and definitely if you want to see how Kate got her start, she was amazing.9/10",Heavenly Creatures
22,MovieAddict2016,Peter Jackson needs to go back and start making movies like this again,8,23 January 2006,"In retrospect, you'd never know this is a Peter Jackson film. Not after becoming familiar with his recent work, anyway. ""Heavenly Creatures"" contains all the subtlety and nuances that his later work desperately needs - the graceful arc of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, despite its critical lauding, doesn't hold a candle to this film.Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline, a young girl who, along with her best friend Juliet (Kate Winslet), often envisions herself in fantasy worlds and alternate realities. The two girls' parents become so worried about their fantasies that they separate the two girls - but, in a fit of rage, Melanie and Juliet plan a dreadful revenge.Most shocking of all is that this story sounds like some lame supernatural thriller that would be on a made-for-TV special, in which the girls share some kind of psychic connection - but it's not like that at all. It's a true story, and it's handled quite delicately.The performances are, for the most part, very good. Winslet shines in one of her earlier performances and displays raw talent.Overall, watching this I couldn't help but be reminded of how talented Peter Jackson used to be, and how lately he has succumbed to making, for lack of a better description, Hollywood shlock. I liked ""Lord of the Rings."" I liked ""King Kong."" But this is better.",Heavenly Creatures
23,lasttimeisaw,Force of Nature,9,30 October 2013,"At the age of 33, before the Hollywood calling, Peter Jackson has already presented the world a fundamentally riveting piece of work in his homeland New Zealand, HEAVENLY CREATURES, an intricate retelling of a horrendous matricide case based on a real story in 1950s, and the felons are two adolescent girls. It is a ""too friendly"" relationship between two schoolgirls albeit their very different background, Paulie (Lynskey) is from a lower class, always sulky and socially outcast, while Juliet (Winslet) is from a British middle class (her father is a college professor and mother is a marriage counselor) with a free-spirited soul, but they share the same pursuit and chimera, the idolatry of Mario Lanza and the aversion of Orson Welles, revel in their fantasies of the Fourth World with plasticine-made characters inhabit in the storybook Borovnia, they become inseparable and any force to tear them apart will stir up trouble which turns out to be lethal and kamikaze.Frenetically shot in the opening sequences, the bloodstained faces of Paulie and Juliet predestine the shocking value of the sordid ending, but runs in parallel is their blithe chasing and cavorting in their most joyful days, they develop a borderline sapphic relationship, but the story doesn't necessarily hinge on their "" unwholesome"" sexuality, in fact, it is way more complicated than sex appeal, the intimate connection between those two girls is a godsend, a telepathic ability which only can be communicated between them, thus anyone else is shut out from their world, and eventually Paulie's mother (Peirse) will fall prey to their delusive freedom. The film is both Lynskey and Winslet's big screen debut, the former recently got a BREAKTHROUGH AWARD nomination in Gotham Awards for HELLO I MUST BE GOING 2012, which is such a laughingstock since her debut work here is a tremendous force of nature and one of the most challenging role for her age, rebelling with a cause, Lynskey competently demonstrates both the evil and the compassionate sides of Paulie. Kinslet is also great, Juliet's superior tone aside, she is a spoiled flower trapped in a dysfunctional family, only when they are together, they can evade the rotten and tedious reality and enjoy the true happiness. The supporting cast is well-selected, most of them are caricatured (i.e. Merrison's pedantic father of Juliet), but Peirse casts a varnish of self-involvement to her otherwise pedestrian role of a nagging-mother- turned-innocent-victim. But it is Peter Jackson, whose expansive imagination works wonders here, one can feasibly detect his predilection to fictitious creations and gory violence, with the aid of DP Alun Bollinger, HEAVENLY CREATURES presents itself as a high-end paradigm of blending drama with surreal constituent, a bona-fide cinematic gem should not be overlooked.",Heavenly Creatures
24,sddavis63,The Story Of A Deadly Friendship,8,31 August 2008,"I was very impressed by this New Zealand-made movie, based on the murder of a woman in Christchurch in 1954. I wondered at first what I was getting into when the movie started with nothing more than a sort of tourist description of Christchurch, but that only takes a couple of minutes (although I never was sure what the point of starting the movie that way was) and after it's over we begin with a scene that grabs the viewer. The movie then never really lets you go.This is the story of two lonely girls - Pauline and Juliet - who develop an unexpected, unusual and finally obsessively intimate relationship lived out within a fantasy world of their own making. While it's perhaps most noteworthy for being a very early piece of work by Kate Winslet (later of ""Titanic"" fame), who played Juliet, I thought that Melanie Lynskey (in her first acting role) was every bit as good as Winslet (probably better, in fact, given that I thought Pauline was a more difficult role) - interesting, given that Winslet has gone on to greater stardom. There were also very good performances from Sarah Peirse as Pauline's mother, Honora, and Diana Kent as Juliet's mother Hilda. I was less taken with Clive Merrison and Simon O'Connor as the two fathers, who - to me - came across more as comic characters.As the story goes, eventually both sets of parents become concerned that the friendship between the two girls has become unhealthy, bordering on a lesbian relationship, and they decide that the girls must be separated for their own good. Juliet is told she'll be moving to South Africa, but the parents (surprisingly, given their concerns and suspicions) agree that they can spend two weeks together before Juliet leaves. During that time they concoct a deadly plan to allow them to stay together. Finally, Pauline's mother takes the girls on an outing for tea and a visit to a park, where the plan is unleashed. The whole thing ends up in a pretty graphic and somewhat disturbing murder scene, in which Sarah Peirse comes across as very believable as the mother under attack from the two girls.The closing captions describe the legal proceedings against the two girls, who were found guilty and sent to separate prisons, eventually to be released on the condition that they never see each other again. Interesting, apparently, that Juliet is apparently now living in Scotland and is known as Anne Perry, an author of murder mysteries, although I've never read any of her books.This is a really well done movie, lacking in Hollywood glitziness (which is a compliment, by the way) and highly recommended to anyone who comes across it. 8/10",Heavenly Creatures
25,bowmanblue,The 'fluffiest' murder movie ever made?,8,22 November 2018,"Back before film-maker Peter Jackson specialised in giant apes and armies of Orcs, believe it or not he actually made some quite low budget little films in his native New Zealand, one of which was destined to almost completely be forgotten due to his eventual rise to mega-fame with his 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy - this little gem being 'Heavenly Creatures.'It's a story that's based on a real-life murder from the fifties that was quite notorious at the time, due to the crime being carried out by a pair of 'sweet and innocent' (?) teenage girls. Kate Winslet makes her debut performance (in films, at least) as one half of the due, Juliet Hulme. It's easy to see this as her 'break-through' role as she does shine with youthful exuberance and it's hard to imagine anyone so angelic-looking could be capable of such misdeeds. Much of the attention surrounding the film centred around Winslet, due to it spring-boarding her career to A-list status. However, it's worth noting that the film may have been totally forgotten at the time had it not been for the excellently-understated (and largely unrecognised at the time) performance by the other girl, Pauline Parker, played by Melanie Lynskey. Lynskey is a true opposite to everything about Winslet's character, in both looks and mannerisms. However, I guess it has something to do with that old saying 'opposites attract' that made the two come together in real life and be so powerful together when portrayed on film.However, as good as the two leads' performances are perhaps this is the early movie that really cemented Jackson's reputation as a director who was definitely one to look out for. Because the two main characters are so you and, because they were living in a time where children were encouraged to act like children (as opposed to today when 11 year olds are posing for pictures on Instagram) they come across as - what you might call - 'overly childlike.' This is, of course, in stark contrast to the crime they go on to commit. They live in a fantasy world (some CGI special effects required here, but it all works well as it's not actually supposed to be real, purely - and very blatantly - in the minds of the girls) and so everything is treated like it was some sort of happy-go-lucky kids' movie. Jackson creates an atmosphere that's brimming with 'cuteness,' while all the time underlying the tension of what is slowly building. If I had to liken it to another film/director, I'd say it was similar to some of the output of David Lynch, who specialises in creating (seemingly) 'idyllic' settings, only for something very dark to be brooding beneath the surface.I think potential viewers need to be aware of how the two leads act before they decide to watch the film. I saw some complaints regarding how 'annoying' the two girls were. As I mentioned, they came from a different time to the one we live in now and children acted differently then. Yes, I know they go to 'extreme' lengths when presented with the reality that some families move away, therefore 'splitting up' friends in the process. However, thinking back to my own 'teenage years' I recall some pretty (hormone-driven?) emotions flooding through me, making me think every little event was the end of the world and no one would ever understand me. Therefore, I do give the two girls a little bit of slack for their feelings (but not their ultimate actions, obviously!).Despite how 'sweet and innocent' this film is, it's definitely not for the faint hearted, as the ending seems to deliberately try and contrast everything that's gone before it in terms of sheer horror and brutality. If you're into drama, real life crime, or just looking for something we a flair for creating an atmosphere, then this is definitely worth a watch. 'Lord of the Rings' it is not, but it is definitely one of Peter Jackson's finest. Oh, and if you heard it's full of 'lesbian action,' you're in for a disappointment - that's barely part of the film at all.",Heavenly Creatures
26,secondtake,Loosely imagined (good) and loosely constructed (not so good)...sensationalism!,7,15 June 2010,"Heavenly Creatures (1994)Peter Jackson fans (and Lord of the Rings fans) both might find this film breathtaking and astonishing for its raw telling of events and its inventive twists. It does move quickly through a series of different stages of the relationship between two girls, beginning and ending with a horrible event that caps it all off. And it has some surreal and technically quasi-animation (claymation) sections that are interesting, at least.But it's a clunky film, forcing sensational issues on us, and rather too many of them, really, because it feels as though button-pushing is the goal. Think of the core of the film--two high school age girls living in New Zealand have such an obsessive bond they are driven to madness and murder. Their contrasting families (stuffy and cultured vs. middle class and real), the girls private school rigidity, and the beautiful landscape make for rich stuff to work with. Add a reasonable decision to try to depict their inner thoughts through imaginative dream scenes, and even throw in a hint of teenage lesbianism, which is probably as common as coffeecake in Christchurch. You should have a searing, disturbing, beautiful, memorable movie.And some of you think I've nailed it. I get that. I also get that it garnered some awards here and there in 1994. But for me the effects, including the over-dramatic first scene with all its blood and interlayering from black and white to color, is just pushy movie-making. From there one there is a similar stretching of ideas, and even a stretching of the film, which after all is a linear plot the way it is told here, of two girls and their decline. There is some realistic acting that gives it strength (the two mothers in particular) but much of the acting is also pushy and exaggerated, including the clearly inspired job by a young (18 year old) Kate Winslet in her first full film role. Call it stylized.As much as some scenes are really gripping and commanding, the whole movie, taken scene after scene, is sloppy and indulgent. It might push you out of the movie, the way it did me, so that you feel outside the experience looking in. Maybe even a bit impatiently. A footnote: both girls got five years in juvenile prison. The English one (the Winslet one) is now a mystery writer living in Scotland. The other (whose mother died) is also now living in Scotland (in a more remote area). Life goes on.",Heavenly Creatures
27,Irishchatter,A movie full of fantasy,9,24 August 2015,"I have to say this movie was dark as the dark ages and the strangest i have ever came across.Although I have to say it was sad that two girls had such lonely lives even without each other. All they thought about was to get into the other world and be happy. They are pretty much loners, that was why it triggered them to fantasy and of course, planning to kill Pauline's mother just so the girls won't be separated again.I swear, this can be hard to watch! I mean, Pauline and Juliet were very intelligent ordinary girls but it really went downhill for them in the end. It is too bad that back in the 50's, they didn't mention what homosexuality truly is. They could've least looked into more but of course, stupid doctors or scientists as well as therapists weren't moving their backsides at all.

She has no friends at an exclusive girls' school, which her struggling parents can barely afford. They take in boarders, for Pauline is bright. One momentous day, Paul's class gets a new student, imaginative Juliet (Kate Winslet), who is wealthy, intelligent, creative and outspoken. Because Juliet, too, has weak lungs and spent 5 years separated from her family in a warmer climate, the girls have a bond that begins a close friendship. Both girls love Mario Lanza and play-acting. In fact, they envision their own special heaven called The Fourth World, which has knights, princesses, and an elaborate landscape. Both the well-to-do family of Juliet and the poor one of Pauline are extremely concerned about the closer-than-close ties between the two girls. There are other family secrets afoot, too, which eventually result in Juliet's family planning to move away and in Pauline's mother taking steps to separate the girls. But, this results in a tragedy beyond comprehension for two young ladies driven into madness by their own imaginations and strong wills. This amazing film is one for the ages. Not only are the two young performers, Winslet and Lynskey, touching and horrifying beyond their years. but the creative landscapes, real and imagined, are superlative.

30,Red-125,Kate Winslet's debut in a bizarre--but true--crime story,8,12 October 2016,"Heavenly Creatures (1994) is a New Zealand film co-written and directed by Peter Jackson.The film stars Melanie Lynskey as Pauline Parker, and Kate Winslet as Juliet Hulme. In 1954, in what was famous as the Parker-Hulme murder, the two teenage friends brutally murdered Parker's mother. The case would have been a sensation at any time and in any place, but in 1950's New Zealand, it was beyond belief.The movie starts with the two girls, with blood all over them, running and screaming up to an ice cream stand in a park. As we learn, they are Parker and Hulme. They have just bludgeoned Parker's mother with a brick. In that sense, the rest of the movie is a flashback. It begins with the murder and ends with the murder. Apparently, nobody knows to this day why the two girls acted the way they did.The film is essentially a docudrama. The movie follows the facts that are known about the case. Parker kept a diary, which, of course, the police found when they investigated. They were then able to clearly identify the girls as the murderers, but they also obtained information about the elaborate, detailed fantasy world the young women had developed.Both women--in real life--have said that they weren't lesbians. However, their behavior was interpreted to mean that they were lesbians. At the time, lesbianism was officially considered a serious mental disorder. However, in the film, a doctor says that although they are acting like lesbians, ""they'll grow out of it.""Winslet is the more elegant and beautiful of the girls, so we look at her first. Of course, we now know that three years later she is going to star in Titanic. I believe that Lynskey is an equally good actor. She has achieved success as a character actor. However, she didn't star in Titanic, and she didn't win an Oscar or receive a CBE. That's show business.It was hard to enjoy this film because it was obvious from the beginning that something horrible was going to happen, and, if you knew the case, you knew what that something was. The movie was brilliantly photographed and directed, the supporting roles were well cast and well acted, and every film buff wants to see the movie in which Kate Winslet began her career.In that sense, it's a must-see movie. I recommend this film, but with the caveat that you won't walk away whistling the theme song. It's tough to watch. The girls are so out of control, and their motivation is so bizarre, that you'll end up wondering how it could really have happened.We saw this film projected from an original 35mm nitrate print at the excellent Dryden Theatre of the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY. It's wonderful to see movies in this way, but the film will work almost as well on the small screen. The movie was shown as part of ImageOut, the outstanding Rochester LGBT Film Festival.",Heavenly Creatures

32,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Only the best people fight against all obstacles in the pursuit of happiness.""",9,29 May 2008,"Besides being, to me, a fascinating although eccentric look at an example of every day life in 1950s New Zealand (one of only two or three places in the world that I have wanted to visit all my life), Heavenly Creatures is also the first movie that really shows that talent of Peter Jackson, which may have been overshadowed in his previous career by the sheer quantity of blood and guts that he packed into his earliest films. I have read that a lot of people were initially put off by the premise of an intense loving relationship between two teenage girls, but it should be noted that their relationship, if sexual at all, is sexual in a purely symbolic way. If nothing else, Jackson has made a stupendous achievement of making a film about this relationship and completely preventing any sense of eroticism from creeping up. The movie tells the shocking true story of two teenage girls who crushed the skull of one of their mothers with a rock, and what led them to commit such a heinous crime. My understanding is that the story is told with a great deal of creative liberties, but the focus is on a kind of friendship that few people ever find. Two girls with strengths and weaknesses that perfectly complement each other, who run through the world at full speed giggling with glee as if unable to understand the pure happiness that they feel when they are together. Soon, various events come in the way of their friendship. Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline, and Kate Winslet, in her first film role, plays Juliet, who is noticeably horrified when her parents bring up the prospect of leaving the country for a mere three weeks. While separated, they write each other elaborate letters, describing events that take place in an imaginary world that they have created together. When the separations become longer (and more obviously because of parents' misguided (?) concerns about a homosexual relationship), their efforts to remain together become more and more desperate. As they say, never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers, or even the power and danger of a couple of teenage girls bent on maintaining their friendship. People are dangerous in groups, even groups of two (I realize, just this second, that tomorrow morning I have three classes of university students preparing to give final exam presentations in groups of two and three. I hope I haven't made a horrible mistake!!). Complicating matters for Pauline and Juliet are four wildly unhelpful parents. Juliet's mother is distracted by her disintegrating marriage and futile affairs while her professional father is benevolent and professional but both hapless and helpless, while Pauline's mother is over- controlling and militant about her discipline, and her father seems to just want the whole thing to go away. The parents and the children are pulling in opposite directions, and they pull harder and harder and harder until finally the rope snaps, as it must. There are a number of truly impressive and memorable sections of the film, such as the presentation of the imaginary world that Pauline and Juliet have created together, particularly the clay characters that populate it. These things make it a movie that is difficult to categorize but easy to remember, and they show a sense of visual style that Jackson later went on to develop even further in the Lord of the Rings films and King Kong. Some say that he will never be able to top the Lord of the Rings movies, but personally I think he still has a few things up his sleeve. We can hope, anyway.Note  it's well known that the real life Juliet has been revealed to be the successful murder mystery novelist Anne Perry, which is a perfect ending to her story (although I would have expected Pauline to become the writer). Also, Melanie Lynksey has had a surprisingly successful acting career, appearing in many successful films, including a periodic role as the slightly crazy but immensely attractive Rose on 2 ½ Men.",Heavenly Creatures

34,freemantle_uk,An excellent drama,9,1 January 2013,"We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of.In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder.Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning.On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies.There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches.Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn.If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.",Heavenly Creatures

No ""Heavenly Creatures"" In This Movie-From-Hell",3,21 February 2014,"*Possible Spoilers Ahead!* If you're looking for a real ""ding-dong"" demented, teen, lesbian love-story movie (with a truly laughable murder, thrown in for good measure), then Heavenly Creatures (HC) is your one-way ticket to the 5th dimension of sheer, grate-on-your-nerves wackiness.I really don't know where to begin expressing my total disappointment over this utterly preposterous, unbelievably irksome and decidedly over-rated Chick Flick from 1994.But, I'll tell you one thing for certain, I found that I could not relate, in any way, shape, or form, with what went on between these 2 flaky teens, even if I tried.And, what's even worse, the life-sized, clay figures that inevitably dominated Pauline & Juliet's freaked-out fantasy-world looked so absolutely dumb that I found I couldn't take this sort of nuttiness in the least bit serious. And I couldn't imagine anyone who could.Had I been able to take something of a genuine liking towards the Parker/Hulme characters, then, yes, that would have made a whole world of difference when it came to my appreciation (or lack of) for HC.But, between poor-girl Parker's dead-serious impersonation of ""Droopy"" and rich-girl Hulme's flighty take on ""Olive Oyl"", I found these 2 (who were forever hand-in-hand and (unconvincingly) gushing over each other) to be about as irritating a pair of lovers (be they gay or straight) that I've had to endure in any movie in a mighty long time.As well - Neither actress Melanie Lynskey nor Kate Winslet even came close in their character portrayals to convincing me that they were both supposed to be the age of 14 years.Anyways - When it finally came down to Pauline & Juliet actually getting around to committing their nasty, little murder (which, of course, was a helluva lot more bloody than it was believable), I had grown so frickin' sick & tired of HC's non-stop nonsense that I couldn't have cared less about it, one way, or the other.(Ho-Hum!) P.S.The one scene in HC that really killed me was when Juliet came barging into her parents' bedroom only to encounter her mom being shagged (rather listlessly) by a close, family friend.With this moment, obviously, being very tense and uncomfortable, all that Juliet could think of was to verbally threaten her mother with blackmail and demand that she pay her 100 pounds to keep silent and not tell dear, old dad about it.Yeah. I know that this scene doesn't sound like much, but, hey, just like the rest of this film, it was handled very insensitively and, in return, it came across as being totally laughable instead of as it was intended - Dead serious.",Heavenly Creatures

This was boring and very pompous, so as a drama it was average as a thriller is was a disaster. If you like dramas with added artsy fartsy crap here's your film. If you want a thriller watch seven or maybe the usual suspects or fight club, but this is a bore. I like peter Jackson but he can go off the track ie king Kong.",Heavenly Creatures
37,rooprect,I saw this in the theater when it came out and thought meh. 25 years later I'm like OMG BRILLIANT,8,26 April 2019,"This film may take a while to sink in (for me it took 25 years), so don't expect to be absolutely riveted, spellbound, rapturous, or blown away in a sea of brilliance like a lot of the superlative critics' reviews may lead you to believe. Instead, if you decide to watch this, take it for what it is and let it sink in.That said, it is truly a well designed film. Based on the true events in 1954 New Zealand of a pair of 15 year old girls who hatch a diabolical scheme (which I won't spoil in case you have no idea of the backstory), this creative telling takes us through the off-kilter reality of the two teen girls Pauline & Juliet as they indulge their fantasy imaginations to the point that it becomes... well... watch the movie.As the story progresses and the 2 girls dive deeper into their imagined world, the film becomes more surreal, frequently escaping into complete fantasy territory with castles, unicorns and homicidal princes made of clay. Special effects are basic but very effective. And the result is a story that's thoroughly engaging both with its writing as well as its visual presentation.The acting is stellar featuring a debut performance by Kate Winslet, age 18, as ""Juliet"". Her counterpart ""Pauline"" was played by Melanie Lynskey who was 16 at the time and did a great job of bringing to life the rather amoral problem child who evolves from introversion into outright psychopathy.But don't expect too many scares, jumps, action and exploding helicopters because like I said, this is a subtle film. And I give it huge points for the way it handled violence in a very disturbing, NON-glorifying way. Seriously, after seeing that scene you'll want to retire any violent criminal plans you may have and instead take up poetry or something. Its' quite upsetting (and rightfully so) which is something very few filmmakers can achieve.I highly recommend this film to be watched twice. Let it sink in. The second time will really be the charm.",Heavenly Creatures
38,Boyo-2,Fascinating treatment of real-life events,9,19 June 2001,"What a well-done, memorable movie this is.  Even if there is nothing much going on, there is an undercurrent of...insanity.  I was never sure when either of the girls was going to go off her nut and for what reason, because they seem to have been that way when they were alone - together they were two times as lethal.  Their imaginery world of knights and kings and undying love was consistent with their slightly off-balance existence.  Movie contains some gorgeous cinematography and I enjoyed hearing Mario Lanza too!A credit to all involved.  I can see why this movie is so admired. 9/10.",Heavenly Creatures
39,Spleen,"Yes, well. Yet another unremarkable Australasian film manages to attract rave reviews.",5,7 August 2000,"I often suspect it's because of a kind of subconscious cultural relativism: ""I must find SOME film from Australia or New Zealand to praise to the skies; otherwise I'm left with the conclusion that Australasian cinema is inferior to that of America, Asia and Europe; and we can't have that.""  Well - why not?I'm the last person who wants to say that ""Heavenly Creatures"" is bad.  An intense - ferocious - friendship between two young teenaged girls ends in their jointly committing a murder; it's not a bad story, and Jackson succeeds in making sympathise with the two girls even while we see how potentially destructive their friendship is.  So it's a good movie.  But great?  Don't be absurd.For one thing, the computer-generated effects - the means by which we're allowed a glimpse into the girls' fantasy world - are cheesy and unattractive.  I've heard a number of excuses offered for this, all more or less sophisticated versions of, ""Yes, but they're meant to be.""  I'm never very impressed with that defence.  I don't see why WE have to endure bland, unmagical fantasy visions just because Jackson has taken it into his head to make some point about how the girls have a shallow conception of reality, or some such.  (If THIS is Jackson's point, one might respond with a tu quoque. He's a little too willing to portray the adults - the school staff in particular - as unconvincing buffoons, if you ask me.)  Besides, the fact that the fantasy visions fall flat prevents us from seeing things EITHER as they are OR as they appear to the girls.And while I found the film refreshingly free from sensationalism for the most part, I'm afraid I had to revise that assessment when I saw the murder itself.  Not so much because of the way it was filmed; rather, because it's the last thing we see.  It's as if Jackson is saying, ""You wanted a murder, didn't you?  Well, here it is; and now that we've got to the juicy bit, my work is done.""  But it wasn't.  Jackson failed to satisfy our desire to see what happens next for no better reason than that it pleased him to do so. We're told, by a title-card announcement, that the girls were in the end allowed to go free on condition they never meet again; now THAT, surely, is the most important part of the whole story, and we read about it on a title card.  It's less of a cliché than a title card reading, ""And they all lived happily ever after"", but no less bad art.Apart from these two flaws the film is, as I said earlier, good, involving, and unremarkable.",Heavenly Creatures
40,Amyth47,From Peter Jackson's canon comes a fantasy-fairytale based on a true-crime story.,7,7 July 2019,"My Rating : 7/10Kate Winslet's debut feature directed by the one and only Peter Jackson. Kate Winslet's outrageous persona along with the idiosyncrasies of Peter Jackson make 'Heavenly Creatures' an interesting true-crime tale from down under New Zealand.'Heavenly Creatures' is dreamy, romantic, innocent and wild. While not a lesbian affair, it is more akin to an obsessive platonic relationship that both protagonists equally participated in and developed into a fantasy world of their own to do as they willed.Fairytale for adults.",Heavenly Creatures
41,raulfaust,When the creature is lurking inside you,6,7 February 2015,"Juliet and Pauline are two girls that become very good friends in a brief period of time, and I couldn't, exactly, understand why. Winslet's character is an arrogant teenager that enjoys being seen as the smartest one. Pauline, on the other hand, seems to be some ordinary girl with some strong anger towards her parents, and the plot never really reveals the reason for it. She's also a naive girl when it comes to sex, which can be noticed in the scenes she shares with an older boy. Even thought a lot of people considered it to be a great film, I didn't like it that much. In my opinion, the plot is too slow and contrived, reason why I felt bored during almost all the way through. However, I'm gonna admit that the final scenes are surprisingly intense and hard to be seen, but that's the only ""great"" moment in the whole picture. ""Titanic"" was really a better choice for Kate Winslet...",Heavenly Creatures
42,Sandcooler,Hits the spot,9,22 February 2009,"Maybe I'm just getting mellow, but I was really overwhelmed by how beautiful this movie looked. Especially when we find our protagonists in the hallucinated dream world or whatever you call it, it had that kind of surreal touch I'm really into. Peter Jackson generally is just good at filming stuff. That climax is really good too, it's just all sorts of emotions, and you ask yourself how you personally would want the story to end. Especially the mother was kind of a complicated character to me, just don't know what to think of her. This movie is also noteworthy because it's the screen debut of Kate Winslet, who as some might guess is doing really well. She could be the best actress of her generation. I don't know that much about the other lead, but I do love her narration. Overall, I'm just kind of ashamed I didn't feel like watching this sooner. This beautiful thing has left quite an impression on me, not in the least because of the grim ending frames. In conclusion, it's pretty great.",Heavenly Creatures
43,lewiskendell,Peter Jackson'a most successful early movie.,6,11 December 2010,"""The next time I write in this diary, mother will be dead. How odd, yet how pleasing.""This early writing and directorial effort by Peter Jackson and starring a young Kate Winslet is an odd one to pin down. Especially odd, since it's based on a true story (which I didn't know until the film was over). It's about the intense friendship between two girls living in New Zealand. One is sullen and withdrawn, the other, a wealthy transplant from England, is outspoken and draws attention with her very presence. Both are intelligent, imaginative, and share a similar casual darkness in their personalities. As their friendship blooms and grows more and more intense, their parents (this being set in the 50's) begin to suspect an unwholesome aspect to their relationship. When the threat of separation arises, the girls swiftly and resolutely settle on a grisly solution to their forced division: murder.The movie shifts in tone often, from a sort of coming of age story, to the fanciful world of the girls' imaginations, to their rage and heartbreak at their parents. Kate Winslet was pretty good, but you could tell that she was still finding her way and confidence as an actress. I found the plot to be rather dull at the start, but it grew more interesting as it continued on to a rather abrupt ending. Interesting is a good word to use describe Heavenly Creatures, as a whole. It held my attention, even during the parts where I was a little less than entertained. It's unflinchingly dark in some aspects, and innocent and childlike in others. I'd recommend it to most just based on the fact that it's something different, and there's merit in that. It's well-made, also, I just found my interest fluctuating too often to give the movie a higher score. And how does Kate Winslet look almost exactly the same today as she did in 1994? Now that's a topic that's interesting enough to make a movie about.",Heavenly Creatures
44,Lady_Targaryen,"This movie is polemic,strong and yet great.",10,20 November 2005,"Based in a real story, Heavenly Creatures has the great direction of Peter Jackson years before Lord of the Rings become a success. Pauline Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme, are two teenager girls in the 50's, a very conservative time. Juliet is from the upper class,already traveled around the world, and comes from England to study in the same Conservative catholic school as Pauline, a girl from a lower class, with an anti social behavior and moody. They two become close friends,specially because they both have many similarities: They don't have any friends, they had a hard childhood,needing to be in the hospital with special cares because of their diseases ( Juliet with tuberculosis and Pauline with poliomyelitis)they both enjoy operas and have a lot of creativity. Pauline starts to like Juliet's lifestyle and nice warm family, the life of a upper class where they have freedom to go out together to movie theaters and at the beach (different from her mother Honorah, who was always annoying her,and making her help washing the dishes,cleaning the house and help in the pension). Juliet for the other hand, a pretty and intelligent girl,liked the way Pauline was always giving attention to her and her stories, besides being always there for Juliet,giving her a support.(different from her family, who were always traveling for many places and letting her alone. In her childhood during the war, Juliet says that she was sent to a hospital in the Bahamas to take care of her tuberculosis, being 5 years without seeing her entire family!) Their friendship becomes even stronger and they were so immersed into each other that it became impossible for them to imagine their existence without the other's presence.But some problems starts to begin: Juliet stay sick again with tuberculosis, making the girls being distant. Juliet's dad and mom are going to get a divorce. Dr. Henry Hulme starts to notice how close his daughter and Pauline were,with intimacies like sharing the same bed, taking bath together and being closed in the room all the time with their stories and ideas. Pauline's mother Honorah was worried as well, even taking Pauline to a psychologist, where she is analyzed with homosexuality.Then, life for them turns into a hell, with Honorah always fighting and arguing with Pauline ,not letting her stay too close to Juliet, and this one, for the other hand, needing to be sent to south Africa because of the tuberculosis. Afraid of their separation, the story has a tragic and sad ending, with both girls killing Honorah (who in their imagination was the 'problem'to be solved. Pauline thinks that if she kills her mother,she can go with Juliet to South Africa) and going to the jail, where they could never see each other again.",Heavenly Creatures
45,DeeNine-2,Kate Winslet at 18,8,26 January 2000,"Christchurch, New Zealand, 1952: two school girls become friends and swoon over Mario Lanza, ""world's greatest tenor,"" as they create a fantasy world of royalty and intense emotional attachment to one another. This is teen escapism carried to the nth degree. Innocence and wholesome fun do NOT prevail. As the parents grow increasingly concerned about their daughters' obsessive relationship, the girls begin to hate the parents... Based on a rather shocking (for its time) true story. Kate Winslet made her film debut in this modest comédie noire from way down under. It is amazing to realize that three years later she starred in the Academy Award winning Titanic (1998), on her way to establishing herself as one of the most charismatic and talented stars of the past decade. In retrospect, her budding talent is apparent here as the spinning, laughing, crazy teen who went off the deep end emotionally. There is no mistaking the sharp, confident and commanding Winslet style. Despite the part, Kate looks as wholesome and delicious as apple pie with cherry vanilla ice cream, yet manages to convey the demented edge necessary to the role.Full-figured and brooding Melanie Lynskey is intriguing and not easily forgotten as Kate's manic/depressive friend. Director Peter Jackson is to be commended for getting the most out of the girls, and for making their fantasy world believable. We can imagine how they fell into it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

46,wisewebwoman,Kate Winslet's debut performance,7,29 October 2005,"Long before The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Peter Jackson directed the true story of two schoolgirls living in New Zealand in the early fifties who commit a horrendous crime. This movie is called 'Heavenly Creatures' and stars Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). They form the kind of intense friendship that only two fourteen-year-old oddballs can form. Both have a history of health issues and solitary hospitalizations and are exempt from what passes as P.E. in those days.Together the girls encourage each other's rebellions against the conventions of their convent school and on the way Juliet gets involved in Pauline's writing. Through the writing they create an alternative world, very well depicted in the movie. This is a world of knights and ladies in distress where they both inhabit fictional personalities. This is a story about best friends with an element of sensual and sexual awakening but never does the viewer get the impression this is about lesbians. Threaded throughout, to add further appeal is the singing and fictionalization of Mario Lanza singing his 'hits' and also the movie 'The Third Man'  an Orson Welles classic  which continually underlines the almost surreal atmosphere the girls have created.The final scene shot with Madama Butterfly's Humming Chorus running through it is completely haunting and stayed in my mind long after.One enters this difficult world of Pauline and Juliet only through the skill of a gifted director and Peter Jackson does an amazing job of creating all the worlds embodied in this movie and also capturing the almost imperceptible descent into the madness of thinking that a horrendous crime could be executed without trace. Pauline's diary is threaded throughout and this is the means by which their guilt becomes known to the authorities.Some of the film is beautiful and at times lyrical but the layers of disturbance are never far away.I gave it 7.5 out of 10. It would have been more but I found the ending too abrupt, though the notes on what happened subsequent to the movie were informative. The writer Anne Perry turns out to be the Juliet of the film and Pauline teaches riding to children somewhere in England and is a devout Catholic in atonement for her crime. The girls never saw each other again.",Heavenly Creatures
47,pyrocitor,"Stark, vivid and harrowing; all the more unsettling through its honest emotional empathy",9,22 December 2008,"There is an odd societal catharsis film viewers seem to achieve through the billing ""based on a true story"", as if by watching the cinematic re-creation of emotionally raw subject matter, further truth may be extracted from the circumstances or social closure may be obtained. This theory becomes skewed by the average cinematic use of the term, as many Hollywood productions simply take the ""true events"" tag as a framework for mainstream exploitation of real tragedies for entertainment purposes. But then there are films like Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, which take potentially combustive subject matter, and rather than exploiting it for sensationalist entertainment, actually make a genuine attempt to mine the situation for emotional truth and nuance, taking a gruesome tragedy and turning it into a transcendent emotional portrait, all the more astonishing in the process. While Heavenly Creatures might have ended up a routinely melodramatic albeit morbid thriller, the endless innovations and quirks of director Peter Jackson transform the unsettling story into something infinitely more compelling. Unlike the majority of such cinematic murder mysteries, geared around cheap shocks and a consistently building sense of tension, Jackson's film is a true rarity through his willingness to allow the viewer to enter into the minds of his protagonists, sharing their dreamlike euphoria and hysteric fantasy world. What makes Heavenly Creatures truly eerie and unsettling is the intoxicating sense of delirious happiness throughout, evoking discomfort not from overly contrived ominous foreshadowing but from aligning the viewer with the characters depicted (with unsettling use of extracts from the diary entries of the real life Pauline), demonstrating their mental fragility in a compassionate but uncomfortably credible fashion, making the abrupt shift to visceral realism and violence all the more jarring and emotionally devastating. The uneasy immersion is aided by the enormous amount of care and attention devoted to visualizing the girls' fantasy world, exquisitely realized by pre-Lord of the Rings fame Weta workshop's brilliant character and set design, making a realm of 'clay people' come alive with commendable humanity and immediacy, while never abandoning the fantastic trappings, powerfully backed by the soaring musical score of Peter Dasent. Such attention to detail and moments of welcome humour (the girls' strange fixation with Orson Welles) makes empathy with characters who could have been dismissed as a pair of deranged psychotics in the hands of a less sensitive director becomes not only possible but almost inescapable. Jackson contrasts the relationship between the two girls with his candid portrait of repressive 1950s New Zealand, revelling in the delights of a much needed friendship fraught with honest emotion and imagination (while leaving ambiguous overtones as to the proximity of their relationship), before subtly increasing the tension, transposing the intensity from joyful to uncomfortable and subsequently manipulating the viewer's emotions to a disconcerting degree. The remarkable premise is truly brought to life by the astonishing performances of the two leads, both making their motion picture debuts, yet delivering more disturbingly powerful performances than most critically acclaimed actresses twice their age. The utter humanity both coax into their roles despite the sinister overtones makes the viewer's heart break, seeing the two not as monsters but as tragically mislead adolescents grasping desperately for companionship but getting carried away. As Pauline, Melanie Lynskey gives a performance of vastly further complexity, breadth and believability than the average cinematic social misfit child, her softly wounded expression hinting at the turmoil underneath and her diary voiceovers are truly stunning and chilling. Kate Winslet is similarly stunning as Juliet, her slow transition from defiant rich girl to being hysterically transfixed by her fantasy world is a truly masterful one, hinting at the superb performances yet to come. Sarah Peirse also delivers a fantastic performance as Pauline's compassionate yet traditionally repressive mother, and Peirse thankfully resists the temptation to make her character an outright villain but merely an honest human being bound by social conventions and concern for her daughter.Few films striving at such daring aims as Heavenly Creatures are met with such success: not quite a biopic and hardly a murder mystery, but more of an honest portrait of a genuine friendship between two lost souls, whose intensity grows to potentially out of hand dimensions, all the while refusing to sensationalize the inevitable tragedy. Fuelled by the simply stunning performances of the two promising young actresses and Jackson's quirkily irrelevant yet vividly accurate direction, the film proves a perfect example of masterfully wrenching emotional storytelling, one worth examining for any in search of a draining yet fundamentally human drama.-9/10",Heavenly Creatures
48,sharky_55,All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases. It's all frightfully romantic.,9,30 December 2015,"Kate Winslet is Juliet Hulme, a bright eyed schoolgirl with golden locks, a radiant smile, and a British accent that makes her stunningly exotic, or at least to the strictly Catholic New Zealand school. Melanie Lynskey is Pauline Parker, whose hair is almost as dark as her glare, and whom no doubt wishes she could exchange her thick New Zealand accent for something a bit striking and otherworldly. These are two girls who would not normally be drawn to each other, but because of medical conditions, find themselves a close friendship. Jackson indicates the blossoming of this by letting the debut actresses act, and be teenage girls; after the first conversation, Paul hurries home, dodging her mother's question to put on a new record - Mario Lanza, the world's greatest tenor, and her blissful reaction is all we need to know. They are both terrific performances and scream children instead of actresses reading lines in each little symptom of girls lost in their own worlds; the mocking tones in which Juliet mimics a 'friend' of her mother's, the way Paul drops her head into her hands whenever she is embarrassed by her father singing into a fish or her mother welcoming a boarder, how they skip together hand in hand and giggle and laugh endlessly in their own imagination. The visual effects, which are noticeably dated, seem to fit quite well with the context. When they first visualise the Fourth World, the mundane New Zealand is physically wiped away in swathes for the idyllic gardens and unicorns and giant butterflies, and a golden glow bathes their playtime. It does not look fluid or smooth, but transforms itself in the same way in which a child's mind unlocks little segments of their daydreams. The soundtrack tinkles along, Mario Lanza serenades, and the camera weaves and swoops its way through the air like the outstretched arms that they have exchanged for aeroplane wings, and swivels around in excitement. A show-tune could easily be dropped in here, and the whole scene could insert itself into Mary Poppins without a touch of difference. When they build a sandcastle, they lovingly craft intricate details and a storyline to match, and the camera makes itself tiny and matches each gallop of the sound design as it tours the majestic building, matching their vivid imagination. Only later, as the Fourth World leaks into the real, does the sound become more menacing; as irritations are beheaded and gutted for upsetting the creator. Aside from those bursts of imaginative violence (which all of us have had once in a while, even as adults - but this films takes it further), Jackson subtly imbues the real world with a haunting, suffocating quality, as if the girl's dreamland has begun to affect how they see reality, and how little they want to return to it. When a pastor offers up a pamphlet emblazoned with Jesus, there is a loud whoosh, dramatising how horrifying this confrontation must be, before a clay figure drags him away for execution. An extreme closeup likewise does the same to evil word the doctor theorises, a taboo back in the 50s. But I think it is much more than just physical love that they share; it is something much stronger. When Paul goes in search of the latter, the camera hovers over a backyard full of junk, and she is presented, climbed the railing, as some sort of prince to a Rapunzel, or a Romeo to a Juliet, in search of that romance in vain. That search leads her back to Juliet, who descends the staircase while the score crescendos in a gown and manner gracefully reminiscent of Cinderella, and Paul's face is awash with a sensual red glow. Harsh green light seems to constantly leak in through the windows, creating a sickly aura that seems to chase the girls and wind down the time they have together. When they are in separate beds, Selkirk hovers over the back of a nurse and smoothly connects the pair through their letters, and then the red and blue glows merge into each other so gorgeously, and they spend the night. All the while, Paul's diary voice-over narrates, and gives us insight into this relationship. It covers every thing from the childhood trivialities to the passionate moments, and is spoken with such a haughty distaste for the real and a wondrous longing for the imaginary. It almost seems normal and consequential when those shocking words are finally dropped: remove mother. This is the film's crowning achievement: to immerse us into Paul and Juliet's world, to make it so seductive, to make themselves so unconditionally necessary to each other, and then to slip in something so trivial, like murder. And it almost manages to convince us it is justified.",Heavenly Creatures
49,jhclues,"""Heavenly"" Indeed",8,15 April 2001,"The true story of two teenaged girls living in New Zealand in the early 50s, `Heavenly Creatures,' directed by Peter Jackson, is a riveting, sometimes intense drama that examines the fast friendship between Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), and the effects of that friendship, on not only themselves, but on their families and friends as well.  From a working class family, at fourteen, Pauline was shy and prone to introspection, recording her most intimate thoughts daily in a diary.  Originally from England, Juliet was the new girl in town; from a well-to-do family, she was well traveled, her father a professor of some stature.  Gregarious and outgoing, she was also given to flights of fancy, all of which appealed to Pauline immediately.  Brash and vivacious, Juliet was everything Pauline would never be; and Pauline was writing a novel, an endeavor in which Juliet quickly joined her.  Together, they would write and act out their romantic notions of brave knights and fair ladies, and Juliet shared with Pauline her knowledge of `The Fourth World,' a place to which she would one day go instead of heaven.  By the time they were fifteen, they were virtually inseparable.  They were `best' friends in every sense of the word.	Director Jackson does a magnificent job of taking you into the world of Pauline and Juliet.  By contrasting the reality with the fantasy, he gives you an excellent sense of what they were all about, how they related to one another (as well as to others), and most importantly, their collective mind set which enabled them to actually embark upon their chosen path.  the girls' dream world is presented with a lyrical style that makes the happy times uplifting, and enhances the impact when things turn dark.  Throughout the film, passages are read verbatim from Pauline's diaries, which adds such stark realism to the events as they unfold, that in the end it produces a veritable sense of awe.  To see the things depicted here in a movie is one thing, but when you stop and think about the fact that two such `normal' young girls were capable of doing what they did, it is indeed sobering.  And when you learn what finally became of Pauline and Juliet, it merely adds to the incredulity of it all.	This film marked the screen debuts of Winslet and Lynskey, and in Winslet's case, this film could have been subtitled `A Star Is Born.'  From the opening frames, in which her talent, beauty and charismatic screen presence are readily apparent, there was no doubt as to the direction her career would soon be taking.  In retrospect, this was a great role with which to jump start her career, and she grabbed the opportunity with both hands and created a truly memorable character, using her natural poise and charm to the ultimate effect.  Winslet not only played the character, she discovered the spirit that moved Juliet and used it to the fullest extent to bring her to life here.  It's a genuinely auspicious and incredible performance.	That Lynskey hasn't fared as well in her career as Winslet has since this film was made is in no way a reflection upon her performance in it.  Pauline is perfectly realized by Lynskey, but due to the more solemn nature of the character, it was almost as if she was predestined to be overshadowed here by Winslet.  But the credit for making the on screen relationship between the girls work so well, and the fact that it is so believable, has to be distributed equally between the two actresses.  And it was Lynskey's ability to evoke and surround herself with an ambience of darkness that allowed Winslet's light to shine so brightly.  	The supporting cast includes Sarah Peirse (Honora), Diana Kent (Hilda), Clive Merrison (Henry), Simon O'Connor (Herbert), Jed Brophy (John), Peter Elliott (Bill), Gilbert Goldie (Dr. Bennett) and Kirsti Ferry (Wendy). Watching such extraordinary circumstances being played out so matter-of-factly by such seemingly ordinary people can be a thought provoking experience, but in the case of `Heavenly Creatures,' it's profoundly disturbing.  There's nothing quite so jarring as realizing the facility with which certain boundaries can in fact be traversed, and when it happens, it's like a slap in the face from reality.  And that's what this film does.  It's an engrossing tale that will prick up the hairs on your neck of awareness, and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark.  I rate this one 8/10.",Heavenly Creatures
50,ajs-10,Loved his one from Peter Jackson Based on a true story!...,9,18 December 2011,"This film is based on a true story; it chronicles the events leading up to a murder in 1954, New Zealand. It's the story of a very close friendship formed between two teenage girls and how it lead to murder. Ever since I saw the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy I have always been looking out for other works directed by Peter Jackson. This one has come up several times in discussions and so I was very pleased when the BBC gave it an airing earlier this week. Here's a brief plot summary before I give you my thoughts.We begin in Canterbury, New Zealand, 1953 where Juliet Hulme has arrived at her new school from England. She forms a friendship with Pauline Parker, an impressionable girl who shares her love of the opera singer, Mario Lanza. They quickly form a strong bond, one that is made stronger by the fact that they both have had bad illnesses in the past. They begin writing stories about a fantasy land with various colourful characters. They re-enact scenes from the stories and eventually this fantasy land becomes real to them. Their parents become worried that their friendship is becoming too intense. As events unfold, it transpires that Juliet's parents are planning to divorce and she is to be shipped out to an aunt in South Africa. This hit's Pauline hard and, because she has been having a particularly hard time with her mother, they hatch a plot to get her out of the way. I can't say any more or the spoiler police will be escorting me down a country path.It's all beautifully shot with some really great CGI in the fantasy scenes; I can now see just why Jackson was chosen for those other films he made later. Great performances from both of the starring actresses. I thought Melanie Lynskey was really excellent as Pauline Parker and, in her first movie role, Kate Winslet did a first-rate job as Juliet Hulme. Honourable mentions must also go to; Sarah Peirse as Honora Parker Rieper, Diana Kent as Hilda Hulme, Clive Merrison as Dr. Henry Hulme, Simon O'Connor as Herbert Rieper and Jed Brophy as John/Nicholas.Peter Jackson pays great attention to detail and it is the details that make this a particularly good film. It's a period piece and it really looks the part with every detail as it should be. As I've already mentioned, the CGI is expertly done and fits seamlessly into the story. It's quite an unusual plot with much of the action focused on just one of the girls, Pauline, but then it was based on her diaries. In fact, much of the narration is made up from direct quotes from her diaries. It may not be for everyone, but I found it quite engrossing and well worth a look Recommended.My score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 30,765 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 95/100 (based on 42 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 82/100 (based on 35,964 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",Heavenly Creatures
51,jem132,Fascinating,7,4 May 2009,"This is one unusual little film that will take me a while to forget. Based on a true story, Melanie Lynksey and Kate Winslet are Pauline and Juliet, two imaginative misfits at a New Zealand high school who form an obsessive bond. Suspicions about their relationship emerge--are they lovers, or just two crazy school girls? The two girls go so far as to murder Pauline's mother to prevent separation. Peter Jackson directed this and his work is impressive, conveying Pauline and Juliet's dream world of prince and princesses and Mario Lanza without seeming pretentious. Lynskey and Winslet are both very good in challenging roles.",Heavenly Creatures

53,AngelHonesty,Not an easy movie to watch,5,17 November 2020,"The only reason I found the movie fascinating was that it is based on a true story. If it wasn't a true story it would be one hard film to swallow. The acting was very well done with Kate Winslet taking on her role as always with brilliance. The filming is poorly done as the quality is low. It's very easy to see why these girls were really messed up and it's easy to understand where they were coming from. But it's hard to follow their imaginary world that they created, leaving the harshness of reality behind to get lost in a world of their control. It's not a fun film or an easy one to watch, as you you see their struggles and the way they choose to coop through them. The close obsessive friendship was understandable as they felt all they had was each other, fully understanding the other as no else could. You could feel their pain as their parents tried to separate them and understand their predicament to not be able to be with the person you love most in this world. But in all truth as you followed their insanity of living in a fake world to replace the harsh real one it made it hard to watch the movie as you knew the ending was not going to be a good one.",Heavenly Creatures

Those involved in the production of this film know how to make a good film, using all of the right elements in suspense and pacing to make it work and to keep the film engaging. The characters are understanding and emotional, and the story building up to the end is done with care - introducing the characters and looking into their little world. The end is also done perfectly well, using a blend of pacing and excellent acting from the actresses to bring it together.

The central characters are instantly appealing thanks to a most entertaining beginning, and my hopes became high that the whole film would continue to be this great.  Unfortunately, the film was merely adequate the rest of the way.  There were some great individual moments throughout the film, but in general, the rest of the movie seemed uninspired.

56,Movi3DO,Romance Tragedy,7,23 March 2021,"Romeo and Juliet but it's between two girls and it's disturbing. Based on a true story in New Zealand, the story told the growing romance between two girls and the family circumstances that interfered with their love.The movie started off interesting as the two girls became friends quickly and played with each other a lot. Since the two girls loved writing and fantasy, the story incorporated their fantasy to create stylistic elements that conveyed the impulsive and imaginative thoughts from the girls.Despite this, for a large part of the movie I was a bit bored and not sure where the movie was going. However, the ending was surprisingly disturbing. It definitely made the movie better and actually made sense, considering what happens before the two girls' decision.Overall, not a bad movie that showed how teenage youth and impulsiveness could take turn for the worse. 6.5/10",Heavenly Creatures
57,tomimt,Interesting both visually and narratively,8,9 December 2010,"Heavenly Creatures was for a long time in my list of movies I need to see, but from a reason or an another it always managed to seem an impossible movie to see, so after a local TV-channel finally showed it, I was naturally pretty pleased. So there I was, expecting to see a sort of an exploitation flick about lesbian murderers. Boy, was I wrong with that expectation.The core element of the Heavenly Creatures is the relationship of the teen girls Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet). Juliet is a daughter of a family, that has spent most of her childhood traveling all around the world, thus giving her vigorous imagination. Pauline in the other hand is a daughter of pretty ordinary family, who feels trapped in her oh so casual life.When Juliet arrives as a new student in Paulines school they quickly find each other as soul mates, who plunge deeply inside fantastical day drams of magical kingdoms and royalties made of clay.There is a murder in the movie, the death of Paulines mother and there is a tender, lesbian romance, but they both are portrayed in very non exploiting manner. The main focus is always to the relationship of the girls and their fantasy world and how it makes their teenage angst ridden lives seem much brighter. Of course there's the tension of knowing the outcome present, but the actual plan to murder Paulines mother enters the story in relatively late, despite the outcome of it is shown right from the bat.All in all Heavenly Creatures is pretty special little movie and it has many unique characteristics. It is an interesting plunge into the minds of two girls, who are not quite as others.",Heavenly Creatures
58,sashank_kini-1,Peter Jackson Presents in Cinematic Form A 'Mental Music' of The Minds of The Two Murderesses Which Allows Us to Experience The Killers' Psyche First-Hand,8,16 January 2013,"Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film.The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been.The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part.Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter.I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.",Heavenly Creatures
59,Eumenides_0,"Fantasy, Murder and the Loss of Innocence",8,10 May 2009,"Heavenly Creatures is one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen, thanks to a good combination of aspects: Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh's screenplay, which is clear but complex; the acting by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey; and the ordinary way it was shot, emphasizing the relationship between the characters instead of the gruesome aspects of the story itself.Pauline and Juliet are two adolescent friends who make up fantasy worlds and live apart from the real one. They invent, develop and live in their inner worlds, creating their own vocabulary and shunning everything else, to the point it seems they're just one person.Their parents don't like this and so forbid each girl from seeing the other. Being two unhappy people without much outside their shared world, they decide to do everything to save it from disappearing. So they murder the mother of one of the girls.The movie plays mostly as an intimate drama about growing up and the usual confusions of adolescence. But little by little Jackson begins turning it into an unsettling experience. It becomes disturbing to see how dependent each girl is on the other and how far they'll go to protect their warped happiness.The murder scene is one of the most disturbing I've ever seen, thanks to the realistic and ordinary way it was shot, showing the girls' insecurity in the act of murder, the somber play they chose for the murder, the method of murder and the unbearable screams of their victim. It's a scene that won't leave the viewer's mind for a long time.All in all, this is a great movie, which shows what a great director Peter Jackson already was before reaching worldwide fame. It's a thriller, it's a drama, but above all it's a movie to be remembered forever.",Heavenly Creatures
60,asda-man,Heaven to hell!,9,15 December 2011,"""Heavenly Creatures"" is one of the most powerful and disturbing films I have ever seen. It's made by Peter Jackson no less and is filmed in almost all the exact locations the real friends were. What makes this film so disturbing is the somewhat funny and ""fake"" over-the-top beginning being juxtaposed with the really harsh and realistic ending leaves a really chilling impact on you. What makes it all the more disturbing is that this actually happened, and apparently one of the friends is a celebrated crime novelist living in Scotland!The visuals are eye-catching and really go deep into the twisted minds of these really, almost too close, friends. One is played by Kate Winslet (in her first every role woo!) and the other is some unknown Aussie (or should I say New Zealander) both play their parts really well. Everyone is over-the-top for the most part and it really does work. Peter Jackson invites us in to their friendship and we as an audience sort of begin to understand what the girls are like and the horrors of the ever being apart.The screenplay is extremely impressive, with the interesting narration from the girl's actual diary. But, what's most impressive is Peter Jackson's directing. When the film comes to it's climax (the whole film is a build-up which is what makes it so clever and interesting) I really did feel nervous for the mother, she just seemed like such a typical mother and Peter puts us into their shoes so you can only imagine what the girl's are thinking. I was left bemused and shocked. The murder is so realistically done it's frightening and left me cold. That's why I can't give it no less than a 10/10.Peter Jackson's ""Heavenly Creatures"" is a highly unusual, but extremely absorbing psychological drama. It keeps you fixed on their friendship until the very last scene. I think it is a film that will certainly stick with me thanks to it's striking visuals and intelligent screenplay. Peter shows us that he can't only just do fun, mindless, gorefests, but he can also do disturbing, mature, dramas (with some hilarious comedy as well.) If you see ""Heavenly Creatures"" on BBC1.

61,rdoyle29,Jackson's best film,8,6 June 2017,"Jackson tackles the Parker-Hulme murder case. In 1950's New Zealand, two teenage girls formed an intense friendship largely driven by a shared fantasy world they had created populated by a fairy tale royal family and movie stars they were obsessed with. When their parents became concerned that the relationship was too intense (and worries of lesbianism reared their ugly heads), the girls murdered one of their mothers in an effort to stay together. In what is Jackson's best film, he focuses on the intensity of their friendship and the heightened fantasy they lived in. A lot of Jackson's flaws as a filmmaker are present ... the film is too long and he encourages weird comedic overacting from some of his performers ... but it's definitely his most fully developed film, capturing the reasons that drove these girls as well as the tragedy of the story's outcome.",Heavenly Creatures

But this world is under constant siege from adults interfering with their increasingly somber whims and vagaries. The girls find themselves stalked by faceless demons and clay-clad monsters; we never really learn whether it's all just inside their heads. Orson Welles haunts their life like a ghost, risen from the dead partly by way of vintage footage inter-cut with Jackson's own material, Carl Reiner style. But ""Heavenly Creatures"" provides entirely unexpected thrills well beyond its unique cinematography and editing. Anything but mere child's play, the plot (based on a true story) is as engaging as it is unsettling. More than a decade after its original release, it also provides an opportunity to travel back in time and witness Kate Winslet's big-screen debut in one of the finer samples of Peter Jackson's work. Her spirited performance helps you forget the truckloads of crap she has appeared in since, and makes you want to revisit ""Eternal Sunshine"" or ""Romance & Cigarettes"".

You have no idea what it will be but you know that something terrible must happen; and you can't await it. Bathed in breath-taking pictures, wonderful colours and the dream-like opera music of Mario Lanza, the whole movie is one big dream and at any point it could turn into a nightmare.Peter Jackson's directing and the cinematographer should have won an Academy Award.

66,valis1949,Evil Urges,9,10 March 2009,"HEAVENLY CREATURES is Peter Jackson's award winning film which investigates The Parker-Hulme Murder Case that occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1954. The director downplays the court case to concentrate on the lurid relationship between the two young girls. Whether or not Pauline Parker or Juliet Hulme were lesbians is not resolved, however in New Zealand at the time, homosexual behavior was considered a symptom of madness and all but illegal. The film begins with stock footage depicting the idyllic nature of life in Christchurch in the mid 1950's, and then jump-cuts to a brief scene immediately following the grisly and horrific murder. By conjuring an elaborate fantasy life unrestricted by reality, the two girls are able to engage in acts which would have been ordinarily unthinkable. The intense nature of this process is strikingly similar to the modern cult obsession with the game, Dungeons & Dragons. By employing Weta Digital, a graphic effects company, Jackson demonstrates how this fantastic alternate universe could have pushed Pauline and Juliet to kill Pauline's mother at a popular hillside recreation area. This digital technique richly and sharply enhances the fantasy sequences of the girl's, ""Kingdom of Borovnia"" and ""The Fourth World"". Both young women received light jail sentences, and as a condition of their release, they were not allowed to contact each other. At the close of the film, one is left with the feeling that you have been shown graphic psychological reasons which led to the commission of a violent act, yet many questions remain unanswered. Overall, this is a very thought provoking film.",Heavenly Creatures

68,MogwaiMovieReviews,A Cult That Needs More Members,9,10 October 2019,"I got to see this unique treasure once again last week for the first time in many years and wanted to write a little something about it. It's chiefly known for being Kate Winslet's debut, and the film that put Peter Jackson on the map, preparing the way for Lord Of The Rings, but it has a lot more going for it than that.It's the true story of a New Zealand murder case back in the 1950s, but the magic the film weaves makes you forget that entirely until the last 10 minutes or so. What it is mostly about is the fantasy world two teenagers can dream up together, and is up there with Carrie (1976) as one of the best films ever made about the world of teenage girls - the internal lives of, the rejection and mockery of adulthood, the twin fear and fascination of encroaching sexuality and adult expectations.Winslet is good, although I feel she overacts just a little, but the real treasure here is Melanie Lynskey. She perfectly captures every sulky 14 year old's mannerisms and blunt insensitivities.The film masterfully draws us into their tiny empire step by tiny step, until at last we are as lost in it as they, and seeing life-size plasticine models of Mario Lanza singing in a medieval castle as just a fairly commonplace occurence.When the end comes, when the spell breaks, when reality comes crashing back and the horror of real world consequences is felt, it will break your heart. There's never been a better use of Puccini's 'Humming Chorus'.Those who know of Heavenly Creatures know that it is a classic cult film up there with Harold & Maude, with which it shares some similarities.

70,tnrcooper,powerful depiction of increasingly delusional teenage friendship,10,7 July 2008,"""Heavenly Creatures"" is the film that brought Peter Jackson his most mainstream acclaim before a suite of little films which you may have heard of, ""The Lord of the Rings"". It's the story of teenagers Juliet Hulme (capably played by Kate Winslet) and Pauline Parker (expertly played by Melissa Lynskey) who became increasingly close and created a virtual world in which they seemed increasingly involved. Their detachment from reality culminated finally in the murder of Parker's mother, a hard-working housewife (thoughtfully and sensitively played by Sarah Peirse) who was very concerned about her middle child's increasing involvement in an all-encompassing, baffling relationship with Hulme. The acting here, most especially from Lynskey and Peirse, is very good. It is difficult to ground oneself as a real person in such a fantastic case, but Peirse and Lynskey, as well as Winslet do that expertly. Lynskey's Pauline is the quieter and more pliant, to outward appearances, of the two girls. Lynskey captures Pauline's introversion with body language that conveys the fact that there is a lot going on inside her, but that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about it. Peirse plays her mother Honora, and like any mother of a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl, she casts about for ways to remain connected to her while also allowing the girl to become an individual. Peirse's Honora seems very decent, hard- working, and concerned about her daughter. However, she is also aware, at a deep level, that something is not right with her daughter and her relationship with Hulme. However, it seemed to me that because she is less-educated than Hulme that she could not articulate the nature of her concerns as well as the Hulmes could have done (but did not). Winslet is also excellent as the more outgoing and seemingly more well-adjusted of the two girls. She is the leader, the girl who would be blamed for kids' exploits, because she would be the one to lead the way. However, in spite of Juliet's outward vivacity, when she is left by her parents to receive treatment for tuberculosis while they go to England for a conference, the depth of her pain seems deep. Her parents do not recognize this and it seems to me this is one of the biggest reasons for this tragedy. In reading the comments, this does not seem to have been widely addressed as a cause of the tragedy, but to me it seems clear. Juliet, for all her outward bravado, is still a child and obviously needs a lot of attention, or at least quite a bit more than her parents give her. Her mother (well-played by Diana Kent), a psychotherapist who believes that the vast majority of problems will work themselves out, does not recognize the exception to this (questionable) rule going on right beneath her nose. This (wilful) ignorance might have cost Honora her life. Her husband Henry (played well by Clive Merrison) is an academic whose professional obligations keep him from seeing what is going so desperately wrong with his daughter. Both the Hulmes, it seemed to me, bore more responsibility for the girls' rapidly increasing separation from reality. They both had more professional expertise which could have enabled more plausibly, their intervention in this tragic situation. That said, that is not to excessively blame the Hulmes over the Parkers but simply to point out that the Hulmes might have had some of the tools necessary to address the particular challenges which the girls had created via their fantasy world. Peter Jackson's imagination, as revealed in his direction of some wryly self-aware splatterfests, could well be a significant reason why he got this job. He recognized the power of imagination, whether used for good or ill. His performance on this movie is almost certainly the main reason he was entrusted to bring the ""Lord of the Rings"" books to the screen. The girls conjure up a world with its own religious traditions, monarchy, mores, ancestry, and regional rivalries. Jackson, while the girls become increasingly detached from reality, depicts the world in terms of their alternate reality, rather than what is actually happening around them. The merging of fantasy and reality is very skillfully depicted. Jackson deserves a lot of credit for not allowing such a fantastic story to dominate the direction of the film. He expertly balances the growing friendship of the girls, the relevant elements of their lives with their families, and the efforts that both families made to address the problem, as they understood it. In the movie, as the girls get further and further removed from reality, whether they know it or not, their fantasy world is increasingly depicted by Jackson and his staff as the site of much of the action. The subtle way in which the fantasy world is increasingly the location of action, at least as seen through the girls' eyes, is perhaps Jackson's great accomplishment. He definitely deserves a lot of credit for envisioning a story in which such a graphic action is the centerpoint but yet grounding the film, still, in a tragic, recognizable reality.",Heavenly Creatures
71,rparham,"This film is ""Heavenly""",9,7 February 2006,"Years before he would turn his eye to adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's literary masterpiece, director Peter Jackson made a critical splash (if not a commercial one) with his film Heavenly Creatures. The film brought to screen a real life event in 1954 New Zealand where two girls committed matricide when the possibly of being separated from each other was inevitable. While it may not be as flashy and crowd-pleasing as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jackson's skill as a filmmaker is on display with Heavenly Creatures and proves he can work outside of the fantasy-action genre.Early in the film, we are introduced to the characters of Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet, in her first major acting role), two girls who meet at the girl's school they both attend in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953. The two quickly discover they have much in common: childhood illnesses that prevent them from participating in physical activities, a love of the arts, especially literature, and the opinion that Mario Lanza is the ""world's greatest tenor."" As their friendship blossoms, the two develop a fantasy realm entitled The 4th World, where the great creators go after they die. They also begin writing an elaborate fantasy novel, generating elaborate backstories for their characters and shortly find themselves referring to each other by names from their fantasy stories. When Juliet contracts tuberculosis and is quarantined from the general population, Pauline writes to her as both her real self and her imaginary character. As time passes, the girls begin to fantasize that their fictional world exists, populated by life-size versions of the clay sculptures they have created for their stories. The closeness of the two doesn't go unnoticed by their respective parents, with Juliet's father (Clive Merrison) beginning to suspect that the relationship between them is becoming ""unhealthy"" (read: homosexual). The parents begin to attempt to separate the two, but the girls have become almost incapable of functioning without the other. Pauline comes to the conclusion that, after Juliet is intended to move to South Africa, that she must remove the obstacle that prevents her from staying with her friend: her mother.Heavenly Creatures is very much a story of two isolated outsiders finding a kindred soul in the world and quickly building their entire existence around the other. Pauline is a frumpy, slightly homely girl who is known to scowl and put herself in the corner of a room. Juliet is much more outgoing and contemptuous of authority, correcting her teachers and performing a different lesson than the one assigned. But their commonalties outdistance their differences. Pauline has a bad leg, Juliet problematic lungs, so they spend their excercise hour sitting on the bench, talking to each other, dreaming up their fantasy world. Juliet was separated from her parents for much of her young childhood, Pauline's parents must focus on running a boarding house. Never before have they found another person so in line with what they think and feel, and are naturally drawn to each other. But their relationship is not exactly right: they disappear into their fantasies, envisioning themselves as princesses but their imaginings begin to crowd out the real world, which they find too cold and uncaring. It is easy to see why the two form their bond, but it is also easy to see that they take it too far. Unable to cope with an existence without the other, this clouds everything around them. At the same time, Heavenly Creatures is a tale of parents that are unaware or unconcerned about their children's needs. When Juliet is quarantined to the hospital, her parents go on a multi-week trip to England where her father, a respected professor, can attend a conference. Pauline's parents try to block out her growing sexuality, including an interest shown by a boy who is staying at her parent's home.The film is based, in part, on diaries kept in 1953 and 1954 by Pauline. She relates in cheerful and excited tones the approaching event that the two decided they must undertake when it is obvious that Juliet is leaving: the murder of Pauline's mother. They lead-up to the event is one of slow, building tension, as we view two innocents about to perform an act completely lacking in innocence.Jackson displays his affinity for a wild, moving camera even here, filming many sequences in a style not typical of a drama, in some cases to relate the freewheeling nature of the girl's flights of fancy and giddy good time while in the other's company. On the acting front, both Lynskey and Winslet are standouts. Lynskey portrays Pauline's depth of introversion and opening up with her friend expertly. Winselt produces just the right amount of arrogance and surety to give Juliet the appropriate superior attitude when necessary, but eventually this gives way to trepidation as she begins to realize the depth and scope of the act they are preparing to undertake.Heavenly Creatures is a tale of innocence and friendship taken too far, pushed beyond the boundaries of normalcy. Juliet and Pauline's sin wasn't homosexuality (the film suggests it to some degree, but hardly makes it certain), it was becoming blind to the world outside of their isolated bubble long after it was too late. For those who found Jackson's Lord of the Rings triptych engrossing, they would do well to check out Heavenly Creatures.",Heavenly Creatures
72,erwan_ticheler,Unusually serious Peter Jackson movie,8,4 July 2004,"SPOILERS!!!Peter Jackson was known for his splatter movies before he made ""Heavenly Creatures"".With films ""Bad Taste"" and ""Braindead"" he created a whole new niche in horror being an over the top extremely funny and bloody sub genre.I still believe that ""Braindead"" is his best effort yet (yes even better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy which is a little bit overrated if you ask me).But ""Heavenly Creatures"" is probably his second best movie ever.The story is based on true events that occurred in New Zealand in the 1950's.It is nice to see that such a story can be recreated with style on celluloid.Kate Winslet,in her first movie role,puts down a very realistic and convincing performance as Juliet and the second leading lady,Melanie Lynskey who plays Pauline, is also in great form.These two girls make the movie better than it already is,because they appear in almost every scene.Besides the leading performances there are some great supporting roles by Sarah Peirse and Simon O'Connor as Pauline's parents. Although it is a very serious movie with ""real"" persons Peter Jackson still creates his usual over the top characters like the rev. Norris,a copy of Orson Welles (""the most hideous person alive"") and of course his own cameo (Jackson plays a bum outside a theater).The violence at the end is long awaited and not surprising since it is announced pretty soon.Still,the actual killing of Pauline's mother is the best scene of the movie in which Jackson creates a tension that is truly riveting.Even when it is not really surprising.All that is obviously accomplished by the splendid acting of the three actresses involved in the scene.It is a shame that Peter Jackson never made more of these movies,because he surely has got the talent.But I have to say that his strength lies in creating fantastic stories with fantastic bloody effects. 8/10",Heavenly Creatures
73,jdollak,What's the fuss about? See it for yourself.,9,17 April 2003,"In reading over the comments on this movie, I'm amazed at how varied the interpretations are of this film. I might have some spoilers here.The lesbian aspect of this film is a characteristic which I don't see a controversy over.  There's no indication that homo-phobia is what led these girls to kill.  It's their intense friendship, which is played out in a way that suggests more of a symbiotic relationship than a romance between them. They both get sucked into this fantasy which is far more appealing to them than dealing with their problems.  Pauline has a family that she finds demeaning, and she clearly doesn't get along with anyone at school. Juliet is very unhappy with her family life, and we can see this also in how she tries to make herself a center of attention at school, and with guests, and to a lesser extent, to her family. I wouldn't doubt that there was a certain amount of romantic entanglement between these girls in real life.  This sort of a friendship would lead to it, and they probably wouldn't say that they were in love with one another, it would be something more to the effect that ""she understands me, and no one else does.""Jackson knows how to make a movie that feels like it goes slowly, but it's far more effective if you try to remember how it was like to build a fort in the woods with your friends as a child.I do feel that the issues discussed in each of these reviews only testifi es for the many levels one can view these events as taking place on.",Heavenly Creatures

Many of the fantasies are things that anyone with a memory of being young will recognize, at least generically.  But when the fantasy world starts taking control of the girls lives and then turns murderous, the fun turns to horror and the slightly crazy coming-of-age story ends in violent insanity.  What makes the movie so good is that it is meticulously made.  It is absolutely believable.  Look at the girls' dream-world one way and it's ingenious fun; look at it another way, and it's madness.

76,vip-danii,Excellent!,10,17 May 2014,"This is film-making at its best! Even those, who don't like the storyline itself, have to admit that the execution is excellent.It's very atmospheric. The acting is impeccable. This was Kate Winslet's very first movie, after which she went on to become one of the most prominent Hollywood stars -- and rightfully so. She's massively talented.Winslet's co-star (Melanie Lynski) was also very, very good, but, for some reason, her acting career never took off.They couldn't have picked a better cast -- just perfect. All the actors were very convincing in their respective roles.A very accurate portrayal of mental illness and sexuality in a society where such issues were totally taboo.Anyone can enjoy this movie, but it will be of particular interest to those, who like exploring mental health/psychology. Both girls have personality disorders (Juliette - histrionic; Pauline - avoidant), but psychiatry was not as well-developed as it is today, so their behavior is blamed on ""unusually intense imagination"" and ""homosexuality"".",Heavenly Creatures
77,ThreeGuysOneMovie,an amazing fantasy world,7,3 June 2012,"Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) lives in Christchurch, New Zealand. It is a tiny suburban town. Pauline doesn't have many friends and mostly keeps to herself.Juliet (Kate Winslet) moves to town from England and befriends Pauline. The two girls quickly become inseparable and spend most of their time together. They create an elaborate fantasy world together and the two girls live inside it.The Girl's parents become worried that the relationship is becoming a bit unhealthy (and could be more than friendship.) and they decide to separate the girls.The parents don't understand the depth of the girls friendship however, and when one of the parents decides to move to South Africa the girls decide that they will stop at nothing to be together.This movie is based on actual events that occurred in New Zealand in 1954. Peter Jackson was stickler for details when he made this movie and used actual passages from Pauline's diary and filmed in many of the locations where the events actually happened. The result is a truly gripping and engaging movie with a tragic conclusion.Jackson made this movie a few years after the cult classic Dead Alive which is hands down one of the goriest movies ever made. You can see a lot of similar camera angles and extreme close ups in this movie as well. It is an interesting study in the development of Jackson as a director.Heavenly Creatures is not perfect, there is quite a bit of over acting to be found here and you can see how far Winslet has come as an actor. That said, it is an engaging movie with some really interesting visuals, especially the clay people from the fantasy world when they come to life.Like what you see here?

I love the whole idea of the film, but what's most interesting is how you are able to see through the eyes of two very special girls.  I love the theme of this film as well. It's hard to be a teenage girl and be misunderstood by everyone, but it's great too, because you leave a strange path and mystery that everyone wants to solve, but can't.  I can relate to this movie with it's theme of friendship and the nature of Pauline and Juliet.  And when I watch this film, it makes me think of the grown-ups, ""Who are they to attempt to break a solid friendship?""What's great is the bond that Pauline and Juliet form and share between one another.  That, to me, is the most important part of the whole film! :o)I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has shared and formed a special bond or friendship with someone, or basically anyone who just loves movies!

Kate Winslet and Melanie Lenskey are great in their performances, as well as the adults. In fact, the two girls are so impressive, it's a wonder how they didn't get any Oscar consideration.Even for a low-budget, this film has a lot of style. From the fantasy visions the girls have of their writings, to the love they share for each other and the tragic ending, this is just one gorgeous film. The early stages of the Weta special effects company can be seen here, and (once again) for such a low-budget, what they did is very impressive.There's nudity in this film -- at least from the cut I saw -- mainly from the chest of Winslet and Lenskey.The music is intriguing, making me wish there was a copy of it somewhere out there in the world for me to listen to.Overall, this film is rated-R appropriately (as much as I despise the MPAA) this film has blood and nudity. Yet, Jackson does not parade those two elements, making him a man of taste. The story is brutal and heartbreaking, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with a sharp mind.",Heavenly Creatures

But the best part of the movie for me was the performances by the two leads, especially Kate Winslet who is fabulous in her first film.  Heavenly Creatures grows on you.

This the true story of two girls in 1950's New Zealand who become inseparable friends who become transfixed with one another leading to a series of shocking events that they feel they are pre-destined to commit. The two teenagers are played fantastically by the then unknown Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynsky. With the now expected excellent direction from the future superstar Peter Jackson. Here you can actually feel Jackson playing and experimenting with some of the styles he later used to such great effect in the LOTR trilogy. The supporting cast are very good and we are drawn into a real mixture of emotions that is the wrong directors hands could have been an absolute disaster. But we go through the full range of emotions from shock to sympathy to repulsion leady up to the truly shocking ending. Stunning stuff that I will certainly view many times.,Heavenly Creatures

Peter Jackson and Kate Winslet have afterwards proved many other times that this movie wasn't a coincidence and that they are both very talented.This movie is really worth seeing. If you should read a story like this somewhere, you just wouldn't believe it, but this movie really makes you understand how such things can happen in real life.

85,twilliams76,"""Treat yourself, Mum!"" ... and ""treat yourself, viewer!""",10,13 July 2011,"Heavenly Creatures is Peter Jackson's (of The Lord of the Rings fame) BEST film! Before Mr. Jackson was a multi (3 of em!) Academy Award winning filmmaker he was already an Oscar nominee for this movie.Heavenly Creatures is a very small independent New Zealand film that few outside of the movie meccas of Los Angeles and New York City saw, knew about, or had access to upon its original release in 1994.Heavenly Creatures contains very-grim, difficult subject matter that is perhaps all-the-more troublesome because it was based on a startling 1954, real-life event. It is a compelling, mesmerizing, bone-chilling, stunning and astonishing piece of film that I must say is one of the best I have ever seen (and I have seen A LOT of movies). The film is about two highly imaginative and intelligent teenage girls, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme played by two actresses making their glorious feature film debuts: the great Melanie Lynskey (Up In the Air, Sweet Home Alabama, Ever After) and a sensational Kate Winslet (Titanic, Sense & Sensibility, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) in two captivating, stars-are-born performances whose intense, potent friendship draws deep concern from both sets of parents (and for good reason ... ask Mrs. Parker!).The girls saw themselves as ""heavenly creatures"" who, alone, were able to enter into a magical realm -- the Fourth World -- populated by beings (Kings, Queens, Princes, roguish knaves and giant butterflies) of their own creation. New Zealand was shocked and stunned by what came from this friendship that was going to be terminated as Juliet was going to be forced to leave Christchurch, New Zealand (with her father) and live with relatives in South Africa (as he returned to their native England). Actual diary entries of Pauline's help construct and recreate the horrific sequence of events that lead to the gruesome climax of the film that takes place in a peaceful and serene Christchurch city park.The scene is both visually and audibly unforgettable as it is a beautifully sequenced/choreographed descent (in more ways than one) into a park valley by three individuals that is scored by Puccini's slow and innocent, beautifully enchanting ""The Humming Chorus"" that hypnotizes the viewer until it is marred by a crunch/thud, some blood-curdling groans and several more crushing shrieks! And, again ... this is ALL based upon true, actual events! I have never seen a film like this before (it is beautiful, imaginative, grisly, unsettling and dark) -- and it is awe-inspiring (at the artistic-level) knowing of the talent found in front of and behind the camera. Heavenly Creatures is a divine 42 out of 10.It is most definitely NOT a movie for all audiences; but for those who enjoy film (REAL film lovers) it must not be missed.",Heavenly Creatures
86,wadechurton,"Under-engaging, over-rated botch-up.",3,30 June 2010,"More than any of Peter Jackson's movies, 'Heavenly Creatures' is reliant on an audience's connection with the characters. The movie was based on 'Daughters Of Heaven', an acclaimed 1991 stage play which in turn was a representation of the infamous Parker-Hulme murder, committed in Christchurch, 1954. Enacted with just bare sets, startling lighting effects and a talented cast, the play was an eerie, unsettling experience, heartbreaking and horrifying as the two girls' friendship and private musings spiraled into paranoia and murder. Rather than offering us a pared-down, chilling depiction of a shared and gathering madness, Jackson instead elects to smother the screen in a hideously garish CGI 'fantasy world', destroying completely the play's genuinely creepy 'just two people on a stage' effect. What's more, it was this movie which first showed that while he could do broad splatter-comedy, Jackson had real problems with engaging our emotions in a serious, dramatic production. None of the characters ring true; the adults are oddly cartoonish and the girls are merely talkative and almost distant. Peter Jackson just can't make us care about the characters, and that's possibly because he doesn't. 'Heavenly Creatures' is flat, dull and pedestrian; a botched adaption of good material and a tragic waste.",Heavenly Creatures
87,shivamt25,Heavenly Creatures,8,19 May 2017,"Heavenly Creatures is a story about the notorious duo Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who, in their teenage years, killed Honora Parker, Pauline's mother, in cold blood. Parker's murder is one famous case of 1950s which later inspires many plays, books and also, movies. Pauline and Juliet like nothing more than each other's company. They came close as they both had experience of suffering from some kind of severe illness as children. During their friendship, the girls used to create imaginative worlds with kings and queens and knights and loved to dream about that instead of focusing on reality. In reality, their parents were getting suspicious of their friendship and hence, decided that the girls should be separated as their friendship is poisonous. All this and a lot happened after which the girls decided that killing Pauline's mother and running away is the only option left for them. Sure, you would say that their attachment was unhealthy. It is convenient to say that it wasn't love that brought them together but pure madness. Both of the girls lived in a fantasy world created by them in their head to escape the reality that they may not stay together forever.But this movie is not about that. Peter Jackson directed Heavenly Creatures is a portrayal of how innocent between two teenagers can wreak havoc. They movie shows us how close they were, almost inseparable. They lived as if there is no one else in the world. But, when you feel this much connected with someone, it is almost impossible to imagine how one will live if they get away somehow. You start feeling that everyone is your enemy as they are trying to take that one thing away which you cannot part with. Even if those who are trying to do this are your own parents. Step by step, the whole scenario is explained beautifully, right up to the murder. The movie gave a successful entry to Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet into the world of Hollywood. Both of them played the troubled teenagers quite efficiently. Winslet brought the craziness to her character and Lynskey brought the innocence. The screenplay is something to look forward to. The audience is taken on a ride which swings between the reality and the fantasy world. In the end, the movie will make you feel sorry for both the girls, even after knowing what they did. I think this movie is remarkable and gives everyone something to think about.",Heavenly Creatures

But from other comments in this section, it seems that other people out there share this view. So there's little I can add, I just wanted to say that this magical, tragical tale marvels me more every time I see it, and that I believe that it is for Works of Art of this magnitude that cinema was invented for. It takes you along with the girls in their descent to madness with such compelling passion and energy that you are willing to believe that they are not mad at all, but have really reached that utopian higher state of consciousness and pure unrestrained devotion for another person, regardless of sex, that eludes the rest of us mortals.

89,DAHLRUSSELL,Peter Jackson is just wonderful!,10,20 July 2006,"I saw this film years ago when it had its major theatrical release. Years later now, it remains as powerful. The wonderful, odd vision of Peter Jackson (Director of LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is put to use in this story of two young girls whose fantasy world runs amok.I think it would be fair to say this is the breakout film that brought Kate Winslet to the well-deserved attention of a world market, but her co-star Melanie Lynskey gives the more complex performance of the two in this, if only because her role is given more layers. The DVD is an uncut version, and it lends a different light to her sexuality than the version in theatres, but it is all still awkwardly (perfect for this story telling) ambivalent.Jackson makes weird and wonderful use of the clay figures and fantasy land of the girls, and although I don't really think he has a full handle on what a girl's fantasy land would be made of (this one was awfully muddy  ick), it is still a compelling, complete and disturbing vision  all fitting. There are truly great moments which feels completely, messily, real. Sarah Peirse's entire performance is wonderful, as the more downtrodden and distressed mother. This is really fine acting.Not long after the film was released, the actual case this was based on was re-opened, and it was found that, as part of their ""treatment,"" the girls were given a drug to sedate them, but it has since been proved to cause extreme violent outbursts. It is too bad this information could not have been available as the film was made. I believe Jackson could have incorporated this and made the film even richer. But that would be icing.

91,changingshades,"For a movie with Lesbians and violent death, kind of a let down.",6,31 December 2006,"Now that I've seen this movie, I only have to see Bad Taste to have seen the entire directorial catalog of Peter L. Jackson. While not as horrible as some of his other feeble attempts at low budget cinema, this movie did promise a lot more than it delivered. Just because a movie is set in the 50's doesn't it mean it has to move like someone who is old enough to recall the events of the movie. Yes, I'm well aware that Jackson did a very good job of recreating actual events. If I wanted that, I'd have rented a documentary or at least watched the History Channel. Teenage Lesbians that are boring is generally a bad sign. Teenage Lesbians that have Kate Winslett amongst them and are still boring is a crime against nature. The main reason I tracked this movie down was because I'm becoming more and more of a Kate Winslett fan the more of her work I see. She is a fine actress and really spreads out her range. Now I know she was 19 when she made this and I know a lot of the problems I have were with the writing, but Kate can, at least today, bring out a nuanced performance out of any tripe she's given. Apparently this is a skill she developed in adulthood. The other actress, Melanie Lynsky was actually quite good as the plain common girl who finds love in the rich girl. Her change in attitude given the situation was quite astounding and well done. I actually came the closest to caring about her than anyone else in the film. It's not a bad movie, per se, but it really doesn't have anything to really set it apart from other movies. This movie is only worth a rent to see the early careers of people trying to find their footing early on in their career. 6/10",Heavenly Creatures

93,mrrockey,Fascinating!,10,1 August 2013,"Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them.What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best.I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character.I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy.But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own.Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work.Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.",Heavenly Creatures
94,shattenjager777,A surprisingly thoughtful Jackson and predictably brilliant Winslet make a memorable experience,10,3 May 2004,"Though I adore the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, it's due to the incredible work of Tolkien on the source material rather than Peter Jackson's direction, which I in fact dislike. And what little other work of his I have seen has been nowhere near that level of quality in terms of direction or any other aspects, so finding this thoughtful, chillingly brilliant piece of direction and writing from him was a surprise.*SPOILERS COMING*The tale is of two teenaged girls who escape their realities by indulging in an intense fantasy world and over time the line between that fantasy and reality becomes blurred to the point that there is no separation--and Jackson wisely gives us no hint of when we are entering or leaving the realm of fantasy, even though there had to be a temptation to do so. He and Frances Walsh also managed to deliver truly wonderfully-written, thoughtful dialogue, though some of its best moments are the excerpts from Paulina's diary, showing her conversion to the speech patterns of Juliet and then her rediscovery of her own voice as she takes on the dominant role in the relationship beginning with their sex scene and continuing through the remainder of the film. This part was where Kate Winslet really shone--performing brilliantly the nervousness, sadness, and confusion that her character feels at being suddenly in the submissive role she has been forced into through her entire life and hated. Now I'll get back to general film comments.*SPOILERS OVER*The direction and writing in general were very intelligent and thoughtful, though to explain how is really difficult without spoilers, so those comments are really above.The performances were generally good enough for roles that didn't require much except for the two leads. In those two leads, Kate Winslet was wonderful and Melanie Lynskey was good enough but had most of the work done for her. While neither had a much better character than the other, I think Winslet was given the opportunity to express a greater variety of emotions and feelings while Lynskey was usually given her emotions by Jackson's camera angle's, which were brilliantly and perfectly worked out. It's also noticeable that both girls (especially Winslet--though Hulme did actually look rather more sickly) do look like their true historical counterparts.Overall, this was an intense and very thoughtful film experience given to us by Peter Jackson's exercise of a cinematic brain that I never knew he had, a powerful, interesting, frightening story, and a notably excellent performance by Kate Winslet (as usual). Only two years later, she would take on one of the greatest female characters in literary history in Ophelia from William Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" and nail it perfectly, and here she nails perfectly a role almost as difficult in a masterful film. But Jackson is the real star here. He may be an Oscar-winning director now, but I really think if he deserved one for direction (not picture, for which he deserved three in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films--I want to be clear on that), this was where he did.",Heavenly Creatures
95,Euphorbia,Peter Jackson with training wheels,5,2 October 2004,"The most startling thing about this movie is how much of the senior production staff of Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson had already brought together for this earlier film. Jackson's superb skills as a cinematic visualizer are also already evident in this polished production. The man 'thinks movie.' But alas Jackson is still thinking out loud here. The ventriloquist's lips are moving, and the dummies are too obviously made of wood (I mean the characters, not the animated clay figurines). In this film, Jackson's abilities at directing actors were, let us say, still latent.In ""Heavenly Creatures,"" Jackson set out to make a 'true crime' version of George Roy Hill's ""The World of Henry Orient."" That film missed perfection because of the affected cornball performance of Peter Sellers in the title role. If this was the performance Hill wanted, shame on him. But if this wasn't bad direction but rather mis-casting, then double-shame on the director for failing to replace Sellers when he found he could not control him. When Peter Jackson found he could not control his original 'Aragorn' in making ""Lord of the Rings,"" he fired him and hired Viggo Mortenson.By contrast to the one bad casting choice in ""Henry Orient,"" in ""Heavenly Creatures"" nearly everyone seems mis-cast, with the single exception of Sarah Peirse. The rest of the performers never let you forget that they are playacting -- which is fine on the stage, but not on the silver screen. If this was intentional on Jackson's part, well 'nice try,' but it doesn't work. I suspect it was not intentional, because this same weak direction is evident in the first scenes Jackson filmed for LOTR -- the four hobbits pursued by the black riders. Luckily for Jackson, and for all of us viewers, he found the confidence to begin directing realistic performances around that time (I suspect that his veteran producers on LOTR might have taught him a thing or two about this). Besides ""Henry Orient,"" ""Heavenly Creatures"" invites comparison to two other films I have seen recently -- ""A Real Young Girl"" by Catherine Breillat, and ""Lost and Delirious"" by Lea Pool. Breillat has certainly mastered the art of getting realistic performances from her actors. But she goes much too far in that direction, forgetting that the seemingly unedited intimate reality of relentlessly ordinary people is boring to watch for an hour and a half (then again, if you like ""Reality TV,"" which I loathe, then you might also like Breillat's films).Pool's film is a lot like ""Heavenly Creatures,"" and just misses success for pretty much the same reasons: it is not possible to believe in or sympathize with the characters -- the problems not being so much in the script or the production, but in the nuances of direction, the failure to ""make it real,"" to transcend stereotypes and create authentic individual characters.(For girls school movies done right, check out ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" and ""Mona Lisa Smile."")5/10",Heavenly Creatures
96,heywood100,Surprisingly Decent,7,23 January 2003,"This was something of a surprise for me - I was expecting a boring period piece from the director of the vastly over-rated Lord Of The Rings, and instead I got a well scripted, well acted, very moving drama (from the director of the vastly over-rated Lord Of The Rings). Admittedly, it pays a lot of attention to the architecture, clothing, and language of 1950's New Zealand, but unlike some lavish period dramas it doesn't do this at the expense of other areas of the film.English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) has just arrived in New Zealand, where she bonds with Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) due to their shared overactive imaginations. They create a fantasy world together that excludes all others and become inseparably close. When events seem to be conspiring to separate them, the thin line they've been walking between fantasy and reality seems to collapse, as signified by a ballroom dance scene featuring life-size representations of clay figurines.To be fair, Peter Jackson does very well here. The film descends from the bright colours and sunny days of the opening scenes to freezing blues and plain weird Orson Welles dream sequences as the girls themselves become more and more desperate. The script is good, and based on a true story (which makes it that little bit more disturbing), though it sometimes veers close to becoming standard teen angst fare, and there's way too much screaming near the end. Another slight problem is that Kate Winslet is quite obviously not 15 years old, but the fantasy sequences suspend belief anyway, so it doesn't really matter too much.At first it may seem that the girls are indeed too isolated and wrapped up in their own world, but the film asks us: Why shouldn't they be? They were perfectly happy until people tried to separate them, and the measures they go to in order to avoid this fate would never have happened if people had just left them alone. However, the film does fall down on one account - it may have benefited from the girls being less obviously lesbian. On the plus side it means that we have Kate Winslet in her underwear, but people involved in the incident in real life have said that this was not the case and it seems to simplify their relationship a bit too much. It takes the complex emotions and reduces them a little by introducing basic lust as well.Heavenly Creatures explores friendship, teenage rebellion, and the lengths people will go because of them, and it's definitely worth a look.",Heavenly Creatures
97,Duzniak38,Heavenly,10,29 July 2005,"Heavenly Creatures is a stunning film, surprisingly coming from the gore-maestro Peter Jackson. It follows two girls, Juliet Hulme and Pauline Rieper, who start talking to each other in a P.E. lesson. Over the days their friendship progresses, until they become good friends, and spend time with each other discussing actors, listening to records, and playing dress-up. The acting from Winslet and Lynesky is absolutely terrific from the beginning, Lynesky playing a moody young girl, and Winslet playing the happy, inventive young lady, who is a dab hand a clay modelling and painting. As the film continues, Juliet and Pauline's friendship becomes more and more stronger, as they begin to spend practically every minute of every day with each other. Sarah Peirse give a fine performance as Hilda Hulme, Pauline's mother, who by this time in the movie has become more than a little concerned about the bonding of the two girls. The ending is unforgettable. It is brutal and shocking, however the minutes leading up to the end are beautiful, complete with a spine-tingling, haunting choir music soundtrack. This movie is a beautiful, moving experience, which should leave you tearful by the end.",Heavenly Creatures
98,two-rivers,A Crushed Dream of Exclusive Togetherness,10,13 July 2000,"Pauline and Juliet are two friends, who accidentally meet in Christchurch in the fifties and are then unable to part again. It is a fateful encounter, which tragically ends in a conspiracy to murder. Pauline's mother is intentionally killed by the two girls with a brick hid in a carrier bag, during an outing.Why did it have to happen? The movie answers this question in a long flashback which lasts until the starting point (the murder scene) is reached again.The two girls' friendship is unusual and exclusive. Pauline and Juliet only playfully include other persons in their world, famous contemporaries like Mario Lanza and Orson Welles, one as hero, the other as demon. Parents, teachers and other persons of their immediate vicinity are of lesser importance and become significant merely as objects of their mockery, like the clumsy tenant who lives in the house of Pauline's family and has the bad luck to fall in love with the girl. They are all denied access to their privacy. Therefore they do not even have the remotest idea of the existence of Borovnia, the dreamworld that the girls have created to escape from the troubles of daily routine. Diello, heir to the throne of Borovnia, becomes an ally in the fight against the lack of understanding of the others. When Pauline is interrogated on account of her alleged lesbian tendency, powers of imagination become so strong that the psychologist is killed by the sword stroke of the fiercely intervening Diello. And in the same way Diello comes to Juliet's rescue when, while being treated for tuberculosis in hospital, she is being plagued by a clergyman. He simply strangles him from behind so that his devotional words become inaudible.But when both girls' parents finally agree on separating the friends and sending Juliet to South Africa this fanciful method of confronting and eliminating the mischievous attacks of their fellow creatures does not work any longer and the continued existence of their salvaging fantasy world is seriously threatened. The conspiracy to murder is nothing but a desperate rescue operation in a state of emergency. Exclusive friendship has become something like a life supporting obsession of which the loss would leave the girls without any support in a strange and sinister world.",Heavenly Creatures
99,royale_w_cheez44,"Challenging, Heady",8,13 May 2012,"""Heavenly Creatures"" may very well wind up being, first and foremost, ""that one film Peter Jackson did in the 90s with Kate Winslet"". Hell, it probably already is. At least, it's the attitude I went into the film with. That simplistic title betrays the fact that ""Heavenly Creatures"" is an extremely accomplished work, and a challenging one at that. Though I was not familiar with the true story behind the screenplay, it goes without saying that sympathizing with a couple of emotional, dramatic, downright selfish girls who go to extremes by the end of the story cannot be expected from a normal audience. That said, Jackson doesn't canonize them as tragic heroes as much as he fleshes them out as lost souls, whose pursuit of love and companionship is clouded with delusions of endless despair.The film is visually intoxicating and in-depth almost to a fault, really delving into the idyllic fantasy realm that Pauline and Juliet create. It's a nebulous world that falls just somewhat short of allowing the audience into its threshold, perhaps due in part to the incredible performances of Winslet and Lynskey, both of which regard their fantasy as their own little secret.Even if the off-putting and confusing nature of the emotional, eccentric leads makes the film a difficult experience to be fully immersed in, the ending packs a powerful punch. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, what could be ""movie of the week"" material becomes a traumatic, devastating end and a tragic understanding of how the search for something so pure and innocent can go so wrong.",Heavenly Creatures
100,Teach-7,Ah - adolescence!,10,17 January 1999,"A unique movie about teenage murderesses that perfectly captures the rapture of being young and feeling alive. I believe ""Heavenly creatures"" succeeds because it fixes on the adolescent mind and sticks to it through the entire movie.This is the world seen through the eyes of youth. This is what it feels like. This is the fanaticism, the helplessness, the horror, the rush of hormones, the starry-eyed wonder that comes from discovering that you are the hub around which the universe spins. The adult world has no place in this movie. So the two girls tries to dissociate themselves from it. When their parents threatens to destroy their world, they calmly contemplate murder. It's as simple as that. And it's beautifully done by a master director. One of the classics of the 90'ies.",Heavenly Creatures
101,SanTropez_Couch,They'll Never Walk Alone,8,9 March 2003,"Why do so many love stories in film end in bloodshed? Well, for one thing it gives dramatic impact, and if the death takes place at the end it leaves us with a shock, even if we already knew it was coming. Sometimes in films, a person's death at the finish seems so tacked on and contrived that it feels like a last ditch effort by the filmmakers to give their film some importance. This is one of those times where it seems like the only fitting end without feeling like everything was worked-out in advance. Sure, the film is based on a true story, but even still, any part of the film could have been altered for a more exciting story -- I would never look to a film for a recounting of real-life events (it's too important for that). This isn't a film that exists solely for the purpose of letting the world know that specific events occurred, it works on a basic level of the obsession two people can have for each other.The story takes place in the early-to-mid 1950s in New Zealand. Juliet (Kate Winslet) is new in town and to the Christchurch Girls High School. She's an intelligent, imaginative daughter of a well-to-do family and she's a little snotty. When she corrects the teacher in French class, Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) just knows that this chick is going to be her new best friend.
They quickly become close, trading off each others' flesh wounds. Pauline has a long scar on her leg that forced her to stay in bed as a youth while doctors drained fluid out for two years, and Juliet has scars on her lungs from a respiratory illness she had as a child. Her parents went so far as to send her to the Bahamas so she could be in a warmer climate -- and left her there for fives years (twice later in the film, when her parents tell her of travel plans they have, and when they send her to stay in a hospital due to tuberculosis without canceling their travel plans, she's understandably upset). Pauline enjoys spending time with Juliet and her parents (she's embarrassed by her folks -- they rent rooms in the house to boarders).The two girls spend more and more time together and become inseparable. They share a love for Mario Lanza and old movie stars like James Mason. They both write and Pauline records her thoughts in her diary. The two create a fantasy land, the Fourth World, that they'll go to when they die. Two days a year they can use a key -- an extra part of their brain that only about ten people have -- to visit the Fourth World through a passage in the clouds. (The morphing effects transplanting the girls to their Eden -- not to mention the life-size clay sculptures that thwack bible thumpers -- are seamless, especially for 1994, just a year after ""Jurassic Park."")Eventually, the parents of Juliet fear that the two may be forming an unhealthy relationship and try to separate them. To make a bad thing worse, Juliet's parents (who have their own marital troubles, as well) decide to send her away to South Africa for the good of her health. So the two girls, even more infatuated with each other, vow to do whatever they can to stay together. The finale, even though we know and are indeed told it's coming, is no less brutal or gruesome. It had me cringing, to be sure.What's interesting about the film -- what elevates it beyond the level of an interesting crime-drama -- is Jackson's direction, which isn't to overlook the accomplished acting in the film, particularly from Winslet, one of the most compellingly different actresses we have. Those trips to the girls' Eden, the place that makes them so elated that they're willing to do anything to secure it, give the film something extra. The feel of the film, almost like a ""Degrassi High"" episode half the time, is awfully unique. The soft-focus photography that looks like ""JFK"" gives the film the impression of being as dreamy as the journeys to the Fourth World.***1/2",Heavenly Creatures

103,alafolle,An underrated classic.,9,23 June 2000,"""Heavenly Creatures"" is a dark, beautiful, and ultimately chilling film which has not gotten the recognition it deserves.Peter Jackson accomplishes the nearly impossible task of telling a real-life murder story without demonizing either the killers or the victim, or trivializing the tragedy.   He wisely steers clear of the sensationalism, homophobia, and salacious reporting which marked the trial of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, and tells the story from the girls' point of view--through their writings and diary entries.  We get a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two girls who created a fantasy world which eventually proved to be more compelling than their own unhappy lives, and who were starved enough for affection to commit a heinous crime in order to avoid being separated.Jackson is a master of the subtle touches that add color and life to a film. Every gesture and expression tells a story.  The lighting creates the perfect mood for each scene.  Hints of a breakdown in the wall between fantasy and reality are sprinkled toward the end of the film.  Not a single camera shot is wasted as the story rushes inexorably to its conclusion.  A few of the fantasy sequences with clay figurines are a bit over the top, but otherwise the direction was nearly perfect.In lesser hands, this story could have easily devolved into gay-baiting tabloid trash.  ""Teenage Lesbians Bludgeon Mum!""  But here it is made clear that the relationship between Pauline and Juliet, though it involved some sexual experimentation, was that of close friends--not lovers.  The violence is also kept to minimum.  There are a few scenes of fantasy murder which provide a contrast to the real violence at the end.  The ultimate murder scene is neither sanitized nor overly dramatized--it is truly chilling.""Heavenly Creatures"" leans heavily on the talents of its actresses, and they perform superbly.  Sarah Peirse lends a quiet dignity to Pauline's ill-fated mother.  Kate Winslet, in her first film role, is excellent as the spoiled but emotionally-neglected Juliet.  The real show-stealer is Melanie Lynskey, who was dragged out of a High School drama class in New Zealand four weeks before shooting began, and gives a captivating performance as the deeply disturbed Pauline.It is a shame that this excellent film is not listed among the Top 250.  I highly recommend it.",Heavenly Creatures
104,klesker,Different.,9,5 July 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!When i say different i mean different to what Peter Jackson had done before this. He may now be the hottest directorial talent around now (with a little trilogy by the name of Lord of the Rings giving him a push in the right direction) but before all that he was notorious around the cult circle for his excessively gruesome yet incredibly funny horror/splatter movies.As entertaining as these movies may be, they are not cinematic gold like Lord of the Rings or this gem that he churned out in the early 90's. In fact it was this type of movie that proved to the world that Jackson can be a mature and adult film maker if given the right material (another example would be Steven Spielberg and Schindler's List).This film takes place between the years of 1952 and 1954 and focuses on two young schoolgirls that develop a bizarre friendship in which they create a fantasy world that only they know about. When their relationship appears to become something more than just mutural friends their parents try to put and end to it by separating the two, ending with tragic results.As with every Peter Jackson movie the film starts off with his usual bravado and energy with the performances played out with his slightly OTT take on the world. There is not a bad performance in this movie, and it also displays Jackson's ability for spotting new talent (this was Kate Winslet's first big role).However when the relationship starts to take a turn for the worse, Jackson shows his talent as a great film maker. The performances become more subtle and eerily precise as the truly shocking reality of what will happen starts to unfold. The leading ladies become more disturbing than any screen psycho to date, with the added oomph that they are just children.The ending is the icing on the cake for me and i know that'll sound sick and sadistic to anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing this film, but it just proves what a disturbing picture this is. It shows how far, too far can go and how strong the relationship was if, in the end, it would lead to murder to keep them together.This is a movie that is endlessly watchable. Definitely a more mature and adult film than the rest of his cannon (apart from LOTR of course) and it also showed the start of what would become a truly great talent that would dominate Hollywood ten years later. There are not many films today that can be funny, compelling, heartbreaking, chilling, disturbing and beautiful all at the same time, but this one pulls it off with effortless ease.5/5",Heavenly Creatures
105,Adrian-32,Disturbing,9,30 March 1999,"Peter Jackson`s 1994 film ""Heavenly Creatures"" has got to be one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen.  Not that I`m saying it`s bad or anything, it was a good film. ""Heavenly Creatures"" is a very unconventional movie, mainly because its story is so bizarre. I have never witnessed such a deep look inside the twisted,psychotic minds of two teenage girls during the 1950`s.  And the fact that this film is based on real life facts just makes it even more chilling.  The film`s story is very dark, but the film itself is quite colourful. Jackson takes the viewer into the delusional fantasy world imagined by the two protagonists, filled with magnificent and sometimes eerie images.  Kate Winslet is terrific, she probaly delivers her best performance in this film as a deeply disturbed adolescent whose unhealthy friendship with another girl (Melanie Lynskey) ultimately leads to a grisly murder. ""Heavenly Creatures"" is quite graphic as it focuses on the two girl`s unhappy lives and the lesbian love they finally share. Their imaginations were so distorted, it was actually quite frightening to think that teenagers could be so delusional and merciless. The film`s scenery is quite nice, but even the most pleasant backdrop couldn`t weaken the extremely disturbing plot.

In teenager world the general crap feeling teters between melancholy and violence. The future is not bright and why should it be for anyone else, feelings to regret and eradicate.The dream sequences are fluid between the real and the imagined, plenty violent and thus traumatic/memorable.

This was undoubtedly the peak of that period, by far.I'm not a big fan of the LOTR movies, but am hoping Jackson will someday soon return to territory such as this sometime soon. It's like this -- watching ""Heavenly Creatures"" or ""Dead Alive"" truly create a cinematic feel unlike no other -- completely original works they are, devoid of any cliches or commercialism. The LOTR movies might have some style, of course, but they are more exercises in money making products pumped out of the studio than pure artistic statements.Here's to Peter Jackson.

This movie showcased what would come in the future for the stars and director of this film. Winslet put on a great performance, the most believable part of the whole movie, not taking much away from her counterpart who did a good job in her own right.

Although based on real diary entries, and hence episodic in nature, the director (Peter Jackson) manages to make each scene flow effortlessly into the next and hold the attention of the viewer with a great, economical script, superb acting, lovely shot composition (see it in 2.35:1 ""letterbox"" aspect ratio), and, most of all, the fascination of the bizarre fantasy world that the girls inhabit. Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) are highly unusual characters (to say the least!), but their performances never lapse into caracature or the grotesque - they remain highly believable and sympathetic, making the grisly ending all the more shocking. My favourite sequence is the one accompanied by the singing of Mario Lanza which shows the beginning of the girls' friendship - superbly edited and visually captivating. What stays with you though, is the gradual erosion of a happy, healthy friendship, and the accompanying slide into tragedy.",Heavenly Creatures

The relationship between Pauline and Juliet is the pivot of the film, a pivot well crafted. Melanie Lynsky paints the brooding, intense portrait of Pauline, an awkward girl with a fluttering heart.

114,snakejenkins,Simply Heavenly,10,11 July 2002,"Before Peter Jackson had become such a household name he made different pictures. I loved Bad Tastes as a super-indie film, which relied on jokes and gross humor to keep the pace up. It's not for the weak stomached but it is an impressive film none-the-less. Dead Alive I didn't care for on the whole, it was beautifully shot but the story didn't do much for me and neither did the over-all production. But Heavenly Creatures... now here was something that no filmgoer or maker was really expecting.The plot is a little different in and of itself, centering on the infatuation of two young girls for one another. The girls are both brilliantly played and well cast. Kate Winslet (Juliet) in her first big roll is a little off kilter and unstable. Melanie Lynsky (Pauline) is also very subdued and quiet, not the looker that Juliet is but rather something deep and hidden away. Something dangerous.The film plays itself out very slowly which is good because after you've spent much time with the girls it's hard to let them go. It's also hard to not understand a little of what they were going through and at least feel some sympathy for their plight. We travel with the two into their fantasy world (creepily realized by WETA in the form of clay models come to life) and back, having a full understanding that the fantasy world is more real and more of a true home to the girls. As time goes by the film doesn't fail as either a suspense thriller or character study. It is strong on both ends because of a taught script, unfaltering directing, and magnificent acting.  The events near the end of the film are so suspenseful that I still find them hard to watch at times. Jackson builds and builds and builds and keeps building long after I thought there would be anything left to build.The film is an astonishing look at young love and teenage reasoning. It is a sharp, almost painful, reminder of the level at which adolescents (especially the intelligent ones) think and view the world. After Columbine and Santana this film carries more weight than I think Jackson intended. But never the less, it is there. I think it was put together as a cautionary tale in some respects, and it is a caution... even more so now.",Heavenly Creatures
115,Josh20,A masterpiece plenty of imagination,10,27 May 2002,"I think Heavenly Creatures is the best movie of Peter Jackson,the aclaimed Lord of the rings' director.The movie show us the madness of two young girls in a small city of New Zeland with unforgettable shots plenty of imagination.Jackson  show shots with what is happening in girls' minds and there are  an excellent special effects.Kate Winslet(how great this girl is) and Melanie Linskey are excellent in her roles and the music(with a great score of Peter Dasent and wonderful Mario Lanza's songs)is very effective.A truly masterpiece of the 90's,i love this movie and i wish users will can see it.",Heavenly Creatures

The dream/fantasy sequences are unnecessary, distracting, and for me at least, take the pace of the film. Borovnia seemed to work so much better without being able to see it.Despite this minor grievance an exceptional film made all the better by the performances of Kate Winslett and particularly Melanie Lynskey.

117,Barnes-3,The best motion picture ever made - no argument!,10,15 May 1999,"A wonderful and astounding film, which is a contender for the best movie made in the 1990s. Beautifully written/co-produced/co-written by Peter Jackson, who selected two marvellous actresses - Melanie Lynskey and the now legendary Kate Winslet - to portray the real life Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme. I am thankful that the Academy Oscar nominated the wonderful screenplay, but still cannot believe that it was overlooked for Best Picture, Director, Actress (Lynskey and Winslet), Supporting Actress (Sarah Peirse) and Visual Effects. DEFINITELY a film you should see. And will Miramax PLEASE release the slightly longer version (seen only in New Zealand and Australia) in the UK?",Heavenly Creatures

Kate Winslet's performance is a model of just-barely-controlled hysteria, and Melanie Lynskey gives a stunning performance.  All the roles are well-handled.  The screenplay is brilliantly constructed; it is a measure of its quality that the bizarre fantasies of the girls are totally believable, even when accompanied by distracting special effects.  The cinematography, too, is gorgeous (at times perversely evoking The Sound of Music).  A truly great film.",Heavenly Creatures
119,Tet-5,Fascinating,10,27 December 1998,"Fascinating, that is the first word that comes to my mind when I think of HC. I saw this movie four or five months ago, and somehow the images just keep coming back to me. There are three reasons why HC made such a deep impression on me. At first, there is of course that fascinating story of the friendship between Pauline and Juliet. From the first scene on, you know that something terrible is going to happen. This knowledge influences your feelings while you are watching the sometimes cheerfull, joyous fantasies of the girls. It certainly gives the story an extra, awkward dimension. Second, there are these two great actresses. The characters are so important to this story, that lesser characters easily could have ruined the movie. But Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet both are just right to personate Pauline and Juliet. You feel that there is so much going on inside Pauline's mind, and that Juliet is just a bit too cheerful. The supporting actors and actresses are very good, also. Third, there are those amazing special effects. Never before have I seen such a perfect mixture of the real world and a fantasy world. I especially liked the imaginary run from Orson Welles, and the scenes in which the clay figures came alive. I don't want a give a 10 to easily, but I decided that HC is one of the few movies that really deserves this figure!",Heavenly Creatures
120,saugoof,True character development,10,16 December 2001,"This movie really shows up Hollywood on how to make a truly riveting movie. Unlike their standard fare, there are no black and white characters here, even though the movie deals with a horrible murder. This movie manages to evoke sympathy for the victim as well as the perpetrators of the crime. It's based on a true story that shook New Zealand in the 50's about two teenage girls, Pauline Rieper and Juliet Hulme, who kill Pauline's mother.The acting is some of the best I've seen. A lot of well deserved praise has been heaped on Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet as Pauline and Juliet, but my standout was Sarah Peirse as Honora Parker, who portrays the role of Pauline's mother beautifully. She gives the character just the right amount of desperation and despair as she completely runs out of ideas about what to do with Pauline.The visuals are stunning too, this movie is incredibly beautiful to look at. Particularly when the girls escape to their fantasy world, a world where knights and kings rule and the clay figurines that they model throughout the movie come to live.Hard to believe that this is the same Peter Jackson who made trashy (but incredibly good fun) movies like Bad Taste and Braindead or the Michael J. Fox vehicle The Frighteners.Heavenly Creatures got an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay which is a real shame, because it means that enough people at the academy saw it but it still didn't receive enough votes to get either one of the nominations it would have deserved. Certainly the best actress for either Lynskey or Winslet, best supporting actress for Peirse as well as direction and film for Jackson would have been well deserved.It remains one of my all time favourite movies.",Heavenly Creatures
121,playground_swing,Superb,10,30 July 2004,"I saw this movie on a whim.  I had no idea what it was about. Earlier in 1994 I had taken a chance on a movie called ""Momma's Boys"" with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it was absolutely horrible.  But this time the whim paid off.
The movie is edited and directed with a touch of genius.  The opening scene is a preview of the climatic scene in the movie.  ""Good Fellas"" also used this technique to create more suspense when the scene is repeated in the normal flow of the movie.  The direction and editing mirrors the mental state of the two girls that nearly become one. Kate Winslet's tremendous emotional depth appeals to those of us who are afflicted with the malady of hyper-sensitivity. The other girl, whose name I forget, does rather disappear in her presence, but Winslet's character is supposed to be the driving force, and Winslet, like all great actors, makes the performers around her shine. Because Winslet is the leader of the pair, it is disturbing when the lesser character leads them to do the most unthinkable -- matricide. The victim of the girls is the most tolerant of the four parents, which creates even more shock when the crime occurs. I was more unhappy with Winslet's character's parents because they don't seem to give a whit for their girl.  Feeling alone, the two girls find family with each other, but they take it a bit too deep.  They escape into a shared fantasy land where all people become moving golden statues. It is very surreal with Mario Lanza being the golden hero of the dream world and Orson Welles, the claymation villain.This movie took me to another world in a different way than I had previously experienced with any movie. I loved it.  To me it is a 10 out of 10.",Heavenly Creatures
122,kg22384,Kate Winslet is the Best.,8,8 July 2000,"Well, pretty much everything I want to say is expressed on this page already, most eloquently by Jerry Roberts from Birmingham Alabama.So to avoid repitition, I'll say my only qualm with the movie was Jackson's(or the DP Bollinger's) excessive decision to use the dolly in, which consisted of a shot starting from the waist up and ending on a close up of the face.  It begs the question, was the director or cinematographer intrigued with this shot enough to innocently use as much as they did, or were they intentionally over using it to try and emphasize some facet of the two girls perception of what was happening around them.  I don't know, but it's not hindering enough to detract from the story or the rest of the filmmaking.(Spoiler) I also especially like the bookends.  As juliet and Pauline take all the necessary steps to carry out this murder, you watch in disbelief.  The opening credits foreshadow the moment so perfectly that my heart was beating in my throat as they walked down the trail.  A wonderfully crafted cinematic moment.  That bricking was unbelievable.  Kudos on the realism, Jackson!",Heavenly Creatures
123,jakkiih,Beauty of imagination,10,7 June 2006,"Back in the days, not many of us would have believed that Peter Jackson directed something like this. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Jackson's debut, Bad Taste, and the follow-ups Braindead and Meet the Feebles are legendary splatter-classics, not even close to Heavenly Creatures.Before a quite well known trilogy Jackson directed, he also made movies named Frighteners and Forgotten Silver. Frighteners may be the lowest point of his career but Forgotten Silver is a real masterpiece. So the best works he has done are also the least known.This movie is based on a true story. It's about a murder, that happened in New-Zealand a long time ago, committed by two teen aged girls. But what is attractive in the movie, is the beautiful fantasy world these two girls have created in their minds. Girls are played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey, and they do the roles of their lifetimes. As they are homosexuals, their parents try to separate them, but it doesn't feel like an option for the girls.This is one of those films I watch every year, and the video cassette I got, is in pretty bad shape already, but I haven't found a DVD yet. When the DVD appears on stores, I'm going to buy it the second I see it.And I do hope that Peter Jackson would come back to make movies like this, instead of King Kong (which I liked, but anyway...)",Heavenly Creatures

The chemistry between the leads was sensational and totally believable, so much so that when they finally commit the dastardly deed I was truly horrified. The sense of impending doom was almost to much for me to bear but only added to my enjoyment of the film.I also enjoyed the blurring of the real world with their fantasy world, I felt these scenes were shot extremely well and helped me dive deeper into the girls disturbed world view.A twisted, shocking tale of a very disturbed friendship and the consequences when that friendship is threatened, bravo.",Heavenly Creatures
125,TheSteelHelmetReturns,One of my top ten favourite films.,10,1 October 2009,"This film caught me by surprise. I am not really keen on Peter Jackson and am not entirely interested in his fantasy or horror films even though I admit the man has a great imagination and an inspiring ability to realise his massive concepts on the screen. I respect that – but Heavenly Creatures is a completely different kind of beast of a movie that is just crazy good. Revolving around two high school girls who develop a deep, special friendship, Kate Winslet gives the performance of her life as a very charming new student and her delivery really makes you want to be her friend. Jackson is really able to control the audience's responses as the story progresses – you feel a sense of sadness when you realise that this friendship is going to end very badly and then with that final shot, absolutely dread and horror as you wake up and realise how far gone these two girls were in their own fantasy world. I also have respect for Jackson for crossing over his interest in horror and fantasy into this drama – the make up and special effects are really cool and complement the actors as the line between reality and fantasy is blurred. It really helps in getting the audience to have an experience that mirrors what Melanie Lynesky feels throughout the film rather than just being a detached observer. If I had to pick my ""most"" favourite film from this list I can easily see Days of Heaven or Heavenly Creatures being the first film I think of. Watch it today!!!",Heavenly Creatures

127,Æthelred,Perhaps the best true-crime film ever,10,5 September 1999,"One of the most chilling true-crime movies ever made, Heavenly Creatures depicts the extraordinary obsession with each other of two Christchurch, New Zealand, girls--an obsession that eventually drives them to murder one of their mothers.  The crime took place in 1954, when Christchurch was a bucolic outpost of Anglo-Australasian culture, and the movie captures the shock that the crime's enormity caused.One of Heavenly Creatures' many achievements is its portrayal of intentional murder as a base, obscene act.  The actual murder scene is almost unwatchable.  In mainstream Hollywood movies, murders tend to be stylized, and the viewer sees them at a remove from the horror.  By contrast, Heavenly Creatures contains no similar mediation, and the moviegoer is psychologically placed directly in the ghastly view of events, without a gloss of any sort.",Heavenly Creatures

Just be sure to call it brilliant.  Peter Jackson is in the company of my favorite directors (along with John Waters, Tim Burton and Matthew Bright), and he has done some amazing films.  But even with a million dollar epic like Lord of the Rings, he can never top this movie. This movie places him directly on top of his career.  He cannot go higher, because to do so would cause my brain to explode.  He has inspired me to see the world in a completely different way.  Not different like killing my mom will make all my problems go away, but different like seeing the magic in everyday things.  He proves that you're never too old to have an active imagination.  Love these girls.  Despite their problems, they are magical, wonderful, heavenly creatures to love and cherish.  Be happy, rent this movie, be happier.  Actually the end is a little depressing, but once you see it 30 or 40 times, you'll start to feel happier about it.",Heavenly Creatures
129,SenoritaTorres,A wonderful piece of cinema-full marks to Peter Jackson!,10,23 February 2007,"I actually first watched this movie about eight years ago. I was and still am a big fan of Kate Winslet and as this was her very first film and she was only nineteen when it was made, I was interested in seeing how she started her film career. So I watched the film-and ended up watching one of the best, most moving, and most hauntingly fantastic films I've seen. To be honest I was very shocked to find that it was based on true events. It made me sad (but not completely surprised, given the events of today) to think that something like this actually happened, committing by teenage girls besides anything.Kate Winslet was amazing in her debut, as was Melanie Lynskey. Their interaction and chemistry on-screen was brilliant, portraying the schoolgirls Pauline (Yvonne, Charles, Gina) and Juliet (Deborrah) as being young girls who find they are 'soulmates' though from totally different classes. Juliet is British-the daughter of a successful, rich doctor and an attractive marriage counsellor, but there's a downside to her situation. She has the money and the house and the material things but she does not have the thing she craves-her parents' love. She is the typical spoilt little rich girl, abandoned by her parents regularly, left to fend for herself and in turn becoming rather rebellious. She clearly sees Pauline as her freedom, as someone she can relate to and have fun with. Pauline, bored with her dull, monotonous life and possessive mother, also sees Juliet as a freedom and the two friends soon become inseparable.I have never enjoyed watching the events of a film unfold so much-it was unpredictable, it was scary in places (the clay figures of Borovnia and the violent son of Charles and Deborrah, Diello, slaying everybody stick in the mind) and it was also poignant. I didn't feel sympathy for the girls, it was difficult to, but the film left me wondering how on earth they could have gotten so desperate as to commit such a vile act against another person. There was something very different about the two girls-they had a strange psychic connection-they truly believed that this 'Fourth World' existed and that they would join their favourite film stars in a place beyond Heaven. As the film progresses and you realise just how deep into their own little fantasy world they are, you begin to also wonder about their clearly disintegrating mental state-something in which their parents mistakenly believe is simply homosexuality. While the girls do experience sex together, what they have together is something far more sinister and far more powerful-something both sets of parents realise too late.'Heavenly Creatures' isn't like other films, in my opinion. It isn't an epic, and it probably hasn't even been seen by wide audiences. It's an independent, possibly low-budget offering by the fantastic Peter Jackson. Lord of the Rings it definitely isn't. But it offers the viewer something else. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie needs to sit down and watch it. It's not one to be ignored.",Heavenly Creatures

131,hdmail,Teen angst gone awry,10,7 September 2000,"""Heavenly Creatures"" has succeeded in portraying the extremes of young adulthood as I myself saw them at that age.  Everything was either perfectly lovely or perfectly horrendous, and there was not a grown-up in the world who could understand this.  I didn't go to the lengths that Pauline and Juliet did, but I remember the emotions well, and this film brought them back with amazing vividness and empathy.  The brilliance of the script, direction, performances, and special effects combine to create an aura of realism, even in the fantasy scenes, that often is lacking in stories based on truth.The tragedies in ""Heavenly Creatures"" are abundant, but the most dismaying, to me, was the fact that two young women felt themselves to be so misunderstood, so different, and so unfairly maligned, that they took drastic measures to prevent their separation.  Their master plan was thwarted by real complications that neither of them had considered.  Pauline and Juliet were otherwise incredibly intelligent, perhaps geniuses, and they let emotion cloud their beings to the point where they committed an unforgivable act rather than even try to find a logical solution or compromise.  Juliet Hulme is now known as mystery author Anne Perry, whose books are well-written and imaginative, but not as extraordinary and magical as her adolescent masterpieces.  Very little is known about where Pauline Parker is today, and what she is doing.  If Pauline's and Juliet's families had not attempted to forcibly part them, chances are they would eventually have produced legendary literature together.

They are highly educated.

It's absolutely false. The only possible reason was the needed signature to obtain a passport, but is rather an excuse. She wants to kill her, not because the problem that she uses to convince Juliet, but only because she hate her mother. Pauline is mentally disturbed. The day of the crime, in the house, Juliet is talking about the crime and the victim but Pauline only talk about the characters of her novel.It's true that both,Juliet and Pauline, cannot clearly separate reality from imagination. In fact, they are mostly living in an imaginary world. But Pauline is really the criminal mind and the real killer. Juliet is convinced by her lover to do that.

This is one of them.After viewing the movie, I felt very compelled to research it on the internet, to find everything I could about the real story and compare it. The accuracy is absolutely amazing!  I have never seen a movie so true to the facts.  From the accents, to the pink gemstone, to shooting everything exactly where it took place, even in the girls' old classroom right down to the seating arrangements.  The only scene not shot that way was the murder scene, which was done 100 yards down the road because the director found it disturbing to shoot there.  It is easy to get swept up with the girls in their fantasy world.  They seem so innocent and enchanting, it's almost impossible to see the horror coming that they caused.I find it interesting that Juliet Hulme (now Anne Perry) joined the Mormon church after her jail sentence.  The religion is filled with fantasy, gods and goddesses, and various kingdoms of heaven.  This is still very fitting of her personality.You will be hard pressed to find such an intense bond between two girls in any movie, although it is frightening and unhinging to watch.

These qualities make Heavenly Creatures by far one of the most unique films ever created. The plot itself is suspenseful, with breaks of quirky humour. You will often find yourself laughing despite yourself.This true story of two obsessive teenage girls --Juliet and Pauline-- trapped by their deep love for one another sparkles with such wonder, it is almost indescribable. At a time when lesbianism is frowned upon--the 1950's--the girls become extremely close, both mentally and physically, and are accused by their parents of being lesbians. They know they will inevitably be separated when Juliet's parents leave the country and take her with them, but the girls will not have it. In order to stay together, they devise an unbelievable plan that will end up separating them forever.

139,harry-pompis,Heavenly Creatures Indeed (Innocence),8,7 July 2019,"I approached this movie on my quest for finding the aesthetic. Having in mind the beautiful cinematography on TLOTR directed by Peter Jackson I tried to trace back the talent to his first movie I was surprised to find curiously enough that this picture was filmed mostly on the same location, New Zeland; One can understand why this director finds a home for the magic in his movies in these Islands. Neither Peter Jackson nor New Zeland disappointed on fulfilling my expectations and soothing my eye with the most beautiful tones and pictures. Set in the 1950's the costumes and overall scenography were magnificent and very well put.

140,sweetmystique32,I didn't watch the whole thing but I don't think I missed much,3,11 February 2013,"I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.",Heavenly Creatures
141,carljosephswan,How The Average Teen Turns Into A Killer & Social Pariah,10,15 June 2021,"Peter Jackson's ""Heavenly Creatures"" is one of my favorite queer horror films. Based on true events, the movie concerns a murder carried out by two young girls (ages 15 and 16) who used a rock to crush the skull of one of their mothers. The girls served 5 years in prison before getting paroled - under the condition that they never meet again. The Parker Hulme Case is well known in New Zealand, occupying a prominent place in the nation's history of notorious crimes.Jackson decided to dramatize the story because he felt it was gravely misunderstood. When the murder happened back in 1952, criminal psychology was still a primitive science in New Zealand. Lacking a rational explanation for the girls' actions, the media branded them as evil, lesbian psychopaths - a stigma that endured for decades. Jackson's film discredits that stigma, portraying the girls as two young outsiders, both highly intelligent with active imaginations, who lean on each other to cope with unhappy realities in their lives (clueless parents, tyrannical teachers, stifling social norms). The girls share a powerful bond, punctuated by long embraces and awkward kisses. Whether that bond is sexual or platonic in nature should be nobody's business. Unfortunately, it was a different time. Young women who engaged in socially unacceptable sexual activities - including lesbian practices - could be punished (e.g. Lesbians were sometimes sent to psych hospitals for frontal lobe surgery, which essentially turned them into vegetables and destroyed their lives). Disturbed by their closeness, the girls' parents decided to separate them for ""their own good."" Only then, when faced with the terrifying prospect of losing each other, did the girls plan and commit murder.This movie really moved me. Perhaps because I see so much of myself in its lead characters. I was a loner and a dreamer, and I was bullied for being gay. Still, my situation wasn't so bad. I had a supportive family and small circle of friends. Plus, prevailing attitudes about homosexuality were much more accepting than what existed in the 50s.

Set in Christchurch, New Zealand in the 1950s, it tells the true-life story of two teenage girls  Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet)  who form a dangerously obsessive relationship that ultimately leads to a shocking and tragic conclusion.Not only was this a major turning point for director Jackson, it also introduced cinema-goers to the talents of the beautiful Kate Winslet, who impresses in her big-screen debut. The cast is uniformly impressive, however, with the relatively unknown Melanie Lynskey giving an outstanding performance in the central role. The direction and pace of the film ensure that the interest is sustained throughout, with many funny moments in the early scenes, and as the two girls immerse themselves in a world of fantasy and make-believe, Jackson creates a fairytale world, filling the screen with surreal and hallucinatory images. Although the film has always been acclaimed by critics, it went largely unnoticed by mainstream audiences on its release, possibly due to the more 'arthouse' qualities of the film, and the lack of big name stars. If you haven't seen it, however, I urge you to do so - forthwith! Balancing moments of comedy, drama, fantasy and, ultimately, shocking and brutal violence, this is one of the most satisfying movie experiences one could ask for. Truly, a modern classic.",Heavenly Creatures
143,TheDarkStar,wonderful,9,8 August 1998,"Unknown films of actors/actresses who turned famous later are sometimes horrible and sometimes great. This one is definitely wonderful. Its charming way of transferring the girls´ fantasies has more credibility than any other film I have seen. Juliet and Pauline are that persuasive and the cuts and transitions are excellent. The difficult sequences when dream and reality are melted together and torn apart again are so hard to manage and so brilliantly done. It is not a movie with much of a direction or moral in itself, it simply shows the relationship between the girls and the families so one might nearly feel like Pauline or Juliet. Anybody who likes movies with feelings but without a melodramatic TITANIC style will have endless pleasure watching one of the greatest movies of the decade with a Kate Winslet (and a Kate Lynskey) who is persuasive like she never was in Titanic.",Heavenly Creatures
144,Leslie-12,The best movie I have seen in the 20th Century,10,3 July 1999,"I have to say. This movie is the best movie that I will see this century. Before seeing it, I would have never had suspected this movie to have such a profound impact that it did.What more can you ask for?Brilliant acting, an outstanding screenplay, brilliant characters, incredible filming and effects, and a need to keep watching the movie because every time you do you catch something you didn't catch before.What makes this movie even more interesting and eerie is that it is a true story (to a certain extent) but done like a beautiful child like fantasy gone horrifically wrong.My thumb goes way up to Melanie and Kate who have done two of the top ten best acting jobs ever and a supporting cast that is absolutely amazing.It is rare to find a movie like but I hope that someday I will get to see a better one.",Heavenly Creatures
145,JulyHizon 18 male,THOUGHT PROVOKING,10,1 April 2001,"As of right now, society has little tolerance for homosexual behavior. And as we go further back on the human timeline, this tolerance gets less and less so in the movie's setting, it is treated like a desease. The two girls in this film live in their own little world together. And the more time they spend together, the further away they drift from society. It's as if they're mutually-schizophrenic. They create a fantasy world of their own in which they're the only ones aloud to enter. They would sometimes walk around seeing unicorns and medieval castles as if they're actually there. This movie reminds us of how people behave differently when they are together, and how they would do things that they could only do with the back-up of each others confidence. Each of the girls is nothing when she is by herself, but when they're together they're stronger. We realize that when two people are the perfect soulmates, they could live inside each others' mind. In this case, they fit together so well that they act like one unit when they're together. Kinda like Beavis and Butthead, who are like one person altogether. .....HEAVENLY CREATURES is the perfect love story!",Heavenly Creatures
146,kiwi43,So Brilliantly Clever,9,23 February 2008,"This movie really brings back the memories of NZ in the 1950's. The case caused a furore in the newspapers (tv was years away). In our house the descriptions of the trial were removed from the paper before the young teenagers in the house could read them and learn of such perverse goings on, and it was not really until I attended University in Christchurch in the sixties, that I became familiar with the case. At some stage most students took the trip to Victoria Park to "" see where it happened"".Peter Jackson has bought it all back brilliantly, from the portrayal of the Girls' High School at the start, in the contrast between the homes of the two girls, to the fatal outing.Am adding to this review (2011) as I have just read the newly published book, So Brilliantly Clever (a a quote from Pauline's diary) by Peter Graham, which adds a great deal of background to the story, as well as revealing what happened later to both girls. For fans, a great read and answers a lot of questions. Rather disturbing too to read of the girls' smirking & giggling through the court proceedings.",Heavenly Creatures

149,rnakamur,Extraordinary Thriller,10,14 October 2008,"We begin with newsreel footage of idyllic 1950s Christchurch, New Zealand, with lake rowers, colorful gardens, and well-to-do men and women cheerfully tottering about town.Then come the screams, amplifying until we cut to a steadicam shot running through trees, then to a house where a woman emerges to see investigate the noises. She sees teenage girls Juliet Hulme and Pauline (Reiper) Parker emerge frantically from the woods, covered head-to-toe in blood. ""It's Mummy! She's been terribly hurt!"" shouts Pauline. Meanwhile Juliet nearly collapses in desperation, crying ""PLEASE! HELP US!"" This is the opening of Peter Jackson's shocking, extraordinary film which effectively blends modern drama with fantasy and visceral horror. It's the gateway project that evolved Jackson from an inventive low-brow horror director (Bad Taste, Dead-Alive) to the premiere auteur of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""King Kong."" Speculate all you want about others, but he is this generation's Spielberg, a visionary filmmaker with ambition, depth, and a musician's ear for pacing. (One only wishes Sam Raimi of ""Evil Dead"" fame could have blossomed the same way).The film tells the tale of two 15-year-old girls, the socially awkward Pauline Reiper (a shy, chubby Melanie Lynskey) and the new girl in town-- frenetic, bipolar, and incorrigibly imaginative Juliet Hulme (an intoxicatingly charismatic Kate Winslet, in her debut). They're polar opposites, Pauline dreadfully timid and Juliet vivacious and without boundaries. It's precisely why they become inseparable and form an unhealthy codependency on one another, particularly since they lack other friends. Spending late nights dreaming up fantasy worlds and role-playing lascivious engagements with famous singers and movie stars, the girls become utterly ensconced in a world of pure illusion that no one-- especially their parents-- can tap into.Jackson takes this material and goes after it with full steam, complete with dazzling visuals like enormous butterflies, full-motion clay figurines, and CGI facial morphing-- all the more impressive in 1995, when CGI was just beginning to surface in cinema. But it's just as impressive to see Jackson carefully weave these innovative effects into a tale of adolescent jealousy without falling to the temptation of reverting back to horror/fantasy. Not once does he show an effects scene where we lose tone of the story and feel like something is funny or gross for the sake of being so.It's precisely why this film works, and why the startling conclusion is so deeply disturbing. We know every element of terror is just fantasy until we encounter the real thing. And when it happens, we see it exactly the way Pauline and Juliet did. Horrifyingly. Here, murder is truly horrific in ways most of us would never want to experience in real life.This is one of those films I viewed without expectations, but discovered I couldn't turn my eyes away from it. I found myself fully alert, holding my breath, keeping my jaw from dropping throughout its 100 minute running time. The rigorous pacing by editor Jamie Selkirk, sparkling photography by Alun Bollinger, a spellbinding score by Peter Dasent, coupled with Fran Walsh/Jackson's gutsy script and Jackson's energetic camera-work, instantly made me a fan of rogue art-house cinema. It couldn't have pleased me more to see Winslet move on to become a star and Jackson earn an Oscar for ""The Return of the King"" a decade later.I recently saw the unrated extended cut on DVD, and I recommend the original version. The addition of several scenes, particularly ones where Pauline imagines gory ways to off her parents, do precisely what I felt the first cut restrained from doing. The original version is best because it takes itself seriously.And it ought to, because the crime, while fascinating, is no laughing matter. It's shocking, tragic, yet in many ways completely understandable. We spend a few hours getting drawn into the world of young Pauline and Juliet, and we can totally see how they've gotten seduced by their own spell. Jackson shows us how an untamed imagination can be vast, menacing and even deadly. Roger Ebert describes the climax as ""a mob of only two people where each is waiting for the other to yell stop."" He's absolutely right. Here, the terror lies in the blood on our hands, and our inability to stop the inevitable from happening.It's a thinking man's horror movie, a thriller of spectacle, and a dramatic tour de force.",Heavenly Creatures
150,Milla-M,Charmingly disturbing.,7,27 April 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***I saw this film recently, a couple of days ago, Friday or Thursday night methinks (sorry, i've been really busy and I my memory is kind of messed up). Anyways, I was really interested in Lord of the Rings and I found out that the director for Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson) also directed Heavenly Creatures...which you probably already know. So when I discovered that Heavenly Creatures was on I thought I'd give it a watch.
The story is basically about two rather different girls who form an extremely strong rapport, which is both touching and very unsettling. They become so immersed in their extraordinary friendship that they start to live in a fantasy land, a paradise, and soon they realise that the paradise wouldn't exist without eachother. Between their experimental lesbian encounters and driftings into fantastical realms, one of the girl's mothers stands in there way, threatening to separate them which eventually leads to her horrific demise, at the hands of her daughter and her daughter's best friend...The acting in this film was excellent, one of the film's strong points. Melanie Lynskey did well pulling off her subdued character (Pauline Rieper) and Kate Winslet was excellent in her flashy, energetic role (Juliet Hulme).The directing was really good as well, the seamless transitions between reality and fantasy were amazing and the opening to the film (similar to that of The Hole) was excellent and captivated me straight away. The music in the film was kind of bland and didn't really stand out but I guess it wasn't really supposed to anyway?I found the film deeply disturbing, I don't like the idea that two people can be so consumed in each other that they'll murder one of their own mothers to stay close to eachother. I liked the dialogue and to be honest I think the two girls make a cute couple, it is evident in the film how right they are for eachother, how they slot together like two pieces of a jig-saw puzzle.The biting irony at the ending was bitter and also one of the most disturbing parts of the film is that ... it makes you think that, from the two girl's point of view, murdering Pauline's mother Honoria Rieper (Sarah Peirse) was sickeningly just. The film exploits both girls and gets inside Pauline's dark mind through the use of her diary.I thoroughly enjoyed the film however I felt that in some parts it was slow paced and I couldn't help myself feeling disgusted in some parts. The fact that this film is based on real events made this even worse... I know it was 1994 but some of the special effects looked shoddy and I think the whole lesbian aspect of the film needn't have been included.At the end ... I'm not quite sure. During the film I felt a whirlwind of emotions; awe, disgust, at times laughter, joy and fear.I'm not sure now if I deeply regret watching this disturbing and depressing film ... or if I am really thankful I saw a brilliant, intriguing film. I must admit though, it is overrated (probably due to the controversy surrounding the film) and I expected a little more but overall it was a good film.B+Milla.",Heavenly Creatures
151,TCall2004,I love this movie,10,7 December 2006,"I felt sorry for poor Juliet Hulme. Her father, Dr. Hulme, was a cold fish and her mother, Hilda, was self-centered beyond belief. They left their daughter at a very young age in a sanitarium for five years and never visited her? How cruel!Honora Parker had nerve calling her daughter Pauline a ""tart"" when she was living with a man to whom she was never married for years - Wendy and Pauline were not their only children. A boy, Herbert, born before Wendy lived only days and a daughter, Rosemary, born after Pauline, was so severely retarded she had to be institutionalized at the age of 3. Having given birth to no less than four children by a man who was still married to another woman, Honora had no room to cast aspersions on her daughter's morals.Herbert Reiper was thick as a plank - ""unhealthy"" meant ""not getting any fresh air.""Why did that boarder, John, keep pushing himself on Pauline, when he had to know that she was only 14 years old? And why were Herbert and Honora so ready to believe the worst of their own daughter when John was old enough to have known better? He should have been the one blamed, being the adult.The psychiatrist was so laughable - someone would ""outgrow"" being gay?Both sets of parents made a huge mistake trying to keep the girls apart - opposition only makes things worse.Not that Honora Parker deserved to be murdered for that.",Heavenly Creatures

153,SD-4,Two girls in crisis--and not a country in crisis of ethical patterns.,6,13 July 1999,"Albeit the actual satisfaction one sees and feels in the cinematographic parts of the film, its special effects and the excellent cast, there are several problems that stop me from grading this movie as high a standing as the plot possibly deserves.The movie is an attempt to demonstrate a country in crisis, with `ancient' ethical patterns pulverized, innovating concepts preceding their time and credited with gloomy attitude as well as misunderstanding from the society.A non-conventional friendship of two teenage girls, observation from different aspects on the same theme, different aspects of view against extant axioms of ethics.  In fact--a whole world against two teenage girls. And they love it. The girls flee to their own world (""The Fourth World""), which is supported by several excellent effects.However, the acting itself reminds somewhat a parody on a dramatic film, especially the beginning of it.  All the dialogue scenes between the two girls seem to be unrealistic, and the (too) sullen world of one (Pauline--Melanie Lynskey) versus the (too) cheerful reality of the other (Juliet--Kate Winslet).  Too many emotions involved in the dialogues, which transform them to a somewhat unreliable form of acting.We are presented two polarized worlds, but they are too polar.  Everything is too flamboyant, and therefore: surreal.  Perhaps the idea of such acting deserves attention, but in my opinion, in this film, it failed.The film is very unusual for the spectator, and uses patterns that are scarce in modern movies.  Some people I have discussed the movie with argued that the dialogues in the movie are literally swan of an insane person which have been written down, or an attempt to show a parody on a relationship drama.  I disagree with such a decisive overreaction, but it's partially correct.  Although the film  is  based on a true story, it is very difficult to believe in view of the sometimes wretched acting.  From the aspect of realism, it's a failure, and therefore the titles in the beginning and the end which give the film a grip of reality are not felicitous.There is no side that can be interpreted in the film, neither the girls (wicked, warped, going against the entire world, against ethical patterns that are not out-of-date even today...), nor the surrounding world (scorn of homosexuality, strict discipline, parent--child relationship...).  It is somewhat difficult to understand the characters' actions, because the acting does not appoint them `evaluations'--not that it is bad, but the characters are not properly `explained' to the spectator.  That definitely ill-treats the film.  Aside from that, the philosophical ideas behind ""The Fourth World"" in the movie sometimes don't correlate with the actions and dialogues of the characters--and that is a problem of the plot, without a doubt.Bottom line: we have created ourselves a world, and no obstacle will stop us!

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't uncomfortable, but the best films are ones that push the boundaries of your comfort zone. Jackson created a very edgy film here, one that shows the cruelty of the world in the eyes of young women when they feel like they're in a no win situation. The audience moves in and out of the fantasy world they create with startling ease, evidence of Jackson's deft handling. Their desperation is a result of the alienation that all young people feel at one time. When they meet each other, they find an escape. The relationship becomes too intense for their parents to handle and they make an attempt to separate them, believing that lesbianism is a form of psychosis. The murder of Pauline's mother is never justified, but we can't really hate the two girls either, well at least not Kate Winslet's character. There's so much that can be said here, but the most compelling thing is that these events really happened. Heavenly Creatures is based on one of New Zealand's most sensationalized murders. The lead actresses give fine performances and Jackson proves that he can do strange and wonderful things with any material he is given.",Heavenly Creatures

I have only seen it once, in a television screening, and I think it is a very haunting film, a beautiful and powerful piece of work. The performances by the then unknown Kate Winslet and her girlfriend are so realistic, so gripping... It just makes you very sad to think this more or less really happened. I must admit that I do not like the other films Peter Jackson has made (Brain Dead, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles) as I am absolutely not into gore. The end of Heavenly Creatures is also quite gory, but since it is done in a very realistic style and no more brutal than what we see in TV series nowadays, it fits.

158,dusan711,Kate Winslet is Oscar worthy!,10,18 May 2005,"This film is astonishing. Really, I rank it tied in first place as the best film of 1994, shared with PULP FICTION.Peter Jackson's masterpiece (thougth I love the Lord of the Rings films) is definitely HEAVENLY CREATURES. It's a challenging film, very difficult to watch at times. But it brilliantly captures the brightly burning, constantly changing, wild emotions of these two intelligent and creative but seriously damaged teenage girls.Sarah Peirse as the mother is incredible in her role. Melanie Lynskey reaches such a depth with her character...I actually think it's a bit frightening how good she is. And Kate Winslet...ahhh KATE WINSLET! At first glance...the performance might just be blown off as over the top and amateur. But that's only at first glance. Look closer, and stay with it, and you will see what amazing things she has done with this character. It's a remarkable achievement unlike any other acting I've seen in any film of this kind, which is to say a true life crime thriller.Heavenly Creatures is, and I say this with absolute certainty, the best true life crime thriller ever made. Because instead of trying to be a classic thriller with cheap tricks, Peter Jackson gets you inside the twisted minds of these two girls, and whether you hate them in the end or not, you completely understand why these girls did what they did...and that it was doomed from the start. Kate Winslet is just brilliant. WHY wasn't she given every award under the sun for this?!?!??!",Heavenly Creatures
159,pgreyy,"Not just for teens, this is...well...awesome...",10,16 January 1999,"I understand why teenage girls would like this movie--the thrilling rush of new found deep friendship tied together with nascent sexuality and all that comes with it...the defying of the confines of the world around them...the incredible power of unfettered creativity and self-delusional belief...What's amazing is that a jaded thirty-something man like myself would consider it to be his favorite film of all time. Peter Jackson shows a deftness in handling interpersonal characterizations and blending in amazing special effects in a way that seems so natural...so fluid...that you while you're awed by what you see, you're not so aware of the process that you're distracted.  The oh-so-1993 effect of ""morphing"" is used better here than any other film (save, perhaps, Terminator 2--but in that movie, the morphing WAS the film...when here, it is merely one element.)The direction is exemplary.  The cinematography is awe inspiring.  The script is sharp.  The acting...down the line...is superb.  Melanie Lynskey delivers a brave performance--giddy, childish, frightening, sexual, clouded...  She's everything Christina Ricci pretends to be.  Kate Winslet--hyper-bright and wonderful...her performance here reminds you that her ""Titanic"" performance was ""sunk"" (sorry!) by the extremely poor dialogue she was given.  Her character's overly cheerful demeanor is a mask that covers her disappointment in her parents--but it's extended so far that it no longer seems like a mask...it seems to be a force of nature that drags Lynskey's Pauline along for a dangerous ride...a ride that Winslet's Juliet is in no position to control.  There are crisp performances from all of the supporting cast as well.Jackson should be listed with Gilliam and even Lynch when it comes to directors who can achieve a glorious, if dark, vision.  The fact that Jackson's movies (save for ""Meet the Feebles"") are mainstream accessible--in ways that Lynch, especially, could barely consider (although ""The Frighteners"" was painfully overlooked by the US market)--makes me wish that he'd try his hand at more mainstream material.Imagine what a Peter Jackson ""Titanic"" would have been like...and compare that to what a James Cameron ""Heavenly Creatures"" would have been like and you get my point.",Heavenly Creatures
160,valmont_56,A MASTER PIECE,10,23 September 2000,"I knew this movie was good, just by when I saw the trailer. Gory, cult-film maker Peter Jackson turned the tables by making this highly dramatic film of the true case of two girls murdering ones mother after getting threatened separation. Melanie Lynskey plays the moody, shy Pauline Parker, who meets up with cheeky, rich Juliet Hulme played well and convincing by Kate Winslet, though I thought the real excellent performance was Lynskey. They instantly bind together creating a fantasy world where they escape from their problems. Things go from interesting to creepy, when they start a plot after both parents tell them they have to be separated. They try all sorts of things but eventually they realize they are beaten they decide to kill Pauline's mother who they feel is the main reason for their troubles (when really it's Juliet's dad). All sorts of interesting things are shown through out the film, such as a rape scene with Orson Welles, and clay figurines that come alive.

Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.",Heavenly Creatures

Lots of chatter, unrealistic actions by the characters (I know it's ""based on a true story"", but I'm sure the true story is far more interesting), and very slow pacing makes this movie suck.

163,Peaches311,My All-Time Favorite Movie,10,1 June 2003,"I must preface this review by saying that ""Heavenly Creatures"" is my all-time favorite movie.  I say that mainly because certain aspects of it remind me of my own youth.  I am not a lesbian or a murderer, but I enjoy writing and had a few close friends when I was younger that shared my passion.  We created characters and whole worlds, and yes, even the occassional alter ego.  Watching ""Heavenly Creatures"" brought a tear to my eye because I could relate to the close friendship of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker.  It also made me cry because of where they ended up and also how unfairly their friendship was viewed by their families.Every time I watch this movie, I want to jump into the TV and stop the characters from their heinous actions.  I want the movie, and their true lives, to end up differently, but of course that never will happen.  This is a bittersweet film that is filled with sharp dialogue (some of it coming from Pauline Parker's actual journal), as well as amazing actors.  I think Melanie Lynsky, who plays Pauline, has yet to get the recognition she deserves for her awesome acting skills, and Kate Winslet is 100 times better in ""Heavenly Creatures"" than she was in Titanic (the movie for which everyone seems to remember).To sum this up, ""Heavenly Creatures"" is a unique and incredible film that will tug at your heartstrings while breaking your heart at the same time.",Heavenly Creatures

Minor Spoiler: I have also fallen off (while drunk) the bridge that Juliet is standing on when Pauline first visits her at her beautiful home. This is a fantastic movie that brings alive the fantasy world of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker/Reaver as their obsession with each other grows and eventually lead to the murder of Pauline's mother. Peter Jackson's inimitable vision and imaginations make the girls fantasy world appreciable for the viewer. The murder scene is appropriately horrible and is devoid of any stylisation which makes the murder seem believable mundane and painful.",Heavenly Creatures

As their friendship grow, even bordering on homosexuality, and their fantasy land Borovnia seems real to them just as the real world outside, their parents grow concerned and try to separate the pair. Resenting this, they plan revenge on one of the mothers. Their form of revenge...ultimate...Murder!What sets the film apart is the fantasy world the girls create - the world named Borovnia. Kate quotes ""I'm going to the fourth world. it's a sort of a heaven, only better, coz there aren't any christians!""The fantasies get darker and darker as the girls get separated and the movie gets more and more difficult to watch...but you can't tear ur eyes away from the scenes coz Peter Jackson creates a 'what will happen next' with delicious frissions created by the girls restlessness underneath.The film deserves to be seen not just once but more than that, if not for all the above reasons, for Kate winslet's performance. As the smarter of the two girls, she dominates every frame and lights up each one of them. Pity about TITANIC, as she got the maximum adulation for the worst role that she did in her career. Her performance in Heavenly Creatures,being her debut too, deserved an Oscar.",Heavenly Creatures
166,jordi_smilo,"Horrible as hell, but beautiful as heaven",10,9 May 2005,"It's really amazing how a story can be horrible and beautiful at the same time. ""Heavenly Creatures"" is a movie that proves it really can.The story is full of fantasy, drama, friendship and strange elements. The combination of personal drama, extraordinary fantasy and suspense thriller keeps you interested.Besides the story itself, there are also other factors that makes this movie extremely worth watching. Director Peter Jackson is pulling the strings the whole movie, and his direction is like the cherry on the strawberry pie: it's an extra 'golden touch' on ""Heavenly Creatures"".And we must not forget the great acting. Sarah Pierse is fine as Mrs Rieper, and Clive Merrison is cast-iron in his role as Mr Hulme. And then there are the two unique leading girls, Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet. Lynskey does very well in her very complicated and isolated role as Pauline Rieper, but Winslet exceeds everybody with her fantastic, compelling and terrifying role as Juliet Hulme.The special effects are really ""special"" and contribute to the film's pretensions, and also the music does his bit. The movie gives you a little nasty feeling in the stomach, but at the end you know, that you've just seen a really unique film.To me, ""Heavenly Creatures"" was a unforgettable watching experience. Just a quarter ago, I've ordered the DVD of this film. And I can't wait to see ""Heavenly Creatures"" again!",Heavenly Creatures
167,asherlines,Disturbing,7,19 July 2015,"I gave this film a 7 because it portrays the relationship the girls had very well. The fantasy world was very nicely combined with reality and all that happened is very accurate. The acting was good and the writing was too. The problem with this film is that it is a little too disturbing. I do not know how Jackson wanted us to feel but I was not happy for the two main girls and did not actually like them very much. I was kind of on the family's side rather than the teenagers' side. Also, there seemed to be an unrealistic age gap between the two girls with Pauline looking about 15 and Winslet looking about 22. They should have also shown more of the school life; how they were seen by their peers and teachers. On the whole a 'wow' kind of film, worth a watch.",Heavenly Creatures

175,vaughn-21,The most underrated and overlooked film I know of,10,17 December 2001,"For whatever reason this one fell through the cracks and it is a loss for its makers but even more so for all of those who have not seen it. I do not throw around praise but I would say this is one of the greatest, and certainly most underrated, films of all time. It is based on the true story of two girls who in 1950s New Zealand murder one of their mothers in an attempt to prevent their separation. This fact gives the epilogue an almost unbearable amount of tragic irony. At any rate the most compelling aspect of the story is the way in which it portrays a relationship from it's innocent beginnings, to an intimate friend ship to a sexual and in a way psychotic bond (the girls share a fantasy world populated by characters from the stories they write) between the two girls. This is a film that should be watched by anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Writing direction and acting are all nearly impeccable and I dare say it is the most convincing portrayal of love ever in a film.",Heavenly Creatures
176,king_in_crimson,Masterful,10,18 March 2004,"I tried to watch this movie without any thought of the 'Lord of The Rings' Trilogy, as I knew this would alter my perception of this film. I think I was not quite successful in doing this, since LoTR is my favorite movie trilogy ever. But, all in all, it did not change the fact that this is certainly one of the best films I've ever seen.If you consider the 'horror' genre as a subtype of the 'Fantasy' genre, it is possible to say that Peter Jackson is one of the greatest directors ever to deal with Fantasy. He has a very peculiar way of defining fantasy, which is seen in all his movies, from Braindead to The Return of the King. He abolishes what one would expect from the term, and creates a world where 'fantasy' is REALITY, in every way.This approach is particularly adamant in this picture, which deals with a fact that really took place in New Zealand. Two girls develop a relationship of affection that becomes a little too serious, as they start living in their own world, which becomes pathologically real and will be defended by both of the girls at whatever costs from those who trespass against it.The art direction and cinematography are nothing less than stupendous (as one would expect from the first class team that conducted the making of the Lord of The Rings movies) and the screenplay is yet another masterpiece from Fran Walsh. The result is fantastic. 10/10",Heavenly Creatures
177,j23091979,Sometimes life just does'nt cut it.,10,1 February 2003,"An excellent potrayal of two 'MAD' young girls shown from a somewhat empathetic point of view. You can't help but be sucked into the girls world of fantasy as im sure many can testify that sometimes life just does not cut it.  Why be in a world where all that surrounds you is convention and boredom?  Kate Winslets character charms the viewer from the first instance she is introduced to the scene.  She is young, vibrant and charismatic. A spur of the moment type gal - larger than life - the best friend everyone wishes they had or wishes they could be.  However beneath this front is a darker side to her character (I blame the parents), this side can be seen in the character Paul quite evidently.  As the two become closer there characters merge into one, it becomes hard to see where one begins and one ends.  I feel it shouts out to an innocent time before the imagination was blocked out by the tediousness and preditability of adult life - childhood.",Heavenly Creatures
178,Ravengrey26,Peter Jackson's Masterpiece,10,25 July 2005,"This is one of those films which warrants multiple viewings, and not just because it as an excellent film, but because you will be so immersed into the story at first viewing, that you really need more viewings to see all that Peter Jackson has done here.First off, Peter Jackson, make no mistake, is genius. He won well-deserved praise for LOTR, partly because it was such a mammoth undertaking, but many people do not know he was nominated for an Oscar previously with Fran Walsh for the Heavenly Creatures screenplay. This film was quite a departure for him at the time, and that is important considering how completely effective the film is.There will always be people who don't understand Heavenly Creatures, and also those who take issue with some of its thematic elements, but one must remember how dedicated Peter Jackson was to capturing the truth about what really went on between these two girls. He lets Pauline's diary entries do the talking and constructs the film around them. Minimizing the movie to being about lesbianism or murder does not do it justice. This movie is about a bond formed between two wounded children that grew into something so intense that it moved beyond all borders of reality. If you are one of the lucky people who understand this movie, when it ends you will feel as though you have been immersed into another world and emerged feeling disturbed, saddened, and exhilarated.This film made me a lifelong devotee of both Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, as well as Peter Jackson, and although Lord of the Rings was a masterwork, I still consider Heavenly Creatures to be Peter Jackson's masterpiece. It remains one of my all time favorite films.",Heavenly Creatures
179,elspethg17,An Untold side of New Zealand,6,10 May 2012,"Heavenly Creatures is a film that really highlights a part of New Zealand that is not often seen or talked about. It is the murders and violent crime that lies beneath the average 'Joe' community. So often in New Zealand we get films the illustrate the relationship with our land and tense Maori culture. This film along with 'Out Of The Blue' has shown a side of New Zealand that even the people the live there don't talk about. This true story is extremely deep and interesting. There is not one part in the film and history of the two girls that rings a fake and typical aspects. The reason why I gave it a six out of ten is because the people around me have ruined the ending and other parts which caused me to be bored and switch it off. So even though I knew nothing about the film it still didn't capture me, the only aspect of this film I liked is the fact that it was a New Zealand story.",Heavenly Creatures
180,MovieWatchingChick,Two Amazing Performances-A True classic,10,19 August 2006,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. While to some the mixture of the fantasy sequences might be a bit much, the overall script, cinematography, music, and performances are simply AMAZING. I guess what I find so incredible about this film is the way Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskie give such complex, layered, believable performances at such young ages. I think Kate Winslet is just an amazing actress, but her performance in Heavenly Creatures was in my opinion far superior to that of hers in Titanic. (not that I didn't think she was excellent in that a well) Melanie Lynskie is also just outstanding & while I have seen her in bit roles in films such as ""Coyote Ugly"", she is unfortunately very underused in Hollywood as she seems to bring her ""A"" game to every project she is in. If you want to see a movie that is intense, compelling, tragic and with Oscar worthy performances than do not miss this movie.",Heavenly Creatures
181,Youbetiam,Will we ever tire of the Lesbian Cliche?,1,26 March 2003,"I watched most of this movie but I was so disgusted that I kept changing the channel.  First off, I am upset that someone would capitalize on a tragedy like this.  There are plenty of real stories out there that are much more interesting and perpetuate no bigotry.  Secondly, to single out two violent lesbians and continue moviemakers' obsession with mentally ill homosexuals is just sick.  And I say this  as a woman married to a man.
The acting here is okay, with one exception; Kate Winslet couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  She has a grand total of two facial expressions; sullen and doe-eyed.  She has used nothing but these two emotions in every movie she's ever made, with the exception of Holy Smoke, where she adds closing her doe-eyes and dancing for a change of pace.  No one else really stands out as bad or good.  Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh can do good work. I don't know why they failed so miserably here.  Perhaps they should stick to fantasy movies that involve hobbits and avoid the mentally ill.",Heavenly Creatures

But afterwards I watched this movie so many times that I have fallen in love with it. Its so captivating and intense. The murder scene is so violent and not because of the blood content but because of how realistic it was. Honora Parker's scream sent shivers down my spine.  The bond between Juliet and Pauline was so intense that it left me in awe. If you listen to the narrative Pauline says that they were enacting how the Saints would have made love. They were just two passionate people with an intense friendship. What's most interesting is that the voice-over is from the real life Pauline's diary.

I found the movie kind of ""Off"" and enigmatic but i also found myself riveted to the seat with my eyes glued to the screen.

God thank the casting director for casting Kate Winslet as one of the two girls or who knows whether we'd be lucky enough to see her in all the things she has done since.  Although the story is disturbing, and particularly because it's based on an actual real life event, I felt it was wonderfully done, especially the fantasy scenes where the characters that the girls work on come to life in their minds and imaginations.  Both actresses were great and completely right for the parts, but in this movie, I give the most credit to the director.  His vision is so very clear and he passes it along to the audience with that very same clarity.A really special film.  I can truly say that I have not met a single person in my age group that doesn't think this film is one of the most special movies out there.

Well that's the stereotype over and done with now for the movie...This film has little enough charm: it's overlong, character development is replaced by screaming and girning and then there's the special effects.Now perhaps I was spoiled as I recently watched Operazione Paura and La Maschera Del Demonio but I can not understand why Peter Jackson opted for Digital Effects rather than camera trickery for this film. The effects look dated now while the sophisticated lo-fi tricks of Bava are still spellbinding and beautiful. Indeed La Maschera Del Demonio highlights another problem with this film: the woeful acting. Bava's characters all act in very formal, staged ways and Jackson tries to do something similar but his conceit falls flat on it's face through the inability of Kate Winslet to act her way out of a paper bag. Kate Winslet's acting reminds me of the old joke that an actor only has two expressions 'hat on and hat off' but in her case this is 'kooky and extra kooky.' Winslet girns, screams and shouts her way through the whole film leaving to poor viewer with a feeling similar to discovering a stone in one's shoe while on a forced march through the desert.In short a failure in almost every respect.

But I thought it was truly average, and honestly over-rated. Yes, the production values were high etc., but quality form needs salient content. Though it's apparently a true story, and was interesting (though never gripping) in places, the plot seemed derivative and the metaphorical scenes were clichéd (unicorns and adolescent girls? seriously?). Kate Winslet played herself well, as usual, though with a different accent. I feigned interest for my partner's sake, who did rate it highly, though she seemed puzzled and possibly annoyed when the movie ended and I said 'let's watch Night of the Living Dead again, and continue the dead actors theme'.

The acting was above excellent, the portrayals of two teenage girls locked into the spiral of obsession,fantasy and psychosis was breathtaking.Even more chilling is the realisation that this is not the figment of an overactive imagination, but a true life account of an event that shocked the world.The casting of Melanie Linskey and Kate Winslet in the two lead roles was a stroke of genius and the skillful way in which two such young actresses handled such intense,emotive and demanding roles was fantastic to watch.All in all this is film that leaves a lasting scar.

It's portrayal of the true crime story is dead on, and it was Kate Winslet's best performance, in my opinion, definitely a perfect vehicle to create a star.  Melanie Lynskey is the underrated star in this, what with Kate's Titanic fame, but it takes true talent to play the role she did, and this movie would not have been the excellence it is without Melanie or Kate.

It attempts to make the lives of these two troubled girls come alive, and it succeeds -- through practically everything cinema can offer: wonderful screenplay and dialogue, great use of sound and music, 3-d animation, precise and moving acting, and more.Some have said it's a violent film, but there is only one scene of true violence -- at the very end.  The rest of the movie attempts to get us to inhabit the world that lead to that act.  It manages to be moving and beautiful along the way ... until we are faced with the horrific consequences.I've never read The Hobbitt or other Tolkien books (and have an aversion to that fantasy stuff), but the fact that Peter Jackson, who made this movie, is making the Lord of the Rings series makes me think they may actually be worth watching.

Perhaps because I discovered it for myself when it was first released, and saw it without any preconceived baggage. I love this film unconditionally, for it's invention, it's imagination and a million other reasons. Kate Winslet's best performance(she is magnificent, but Melanie Lynskey is astonishing; the whole film hangs on the credibility of her portrayal of Pauline), Jackson's depiction of the Fourth World, the knowledge that you're rooting for people who are going to do something unspeakably awful, and of course the joyous abandon of the ""Donkey Serenade"" sequence. Jackson's masterstroke is his depiction of the moments leading up to the murder, soundtracked by ""The Humming Chorus"" - the fact that you know what is about to happen makes the suspense all the more excruciating, as your stomach tightens and you still can't quite believe they'll do it. What follows is genuinely horrifying, even on repeated viewing.

I understand that a film such as this can be too intense for some viewers, but this does not effect its quality or significance.  Peter Jackson uses his horror film background to erect a dramatically twisted tragedy that barely misses being perfect.  For the audience the experience is like putting on a pathological suit, where you walk in the footsteps of near crazy and then jump over to the other side.  Remarkably though, Jackson, manages to maintain a balance where the viewer does not lose sympathy for any characters, therefore making the tragic turn much more devastating.

The first scene with the girls running screaming soaked in blood set a strange tone for the movie. I thought of it throughout and didn't know whether it was an embellishment on one of their fantasies or that something horrible was going to happen to them. Obviously I didn't know that the film was based on a true story despite the mention of the excerpts from Paulines diary at the beginning.The portrayal of the two girls and their relationship both with each other and with their parents and others in the lives was sympathetic of what many teenage girls go through, however not quite to the extent of these two. It made me feel a strong connection with the girls and their loving friendship with one another. I liked the way the homosexual theme was played down during the film, not using it so much as an excuse for the actions, instead playing more on their self obsession and hysterical nearsightedness. They are immature and seemingly unaware of much of the reality around them, it is unfortunate for them to have lived in a time of archaic mental health care when issues such as theirs were frowned upon and misunderstood.The cinematography throughout was beautiful, i found the expressions of Paulines face to have the heaviest effect on me. Also the use of the fantastical claymation scenes was done to great effect, however, I found that the girls were each called by three different names at times to be confusing. The names and definition of the clay figures was also confusing at times due to their looking so similar. However, it was a great connection to show what was going on in the minds of the girls. Particularly the scenes with the pink gem they used in the end to distract Honora before the fatal attack.All in all this film was a clear insight into the misunderstood mind of a teenager.",Heavenly Creatures

203,sigismond,A cinematic injustice....,10,18 June 2005,"A decade has come and gone since 'Heavenly Creatures' first graced cinema screens. It brought its director, Peter Jackson, and the second leading lady of the film, Kate Winslet, immediate international recognition. Unfortunately, the main leading lady, and indeed the real star of the movie, Melanie Lynskey was a victim of the film's global popularity. She received no publicity of any kind, particularly here in Britain, and remained every bit of the unknown she had been, prior to being discovered. To this day, Lynskey remains unknown in the United Kingdom. She, along with Kate Winslet, brought a hell of a lot of talent to bear when she became her character, but she was treated so shabbily by the people who could have elevated her career, as they had done with Kate Winslet. Her portrayal of Pauline Parker was the most visible sign of her talent. The scenes of friendship, love, passion and their shared hysteria as they commit the murder of Pauline's mother were a testament to Frances Walsh's belief in Lynskey's acting ability. She should have been rewarded with the kind of international success that Kate received. She got nothing, but three years of career-destroying obscurity. Yet, like her friend Drew Barrymore, she came back. Unlike Drew, Lynskey is still flying too low under Hollywood's radar. US and UK celebrity-based magazines have to start noticing and acknowledging her presence on the movie scene.",Heavenly Creatures
204,glimmer,"Interesting and disturbing, yet refreshing",8,28 March 1999,"I can't really say I've seen anything quite like this.  It contained images of fantasy both wonderful and terrible.  Everything you see through the two girl's eyes seems in many ways to be a different world; their fantasy is messed with reality to such an extent that it seems their world truly is the way they picture it.  The bond between them seems incomprehensible in many ways, based on friendship, sexuality, and shared knowledge of a world that only they can appreciate.  I wonder what forces of the time they lived in caused events in their lives to take the paths they did.  Compared  to many films I have seen recently this one contains far more life and emotion. In many area's the way the movie was filmed seemed to perfectly complement its contents.  Many scenes seemed to be likened to a hazy memory of long ago. I feel this effect greatly contributed to the impact at the end.  Despite its disturbing nature I really liked the film and recommend it to anyone who would like to try something different from today's mainstream movies.",Heavenly Creatures
205,holly_j,How friendship and love can be so intensely mix that they made you do anything...even very bad things...,9,8 May 1999,"Another side of Kate Winslet that many discovered in Titanic. Based on a true story, this intense blend of love and friendship portray the loyalty and the unique bound between Pauline and Juliet, two teenage girls who try to escape the constricting presence of adults by transposing themselves in an imaginary kingdom. Their only desire is to be together and when this simple wish is threatened they decide that nothing and especially no one should prevent them to be friends...not even Pauline's mother. A visit to another kind of passion crime.",Heavenly Creatures
206,spiff22,"This is an incredible film, one of my all time favorites.",10,2 December 1999,"One of the best there is, shows Jackson's versatility, that he can do more than just whacked out, gory (but entertaining) films. Kate Winslet's real gem (not Titanic).  Fantastic and odd humor, drama and creativity. A must see.",Heavenly Creatures
207,rhysf-01947,Extraordinary,9,22 April 2020,Peter Jackson was in top form with this film. Such an astonishing piece of work - makes me wish he would go back to making these sorts of intriguing and challenging films.,Heavenly Creatures
208,bongour037,Argh...,4,18 January 2008,"Sweet Jesus did this film bore me. Actually, that is probably not the right term. It aggravated me. So much. I don't know how I mustered up the strength to finish watching it. The film gets better towards the ending though, so if you're brave enough to suffer through the first half, you'll be rewarded by a good murder scene at the end. The acting? I liked the two fathers (and their wives, a little less). The two girls made me mad a lot of the time. I found myself yelling at the screen and slapping my hands to my forehead too often. This happened especially when they would scream (which is endless in this movie) and cry, or make hurt faces. The only reason I gave this a four is because I enjoyed some of Jackson's shots. I should have filmed myself watching the movie, as my comments and facial expressions probably would have been much, much more entertaining. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly if you're in the mood to bitch to a screen for an hour and a half.",Heavenly Creatures
209,myfamousmistake,All good things must come to an end,1,23 January 2002,"I can hardly believe this was from the same person who brought us such genius films as bad taste, meet the feebles, and braindead.  Possibly the biggest let down in history.  One should  only see this movie if they like a lot of talking and standing around.  Incredibly droll.",Heavenly Creatures
210,jboardman,Heavenly? I think not.,4,23 July 2002,"I fail to understand why this movie was so highly rated.     It's a chick flick and a poor one to boot.  The character development was interesting, at first.  After the first 1/2 hour my husband fell asleep. I kept on watching hoping the story to pick up and make a point. Neither once  happened.  Judge for yourself or better yet, skip this one all together.",Heavenly Creatures
211,Ariane-Rosselet,An absolute masterpiece of art and deep intelligence.,10,1 December 2002,"The day I've seen this magic and haunting movie, I knew it would be the movie of my life, my absolute favorite. I'm very happy to get this occasion to explain why (a little, because it need more than just few phrases for it !), with the hope that other people will see it... and will love it !  HC is an absolute masterpiece of art and deep intelligence, acted by two amazing actresses with such an incredible intensity. The script of Walsh and Jackson is a pure marvel: if you know the real ""Parker-Hulme murder case"", it's obvious that nobody could make better, because they choice to make a psychological portrait instead of a sensational criminal story. Jackson said that HC is a ""murder story about love, a murder story without villains"": I totally agree. Even you can't excuse the murder, you can understand the two friends and their own special logic - in their own irrational world. For Pauline and Juliet, nothing is important but their incredible, deeply and strongly devoted friendship and try to separate them is just unthinkable... and dangerous ! This marvelous movie is so intensive that it makes you feel every feelings: beauty and horror, humor and violence, love and hate, happiness and despair... thankful to Kate and Mel who ARE really their characters. This very special relationship is fascinating: two adolescent girls so physically and socially opposite, but in fact each one has her own affective problems, a great imagination and a real love for arts, are reunited at first for the best and finally for the worst... Their mutual attachment is far beyond a simple friendship or even love: it's like an emotional and spiritual bond and these two are just one person. There were a lot of questions and points of view about the famous ""Night with the Saints""'s scene: for me, even it's seems to be a love scene - in an effective physical way - it's such a delicate one, and only the literal expression of their fantasies and their special mutual devotion, without any sexual stuff. GO rent or buy this masterpiece and you'll never forget it ! It's an infinite subject of thoughts and intense feelings. For all HC-fans, there is only one formula for conclusion: ""Wonderful ! Heavenly ! Beautiful ! And ours !"" When you'll see it, you'll understand... Enjoy it for ever !",Heavenly Creatures
212,SlimPickins,...warm feelings inside...,10,3 April 2003,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time. Peter Jackson is my favorite director of all time. Every movie he has made is a masterpiece. Perhaps I seem a bit over-zealous, perhaps not. The acting in this movie was great, and not just from the main characters. The supporting cast was great as well.However, as great as this movie is, the plot of the movie seems to disturb normal people. Most casual movie viewers dismiss this piece as a lesbian movie and nothing more. I don't consider it a lesbian movie at all.All in all, this is a cinematic masterpiece in all respects. I only wish that Melanie Lynskey was in more movies.",Heavenly Creatures
213,minx_nz,Close To Home,9,24 January 2005,"Heavenly Creatures, for me, is close to home and to be honest I was not really aware it had happened until I watched the film and have since watched the film around five or six times, as well as reading as much as I could about the film and the real event. I did not really appreciate the film either until last year (2004). The film highlights the themes and emotions incredibly well and is totally an enjoyable viewing experience. Peter Jackson's input into the film was a huge credit to him and his techniques with lighting and sound were incredible. Symbolism strengthens these devices as well and visually Heavenly Creatures is a truly wonderful film, ironic to its hidden wickedness.",Heavenly Creatures
214,calamityjane986,Watched this what I was just about eight years old,4,17 October 2020,"It was bizarre to watch when I was child, honestly the clay people kind of scared me. I thought it was going to be a sweet lesbian story of love and it turned out to be not that..... The mom in the end reminded me of my own mom I cried a lot
Don't let your little kids watch this
Speaking from experience. I really should try it now that I'm older maybe it'll be different..",Heavenly Creatures
215,tomasenespana,A frighteningly true story of twisted friendship,8,23 March 2005,"This probably has spoilers--so watch out!Peter Jackson is now best known for his ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, but this movie, I believe, helped establish him as the right director for that gigantic undertaking. It is creepy--maybe because we know that this story really happened--and as we watch the changes in Pauline and Juliet over the course of the movie, the girls become more and more frightening. Another distinctly eerie aspect of Jackson's film is the entries taken straight out of Pauline's diary. At first mundane and typical of a teenage girl, eventually the diary reflects just how monstrous the girls had become--quotes like, ""it was a perfect day to kill Mother,"" and, ""It seemed like she knew what was coming, and wanted it,"" are so sociopathic it is impossible to see the little girl in either child again.I watched the movie as part of my Philosophy Goes to the Movies class, and the comments afterward focused on the friendship between the two girls. We asked, ""What went wrong?"" Obviously something did in their relationship--somewhere along the way, a line was crossed by the two. Jackson does a fine job of immersing the viewer so much in the normal suburban lives of the children that the viewer can't exactly pinpoint when the relationship went murderous. I know many young girls who had the same sort of relationship during their teenage years, but none of them became murderers. Jackson never comes and and blatantly tells the viewer what it is that forces the girls to kill, he leaves that open to interpretation--maybe it's the anti-homosexual constraining society, maybe it's the sociopathic nature of the little world they created only for the two of them, who knows? Many young children create imaginary worlds, and large amounts of adolescents have homosexual tendencies during puberty--yet not all turn out to be killers. It is a tribute to Jackson to not take a stand on exactly what caused the girls to turn to matricide--many other filmmakers would force their opinion on the audience--Jackson lets our own psyches try to comprehend the girls' motivations.""Heavenly Creatures"" is a disturbing movie--I recommend it to anyone who has only seen Jackson's Ring Trilogy, or who enjoys odd human dramas. It is sure to make you shiver--especially when you learn that Juliet is an established author writing none other than murder mysteries in England. For another good scare read her biography, and pay special attention to what she learned as a teenager.",Heavenly Creatures
216,oakscl,"A trip down the rabbit hole, but neither of the girls are Alice.",7,7 April 2005,"Is Heavenly Creatures a movie about two people finding love despite all circumstances, or is it an attempt to show how suppression and intolerance could have severely drastic results? In either case, two young girls find each other, becoming the best of friends  until their families start to suspect more is going on, and so try to break the two apart.The opening scene is of the two girls running through what appears to be a wooded area, covered in blood, showing the climax of the film immediately. The two girls, Juliet and Pauline, meet and quickly find that many of their interests are shared. Soon after, they start to create a 'fantasy world' where they escape into a realm of make-believe.They escape further and further into this world, even taking upon the personas of many of the characters they have created, almost intertwining the two, making their relationship  for this has developed into more than a friendship  seem more than a little inappropriate to the parents.For a movie based on reality  the diary of Pauline Rieper as the main source - Jackson does amazingly well with the material. The acting is superb until near the climax, where Kate Winslet continues to shine, but Melanie Lynskey's work gets a tad over the top. In fact, Sarah Pierse's acting as the mother of Pauline also seems to be a bit disconnected at the end. For her credit, it could be interpreted as being unable to see the two girls' motivations, but it seemed rather much.The scenes in the 'fantasy realm' are all over the top as well  but they were meant to be, and so adds to the girls' surrealistic departure from reality. Here Jackson's fascination with special effects is obvious, clay men and women wandering around the fictional 'castle' area.All in all, the movie is a surreal vision of two girls who would not let their parents get between them. Worth a viewing, if you can handle the situational aspects of the film.",Heavenly Creatures
217,queennysrin,Judging Anne Perry,10,24 September 2005,"An amazing movie about the intense and misunderstood bond of two girls, Pauline and Juliet,outcasts, who create their own fantasy world whenever things go wrong. Their bond is so strong, that when separated, they become physically ill. It is the saddest movie i have ever watched and ironically, their biggest fear becomes a reality: They murder the mother because they want to get rid of whoever it is that separates them, and their punishment is exactly that: separation from each other. I have read some of your comments about banning Anne Perry and I think that that's really stupid. The best artists and writers create out of pain and one must not judge her talents due to a bad decision that she had made when she was in a fragile state of mind. The point of the movie was to convey this relationship, this bond that was misunderstood by the girls' family and what such a misunderstanding and in acceptance of such love could lead to. You are doing just that, judging without understanding, knowing and feeling their pain. Besides, the girls got the worst punishment imaginable to them - they were separated...",Heavenly Creatures
218,zaniahva,Ode to Peter Jackson,10,17 December 2005,"So many only know him for his newer work (Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong) and have yet to appreciate the genius he is. Heavenly Creatures may not be his best work or most critically acclaimed...but it is brilliant and masterful. It demonstrates his creativity, willingness to break the mold and passion for making a movie what it should be...entertaining. Even matricide. Kate Winslet is brilliant in her role and so is Melanie Lynskey. It almost makes you pity the real life people they were portraying. I don't know if Jackson was trying to make you have a heart for what these girls did or if he just wanted to share the story from their perspective, but it would not have made sense from any other view than the girls. The journals they kept explained their insanity and makes you wonder why they didn't get more time. Only in America, I guess. This is a wonderful piece of work. My favorite of all of Jackson's movies.",Heavenly Creatures
