0,SnoopyStyle,Hathaway the bright spot,6,12 June 2015,"Allison Lang (Anne Hathaway) is from the upper class white neighborhood of Pacific Palisades. Her parents (Michael Biehn, Laura San Giacomo) are divorced and she's not connecting with them. Her boyfriend Toby is a Wigger and a poser. He takes her and her friend Emily (Bijou Phillips) to the bad side of L.A. They try to buy drugs and get rolled by Hector (Freddy Rodríguez). Even with Toby's cowardice, she is excited by the incident and returns to the spot the next night with Emily, Amanda (Shiri Appleby) and Sasha (Alexis Dziena). She finds Hector again as she falls further and further into his dangerous world.This is a souped-up afterschool special. I don't particularly find these characters that compelling. The girls could do whatever the hell they want for all I care. It starts with the idiotic posing from Toby. It brings up an interesting casting choice. It's crazy looking back that Mike Vogel got the bigger role while Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Channing Tatum are cast as his friends. The other problematic casting choice is Freddy Rodríguez. I can't buy him as a gang leader especially since he's a foot shorter than Anne Hathaway. He's definitely not hard enough and there's a bit of Napoleon going on here. Hathaway is good in this movie and keeps it compelling. She's really the major bright spot in this.",Havoc
1,claudio_carvalho,The Interception of Two Worlds,7,15 April 2007,"In Los Angeles, Allison Lang (Anne Hathaway) is a bored girl from an upper class dysfunctional family that acts and dresses like a slut. Her wealthy boyfriend and friends are totally influenced by the hip-hop culture, behaving like rappers, dressing and imitating their lifestyle. When they decide to drive to East L.A. for fun, they meet a Latin gang of drug-dealers and Allison and her best friend Emily (Bijou Phillips) become fascinated with their ""gangsta"" lifestyle. Later they return to the ghetto to visit and excite Hector (Freddy Rodríguez) and his friends, expecting to join their 16th Street gang. When the guys propose them to have sex as a form of initiation, they change their mind, leading to a tragic consequence.""Havoc"" raises a great theme, the existence of two different worlds in most of the big cities, and the consequences of the interception of these different worlds. Unfortunately, director Barbara Kopple seems to be afraid to disclose the real world and in the capital scenes she spoils the movie. The gang-bang with Emily is interrupted as if the drugged gangsters were gentlemen, respecting her request. Allison is not raped in the same moment, what would be inconceivable with the guys excited by the girls after drinking lots of booze and smoke joint. Further, the movie is suddenly interrupted, as if the budget had ended before its conclusion. If this film had been shot by an experienced director like Michael Haneke, I believe it would be a great film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Garotas Sem Rumo"" (""Adrift Girls"")",Havoc
2,lee_eisenberg,you can't go as far as you think,7,20 January 2011,"OK, so the rich-girls-try-to-associate-with-ghetto-people plot line has gotten used in movies before. But some unpleasant stuff happens this time. Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips play Pacific Palisades teenagers Allison and Emily, who are both fascinated by the Latino gangstas in LA. So, they decide to start associating with these Latino gangstas. I mean, it's not as if they'll get in over their heads, right? Understand in advance that ""Havoc"" isn't ""Mean Streets"" or ""Boyz N the Hood"". It's just its own movie (well, maybe a little bit of ""Rebel without a Cause"" in there). This isn't any kind of masterpiece. I certainly felt a sense of deja vu while watching at least some of the scenes. But even so, director Barbara Kopple - previously a documentary maker - has created a good look at the always tense situation in Southern California. All the cast members do a very good job with their roles, even if the movie isn't the greatest. It's worth seeing maybe once (and not just because of a few specific scenes of Anne Hathaway!). Also starring Shiri Appleby, Freddy Rodriguez (Rico on ""Six Feet Under""), Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Biehn and Laura San Giacomo.",Havoc
3,rmax304823,Nostalgie de la Boue,6,22 July 2006,"Havoc (2005) The Shadow of Sixteen Candles., 16 June 2006*** This comment may contain spoilers ***A lot of people seem not to have enjoyed this film very much. I'm not sure why. Yes, the rich girls seemed phony but lots of teenage girls sound similar in their speech. It comes across as so stylized as to be stilted, yet it's a genuine parole. It's the way some people speak in real life.The acting wasn't that bad either. The only major flaw in the story is that Ann Hathaway didn't take her clothes off more often. Just kidding. I've never seen her in any of the Disney epics so was deprived of the enjoyment of having any pedophilic fantasies fulfilled. She's the best looking of the bunch, in a conventional way, and she handles the part like a pro.The story, alas, is the weakest part of the film. It isn't just that the rich kids are stereotypically bored. I imagine boredom among the very rich can be a serious problem. When you have everything material that you need, it's hard to glom onto a goal other than momentary pleasure. And it isn't just that the Latinos we see are a horde of overmuscled greaseballs who feel only contempt for the ""white girls"" and who sell dope and whose bodies are adorned with elaborate tattoos.It's that the dialog doesn't always ring true. Some Pachuco punk who has gang banged her and her friend comes up with something like, ""Who are you? You not real. Not REALLY real. You a fake."" And so on. The guy sounds like he's studied with Fritz Perls.And yet the movie is an attempt to answer an interesting question and perhaps only a happily middle-class female director could have handled it this well. The question is: What is it about lower-class men that attracts upper-class women? In my experience black men have far more of this mojo than Latinos, but okay. The attraction extends to gangstas in prison, even those who will never be released. Are such men perceived by such women as imbued with some feral sexual power? Are women driven to them by impulses like those that put men behind the wheels of racing cars? Is it self-testing? Is there an adrenalin rush involved in seeing if a rogue male can be brought under rein, like a wild stallion? I don't know. I'm just asking. I'm not aware of any professional research on the subject but it's a fascinating one.",Havoc
4,wes-connors,Let Slip the Dawgs of War,4,26 July 2009,"Teenager Anne Hathaway (as Allison) is bored going down on phony boyfriend Mike Vogel (as Toby). When she and her rappin' high school friends kick a trip to East Los Angeles, Ms. Hathaway finds herself attracted to real life gangsta Freddy Rodriguez (as Hector), who makes Mr. Vogel pee his pants. Soon, Hathaway and likewise bored ""gal pal"" Bijou Phillips (as Emily Rubin) are up for smacking the hook with da cholos. Then, things get out of hand Huh? Wassup with the ending? Apparently, we're supposed to guess. Anyway, this was an unconvincing story. They start off with a cast of performers too far removed from both sweet sixteen and Compton. Don't feel too much like a pedophile while you enjoy the topless pair of leading women. They're of age. The phony wigger gangsta jive is laughable. Totally. The story becomes moderately interesting when Ms. Phillips makes her accusation, then drops off.**** Havoc (6/26/05) Barbara Kopple ~ Anne Hathaway, Bijou Phillips, Freddy Rodriguez, Mike Vogel",Havoc
5,jotix100,Chaos,6,1 August 2011,"A group of bored teenagers coming from rich families in Los Angeles discover the style most black inner city kids practice. Some of them, especially the young men, even go as far as sporting the clothing worn by the people they are imitating. Two girls, Allison and Emily, on the other hand, are more daring without a need for adopting the fashions when the hang out. Sam and Eric, who are the leaders of the school gang, decide to explore East Los Angeles, a neighborhood in which the Hispanics are a majority. The teenagers, accompanied by Allison and Emily, decide to buy drugs from a street gang called '16'. The meeting ends up badly, as the Mexicans cheat the suburban kids. Allison, who earlier has spoken about how bored she really is, finds the excitement she yearns to have in her sheltered life.All these aimless youths have one thing in common, they come from dysfunctional families with money, where a parent figure is always absent. Allison invites more trouble when she decides to explore that world, totally dominated by Hector. Allison, having sold the idea of joining the gang to Emily, decide to go to Hector's turf. The thrill of entering that territory will end badly, as Emily, the weakest of the duo, suffers a shock of her life. In the end, there will be a confrontation heard, but not seen that serves as a sobering reminder the two worlds could not blend easily.Barbara Kopple, the award winning documentary director, tried her hand with this film that juxtaposes two cultures that are as far as night and day. The rich life in Pacific Palisades will never accept the less privileged people of East Los Angeles. The film is a sort of parable in how the bored teens of the richer suburbs want to experience the real world they only love to imitate. Ms. Kopple uses a device she is quite familiar with, the young man that is seen interviewing his peers in search of answers which are never too clear.Anne Hathaway surprises with her daring performance. Usually seen in good girl roles, her Allison is quite a departure for her. She showed courage in accepting a role that was totally the opposite of what we knew of her screen persona. Freddy Rodriguez is also good as Hector, the boy that prefers to stay within his own territory. Bijou Phillips plays Emily. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matt O'Leary do a good job of imitating the black kids they would like to impersonate. Laura San Giacomo and Michael Biehn are seen briefly as Allison's parents.",Havoc
6,gridoon2021,Like a punch to the gut,6,26 June 2017,"A slice-of-life about privileged, bored, hedonistic white kids who want a taste of street/gang life but get more than they bargained for is clichéd movie material by now, and ""Havoc"" is too short to develop the theme with much depth, but it has a harsh immediacy that probably comes from director Barbara Kopple's documentary background, and you can't take your eyes off it for a second. Anne Hathaway lets it all out (literally) in her breakthrough adult performance, and she is incredibly sexy. **1/2 out of 4.",Havoc
7,morrison-dylan-fan,Traffic Havoc,5,1 February 2006,"After seeing the movie,i have to say it feels like a lighter version of one of the story lines in the movie Traffic. The plot: A bunch of wealthy high-school kids,that include Allison(Hathaway) and her best friend Emily(Bijou Phillps)who are trying to act as if they are in a Hip-Hop culture.One night,when the kids go out to get some drugs,they meet some ""real"" people from a Hip-Hop culture.Everyone else is scared,but Allison really likes seeing what they do,so the next night she comes back and goes to a great party with them.She goes back and tells her friend Emily how great it was,so they both go to a party that night.While at the party they say they want to join the gang,the gang tell them they have to do an ""initiation"".Which is that they have to have sex with all the gang members.Allisons not keen at all and leaves,but Emily stays there.And has sex with all of them.But gets scared when things start getting out of hand.After the party Emily lies and says that she did not have sex but was raped. View on the film: The Screenplay. I have to say i am a bit shocked,that the screenplay had been on New Lines shelf for seven years!(i have seen a lot worst movies then this).Written by Jessica Kaplan (who sadly died 3 weeks before filming started,in a plane crash at age 24.)and Stephen""Traffic""Gaghan.There is a strong feeling in the script that,Gaghan took the Erika Christensen/Michael Douglas story line from Traffic,and put it in this.One of the things that makes this movie a bit different then other teen movies.Is using one of the issues from Sam Peckinpahs Straw Dogs.Which questioned if the main female character (who was getting raped),gets into it and stars to have sex with him.does it count as rape?.Which i think makes the film more interesting.The part where the kids act ""hip"" gets a bit boring,and there are some holes (i really want to go out with someone who has a 98% Chance of them blowing my brains out!).The Cinematography is good,but parts of it look to much like Traffic(the extrema use of the colourer blue and yellow.) The acting: While everyone else does well,Hathaway is a clear stand out,who does a good job at trying to keep her friend safe.Final view on the film: If any one wants to see a bit of a different teen movie,and want to see more of Hathaway .You will like this.",Havoc
8,gradyharp,Havoc it is,2,5 December 2005,"If there is some justice to misjudging investments in movies, then the fact that this film went directly to DVD despite the presence of a crew that includes some impressive names is notable. Writer Stephen Gaghan ('Traffic', 'Rules of Engagement', 'Syriana', etc) has composed a contrived script about rich, bored, Hip Hop imitating, unmotivated teenagers trying to spice up their insignificant lives by treading into the East LA 'danger zone', an experience from which they learn nothing about cross cultural ethnic groups and just return to Pacific Palisades whining about 'damaged goods'. It is an insulting story, one that stereotypes Hispanics as drug-peddling, raping thugs in a totally black and white manner, not taking into consideration the viewpoint of a cultural group's positive attributes and philosophies.No longer a viable gimmick, the film begins with the tired cliché of a kid making a documentary about his friends, asking what they like and don't like, their goals, their outlooks. The fact that none of the interviewees has a clue about life, preferring to follow the current Hip Hop language (very poorly written) and focusing on sex, drugs, and escapes from their wealthy environments. Among these are three girls, the main character being Allison (Anne Hathaway, miscast in every way), who follow their superficial boyfriends on a joyride for drugs into East LA. There they meet Hector (Freddy Rodríguez, trying his best to create a character without the benefit of a decent script) who sells them drugs and whom Allison eyes. Allison is so shallow she doesn't have a clue about her motivations, just wanting something 'dangerous' to happen. She coaxes her equally clueless girlfriends into going into East LA to seduce Hector and ends up in a ridiculous barter for joining Hector's gang (no mention is made at all about the Chicanas who would never allow these three geeks to enter their territory unchallenged). The results of a barter results in an experience with which the girls cannot cope so they run back to the protection of the dysfunctional parents they loathe to cover the mess of their caper. Attempts to resolve this dumb story fail pathetically.With so many fine Indie films that go begging for attention, it is a shame money is wasted on this sort of meaningless mess of a film. The 'unrated' designation is probably meant for the occasional nudity and gratuitous sex and language, but here 'Unrated' might just mean that the film is so without merit that it is non-classifiable. Avoid this one and don't think that a fine writer such as Gaghan guarantees a successful story. Grady Harp",Havoc
9,zetes,"Better than it's given credit for being, though certainly far from great",7,29 December 2008,"This movie was thrown out on DVD in 2005 without any real theatrical release. It's well pedigreed for such treatment, directed by famed documentarian Barbara Kopple (Harlan County USA), written by late phenom Jessica Kaplan, ""fixed"" by famed screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (Traffic) and starring Anne Hathaway in her first serious role. The film is far from perfect, but it isn't nearly as bad as people have said. It's main problem is that it is undoubtedly exploitative. Hathaway and co-star Bijou Philips both get naked, the kind of naked that leaves the viewer feeling sleazy. The film is about a group of teenagers from upscale Los Angeles who like to play gangsta, pretending they're black or Latino. When Hathaway's boyfriend is threatened by a Latino drug dealer (Freddy Rodriguez of Planet Terror), she is attracted to the more authentic gangsta scene. She becomes involved with Rodriguez, which leads to the titular havoc. While many of the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, Hathaway's is well written, and she turns in the best performance of her career up to that point. She's nearly as intriguing here as she would later be in Rachel Getting Married. Also appearing is my favorite young actor of today, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but he has a pretty weak role, so it's not worth watching just for him.",Havoc
10,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Havoc,6,26 June 2006,"I could start off this review in Singlish by saying ""This movie damn havoc"", and it just about sums it up accurately and nicely. Sex, drugs and gangsterism from the hop is hip culture, this movie attempts to provide a social commentary about the lives of super rich teenagers in the Palasades, wasting their bored lives away by trying to emulate another culture they think is cool, the wannabes who chose not to conform to the norms, but try their darndest best to be one in the 'hood.Anne Hathaway assumes the lead role as Allison Lang, a wide-eyed teenager whose language is as beautiful as her appearance. Having her material needs satisfied by her ultra rich parents, but living in essentially an empty home, her friends and her seek out the alternative lifestyle which promises loads of fun and excitement - drugs, drink and fights. Being associated with a gang brings about some perceived self esteem and self worth. But where do you draw the line when you're always seeking another high moment? A journey to ""downtown"" - the areas of the have-nots, where seedy bogeymen reside in, areas where parents warn their children to stay away from, sparks a discovery of a wonderland for Allison and her best friend Emily (Bijou Phillips), as they make repeated trips to be amongst the real boys in the 'hood, to hang out, chill, and do whatever them wannabes have done at a magnitude of 10. It's a primal attraction and sexual tension between the girls and the men (not the boys they hang out with, who pee in their pants when faced with real danger - acting cool is not cool), and between Allison and Hector (Freddy Rodriguez).But like all revelations, sometimes it takes the hard way to learn a lesson, and the movie picked up on this rather rapidly in the last third, once they got enticed into playing a game of dice (with sexual connotations) in order to be initiated into Hector's gang. Basically, the audience observes the attraction of an alternative lifestyle, of wannabes thinking they can handle it all, and of redemption and change.While it was a surprise to see Michael Biehn in the movie, the movie clearly belonged to Anne Hathaway in her very first attempt to break away from her goody-two-shoes roles like in the Princess Diaries and Ella Enchanted. However, with the M18 rating here, this movie suffered cuts where it really mattered, and a poor edit too at one of the more pivotal scenes which literally screwed up the understanding of what actually happened, only to be told at face value, suggesting the ""truth"" of the matter, at a later stage. Sometimes I wonder why not release it as R21, and keep the film intact. Surely Hathaway has fans, but to mutilate the movie to let them in, is a bad decision.It's peculiar to have the movie released this week, up against Singer's SUperman. Maybe some rebellious bored teenagers happen to be the answer to balance the truth and justice that the last son of Krypton embodies?",Havoc
11,christopher-underwood,I wondered if I would ever watch it,9,17 September 2009,"I bought this on DVD very cheaply, almost exclusively because I thought the title was great. Checking the film out on IMDb upon my return home and I wondered if I would ever watch it. So many reviewers tell of the irritating way the male rich kids are always aping the gangster classes and the girls talking in that affected cluck-cluck way. The fact hip-hop does little for me looked like I was set for some fast forwarding. How wrong I was. This is one heck of a good movie. OK, I don't suppose every little rich boy is quite as silly as those depicted and same goes for the girls, BUT there is more than an element of truth here. Even as an oldie living in the UK, I am aware of kids speaking and acting like this, so I'm pretty certain it happens in the US. We must have copied from somewhere! I'm also sure that East LA could never look as potentially glamorous as this BUT, this was written by a young girl of 16 and at the very least this is fantasy. And why would this fantasy persist? Why might poor little rich girls want to risk all for a potentially exciting bout of carnal pleasure? Why indeed BUT, surely we have seen this theme explored a thousand times and always we exclaim that a woman could not be so foolish, that she would surely stay with her own kind. Oh yeah? Anyway it happens and it is depicted here with great candour and skill. A very grubby and absorbing morality tale of what happens when a couple of nubile white chicks stumble into an episode of 'The Wire'.",Havoc
12,Robert_duder,Could have been interesting but casting took it all away,6,22 January 2006,"Havoc was basically nothing but a vehicle for former Disney Princess Anne Hathaway to try and break out of her squeaky clean image and I imagine it worked for that end. The idea and story behind Havoc is a good one...in this day and age where minority gang culture very much influences youth in every type of city and town it would have been interesting to watch a more documentary style film about that. Director Barbara Kopple has done numerous documentaries and probably would have done well to stick to the same. Instead she cast white kids who are the most improbable ""wiggers"" you could possibly imagine and try to make it interesting to watch them get involved in the East Latino gang culture.Anne Hathaway is not bad in the film, it's a huge stretch for her as an actress so she must be given kudos for trying. Sometimes you have to realize your limits and she would have to change her appearance and really sink herself into this role to make it believable and she doesn't do that. She only does the surface work so it's an average performance. The supposedly multi talented Bijou Phillips is just more eye candy for the film although her role probably has the most depth playing Emily who accuses gang leader Hector of rape which isn't entirely the case. Her story actually opens up some interesting social debate as to whether her situation was rape or her own fault. Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a very small role (thank Goodness) is ridiculous. He's not playing it seriously or even trying and his presence is an insult to what the movie tries to do. Freddy Rodríguez as the East Latin gang leader Hector does a decent job and looks the part but with the rather weak script and other actors it doesn't matter much. Mike Vogel as Hathaway's boyfriend Toby is mostly a joke too but perhaps does represent what rich white kids try to accomplish by being ""gangsta."" There isn't much of a story, it's just basically about Hathaway's character wanting to get involved with this gang and they try to establish her crappy home life but it's such an empty and vapid film. Fortunately Hathaway is watchable enough to make the film at least slightly worthwhile.I'm still disappointed by Kopple's attempt to make a film that could have been very interesting. If nothing else she only managed to make a controversial film because a former Disney star gets naked and I'm not sure that's much of a claim to fame. However people will watch it for that reason alone and although I'm giving this a ""reasonable"" review for more you can skip this dud. It is watchable and interesting at times but for the most part just a big disappointment. 6/10",Havoc
13,Rodrigo_Amaro,Doesn't match with it has to say and show.,6,5 July 2012,"There's a quote in Godard's ""Le Petit Soldat"" that perfectly reflects something that's hidden in most of us and we don't how to express it, something that seems to upset us in a devastating way. The main character says this while looking his reflection in the mirror: ""It's strange. When I look myself in the face I get the feeling I don't match with what I think it's inside"". Such statement, such insatisfaction is part of some of us in one point or another in life because world is made of appearances which cause endless worries on people who need to work harder than others to reach the ""required"" state of society thinks is the adequate. That character suffered enough, knows what's he talking about and he knows he can change this fact. ""Havoc"" could be defined into that one quote but it goes more than that. Here, white girls (some boys too) from great upbringings, with money and clothes all around, lifestyle desired by many but who want to be part of more exciting things, sing rap and be part of less fortuned cliques, be with them and be like them. Why? Because we're bored, we want to feel what's being dangerous is like, we wanna escape the uselessness of our lives. But only if could use those words, then we would probably feel some sympathy for them. They say they're bored, that when they're among their peers they feel like a dream but being with drug dealers and criminals is the real thing, something to feel better but all those explanations aren't good enough, it should have more. At the end of the day, they go back home to their ""miserable"" lives and still gonna wake up being white girls trying to impress others with their behavior, language coming from another culture. Anne Hatahway wonderfully illustrates youth's identity crisis in a scene where she goes from being the usual image of herself, trying to sell an idea, to later be a completely smart girl with fascinating remarks about politics to later be sensual, provocative, pretending to be a porn star. She does that to impress a young colleague (Matt O'Leary) who's making a sort of documentary on this group of white-wanna-be-black. She spams of character like a remote changing channels on different shows. And with those impersonations she gives us the image of a youth with no identity, damaged by drugs, television, consumerism, lack of parental attention, thinking it knows what it wants but really doesn't know. The video was innocent, more was about to come her way when she and her friend tries to join a group of Latino gang-bangers that are for real in everything they say. And this marks the turning point on her lives when they'll see that things aren't the way they appear. Better films (like ""Alpha Dog"") dealt with the subject matter in a more interesting way. What ""Havoc"" does is presenting us actors like Hathaway, Bijou Phillips, Mike Vogel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (he nailed it, though) acting like a gang, forcing some racial stereotypes at times (specially in the beginning), very over-the-top. This helps and it doesn't. They have to play this way because people who try to be something different of what they are does that. So, it's a bad acting that makes the film good, you believe (but not completely) in what they're doing. The Hispanic gang (formed by Freddy Rodriguez, Raymond Cruz and others) has better moments, but also with some clichéd stereotypes of movies that show how tough East L.A. really is. It's the most confusing aspect of the film and the one that gets the most criticism.At the same time it focuses on the issue of appearances, social backgrounds and its differences, trying to be a movie with a powerful statement ""Havoc"" fails a lot with its messy presentation. Reduces thoughts and conflicts like meaningless things or not giving the needed attention; it seems more concerned in selling a material rather than exposing the idea. It touches the skin but doesn't go deep inside. Right, they rap, use slangs and feel completely connected with the black culture and their things but you don't see them dating or having relations of any kind with African-Americans. I don't recall seeing one in the whole movie. Closes with a abrupt and horrible ending that explains the reasons why they are this way but this never fulfills our questions, doesn't make us feel sorry for them, doesn't make us feel terrified with what they've been through, it makes us too judgmental. Given a proper look one could say ""Hey, the movie is simply showing what not to do, try to be yourself and find something positive to do"". But this is being too simplistic just like the movie and it's not quite a useful reading one can make of ""Havoc"", in fact there are plenty of moments when the film seems to incite this kind of behavior, it's supportive of it. I admired some of its qualities but don't find it enough bad to be a bad picture neither too good to be a good film. It's something in between. If curious about it go ahead just for the ""fun"" of seeing people trying to be what they're not. Most of all, don't be fooled in seeing the name of Stephen Gaghan (""Traffic"", ""Syriana"") and thinking this movie is worthy of his writing credits. It's quite a disappointment. 6/10",Havoc
14,Anonymous_Maxine,Boring and trivial but not entirely inaccurate.,5,1 February 2006,"I've lived in Los Angeles for a couple of years and I know the area of the Pacific Palisades as well as the exact area in East LA where the 16th Street Gang supposedly lives, and it's not surprising to me the way these kids in this movie act. Their desperation to be accepted by hardcore criminals is wildly exaggerated, of course, but I went to a pretty rich high school and I knew tons of rich kids who drove to school in brand new Landcruisers and BMWs and pretended to have such a hard life. That act is lampooned by this movie. Anne Hathaway removes herself from a string of goofy teenybopper films and starts taking her clothes off in this one, and if I'm not mistaken it doesn't seem to have gotten her much of the attention that she thought it would. Havoc kind of came and went and was barely noticed, maybe because it's so easy to write it off as just a stupid teenage thriller.It certainly has stupid elements, but there is a lot of truth to the story that is being told, it's just unfortunate that almost all of the performances and goofy teenage caricatures were so hard to watch. Anne Hathaway plays an out of control hussy who does things like strip down and pull her breasts out for a hand-wringing high school friend who just wants to film an interview of her. He says she's sad and nervously withdraws. Does that stuff really happen? Whatever the case, the movie loses it's way at some point and, by the time the climax of the film comes around, the point where you're supposed to be all moved and upset and affected, you're so sick and tired of the characters and the movie has made itself so fake that you just don't care. Don't take this the wrong way, but the kids in this movie got exactly what they deserved.",Havoc
15,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"the fall of Western civilization? read this and weep, old guard of America",5,11 January 2016,"It is not really the movie itself I want to talk about. The movie itself is quite disappointing. Seems the Walt Disney actress took on a challenge to prove she was all nicely grown up, and bared her breasts, and I'm not complaining, only she should have done that in a better movie. Kind of like ""the only thing HAVOC got going for it, is : you know that chick from THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA? Bares her breasts here."" Psst! Little Suzy next door's favorite flick THE PRINCESS DIARIES, better not let little Suzy see this one! She'd be traumatized!The movie can only be fun if you're partial to gang-bangers and the lowlife hip-hop lifestyle. A girl like Anne Hathaway seems very obviously to have a brain that is too interconnected to fall for these dung-beetles. She is playing against type, and she fails miserably at it. Oddly enough, Bijou Philips, whom I like, make no mistake, fits in. She seems convincingly jaded enough, I suppose I'm trying to say. But I fail to see what any (white, privileged) girl would see in the cockroaches. Physical attraction? Aren't we guys always reminded in typical youth culture shows (90210, THE O.C.) that girls only go for the coolest guys? And girls tend to dress up as if they're going out to the prom every night of their lives. Why would they want to be with scumbag baboons? Stick with me and I'll reveal the answer!It's not because they find these miscreants attractive. Not even their own mothers could find hoodlums attractive. It's the thrill of danger. They get all excited about being SO OUT THERE and they get off on their own excitement. It is why Allison so earnestly explains everything with ""we get so ****ing bored!""It is a sad state when the youth of a great nation, the greatest nation ever, is so corrupted by cheap influences. Be worried, White America, be very worried. Your borders were infiltrated from within, and you're going to sink, and there's nothing that Homeland Security can do. A cultural revolution has undermined the standards of decency. The communists have won. The devil's music indeed.I'm sorry but these are the thoughts racing through my mind watching this. I believe in the beautiful creation that is mankind as I used to know it, the all-American look of days now gone by, I do not like to see it thrown away.Wake up, decent America.

17,Agent10,That stink you smell are the corpses of Barbara Kopple and Steven Gaghan,1,23 May 2006,"It takes a very special movie to put the lives and careers of so many people in danger. Barbara Kopple should never direct another movie after taking the helm of this sloppy and mismanaged piece of detritus known as a motion picture. There really is no redeeming qualities to this film except for the fact Mike Vogel is exposed as a fraud of an actor and Anne Hathaway will have to do more than smile a lot to show she can act.What makes this even more disconcerting is the fact Gaghan had a hand in this piece of crap. While the subject matter brings about some intrigue, the angle is overplayed to the point of absurdity. This is all brought about because no one in this film knows how to act or take their role seriously. The documentary kid was a putz, Hathaway was much too benign to play a vixen, and all of the Mexican characters seemed like they were acting on the fly, displaying little realism to their roles due to Kopple's lack of directorial inspiration.Of course, this will all be blamed on someone, but since it didn't cost too much money, someone will get off the hook and be allowed to work another day.

18,michaeltrivedi,Very Good,7,29 November 2019,"Here's some heavy hitting stuff. Growing up, like was just like this. It had its difference sure. But I looked back to see how different life was back then. It seems the same, but just subtle difference in the way people behaved. It was a coldness that the youth had. These days, it appears to be more open minded. It's not as cold. And this movie does a great job of showcasing that atmosphere.Havoc is about a group if kids from the Palisades who make their way into the hood one night to score weed. The girls return the next night, and start to get more involved in the gang crew. When one of them has consensual sex with the gang member, and then complains to the police that it's rape, the gang member gets put in jail. Now the gang is looking for the Palisades kids, and the Palisades kids are looking for the gang members.It's a pretty rough watch. You see the ghettos and the rich neighborhoods. It's easy to stay on your own side, and it's easy to migrate to the other side. But you are so bored of where you are, the only excitement in life could come from living something else, like the grass is always greener. These characters are experiencing that at a young age. However, the only issue is they don't know the issues that arise from crossing over. It reminds me a little of Romeo and Juliet.Do you stay on your side, or join the other? Who knows. That's life.7 stars",Havoc
19,BrandtSponseller,A middle view,7,1 December 2005,"It seems that this is one of those films that people either love or hate. I'm more in the middle. At times I found Havoc annoying, but as it progressed, the story became more engaging, and you're supposed to find aspects of it annoying.Anne Hathaway--who is trying her hardest here to distance herself from her previous Disney and family film image by choosing a role where she's naked and sexual as often as possible--plays Allison, a rich, enigmatic high school student, wrapped up with a very plastic wannabe-gangsta-rapper group of white kids. They have a minor encounter with a Mexican gang in East L.A., and Hathaway finds herself (somewhat) inexplicably drawn to the Mexican gang. She keeps returning to visit one of the leaders, Hector (Freddy Rodriguez). At one point things become more complicated, as the audience surely expects.The annoying aspect of the film is the rich kid gangsta posers. They seem incredibly fake, stupid and ridiculous. But on the other hand, that's pretty much the point. Los Angeles certainly has a reputation, somewhat deserved, for plasticity, so I suppose that Los Angeles high schools would be even worse, because a large percentage of high school students everywhere tend to conform to some clique or another (as do many adults, for that matter, but the ""join a club to fit in and be accepted"" mentality is usually more transparent and focused in high school). So the main characters should be annoying, and Allison, and later her friend Emily (Bijou Phillips), should be frustrating in their lack of direction and independent identity.The problem with Havoc, however, is that the bulk of the running time is given to this irksome, frustrating and ridiculous group of characters. That's not exactly a recipe for falling in love with a film. Both Allison and the audience will likely respond to the Mexican gang better because there is an air of authenticity present with them, thanks largely to the cast playing those roles, but they're just not in the film enough, and the climax and dénouement are far less than satisfactory in that regard. Likewise, one rich kid character who is making an amateur documentary on the rich kid ""gang"" comes across as more authentic and interesting, but he ends up having an inexcusably minor role.Still, if you can bear the inundation of poser behavior and lingo, there is an interesting story somewhat buried here, plus some attractive cinematography, a good soundtrack (both the songs and the more traditional score), and I'm certainly not complaining about seeing, um, more of Anne Hathaway. Approach this one with a lot of caution, but it's easy to see how it could be a gem for some.",Havoc
20,hall895,"Spoiled rich kids' pathetic attempts to be ""gangsta""",3,27 April 2006,"Dull, boring and at times utterly laughable...that's Havoc in a nutshell. It would appear the only reason this movie even exists is so that Anne Hathaway could shake off the Disney image and display her breasts to the world. The script gives her ample opportunities to do so...not one, not two, but three topless scenes. If you just can't go on in life without having seen Anne Hathaway's breasts go ahead and watch those scenes but you would be well advised to skip everything that comes in between the gratuitous Hathaway skin displays. The plot, such as it is, is laughable. The dialogue is so bad it's cringe-inducing. There's not a sympathetic, or even believable, character in the entire movie. It's an hour and a half of your life you'll desperately wish you could get back.The story here follows a bunch of spoiled, rich, white teenagers who apparently watched a couple of rap videos and decided they wanted to be ""gangstas."" Their pathetic attempts to act tough while driving around in Mommy's luxury car are truly hilarious. Too bad this isn't supposed to be a comedy. The central figure is Hathaway's Allison who along with her boyfriend and a couple of friends decide to take a ride into downtown L.A. to see how real gangsters live. Not surprisingly, the spoiled little rich kids are completely out of their element with Allison's boyfriend Toby actually wetting himself when confronted by Hispanic gang leader Hector. Really you couldn't make this up. Allison decides she prefers real gangster Hector to fake gangster Toby and, along with best friend Emily, heads back into the hood. Suffice to say much hilarity does not ensue.Once Allison and Emily start hanging out with the Hispanic gang (because after all urban gangsters are well known for taking preppy little white kids under their wing right?) the movie threatens to pick up a little steam. The less time spent with the fake white gang, most especially the pathetic Toby who is played by Mike Vogel in a truly laughable performance, the better. The Hispanic gang is certainly more real and more interesting and Freddy Rodriguez, who plays Hector, is far and away the best actor in the movie. But Rodriguez doesn't have much to work with here. His scenes with Hathaway, who's trying so hard to be tough and ""adult"", show just how out of her depth she really is. Bijou Phillips as Emily gives a much more mature and convincing performance. Hathaway (and her breasts) got all the attention surrounding this movie but Phillips is infinitely more memorable. Phillips and Rodriguez are the only things this movie has going for it. Hathaway is trying so hard to be sexy but, most notably in a ridiculously awkward scene where she's writhing on a couch, taking her top off and trying to talk sexy to turn on a clearly uninterested friend, her performance is just painful to watch. It's just not working, Anne. Beautiful, yes. Sexy, not so much. But she got to show the world her breasts and that seemed to be the only goal in making this film so I guess in that Havoc is a success. In every other respect Havoc is a miserable failure.",Havoc
21,Son_of_Mansfield,Watch Havoc and let slip the tears of laughter.,3,20 May 2006,"Barbara Kopple pretends that this is a documentary about interesting people. It isn't. Joseph Gordon-Levitt speaks as if he has been castrated. I hope he hasn't. Bijou Phillips takes off her shirt. It must be Tuesday. Michael Biehn and Laura San Giacomo get much needed pay checks. That's nice. There is no ending to this movie, which goes along with the slip of a plot and the shaky acting. Anne Hathaway isn't half bad, and her topless scene can be considered slightly daring, the problem is that her character needed something to happen to her. The rape of her friend would have had more impact if it had happened to her and all the impact it does have is lost when her friend tries to kill herself but isn't really up to it so she takes off her shirt again and has a bath while they laugh at how stupid she is. Actually there are some good laughs in this movie, like the wanna-be-black albinos in outfits that look like they were rejected by Jaime Kennedy for being too silly and the after school special worthy dialogue. Watch Thirteen instead, it has the stones to be mean and true.",Havoc
22,DonFishies,Not worth the celluloid it is printed on,2,7 May 2006,"So sometime in the last year, I randomly came across this film while scrolling through the IMDb's databases on one randomly boring day. Of course, there was a flurry of messages about Anne Hathaway's nudity, and speculation as to whether the film would actually come out or not. You could feel how heavy the anticipation was, even if it was for some nudity. Of course, the DVD was eventually announced (in Rated and Unrated versions no less), and the board's anticipation grew bigger. And then some scenes hit the Net, the release came and passed and it did not seem like too big a deal. I watched Brokeback Mountain and managed to see her in all her glory, while still enjoying the film. But I did not get around to catching this. Now, I fully understand reasons why I should have never bothered to have even tried.Attempting to comprehend this movie days after seeing it just hurts me.It revolves around a group of upper-class prep white kids (featuring Hathaway and Bijou Phillips), who hang around and try to attack like they're black. Of course, that's not good enough, so they start traveling to the Latin ghetto, only to get drawn into the entire scene and allow it to consume them until of course, it's too late.The film's premise does not sound too bad, but its execution is absolutely horrific.Important characters have barely any time on screen. Supporting characters come and go as they please, never really serving any real purpose. Subplots are brought up, but serve zero purpose by the end. The dialogue is just nauseating, and the story just does not gel together by the end. You go along thinking it's going to try and be realistic, but it becomes a hyper-fantasy of abysmal garbage. It wants to be real, but it does not know how to get past the fictional elements and become something real. It looks like no one put any time researching into what the movie was about, and just tried to write it based on some ideas and stories they once heard. How is the audience supposed to believe what we see if the filmmakers don't? Throwing clichés and absolutely ridiculous twists is not going to make us feel that it is more real than it is.To add to the hyper-fictionalism, there's all sorts of crazy editing and cinematography. To try and make it look real, they hyped up on the documentary style filming, and amped up on all of the drabby colours too. They want their imagined ghetto to try and look like a real ghetto, and steal everyone's techniques to try and make it so. Unfortunately, it just looks like a middle-lower class neighbourhood. There's no way this is a real ghetto. I've never even been to one myself, and I know for a fact that this is a poor excuse for a setting. Were their imaginations just not completely in tune with their magical ""gritty"" storyline? And where in the hell did they see people wearing such goofy clothing? It makes me feel abundantly worse to know an Oscar winner wrote this filth. My how Hollywood royalty never seem to stay locked in their positions.Oh, and did I mention that the ""Unrated"" version adds absolutely nothing to the film? Every person's acting in this film, from a seasoned veteran like Michael Biehn, to up-and-comers like Hathaway and Bijou, is totally amateur. I can find people off the street who could make these wooden and lifeless characters actually seem realistic and worthwhile. It's bad enough the movie sucks, but then to try and get a good cast together and make it suck even more? Come on. And then to make poor Joseph Gordon-Levitt be forced to play a one-dimensional wigger is absolutely insulting. There is no reason why none of these actors can't act in this film. They all have proved their worth before, or shortly after, so what went wrong here? But are there redeeming qualities to the film? If you count selfless nudity on part of Hathaway and Phillips that could easily be found on the Internet to be somewhat redeeming, then yes.Me? I was personally disappointed at that, even if there was more footage than in the much more worthwhile Brokeback.This movie is just straight up terrible. Every aspect of it just does not work, and just is not worth the celluloid it's printed on. Unless you really have a desire to waste 90 minutes of your life just to see some breasts you could find through Google, then I'd stay far away.2/10.",Havoc

25,MovieCriticMarvelfan,Not as good as people say even though Hathaway breaks ground,3,6 December 2005,"We'll I guess some people are more gullible than others to swallow such an average flick and call ""Independent"" and ""Edgy"" well this film is not that, nor does it break any ground with the teen drama department.What it basically boils down is Anne playing Allison, a spoiled brat, who thinks she's invincible to pain. Her boyfriend and her think their big shots and do drugs and whatever.Then her boyfriend gets cheated by a Mexican drug dealer, the dealer, pulls out a gun and her boyfriend pees his pants!!!!Yes that's really edgy film-making..not!!! Again if you read this review and disagree then you're just ignoring the truth but I digress.(Spoilers don't read unless you want to know what will happen) Anyhow Hathaway's character is more of a rich slut than a troubled teen, she seems to get joy out of manipulating people along with her other fluzy friends.She's infatuated with the Mexican drug dealer, I guess becomes she digs his male machismo, and stuff and wants to get into his gang as does her white friend Emily.They get in sort of, but when it comes down to the ""initiation"" which entails banging the dude's friend, Allison backs out but her friend stays showing her exhibition desires. Anyhow she ridiculous cries rape later when in fact she had sex with one of the gang members.Allison at one point gets busted with the gang members but is bailed by her yuppie like parents who think the strictest punishment is to ""ground her"" (yeah that'll work for spoiled brat, how about taking away her cash and money).Allison finds out about Emily's ""rape"" but she betrays her friends and says it wasn't rape.Later near the last ten minutes her cowardly boyfriend gets his friends together and gets some firearms all the way videotaping the process (yes this guy has lettuce for brains) and planning revenge on the Mexican dealer from before and you can pretty much guess where it's headed after this.This movie as you can see if you have read by this point, is predictable, boring, and not at all ""edgy"" or ""intense"", I've seen so many of these wannabee gang movies, I could make my own and call myself a director. However, let's get a few positive in here. The acting for the most part (without the cussing) is pretty good, and Hathaway does take the role seriously which I imagine was a test given the laughable material she had to work and playing the brat, her ""friends"" in this movie were OK but none of them will win Oscars for their work here.The storyline is repetitive and it just seemed to drag on and on except when it got to the obvious gratuitous sex and violence. Overall though still it's a disappointment, I can't believe Roeper recommended it as it's not that good. The characters are not really unlikable nor sympathetic.But if you're a Hathaway fan, I'am sure you'll love it. If you're mad after reading this review, get over it, there better movies out there involving the same genre.",Havoc
26,anhedonia,Kudos to Anne Hathaway,5,9 December 2005,"From the early reviews posted on this site about this film, I expected ""Havoc"" to be a rotten movie. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be pretty decent.The biggest complaint about ""Havoc"" seems to be the shock that Anne Hathaway decided to shed her clothes and get sexually explicit in this film. She's certainly not the sweet Hathaway from ""Ella Enchanted"" (2004) or ""The Princess Diaries"" films. I hope those who criticized realize that Hathaway couldn't keep playing chaste roles for the rest of her life if she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress.Good for Hathaway to want to break out of that mold, not to be pigeonholed as someone who can only play innocent roles. She's actually quite good in ""Havoc."" Her innocent appearance is perfect for Allison Lang, a young woman bored with her affluent life and, therefore, attracted to the seedy side of life, to a gang. And this film in no way glorifies her decisions because it also shows how stupid gang life is.""Havoc"" is not without its shortcomings. The dialogue, at times, seems stilted and Allison's parents, Stuart (Michael Biehn) and Joanna (Laura San Giacomo), are terribly underwritten. If the writers spent some time fleshing out these characters, that would have added much-needed depth to Allison's predicament.The sex shown in the unrated version certainly is nothing we've not seen before. And it actually seems rather mild compared to other films. I suppose the shock here is that the scenes involve Hathaway. Why that is I don't know because it's not as if she is obliged to her ""Ella Enchanted"" audience to keep playing the same roles over and over again.Director Barbara Kopple is better known for her documentaries, ""Harlan County, U.S.A."" (1976), ""American Dream"" (1991) and ""Wild Man Blues"" (1997). Her work here is competent, but nothing extraordinary. She could've been a bit more innovative with the camera work and demanded stronger parent roles. As it is, Biehn and San Giacomo play roles that could be filled by anyone from central casting. Their talent is put to no use.On the other hand, Kopple gets gritty, convincing performances from her young cast members. This film certainly revealed a side of Hathaway that I didn't know she had in her. It shows that she's more than just a sweet face; this actress can turn in a wrenching performance. An attempted seduction by Allison is awfully believable.""Havoc"" is certainly no masterpiece. And ""Thirteen"" (2003) handled similar discontentment among youths and did it better. But that doesn't mean that ""Havoc"" is a bad film. In fact, I'd rather have watched ""Havoc"" than some of this year's better reviewed films, such as ""Fever Pitch,"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Derailed."" Now those were rotten films.",Havoc

29,toqtaqiya2,A generic psychological drama which is given a boost by Hathaway's performance.,5,14 October 2012,"Havoc is a generic little film which was even screened at several film festivals. Though it didn't receive a theatrical release in America. It aims to show the differences between two classes of L.A. society, here represented by wealthy teens and latino drug dealers. In some ways this approach is mishandled and in the end the characters seem like unpleasant neurotic people. Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips play the two teens who think they're dissatisfied with their lives, so they adopt hip hop culture and go looking for adventure in a less secure part of the city. Predictably, they get mixed up in situations that they didn't expect. Hathaway replaced Mandy Moore for the role of Allison Lang after Moore dropped out of the project. Havoc aims to show the conflicts which exist in modern American society, but it goes into unnecessary territory. I felt there was no need for all the sex in the film. The characters also come off as rather stereotypical. Hathaway seems like the only one who was really giving a performance. To my surprise Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a part, though a minor one. The direction by Barbara Kopple is suitable but uninspired, and clearly influenced by American Beauty (1999) and Traffic (2000). In conclusion, Havoc is a passable film. There's little about it that's worth discussing, and it's not really surprising that the two things which drew attention to the picture are Hathaway's acting and her partial nude scenes.",Havoc

And if you don't want to ruin your teen memories of Anne Hathaway as Mia Thermopolis in The Princess Diaries or Ella in Ella Enchanted, don't watch this movie. Really. It's a perfect turnaround of her acting. I can't believe she dared to take the role. It's more than Rachel Getting Married, I guess. Well, maybe there's a reason why she decided to take this role. Yeah, I get it. She wanted to explore her acting ability, which I think is good. She's quite convincing as a black people copycat.

31,MovieZoo,"Havoc, yeah, right!",2,10 December 2005,"I admit the only reason I watched this movie was to see Anne Hathaway's contribution to the arts and to see if Richard Roeper's praise was on the mark. This was not art. What was she thinking? What was Roeper thinking? I thought maybe she chose this movie because she saw some challenge. The only challenge I believe she had was showing her breasts. Her character was shallow, and it was supposed to be. How difficult is it to play a shallow character? It couldn't have been too difficult because every one of the gang-banger-wannabes was shallow. True to life for them but so what? The parents were just as shallow. The more I watched, the more I prayed for someone to start acting. Just when I saw possibilities, I was disappointed once again.The best characters were Hector and his gang. They were the most intriguing because once Allison made contact, it became possible that someone was going to experience a change in life and Hector was truly one who could make that change. On the other hand, Allison could also make the change. Welll, it disappointed again. It isn't that a change hadn't occurred, a change did occur, but not one that would help this movie.The movie is weak and often gives one a reason to walk away. Someone wanted to tell a story that would show life on the wild side and probably encourage abstention to anyone tempted to indulge in a very tough and rough life. But the people who wanted to tell that story gave up, ironically, just like the shallow characters. The lesson was apparently lost with any hope to make this a quality film.One last thing, if anyone can find a character to relate to, good luck to you. Good luck to Anne, too. Maybe now that Anne has bared her breasts, she will be able to bare her soul in a role more deserving.2/10 is the best I can do.

32,badgrrlkane,Not a bad independent film.Strong performance from Anne Hathaway &Freddy Rodriguez.,7,13 January 2006,"First off I've never understood ""children"" who have studied the black rap/hip-hop & gang culture & then decided to make them selves look & sound as uneducated as possible by becoming "" wiggers"" It's just a sub-culture i don't understand yet this film as in the previous film 1999's ""Whiteboy"" shows that when these usually rich white kids go bouncing around in inner city ghettos they either find one of 3 things: death,a good butt-kicking from the people their idolizing, or the police/jail. Anne Hathaway who's been itching to ditch the ""good-girl"" persona that both Princess Diary film & Ella Enchanted portrayed her as,has got rid of the good girl roles with this film Havoc & with Brokeback Mountain by showing her nice ample breasts several times in this film & by humorously trying to smoke crack & going down on her ""wigga"" boyfriend,played quite well by the very cute Mike Vogel. Bijou Phillips once again does a good supporting girlfriend role & Joesph Gordon Leavitt shine in this film as well as he did in Mysterious Skin. Freddy Rodriguez was convincing as the gang member that Anne Hathaway becomes hot for until in a very un-realistic scene Anna & Bijou decide they too want to be a part of the Mexican gang lifestyle & asked to be initiated, which requires them to roll the dice & whatever number they come with, they have to sleep with that many of the gang members. Anne gets one, & you know she picks Freddy but Bijou gets 3! Then in the middle of starting Anne decides she can't do it, but Bijou decides she's doing this & she wants Freddy first. Then as Freddy pounces on her, his brother comes in for the orgy & she starts screaming ""No Stop""! Which, by all rights if they don't stop it is rape, & in the film they stop.But,in real life? No way! She would've been gang-raped as would've ms Hathaway & they probably would've been tricked out on the street corner or killed. Stupid White Girls is what they really should've called this film. So,except for a few unconvincing scenes it was/is a decently made film. *** out of *****",Havoc
33,MetalAngel,"Tries to be powerful and affecting, but it doesn't go too deep. Still, it's entertaining.",7,25 August 2009,"Many people complain that this film is anything but good, and they dismiss it as simple trash that overreached while trying to be affecting. Well, I'm not one of them. I am one of those who think this is, in fact, an interesting film, and very well worth the hour and a half I spent watching it.I suppose most of the negative reviews towards this film come from the fact that it did not reach the expectations people had of it. I mean take director Barbara Kopple (yes, the documentary genius director), screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (who also wrote classics like Traffic and Syriana) and Anne Hathaway in a powerfully explosive role...you'd normally expect a highly artistic, disturbingly deep and intelligent film. This film isn't any of the above, even though it TRIES to be. Nevertheless, as I've mentioned before, it does have an interesting enough plot.It's about two rich teenagers (Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips) who are going through their rebellious teenager stage where drinking, heavy flirting and hanging out with the tough guys is in vogue. They decide to cross over from their posh neighborhoods into downtown East side, (the Latino side, really) where hard drugs, gang violence and gun fights are at the order of the day. These teens are impressed (to put it mildly) with how ""real"" everything seems in the East side, and are soon begging to be admitted into the hazardous Latino gang...with expectable detrimental results.The film tries to discuss really profound and disturbing points of view, and even though it DOES tackle some issues, it all seems a bit off. Hathaway is, of course, a revelation in her first challenging role, but the rest of the actors are a bit off. In fact, everything about the movie is a bit off. Even Stephen Gaghan, who writes the screenplay, offers us a probing look into the breaches of society and the cause and effect that lead our two protagonists in a downward spiral, but he refuses to reach deeper to actually make the audience care and feel enveloped by the psychological turmoil going on-screen.I'm sure I'm portraying this to be a base and horrible film, but it isn't. I feel I watched something entertaining and that serves as an illustration to other similar films I've watched before. It's an interesting movie to seek out, and I really do recommend it, but I hope you aren't expecting a masterpiece. Just watch it 'for the fun of it' (even if this phrase sounds a bit ironic).Rating: 2 and a half stars out of 4!",Havoc
34,LARSONRD,A Compelling teen drama,7,4 March 2007,"Filmed in 2005 but not released until this year on DVD, this was a compelling story about rich teens acting all Hip Hop in Pacific Palisades who drive into East L.A. for kicks and getting involved with one of the gangs there, with pretty awful results. The teens are essentially brainless pleasure-seeking partiers (many critics derided them for being one-dimensional, but I think that was the whole point  showing the shallowness of their lives and the bad choices they made, seeking better kicks without really understanding what they were getting into, their naivete about gangs and their misplaced self-confidence in their own sexuality to keep them popular and liked and safe, was shown to be demonstrably inappropriate. Their attitudes, weaned on parental neglect, casual sex, and playing roles they weren't up to (the kids pretend to be hip hop without ever really understanding that culture; everyone in the film is shown to be a phony  pretending to be someone they're not), are mired in superficiality (one of the characters says, when facing a choice to join the gang if she'll sleep with three of their members, says, ""why not? It's just sex!""  a telling moment). Most IMDb reviewers panned the movie but I felt it was an honest and intriguing drama about choices and consequences. Anne Hathaway's performance is a far cry from her Disneyesque cute roles in PRINCESS DIARIES and even DEVIL WEARS PRADA  she sells the character of the vapid, shallow rich kid whose attitude about life and love and sex (""it's just a performance, after all"") quite nicely  that's what drew me to the film, and I felt she did a good job. Freddy Rodriguez, whose performances I've always liked since he did SIX FEET UNDER, is very good as a gang member/drug dealer  and despite those who claimed all the characters were on-dimensional, I felt he added a lot of subtle depth to his role  humanizing it beyond the cardboard gang member he started out to be. There is a depth behind his eyes and behind his words as he confronts Hathaway and her sexy friends, and becomes as manipulated by them even while trying manipulate them for his own purposes. The other gang members were also very convincing  or at least they seemed so to me. Laura San Giacomo and Michael Biehn are very good as in small roles as Anne's misunderstood but inattentive parents, who are facing their own marital issues. The film ends on an intentional note of ambiguity but one I felt was quite effective  the story stops while you're still thinking about it. The specific conclusion  who dies and who doesn't  isn't the point and in the end doesn't really matter  either way, it's the inevitable result of the poor choices and lack of any kind of personal responsibility in the lives of these kids that is the point of the film. Like THIRTEEN, I felt this was a very interesting examination of youth and its choices and influences and vulnerability. I may be eons away from the age group portrayed by the teens in this film, but I found the picture to be a satisfying and involving human drama with real performances and real issues.",Havoc
35,hjames-97822,OK. I Watched It To See Just How Bad It Really Is,1,18 May 2015,"And it is...Bad. Really, really bad.If I were Anne Hathaway's parents I would be embarrassed to ever see my grown child performing in such a manner. Honestly, if what she wanted to do was shed her Disney image, she succeeded and in spades. Of course, I was personally embarrassed for her when I saw her in Love and Other Drugs. But that's another story.No spoilers from me this time. It's all out there to see and read about right here. Totally useless, gratuitous sex and violence scenes. Just boring, really. Directors have dumped so much of this stuff on us over the past 15 or 20 years I just really am tired of it. How much longer can we be expected to pay $9.00 for a matinée ticket plus snacks to see some guy's manicured butt and the bare breasts of any number of interchangeable white women? Sex is nothing you need real training for. Billions of people have it billions of times a day. The planet is awash in bodily fluids. How many more times can I be told an integral part of storytelling is a close up of some man's chest hair growing around his nipples. Or watching an Anne Hathaway type shove her face between his legs in faux oral sex? I've just had enough.I will go so far as to say that the Latino actors in this film sizzle with a far, far more genuine sex appeal than Ms. Hathaway or any of her female counterparts. Please start making films again. Please stop relegating me to a voyeuristic peanut gallery where I am made to feel like I am in a peep show arcade. Please stop catering to the lowest possible brainless members of your audience. Not all of us are Judd Apatow aging frat boy groupies who don't care.I long for a really great story. I am tired of being shocked. Make me cry for a change. It may be enhanced if the Anne Hathaways and her ilk (as well as her many male counterparts) consider staying dressed. For once.",Havoc
36,Tony43,A walk on the wildside,9,14 July 2006,"This is an interesting film, but not half as interesting as many of the reviews posted on this forum -- reviews that say kids believe that if you are going to depict their lives, you'd better get it letter perfect. But the comments here also point to something else -- that white kids from affluent communities posing as rappers or gangsters are so embarrassing that kids would rather they not be put on the screen in the first place.I personally cannot attest to the authenticity of this problem -- rich white kids who are wannabe gangbangers -- but I had heard of it before, so I assume the problem exists. I have also driven around Los Angeles for years and while most of the rap music blaring out of cars comes from cars driven by blacks, I have seen plenty of white kids cranking up the volume, too, so I am inclined to believe this really does go on.So, is Barbara Kopple's film believable? Only partially. The idea of bored rich kids looking for ""kicks"" has been used in American movies since the silent era, so there is little new here. Even the idea that foolish rich girls might seek out and start affairs with gangster types is also old hat in Hollywood. (But in the film's defense, I think some of the young reviewers who have posted comments here misunderstood the film. While Allison and her girlfriend told the Latino gangbangers they wanted to join their ""crew"", they really meant join the gang for a couple of nights of excitement. Clearly, they would have grown bored with that life, too, in a matter of days and moved on to something else.) And yes, the film got it very wrong when it showed the gangsters who were in the process of having sex with the girls just meekly say ""ok"" when the girls had a change of heart. No, in all probability that would have never happened and both girls would have been raped. Attempts to prove that there was enough between Allison and Hector for him to have honored her wishes was simply wishful thinking on the part of the filmmakers. While asking permission every step of the way may be accepted practice in feminist circles, that idea probably has not yet taken root in the world of Latino gangbangers.Even the concept of the white kids venturing into gang territory to buy drugs, much less look for a fight, seemed a little far fetched in reality. Unless these rich, white high school kids are illiterates, they would have had to know the murder rate in gang infested areas of both south and East Los Angeles is staggering.Still, the gangster mystic has always been attractive, except when it is laid bare in front of us. No scene in this movie is a powerful to my mind as the scene towards the end where the white boys pose and posture for the camera, aping the black rapper ""attitudes"" they have seen in so many rap videos. That was a pretty good statement about life imitating ""art"" which seems to be one of America's premiere problems these days. I think this was part of the film that offends so many kids writing on this forum. No one likes to be made a fool of and these white boys looked truly foolish.Lastly, comes the big question about this film --Anne Hathaway. She is the star, the person around whom the plot really revolves. Strangely, in a film about the negative affects of trying to live up to images, image seems to be central here to her casting and performance. She does seem too old and far too sophisticated to be a high school girl and if she were one, she would be a girl dating college age boys. She would have found her wannabe gangster classmates juvenile and just plain embarrassing. Was her acting up to snuff? Without a doubt. She actually did a good job with the role, within I suspect the parameters of what her director wanted of her. Then, of course, comes the question, did Anne Hathaway take this picture to shed her good girl image and get directors to start thinking about her handing more mature roles? No doubt about it. Doing not one but two scenes where she appears topless, in one of which she simulates performing oral sex on a boy, certainly gets you away from a Disney image.Is her career going down hill from here? Obviously, just the opposite. ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" her breakthrough role, has already grossed something approaching $65 million and will no doubt do $100 million or more before it is done. It is a picture almost guaranteed to do well on DVD, with almost every woman in America wanting to sneak a look at the clothes in it. So ""Havoc"" will give her exactly what she wanted -- something she can steer casting directors to when she wants them to see she is willing to take risks and play ""edgier"" characters.",Havoc
37,czarnobog,Intense Steamy Social Drama - Not for Prudes,10,22 June 2006,"This movie starts off on a somewhat generic note, looking like ""The O.C."" meets ""Sex, Lies and Videoptape."" But once it gets rolling it really rocks.Barbara Kopple is the latest director to blow the lid off the conventional Hollywood ""wisdom"" that older filmmakers can't do teens right. Like Larry Clark and Gus van Zant, she delivers incredibly believable, naturalistic characters, free from the crappy ""teen dialog"" so prevalent in typical Hollywood fare.Kudos to Anne Hathaway for bravely and aggressively shedding her Disney image, and to Bijou Phillips, who is hands down the reigning sex kitten of cinema, once again delivering a performance which would pop a gasket in John Ashcroft's heart.This is not the first film to deal with suburban ""wiggers"" getting into trouble by pushing their gangsta posing too far into the real world. Marc Levin did a pretty good job with Whiteboyz. But Havoc is the best. Interestingly, both Levin and Barbara Kopple began their careers directing documentaries.The gang members depicted in this movie are as real as they get, and thankfully they are not one-dimensional clichés.The plot line is fairly simple with an obvious outcome, but if you like intense personal drama with a very dark, sexy edge, this is as good as it gets.",Havoc

I couldn't understand what was he doing. Mike Vogel looked stupid. Nothing seemed serious. How can so many actors play so bad in one movie? Only the latinos were seeming believable. That was just plain ridiculous. I just wish the camera boy was Aaron Ashmore, he would make a movie worth some more points. And what was that all about? Apart from the horrible acting the movie has nothing interesting in it's plot. Why did they make it at all?? I am shocked how a movie with so many famous actors can be so crappy.

Sure the teen age girls' roles seem unduly exaggerated -- until one recalls the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. Sure the slice of life of the East LA macho culture seems cliché. But welcome to the real world, folks. Except for the opening scenes which seemed to me to be unduly dark, once the players started getting into the wilderness of the teen age mind, my attention was riveted on every scene. All the actors were outstanding in their roles, their pain, their anger, their abandoned adventuresomeness, their loneliness,their lack of understanding and dismay of a real world portrayed and captured by the camera in every shot of their eyes.I was reminded of a socially conscious and quite lovely California girl I met many years ago. She had signed on for one of JFK's programs to bring light to our city ghettos. Her first venture in establishing understanding between diverse cultures resulted in her being gang banged, not by any implied invitation but in brutal retaliation for having the temerity to enter Chicago's black ghetto culture. When her body healed, she went back to her Peace Corp-like duties and was again gang-banged. This time, after she got out of the hospital, she went home to California.",Havoc

It is also apparently safe to park that Mercedes convertible with the top down on the street in East LA without having it stolen or stripped.Gang members are totally approachable and harmless to outsiders. They even stop having sex with you after you ask them to.The acting by the young male ""wiggers"" was just plain laughable. As if three 17 year old high school boys would actually contemplate confronting gang members with weapons on those gang members home turf no less.And the point of this movie was? A seemingly intelligent, wealthy girl decides she wants to go to East LA for kicks because she is bored?

42,lawfella,Hollywood rebels without a cause -- where are you James Dean?,5,4 May 2006,"Negative comments about this film need to be tempered by the sad story surrounding its making. The script was written by a 17-year old girl named Jessica Kaplan. No, It's not Citizen Kane, but it is an extraordinary piece of work for a teenager. And most sadly, she perished in an airplane crash at the age of 21. The film is dedicated to her memory.As to the film's merits, it is by my count the 1,464th variation of Rebel Without A Cause, which I think said all that needed to be said on the subject. Did you know that adolescents often find society empty and pointless? And that they do stupid things by way of rebelling against it, in hopes of dispelling their angst and finding something more meaningful? Yes, it's true. In this version of that old chestnut, the rebels are a particularly spoiled group of high school students living in Hollywood. To find something they consider ""real"", they form youth gangs in imitation of the poor folk in East L.A. And then they actually go there, at first to buy drugs; but then rich girls Anne Hatahway and Bijou Phillips try to get involved in the local Hispanic gang scene. Some pretty modest mayhem ensues.The East L.A. people are awfully sanitized and not very believable. Nobody is addicted to anything. Nobody is desperate. Nobody appears to be poor. These are basically solid middle class folk, devoted to family, who have a few surface quirks and who happen to sell crack cocaine instead of, say, life insurance.Is it my imagination or does the gorgeous Bijou Phillips always play exactly the same role -- a sexually eager girl who gets in over her head, discovering the hard way that yes, she has limits? That's the role she plays here, and she is fine (as is lead Anne Hatahway). But I wonder whether that is her entire repertoire. Perhaps she will branch out someday.Somewhere on this planet, there must be some group of people more deserving of sympathy than affluent Hollywood teenagers. So I found myself wondering why this film had been made. The young scriptwriter should not be held accountable, but you would think older people would know better.",Havoc

Allison and her ""crew"" Emily (Bijou Phillips), Amanda (Shiri Appleby), Sasha (Alexos Dziena) and boyfriend Toby (Mike Vogel) enjoy emulating gang lifestyle, right down to the clothes, music, and fights. Allison's group is called PTC, and they get into a fight with another crew at the beginning of the film, and Allison is right in the middle, punching and kicking.After disposing of the rival crew, Allison's crew decides to try to buy some cocaine. It is here that they run into Hector (Freddy Rodriguez) and his crew. Toby buys the drugs from Hector, but Toby accuses him of gyping them. A confrontation occurs between Hector and Toby, and Allison steps in at the last minute to save Toby from being shot. Afterward, Toby retreats into himself, but Allison becomes intrigued with Hector and the entire gang culture.Allison and the girls decide to go to a party hosted by Hector, and they are soon drinking and fooling around with Hector and his friends. Later on, Allison and Emily decide they want to join Hector's crew. Hector tells them that they must roll dice, and the number that comes up is the number of crew members they must sleep with. Allison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three. Allison chooses Hector, and Emily chooses another member of the crew. They go into a hotel room and begin making out. After a few minutes, Allison breaks it off with Hector, but Emily keeps going. Unfortunately for Emily, things get a little rough, and Allison comes in and saves her.Emily claims she was raped and decides to press charges against Hector and the others.

While driving back, Toby crosses paths with Hector's crew, and as the screen fades out, gunshots are heard. What will become of Allison and Emily? Anne Hathaway definitely loses her G-rated innocence from her ""Princess Diaries"" days by appearing nude in this film. Her swearing and drug use further separate her from her earlier films.As for the plot, it only kept me mildly interested. There is constant swearing and nudity throughout the film, so it is definitely not an appropriate movie for younger viewers. The lack of character development is also disappointing. Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips do a fairly good job, but the rest of the acting is only average.I cannot give this movie a very high recommendation.

49,ivanm-5,Great movie about first impressions that starts with a bad one!,9,5 March 2007,"""Havoc"" is definitely one of the best low-budget American movies I have seen for some time. I'm not saying that it is an out-and-out masterpiece but it certainly beats most of the Hollywood efforts I have seen in the past couple of years by some distance. I'm sure that, had it been a European production, it would have received a lot more accolades than brickbats.Although the film has simplistic plot-line about rich kids getting into trouble on the ""wrong side of the tracks"", this is just the backbone upon which director Barbara Koppel hangs an astute study of false impressions. In some cases these false impressions are created deliberately as in rich soft white kids pretending to be hardened gangsta rappers. At other times they are born of prejudice and misunderstandings.There is a wonderful scene early in the film when Allison (Anne Hathaway) walks around the kitchen of her home reading the post-its that her parents have left for each other. In those few brief moments we are given an insightful impression (yes that word again) of her totally dysfunctional family while later on, when they bail her out of jail, they appear to be the perfect concerned parents.The film is very much a vehicle for Hathaway and she carries out her responsibilities with aplomb. Her performance is well worthy of the DVD ""Best Actress"" award that she received for it.The much talked about nudity is neither excessive nor exploitative and would probably not even be mentioned if this was a film from outside of the USA. What we do see is totally in keeping with the story and, if anything, the motel room scene involving Emily (Bijou Phillips) is rather tame.The only major fault with the film is the director's brave (foolhardy?) decision to begin with a scene containing appallingly bad dialogue and wooden acting. This gives (ironically) the false impression that we are about to see a particularly bad hip-hop movie. This is a deliberate part of the story rather than a reflection of the script and the actors. The fact that the scene includes a student capturing these antics on video should be enough to alert the viewer to this fact but, judging from many comments and reviews, this seems to have passed many people by (including some so-called professional critics). Perhaps this is one case where non-linear storytelling would have helped the film.The final climactic scene is highly unusual (close to being unique I would say) and certainly leaves you thinking.Don't be surprised if this film turns out to considered something of a classic at some time in the future.",Havoc

Hathaway and her female cast mates do an OK job portraying vapid tramps but their boyfriend characters are completely over the top.

51,KiteVega,Could have been Better,6,7 October 2007,"To be honest, I only watched this movie because of all the bad press it received - the poor acting, poor writing, vapid script and pointless storyline were just a few things that were panned about this flick. However, when I came to watch it, I didn't think it was all that bad. In the most superficial sense it is an entertaining enough movie with plenty of violence, trashy outfits, drug-speak and half-naked nubile girls. However, what is so frustrating about this film is the way the writers have tried to thread the storyline together with some sort of moral message that never really comes across or feels valid. There is some sort of 'Be yourself, stay out of trouble, keep your nose clean and know your place' message throughout that seems terribly basic, when all is said and done, but the film's outcome makes all the pseudo-moral hand-wringing seem somewhat wind-blown in the end. After suffering an indignity brought on by their own foolish actions, the 'heroines' of the piece, Emily and Allison, both go running home to their rich parents, have a tiny spat; and then after a misguided attempt to end it all by Emily, they end up giggling away as if nothing has happened, while their ridiculous 'wigga' boyfriends face the wrath of the East LA gangsters. Whatever moral message their is, is therefore squashed beneath a hollow attempt at an 'explosive' ending. Other minor complaints would include the dialogue mostly not ringing true, as well as the obvious fact that Alison and Emily would have surely suffered far more greatly at the hands of the gangsters. At the end of it all, the most rounded, sympathetic and interesting character in the film was Freddy Rodriguez' Hector, and as he was basically portrayed as little more than a compulsive drug-dealing, skirt-chasing potential rapist, that's not saying much. This film could've been a lot better, and it's a shame that it lost it's meaning under a flurry of gratuitous and pointless drug-taking and nudity.",Havoc

54,tchockythegreat,A promising premise and a solid performance wasted,3,28 January 2009,"Despite the fact that this movie is like the umpteenth variation of Rebel Without A Cause, anybody who has gone to a high school in an affluent area in the last decade and seen the amount of pampered young 'wiggers' there are knows that the premise of this flick is relevant to today's youth and is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the movie fails to deliver on this promising premise and only succeeds in wasting a fine performance from Anne Hathaway.The movie WANTS to make a powerful statement about spoiled, naive, pseudo-disillusioned youths searching for identity in the superficial only to receive a colossal reality check when they realize the life they've been imitating isn't as glamorous as they had thought. Unfortunately, this noble message is lost in a weak script and characters that are either one-dimensional, unbelievable or both. Although one must consider the fact that the screenplay was for the most part written by a 16-year-old girl before judging it, it is disappointing that an Academy Award-winning co-writer with some experience with this genre of film (Stephen Gaghan) could not give the screenplay and characters a more authentic feel.Even if it was the screenwriter's intention to make the script's dialogue horrible for the sake of legitimizing just how inane the gang of rich white teens are acting, the horrid screen writing comes off so cartoonish that the viewer will have an extremely difficult time accepting the dialogue, and consequently the behavior, of these characters as being legitimate. As a result, the gang of rich white wannabe thugs come off, for the most part, as being overwrought caricatures saddled with some of the most laughably horrible dialogue ever heard in a motion picture. As for the gang of cholo thugs in the movie, they come off as being far too nice and too stereotypical to Latinos, and thus seem only marginally less cartoony that the gang of rich white kids.The movie's lone saving grace is Anne Hathaway. Playing a role that shares some parallels with and could be considered a natural extension of her smart-girl-with-a-rebellious-streak Meghan Green character from the short-lived TV series Get Real, hers was the only character in the movie that had any sort of depth and believability. The script, despite its many shortcomings, succeeds in making it clear just how self-aware, intelligent, and capable of good Hathaway's character is, in spite of her actions as a member of the gang of rich white teens, giving the film its lone three-dimensional character. Because of Hathaway's talent as an actress, as well as her successful exploitation of the public's predominant perception of her as a wholesome girl next door for this film, it is easy for the audience to believe that Hathaway's character is the rebel-without-a-clue fish out of water that the script is trying to portray her as. Hathaway's acting is superb, head and shoulders above anyone else in the film, which adds to her character's legitimacy. However, the people who see this movie will likely be too busy snickering at the inane lines of dialogue she's repeatedly forced to drop or, more likely, be gaping at their TV thinking ""O...M...G! The chick from The Princess Diaries is actually TOPLESS!"" to notice her solid performance.Which leads to a discussion of arguably the biggest reason most people even know this film exists. Hathaway has claimed in interviews that she only does nudity in films if she deems it necessary to the story. While a case can be made that most of the nudity in the film was appropriate when considering the context of the scenes in which it was featured, I find myself questioning just how ""necessary"" it is, for example, to show Hathaway's character popping her top while making out with her boyfriend (or for that matter, to see Bijou Phillips' character in the film topless while taking a bubble bath). That's not to say this movie should be mistaken for a late-night film on Skinemax; it most certainly isn't. But Hathaway is topless just enough in this film to make this obvious attempt to expand her acting repertoire beyond the roles in family films she had previously been limited to seem heavy-handed and maybe even a little desperate. Anne, take it from me, you're a wonderful actress. That alone will do more to land you mature roles than taking off your top for sex scenes in a poorly-scripted indie movie ever will.When all is said and done, the amount of nudity in this movie only made it worse; when you factor the amount of it in along with in how disappointing the movie is, it only adds evidence to the argument that the only reason this movie exists was for Hathaway to prove to us just how far she was willing to go to avoid being typecast as Princess Mia Thermopolis for the rest of her acting career...which is a shame, considering her legitimately solid acting job in this movie.Rent ""Kids"" or ""Thirteen"" instead; both films are about topics similar to this movie and both are far better.",Havoc

Havoc tells the story of the kids from the Palisades. Rich kids who act ""street"" or ""ghetto"" if you will. They even have a cute little gang. The actual plot of the movie is a little bland and a little predictable, but the plot is surrounded by a documentary being made by a Palisades kid about the rich kids. Anne Hathaway, Bijou Phillips, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the other guy decide since they are so hardcore that they're going to try to score some pot from East L.A. In return, they are swept into a crazy world of actual poverty, crime, and drugs. The two girls (Hathaway & Phillips) become intrigued by this world and decide to become a part of it. Of course, as predicted, they get in over there head and realize that they do not belong in that world. This movie was okay. That's all I can say. It didn't suck, but it wasn't great.

The biggest dis is against the Chicano gang members. What walking talking stereotypes. I kind of like the white guy wiggers, as as sort of clown squad. Actually a decent ""send up"" of those kinds of guys. The girls are just silly, but no it is not okay gang bang 16 year- olds. And yes, the barrio is one dangerous frigging place to be hanging out getting high, particularly if you are so white you basically glow in the dark. Among other things, is it really credible that the Chicano girls would not have a lot to say about a bunch of rich bitches suddenly in their midst. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made.

In my youth I've heard late night gunshots at least once a month and never really knew what they were. Everybody had rod iron covering their windows.These parties that you see in these types of movies rarely ever happen. Rich white kids party every single weekend. Poor minorities are too busy working 6am-10pm and fearing for their lives. They leave the lights on to deter robbers, not because they're having a party.Now let's move onto Pacific Palisades. Do 90% of the white kids act black? Well, yeah, ever since Eminem and Dave Chappelle, everyone wants to be black and be funny. It's obnoxious but kids will be kids. It's not who they truly are. But then again, how well do YOU know yourself? They can either act black to fit in or have no friends.

Anne Hathaway plays an 'over-sexed bad girl. She becomes bored with her rich, white suburban life & looks for thrills in the ghetto. The importance of Anne Hathaway character's traits in the movie, is the fact that her aggressiveness towards danger & the appeal she finds in the ghetto life, get her friend(s) in trouble. Anne, adds depth to her character but in the end, no matter what she does, the movie falls flat.At the end, the story becomes insulting to the audience's attention.

Anyway, I give it to her to have the balls to take in on. The gang guys did the best with what they had to work with. Oh well, my TIVO taped it for me or I would have never seen it.HOWEVER- I cannot help but feel dega-vu every time I see Bijoux Phillips in a role, so much so that I had to come and see if anyone else is thinking the same. Good grief girl, get a new angle!!! She is the go to actress when its a rich kid gone wild movie and they need someone to act all hot until she practically gets raped or something goes wrong. It baffles me that someone would even put her in this movie because she is the same person over and over again in these ""controversial"" teen gone bad movies.

63,flyingwong,"Is this supposed to be a drama or comedy? The ""Showgirls"" of the ""Good Teens Gone Bad"" Movie Genre",1,15 April 2006,"From the first line of this movie where Anne Hathaway offers the ""deluded and jaded"" rich kid line of ""You wanna know how it is for us in the Palisades?"" to her fellow rich kid documentary making classmate-- I knew this movie was pretty much the Showgirls of ""Bad teens"" movies. And I was right! Everything from the unnecessary dialogue about chips and nails, pretentious drug scenes, faux bisexual tension, and the drama drama drama rape scene had me wondering if Elizabeth Berkeley should have been cast in this had it been made ten years ago. But at least Showgirls is fun to watch. This was.... ugh....My boyfriend and I rented this ""should be a coaster"" DVD and the first scene is all these irritatingly rich white kids ""oozing"" with hip hop street cred-- I don't know if this was supposed to teach me about how it really is for rich white kids or usher in the comic relief right off. It was very Jaime Kennedy-esquire except they were serious-- I think. Then they beat up on a bunch of kids of color in the parking lot, and actually kick their asses and escape before the police come. That would never happen in real life. I turned to my boyfriend and said, ""Why did you rent this?"" Even he couldn't stand it and walked out in the first twenty minutes. Anne Hathaway (who is great in Brokeback Mountain) shows that every good actress has her day at the bottom. She is so annoying. Especially when she tries to talk all hip hop. And then when she starts singing R&b lyrics-- what was that about? I know this is supposed to be part of her persona, but please. I wasn't sure who I was supposed to be sympathetic for. Why I was supposed to care for any of these people? Was I supposed to feel bad for her being so bored and unloved? I found myself at the rape scene going, ""Ok, if they learn nothing from this then this movie really has lost me."" And the girls don't seem to learn anything. For some reason Anne Hathaway refuses to call the gang rape a ""rape"" because the two of them originally consented to going into the room with the latino gang members and being ""initiated""-- I don't know why she wants to split hairs, or why she knows nothing about ""date rape"" but that (really horribly graphic scene) looked like a rape to me, and yet she goes as far as telling her raped friend's parents that it wasn't ""technically"" a rape. To me this is very angering and I really hope that women don't go around thinking that something like that is not rape, but rather a sad ass attempt to drag a terrible story out further. Was the intent of her defending the gangsters a way of evoking pity for the gangsters? For the girls to accept some kind of responsibility for being so stupid?And don't even get me into the logistics...Living in Los Angeles, most of the basic logic of this story doesn't make sense. For example-- the rich kids are driving to the ""hood"" after school to befriend the gangsters but in reality the drive from the Palisades to Downtown LA is at least two hours in traffic at that hour. Why does Anne Hathaway show up unannounced to the gangster's house and try to avenge her friend's rape. Why is she still able to party and go out even though her parent's reprimanded her and should be a little less clueless? Why is Anne Hathaway able to find the gangsters whenever she seeks them out? It's like she is able to find them in three spots.Why do Anne Hathaway and her friend agree to be initiated into the Latino gang with what is obviously going to be a gang rape? Why do they want to be in that gang so bad when they are already hanging with them? Anne Hathatway shows up at her friends parents house after the rape, they say, ""we need some distance"" (basically, ""get the f out of our house you bad friend""). Then Anne Hathaway says all these things to discount her friend's rape experience, her friend is all mad and runs off and yet her parents still let Anne Hathaway run upstairs to comfort her while her friend tries to slit her wrists. Why? Why? Why do these gangsters look and sound like they came out of the c-movie version of ""Stand and Deliver""? Why was this movie made? Why did nobody see how poor the writing was? How unsympathetic the characters were? WHY? WHY?!Wanna see a better movie? Try Thirteen, Kids, Traffic or Showgirls.",Havoc

So instead of Allison and her friends living out the life they are living. They get brought into the Latino gangster life by choice which in a way kind of added to the movie.

Like I said, Anne Hathaway who played Allison was actually very convincing and as whom she was.

71,fixyourcat,Was it Really Necessary?,5,25 February 2006,"This movie was often times painful to watch, and it's not because of its ""moving"" subject matter. It's possible the filmmakers aren't at fault, here, because when you make a movie about irritating people, don't be surprised that the viewers will find themselves irritated. But if you take on a film that'll make people's brains hemorrhage, you probably deserve to be booed.Honestly, though, after seeing this piece of crap, I'm surprised Stephen Gaghan can still get work in Hollywood. Likewise for Hathaway, who does a respectable job with a vastly mundane script. Not so kudos to Bijou Philips, for whom playing trash isn't exactly a huge stretch or test of acting ability, nor to Freddy Rodriguez, who, to make his speech more threatening, actually slows himself down so much that he starts. Speaking. In. Fragments. Of the trio, though, he may be the most surprising transformation, especially since he's so squeaky on ""Six Feet Under."" It was unexpected, but it may have been a casting mistake. Instead of appearing threatening, he looks more like he has Short Man's Syndrome, since Hathaway has a head of height on him, and may appear more menacing therefore. I know I shouldn't be so astounded, but it stupefies me still, how far Hollywood will go to make the worst casting decisions in the name of getting someone proximately famous for the DVD cover. Oy...I think the most irksome thing about ""Havoc"" is that, in the end, it's a vacuous morality tale. They had a chance to make something of the examination of bored, rich teenagers who want to be poor on purpose, but they instead glazed over it. No one involved has long-lasting suffering. It's like the whole thing was just a bad dream, which is, I suppose, a fitting description of a night spent watching ""Havoc,"" a most aptly-titled film. The most disappointing aspect of the whole deal is that the personal responsibility lesson isn't given enough gravity. Bored, unlikable, upper-class adolescents get in a wee bit of trouble with a Latin gang of their own accord? My cup overfloweth. Honest to God, if I have to hear another person defend an individual's actions on the basis of the ""It's only your fault until you get hurt; then, you can blame someone else"" line, I'm going to implode. And guess what ""Havoc"" does? Bottom line: if you're looking for half-naked girls, you've hit the jackpot. Also, if you're a teenager and you're looking for some kind of searing expose of the ""Gee, I think I'll go join a gang today"" lifestyle, you, too, are in luck.

But more to the point - if this film in any way represents teen character in today's affluent social circles, I feel sorry for the good 'ol USA. I think it is an exaggeration of reality but I'm sure it hits the mark at times. The portrayal of the Hispanic groups in east L.A. is hit or miss as well. Rodríguez' script is simple minded at best, and no spoiled rich chick is going to be able to impose herself into the culture unchallenged by 'las chicas'. An obvious irony is when Rodríguez makes comment to the effect of how their culture is more that just a bunch of hoodlum drug dealers when there is no indication, none mind you, of any of them doing anything other than partying, selling drugs, and ""defending"" there territory.

The premise of the story intrigued me, I'm not a white person myself (which might be why I can see it from an unbiased standpoint, because I'm not Latino or Black either), but I grew up in New York City, so I can vouch for it's accuracy, because California isn't the only place that has ""wiggas"".This movie could have been done with more class, the nudity was definitely unnecessary, they could've gotten the exact same point across having Hathaway and Phillips keep their bras on (as one of the other commentators said, some things would have been better off left to the imagination, and this was definitely one of those things). Because this shows yet again, the hypocritical double standard in Hollywood, that exposing a woman's breasts are no big deal, but exposing a man's privates, even in the unrated version mind you, is still a taboo. I don't know why Hathaway, as stunningly beautiful as she is, would see the need to take such a blemishing role. Some of the most respected actresses in Hollywood have the decency to put their foot down and refuse to do full on nudity in movies, such as Jennifer Aniston and Sarah Jessica Parker, and they are respected more for it. Elizabeth Berkley tried this same 360 move with Showgirls, and she's practically been laughed out of Hollywood with a scarlet letter ""S"" branded on her (those were her own words!).Choosing Hathaway in particular to play a role like this is unconvincing since she looks like she's in her late 20s yet she's portraying a teenager, her face looks too angelic and smiley to be playing such a devious character.The writing was a little skewed as well, some of the things that they had Hathaway say (such as, ""teenagers think they are invincible""), is not something an actual teenager would say.But as far as everything else goes, the acting was great, the decorated cast was commendable, and the plot line to the story is definitely a reality check to all those little rich kids who are never satisfied with their lives no matter how much they have, this movie shows them to appreciate what they have and to just be thankful that they're alive and don't have to deal with what people forced to live in the ghetto have to deal with, because these kids do think everything is a game and it's not.

The movie start with Alison(Hathaway) and her best friend Em(Philips) having a boring sex-o-drug party, continue with Alison and Em having a sex-o-thrilling party and finish with no party.The girls try to be so called modern day hippies but they succeed in finding boredom and fake behavior by their friends and families until they meet the Latino gangsta culture of east side L.A. which open their eyes for the real life.Unfortunately they find out that real life can be more shocking than a Christmas comedy.The GOOD: + Anne Hathaway is hot!!But she has the ""Angelina Syndrome"". I mean, soon her beauty face will be one step before her acting.But for now things are 50:50 and I can proudly say 2006 is Annie's year. +The nudity in the picture is beautiful and painful.Most of the realism is achieved by it. +It is very difficult to consume drugs, alcohol and sex.They can bring pain more oftenly than pleasure if you don't know how to use them correctly.Thanks for showing that. The BAD: -Very poor and unrealistic dialog.Who talks like this? Even the Latino gangsters are exaggerated. -The camera-guy is so annoying and unconvincing.C'mon now, a mature teenager teaching and talking about how lonely are the other teens. -Em's character is empty.And she should be Alison's second nature- irresponsible, high and having a family.Movie don't need her.All of that could be performed by Alison's character.The UGLY: *Joseph-gordon levit trying to be a high rastaman rapper. *The latinos.",Havoc
83,kstina5,It's surprising how many people don't get this,7,3 April 2007,"I know it isn't an epic indie movie that's going to gain a cult following, but some of the comments miss the mark. 'Havoc' is a movie about teenagers who are bored with their upper class white lives. They know the lives their parents have are meaningless so they look for meaning elsewhere. They create gangs and use drugs to be more like people they think are ""real"". The writing isn't all that great, and, yeah, the plot drags in places, but the message remains: these kids are trying to be ""real"" by being something they aren't. This point is hit again and again, but mostly in Allison's (Anne Hathaway) conversations with Eric (Matt O'Leary). All of the kids from the Pallisades are being fake, so blaming the actors is not the way to go. These characters are trying to be one-dimensional, it's all a performance. These young actors did an amazing job portraying how boredom leads to chaos. As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, he is so talented it hurts. Sam is a one-dimensional, wanna be gangsta who has burned away so many brain cells he can't function. But it was a strong choice made by Gordon-Levitt and he stuck with it until the end. Was he believable, no, but how many gangster white kids are? Blame the writing, the absurdity of seeing Anne Hathaway's nipples, or the lame plot, but don't blame actors for other people's mistakes.",Havoc
84,halloweenslayer,"Original, honest movie.",7,7 January 2006,"Havoc was a very truthful movie. For the subject matter, it was very well done. It could have been predictable and cheesy, but it wasn't. All the characters, whether I liked them or not, drew empathy. The acting was very good, and seeing Anne Hathaway do something like this puts her on a new level of maturity and talent. One could see teens actually behaving like the ones in this movie, but more, Havoc should make some kids (who pretend to be someone they're not) see themselves as others see them. Like idiots. Which is great. The only bad thing was that it the story seemed to lay blame on the parents for ""not being around"", which is sort of cliché. All in all, good movie.",Havoc
85,heinekee,"Pointless, ridiculous, and stupid",2,7 February 2007,"I have to admit I only watched the first half of this movie. The one thing that kept me past the first 10 minutes or so was the hot young girls and the creeping suspicion that this could be a comically bad movie. My hopes for some kind of decent, thought out, conceivable, thought-provoking plot rose when she (whatever the main characters name is-I have forgotten already) went back to the 'ghetto' with her friends. I found out it wasn't comically bad but pathetically so. Let's just say the only people who could possibly rate this movie more than a 3 are those who are as shallow, contrived, and clueless as most of the characters in this movie.I feel as though this movie tried to make some kind of social commentary but failed so miserably it left me wondering if maybe it wasn't a satire of a social commentary film. Don't waste your time unless you are a spoiled teenage girl and have no concept of the real world. If you fit that description, enjoy...if possible.The only thing that saved it from a 1 rating is Anne Hathaway's sexuality.",Havoc

But I was COMPLETELY wrong about this, this movie is anything but Princess Diaries. Basically, this movie is this close to being a porno. There is an extreme amount of nudity and a lot of depressing scenes. But I must say, if you look past the nudity, language, and horrible characters, this is a well directed and acted out movie. It's the only movie I've ever seen or even heard of that is brave enough to show a gang rape.

Thats why I give it a 5. Anne Hathaway has a nice rack.The comical portrayal of whiggers who ""represent"" the thug life of the Palisades, too weird not to be true. You know the writer hung out with these clowns in high school. So all in all, watch it for a good laugh at the expense of rich kids. It is not accurate, nor is it enthralling. It doesn't make you feel a connection to any of the characters, and the most interesting guy never gets the girl, the a**hat with daddy's credit card does, too cliché.",Havoc

Knowing that they have a safety net of Mommy & Daddy. These kids are just so bored they think that this is the life that they want. Is it the media? Music? Who to blame? Parents? Music? TV?My favorite line in the movie is when she is trying to join the gang and he says: We are trying to be like you, and you are trying to be like us...Do I recommend this movie to people?

They show that money can't buy brains, brawn or common sense. The ending was deliberately vague but we know something bad happened. They reminded me strongly of the 311 Boys here in Las Vegas. There are probably several others like them, they were just dumb enough to video tape their stupidity. I don't even want to get started on the little minds that commented that the girls deserved what happened to them. Abuse of women is totally unacceptable to me.

There was not a second of anything authentic in this movie, rather we were treated to a Hollywood hack writer's sad and pathetic attempt at garnering the attention and adulation of his peers.Every scene seemed to be calculated to gain a screen at Sundance and awards for the ""creative"" team. Of course, there was really no creativity in sight whatsoever.It's a sad portent of the state of current film-making that films like this one get made.It's heartening to see that this self-conscious attempt has completely failed. Hopefully more of those contrived attempts at ""reality"" will go the same way.As for Anne Hathaway, she was very disappointing. I was expecting her playing a different part, but she was still playing the ""princess"", except this time Hollywood's idea of a ""rich bad girl"". Her career will be very short if she keeps those bad choices coming.Also, the film also laid negative stereotypes about Latinos on thickly. Apparently, according to Steve Gaghan, all Latinos are gangsters and all White kids want to imitate them.If this is what Gaghan can do when he is not adapting someone else's work, here's to hoping they never make another of his original scripts.",Havoc

92,nikitakv,I was going to hate... but it's difficult in retrospect...,10,23 September 2009,"Let me tell you, after sitting through it, I was going to come here and totally trash it. I was going to call it an abomination of film making, etc. But luckily I decided to see what other people thought and find out a little more about the director/story. I really wasn't sure how to interpret it. I'm glad that I did that, because now I think I get it. This is one of those movies that comes so close to the truth, it should almost be taken as a documentary, rather than a feature film. There is no compelling plot, there is no hero, there is no big story/lesson. This movie reflects real life so well, that it completely fails to give you the feelings you expect a movie to give. Because real life, unlike a movie, is very slow, quiet and subtle. It's like a story you'd hear someone tell about someone else, and the ending, more likely than not, would be that in the end nothing happened, everyone went their separate ways. I would call this movie a valse between the themes of what is real, fake and reality. A lot of the people who give this movie a high rating sympathies with a Latino gang, because they perceive them as real. I think these people miss the point, because while the gang may seem more conscientious of their presence, or more in touch with reality, they are still pieces of crap. I mean, they're drug dealers who sell crack- cocaine! They're real alright, real and evil. And while the little white girl(s) who get(s) good grades and not enough lessons in reality from their parents, that is, why they live in a nice house and gated community, as opposed to say, a crack ghetto? Are just confused, scared, lonely and forced into these situations/realities. They're too naive, young and stupid to know better and with no strong parental involvement (the girl even has a line akin to that in the movie ""You're never here!"" she yells at her dad) it's not really their fault that they find themselves in these places.Like I said, I was going to give this film a bad rating and a bad review, but realizing just how deep and close it cuts to the truth of the matter, I'm going to give it the best rating there is on this system, because that is what I feel it deserves.",Havoc
93,pokeypup36,Um....,6,6 July 2016,"This is one of those odd movies that manages to leave you with the feeling of it was far too much while not being enough. The movie is average 5/10 but I have to give 6/10 because I can see the vision they were trying to achieve. It's important to remember the fact this didn't set out to be a joke, it wanted to make a statement, to reach something. It just fell short in every way. There were a lot of great ideas and somehow none worked out. With a near impressive cast everyone was again somehow under utilized. Rich kids wanting to be something they're not, buying into the life shown on TV. But it wanted to show more than that, show what it's like to be lost and hating yourself. Even in Hector, an idea highly under developed seemed to want something more and thus his brief emotional draw to her. Everything came out underdeveloped. One last note, I've read a lot of reviews wanting to see where people stood, call it procrastination from tasks awaiting me, but what I find crazy is how many people ignored/missed the whole lesbian deal. I mean to me, beyond Alison being someone who is lost and hating herself and life as well 99% of teens do....it seemed like it went for the internalized homophobia as well. On the stairs that was a ""real"" moment to her. She was ""jealous"" at points. Even in the sex/rape scene her hesitation was about Emily and big surprise she was into it until she looked over and saw Emily (at that point) having sex....This movie aimed high, aimed for rich VS poor, feeling lost, being a teenager, sexuality, who you are VS who you're supposed to be, not knowing who you are or what you want. Yet it all fell short. It's a shame because I think a movie like this when done properly could really leave a mark and resonate with society. SPOILER COMMENT BELOW:And it leaves you with no sense of closure. What happened in the end? To anyone. I think that her little video thing was a nice touch to end (if polished up) but again WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ANYONE??? Who died? Did anyone? Did her and Em make up? Did they stop talking? Did they get together and live happily ever after? Did Alison accept herself? I mean any answer after sitting through 1hr and 30min would have been accepted. This to me wasn't a matter of going for a ""real life"" moment where not everything is wrapped up perfectly (True Detective S1 did an amazing job of that) but poor execution or planning or both.",Havoc

Violence and Sex are a little bit to much appearing but seems to be justified with the storyShowed hard and heavy the difference between imagination and reality; dreams and errors are normally the right of young people but nevertheless you need to be careful if you 'play with fire'.It always can change the game (also called life) in a dramatic way. That's what the movie is about : without saying that's wrong or that'S right. especially the - more or less - open end (I am looking forward to see different end shootings on the DVD of this movie) clearly states out: It is everybody's own decision what to do or what better not to do.My summary (also for young people)is : Go and see this movie; you will not regret it !",Havoc

The acting is so laughable that you feel bad for the actors. Mike Vogel- no Joseph Gordon- Levitt are two great actors but i also imagine they were high during most of the production.

96,ZombieNightmare,Havoc was brilliant!!!,9,29 November 2005,"What an amazing film! This is right up there with ""Crash"" and ""Dot the I"" as one of the best written films of the year. I can't say enough about the performances. Anne Hathaway took on a very dangerous role and did an extraordinary job. I don't think Disney will be calling her anytime soon however. This will be a defining role in her career. This is one of those movies that take you from a range of emotions. At times it is thrilling and others absolutely heartbreaking. There were very tense moments and some erotic ones. Again that is a credit to the amazing performances by Bijou Philips and Hathaway. I don't know if I haver seen a better directed movie all year. Everything down to the music was dead on. My only issue with the film is that it never really ended. It just kind of left me hanging. Beside that this is one of the best films of the year and one not to be missed.",Havoc

The other being, the world from which these teens come from, rich neighborhoods and they are bored with life, thus they do what they do. They cuss, A lot, they do drugs and have sex, A lot, but for all of that, I felt that it all came across as rather interesting. Parts of the movie feel phony, however I believe that's the point. When these suburban teens, led by a rather convincing Anne Hathway, are all ""gangsta"", the whole thing seems, off, phony; when she (Anne's character), is 'herself' there are some tense moments of clarity, as if the movie wants to make it's point about just trying to fit in wherever you can.

98,bnolley,"Interesting look into the ""gangsta"" lifestyle of a group of teens",9,2 June 2006,"I rented this movie on the recommendation of my cousin. I was definitely glad that I had. It provides a glimpse into the lives of a group of rich and privileged teens who have adopted the ""gangsta"" lifestyle. I put gangsta in quotes because one of the main points of this movie is that they really have no clue about what is real and what it is really like being in a gang. The way that they dress, talk, and act is solely based on what they have seen in movies and on how they believe people in gangs act. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Sam is the best example of this skewed image. To some, his performance may seem over the top, but this is how Sam truly feels as though gang members act. This life that they have created for themselves is so artificial, so fake, that they can just switch it on and off. When they are around their parents, they are the perfect children that their parents want. But, at night, they drink, get into fights with rivals, and do drugs with their ""gang"". The main character, Allison, gets a taste of the real world when she goes downtown one day. There, she finds a world that she wants to fit into and become immersed in. But, she isn't ready to handle all of the things that come with that world - being arrested, sleeping with the gang, etc. She goes along with it all for a while, but her fantasy of the gang life is soon shattered. The performances in this movie are outstanding. I have only known Anne Hathaway from movies like The Princess Diaries and Ella Enchanted. Here, she shows amazing depth and range as an actress. And, Freddy Rodriguez brings so much to his role of Hector the crack dealer. I truly empathized with him. This is an excellent film that I would recommend to anyone with an open mind. Yes, it does have a bit of sex and nudity in it, but it is appropriate for this film. Check this one out!",Havoc

Makes me shudder just to think personally, because many of the characters really reminded me of people that I know. (Yes, that's sad, I agree.) The drinking and the drugs, a lot of that really happens with teenagers, I hate to tell all the concerned parents.

I admit i watched the entire thing only because i felt that if I turned it off i would miss some embarrassing moment. This movie failed to make the profound statement that it set out to. Anne Hathaway is definitely unleashed in this but fails to convince me that she has any real comment on the person she is portraying. A spoiled rich girl from Pacific Palisades goes slumming for excitement without ever realizing her purpose. This film reminds me of a saccharine version of ""Kids"". The semi-documentary story about teen drug use and debauchery set in NYC. Highly sexually charged, all Anne really has going is her obvious looks, but her acting falls very short.

After having survived previewing Black And White from several years ago (another ""urban"" flick starring Bijou Philips), it is possible that I should have learned a thing or two. I haven't and several weeks ago, found myself watching this celluloid train wreck that my room mate borrowed. For starters it was filled the usual clichés that constantly infects the collective Hollywood think about what goes on in suburban and urban worlds. Bored suburban kids trying to imitate televised MTV-type dysfunction. Urban kids being upset with their environment and using it as an excuse to resort to antisocial behavior. And somewhere in the intersection, we find some suburban teen that is startled yet attracted to the volatile side of inner-city life, and some inner-city ruffian fancying a bit of romp with preppy, sheltered beauties from the 'burbs. And just when this sort of premise is not enough to push you into oncoming traffic or committing hara-kiri with a rusty butter knife, Bijou Philips is tossed in for full measure. Hey this sounds familiar. Right, Black and White minus the gang bang and inevitable shoot out. The only bearable person in this entire movie was Anne Hathaway who seemingly kept this crap afloat. If the over-hyped Devil Wears Prada highlights Ms. Hathaway acting, me thinks this is the sort crap that will haunt her career. It shouldn't but she took the gig. Sorry dear. Needless to say, it was the waste of nearly two hours that could've been spent watching some other movie like Glitter. Yes, this movie made Glitter seem like a celluloid masterpiece. Now some folks are stumped about the ending. I'm not. Actually, I'm grateful to the directors for leaving that up to the imagination. Chances are, if they had just spelled it out, it probably would have screamed ""anti-climax"". And that is why they get a 2 and not a 1 rating. They spared me the agony and I'm grateful for that.

The film at first seems a little over dramatic, but when you think about it, it's really supposed to be. Anne Hathaway really does a great job as the pretty little rich girl who's willing to be anybody but herself, but although the character is interesting and portrayed very well doesn't mean much unless you put that character into the right situation. Allison is a really interesting, unique, and just good character, but she didn't belong in this plot. I don't know where she belonged, but it wasn't in this movie.

Now, Anne was a bad choice for the lead because she does look a little old for the role, but other than that, it was a good film. Let me tell you why, if I may. I grew up in the hood. Not what little preppy white kids consider the hood, but the actual hood. I am talking about drive-bys, gang wars, drug dealers on the corners and at every bus stop. It might bother people, but this was an accurate portrayal of the ghetto. This showed the stereotype of suburban white youth. No, not all white kids are whiggers with attitudes that they can't back up. Just like not all Latinos are rock dealers. But, please you must recognize that this is showing stereotypes and nothing more. Remember, we wouldn't have stereotypes if there wasn't a lot of truth behind it. White kids, especially affluent ones, are fountains of cynicism. They have no direction in life. Therefore, a great many of them turn into what this film shows. Latinos, those from areas like my own, often do gang up and its very common for them to sell rock and reef. Its not racism, and its not an attack on a culture, its the truth, painful as it might be.

It is the same all the way through. Some stupid, spoiled, white girl wants to be different and see the world in a different way and upset her parents.At first I was surprised to see nudity from Miss Disney but she lost her Disney contract after this movie and at the first tit shot. The acting was horrible all the way through for all the actors. I was laughing at the gangsters because they were rolling around on the bike acting tough. I was waiting for the bell to ring.The worst part that probably shows the most truth is when a girl rolled dice and came up with 3 to sleep with 3 guys and was willing to do it to join a Mexican gang. (A white girl in a Mexican gang? Stick out like a sore thumb comes to mind.) Then when all the guys get on top of her to do their thing, she freaks out and says they raped her! When you are willing and say, ""ok to sex"", it is not rape, it is sex. Once again, we have stupid, spoiled white girls trying to get their way by lying and running home to rich mommy and daddy.Then when Anne Hathaway is starting to sleep with a guy to join a gang, she freaks out and he lets her go. Whatever, he would rape you because you disrespected him.I can't believe that anyone who read the script once thought in their mind that this would be a good movie and a hit.If there really are white boys acting like that in school in LA, they would be shot. Look in the mirror and know what color you are and act that. If you have money, don't be a slut or a gangster. If you are white, don't join a Mexican gang, or better yet, stay in school and don't join a gang! I guess the only good part was when the white boys got shot or something because it went black and we have to use our imagination to fill in the blanks. If I want to use my imagination, I will read a book.

I've seen other reviews, and they all mentioned how stupid it is to watch this movie just to see Anne naked. But I have absolutely opposite opinion on that. She is really worth more than 10 points to watch. A huge mismatch between her image as a star in children's movie and her very mature body revealed in this movie creates a new kind of eroticism that makes you hold your breadth for a while.The storyline is weak and the acting is really bad.

I had never heard of it before watching it, and once I found out that that ""the girl from Princess Diaries"" was in it, I really almost turned it off. BUT, the opening scene with all the white kids ""chillin"" outside at night acting all ""ghetto"" with all their rappin' and slang talk really caught my attention. I guess I could relate because I lived in an upper-class, predominately white area, and trust me, those characters are not a far stretch from real life. Yea some of the stereotypes of characters were extremely overdone and artificial, and the thought of two random white girls getting in good with a gang highly respected in ""the hood"" is totally unrealistic, but I think that's what the creators of the movie wanted to express. How ridiculous, and superficial their lifestyle was. And if you get caught up in it, you better be prepared for the consequences--or else! You have to look at it in a positive way...Anne Hathaway blew me away (since I could only remember her from that annoying predictable princess diaries movie...eeww!). I think it was something that really showed her range as an actress and I applaud her for her willingness to explore new roles. I'm excited to see what roles she chooses to do in the future! Oh yea, and I also enjoyed watching Bijou Phillips...her face is so mysterious & alluring...",Havoc
109,jdabbott51,A total loss,1,12 August 2006,"Wow, I don't know where to begin with this one. It was really all just a big awful project that tried so hard to make some sort of social point and just left you with nothing but a sense of total loss at the end. No point made, no plot resolved, and more than anything it just didn't seem engaging or even accurate in representing the youth. I'm really just making this comment to drag down the average rating because the overall user rating is ridiculously high.First off, if your intelligent enough to watch this movie as if it were a referendum on social commentary then you'll be disappointed at the silliness of the actors who are trying to portray white kids who mimic and emulate hip hop culture. They literally appear like a bunch of clowns as even the clothes and gold chains and the form in which they try and break out in rapping at a party is completely exaggerated.Second, the portrayal of Hispanics as purely malicious and drug dealing in East LA is absolutely 100% bogus (this is a huge foul on the part of the movie). Every part of any town has it's tough parts, but East LA has been a bastion and practically a renaissance of Hispanic culture in the US. Freddie Rodriguez is a fine actor and he played his entire character in Six Feet Under as way to combat this stereotype. Yet sadly he just dives into his stereotype as if it never existed.Third, the movie takes an overplayed approach of setting itself with the ""nerd kid"" who serves as both conscious and filmmaker making some form of muddy documentary on god knows what and all of these tough gangster wannabe kids accept his constant presence wholeheartedly -no matter how 'tough' they are.In the end nothing is learned. The white rich gang bangers with their illusion of being hardcore is still idiotic and they're all still illusionary. The malevolent cholos are just being malevolent cholos.There's almost an identical movie that was made by Robert Downey Jr. which was even more twisted because he was the nerd making the documentary and the white rich kids were even more pathetic. And then there was even a cameo appearance with Mike Tyson that made the whole thing surreal. I can't remember the name of the movie. I usually remember the name of movies I like. Okay, I think you get the point.Anne Hathaway really tried to enter into new waters with this film. Unfortunately she nearly drowned and had to be carried back to shore by a lifeguard. Perhaps she's trying to combat her typecast of Princess Diaries. I'll be fair and say that for me she has certainly broke this typecast, but I can't imagine this film will help her get any more respectable roles in the future if not hinder such a chance. I really think this is a shame because the potential for her to be a really astounding actress is there.Final thought; there are a lot of white rich kids who try to act black. Perhaps so many directors in Hollywood are watching their children become hoodlums and spending all their money on baggy clothes and rap Cd's because their seems to be some endless attempt in the movie industry to try and rationalize this phenomenon. In reality it is nothing more and nothing less than pure ignorance and charades. Stop torturing us please.",Havoc

These ""Wiggas"" of the Palisades are such posers you'll be rolling your eyes at each of the ""shocking"" moments. Ironic, that Director Barbara Kopple comes from the documentary world because nearly every scene in this film plays against realism and believability.Also, where are the black people that the white kids are clearly aping? Apparently only Latinos are gangsters in this parallel universe. The only saving grace: Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips are smokingly hot. Other than that, just.... no...",Havoc
111,boxerup,Here's the facts.....,10,5 December 2006,"First, I saw the movie and read the boards. Those of you who hated it are living in denial of this really happening everyday. The writer is telling it like it is. Rich kids getting board and looking for excitement and attention. They go south into what they see as the ghetto. In reality it is a working class neighborhood. Race does come into play only because the rich kids are so lost they are trying on different ""charactors"" in real life. If you paid attention you would have gotten this from the young film maker in the movie. The guys from the ""16th"" street gang resented the rich kids coming down there and flashing their wealth in their faces. Basically you have all that and don't appreciate anything theory. These guys all have to work everyday to not only support themselves and their families, but to stay alive. These rich kids were there waving their wealth in their faces and looking for a thrill. (the Mercedes) They got their thrill and then cried. Before you all get angry, I never said Emily deserved what she got. She put herself in that place, started it and then when it got out of hand, cried rape to her parents for the attention she was craving all along. The guys in the room should have stopped, but Emily should have never been there. The movie went into places most of us don't want to know exist. But the truth is there. The movie is real and the actors did a great job at bringing the reality into your face.",Havoc
112,barbarailene,Well done with some flaws,9,21 September 2006,"Positive aspects: Well shot with pretty good script. The kids appear vulnerable under a tacky veneer of their ghetto talk. There are a few scenes when they lapse into just being white kids (""They know we're nervous,"" says Emily finding herself in East L.A.). This usually happens during moments where they're unsure of themselves. This is a very real human response. Sometimes their actions and tough talk seem extreme. While this very well might be perceived as bad acting towards many a viewer, I believe it to be exaggerating to make a point about the way really really rich bored kids might act. Kids at that age CAN be really really stupid, acting like something they're not. Although Ann Hathaway's character seems unlikely, one must throw caution to the wind and accept her for a highly intelligent con-man(girl), that causes to put herself in a dangerous situation. Emily on the other hand is the complete opposite, stupid and silly. But, the real loser is the boyfriend, Toby, who's costume is embarrassing at the least. This heightens the gap between the real gangs versus the department store variety which is an editorial all it's own. Rich imitating poor out of sheer uncreativity and ignorance. I also really liked the music. And if I haven't already said it, yes, I think the acting was good and Ann did extremely well considering the circumstances. Negative aspects: The first scene should have been cut. It just doesn't make sense, rich girls joining their boyfriends in the parking lot for a brawl against some local gang. This scene is almost a deal breaker since you have to wait a bit to warm up to this movie as it could easily be mistaken for the usual coming of age party movie. When Allison takes Toby to the car I saw her change from excited highschool hottie to someone who seemed numb from the same old sex to a pro who gave the best bj's around. This is when I knew something was happening with this movie. The other hard to swallow scene was Allison as porn queen in her house with her film buddy. However, I feel something like this only enhanced the perception of Allison thinking she is in control which is a set up for when things unravel. I think those involved took risks in the making of this film. I was stimulated throughout. I wanted to commit suicide while watching The Devil Wears Prada. So, there.......",Havoc
113,bcwilsonms,I'll Never Look at the Princess in the Same Light...,5,6 January 2007,"the acting was suspect, and the plot was full of holes. However I will support any movie that features a hot DP scene. Let's be honest though, if this movie was realistic, the first time these cats rolled into East LA, Toby would have peed himself right before getting a cap busted in his head, and Allison would have then been gang banged in some random gutter. Just calling a spade a spade here. And for all for all you birds out there who are trying to say Hector is hot, does that mean you are into the drug dealing rapist type? If so, I guess this explains my recent struggles with the females. I mean I understand broads like the bad boys, but let's be real. If Hector is the type of guy girls are looking for, I am looking at a long and lonely life ahead of me. This was a terrible movie, but I somehow can't keep my mind off it. Plus, it was only about 75 minutes long. At least they had the decency not to stretch this out into the two hour zone. So I guess I'll give it a five.",Havoc

This movie made a valid point about the teen epidemic of ""thrill seeking behavior."" The teenagers in this movie are rich but bored, emotionally neglected and looking for something in life that has some meaning. Some say the movie is pointless because none of it could ever happen. I don't think the exact context of this movie would happen but teenage experimentation with hard drugs, multiple sexual partners and alcohol are all very real. I would recommend this movie highly to teenagers (with parental guidance) because the wrong behaviors of the teens in this movie come with consequences (which is a rarity in movies) and to parents because they can be so very blind to what is really going on in their children's lives.",Havoc
118,SwollHottie,Depends on what you're looking for,5,12 December 2005,"I'll be honest. The only reason I picked up the movie at Blockbuster was because Anne Hathaway is attractive. Read the back and it somewhat piqued my interests, mainly because of who created it. Movie really wasn't anything to call home about. Acting was less than stellar and cinematography wasn't great...I expected more. Only plus I saw was that, as a 23 year old male, Anne Hathaway showed a little skin. This movie seemed to show promise throughout, but it never delivered. When it seemed like a corner was gonna be turned and there would be a ""change"" among a lead character it fell flat.

Incredibly gratifying to see wiggers and wannabes get mixed in with the real deal. The shallow parents and the shallow teens are fairly true to life, if you're familiar with the Palisades.The film isn't necessarily about teaching lessons or any after school special for sure, Anne Hathaway is not all T n A in this movie like someone else commented, if that's all you remember then you've got problems. Don't get me wrong, there are lessons that can be learned through the character's experience, however it isn't the focus.

I think everyone who says Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway acted horribly, did not understand the characters at all, the reality is that their characters acted terribly, and so Gordon-Levitt and Hathaway's performances were actually amazing, in the fact that they could portray teenagers with such skewed ideas of reality. From a previous comment that I agree with: ""Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Sam is the best example of this skewed image. To some, his performance may seem over the top, but this is how Sam truly feels as though gang members act.""

121,Kotski,A Pleasant Surprise: Give it a Chance,8,14 January 2006,"So this film is filled with sex, expletives, and at times over-the-top portrayals of young people in Los Angeles. Now to say something you might not have know: the films is a real pleasant surprise! The acting, specifically by Hathaway and Rodriguez, is very good and the story (two girls lost in a world of rich nothingness try to find their reality), though nothing revolutionary, is very enjoyable and engaging. Hathaway shows the constant personality changes of her character, Allison, with acute conviction while Rodriguez, too, plays his part spot-on. Though sporadically parts of the screenplay border on cliché, the film overall doesn't strive to be deeper than it is, and, in the end, tells a very good story.",Havoc
122,corgibrat,"horrible excuse for a movie, makes you feel like youve been mentally raped",1,26 March 2004,"This movie is pitiful.  The story line flops, there is no real story line that is believeable.  The actors, while generally good actors, are made to look like fools in this movie, and they only add to the fakeness of the movie.The language that is used is ridiculous, if it is not immature cursing it is slang that is not believe coming from the mouth of a ex-princess(hathaway) or looks like a joke coming from an alien(gordan-levitt)On the topic of the actors cast, the majority of them are good actors, that I had enjoyed watching previously.  However after subjecting myself to Havoc, I hold little to no respect to any of these young actors and actresses, mainly Hathaway.  They placed themselves in a movie that made them look like jokes.  Where they pranced around acting like ""gangstas"" talking like fools, and showing more nudity then one would see in a porno.Aside from the unrealistic story line, laughable script,and pathetic actors, the movie as I mentioned above, follows the lines of a porno.  I have never seen so much female nudity, and sex scenes.  What boggles me most is that there is so much nudity of what your supposed to believe to be underage kids.  The most horrible scene that makes you sick to your stomach is Phillips getting initiated into a mexican gang, shows her, quite visually, having sex with two men at once.  Everything else in the movie seems to follow that same vulgar line.I can not justly suggest this movie to anyone.  I saw it because it was free screening, I wish I hadn't.",Havoc
123,clumsypiper,"Oh, post-modern world",5,4 January 2006,"After reading the comments for this movie, I had a strong urge to see it. To be honest, it seemed like a bit of a pot boiler, though I was surprised when I found out it was penned by the same writer that gave us Syriana and Traffic. What I really liked about this film was what lied beneath its surface, even if that seed wasn't brought to fruition for a number of reasons. What I thought the film truly attempted to explore was the membrane between cultures that has become permeable in today's media-saturated environment, or more specifically, the access granted to those with the means to appropriate what has become a stylized version of ghetto culture. It is one of the more fascinating reversals in contemporary culture made possible only by the media explosion : the cultural performance of a sort of ""ghetto aesthetic"" by white suburban youth, whose participation in that aesthetic is one of choice, rather than of necessity, as it could possibly be said is true of those who must actually navigate the ghetto. I appreciate the effort on the part of Gaghan to explore this cultural phenomenon, but unfortunately, he and his collaborators fell short of their endeavor in more than one area.For one, and I imagine many would agree, the choice of Anne Hathaway as the lead was particularly disastrous, and not because of her association to more wholesome films, but because she simply did not have the capacity as an actress to perform this role. Secondly, the performance of the PLC actors was fairly laughable, though the blame must be placed on the scriptwriters for this one. The characters switched too freely from their ""thug"" personae to their ""authentic"" (if that word is appropriate) suburban personae. The filmmakers truly cut their own feet out from under them and missed the point: white teenagers immersed in this sort of cultural performance are usually far more invested in their own individual performances, and thus, would not be likely to slip so freely between identities. That they were able to do so betrayed the fact that the teenagers were aware that they were in fact performing, rendering the characters unbelievable and blunting the point of the film. But the film's true failure was in its mind-boggling refusal to prioritize the subject matter above the personal struggle of the protagonist, which comes off as pretty flimsy. If the filmmakers really wanted to explore the interplay between cultures and the consequences of that interaction as the result of our media-saturated environment, there really should not have relied on such an antiquated notion of a central protagonist. It's just not that kind of movie (or shouldn't have been). Gaghan did a stunning job of elevating his subject-matter in Traffic and Syriana, which leaves me with the sinking sensation that there might have been some studio intervention on this one. In the end, Havoc is stifled by the centrality of Allison's moral dilemma. What is far more interesting is the implications of this threshold - both figurative and literal - that has been opened in contemporary American society. Havoc's endeavor is a bold one in exploring a sojourn between cultures not just in a circumscribed sense wherein suburban teens take part in a cultural performance within the confines of their own environment mediated by digital medium, but in a real world scenario. The most poignant moments occur within this awkward zone of interaction, and much of the praise can be placed on Johnny Vasquez: the scene where he explains that East Los Angeles is a place where ""people live,"" rather than a vacuum of nightly news reported crime. Perhaps the most searing line occurs after the contentious ""rape"" scene in which Manuel asks Allison, ""What did you want?"", alerting her that this experience is not within the locus of control usually allotted her as the result of her white privilege. An ""authentic"" experience is inherently alien to her, and experiencing the alien is rarely comforting. Such interaction carries the weight of victimization for both parties - Allison and Emily for whom the sexual taboos are too great a hurtle to jump, and Manuel, who suffers the consequences of Emily's attempt to grasp at some sense of control and to cover up the shame that she feels following the sexual interlude. This double victimization is something that is overlooked in the was-it or was-it-not arguments over the sex scene, which is unfortunate, because the point of the film, although poorly articulated, can be found in the aftermath of that scene.",Havoc
124,gebrebcfc,brilliant just too short,10,29 January 2013,"as a fan of Disney films,animated and live action or films along those lines,these type of films barely get a look in from me.the only reason these indie sort of films ever get a look in is because i buy all dvds/blurays of actors/actresses i like,in this case its obviously Anne Hathaway.of course this is a huge leap from playing a innocent little princess but i think this is the only reason so many people have given this a negative review.i would say if you want a bad Anne Hathaway movie then watch passengers.havoc is easily her best film to date,as good as princess diaries was,there is similar films out there and while ill always buy them all and enjoy them all its nice to see something different once in a while and this is as different as it gets.the nudity is not just added for the sake of it,instead it is a story in itself and the only downside was how it ended,its far too short for the amount of story there was to tell.every single one of the main characters had at least one or 2 more story points to finish on,it seemed like it was just getting into the film and it ended but it shows how good a film it was if the only bad side is that it leaves viewers wanting more.there easily could have been a sequel and the first time i watched this the very first thing i did was go online to see if a sequel was coming because i really wanted to know what happened to Alison and if she made friends with her friend who was raped,and the main bit missing is who was killed at the end,i don't understand the point of finishing a film with audio only so you cant see the main part of the film,the whole story led up to a gang fight and that very fight was just a blank screen and a random gun shot then credits roll.but overall its a great movie and worth watching if only to see Anne Hathaway in yet another brilliant film and up there with the high budget blockbusters",Havoc

Phillips and Freddy Rodriguez were the stand out talent. Watching Rodriguez, Hector, just bring such depth to a gangster character without being over the top or offensive was worth seeing. He is an actor's actor! he will knock you out with his acting muscle. Although this film surrounds the lives of teenagers it is in no way, shape or form a teeny-bopper movie. It is a movie that displays the problems with having everything but whats really important, like the real love of a family. In the film Allison will go so far as to sleep with a gang member, as an initiation, to be a part of this gang..this family. She is desperate for the feeling of family. Sound more cliché than it is.

126,cridafer,Two hours I can never get back.,1,20 January 2006,"Words cannot express how much I hated this movie. I hated every aspect of it, from the direction to the writing to the acting. Havoc is the story of one teenager's (Anne Hathaway) exploration of a world outside that which she is accustomed. And that's putting it in a way that gives this movie more credit than it deserves. Hathaway's character is part of a ""gang"" of white, upper-class high-schoolers who backlash at their upbringing by emulated black culture. She and her friends eventually decide to take a trip to East L.A., and no hilarity ensues.I decided to watch this movie for two reasons: Stephen Gaghan had a hand in it; and Anne Hathaway, who I have always found enjoyable to watch, was starring in it.I'll begin my criticism with the writing. After finally viewing the movie, I can honestly say that I found nothing that resembles Stephen Gaghan in the script. Vapid is the only word I can think of to describe the thoughts and ideas of this movie. It is one of the those movies that tries so hard to make a social comment, yet fails so miserably. The characters are all one-dimensional, especially Toby (Mike Vogel), the wigger boyfriend of Hathaway's character Allison. His actions are so broad and exaggerated, I had a hard time taking anything he, or anyone on screen at the time, did seriously. Finally, each character was written to be an example of a stereotype. I almost laughed when Hector (Freddy Rodriguez) tried to explain that not everything in East L.A. was about gangs and drugs, then proceeded to fill every stereotype of a movie gang member. Each and every actor in this movie lost points in my book for being associated with this film. Even those I like and respect. Michael Biehn, Laura San Giacomo, Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips all have done serious, believable roles. Even Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose only respectable role I've seen him in was ""10 Things I Hate About You"" (I haven't seen ""Manic"" as of this writing), in which he was at least believable. Here, his unbelievable overacting reaches a point at which Paris Hilton would be proud. This brings me to the directing. Because I respect many of the leads and they have done great work in the past, I can only blame the awful choices on the director. Very few movies reach the depths this movie does. I have not hated a movie so much since ""The Doom Generation."" Stay away if you can.",Havoc
127,ciyana1,great low key movie,10,27 October 2006,"I don't normally right reviews for films, but i'm going to make an exception on this one. I never heard much about this film and usually these type of film never catch my eye as they are not advertised as well as the big blockbusters, however I tend to enjoy them a lot more than those movie which are thrown down my throat. With critics ranting and raving about how good they are, when in actually fact they are a piece of crap. This movie was very interesting because it shows young rich kids trying, to escape their privileged lives and act like something that their not. Even quoting lyrics from famous hip hop songs and using the word ""Nigg@"" freely, and not taking in the fact that they might offend someone. This type of movie make me think why people would want to change who they are? why can't the be happy with them selves and their lives? I have come to realise that if someone wants to change who they are, they must have some self esteem issues and the pursuit of them changing everything that they are will not make them happy but more than likely send them on the same path of unhappiness, they need to love them selves as they are and not try to be someone else. I am not saying that people should not embrace the cultures of other communities, but If you don't really associating with that community and are only going by the stereotype of how that community is perceived by the media. Surely not ever one who listens to hip hop, goes around talking the way those kids talk, I find this odd because It seem like they, have never associated with people outside of 'thier crew'.As a black person I know this as I enjoy embracing my culture, but I know their is a time and a place for everything and like Anne's character I adapt my language, to suit the person I am speaking too, because if I speak creole to a middle aged white person they probably wouldn't understand me. The same statement goes for a African person, but a fellow Caribbean person would understand me. However the fact that Anne and he ""plc"" crew don't come from that background and more than likely only just got into the whole hip hop culture, speaks volumes to me and I just don't understand why they feel the need to talk the way they do, as they have not grown up around it.I really enjoyed this film, it make you wonder why people feel the need to join gangs, do drugs, play with guns and want to be someone else. Is it to escape the reality of their home lives? But why choose to do things that are so negative? Why not do good? why not help folks who are not as well off as your self, get out the life their in. why not volunteer your services to make a difference?OK enough of my ranting, you should watch this thought provoking movie.

I can agree w/the previous review that the ""F"" words' use was overly excessive in the first 5 minutes and that I would have problems watching Anne Hathaway in a another movie. All I know is that movie completely irritated me, if the plot is how it was depicted. I'm not sure what the movie was trying to show. Was it trying to show that their lifestyle was great or just how STUPID they were? And yes, while I was watching it I was offended and embarrassed by ALL their actions of cheap, completely brainless and unrealistic attitudes/reasons for their actions. After the movie the teenagers (ages 14-19yrs) that saw it laughed and said they could have done a better movie and went on to describe more stupid/cheap ideas(What is this a contest?). What's really depressing is if teenagers are really this this way... How sad for the future. So if the events were close to truth of teenagers today then it would be a good movie that will completely depress a realistic person or entertain the morons that they depicted in the movie.",Havoc
129,Epithy,"A Social Commentary, If You Look At It",8,7 November 2005,"Watching this movie, the first thing that came to mind was, ""Wow, these kids sure are fake."" In many initial reviews, this movie was derided as being a joke. It was either hearing about the various nude scenes of Anne Hathaway or a bunch of white kids trying to act black, and doing it poorly.I said that that ""fake"" was the first thing that came to mind, because we are immediately presented with this group of rich white kids acting like they are black. However, it is being mistaken by some reviewers that these actors are doing a bad job. What we are really seeing is truly how superficial that these kids are. They are fake, in every sense of the word, and that is the whole point of the movie. Don't try and act like something you aren't because there are consequences.I say this is a social commentary, not perfectly executed, but still fairly well done nonetheless. It does truly present many aspects of youth behavior nowadays that most people don't really look at. We are given a true side to high school, where there are fake people everywhere, underage and illegal activity is happening, and its all going on without parents there to see. This movie takes the comedy out of the teenage life that has been prevalent in movies over the past 8 years or so such as American Pie and other similar styled teen comedies and turns it to a sort of opposite view. Now I am not by any means saying that this movie is a guiding light which everyone should see. In fact, I don't know if this movie is for everyone, because of the issues it presents. Some people, especially parents, would undoubtedly have problems coming to terms that the behavior seen in this movie happens. Now it doesn't happen everywhere, or in every school, but I'm pretty sure that you know what I mean.I think this movie, is backed up by pretty well performed acting done by the majority of its cast. Anne Hathaway, who many doubted had the range to tackle such a role, seemed very natural in the part. I don't mean that negatively, and I actually give her credit for really becoming the character. The rest of the cast does a good job, but it is her performance that truly helps you understand most of the underlying message of the movie.I know that some will not see in this movie what I saw, but to each their own. I do hope that people see this movie and don't criticize it solely on what they think is bad acting.

All of them are living double lives, wanting to be something they are not. But what they all find out later is that they really have no idea what they want.This is a great and very tragic film. It is not a waste of time, but you might not understand it very well if you haven't been through the same type of things as the characters in this movie.Life is ridiculous and so are the characters in this movie. Tragically ridiculous.",Havoc
131,CovinS,"much like ""Closer""",6,29 November 2005,"The film ""Closer"" (2004) was never meant to be liked, just revealing. I felt the same vibe resonate throughout the eighty-six minutes of Havoc. It's not at all meant to be a film you'll necessarily respect, favor, prefer, or like--the film is simply meant to show you the stupidity of the rap/gang culture. The emptiness, the lack of emotion and integrity that is showcased throughout the generation. A previous review stated that all the actors were terrible in this film, that there was no plot, and virtually nothing in the movie in the first place. I agree to an extent; there is no plot in the lifestyle, no purpose. However, I believe the actors actually gave surprising performances, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt the most convincing; I didn't even recognize him for a moment. The filming was well done with a few gag-me exceptions; most angles were appropriate for the scenes (though the sexual situations *definitely* could have used a little more imagination).Overall, there could have been more to the film than what we're left with. This could be attributed to the death of the original screenwriter in 2003, or it could be the director's execution. However, I still stand by my opinion that it's worth watching, but that you probably won't desire to see it again.",Havoc
132,fltboy16,not a rebel without a cause,7,1 November 2007,"I agree with some of the posters that this movie was a little cliché, uneventful at times, and a little difficult to watch- I almost turned it off at more then one point. But i am glad i stuck with it.Some have called this a ""rebel without a cause"" movie, teenagers against the social norm. But it is more about over-privileged white teens looking for a way to fit in somewhere because they lack a connection to their own society and the reckless choices teens can make to find social acceptance. It also portrays those choices as a lack of family influence.As for the East LA residents being ""sterile"", i feel the commenter may have been looking for a very negative stereotype about Hispanic neighborhoods. What you saw in the movie is fairly accurate- family oriented communities, hard working people, and a level of friendliness and camaraderie rooted in a shared heritage, as well as the darker side borne of a rougher life. The time Allison spent with Hector walking East LA and seeing that there is more to the community than drugs was really a well done and vital portion of the movie.The over-the-top acting on the ""wiggers"", it can be seen any day in a person or persons trying to hard to be part of something else, whether is blowing slang out of proportion or thinking they can use a word that ""belongs"" to another culture.They movie was not excellent though it was a good take on the genre. you almost feel a connection to these kids as they explore who they really are and they learn that there are unfortunate boundaries based on skin and class and the consequences of crossing those boundaries.",Havoc

What this film does so well is show the attraction of ""being a victim"" be it privileged suburban male teenagers mimicking fashion and language of poor minorities or their female counterparts longing for acceptance from rapper-wannabes and drug dealers. The attraction of being a victim is the prevailed mentality in the film and in the minds of many young people today. One can only speculate as to why this is so appealing to youngsters. Perhaps the confusion and intimidation of the world through young eyes makes being perceived as a victim is an excuse to express anger, hostility, and failure as well as to hide fear.",Havoc
136,audacious21,It wasn't a bad movie.....It just wasn't a good movie though,4,1 August 2006,First let me say I'm a teenager and I understand the movie very well. It shows some fabrication of the truth and though it wasn't a bad fabrication and the cast was great it just didn't flow. Some people in the movie are great like Joseph Gordon-Levit who always gives a great performance and even Anne Hathaway's performance was decent the script didn't flow. It was all over the place and some people were just too whiny (Bijou Philips). They really didn't need to have all of those shorter girls with the 5'9 Anne Hathaway because she looks very out of place.The music and the way the film was shot were however probably the best aspects of the movie. But some of the scenes were just all over the place and it didn't make sense. Like someone in the editing room got the scenes mixed up. The point is that even though most of the cast were pretty good and the artistic way the film was shot and the way they missed the music and camera angles were incredible that script was not ready.,Havoc

About the Anne: In my opinion the main character was played well.

We are the same age, and I can easily recall doing stupid sh*& myself as a teenager. How many of us can honestly say that we aren't lucky to be alive...teens tend to think they are invincible. Seeing a ""princess"" turned teenage tease was slightly disturbing (ms. Anne Hathaway) but she definitely showed versatility as an actress. Yes, this movie was full of language, and gratuitous sex scenes, but if nothing else it was honest about the things that young people get themselves into in the quest for finding their own identities. I think this memorial movie would definitely make the writer proud...good job to all involved.",Havoc
139,Ballntsl420,The Truth,7,2 December 2005,What first caught my attention to this movie while i was browsing movies to rent was the plot. After the movie i was more than just satisfied. I felt like i got a taste of what it is really like in the ghetto. People need to understand that this stuff is going on in our country. Most people shy away from it. I believe a lot of kids can relate to this movie in finding out who they really are. Maybe they are letting there ego take over who they really are which in my opinion happened in the movie. Did she really want to live a life of fear and rush. The movie kept me gusseing over and over again. I was interested on what was going to happen next from start to finish. I hardly ever got bored of what was being shown on the TV. It shows very well for what its like to live a rich Hollywood life to a hard knock life of dealing drugs and acting tuff. If they didn't live in those conditions would any of them act that way? Ask yourself that. Overall i thought the movie was about a 7 1/2 maybe an 8. Training Day still tops my list.,Havoc
140,tmouffe,Different,9,4 December 2005,"I knew nothing about this movie and it made it better that way. It is intense (the unrated version for sure). Throughout the whole movie I found myself able to relate to different characters. Not personally, but because they seemed real. The best part of the movie was how real it was and how different it was. It is by no means a light hearted movie however, so be prepared to have to focus and not to laugh. This is not a good party or group movie.I was impressed by the actors. I recognized a lot of them and could never have pictured them in such a serious movie. Each played their part well. Anne Hathaway was incredible. I have seen Princess Diaries and this movie showed me her true range as an actor. The other characters were also played very well. This helped add to the realistic effect of the movie as a whole. The ending may leave you in question but I thought it was beautifully done.",Havoc
141,pat20327,"Havoc, a waste of time, money, and 92 minutes of my life",1,8 December 2005,"As described by Webster's.com havoc n : violent and needless disturbanceThis movie matches that almost exactly. It was definitely a disturbance in my life, and the violence came at the end, when me and my 3 co-workers took the DVD out of the player, and threw it across the room.First, I have to say, that the kids portrayed in this movie were total and utter idiots. The rich white ""gangsta's"" as they liked to be called reminded me so much B-rad in malibu's most wanted it was pathetic. I seriously wanted to punch all of them in the face. I mean come on, the kid from third rock from the son was portrayed as a white gangster pimp... when we all know hes far from it. He had the high pitched voice and everything, I'm surprised he didn't keep one of his hands in a glove filled with lotion in this movie. The main characters boyfriend was just a pathetic character, and if you've ever seen the movie ""I'm gonna get you sucka"", hes basically a white version of the guy who O.G's... this rich white kid trys to wear all his ""bling"" and its just overkill.Anyway besides the horrible main characters, the ONLY believable and semi-realistic people in this movie were the sixteenth street gang, and they were still portrayed pathetically. In one scene in the movie, after the 2 girls roll the dice... and are spending some time alone in a hotel room with the gang members... one of the girls politely screams for the 3 men who are with her to stop... and they do. I'm sorry, in any gang initiation, stop is not an option.The movies plot was awful... some rich kids try to get in with some thugs in east L.A... and they fit right in and were accepted... nope sorry, that doesn't happen... then some bad things happen to one girl, and it was all her fault, and her ""gangsta"" rich white friends (basically the crew from malibu's most wanted) get angry and raid a Mexican baby house... then the movie ends, it was awesome.Don't waste your time with this pile'o'junk, go play in the highway, you'll feel better afterwords than if you were to watch this movie.",Havoc
142,epac-2,Dumb flick,2,21 April 2006,"Just what we need...another movie showing how bored rich and beautiful teens get because mommy and daddy aren't around (probably screwing the neighbors) and giving them the attention they sub-consciously crave. Sorry, but this movie is about as UN-realistic as it gets. The girls are typical cheerleader-types, just looking to score drugs and their male counterparts are dumb jocks, engaging in gangsta-wannabe fantasies, posing with firearms they have no idea how to handle. The High School Elite of Americaour future!!! Throw in the obligatory teen-sex-lesbian scene and a Latino gang for street-credibility and you have one half-a**ed excuse for a film. I mean, who could possibly care about these characters??? It's ""Closer"" all over again! The one decent kid in the film is the nerdy-type filming everyone, but he never remains on screen long enough to gauge any depthonly that he seems to be the only one with a brain. Which speaks to the problem with movies in generalno one (in the viewing public that is) wants to watch anything real, only rich and beautiful fantasy-land junk. So that's what we get.For a more realistic portrayal of teenagers (i.e. - not the beautiful people), see ""13"" or Gus Van Zant's ""Elephant"".",Havoc
143,danpurvis518,Horrible.,1,26 December 2005,"My wife and I are huge fans of Anne Hathaway and were excited to see her step into a different role other than her previous Disney roles. As much as we remember her in those movies for doing so well, we will remember her in this movie not for the acting, but because she chose such a bad movie to expand her experiences. Havoc is easily in my top three worst movies ever seen and is probably fighting hard for number 1. Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. The plot for this movie is horrible. This movie represents a studio advertising Anne Hathaway's nudity and making money off of it while putting a horrible plot and other actors/actresses around her. Don't misread this, I am not against nudity at all, but there wasn't anything else in this movie that made it worth watching. Don't waste your time watching this movie because it will only leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. I hope that Anne Hathaway continues to make good movies but is more cautious in the movies/roles she chooses in the future. There is a reason why this movie was ""straight to video.""",Havoc

In that fashion this movie is not a coming of age story, nor is it very realistic.The Wigger character types are laughable in my area none of these wackos exist so the director was a bit of the mark. Even if he made the story more realistic it still wouldn't matter as the characters don't amount to much. I know some nerds rented the movie to see Allison nude but seriously you losers need to get a life. Her nude is crappy as well and doesn't even last a full a minute. What a ripoff.

145,comeonslackers,I thought it was really good.,10,5 January 2006,I thought it was an excellent movie. But that was my preference. You will have to see it for yourselves to know whether you like it or not. But for me it was something I would definitely watch again. It is not a movie for kids below the age of eleven. But the older kids would be fine. In my opinion. But some parents would like to watch it before they let their kids watch it. There is some nudity in it but it has a good massage about staying away from drugs and the life of drugs. So it has a really good story line to it. And it also lets parents know what a lot of their kids are going through. At that particuler age. And in highschool. Highschool can be very destructive to kids.

It reminded me of the crap comedy 'Malibu's Most Wanted'. (At least MMW was a p*ss-take of these sorts of kids, rather than trying to be serious.)This film is not entertainment.Watch it once, but no more (that is if you can bear the annoyance of the little, rich, immature, 'gansta-rap-imitating' punks).People who rated this film highly need to grow-up, get real and get a life.

If you want to see a film that can have the impact that this one wants to have, watch the Catherine Hardwicke film ""Thirteen"". Anne Hathaway's performance is good, but not good enough to save this film from being as mediocre as it is. It was however refreshing to see an actor like Michael Biehn in this film. He is a fine actor and I do wish that he would open up to some films like this. The genre for this film is a little tired and exhausted to hastily create another one about ""spoiled kids who want to live on the dangerous side of life"".

They seem to live life in a dream state without consequences for their actions. We see that there are consequences for their actions, but I won't say any more about that to avoid the spoiler thing.The fact that the end is never really resolved shows how it doesn't really matter who wins this ""battle"", the damage has already been done and the boyfriends' unwarranted vigilantism demonstrates again with how little gravity they take serious situations and their lives even.Havoc is a movie with graphic content, but with a deeper message that is very interesting and had me and my friends talking for a while.

149,eric-whiting,Havoc did Anne no favours,4,13 April 2006,"It has been said that Anne had to mature and move on, well simply taking off her clothes is not the answer, if it were the case then any young porn actress would have to be considered as a mature actress. It has been the case for a long time that any beautiful young actress that makes a name for herself early in her career, is then expected to play a nude roll, mostly just once in usually a naff film, and these are quickly forgotten. Julie Andrews SOB for instance. Anne's involvement in Havoc has lost her the respect shown to her by Garry Marshal and Tommy O'Havers, and other actors, as it was reported that after Brokeback Mountain was shown at the film festival Anne was left on her own at the party afterwards. Anne has confirmed that Ang Lee had never heard of her and thought she was just starting out, Anne unfortunately did not enlighten him, hence the selection of disjointed scenes Blond hair and discoloured teeth, and for all the hype and awards the only recognition Anne received was for her nude scene. TDWP which is to be released later this year also contains a nude scene according to a review posted after it was shown at the festival, the reviewer stated""the shocker came when Anne revealed her breasts"" which dose suggest that it was not expected and just another unnecessary exposure. Ang Lee stated when interviewed at an award ceremony that his main hope when making BM was that the film would break even and they would get their money back, presumably putting in a couple of nude scenes was an attempt to put more bums on seats. One can only hope that in Becoming Jane Anne manages to keep her clothes on, surely three films where she is exposed is enough, Anne is far too good an Actress to be treated like this, perhaps Becoming Jane will gain her the respect she once had, both from Directors and the public. Her next film Knocked up might suggest more of the same. Update Anne has dropped out of Knocked up and the part will now be played by Katherine Heigl.",Havoc
150,ben-h-79,this was an excellent movie,10,2 March 2006,"I will now address a issue some people have brought up . Allison played wonderfully I might add by Anne Hathaway who also starred in (princess diaries) was a daring character, looking for excitement in what she believed was a boring pointless existence. I've heard people complain that the character was shallow. What are you complaining about? This character was supposed to be shallow, that's the whole point. Allison doesn't know who she is, and addresses this issue by trying to be everything to every one, seemingly intelligent and kind to her parents, a strong streetwise leader to her friends, and the perfect sexual fantasy to men. The movie arcs when Allison believes she has found someone who is ""real"" a Hispanic gang leader in East L.A.. Allison becomes entranced with this alternative way of life which she feels connected to, but has never really experienced. As the story progresses trouble naturally ensues. All the actors in this film did a great job, but it was Anne Hathaway who was the most impressive, showing a rare talent for being every one and no one at the same time. In the end Alison is a little wiser than she was in the beginning. The crew of this film has shown and told us an excellent story of personal growth.",Havoc

If they wanted to tell a realistic story, then all the white girls from the nice town would have been raped the first night they were at the party with the gangsters. They also would have been beaten severely by the females in the gang. Those girls were not only from another town but they were very naive no matter how ""cool"" they thought they were. Unfortunately, real gangs are a hundred fold more brutal than this weak movie portrays them.Even if the girls would have lasted long enough, or even been considered, for ""initiation"", Allison's request to not go through with it would have been met with a beating followed by a gang-bang ,pardon the pun, (i.e., in reality the two guys would never have let up on that girl no matter how much she cried). It is not a pleasant subject at all, but it is the harsh truth about how outsiders are treated in this bu11$h1+ gang world. These portions of the film stood out to me the most for being extremely inaccurate although that could be said about almost any part where the suburban and inner-city people are coexisting together.So for those of you who are not gang affiliated don't be a faker and stop trying to act ""gangsta"". It's stupid and people who are in gangs will only use you. This movie is a fantasyland for people who have no idea.As for the bad acting in the film. It didn't make it any easier to swallow the stupid, unfounded plot. The fact that both the white kids and the Chicano MEN (not kids), didn't convince anyone of their authenticity of character only added to how far off this movie is. The white girls seemed to act like any other bubbleheaded teens only more slutty than most. I thought Anne Hathaway was gonna be a huge star, but if she keeps going down this road, she'll HAVE to strip to get paid. The gangsters did a great job of looking the part but they would have been more convincing if they had kept their mouths closed. They didn't seem ignorant enough to be real. The whiteboyz were just so ridiculous it proved a point that I'm not sure the movie was trying to prove. No one else had a significant enough role. Overall just bad acting because of some stupid writing.I will agree with dacb80's (You ever get drunk...., 2 March 2006) comments about this movie being so booty that it's gonna be funny to smoke a bowl, watch this again and really laugh my ass off.

I'm definitely going to recommend this movie to all my friends. It's too bad that a lot of people won't get the opportunity to watch this great movie. I feel lucky to have found it at the video store because before I saw it there I'd never even heard of it before.

153,kaitar14,Watch it more than once then judge.,5,26 March 2006,"I was flipping through the movie channels one night and saw a topless woman and said she looks familiar. I hit the info button on my remote and saw the name ""Anne Hathaway"". I looked at her again and said ""Oh my gosh that is the girl from those princess movies"" (Ella Enchanted, Princess Diaries 1+2). Maybe that is the only role she could find, or maybe she is trying to reshape her image, either way Hollywood got another young actress to strip. I had to watch this movie twice to get past the shock of seeing Anne naked and cursing.The first time I saw this movie, I thought the movie was a little weak. The white teens who put on that hip hop image were not funny but more annoying. The movie also did not portray the Latin-American gang members in Los Angeles, although I though that Hector was one of the few people in that movie with their head on straight. Also, the movie just left me out to dry, it did not conclude well in my opinion. And if they went to East L.A. where were the Black people? One part I did like in the movie was when Allison went back to Hector's house and he told her exactly what she needed to hear. ""I know everything about you. Yeah, I can see right through you. Everything to you is a f**g game. You ain't real. There's nothing real about you. Your talk ain't real, Your walk ain't real, the way you dress ain't real. You don't even copy it from the real thing, you f***g get it from the TV."" After you look past all of the nudity, sex, and drugs, you see a movie with some pressing issues. Havoc show what happens when you do not spend enough time with your children when they are young. The reason why Allison was so absorbed and interested in the hip hop culture is probably because she was raised by MTV. The kid with the camera doing the documentary, also relatively level-headed, stated that Allison is ""the loneliest person he has ever met"". I agree with him seeing as how her parents don't even know her.This movie makes you hate rich White kids. They have everything us average Joes could ask for, security both financial and from crime. Young White kids, especially those in the suburbs and rich areas like in the movie, need to realize that even though they are bored and the ""gangster lifestyle"" may seem like fun the fact of the matter is the ghetto is not fun and should not be glamorized by anyone.I gave this movie a 5 because even though this movie at the most is semi-powerful, it needs to be seen by those young kids who are living the lifestyle that these kids were living in the movie Havoc.",Havoc
