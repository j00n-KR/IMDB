0,MartinHafer,"The acting certainly was very, very good.",7,31 May 2012,"WARNING: This is an intensely depressing film and should not be seen by kids or the severely depressed. Additionally, if you just can't handle an unrelentingly dark and somber film, then you might want to look further.""The Hours"" is a very unusual film in that there completely separate but parallel stories that are interwoven throughout. While ""Julie and Julia"" did this with two, ""The Hours"" manages to do it with the lives of three women--three very, very, very depressed women who are suffering in silence.I loved reading Claudio Carvalho's review. While short, it really summed up the film very well when ""The Hours"" was called 'A depressive and boring movie with outstanding cast'. I couldn't have said it any better. While there are three dynamite performances by three top actresses (one of which earned the Best Actress Oscar for this film), the film itself is all about depression and is a bit slow. Despite this, the writing IS good--and weaves together the disparate stories in a very unusual manner that is quite clever. So, it's a film I can respect but certainly didn't enjoy. After all, three ladies who have parallel stories who are fixated on suicide--this isn't exactly a comedy!! I see this film as one that is worth seeing for the performances and I can respect the way the film was constructed...but I just felt disconnected from the characters and didn't like the film. Well done but very inaccessible for most viewers--including me. If you are severely depressed, I sure DON'T recommend you watch it--it might just send you over the edge. Also, it's really NOT a film for kids...so think twice about having them watch it.",The Hours
1,TheLittleSongbird,Absolutely stunning,9,22 June 2010,"The novel is quite complex, and I think The Hours did a very worthy job of adapting it. One or two of the scenarios could have been more weighty and perhaps less clichéd and the pacing is occasionally a little slow, but overall The Hours is a stunning film, very elegant and beautiful. Not only that, it is a very poignant exploration of longing, desire and regret, conveying the lives of three women from three different eras.The Hours looks exquisite- the film has amazing costumes, settings, cinematography and scenery. Even more impressive are the beautiful haunting score, magnificent screenplay, compelling story and strong direction. Not only that, the performances are marvellous. Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances here, she is virtually unrecognisable as writer Virginia Woolf, the most developed and compelling character of the film. But Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep are also fantastic as the stifled 1950s housewife and the present-day lesbian book editor.Overall, stunning film, where the pros well and truly compensate for the minor cons. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Hours
2,bkoganbing,"""Some Of Us Die So The Rest Of Us Can Appreciate Life""",9,15 March 2010,"The Hours is a triple tracked story about three women of different time periods all of whom have to grapple with the idea of suicide. Don't blink while watching this or you may miss a moment of great acting in someone's look or voice inflection.All of the women are influenced by novelist Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, all are reading the book at the time the moment of life crisis comes to them. Who would be more influenced by the book than its author Virginia Woolf played here by Nicole Kidman. Her story of suicide is well known and maybe she did reexamine her own writings in Mrs. Dalloway.The other two stories are from 1951 Los Angeles and 2001 New York. In Los Angeles Julianne Moore seemingly the perfect suburban housewife feels trapped, especially in those times of forced conformity. She's married to your typical suburban dad in John C. Reilly and has one kid and one on the way. But she's reading Mrs. Dalloway and questioning herself.The modern story in New York involves literary agent Meryl Streep who is taking care of an ex-husband who now has AIDS and is in the final stages. Streep is a lesbian and ex-husband Ed Harris is a gay man. But back in the day people, in fact in all three days, people felt a need to conform to societal norms. It was of course strongest in Virginia Woolf's time in the United Kingdom between the two World Wars. Streep and Harris served as each other's 'beards' even marrying because only now are same gender couples fighting for that right.At first when I was watching The Hours I thought that maybe it should have just served as a three part film with individual stories. But the reason the film unfolds as it does with the cross-cutting between time and plots will be made clear at the end.The Hours was up for a flock of Academy Awards including Best Picture, but it only won in one category, Best Actress for Nicole Kidman. Her portrayal of Virginia Woolf is an exercise in restraint and intelligence, her psychosis is very subtly suggested. Some might have chosen to chew the scenery, but in Nicole's case less turned out to be very much more.Ed Harris was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Julianne Moore for Best Supporting Actress. Moore's appearance in that category was strictly to increase the chance that she or Kidman would win and it worked. But truth be told the three women all have about equal screen time. Harris is unforgettable as a dying man with the AIDS related dementia, questioning all around him including his continued existence.The Hours is restrained, literate, and wonderful and gives lie to the fact that great screen roles for women just aren't being written.",The Hours
3,Prismark10,Three women,8,29 June 2014,"A film that spans generations in the lives of three women and there are links between them especially with themes of mental illness and suicide and as the film progresses you will gather that two of the segments has a stronger bond with each other.Director Stephen Daldry brings a sure touch these three stories as the plot focuses on these women of different generations whose lives are interconnected ostensibly by the novel Mrs Dalloway by Virginia WoolfClarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is a New Yorker organising a party for her close friend who has won an award for his poetry and is suffering from AIDS (Ed Harris). This story is set in 2001.Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a pregnant 1950s housewife in California, unhappily married she is desperately trying to bake a birthday cake and then leaves her young boy behind as she goes off to a hotel to commit suicide.In 1920s England we have the tale of Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) stricken with depression whilst trying to write her novel as her husband desperately tries to support her and yet is at loss. Knowing so little about the book Mrs Dalloway some of the links past me by but the acting especially by Julianne Moore and the films three stories itself were enthralling. I kind of guessed the importance of Ed Harris's character and its interesting to view that both Moore and Kidman's story had a lesbian subtext set in a time where this would had been more taboo whereas in Streep's segment she is an open lesbian.The film is very moving in parts and Daldry directs a very accomplished picture.",The Hours
4,claudio_carvalho,A Depressive and Boring Movie With Outstanding Cast,8,3 November 2003,"Three stories run in parallel in this movie: the Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman)'s story, from 1923 to her suicide in 1941, in England. The story of Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951, in Los Angeles, when she tries to suicide. And the Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep)´s story in 2001, in New York, where her best friend and former lover Richard Brown (Ed Harris) commits suicide. First of all, this is one of the most depressive movies I have ever seen. The problem is, there is no explanation for such attitude of the characters. Virgina Woolf was a maniac-depressive woman and we can understand. Richard Brown has Aids and we can also understand. But why Laura Brown, the trigger of the 2001 drama, is in such depression, having a home, a husband that loves her, a health boy and being pregnant? I do not know whether this flaw is from the director or from the screenwriter, but it is amazing. Maybe in the book this reason is clear, but good movies are those, which the viewer does not need to read the book to understand it. The music of the great Phillip Glass is also very monotonous and boring and fits well to this film. However, the cast has an outstanding performance and it is difficult to highlight only one of them. My vote is eight for the performance of the actors and actresses.",The Hours
5,lee_eisenberg,Stretched from end to end.,7,2 March 2006,"""The Hours"" is not the easiest movie to describe. It portrays three women affected by Virginia Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"". The first is Woolf herself (Nicole Kidman) in the 1920's, slowly but surely descending into madness. The second is 1950's housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), beginning to feel unfulfilled with the suburban lifestyle. The third is present-day Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), contemplating the future.This is an interesting movie, although it certainly is a downer. Moore's role is particularly interesting, since she played almost exactly the same kind of character in ""Far from Heaven"", released around the same time. Also starring are Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, Claire Danes, and Jeff Daniels. Certainly worth seeing.",The Hours
6,jboothmillard,The Hours,7,8 September 2005,"I remember that I watched this film once before, and I agreed that the leading actress deserved the Oscar she won, but I definitely needed to see it again to properly understand it, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Reader). Basically, this film sees the life of three women all suffering from depression and their lives changing in the space of one day, and they all share a near connection besides this. Virginia Woolf (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Nicole Kidman), living in 1923 England, who would later in life commit suicide by drowning herself in the River Ouse, is in the middle of writing her latest novel Mrs. Dalloway, and she is trying to cope with her sister Vanessa Bell (Miranda Richardson) and her children visiting, and deciding whether to stay with her husband Leonard (Stephen Dillane) despite knowing she is a lesbian, or run away to London where doctors tell her not go to. Laura Brown (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Julianne Moore), living in 1951 Los Angeles, is reading the novel Mrs. Dalloway, and she is stuck in a loveless marriage with husband Dan (John C. Reilly), who is celebrating his birthday on this day, and she is letting their young son Richie (Jack Rovello) help make the cake. Laura has found out her neighbour Kitty (Toni Collette) is going to hospital to have something bad looked at, but mostly she has to cope with being pregnant with a baby that she may not want to have with her husband, and she must decide whether to stay in misery or run away. Clarissa Vaughan (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep), living in 2001 New York, is a career publisher, and she is making plans for her poet friend Richard Vaughn (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ed Harris), who is dying of AIDS and nicknames her ""Mrs. Dalloway"", to attend a party for him to accept an award. Despite also being lesbian Clarissa wonders whether she does love Richard, and they once dated, and she seems to be spending too much time trying to do stuff for him and hardly anything for herself in her personal life, even with daughter Julia (Claire Danes) visiting. All three plots come together by the end to be concluded, Richard confesses to staying alive for Clarissa before throwing himself out the window, we find out he was the son of a now old Laura, she tells that her husband and the daughter she had are dead, and Virginia does finish the novel, but ultimately after trying to see herself through it does give up on life. Also starring George Loftus as Quentin Bell, Jeff Daniels as Louis Waters, American Beauty's Allison Janney as Sally Lester and Psychoville's Eileen Atkins as Barbara in Flower Shop. Kidman is virtually unrecognisable as Woolf with that big prosthetic nose, her good English accent and her sympathetic attitude to life, Moore is also fantastic as the 50's mother who is miserable and wanting to escape from her boring and uneventful life, and Streep as always gives a stern and determined performance, the supporting cast like Harris and Collette also give great performances. It is a clever concept to see the writer of the novel, the reader of the novel and the real life character from the novel all in the same story merged together, all three stories are compelling in their own ways, it is a sophisticated and emotional drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Music, Original Score for Philip Glass, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film, it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Nicole Kidman number 21 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Streep was also number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",The Hours
7,michaelRokeefe,Life is what you make it.,3,19 January 2004,"Well acted and literate drama. Downside: pretty damn boring. Three stories running at the same time are connected via the Virginia Woolf novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Woolf(Nicole Kidman)a British novelist and essayist; a 50s homemaker(Julianne Moore)and a modern-day book editor(Meryl Streep)dissatisfied with life struggle with such things as depression, suicide, AIDS and lesbianism. The fact that Kidman received the best actress Oscar for her role does not make this movie any more than it is...dark, dull and full of despair. A very good supporting cast features: Ed Harris, Jeff Daniels, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Dillane. More of a disappointment than a ""must see"".",The Hours
8,sunwarrior13,It Tells Three Stories,9,27 September 2012,"The Hours is a drama film starring Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Ed Harris. The screenplay by David Hare is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title by Michael Cunningham.Toni Collette, Miranda Richardson, Allison Janney, and Claire Danes co-stars.It was directed by Stephen Daldry.Three women, separated by a span of nearly 80 years, find themselves weathering similar crises. In 1923, Virginia Woolf is attempting to start work on her novel Mrs. Dalloway, in which she chronicles one day in the life of a troubled woman. But Virginia has demons of her own, and she struggles to overcome the depression and suicidal impulses that have followed her throughout her life, as her husband Leonard ineffectually tries to help. In 1951, Laura Brown is a housewife living in suburban Los Angeles, where she looks after her son Richie and husband Dan.Laura is also an avid reader who is currently making her way through Mrs. Dalloway. The farther she gets into the novel, the more Laura discovers that it reflects a dissatisfaction she feels in her own life, and she finds herself pondering the notion of leaving her life behind. Finally, in 2000, Clarissa Vaughn is a literary editor who is caring for Richard Brown,a former boyfriend and noted author, who is slowly losing his fight with AIDS. Clarissa is trying to arrange a party to celebrate the fact that Richard has won a prestigious literary award, but is getting little help from Richard's ex-lover, Louis. As she labors to help Richard through another day, he wonders if his life is worth the unending struggle. Delicate and hypnotic, it interweaves three stories with remarkable skill.It actually improves on Cunningham's novel.Credit that to the gorgeous cinematography, a deft script by playwright David Hare and a mournful, melodious but never intrusive score by Philip Glass and a superb cast.It is a thought provoking film despite the fact that it doesn't really manage to entertain that much.",The Hours
9,jotix100,Three Women,10,10 January 2003,"The Hours is a great achievement for all of the people involved in this project. Credit must go to the director, Stephen Daldry, who pulls all the elements together. Having admired the text where this film is based, I wondered what would any writer do with Michael Cunningham's book where three lives of three different eras intermingle with one another. David Hare treatment of the material rings true to the novel in which it's based.The biggest revelation in the film is Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf. I have been a great admirer of this, up to now, underrated Australian actress, right from her beginnings down under. Her approach to the role is very subdued, perhaps underplaying, where someone else might try to have gone over the top stressing Virginia's madness. All the praise Ms Kidman has received for this film is certainly well deserved. The other great performance is Julianne Moore. This actress keeps getting better and better with any new appearance on the screen. Her Laura Brown is a pathetic figure. She's a desperate soul trapped in the Los Angeles suburbia of the 40s. She has a man, who obviously loves her. She has a son who shows all the signs, even then, of what he might ultimately become in life. Laura wants to end it all. She just doesn't belong in that world of domestic bliss. Ms Moore gets the right tone in playing Laura. There's not a wrong movement in her approach to this demanding role.
The third outstanding portrayal is Meryl Streep's. The sure hand of the director is obviously behind her reining the excesses she likes so well. This Clarissa Vaughan is in limbo in her own life. Her relationship with the younger lover is clearly over, or at least seen better days. Ms Streep gives a dignified reading of this character.The rest of the cast is brilliant: Miranda Richardson, Tony Colette, Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, and little Jack Rovello. They are all on the mark.",The Hours
10,preppy-3,"Too long, too quiet, too dull and no point",3,19 February 2003,"Three stories are told: Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1925 writing ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and how she deals with mental problems; Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951 Los Angeles--she's reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and is having to deal with an adorable son and loving husband; Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) in 2001 NY planning a party for a friend (Ed Harris) dying of AIDS and her rocky relationship with her lesbian lover (Allison Janney). The point of all these stories? Easy...to win Miramax more Oscars.This movie is coldly calculated to win awards. Everything looks perfect and completely thought out--there's nothing in here to offend anybody--all the acting is done very quietly and heavy on the emotion and screaming, ""Look! We're acting!"". The movie also moves very slowly and is very quiet--it's basically a very self-righteous film. All the acting was excellent--especially Streep, Moore and Jack Rovello as Moore's young son--but I could always see they were acting to win. I hated this film.There's no reason and only the slightest connection between the three stories and the slow pace wore through my patience very quickly. I dozed off at one point! Some people walked out on the movie--I wish I had joined them. Also the movies VERY depressing.Cold, calculated, depressing, slow--a perfect Oscar winner. Miramax has done it again!To be avoided at all costs.",The Hours
11,grantss,"OK, but not great",6,9 January 2015,"OK, but not great. Takes a while to get going, is filled with superficial melodrama and ultimately isn't overly profound. Still, the Meryl Streep-Ed Harris storyline is quite moving, and makes the movie worth watching.I am not a Nicole Kidman fan, and this movie didn't change that. I always found her characters so prissy and pretentious, and this was no exception. She certainly didn't deserve her Best Actress Oscar (though there wasn't much competition in the 2003 Oscar year). Ed Harris and Julianne Moore got Supporting Actor/Actress nominations for their performances, and Harris' nomination was well deserved (he lost out to Chris Cooper, in Adaptation). Meryl Streep should have at least gotten a nomination for her performance.",The Hours
12,evanston_dad,Stunning Film; Why All the Hate?,10,3 October 2005,"I'm really amazed by all of the spiteful, vitriolic insults hurled at this film from other users. Why all the anger? If you don't like the movie because you think it's boring, or because you think nothing happens, or whatever, fine...but there are reviewers who are actually dismissing it because it's ""feminist tripe"" and because all of the characters are ""queer."" I also saw the word ""dyke"" used. Sadly, these people are only helping to make the film's point.It's funny that people hate this movie for the reason that nothing happens, because I feel that SO much happens. Maybe not in a traditional Hollywood narrative sense, but this isn't a traditional Hollywood narrative, and God bless it for that. It's hard to get your mind around a discussion of ""The Hours,"" because it's about so much. It's about women and women's roles, it's about making choices and regretting those choices, it's about taking control of your life when others have become complacent in theirs, it's about the power of art to change lives, it's about taking care of the people in your life. And reviewers are saying it's about NOTHING? I have to believe that the users who hate this movie the most live the kinds of lives the women in this movie are struggling to fight their ways out of: dull, complacent, bland, satisfied with banalities. These people don't get why Laura Brown might be revolted by the antiseptic sameness of a Los Angeles suburb, where her day consists of making cakes and being bored. She's whiny, they'll say. She has no right to complain because her life's so easy, they'll say. Easy to say indeed when you yourself are living a life constructed for you by the mainstream and haven't once in your life challenged a social norm. I personally know a woman who lives a life very similar to Laura Brown's, and she's suicidal, literally. She loves her little boy, but she's suffocated by a life so lacking in stimulation that there's nothing to get her out of bed every day. And she's not an unfeeling monster.""The Hours"" is a beautiful film that gets everything right, and just may be the best book to screen adaptation I've ever seen. Maybe it would be more difficult to understand if you haven't read the book first---I'll concede that. But I think the movie is virtually flawless as is, and it frustrates me to read comments by so many people who have a total lack of sympathy for characters struggling with their own emotions. Just because you can't understand the emotions at play doesn't mean the work is at fault--try turning an introspective eye on yourself and see how far you get.Kudos to all of the reviewers here who have seen and praised this film. We can take comfort in the fact that there are still film makers out there who are willing to challenge and exhilarate us.Grade: A+",The Hours
13,ferguson-6,Not as depressing as many would have you believe,7,29 January 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Many describe this as a depressing, downer of a movie, but I beg to differ.  This is a clever 3-intertwined story film that is a classic study of the feeling and fear of loneliness. Truly remarkable cast with 3 stellar lead females and wonderful work from numerous others.  Special note for the performances of Toni Collette (""The Sixth Sense""), the always wonderful Claire Danes, Eileen Atkins (""Gosford Park"") and young, bright-eyed Jack Rovello.  John C. Riley gives another nice turn as Julianne Moore's perfect homelife/dreamer husband.  Did think Ed Harris was a little over the top, but Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson, and Jeff Daniels add to class of this picture.  Director Stephen Daldry does a respectable job with this inordinate amount of talent and terrific screenplay.  Nicole Kidman does a good job of capturing the pain of Virginia Woolfe, but Meryl Streep's story line seems to dominate the film.

Reilly: As indicated through dialogue by Ed Harris, the title represents those moments we either cherish or fail to realize. He uses the term, ""paint"" to describe those emotions. Flawed by its view of death with no mention of hope concluding upon grim notions that we are here to suffer. Virginia Woolf is played by Nicole Kidman in 1923 and isolated after two unsuccessful suicides. She longs for a life without madness. Julianne Moore plays a depressed mother and housewife in 1951 whose behavior affects her son in devastating matters. Meryl Streep plays a lesbian planning a party for the Ed Harris character but her very efforts are causing her life to cave in around her. John C. Reilly plays Moore's husband in the middle part of this three stage screenplay. Powerfully observed by director Stephen Daldry who is backed by a powerhouse cast. The three principal actresses are very good but the screenplay is quite depressing. We witness a suicide as these characters spiral downward into depression. What works is a rich cast and fitting production and makeup. Sound dialogue suggest staying alive for others. Perhaps we all should encourage one another as we go through our daily lives in hopes that we may make it through the hours. Score: 8 / 10",The Hours

16,JamesHitchcock,Kidman Wins by a Nose,8,19 August 2010,"""The Hours"" is, like ""Babel"" and ""Crash"", an example of what has become known as ""hyperlink cinema"", a type of film-making which has become increasingly popular over the last decade and which attempts to tell several different, but interconnected, stories within one film. Here the link between the film's three different stories is provided by Virginia Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". This book describes a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a London society hostess, as she prepares for a party. Each story within the film likewise describes a single day in the life of a woman from three different historical periods in three different cities. In the London of 1923, Virginia Woolf herself struggles with depression while trying write her novel. In 1951, Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown is reading that same book. And in the New York of 2001 Clarissa Vaughan is also preparing for a party.The stories are linked by more than the Dalloway connection. All three deal with the themes of depression, mental illness and suicide, as well as that of homosexuality. Virginia Woolf did of course commit suicide by drowning herself in the River Ouse in 1941, an event depicted in the opening and closing scenes of the film, but had unsuccessfully attempted to kill herself earlier, and this is referred to here. She was known to be bisexual and famously had a lesbian relationship with (among others) her fellow-writer Vita Sackville-West, although her sexuality is not dwelt on in the film.Laura finds herself in a similar position to Virginia. She may, indeed, have taken to reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"" out of fellow-feeling with its author. Both women enjoy an affluent lifestyle and both have a loving and supportive husband. Yet Laura too is troubled by depression and feels trapped in her home. She too is considering suicide. The film hints that the cause of Laura's unhappiness may be suppressed lesbian feelings; when her neighbour Kitty pays her a visit, Laura kisses her passionately on the lips. Clarissa Vaughan is quite openly lesbian, living with her partner Sally. In the novel Clarissa Dalloway has a close friend named Sally and Woolf implies that there may be some sexual attraction between them, although in the 1920s she could not be too explicit about this. Clarissa Vaughan is hosting a party in honour of her close friend Richard, a successful poet and author. Richard, however, who is gay, is suffering from AIDS, and is also depressed and suicidal. (In the course of the film it is revealed that Richard is the son of Laura and her husband Dan). Another link between the three stories is cooking; Clarissa is cooking for the party, Laura bakes a birthday cake for Dan, Virginia gives instructions to her servants to prepare a meal as her sister Vanessa will be visiting in the afternoon. The three sections are subtly distinguished visually. The New York scenes are set in winter and dominated by a cold, harsh light; the predominant tones are greys, blues and dull browns. The London scenes, set in summer, are warmer; the green of the vegetation is an important colour here. The Los Angeles scenes seem to be bathed in a golden light, perhaps symbolic of the nostalgia with which the 1950s are sometimes viewed but at odds with the reality of Laura's unhappy existence. This was the film for which Nicole Kidman won a ""Best Actress"" Oscar for her portrayal of Woolf, although I felt she was not the best thing about the movie. Nicole bears no resemblance to the real Virginia Woolf, so the decision was taken to give her a large prosthetic nose. There seemed to be a belief in the early 2000s that a physically attractive actress will not be taken seriously in her profession unless she has made at least one film in which she plays a physically unattractive character. (See also Charlize Theron in ""Monster"", Salma Hayek in ""Frida"" and Kate Winslet in ""Enigma""). In this case, however, I found the false nose a distraction, and it did not even succeed in making her look like Woolf, who was by no means unattractive. It did, however, provide the media with a source of puns of the ""Kidman wins by a nose"" variety. Nicole's nose could perhaps have won the ""worst makeup"" Oscar, but the rest of her body is fine and this is one of her best performances, on a par with the likes of ""Flirting"", ""The Others"", ""Cold Mountain"" and ""Australia"". I felt, nevertheless, that there were other contributions which were equally good or better, from Julianne Moore as Laura, from Meryl Streep as Clarissa and from Ed Harris as the tormented Richard. Moore and Harris were both nominated unsuccessfully for Oscars, but Streep was not nominated at all; possibly the reason is that, on the surface at least, Clarissa is more mentally stable than the other three characters, which means that Streep's performance had to be quieter and less showy than the others. That does not, however, make it less effective. Another important contribution comes from composer Philip Glass whose driving, agitated score for piano and orchestra seems to reflect the state of mind of the film's characters. A film about suicide and mental illness could easily have become morbid, but ""The Hours"" escapes this fate, partly because of some fine acting but also because the theme is handled sensitively by director Stephen Daldry and writer David Hare. What could have been depressing instead becomes a compassionate, if at times harrowing, look at people struggling to survive under difficult circumstances. 8/10",The Hours

And Virginia Woolf herself played by Kidman, in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness whilst trying to write her novel.Women-Centric films have always caught my attention. The empowerment of this SEX in the adapted screenplay is executed with flourish. David Hare has done complete justice to the screenplay.Stephen Daldry is a genius. Converting a fine Novel into a Film, is a big, big, challenge and Daldry executes each scene with remarkable understanding. 'The Hours' is undoubtedly, Daldry's finest work to date.Now to the performances! Each and Every Actor shines in this all-starrer. Julianne Moore is like never before. She gets the most difficult character among all the other characters, and shines the brightest as well. Her performance in one word - legendary. Nicole Kidman is terrific, no doubts on that! But, it's even her complete make-up that helps her get into the skin the character. Meryl Streep, as always, is effective. Ed Harris proves his caliber as an actor, yet again! He appears only in 2-scenes, but he remains with you throughout, and even, after the show has concluded. Jeff Daniels in a cameo, is superb. Stephen Dillane as Kidman's husband, is very good. John C. Reilly is decent.On the whole, A Must See Film! Amongst the Best Films of the early 2000's, or maybe, or all-times! Two Big Thumbs Up!",The Hours
18,=G=,Novel,7,28 June 2003,"""The Hours"", embellished with all the trappings of high end studio  movies, provides a forum for a fine cast to ply their craft and little more. The good critical reviews and box office the film received probably has more to do with hype and star power than quality storytelling or film making. Stagey, theatrical, ponderous, plaintive to a fault, and annoyingly vague, ""The Hours"" squeezes three stories into one thereby diluting each for the sake of novelty. Okay for hanky wringers. (B)Note - Those who want to see a real Oscar worthy best actress  performance should check out Diane Lane in ""Unfaithful"". Kidman in ""The Hours"" pales by comparison.",The Hours
19,OllieSuave-007,Hours of nice drama work.,7,28 March 2014,"This is a nice piece of drama based on author Virginia Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" where actresses Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep star as three women from three different generations. Their lives are thoroughly depicted in which the center topic is dealing with suicide, and all living a dark secret.Set in the 1940s, 1950s and the 2000s, each actress portrayed their respective roles brilliantly, capturing the atmosphere and social elements of that time. The make-up was realistic and done well, from Nicole Kidman's prosthetic nose to make her look like Virginia Woolf to Julianne Moore's elderly character in one of the stories.Each woman's lives were portrayed as seemingly wonderful and happy, but deep down, they have a secret or desire that threatens to put a cloud of depression and sadness over them and those around them. This might leave you understand the suffering the women go through and have you think about the emotions and events in your own life - how you could better handle them. Some viewers, though, might question the attempt of ""feminism"" messages this movie tries to put out.Overall, it's a pretty good piece of drama, nonetheless - riveting and mesmerizing.Grade B-",The Hours
20,sddavis63,"""It Goes On And On - And Nothing Happens""",1,3 August 2003,"So said the gay ex-lover of Richard (Ed Harris) - whose name I mercifully forget - about a book written by Richard - whose title I mercifully forget. But while the quote is about Richard's fictional book, the words serve also as an apt description of this movie, which goes on and on - and on and on - without anything really happening. OK. I exaggerate a wee bit. In the last twenty minutes or so some things do happen, but it sure takes a long time to get there, and the wait isn't worth the effort.The story is supposedly about how the lives of three women all revolve around a novel by Virginia Woolf: Virginia Woolf herself (Nicole Kidman) as she struggles to write the book, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) as she contemplates suicide, and Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) as she deals with her ex-husband Richard (who wrote the boring fictional book) who is now dying of AIDS. Frankly the story is not just dull; it's rather depressing, and I was never able to get into it from the very beginning. There was nothing here that interested me.I do confess, though, to being mystified by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts. This movie got eight Oscar nominations? And how in the world did Nicole Kidman win for Best Actress when - in my humble opinion - she wasn't even the lead actress in the movie? As far as I'm concerned that ""honour"" - dubious though it is in this project - belongs to Julianne Moore, whose character was much more central to the story and received much more screen time (and who was credited ahead of Kidman). But who can understand such things? All I know is - this was tedious viewing from start to finish.1/10",The Hours
21,ElMaruecan82,We're all destined to die but a few of us are destined to live...,8,11 March 2017,"Stephen Daldry's ""The Hours"" is a quiet and deep movie, of unprecedented narrative, that manage to keep us hooked to the stories of three different women, from different eras, at one pivotal day of their respective lives where they contemplate suicide, not directly for one of them.Nicole Kidman is Virginia Woolf, the famous author and feminist pioneer whose depression and mental vulnerabilities turned her to an acute spokesperson of the ennui the female bourgeois underwent from years of repressed passions and repressed responsibilities. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown, a typical suburban housewife of the 50's who would be the embodiment of marital happiness if deep inside, it wasn't just sheer emptiness. She feels a more genuine connection with a coquette and charming neighbor played by Toni Colette, but there's more than lesbian impulses torturing this heart. Finally, Clarissa Vaughan is a woman of the 21st century; she is bisexual, lives with a woman, has a daughter and helps a long-time friend named Richard, an AIDS-stricken poet played by Ed Harris. He's the most complex male character of the film and that he's agonizing with lucid resignation sort of connects him with the female plights.But ""The Hours"" doesn't try to deliver a feminist statement or any other message about homosexuality; these elements are accessories to the story but not focal points. The real issue is how a woman can feel totally embedded in her life to the point of suffocation, that these feelings, at the most banal occasions of life, can hit like an electric shock and they can't think of anything that is worth being happy for. But the three parallel lives are not without any connection whatsoever, the common thread is Virginia Woolf's celebrated novel, ""Mrs. Dellaway"", whose protagonist is an upper-class woman named Clarissa like the namesake Vaughan. Now, I didn't read the book, I only got glimpses of the story-line from the writing process during the Woolf's part, its effect on Laura Brown, and the life of Clarissa who represents a modern ""Mrs. Dellaway"".That I didn't read the book yet could feel what it was about from these meager but insightful hints says a lot about the remarkable construction of ""The Hours"". It probably kept the key elements of the book and diluted it into the lives of the three protagonists, the central question being death. Woolf knows that her book must feature one for the value of life can't be grasped if one doesn't die. She's an author and like so, doesn't believe in anything gratuitous happening, there must be a reason. Laura is sick of her life but rather than committing the irreparable act, she surrenders to her weakness, her deep love for her son. But later when she reappears, she mentions the premature death of her husband and her second child, and for some reason, there's not one ounce of grief, or guilt. It could be the passing of time, but the reality is that it was destiny showing her mercy and terminating her hellish boredom while she didn't have the guts to do it by itself.This little help of fate is incarnated by the climactic suicide committed by Richard, an act of despair and generosity toward the woman who dedicated so much time for him instead of thinking for herself. Indeed, all through that fateful day, Clarissa was busy preparing a reception for him, either being disconnected to her girlfriend (Alison Janney) or having a nervous breakdown when one of Richard's former friends, a teacher played by Jeff Daniels, comes to visit. Clarissa seems to live by proxy through that constant preoccupation which Richard mercifully terminated by putting an end to his misery. By that moment, we know he was the son of Laura, who was selfishly left in a house so she could go somewhere. and nowhere, it's like that fateful day instilled something of Woolf's suffering in his life, something that contemplated the passing of time, of hours, with an incapability to find form of happiness. Some kill themselves, some wait for death, some wait for the others to die.There's something of the 'Get busy living' or get busy dying'"" in that movie, the idea that not anyone can afford happiness and they must set the example to those who can, it's an act of sacrifice and human generosity. ""The Hours"" isn't a film for any audience and might easily be deemed as women's movie or artsy intellectual stuff but it says a lot more, that can even appeal to male. Maybe if the film was made today, it would have adopted a militant tonality, but I appreciate that the male characters were rather gentle and understanding people, who couldn't just reach the tortured souls of their wives. There's a failure of communication that men also owe to these years of domination, not that a lot changed in sixty years. When it comes to existential melancholy, some things can't just change.And ""The Hours"" is served by impeccable performances from Nicole Kidman, unrecognizable as Virginia Woolf, to the poignant vulnerability of Julianne Moore. Streep was nominated for ""Adaptation."" that year, but I don't know if she would have been nominated for ""The Hours"" anyway, she was good, but she played her usual vulnerable self, and it's so common from a 2000's standpoint that it surprises less than Kidman and Julianne who still had to hide being the façade of conveniences, they had it harder.And it's not a coincidence that Clarissa was the only one not to contemplate suicide.That might be the light of hope, maybe the ending is a happy now, at least, in the scale of unhappiness that forged women's lives all these years?",The Hours
22,paul2001sw-1,Wasted hours,3,10 May 2003,"Feminists seem to like their heroines tragic.  Sylvia Plath, Rosalind Franklin, Virginia Woolf, etc. it seems that if the life is both brilliant and sad, you can prove not only the talent of women but also the unfairness of society in one stroke. Of course this is patronising and, in its own way, sexist.  Talented women help make the feminist case by individual example, without needing to be mirrors of the society they live in; while a ruined life is no less sad if the individual is talentless, and (more tellingly) no more dramatic just because the individual had gifts.This is the second bad film based on Virginia's Woolf's book ""Mrs Dalloway"". The first, by Marleen Gorris, failed completely to tell the audience what the purpose of the story was; it meandered along pointlessly.  Stephen Daldry, on the other hand, makes the opposite error.  This film is about how women's lives are ruined because society expects them to consider only the needs of others, a message that is crystal clear within the first five minutes and then repeated throughout the movie, the repetition enforced by the use of a hyper-emotional and manipulative score.  Daldry's film at least gains some credit for its imaginative structure: we see Woolf writing the book from her own experience, a story accompanied not by ""Mrs Dalloway"" itself, per se, but rather by two later (and in fact interlinked) tales that reflect the themes of the actual work. But as in the previous film, there's little new that develops as the tale unfolds.Part of the problem is that Woolf and her fictional alter ego Dalloway are not particularly interesting.  If depression is caused by adverse circumstances, both women should count themselves lucky and pull themselves together, given they enjoy material comfort in an age when many of both sexes lived in terrible squalor; while, if we view depression as purely a medical condition, the fact that it affects a talented writer (as opposed to Jo Bloggs) adds nothing extra in the dramatic sense.  Nicole Kidman gives a good performance as Woolf, though it is odd that an actress used to playing glamour roles should get such massive credit simply for frumping down, whereas an able ""character actress"" would probably have passed unheralded in the role.  Also interesting is how Meryl Streep's performance as a pseudo-Dalloway almost exactly copies Vanessa Redgrave's performance in Gorris' film.  Sadly, what's not interesting is the film itself. In conclusion, its not quite as bad as its predecessor, but is self-indulgent and sanctimonious nonetheless.",The Hours
23,MOscarbradley,An astonishing adaptation of a 'difficult' book,10,19 May 2008,"An astonishing piece of film-making from Stephen Daldry, (it's only his second film), that is sure to be under-valued only because it is so damned entertaining. It's based on the novel by Michael Cunningham, (superbly adapted by David Hare), and it's about women linked inexorably by a book and over a number of decades. An art-house director might have made this film in black-and-white and with elliptical time-shifts that might have defied explanation; (he may even have used the same actress to play all three women, thus confusing us even further). Daldry and Hare, on the other hand, give it to us straight, although there is a twist of sorts in the conclusion, (all three stories have a common link and we might chastise ourselves for not 'getting it' sooner). Invariably, the film both thrills and moves us in equal measure.The book that links the three stories is ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and one of the women is Virginia Woolf, struggling to write it and contemplating her eventual suicide. She is played by an almost unrecognizable Nicole Kidman and superbly at that. Another woman in 1950's America is played by Julianne Moore, reading the novel and contemplating her own suicide. This kind of psycho-drama brings out the best in Moore. In the third story, (we movie seamlessly from one to the other and back again), Meryl Streep is a well-heeled lesbian publisher about to throw a party, (not unlike the one planned by Mrs. Dalloway in the novel), for a poet friend and former lover now dying of AIDS, (Ed Harris in a quietly magnificent performance), and who seems to have earned herself the sobriquet 'Mrs. Dalloway' as if, in some way, she has come to embody all the qualities of Woolf's eponymous heroine and whose own fragile mental state mirrors Woolf's to a degree. In the film's powerfully moving last chapter the two contemporary stories merge.This is the kind of richly intelligent entertainment that the 'commercial' cinema rarely gives us. It's a film for adults; by that I mean it's a film for people who have experienced what life can throw at them and it requires a degree of concentration. The three women at the centre act brilliantly, (this is Streep's best work in years), but the entire cast to the smallest part rise to the occasion, (even the cameos are beautifully etched). At first glance Cunningham's novel seems the kind of 'difficult' book that just won't work on the screen but Daldry, Hare and company conclusively prove that is not the case. Astonishing.",The Hours
24,gbill-74877,Somber but meaningful,8,26 March 2020,"A film that seemed to me both an intertwining and an unraveling. An intertwining in the sense that there is a connection across the decades in these three women, and an unraveling in that each is going through an existential crisis and is quietly despondent, despite having what seems to be a good life. The stories are told in 1923, 1951, and 2001, with excellent period details in each, and the cast is incredibly deep, led by the incomparable Meryl Streep.It's a sad but moving work about seeing life for what it is, and being true to oneself. Sexual or perhaps romantic frustration plays a part of this, as the women from the earlier generations (Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore) yearn for other women despite their marriages, and the one in the third (Streep) is ironically with another woman but yearns for an old lover (Ed Harris) dying of AIDS. It goes deeper than that though, as parts of their depression stem from things like living in too quiet of places, in how conventional their lives are, or simply realizing that real happiness in life is sometimes just a moment, or maybe even just an illusion. There is the sense of stifling confinement in these characters, and frustration at the sameness and repetition of it all. Sometimes people hang on to life not even for themselves anymore, but for those around them, and sometimes they can't.As you can probably guess, all this adds up to something pretty somber and dark, but I find strength in knowing that others also struggle, and was touched by a film I might otherwise have thought as decent but a little over-constructed. As Woolf wrote in Mrs. Dalloway, the novel at the center of the film, there may be solace in looking at death less fearfully, and more as a release:""Did it matter that she must inevitably cease, completely. All this must go on without her. Did she resent it? Or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely? It is possible to die. It is possible to die.""There is bravery in facing one's unhappiness, and taking a conscious decision to either self-realize by making a change necessary to survive, or to commit suicide, dispassionately, and with a fond goodbye. We see that either path is inherently selfish - forcing your partner to uproot and move, or abandoning your husband and kids, or simply saying ""I love you. I don't think two people could have been happier than we've been,"" before taking a final leave of them. There are no easy answers, but to continue living someone else's dream, counting the hours in frustration, doesn't seem right either, and there is empowerment in that.",The Hours
25,g-bodyl,Well-Acted Film!,8,1 August 2014,"I didn't know what to make of this film, The Hours. For one, I think it may be a little overrated. But on the other hand, it's far from a bad film and it's quite powerful. But one thing for sure, this film is dark, depressing, and dreary since the overall topic of the movie is on a weighty matter and that is suicide. This film celebrates life, but it also makes a case on how life is very hard and how people sometimes make decisions to end it. This film is eye-opening, but very darn depressing.Stephen Daldry's film tells the story in the eyes of three women, many years apart, but somehow their lives are interconnected. There is Virginia Wolff who is mentally unstable and working on a novel called ""Mrs. Dalloway"" that is very influential in this movie. There is Laura Brown who is an unhappily married 1950's housewife. Finally, there is Clarissa who is organizing a party for one of her friends who is in the final stages of AIDS.This is one of those films that rely on the acting and what an acting powerhouse this film is. Nicole Kidman was superb as Wolff and deserves her Oscar. Julianne Moore was also excellent as Laura Brown. Meryl Streep is great in everything, no exception here. But she seemed to take a sidestep to both Kidman and Moore. Ed Harris was phenomenal as the AIDS-stricken man.Overall, The Hours is a powerful movie that will probably hit home hard one way or another. On such a weighty topic, this film will get you thinking. Although it's about suicide, I think of it as more of a celebration of life and how life shall be remembered. This film may be a little slow at times, but it packs quite a punch. There is also a wonderful film score by Philip Glass as well that adds in the effectiveness. I rate this film 8/10.",The Hours
26,secondtake,"Suicide, lesbian love, avant-garde fiction, stellar acting, and high drama...not bad for one movie",9,28 September 2013,"The Hours (2002)A layered, vivid, ambitious movie with literary and emotional strains that weave through an eighty year sandwich of parallel stories. And some of the acting is just fabulous. An excellent movie.At the core is the modernist writer, Virginia Woolf, famous for being one of the great original voices of literature in the 20th Century, and for her personal struggle against mental illness, which led to her 1941 suicide (shown in the first scene in the movie). We know the drama is going to be high, and that there is a real history underpinning it all.But it's fiction, too. Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"" is being written in the earliest (1920s) narrative, showing Woolf herself (Nicole Kidman). This book is being read in the second narrative (with Julianne Moore being the reader, a 1950s housewife with some mental instability of her own). And the contemporary (2001) narrative is a take on the Dalloway story, with echoes from the other two threads--here a writer is dying of aids and his best friend and caretaker, nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway for fun, is trying to keep him from committing suicide.For me it was this last story that made the movie take hold. The writer is played by a surprisingly sickly looking Ed Harris, and his friend is played by Meryl Streep. These are two of Hollywood's great actors--the kinds of actors who take on a variety of roles and really change movie to movie. And their scenes together are like the best stage dramas you could ask for. For this alone the movie is worth soaking up.In the 1920s world it is Kidman who is central--and in a real way she is the center of the idea of the movie, if not its filming. Woolf is of course the source of it all. And Kidman (who is no match for Streep in her career but who wants to be, to her credit) pulls off one of her best performances. Her husband, the somber and loving Leopold, tries to keep Woolf healthy, both physically (by making her eat) and mentally (by giving her support). That he fails, ultimately, is visible in his body language. (The actor is Stephen Dillane.) Besides this key relationship, the scenes in 20s are a little stilted, as if surviving on the aura of the times more than the events, which are minimal until the tragic climax.In a similar way, the 1950s story is dripping with 50s set design and stereotypes of lonely housewives and sweet children and emotional restraint. There's truth to all this of course, but I was there, almost (as a kid) and there was another kind of intensity and life that is somehow missing here. Moore is rather good, though for me a bit trapped by the character she has to play. There is a nice twist to this story as it goes, which is a tonic to the general dread.Which brings us back to the current realm and Streep and Harris, and most of all Streep who is juggling several balls at once in a masterful (another masterful) performance.There seems to be everything here for a perfect movie, including an excellent script. The themes themselves are what end up too simplified and frankly too pushy to quite work. An extra parallel of a lesbian subplot in each case is interesting and actually helpful (some critics didn't like it), though a bit forced into the 1950s version. (The whole 1950s segment kept me thinking of ""Far From Heaven"" with its themes and period set design--and Julianne Moore--also released in 2002.)Sadly, the score by Philip Glass is a droning, intrusive distraction. There is a good logic to making a score have no sense of its own era, so that it can float across the shifting periods in a unifying way. But it's that kind of canned Glass stuff that can be brilliant at its best but is here insensitive to the movie, and weirdly dry in its colorful tunefulness. Still, I say this is one you should watch once, and should see again if you think you've seen it enough already. There's a lot to admire, a lot to think about, and a lot to digest. The best of it is, well, among the best.",The Hours

""The Hours"" offers the viewer, a fabulously edited movie that reveals the intersection, lapping of three eras of time with three lesbians in their moments, including the famous Virginia Woolfe, and their relationships with men and women. The casting and acting of Ed Harris is particularly fascinating in comparing his role as Richard Brown in this movie to his role in Pollock, as the brilliant but fragile artist, Jackson Pollock. In both roles he plays leading creative artists in their respective fields, but Mr. Harris plays each role with subtle differences that highlight his range of talent. His performance in Hours is easily worthy of a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination along with John C. Reilly's role in Chicago. All of the acting, the script were well done. The blending of subplots excellent. What is intriguing is the hypothesis of how lesbianism is played out in different eras and how that might play into how each actress plays out her life in their own time. Unlike some critics, this movie isn't so morbid or depressing as refreshing, optimistic, and a lifting up of the individual, willful spirit in a strong message to women.

We see the angst of the women but gain only a superficial understanding of the demons within them. The three stars are equally good, although it is Kidman's nose that won the Oscar for Best Actress.

29,The-Sarkologist,A Movie which is based on a book that is based on a book.,5,29 September 2013,"The thing about this movie is that it is based on a book that has significant connections with a second book, which means that if you do not know the book that the book is based on then it can be difficult to understand what is going on. The book, 'The Hours' is, not so much based on, but written out of, a book by Virginia Woolf called Mrs Dalloway. I have heard of the book, and have a vague idea about what the book is about, but I haven't read it, and don't plan on reading it until the next time I am in London (namely because somebody said that Mrs Dalloway is a book that one should read while wondering around London, and if there is one place in London that I like to read books, it is on a seat next to the Round Pond in Kensington Gardens, looking over at a palace, while drinking a cup of tea).Anyway, Mrs Dalloway is set during a single day and begins with Mrs Dalloway going off and buying some flowers, and then spends the rest of the day preparing for a party. The Hours is about three women who are connected, one of them being Virginia Woolf as she writes Mrs Dalloway, and the other two, one in the 1940s, the other in 2001, preparing for a party. I will not say too much about the connections between two of the woman, but obviously one of the connections involves the book Mrs Dalloway, which is how Virginia Woolf is connected with the other two.I have seen something like this before, with Cloud Atlas, where you seem to have three disconnected stories, but they are connected by a simple thread. However, like Cloud Atlas, the connections in this story run a lot deeper. For instance, the women are both preparing for a party, and the woman begin by going out and buying flowers. The connection with Virginia Woolf though is simply through the book Mrs Dalloway.I wasn't a big fan of this film, though I did actually think Nicole Kidman played Virginia Woolf really well (and I am not a big fan of Kidman). Meryl Streep also played her role well, however because I have not read the book, it is difficult for me to compare the characters in the film with those in the book, however if I am to read the book, it will definitely be after I have read Mrs Dalloway, which means it will be after I go to London for a third time.",The Hours

Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf is extraordinary. Julianne Moore as a 1950's housewife reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"" does well with a difficult part.  Meryl Streep, as a modern-day intellectual who has been nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" demonstrates, as always, that she is the finest American actor on the screen.  She is a treasure.Ed Harris as Streep's former lover, now dying of AIDS, is magnificent. The rage and sadness he feels appear to be directly transmitted from him to us, without requiring the medium of cinema to intercede.Be advised--after a cheerful opening that lasts no more than five minutes, the film is consistently sad and depressing throughout.  This isn't a criticism--just a statement of fact.  If you are looking for ""Sound of Music,"" this is not the movie for you.",The Hours
31,filipemanuelneto,"An excellent film, with great actresses playing wonderfully... but with a series of difficult, dark and very depressing subjects.",8,15 February 2021,"There are few writers in the 20'th century who have had lives as troubled and tragic as Virginia Woolf. Born in a golden cradle, she was sexually abused by her older siblings to the point of becoming depressed and having developed schizophrenia and a repressed bisexuality. A short life, which she decided to end by drowning in a river in 1941.This film is not about this writer, but it does use her life and one of her most notable books, ""Mrs. Dalloway"", to tells a day in the life of three women from three different times: a day in the life of Virginia Woolf in 1923, a day in the life of a married woman in 1951 and a day in the life of a woman preparing a party in honor of a friend, about to die of AIDS, in 2001. One is the writer of the novel, another is a reader who will read it, and the other is a woman who, due to her attitudes, will embody the main character of the book.It is a very profound, psychological, often dark film, that addresses fear and trauma, weaknesses, depressions and repressed homosexuality. The protagonists, for different reasons and in their own way, are depressed women, who suffer in silence while the world goes around them and try to play their social role and correspond to what everyone expects of them. However, there is always a moment of break, where the urge to throw the towel on the floor is irresistible. In spite of everything, the film is a little lukewarm, slow and almost half-enveloping. Another problem is the inability, on the part of the audience, to like the characters. I, at least, did not feel emotionally involved in the film.The cast is headed by three grand actresses: Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore. The three fulfil their audience perfectly, with well-succeeded interpretations. However, as I said, they are distant performances, which put a wall between the audience and the film. It is nothing that takes merit from the actresses, but it does not help the film to become pleasant, and it is a film that I would hardly see again, if I had a choice.Technically, it is a very well-made film, but it has discrete production values. It has a clear and well-built cinematography, good sets and costumes, which help us to see and distinguish the different times and contexts. I especially liked the period automobiles that were used, and the set of Virginia Woolf's house, full of decorative details and lovingly elaborated. And I cannot fail to highlight the wonderful soundtrack, particularly the suite ""The Hours"", composed by Philip Glass.",The Hours

33,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Fantastic drama with a literary tone; editing and acting keep it truly cinematic,9,21 January 2009,"""The Hours"" is not typical Hollywood dramatic fare. Its storytelling is much more literary--it has the silent, deeply dramatic quality of both a stage play and a novel, putting aside that it's based on the Michael Cunningham novel of the same title. Still, the way this film is edited to intertwine the three major plot lines and the way these talented actresses play their characters almost entirely in their faces at times makes it just as strong as a movie as it would be anything else.Three story lines connected to the book ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by Virginia Woolf are the focus of ""The Hours."" The first is of Woolf herself, played by Nicole Kidman, wrestling with the insanity that ultimately amounts in her death by suicide. The second is of a 1950s housewife (Julianne Moore) who is reading the book as she deals with her own feelings of unhappiness, and the third is a woman (Streep) in 2001 who is trying to throw a party for her former lover (Ed Harris) who is an author dying from AIDS that lovingly refers to her as the book's titular character.The most satisfying thing about this film is that it features some of the most unique and best work by quality actors who have never given such performances before in their careers. Kidman, in her Oscar-winning part as Virginia Woolf, simply transforms herself in a way we've never seen, even as remarkable as she was in ""Moulin Rouge!"" Tackling a character whose head you can really never truly get into the way she did, communicating as well as she was able to and bringing difficult dialog to a level that all could understand are some of the reasons she deserved her win. Moore is also incredible: her inner-monologue has you understanding her character and her struggles from start to finish. Harris also shows he can do versatility playing as distinct a character as the dying Richard. Streep is quite good too, but this is nothing we haven't seen her do before and even better.The story, though very introspective and lacking in action much of the time, is fascinating in the way that all three plots are entirely different but draw on the same ideas. Each, for example, addresses a homosexual impulse and each deals with attempts or thoughts of suicide. Naturally they all become inherently similar, and the way the film is edited to flash from one to other as early as the beginning credits suggests that they are all unified in some way. Director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot"") keeps the film easy to understand despite jumping back and forth, with due credit also to screenwriter David Hare.This is a film that despite looking at life from a difficult and depressing standpoint, is about dealing with a mundane, dissatisfying life and searching for an answer to it--a way out, a way to happiness. It dares to understand why we make the choice to live and why, sometimes, we make the choice to die. Once again, a difficult subject, but one that this film offers profound perspective on. Perhaps it's non-traditional in that all the plots take place in a one day span and a lot of the ""action"" is dialog, but its ability to work and weave all three women's lives is film-making at its finest.",The Hours
34,bsmith5552,Absorbing Drama With Fine Performances,8,28 August 2003,"""The Hours"" is about three women in three different time periods and how their lives are similar and yet very different. Director Stephen Daldry skillfully cuts back and forth between the three stories at parallel points in their lives.Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman, almost unrecognizable) is writing a novel called ""Mrs. Dalloway"" in the 1920s and is trying to decide which of the main characters she will kill off. She sees herself as the title character in the novel so in effect, she is contemplating her own suicide. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in the 1950s is reading Woolf's novel and is experiencing some of the same problems depicted in the book. The third woman is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) living in the present and seemingly is the happier of the three...but is she?All three have lesbian leanings and all are suicidal. Clarissa is living in a lesbian relationship with partner Sally (Allison Janney) and has a daughter Julia (Clare Danes) through artificial insemination. She is caring for distraught, mad at the world poet/author Richard Brown (Ed Harris) who is dying of AIDS. Clarissa is planning to host a party in honor of Brown who has won a prestigious award for his poetry but, an unexpected tragedy occurs.Virginia in an apparent loveless marriage with Leonard Woolf (Stephen Dillane) is having problems dealing with her sexuality causing her mental anguish. She is very devoted to her sister Vanessa (Miranda Richardson) although Vanessa seems reluctant to return that love.Laura has a devoted husband (John C. Reilly) and an adoring little son (Jack Rovello) yet she is not happy and contemplates suicide. She tries to initiate a lesbian relationship with neighbor Kitty Barlowe (Toni Collette) but Kitty seems uninterested.Although Kidman won the 2002 Best Actress Oscar, all three leading ladies would have been equally deserving. And Ed Harris' riveting performance stands out as well. Jeff Daniels makes an all too brief appearance as Harris' former lover.""The Hours"" is the kind of film that you have to watch more than once to appreciate. After seeing it for the first time you can better understand and appreciate the complex storyline in subsequent viewings.Not for everyone but nonetheless a great film.",The Hours
35,meeza,Keeps on ticking with great acting!,8,11 March 2003,"Who's afraid of the bid bad Woolf? I will tell you who: the Prozac-deficient women of `The Hours'. The film is set in one melancholic day of 3 women of three different decades who are all affected by Virginia Woolf's book `Mrs. Dalloway'. Nicole Kidman portrays Virginia Woolf as a sadistic writer who is in a state of absolute depression. Kidman, who is unrecognizable with a prosthetic nose, sure had the nose to play the part. I do smell an Oscar nomination for Nicky.  Julianne Moore plays a suburban 50's housewife who is unhappy in her `June Cleaver' world. Her role is not too far from the one she recently portrayed in `Far From Heaven' even though that was a far better movie. Moore was as amazing in `The Hours' as she was in `Far From Heaven'. Meryl Streep plays a 21st century lesbian who is a caretaker to an ex male lover dying of Aids. Meryl's legacy as a great actress continues with her disclosed `streep' show. Ed Harris, who plays the Aids-carrier, also continues his extravagant Mr. Ed acting show with his emotional performance. `The Hours' is being acclaimed by many of `hour' critics as the best film of the year. I would not label `The Hours' in that echelon state. However- It is a focused intrinsic study of women, suicide, and lesbianism. So I recommend for you to reserve a couple of hours out of your day, and spend the time partaking `The Hours'. **** Good",The Hours
36,CubsandCulture,An experiment that doesn't quite work,8,22 February 2020,"Wolf's book ""Mrs Dalloway"" is very much about the inner turmoil of a woman who feels suffocated by her social world. Not much happens in terms of observable behavior. It is a wonderful book but it is decidedly uncinematic. Cunningham's fanfic triptych The Hours also share this quality. Much of that novel is about the *inner* life of the characters. Both novels form the basis of this film. I don't think ultimately it works. Too much is left unspecified and it is hard to feel the material as a result. The Laura Brown section especially struggles at dramatizing the social alienation that character is feeling. Only the Woolf section, because Woolf is given a clear drive, is fully successful as cinema. Probably the film's weak point is how the score's melodramatic tenor tries to patch up the script's weaknesses.With that being said this is still a worthwhile film to watch. The triptych structure is unique; the acting-Kidman!-is worth experiencing at least once. And the film's formal elements of direction are quite good.",The Hours
37,Chris_Docker,"Have You Got a Moment? A Real, Real Moment?",10,9 March 2003,"Three top actresses (Moore, Streep, Kidman) give incredible performances to interweave three different stories, linking together through time and space women re-defining themselves, finding meaning in their relationships, in life and death, and discovering what is important. You'll either find this Virginia Woolf biopic profoundly moving (as I did) or it will leave you cold. With brilliant use of intertextuality, this is a movie that can change your life, even as the novel being written by its first main character galvanises self-revelatory experiences in the second and is epitomised by the third.(The following contains some plot spoilers:) Of the six main characters, two commit suicide and one aborts a suicide at the last minute. Around each of the suicides, an unusual bonding is apparent. As the death of Richard approaches, a poet and friend loved by Clarissa, she reflects to herself on the short time they had once had as lovers, many years previously. She recalls a certain moment when, one beautiful sleepy-eyed morning, he had come out the house and placed his hand on her shoulder. She had felt at the time (expecting their love affair to last) that that moment was ""the beginning of happiness."" Viewed in that way it could easily cause only pain and disappointment. Yet it was a very special, seminal moment in her life.Another way of looking at it, one which Clarissa, in a moment of realisation eventually adopts, is not that it was the beginning of happiness, but that it was happiness. Woolf, in her writing, concentrated on such ""moments of being"" - significant moments when we get an insight into what is really important.It can come as a surprise that such pivotal experiences may last only a few seconds, yet provide the seed for a person to live on in memory forever. They are often as not found in small, seemingly insignificant everyday words and actions, that in some way are unique and personal.Richard, the award winning poet in the story, always Clarissa the feeling that her life is 'trivial' - at least when she is not with him. She is a capable, successful woman, yet she fears that what he says is true - that she is ""always giving parties to cover the silence"".  Yet ironically a poet's work consists of taking the seemingly trivial and immortalising it into a thing of beauty and wonder. Clarissa, in the emotional upheaval surrounding Richard's death, comes to value that which is trivial, the small things that can equally be momentous. Just before Richard ends his life, he recalls the exact same moment of his hand on her shoulder many years before, showing her how he has treasured it too.The simple act of buying flowers occurs repeatedly in the film, emphasising the small and seemingly unimportant, but making it personal and very special - something we can aspire to do with what otherwise would be many trivial moments in our relationships with loved ones. Richard speaks of  `The way the flowers look when you carry them in your arms' - it is no longer the physical gift, or even the beauty of the flowers themselves, but the sum of the shared experience creating a special moment of poetic majesty that helps to define the characters to each other.After watching the film I thought about the important people in my life and what they meant to me. I tried to encapsulate the special things, different in each of them, that brought flashes of love and inspiration. I started with ""What special thing that they do or say would I miss if this person were no longer in my life?"" and ""What quality of characteristic was it / is it that brings a moment of magic / inspiration into my being (for want of a better word) when I recall it?"" When I had done it, I found I had defined each of them in my own vocabulary, a vocabulary of ""why this person is important to me"".The three women characters in the film have outwardly contented lives invaded by unhinging thoughts of mortality and despondency. The imminence of death, that of someone else or their own, leads them to think beyond the superficiality of their day-to-day 'success' and review what is really crucial, both in their own identity and in relating to loved ones. Each of them focuses on someone beyond themselves. The three interwoven stories also show how easily one can push one's life into a corner of hopelessness and yet, by re-discovering 'moments of being' re-define themselves and their relationships.Death is sometimes seen as liberation - liberation from pain, suffering, indignity; yet it can also be seen as a liberation in a way that life can be a liberation. Woolf in her suicide note speaks of looking life in the face, of truly knowing it, and loving it, and then putting it away. This implies a true freedom to choose. A difficulty with both the suicides in the film is that we are unsure how 'unbearable' the suffering is. The choice is clearly defined - the two persons who choose death do so after fully embracing life - one to escape madness and one to escape lingering illness. But there is the suspicion that Woolf's madness (the reason she gave for ending her life) was, in part, the isolation of a genius that no-one really understood or accepted. There is the feeling that Richard could have lived on. ""That is what people do - they stay alive for each other"" says Clarissa, rebuking him for wanting to die when he says quite roughly that he is only staying alive for her sake. ""Just wait until I die, then you will have to think of yourself"" he retorts. Each of the characters at some point live solely for another person - that is their choice, but they also come to the point where they are in control of their choices and make the survivor realise that such a choice is a gift, not a right. Dying Richard struggles with the loss he will cause Clarissa by choosing suicide, recalling memories of his mother, who eventually abandoned him, his own feelings of loss and pain as a boy. The film's three stories examine the cost of different choices - of being a caregiver - of being a devoted wife and mother - of being an artist risking insanity. Laura, in a parallel story, has devoted herself to her husband and child to the point where life has no meaning for her, even though her life has fulfilled theirs. This brings her to make a very difficult choice.
The liberation of women over the last century provides a parallel theme - society still has not found a way to show full acceptance to a woman who wants to define her own role and women consequently often find themselves in a trap of unfulfilment before realizing it. The three women in The Hours fight against unfulfilment and, in doing so, enrich both their own lives and the lives of those around them. Woolf's doctor suggests that she remain quiet, in the countryside, yet Woolf, her great mind imprisoned in a world where she is now expected to do 'needlework' reacts against her loving husband's accusation of ingratitude: ""Ungrateful? My life has been stolen from me. I'm living a life I have no wish to live.""Of the characters that commit suicide, each of them justify it either face to face or posthumously, and they also commemorate the achievements of their life in terms of their relationship to the individuals that love them. Richard does this by raising Clarissa's spirits to a peak of spiritual union by touching the deep love she still has for him so many years later (even though there are both now gay) and showing her that he bears her exactly the same love. Woolf enshrines and immortalises her love for her adoring husband in her suicide note, exhorting to go on and to cherish the special time they have shared - ""Always the years between us, always the years, always the love. Always the hours.""The finality of death can make special memories immutable. In this way it becomes a way of making a gift by dying to the living. Why do people die? And the poet answers, `So the rest of us value life more' We can also ask what is it that makes life worthwhile? A recurring theme in the film has been the small, seemingly insignificant moments that pass between two people. Moments to treasure forever - even when life has gone. Virginia Woolf struggled in her novels to capture and articulate such evanescent flashes and show how they are really perhaps the most important thing in our lives and what we hold most dear. We can analyse greatness, and the benefits it brings, but when we ask why then the answer often lies in the light it has added to someone's life. Some of these might even be posthumous: the artist surrounded by people who cannot comprehend the depth of the artist's work but for whom the understanding of future generations will be its reward. There are arguably limits to this idea - the beauty of a flower may be lost on someone clinging for life to the edge of a precipice - although one might equally say that if one were to find oneself falling off the precipice into oblivion (or conversely being rescued from the edge) then that moment of glimpsing that flower might have a profound and uplifting significance, especially if it were etched in the memory as a moment of special tenderness shared with the most important person in one's life. Similarly, such shared moments live on when someone has died.
Such memories are best when linked with a certainty that the choices taken were the only possible choices. As the character Laura says towards the end of the film, ""What does it mean to regret when you have no choice?"" But the greater the degree of choice, the greater the gift. The lessons we learn from the finality of death can also enrich our life with every parting if we truly hold dear to the 'moments of being' experienced with that person. We need freedom of action and life choices to be free to experience such moments. Once we have that in ourselves, it could perhaps be said that only then are we are truly free to give to another. In focussing our mind on special moments, and knowing the chance for creating them will never appear twice, death gives us a gift of a life more treasured.",The Hours
38,arthur_tafero,Best Film of 2002; not Chicago- The Hours,9,4 January 2019,"Why a fluff film like Chicago won Best Picture of 2002 is beyond my comprehension, although I do understand that the general American movie audience is fairly immature; they prefer musicals to actual scripts. American audiences are relatively illiterate as well; they probably think Virginia Woolf is Elizabeth Taylor, and that her husband was Richard Burton. Only a very small percentage of the American public (less than 10%) even knows who Virginia Woolf is or how she died, or why she committed suicide. This film is told in three voices; all connected with the same emotional ties and complexities. The central theme is the expectations of others; obligations rather than what we truly are or want in life. It crosses the sexual limitiations of the film and goes well beyond those limitations. How many of us work at a job we really love? Live with a person we really love? The questions can be countless. Repressed sexuality is just one of them. The tragedy of all three women featured in this film is their inability to escape from their obligations and seek their true natures. A well-made film.",The Hours

Everyone glowers, mumbles, and shouts dramatically while monotonous piano music accompanies the simplistic melodrama trying to pass itself off as psychologically nuanced conflict. On the whole, this is a movie where little happens beyond lip-service to some grand theme on suicide and pain-- all of the characters are stereotypes one way or another, acted in much the same gloomy register. The three stories are all shallow and uninteresting on their own, and do not add up to much when strung together the way they are. The best I can say is that the movie looks good in terms of costuming and cinematography, and the editing is outstanding, but the actual narrative content is a pretentious bore.",The Hours

43,Boyo-2,Moore is amazing,7,17 April 2003,"In all honesty, as much as I liked Nicole Kidman's performance, the movie was made for me with Julianne Moore's.  She made me so nervous, has me so much on edge, cause you didn't know what the hell was wrong with her.  Did she have a crush on Toni Collette?  Did she just have a breakdown?  Does she want to burn the house down?  To the movie's credit, you don't know what exactly is wrong, until the end.  But as tense as it made me, I realized that in most movies you are clearly tipped off as far as who is angry, and why.   This movie doesn't, and I didn't appreciate that until it was over.
Kidman was great, but I've always thought she had more talent than she was given credit for.  Not many people could have made ""To Die For"" so convincing.  Kudos to Nic for her career choices, post-divorce.
Streep, Ed Harris and Jeff Daniels were non-entities.  I worship Streep and Ed Harris, but their part of the story didn't do a single thing for me.  I kept waiting to see if Julianne was going to drive her car off a cliff. Without having seen all the nominees in Best Supporting Actress, I'd have to say another actress would have to go pretty damn far to impress me as much as she did.  8/10.",The Hours
44,rbverhoef,Just terrific,9,31 May 2003,"'The Hours' is about three stories. The first, set in 1923, is about Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) writing the novel Mrs. Dalloway. The second is set in 1951 and is about Laura (Julianne Moore) reading Mrs. Dalloway. The third is set in 2001 and is about Clarissa (Meryl Streep) living the same life as Mrs. Dalloway. We switch between these stories in one way, but in another way it is one big story told in different times.The movie has the best ensemble a movie can have: the acting is more than great. Nicole Kidman gives probably the best performance but may be it seems that way because you don't recognize her at all. Not in appearance, not in voice. She won the Academy Award for her Virginia Woolf (after her nomination last year for 'Moulin Rouge!'). Julianne Moore was nominated for her supporting role in this movie, and for another great performance in 'Far from Heaven'. Thirteen time Academy Award nominee Meryl Streep was also nominated but for her part in 'Adaptation', also the same year as this movie. Moore and Streep give terrific performances. Ed Harris as the ex-husband of Clarissa is very good and was also nominated for an Academy Award. Other great parts by John C. Reilly (in the same year he appeared in award winning movies like 'Gangs of New York', 'Chicago', 'The Good Girl' and 'The Hours'), Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney, Toni Collette, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Dillane and Claire Danes. Not one of them is bad or annoying, they all do the best they can do in this movie.The acting, together with a great story perfectly edited, a fantastic direction by Stephen Daldry, make-up very well done (see Kidman and later on Moore), some nice photography and beautiful music composed by Philip Glass this is one of those movies you will remember.",The Hours

47,aimless-46,Some Random Thoughts from a Twisted Mind,10,9 June 2005,"""The Hours"" more than lives up to its critical praise. If nothing else it is a must see for the originality of the technique. The film (and the book by Michael Cunningham) is structured around the process of linking up three stories set at different points in time. Each story concerns a woman trying to define herself, to identify what she needs, and to find a way to get it.The 1920's story concerns Virginia Woolf's (Kidman) efforts to write her first successful novel, ""Mrs. Dallaway""; which is the story of one day in the life of a woman named Clarissa Dallaway. The story set in the early 1950's concerns Laura Brown (Moore), a woman who is reading ""Mrs. Dallaway"". Finally the contemporary story concerns Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) who is essentially living Mrs. Dallaway's life in modern NYC. All three performances are extraordinary in their own unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of the supporting cast. It is as if each member of the ensemble brought out the best in each other.Some interesting and not always obvious things to look for as you watch ""The Hours"" are:Each story begins with the husband/lover of each woman leading the camera to the woman. All three women are found in bed and this begins a match cut process that will repeat itself throughout the film as the director and editor work to connect and unify the three separate stories. Woolf writes: ""Mrs. Dallaway said she would buy the flowers herself"" just as Laura Brown reads that sentence and Clarissa speaks that sentence.Kidman's Woolf is an amazing character. She is a psychological mess, making life difficult for those around her and full of torment and despair. Yet she has a subtle charm that helps you to understand why people found her fascinating.Like ""The Big Chill"", this is an ambitious character study film with many characters. By necessity, both films rely more on behavioral language than dialogue in revealing the personality of its characters. Note Laura Brown's (Moore) neatness obsession as she readies her house and herself prior to leaving for the hotel.Woolf began the book ""Mrs. Dallaway"" with the intention of basing it on a society woman she knew who unexpectedly committed suicide. Brown describes the book to her neighbor as: ""Oh, it's about this woman who's incredibly - well, she's a hostess and she's incredibly confident and she's going to give a party. And, maybe because she's confident, everyone thinks she's fine... but she isn't"".At its core this is a movie about art but it is a broad definition of art, writing a book-baking a cake-giving a party. Each woman/artist is driven and frustrated by a need for unattainable perfection. There is a touch of irony to each situation. For example, Laura Brown is where she is because her husband has pulled her into the great American dream without realizing that it was the worse thing he could do to her. Although all three women love their children/child/niece, those relationships do not give them what they need.There is a visitor and a kiss in each story central to the self-definition process each woman is going through. Virginia kisses her sister Vanessa (brilliantly played by Miranda Richardson who looks amazingly like she could have been Kidman's sister), desperately trying to force a better connection with her. Vanessa understands this, she is not shocked by the kiss but by the implication that her sister needs this so desperately.Sophie Wyburd who plays Virginia's young niece was obviously cast for her haunting voice and her ability to display such a focused intensity. Each woman has a child picking up on their needs, which the adults around them do not seem to be aware of.Watch the scene where Laura's husband is urging her to come to bed. Moore's voice does not betray the revulsion or the internal struggle which only viewers can see on her face. In fact at this point each woman's partner is urging her to go to bed but each must first a make choice. Then watch for the great match cut, Virginia announces that she has decided that the poet will die in her novel and they cut to little Richard lying in his bed. Moore's expression finally tells us that she has decided to leave her family. Streep's kiss signifies her recognition of the preciousness of what she still has in her life and her choice to embrace it and move forward.Ultimately this film is about the increasing difficulty we have as we get older in making choices. This is because as we discover who we are, we also experience loss and accumulate grief over the course of our lives, making us ever more aware of the cost of our choices. Like the Moonlight Graham character in ""Field of Dreams"" (who assumed he would have more than one major league at bat), Clarissa looks back on a short moment that she thought was the beginning of happiness and realizes that it was her only moment of actual happiness.There are some criticisms of this film. That it is not political enough but rather is for the elite and about the elite, or conversely that it is condescending to the masses with too obvious a message told in an unnecessarily simplistic way, and finally that it is a success of structure rather than ideas. Whatever the validity of these issues, the very fact that discussions are at this elevated level is the best testimonial the film could have. My only criticism was a production design issue, young Richard gets his Lincoln logs out of a Erector Set box.",The Hours
48,rosscinema,Excellent performances raise film,7,12 March 2003,"While this film is tough to view because it is depressing you just cannot dismiss it based on that because its about depression. Three different stories with two of them being related. The first is Nicole Kidman playing Virginia Woolf who battled depression her whole life and ultimately allowed it to take her life. Kidmans performance is deep and very heartfelt. She does portray the pain in her character. I wish the film could have been exclusively about her! Thats one of my big complaints. She deserves to have this story expanded. Its a very strong job of acting and arguably the best in the film. The second story has Julianne Moore playing a housewife in the 50's who is affected by the writings of Virginia Woolf and has a difficult time getting through each day. One day she decides to get a hotel room and commit suicide. Her husband John C. Reilly has no clue what's going on with her but her son does. He obviously can feel and sense his mothers pain. The third story has Meryl Streep as a lesbian getting ready to throw a party but she must keep checking on her friend Ed Harris who has AIDS and is very depressed. I didn't really buy Streep as a lesbian but Harris is very good in two or three very emotional scenes. He really conveys a dying man who is both desperate and confused. The narrative of the film is not its best asset. Its the performances. Stephen Daldry has the tough task of trying to weave these stories in a manner that the audience can feel the pain of each character. The results are mixed and like I said they should have just had Kidmans segment expanded to a full feature. So while I did have problems with the way this film tries to weld three stories in one film with mixed results, you can't argue with the performances. Kidman and Harris are the two best things and Moore and Streep are not bad either. I do recommend this tough effort.",The Hours
49,nycritic,A Life Thrice-Permutated.,10,17 December 2005,"One woman prepares to write her magnum opus: the story of one day in the life of an Everywoman we know as ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Another woman reads ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and is overwhelmed by the banality of her life. And yet another third is actually living the plot of this celebrated novella. And in all three stories, the ghost of death by suicide permeates the film with a growing sense of tragedy about to strike.Michael Cunningham and director Stephen Daldry bring forth a moving story of these three women and their relationship to one another despite the fact they could be living in self-enclosed universes. Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) and Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) for example are two women who will never meet, but share a common thread: a repressed feminist streak that perhaps time, or their own gender would not allow them to fulfil. It is interesting to note that both women have a scene in which they kiss another woman. Virginia suddenly kisses her sister and Laura, in a moment of revelation between a neighbor, does the same. Both then become aware of a growing reality around them -- that there is a larger, inner truth about themselves -- but one that will drive them to an act of self-immolation in perfect isolation.The third woman in question is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) who lives at the end of the Twentieth Century and is a lesbian in a relationship. She lives a life with much more freedom than her two counterparts never experienced, yet her freedom isn't without some dark points. A sense of meaninglessness grows within herself as she takes care of a friend and brilliant writer, Richard Brown (Ed Harris) who is in the final stages of AIDS. She finds it funny that Richard continues to compare her to the fictional character of Clarissa Dalloway, but he may be more than right in doing so. The thing is, he has won a literary prize, and she is preparing a party in his honor. He, like the doomed character Septimus Warren Smith from ""Mrs. Dalloway"", is the tortured soul whose pain, whose madness, is larger than he can bear and in this, the parallels between both writers at the heart of THE HOURS becomes strongly symbolic.",The Hours

The supporting cast also do a good job and I was particularly pleased to see Toni Collette again, though she was hard to recognise in the 50's garb.However, to say this movie is boring, depressing and drags on would be an understatement of monumental proportions. It's a real snore-fest for the most part. Again, these types of movies aren't my thing, so I suppose it was natural my attention would wander. I'm especially glad I wasn't depressed or suicidal myself, as this movie would probably have tipped me over the edge. Not since Aurora have I watched a movie as dull as this one.I don't think the multiple storyline helped. In the first five minutes you are sling-shotted from 40's England to 20's England, to 50's America, then to current day America. All this interspersed with opening credits. Blink, and you'll miss the timeline. I can't help but think that people who enter the theatre ten minutes into the film will be hopelessly confused at this movie.I guess this is more of a chick-flick than anything else, but guys, if you take your girl to see it with the thought in your mind that ""at least I'll get to see the lesbian kissing scenes"" then I'm sorry, but you'll be very disappointed. I've seen heterosexual women kiss each other with more passion than was on display here. Heck. I've seen hetero guys kiss each other with more passion!Other than that, little happens throughout the whole film. Only at the end, when the women reunite, did I find it start to get a tiny bit entertaining. And then it was all over.And what did this movie teach me, if anything? That life is boring and tedious and we all die eventually. Great cinema.Unless you're an art-movie lover I'd give this one a wide berth.",The Hours
51,philip_vanderveken,I never thought the subject 'suicide' could be shown in such a compelling and touching way,8,26 April 2005,"I don't know how it is possible, but I hadn't heard of this excellent movie before watching it. At first I wasn't even all that interested in it, because the story didn't seem all that special to me. But because of all the famous and very good actors that were in it, I gave it a try. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep and Ed Harris are names that you won't find together in the cast of one movie all too often, but here they are. And it was because of these people that I was convinced that I should give it a try.And I must say that I don't regret watching it because the story on itself is already more than just OK. This film tells the story of three women in three different time periods that all, in one way or another, have to deal with suicide and depression in their lives. The first woman is Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) who is starting to write her novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" in 1923, under the care of doctors and family. She's struggling with the fact that she has lesbian feelings and that she isn't happy with her life. Should she go back to London or stay with her loving husband in Richmond? The second woman is Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) who lives in 1951. While she's reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"", she's trying to prepare a wonderful birthday party for her husband. She fears that she isn't a good wife and mother and has to choose between staying miserable with her happy husband and kids or end it all by committing suicide. The third woman is Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) who lives at the present time. One of her friends, the poet Richard who is dieing of aids, has won an important award for his work. She will throw a party for him, but in the meantime she asks herself whether she is in love with him or not (she's a lesbian, but has dated him in the past) and why he is so rude to her.It's wonderful to see how the director and writers have been able to blend all three stories together. In one way or another this seems like only one story even though we clearly get to see three different women from three different generations. Add to this some extra fine acting and some nice music and photography and you know you have a wonderful movie. It's one of those movies that you'll easily remember weeks after you saw it for the first time. Suicide may perhaps not be the most beautiful of all subjects, but the way it is shown in this movie is very touching and compelling and also very beautiful (don't get me wrong, I'm not saying suicide on itself is a beautiful thing). The entire movie really worked very well and it kept me focused from the beginning until the end. I give it a well deserved 8/10. Perhaps even a bit more.",The Hours
52,stensson,Short hours,8,16 April 2003,"You don't feel good after seeing this and you're not supposed to. This is a triumph for Nicole Kidman, acting with her eyes only. There is a sensuality (not sexual) in that performance, which is uncommon in these kind of movies, ""european"" or not ""european"".Julianne Moore acts in another way. It's hard to see her performance towards her son. She is performing in a theatrical way, which is effective, although not that effective as Kidman's act.Watch this. Besides, you'll get rather interested in the literature by Virginia Wolf.",The Hours
53,valadas,It 's sometimes difficult to be alive,7,2 December 2011,"Even if there is no apparent reason to the anguish. This movies tells us the different stories of three women living in different times but united by the same thread: the difficulty to harmonize the world that is within their heads with the world outside which is so much different from the former. The first one is a real character: the famous British novelist Virginia Woolf whose novels depict characters so much like the other two and who has ended up by committing suicide at the age of 58 by drowning herself in a river. There is one of her most famous novels, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" that is over present in the movie since the novelist is precisely writing it at the time and feeling greatly moved and even anguished by that creative work. Of the other two women who lived much later, one is reading the book and the other one is called Mrs. Dalloway by a friend who is a poet and dying of AIDS, probably because he thought that she was much like the character in the novel. Suicide is also present in the other stories in a dramatic way. The image sequences in the movie are constantly crossing themselves, telling the three stories simultaneously thus underlining the similitude of the episodes in the life of the three women and in their states of mind. To appreciate this movie you must be familiar with Virginia Woolf's peculiar sensitivity so well expressed in her novels and the characters she created. This is not a realist movie and rather a movie where just like in her novels the most important feature is the stream of consciousness within the women's minds sometimes shown in acts or words and sometimes by the silence or their face's expressions. The movie direction and the actresses' performance is rather successful in making us feel in tune with it all.",The Hours
54,krocheav,Yes Virginia There Is A Reason...,5,10 July 2016,"Where is best to start with a complex, convoluted work like 'The Hours'? The Novelist Michael Cunningham tends to infuse his own homosexual view of relationships into his characters and the reader. TIME magazine's Richard Schickel's perceptive review of this film version, leans toward being perhaps the most accurate; he summed it up as being; 'Agenda Driven'. Screenplay writer David Hare's jigsaw like adaption makes excellent use of cinematic creativity - allowing bisexual director Stephen Daldry to juxtapose the inter-related time shifts beautifully indeed. It's via this technique we're best able to see director, writer, editor, and photographer, working so perfectly together.David Hare is no stranger to the theme of suicide. His own written and directed (sadly, rarely screened) 1985 classic ""Wetherby"" is testimony to his sensitivity and skill with this subject. As for the variety of interconnected characters, there's an uncomfortable ambiguity that could make it difficult for some viewers to fully connect with them. Firstly, we have Julianne Moore's Laura as a classic example: What earlier goals had this woman set for her life before marriage? She has what billions of less fortunate women the world over would gladly trade places for - a comfortable home, caring husband, an adoring 6 yr old son (marvelously played by young Jack Rovello), a daughter on the way, clothes, car and money to spend.The only solid suggestion the writers offer for her intense suicidal tendencies comes during a visit by Kitty (Toni Collette) her female neighbor - Laura plants a passionate kiss square on the mouth of this very surprised woman - could Laura have been a lesbian all along? - Kitty, who had just finished telling Laura that she feels like a failure because of her inability to conceive, then looks up all doe-eyed at Laura and says 'you're such a warm woman'...surprise! Could it perhaps be that all these years Laura's neighbor may also have been a lesbian?. Perhaps we should look further....A similar excuse is drawn up for Meryl Streep's Clarissa. She's in a lesbian partnership but cannot let go of strong feelings she holds for an old relationship she had with Richard (Richard is the now grown up homosexual son of our above mentioned Laura, and she had abandoned him and his sister years earlier!) This brings to question some theories on same sex partnering...Is Richard really a homosexual or is he simply avoiding a serious relationship with Clarissa (the woman he constantly claims to love), could Richard's indecision be out of fear that Clarissa might also abandon him as his mother did? Is Clarissa in fact a true biological lesbian? None of these issues are convincingly made clear.How many may choose homosexual relationships, not for biological reasons, but from fear or misunderstandings? These choices have the potential to introduce serious dilemmas as people mature into deeper understandings of themselves. Here, we witness their decisions bring deadly consequences for all involved. Even Richard's male lover admits to Clarissa that he never felt freer than the day he left him! So, what does poor Richard get out of all this? - deadly AIDs and yet more suicide!This brings us to the unfortunate writer of the original novel (Mrs Dalloway) Virginia Woolf; (nicely played by a near unrecognizable Nicole Kidman) If we look back over Woolf's life, she has tragically admitted she and her sister were abused by their half brothers ~ She was totally devastated by the death of her parents and brother ~ She also had a lesbian dalliance that soon petered out ~ In the film, Virginia goes on to admit the only time she ever felt fulfilled and at her happiest - was in her relationship with her beloved husband. Yet again, the novelist (Cunningham) rather bizarrely seems to be offering up suggestions that a lesbian relationship might still be her possible saviour. Somehow this all has a tendency to look and feel like over-simplistic agenda based reasoning - rather than genuine relationship philosophy.With stylish direction by Stephen Daldry ~ marvelous editing by Peter Boyle (AKF '92's neglected ""Into the West"") ~ dressed to the hilt with so many stunning performances (too difficult to say who's best) ~ then add Irish born director of photography Seamus McGarvey (known for the odd 'Harry Dean Stanton Partly Fiction') providing dazzling images ~ now wrap it all up in Philip Glass's haunting, insistently minimalist but melodic music score. What you end up with, could be one of the most compelling movies that you just may find all too difficult to watch again. The films surprising success could be attributed to all the above elements but, there have been many other powerful, introspectively themed movies that were unfairly neglected, why? The Hours could prove rewarding for those who can take the intensity - for others; the seconds, minutes and hours might possibly seem like weeks.",The Hours

Her performance was just incredible and you won't even recognize her.

It is basically 3 story lines with the loose ends tied up at the end.Ed Harris turns in another fine performance as a man dying of AIDS and Meryl Streep as a woman slowly beginning to realize she has to live for herself and not for others is wonderful.

Watching it all these years later it just completely blows me away. Directed by Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot) and based on the bestseller. The Hours tells the epic tale of three women living in separate decades but connected. Nicole Kidman stars as Virginia Wolf the amazing writer who suffered from a deep depression that rules her days and nights. Julianne Moore is a housewife in the 50s obligated to her husband and hiding her true self and sexuality. Meryl Streep stars as a woman in a lesbian relationship organizing a party for her dying friend. The movie links their stories as they go through each day trying desperately to survive for the people they love. It's an amazing, epic, powerful film that explores a story we've never seen. Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Ed Harris deliver award worthy performances. But the film belongs to a mesmerizing Nicole Kidman who deservedly won the Academy Award. Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, John C. Reilly, Toni Colette and Jeff Daniels also make for a solid supporting cast.Budget: $25M

58,KUAlum26,"One does not ENJOY this film, one endures it",6,6 March 2006,"The film adaptation of Michael Cunningham's novel which was,itself,a re-fitting of Virginia Woolf's ""Mrs.Dalloway"",is certainly not a bad enough film to be reviled,but it is hardly an enjoyable or rewarding experience.The film is told in contrasts:1923 rural England,1951 Los Angeles and 2001(pre-9/11?)New York City. Three stories:the authoress herself(Nicole Kidman,maddeningly effective and brittle),losing her grip on herself as she lives her days in a quiet English village doing her writing;a pretty but forlorn housewife and mother(Julianne Moore,so subtle and quiet here,one fears the whole movie will pass before you know what is plaguing her)who desperately wants to make a cake for her husband's birthday;and a middle-aged poet(Meryl Streep,frayed)who frets over her dying best friend,a fellow writer(Ed HArris,who actually about steals his scenes here MHO). The stories take place over about the course of a regular day;not quite twenty four hours,about(I'm guessing)6 or 7 a.m. until about 11 p.m.,and the situations become similar,actions being in synchronicity and a couple of common threads that connect all three stories. I don't believe I'm giving TOO much away in the fact that at least three common themes seem to be interlocked into the characters:suicide,homosexuality(perceived,repressed or real)and depression.This film is,to me,almost exclusively worthy of a look on the strength of the actors involved. Even though Kidman won her Oscar for this film,this flick is a very effective showcase for Kidman,Streep,Harris,John C.Reilly(as Moore's pleasant but oblivious husband),JAck Morello(as Moore and O'Reilly's son),Stephen Dillane(as Virginia's husband) and Toni Collette(as Moore's well-coiffed,aloof friend) give weight and impact to their performances. But this film is a tough sit-through: it stresses mood heavily,and as a result,this film is a somber meditation of lives that want to live in the present,the ""Hours"" of the title.In retrospect,I'm glad I did not spend money to see this film.

59,Cosmoeticadotcom,Bad,4,19 September 2008,"The 1951 tale follows another dumb woman who is inspired by the book, Mrs. Dalloway, & ostensibly sees it as a guide to good living. This is the repressive post-War 50s & all the clichés are in place- the smart, precocious- yet emotionally fragile- son, Richard Brown, his doting but clueless dad Dan (the ubiquitous John C. Reilly), & the mother & housewife Laura (Julianne Moore) who is adored by both males, yet loathes them. She is pregnant, again, dealing with her incipient lesbianism (she plants an erotic kiss on female neighbor, Kitty- Toni Collette- who has cancer surgery that day), resents her husband's impudence for having a birthday, thereby forcing her to make a cake- even though he does not ask for 1, & actually does things for her on his birthday. The climax of this tale is LB's suicide attempt. She drops little Richard off at a neighbor's house. This is depicted in the film as an act of neglect & great & needless suffering for the boy, who turns inward to play with Lincoln Logs- only after a slow motion run to the curb to scream for Mommy as she drives away. VW, in her revery, almost kills LB, but refrains, implying that this tale parallels the plot of Mrs. Dalloway- which I've not read. That tale ends with her husband's asking her to come to bed. Of course, this is portrayed as the final straw for LB- she must escape this hell.The 2001 tale dovetails with the 1951 tale. In this story we follow the character of Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep in the worst, most bathetic, performance I've ever witnessed from her). CV is a lesbian who pines for award-winning poet & AIDS victim Richard Brown- yes, little Richard from the 1951 tale. He is played by Ed Harris. He lives in a sewer of an artistic loft, looks emaciated, ready to die, & as a poet- of course- is self-centered, narcissistic, uncaring, etc. He & CV were lovers for 1 summer years earlier, he gave her the pet name of Mrs. Dalloway, then he left her for a man, got AIDS & became the wretch we see. Of course, CV is an emotional wreck, her partner Sally Lester (Allison Janney) cheats on her, she is planning a party for Richard's winning a prestigious poetry prize (more echoes of VW's novel), she has an emotional breakdown when Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters (Jeff Daniels)- the man he left her for- comes early to the party, then witnesses a drugged-out Richard commit suicide by jumping out his window. Despite all the trappings of a feminist lesbian fantasy life- she's a rich, powerful editrix at a publishing house, has a much younger lover, a daughter, Julia, from in vitro fertilization (the terminally winsome Claire Danes), & time aplenty to party & socialize- she's really a wretch who desires the love of the man she lost- who naturally is gay. Still, wait for the used DVD to be marked down at Blockbuster, because for the same price as your average movie ticket, at least you'll probably get some laughable justifications for the film's inanities on the commentaries, as well as some sort of documentary about the real VW & Mrs. Dalloway.",The Hours
60,mstomaso,A very literary film with deep and vast performances,9,1 July 2005,"This is one of those rare films which has me wavering between a 9 and a 10 out of 10. I selected '9' for one reason, and I have to admit that my reason is not entirely fair to the film. To put it bluntly, I am a bit tired of books about writers, books about writing, and films about writing and writers. The self-referential sub-genre of fine fiction is, in my opinion, over-played and has begun to become pretentious and lazy.Nevertheless, I can say with equal honesty that The Hours is a masterpiece of dark literary melodrama. It is NOT AT ALL pretentious, but rather true to its subjects and incredibly well crafted. As with many post-modern melodramas, there are several simultaneous multi-layered plots representing several different time periods. A good popular example of this story-telling technique is the film Magnolia, which also shares a few cast members with The Hours. The themes all seem connected by a single thread - that of depression and suicide. Two of the main characters (Harris and Kidman) are well-respected writers who feel incarcerated in their lives (Kidman plays Virginia Woolf and Harris a fictional poet with AIDS). There are several additional connections, some subtle some not, most focused on the writing of Virginia Woolf, which are revealed as the film progresses. The fact that the connections between the plots are largely unnecessary and irrelevant to the main plot and yet compelling is testimony to the power of the story-telling and the masterful acting, scripting and directing.There is little sense in writing a plot summary for this film - the story evolves out of the profound and evocative characterizations explored in each part, so a plot summary would be as superfluous as a list of character attributes. One of the best casts I have ever seen is not at all wasted on this disturbing yet very true material. Philip Glass' soundtrack is nice, but might be a bit too repetitive to bear several viewings.This is a film for people who do not see film as simple entertainment, but it's not a film which will bring sweetness and light to your heart. It might be a good one to see with somebody you really love, and who you might want to know a bit better than you do. It will certainly seed discussion.

62,brchthethird,A melancholic rumination on suicide,7,17 October 2015,"Why do people kill themselves? That is one of the central questions/themes that THE HOURS explores. Unfolding across three different time periods, this film tells the story of how the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" affects different women who have had to deal with suicide (or suicidal thoughts) in their lives. It stars Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf (who wrote ""Mrs. Dalloway""), Julianne Moore as Laura, and Meryl Streep as Clarissa. Virginia Woolf, who has some mental health issues, is mostly confined to a country home with her husband and writes ""Mrs. Dalloway"" as a way to cope with her situation. Laura is a 1950's suburban housewife who, despite her external appearance, is very unhappy with her boring life. And then there's Clarissa, who is in a committed lesbian relationship and is planning a party for her writer friend Richard, who is also dying of AIDS. All three women have similar stresses and one of the strong points of the film is the way it seamlessly moves between each time period while still telling a unified story. It also deals with some weighty themes that will give you a lot to ponder aside from the key issue of suicide. Among these are social pressures and expectations, selflessness versus selfishness, what makes a person happy, etc. The acting supporting these elements was also top-notch, as would be expected from the outstanding cast, and each of the three lead actresses gets a scene in which to shine. I should also mention Philip Glass' score, which I was actually familiar with prior to seeing the film. I felt like his music was perfectly suited to the material, accurately conveying the sense of isolation, melancholy, and ennui common to all three of the central characters. However, the film's structure is partly its undoing, although not disastrously so. A lot of the dialogue is pretty on-the-nose, and the juxtaposition of scenes basically tells the audience how they should interpret what they're seeing rather than let them figure things out on their own. Still, the repetition of key dialogue from different characters and using match cuts to transition between time periods was an effective way to unify the narrative, as well as provide needed continuity. When it comes down to it, THE HOURS is a very well-made and well-acted film that deals with heavy themes and emotions, even if in a slightly pretentious way. This isn't a film I can see watching that often, if even a second time, but the potential for discussion and/or self-assessment makes this definitely worth seeing.",The Hours

She KNOWS he's got AIDS. She knows her man-friend is near death from terminal AIDS contracted from this man. She doesn't love this man, she just hops in the sack for approximately the same emotion involved in lighting a cigarette or popping open a beer. How stupid. How irresponsible to write into a book or movie.I've known many guys who were low-down, stupid, or irresponsible; but never one who'd knowingly have sex with a woman having a sexually transmitted disease.I've personally watched two friends die horrible deaths from terminal AIDS.

Not that the material is inappropriate for teenagers or young adults, the material is too deep, too mature. It's for people who have lived a while, experienced life, and want to see its profounder, more complex elements explored on film. That's what ""The Hours"" is about. It addresses subjects like the limits of commitment and loving, the conflicts of having to chose between loved ones and yourself, depression and suicide, and the meaning of dying.  It tackles them head on.The screenplay is terrific, jumping between three parallel stories separated by 80 years. There's Virginia Woolf in seclusion with her husband in the English countryside of 1923; Laura, the suburban housewife in 1951 southern California; and Clarissa in 2001 Manhattan.

69,Pedro_H,Recommended only to those that want to holiday in someone else's misery.,6,24 November 2004,"Three sets of very different lives - in very different times and places - are affected by mental illness and even suicide.The kind of film that wins bucket-loads of awards because it pleases the people that vote for awards (middle class art snobs with unhappy marriages/relationships) and features that ever popular theme of ""success stories"" feeling utter failures in their own heart. With that equally popular rider: arty folk being more sensitive than the rest of the populous.At this point I usually I go in to the plot and some of the developments, but frankly it isn't worth it. The drama, while believable, is hardly new and original (man dying of AIDS - can't these people buy a medical dictionary and find something else to die of!) and features a lot what is known in the trade as ""natural light"" - which reads darkness or gloom to you and me.The only real clever thing is that weaves the different stories together well, letting you feel that you are watching one film and not three. Which must have seemed a real danger pre-production. Sadly they all share a sense of contrived melancholy which I can live without. Real depression often features yo-yo emotions (the best inside writer on the subject is, strangely, Winston Churchill who talks of his famous ""black dog"") but this confuses Hollywood who prefer the kind of flat version on display here. (The Best Picture Oscar winner Ordinary People - directed by Robert Redford - was one of the few films to explore the subject of depression with true dimensions.) Let me quickly add that I admire plenty of the acting talents on show (although Nicole Kidman looks nothing like Virginia Woolf - even with her putty nose and horrible baggy dresses), but they have all had better parts.I am not saying there isn't clever observation of life and truths here - but I see real life and truths from my window. Indeed I see a balance of life which this film lacks - there may be a sunny of the street, but this film has no time for it.(Although the famous Roger Ebert of the Chicago Times thought he saw a funny moment which had slipped by me unnoticed.)From our school days we know all about the overrated Ginny Woolf (a writer that has gone through many critical revisions - especially post-feminism) and what she did down by the River Ouse, but I hate her well cultivated elitism - that extended right down to her chosen method of self-inflicted death. Choosing a slow and difficult death to show ""she really meant it"", even in suicide she is trying to score points!I came to this film trying to like it and give it a chance - but it never dragged me in. At one point I did actually jump, because something dramatic happened, but that was just a fluke brought on by boredom.It is interesting to read so many positive reviews that suggest that while rating it highly they didn't really enjoy watching it. Rather in the saw way as some critics judged Best Picture Oscar Winners The Last Emperor and Ordinary People. I thought that was what cinema was about? Enjoying it. Well outside the films that have some strong educational core.",The Hours
70,EijnarAmadeus,Considerably intelligent gloom,8,6 December 2010,"THE HOURS is a meandering drama about three women (Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep) of three different times, all living lives under the influence of ""Mrs. Dalloway"", a fictional character in a fictional novel. The film feels gray and heavy-minded throughout, and all the depression that it indulges into occasionally makes it a difficult watch. The thing that makes it worthwhile through its slow paces is the quite memorable soundtrack, and off course as mentioned by many, the great performances (especially by Kidman, Moore and Ed Harris as Streep's dying friend); I've never been a huge fan of Kidman's work, but her performance as author Virginia Woolf is very good as her physical change is a simple invitation into the talented writer's troubled mind. This may not be anyone's pick for Saturday entertainment, but it's a solid and imaginatively told film.",The Hours
71,FloatingOpera7,"A Powerful Movie About One Day, Three Lives",10,27 February 2005,"Well tonight is Oscar Night and may the best movie win. In honor of today's event, I'm looking back at this great film which sadly lost to Chicago (of all things) back in 2002. This film was definitely the Best Picture that year, but either mainstream audiences of the Academy found Chicago to be the darling that year. While that film was campy and silly, this movie is serious, powerful and deeply moving. It stars Nicole Kidman, who took home the Oscar for Best Actress, in the tragic role of writer Virginia Woolf, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep. Based on the book, the story follows the course of one day in the life of three very different women suffering from a sort of depressing despair. While this film can easily be made into a play (which I believe it has already) the visuals in this film make it haunting and enhance the powerful content. There are subtle things that tell us bigger concerns. The frustration of baking a cake, her unhappy marriage, Virginia Woolf's neurosis and schizophrenia, her desperate attempt at a normal life, and the poor man suffering of AIDS, is too much to handle sometimes. But the way they made this film is so real, so moving, that we feel that we value our lives all the more.""Why must somebody die ?,"" asks a curious boy to the writer Virginia Woolf when she decides to kill of one of her characters, ""because..we value our lives all the more,"" she replies. This is the theme, this and the lines Woolf speaks as she drowns herself in the river...""Always the distance between us...always the hours..."". When I came home from watching this movie, I did feel a sense of appreciation for every hour of my life. We live, we survive, for each other. People in our live depend on our sanity, our support and our compassion. This film deserved the Oscar. If that Oscar Night could play itself again......",The Hours
72,Superunknovvn,More than an average movie,8,25 April 2004,"""The Hours"" is an extremely intelligent movie. It's deep and sensitive and the script is something different for a change. The acting couldn't get any better. EVERY role was casted perfectly. I never really liked Nicole Kidman but she is a fantastic actress and at the moment she just chooses the right roles. She definitely deserved the Oscar. Juliane Moore is amazing, too. I wonder if there is any genre she can't do. And then, there's Meryl Streep. Will this woman ever stop being great? I mean after all the great movies she's been in in the 80's, she's still making exceptional films such as ""Adaptation"" and ""The Hours"", whereas other actors who were great 10 years ago pretty much lost it today *cough*Pacino*cough*DeNiro*cough, cough*. The director did a wonderful job and the score is another big plus of this movie. The haunting music underlines the depressing all around atmosphere and lets one feel how miserable these main characters are all the time. At times I felt like these women's sadness was explained too little, though. Maybe that's manly ignorance but I couldn't totally figure out why Juliane Moore's character was so depressed all the time. It was a little annoying that she never stopped crying and you couldn't tell why. I paid attention and I did try reading between the lines but that was a mystery to me. Probably just a personal problem. All in all I think this is the 2nd best movie of 2003's Oscar movies (1st being ""The Pianist"", 3rd ""About Schmidt"").",The Hours
73,lawprof,"""Why is everything so difficult?""",10,19 January 2003,"""Why is everything so difficult?"" asks Clarissa (Meryl Streep), a question that at once sharpens the unifying theme of three women in different times facing - ultimately  - some very common questions about destiny versus choice and interdependence versus what may be an ersatz sense of individual freedom.  ""The Hours"" reaches a level of haunting depth.Virginia Woolf (lustrously played by Nicole Kidman in a performance that adumbrates her future as one of our greatest actresses) wrote a novel about ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  That novel became the centerpiece of an excellent 1997 film by that name.  Here, aided by her loving but exasperated husband, Woolf, born several generations too soon for medicine to control her madness without curtailing her genius, begins to write the book.  She is trapped in the ""anesthetic"" blandness of a suburb where she is virtually a prisoner by her doctor's orders.  She longs to return to London, a metaphor for creative and cultured life (as any great city is).Laura (back into the suburbs for Julianne Moore, again most effectively) wrestles with her internal disaffection with life in a California suburb with her doting and devoted husband and lovely little boy.  The boy's insight into his mom's sadness, unvoiced but palpable, contrasts with her husband's blind ""our world is perfect"" attitude.  Meryl Streep is Clarissa, formerly heterosexual or bisexual, now in the tenth year of a happy union in Manhattan with her female partner. She is so sure of herself it's a seismic shock when she begins to wonder why she can't control a floodgate of tears as she prepares a gala party as only Manhattanites can.Clair Danes in a brief role as Clarissa's daughter, Julia, makes a welcome return to the screen after a hiatus.What do these fascinating women have in common?  As the decades are seamlessly and beautifully intertwined through director Stephen Daldry's sensitive vision, Virginia starts the novel, Laura reads it and Clarissa is addressed as ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her former lover and lifelong friend, dying poet Richard (Ed Harris).  Flowers are a subtle motif for all the women, a symbol of an untainted and simple beauty.Ed Harris as Richard, poet and author, is chillingly real as a brilliant man watching his life slip away day by day to the inexorable ravages of advanced AIDS.  One of our finest actors, his face - alternating between mischievous self-mocking and tortured fear and pain - speaks for a legion of lost souls.The film's story is well-known now.  This is a magnificent film in which the three women occupy much the same psychological plane despite their differing times, locales and in some ways merely superficially different lives.Philip Glass's score I must admit (I am not a fan of this composer's usually minimalist works) is very effective.More words are unnecessary - see it! 10/10.",The Hours
74,khatcher-2,Complex. Provocative. Disturbing = Brilliant,9,25 April 2003,"'Unhappiness is everywhere; just beyond the door; or stupidity, which is worse' (Virginia Woolf)The only novel I have read by Virginia Woolf is 'To the Lighthouse', which, evidently, bears quite a lot of light on the complex characteriology of the authoress, already manifest two years earlier in her novel 'Mrs. Dalloway'. In either of these two works it is clear that Virginia Woolf sought to reach the deepest, innermost feelings of human beings, whilst trying to remain distant from such pathos: therein lies part of the suffering of this rather tormented woman, ending in her being somewhat depressive. However, she commanded literary skills of far-reaching importance - especially for women in the years following her publications - due to her vivid imagination, sensitivity and that curious condition limited to a few post-Edwardian Britons called wit. Not sparkling wit, but that wit which gets down into your bowels and scrapes around forcing that hard-felt spontaneous reaction. However, Virginia Woolf disliked the Edwardian legacy in literature.Thus, Michael Cunningham, in his novel based on 'Mrs. Dalloway' and the life of Virginia Woolf, has done a remarkable job in tying up three parallel lives in different periods of time with a coherent linking up of feelings and fortunes which goes way beyond the circumstantial or the coincidental.From here, Stephen Daldry takes over. I have only recently been able to see 'Billy Elliot' (qv), which is certainly an interesting film, and well made, but merely pales into insignificance almost beside 'The Hours'. This British born director hopped the Atlantic, got together some of the best-known names of US film-making and dealt out a severe lesson to our dear friends on the other side of the Atlantic on how to make films.The first is that you are not making good films by getting together a few well-known names, and the box-office does the rest. US cinema is fraught with such failures. However many times you put Richard Gere with some lovely-looking female, you are not necessarily going to produce anything that stands out from the great big heap of trivialities.Nicole Kidman has not played a better part in her life, as only in 'The Portrait of a Lady' (qv) as Isabel Archer does she come anywhere near her performance in 'The Hours'. If anyone had asked me who could play Virginia Woolf, it would not have occurred to me to think of Nicole Kidman: but her interpretation is faultless. Verging on brilliance that goes beyond mere comparisons.Meryl Streep has played many significant roles, among the best of which might be in 'Kramer vs Kramer' (qv), 'Sophies Choice', 'Out of Africa', 'The House of The Spirits' (qv), 'The Bridges of Madison County' and almost passing over 'Music of the Heart'; if I must make any one of these stand out it would be 'Sophies Choice'. However, in 'The Hours' she has reached new levels of interpretation, getting beyond everything else she has previously made.As for Julianne Moore, her appearances in such films as The Hand that Rocks the Cradle', 'Cookies Fortune', 'Magnolia' (qv) (I prefer not to include 'Hannibal') have been interesting, even good playing, but in none of these films does she reach such depths in bringing to life a character in a film as here in 'The Hours'.Just the simple fact that Stephen Daldry brought together three of the big names of Hollywood today and the three of them probably gave their best interpretative skills, is enough in itself to suggest that this Dorsetshire man is a genius of the first order. No gimmicks; no terrible special effects: just good (superb) dramatization which holds the intelligent spectator spellbound.If that was not enough, Toni Collette as Kitty is magnificent, and Ed Harris just goes way beyond anything he has ever done in any film - and I include 'A Magnificent Mind'. Miranda Richardson is as good or better than in anything else I have seen of her.Whoever had the idea of incorporating Philip Glass's music into this film should be given a free life-pension in a luxury hotel on Bahamas. The score is absolutely magnificent. I have been keen on his music ever since 'The Photographer', and with this film my interest has been rekindled.I feel a little ashamed to say such silly things but: here is one of the most moving, brilliant pieces of film-making to have come onto the screen in the last 300 years. This film is pure essence, getting down to the real fibres of human existence. Stephen Daldry should be knighted, by whomsoever might be on the British Crown at the necessary moment. 'The Hours' is a crowning achievement, a work of art, simply a cinematographic masterpiece. Watch it five or six times, and you will see what I mean.No accolade is too great for this impressive accomplishment.",The Hours
75,WriterDave,Extremely well made but with questionable motives...,6,4 March 2003,"These are the three morals I took home from 'The Hours', one of those extremely well made but contrived literary movies that is almost too thought provoking and ultimately depressing. (POTENTIAL SPOILERS)1. Creative and imaginative people must become martyrs (both writers in this film commit suicide) so that the neurotic people around them can appreciate life more. This is both incredibly stupid and morally offensive. 2. There is a link between madness and homosexuality (or more generally, the repression of one's true desires). This is an extremely dangerous sentiment and wide open for debate. 3. Generations connect through art (in this case the written word). This is true, and the only 'nice' thing to take away from this tripe.The morals of the film aside, it is lovingly directed, beautifully scored (alas I am a fan of minimalist composer Glass), and wonderfully acted. The script for me was too contrived and there were too many 'poetic' monologues from depressed people facing down death. Also, despite a great performance from Kidman, I did not feel like her character Virginia Wolf was explored thoroughly or treated fairly, which is a shame since the real Wolf was no doubt an utterly fascinating woman worthy of her own film. Also, the best acting overall ironically came from the little boy playing Julianne Moore's son. I have never seen a more accurate and heartbreaking portrayal of how young children will internalize their parent's suffering, even when that suffering is never clearly expressed by the parent. Also, he is a poster child for unhealthy attachment. All he wants is some validation from his mother and a little bit of affection, but since she in incapable of giving that to him, he doesn't have any faith in her and can't trust her to be there for him, which is why he throws the tantrum when she drops him off at the babysitter (he also perhaps somehow sensed that she wanted to leave him for good). Kudos to the kid who is obviously a natural and for Daldry for directing these scenes so well. However, the plot twist at the end that connects the separate stories all too nicely did not satisfy me. I did not believe that this child would grow up and become who he did.With its questionable morals and intentions, I can not in good faith recommend this film. It is thought provoking, challenging, and well made (I would rather sit through this than most of the crap Hollywood stuffs the cineplexes with), but in the end I felt sickened by this odious endeavor. For a better look at how madness can affect a creative mind, see the 'Iris.' For a better look at the creative process of writing, see 'Adaptation.' For a more subtle and uplifting movie about human suffering that is neither contrived nor untrue, see 'The Pianist.' In the end I would rather spend my 'Hours' reading a book.",The Hours
76,ruby_fff,A literary filmic masterpiece - the art of living - life lessons in the moment.,8,20 January 2003,"I have noticed the poster of The Hours long before the film's release, and was intrigued by the unrecognizable face of Nicole Kidman. The trailer so visually well-edited together - juxtaposing three women stories side by side, with Philip Glass' music really stayed with me. Seemed an interminable wait trying to see the film at its year-end pre-release, so I picked up the soundtrack - couldn't wait! The haunting Glass compositions, the movements, the piano notesprompted me to read about Virginia Woolf, learn of Cunningham's book and background, and checked out the official Web site for more. When I finally did get to see the film, I was very satisfied - it turned out as I expected: superb all 'round. It's a literary sight and sound and words. From the integral approach of overlapping poetry and psychology, we have (Virginia) Woolf's words, (Michael) Cunningham's book and (David) Hare's screenplay richly delivered under the direction of Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot 2000). Do not be fooled by the appearance of things: there are suspense and disbelief, human drama unfolding, gamut of emotions and realizations coming full circle with perhaps a surprise or two that'd catch you unaware.A thoughtful production of people, time and place. It's the art of living, of life lessons in the moment. Fascinating collaborative performances and pairings of actors: Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Woolf (in the 20s UK), Julianne Moore as Mrs. Brown (in the 50s LA), Meryl Streep as 'Mrs. Dalloway' (in the 90s NY), and Miranda Richardson as Woolf's sister Vanessa, Toni Colette as Brown's neighbor Kitty, Allison Janney as Streep's partner Sally, with Stephen Dillane as Leonard Woolf, John C. Reilly as Brown's husband, Ed Harris as Richard - Streep's reason for party and flowers, not forgetting young Jack Rovello as Richie, the son to Moore's Laura Brown, and Jeff Daniels, Claire Danes brief appearances opposite Streep. The music by Philip Glass is very much a character in the film, moving the three stories along. The cinematography treatment of the three different worlds is captured by Seamus McGarvey, with seamless film editing mastered by Peter Boyle, and challenging costume design of the various periods by the omnipotent Ann Roth.The soundtrack CD package is also well-conceived, it came with a booklet that presented excerpt passages from Cunningham's book. Check out the official Web site: www.thehoursmovie.com. Thanks to the wisdom of Scott Rudin Production, with the support of Paramount Pictures and Miramax Films.

79,TaylorYee94,It's sad that one finds the meaning of life at the cost another's death.,8,13 February 2021,"Virginia Woolf in the movie has to kill one from her novel for others to 'value life more'. Life & Death had always been the matter of God till I watched 'The Hours'. To be honest, I have not given too much thought on 'death' in every day life. It come when it comes but not imminent or artificial; nobody can control it. However, after watching this movie, I ask 'Can one CHOOSE life or death? Is it a matter of free will / choice / human's matter (whatever you call it)?' Virginia and Richard choose death despite caring, support, and persuasion from others, and Laura Brown chooses life even though she had to abandon her loving and giving family. Also, 'Is someone more prone to death while another more prone to life?' Leonard Woolf, Julia Vaughan, and Kitty are positive, vivid, and progressive while their counterparts cannot get out of the swam of death and depression even though they are in similar environments as their counterparts. All these philosophical thoughts and questions keep rising, which tells the movie is very inspiring and thought-provoking. However, in the perspective of entertainment value, this melancholy movie talks about death and suicide for two hours, and three unhappy female protagonists are full of complaints of their lives. Despite all the disadvantages, the story, the thoughts, and the mind have been restless for the whole time, keeping me focused. This is possible because of creative structure of the movie. All three women interconnected with the medium of the novel 'Mrs. Dalloway' and all three women going through similar problems, day (party, important day, and etc.), and life is such a brilliant idea. It happens across the time and also suggest universality of depression regardless of era. Very well-made with meticulous and deliberate organization.",The Hours
80,majikstl,A twist in time,6,5 March 2004,"THE HOURS takes place in three different times, in three different locations and focuses on three different women. The three stories are all different in content, but contain shared elements. Even so, it becomes frustrating trying to figure out what the director and the screenwriter had in mind when they linked and innercut the three diverse storylines. The only common denominator is the book ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by Virginia Woolfe. One of the stories deals with the woman who wrote it, another with a woman who read it, and another who is living it. But nothing really relates -- until the end.It is only at the end when it becomes suddenly apparent how these women's lives connect and how the story really isn't about any of them. THE HOURS, like MEMENTO and THE SIXTH SENSE, is one of those films that truly has a twist ending, but earns the right to it's final surprise. The film never lies, never misleads, but never reveals more than it has to. The twist forces you to reevaluate all that has come before. The twist is the film's saving grace. The three stories, in and of themselves, are a bit hard to take.Nicole Kidman's Oscar-winning turn as Woolfe is competent enough, but the character's moody, self-destructive nature make it difficult to care one way or the other. She is defined only by her developing mental illness, which makes the character somewhat one-dimensional. Fairing worse is Julianne Moore as a 1950's Los Angles housewife on the verge of not only having a nervous breakdown, but on the edge of damaging her six year old son in the process. The film strives to make her seem vulnerable and sympathetic, but instead she seems cold and self-absorbed. As her thread unwinds, the viewer is likely to be more interested in the child than the mother. In the final narrative Meryl Streep plays a bustling, contemporary New Yorker trying to juggle her relationship with her lesbian partner with caring for her AIDS-stricken best friend, a cynical poet played by Ed Harris.On their own, these three psychodramas are of only passing interest: it is only the final scenes that gives them depth and poignancy. The film's twist is the film's genius, but alas, it is also it's fatal flaw. The ""a-ha!"" factor reveals the film's narrative to be one long, albeit clever, gimmick. A twist ending should underscore the meaning of all that proceeds it, not be the sole justification for the story's existence.",The Hours
81,gsygsy,Cause for pride,9,18 November 2015,"A bravura piece of screen writing by David Hare is the foundation on which this remarkable cinematic edifice is built. It is peopled by actors of the highest quality. Several of its images are truly haunting. Many of its scenes are tremendously powerful.The story concerns lives in different decades linked by Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs Dalloway. It's essentially a literary idea, based as it is on a book by Michael Cunningham. But Hare, director Stephen Daldry and their colleagues turn it into a poetic study of life and death. It is given urgency and unity by Philip Glass's score.The Hours aims high and mostly achieves what it sets out to do, but there are, perhaps inevitably, a couple of fumbles. A climactic scene between two of its leading actors is presented in a series of ever tighter close-ups, which ends up giving the impression that the characters might not be in the same room. If that was the idea, it was a mistake - we really need to feel them communicating, sharing the space. Also, one of the story strands feels much more contrived than the others, shoe-horned in to make it all work: this is, I'm pretty sure, a problem in the source material which the movie couldn't avoid inheriting.In the final analysis, these are quibbles. To embark on a project as ambitiously multi-layered as this in a commercial movie, and then to realise it as fully as The Hours does, is quite an achievement.

Virginia Woolf's literary genius was always paralleled by her bouts with depression and her repressed homosexuality, creating an awkward relationship with her long suffering husband.Living a similar life of emotional and sexual imprisonment is the 1950s suburban mother and housewife (very convincingly played by the Oscar Nominated Julianne Moore), with yet another character struggling with very similar issues in contemporary New York (played by Meryl Streep).The three ""lives and times"" are intertwined into one story, each offering hope for a better life for those who would come after. Difficult to watch, and even more difficult to keep up with, ""The Hours"" is a tribute to all who have struggled and conquered their feelings of depression and the pressures applied by a society not quite ready to accept anyone with sexual feelings for members of the same gender. Perhaps in another 20 years, a fourth character could emerge, showing the world that depression can be managed, and being gay never was a problem to begin with.",The Hours

85,bix171,Has Its Moments,7,7 March 2003,"Three loosely related stories dealing with varying degrees of depression are handled with exactly the same relentlessly somber tone in Stephen Daldry's adaptation of Michael Cunningham's novel (unread by this reviewer). Each story takes place in one day during different eras: the first deals with Virginia Woolf (a very fine Nicole Kidman who keeps an appropriate distance) in 1923 as she works on `Mrs. Dalloway', the novel that serves as the film's framework; another, taking place in 1951, deals with a young, pregnant housewife (Julianne Moore, a bit too mannered) whose husband (John C. Reilly) is oblivious to the struggle that is keenly observed by her young son; the third is set in modern times as a woman (Meryl Streep) tends to her AIDS-stricken ex-lover (Ed Harris) for whom she is planning a party to celebrate a major award for his poetry. Daldry directs with too much limp sensitivity and restraint; for much of the running time, it's flat and frustrating, forcing you to pick your spots of interest while subjecting you to long stretches of monotony. But Daldry and screenwriter David Hare find their way to a graceful conclusion, with its eloquent thoughts about happiness and a subtle yet dignified case for suicide. The powerhouse cast also includes Toni Collette, Stephen Dillane, Claire Danes and Jeff Daniels, convincing in a brief role as another of Harris' ex-lovers. The score is by Philip Glass and it's one of his most accessible works, to the point of being overdramatic.",The Hours
86,brenttraft,The Tragedy of Baking a Cake,10,9 February 2003,"If you have read any of the other reviews on this page, you have probably figured out ""The Hours"" is not the easy, mainstream film it was made out to be by the ads and the reviews.  Starring three of today's most popular leading actresses, winner of some Golden Globe awards, based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, and the recipient of numerous rave reviews; it would seem to be a film that would appeal to a lot of people.""The Hours"" is not a regular Hollywood type of drama film. It has more in common with Ingmar Bergman films than with ""Terms of Endearment.""  I think the thing that most people are having problems with is that the film does not explain what takes place or the significance of the context of what takes place.  Things happen and it is up to the viewer to decide what it means.  This is a controversial film and people will not only argue about whether or not the film is worthwhile, but they can also debate what exactly takes place during the film.  How a person interprets this film says more about the person than the film.The film follows a single day in the lives of three women in different time periods.  During this day, each of them makes a decision that will affect the rest of their life.I felt the film improved upon the book by bringing more clarity into the decisions of each character.  Also, some of the most memorable lines and scenes in the film did not exist in the book.While I would normally be the last person in the world to say anything positive about Phillip Glass, his score is evocative of the relentlessness of time.  This is accentuated by the ticking of the clock throughout the film.  The ethereal music also helps tie the three storylines together, to make it seem as if they are happening simultaneously.I think a lot of people were taken off-guard by this film because they were expecting a more standard type of drama.  Also, the PG-13 rating implies a lighter subject matter than is actually in the film.  Just as a warning: There is crying, suicide, and women kissing women.  Even though the violence and language is mild and there are no sex or nudity in the film, it should have probably been given an R rating because of the extreme emotion displayed in the film.  Emotionally unstable people should probably not see this film.As I said earlier, people will interpret this film differently since things are not spelled out for them.  For the record, I did not think all three women were suffering from clinical depression as suggested by some people. Virginia's malaise would seem to fit the description of schizophrenia rather than clinical depression.  Clarissa was suffering from regret over a decision she made thirty years previous and the feeling that she will never experience that happiness again. That does not necessarily mean she is clinically depressed.  Laura is the depressed one and she makes a decision to handle that depression the way she thinks is best for her.  Also, I do not feel Virginia was either incestuous or a lesbian.  I think she was expressing her desperation through her disease and it came out in a socially unacceptable manner.There is no doubt in my mind that ""The Hours"" is a great film.  I only recommend it to people who are up to the challenge of thinking about the film long after they have left the theater and deciding about what it means. It is not a film for everybody but I felt it was worth the effort.",The Hours

Then let's repeat the same idea through lots of different characters (hence the 3 different stories at different times) so that nobody will miss it.Unfortunately the want to be intellectuals will miss it so we make sure they understand by doing things like nicknaming a character Mrs Dalloway so every ones understands the analogy.Virginia Wolf has never been more boring (and I would suspect very inaccurate).Great acting in a story that is only for people who think they can think but you thought wrong.I admire Nicole Kidman for taking on many different and interesting roles, but I feel that our Nicky (I am an Aussie) needs to find a story and script with a little bit more depth.",The Hours
88,yris2002,Superb acting for a dramatically intense story,10,1 October 2009,"This is a truly great, and artfully made piece of cinema, it belongs to the list of my top-ten favourite movies, one of those movies which, as I like saying, get under your skin and never leave you. As it happens when you talk about something great, words appear to be too limited and limiting, as if unable to fully express such depth. However, it is always worth trying, however partially and inadequately, to explain the reasons for such an appreciation.The three stories are very well developed and finely intertwined until the last final revelation, which I will obviously not mention, even tough the plot is not the most significant element to appreciate in the movie (as well in the novel it is taken from). What impressed me was the capability to follow the development of suffering souls without revealing too much all of a sudden, the touch is accurate, but never obtrusive: if you think of ""The reader"" by the same director, Stephen Daldry, you will recognize the same elegant, detached, attitude, never becoming cerebral but never indulging in the pathetic, in a movie where dramas and conflicts are so deep that it would be very easy to slip into the tearjearking, it is as if every emotion were taken under safe control, and the viewer could be accompanied gradually and safely guided to the discovery of intense dramas.Moreover, I had read the novel and I was surprised to find total adherence to it by the movie, mainly from an emotional point of view, I could rediscover the strong emotions I had felt, being strengthened by a strong visual impact, as if, and it is rare for movies, the cinematographic transposition not only didn't deprive the book of something, but on the contrary was even able to add something to the written word.Pure talent is to be appreciated from the whole cast: Nicole Kidman, deprived of her natural beauty, can eventually be valued for her high-level performance, being it really difficult to interpret one of the most complicated female souls of world's literature, Julianne Moore also hits the sign and Meryl Streep is superb, and usually gives evidence of her being one of the most talented actresses of today. Also Ed Harris acts quite convincingly. In the end, I can only say: read the book and then see this movie, but above all, feel both to the utmost.",The Hours
89,rollernerd,Hello Mrs. Dalloway,8,16 September 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the drama flick The Hours (2002), an epic story which crosses various time periods and three generations during the 20th Century revolving around three very different women battling their inner demons around love, freedom, depression and identity. The film has a stellar cast which bounces back the three main actors who play complex characters. The two characters of whom have been deeply affected by the works of Virginia Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway."" The other woman is Woolf herself who is struggling to write the novel. As the story unfolds, we see how each woman are dealing with their depression.The film stars Julianne Moore as Laura Brown, a depressed and pregnant housewife who reads Woolf's novel in 1949 while she plans her husband's birthday party and in the present time 2002, we have the queen herself Meryl Streep as Clarissa Vaughn, a book editor who is planning a farewell party for her AIDS-inflicted former lover. Then we have Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf.This film is amazing on every level, the acting, the story and the cinematography. Just wow. The whole subject matter about depression really captures you. The actors in this film displayed real emotion and they literally were engaging and interesting through the flick. Even though the film spans over different eras, the filmmakers did a great job in costume design and the sets.The idea of raising the awareness of mental illness really hit me to the core. There are other themes in the flick including sexuality and creative responsibility of one's own existence. Everyone questions the meaning of life and the value of life. Everyone thinks about happiness, and remembers the moment they were happiest. These are all mortal realities. These deep thoughts can create either a positive light to progress and make the most out of life or as we see in the film a disruptive journey. Especially if one is felt trapped and suffocated. This movie will give you a different perspective on how life isn't always beautiful.Great acting by all however the gem of this movie is Kidman's performance as Virginia Woolf. Kidman is brilliant and we can see how she embodies someone who has a perspective on how life isnt beautiful. She is thriving for the communication that connects her sould however she is trapped and suffocated and is a mess. However Kidman still provides a subtle charm that helps you to understand why people found her fascinating. Even though she is confident, everyone thinks she's fine, but she isn't.Great execution by the filmmakers using the concept of making a choice of identify with different film angles in particular when each partner asks the actors to come to bed - brilliant and smart. Hope you movie goers see what I mean. Need to shout out to actor Ed Harris who brings a strong performance of the broken former lover of Streep's character.This flick has powerful themes with many complex characters demonstrating how life isn't an easy feat especially if you are not living the life you thrive for therefore walking on a dark pathway around depression - overall 8.2/10",The Hours
90,Emerenciano,beautiful,8,4 April 2003,"I must confess I thought ""The Hours"" wouldn't be so good when I started watching it. The first minutes are slow (actually the whole movie is) and we think the film is nothing but one more drama. Some time later, Julianne Moore's, Meryl Streep's and Nicole Kidman's performances make we fall in love with the stories. Yes, there are three good stories with a slight but important connection among them: the book written by Virginia Woolf (Kidman). My rate 8/10",The Hours
91,Silverzero,"Elegant, fascinating melodrama invigorates with splendour.",10,19 September 2003,"Diseases? Check. Feministic over-tones? Check. Lesbianism? Check. Meryl Streep? Check. This seems like the perfect recipe for `lurid chick-flick-of-the-week', but `The Hours' is something far deeper and captivating. Two immediate thumbs-up for originality. Not only does David Hare adapt the famous story by Virginia Woolf; he also intertwines two different stories that criss-cross in the most engaging style possible. Each story gets a rousing treatment with an equal proportion of attention divided among them.The first takes us to 1923, New England where mentally unstable novelist Virginia Woolf is writing `Mrs. Dalloway'. In the second, Laura Brown, an unhappy housewife is reading the book in Hollywood in 1951. In the third, Clarissa Vaughn finds herself becoming the character in modern day Manhattan. British director brings the movie depth and meaning as the plots unfold and interact in a thoroughly earnest and believable manner. Of course there are those that complain that the film is made up of a series of `they'll show this clip for my Oscar nomination' moments, but this isn't enough to really hold a grudge against it. Okay, perhaps it is manipulative in that sense but it was hardly intentional.Technical credits are surprisingly terrific all round. In particular, the silky, brazen editing cleverly switches from one scene to the other with the just right amount of emphasis on key elements. Scenery, cinematography and costume designs are spectacular as well. Though hardly breath-taking compared to `Chicago' and `Gangs of New York', the alternating sets are magnificently detailed. Such is the case with the image of Hollywood in 1951. Always sunny and seductive, there is a perfect overbearing of cleanliness in the idyllic household and crystal clear roads.  The solemnities of the plots really go right to the core. The subtext is hidden far enough to consider the film `sophisticated' and every little detail, no matter how irrelevant is chosen for a reason.But the main power is generated by the host of superlative performances. Nicole Kidman of course won an Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf (not to mention the heavy prosthetics). Though the performance is convincing, it is too small to consider in the `Best Actress' category. Meryl Streep gives the expected fine delivery and is as mesmerising as one would come to expect. It must have been tough for Julianne Moore to pull off her part. Mainly because she has played the same variation on the `disillusioned wife' character so many times. But she really makes this role her own, totally different from her character in say, `Magnolia', thus she is a brilliant character actress. Support is noteworthy all across the board from the likes of Miranda Richardson, John C. Reilly and Jeff Daniels; the best supporting turn coming from Ed Harris.Under-rated and often misunderstood, `The Hours' is as subtly commendable as its haunting musical score with a shock ending to achieve the considerable impact. Easily one of the Top 5 best pictures of the year. My IMDb rating: 8.0/10",The Hours
92,jpintar,Overrated,5,24 June 2003,"This is one of those films that come along every year that many critics and award shows will widely overpraise.  Yes, the film has good acting from Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep and it has good moments.  Ironically, I think Nicole Kidman (who won an Oscar for the role) is the weakest link.  I didn't find her Virginia Woolf very interesting even though she is supposed to the main influence over the other characters. Although I admire much about the film, I can only give it 5/10 for its weaknesses.",The Hours
93,Gubby-Allen,"Sadly, for the large part, drivel.",4,18 December 2003,"I applaud the idea behind this film, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way in which it was executed, the acting was terrific from all and the closing scenes were excellent. Unfortunately, it was still one of the dullest and most uneventful films in years. For all the good acting, they were a collection of some of the most painfully unappealing characters ever put to film. The modern day sequence with Streep was the only one of the three threads which retained any interest for the viewer at all. Almost all those in either of the two elder stories were characters that had no redeeming qualities to entice the viewer at all & consequently left you with no feelings for -or interest in- any of them.Having eventually made it to the end of the film after about 4 attempts, it was admittedly worth it as that just about saved the film, but you have to sift through some of the most boring scenes & dislikeable characters imaginable to reach it. Which ironically reminded me of the days I had to study Virginia Woolf's novels.A low 4/10",The Hours
94,ajkbiotech,"One of my favorite films, ever",10,13 May 2021,"One of my favorite films, ever.Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf, who has to be considered one of the greatest if not the greatest writer of the 20th century, is off the hook great. Justly, she won the Academy Award for this performance. It is remarkable, mesmerizing and enrapturing.This is what method acting is.Not to be outdone, Julianne Moore & Meryl Streep also have major parts in this complex film with multiple intertwined plots based on the Michael Cunningham novel, in turn based loosely upon the Woolf novel Mrs. Dalloway, a brilliant work if ever there was one.This film also has Ed Harris in a major role.Just a perfect film.One that merits rewatching.",The Hours
95,ldavis-2,This is an important movie -- NOT!,2,26 June 2003,"Boring and pretentious! The dialog drove me nuts! Nobody in real life talks the way these characters do. I found myself waiting for something - anything - to happen. Philip Glass's shameless rip-off of ""Moonlight Sonata"" didn't help.Sorry, I don't understand why Kidman won the Oscar. After thinking that her, Streep's, Moore's and Harris's line delivery wildly fluctuated on purpose so to clue us in at something deeper, I realized it was merely sloppy direction. Perhaps Daldry was too intimidated by them to steer them where he wanted them to go. I found this especially true of Streep. She kisses Janney not the way one kisses her lover, but as if she just wanted to get it over with! However, Daldry coaxed a great performance out of little Jack Rovello. Too bad he couldn't form a bridge from Richie to Richard. People change as they grow, but it never seemed as if they were the same character.Daldry makes two fatal mistakes: opening with Virginia's suicide and having an elderly Laura visit Clarissa. I would've ended with Virginia's suicide, then Laura doing what she describes to Clarissa: get up, make breakfast, then hop on a bus, leaving a note on the table. It's not important to know anything more. Indeed, it would've been more powerful if we didn't learn of her fate.I wondered where Laura got the money for a posh hotel, and how Clarissa and Sally can afford a high six-figure Manhattan flat compared with Richard's more-realistic cubbyhole. Not that it has anything to do with anything, but when a movie doesn't jell, your mind wanders.",The Hours
96,Michael Fargo,Adding up the hours,8,1 January 2003,"I wasn't familiar with the source material for ""The Hours,"" so all that happens was fresh and impressive. From the onset, I fought the unrelenting ""seriousness"" of the themes here. I could be accused of seeking out depressing movies, but this one became a challenge. I surrendered only because of the quality of the filmmaking. And it's the filmmaking that was consistently innovative and well-crafted. The ""cleverness"" of linking these stories is arch and literary. But Philip Glass' surprisingly lyrical work on the soundtrack kept everything flowing like the water imagery that is so important to the story. The music he provides marks the time much like some cosmic clock. I wasn't prepared for the ""surprise"" at the end of the film. However, I was very impressed that the director/screenwriter let the ""big moment"" happen off screen, and we only see the actions Meryl Streep takes after the burning realization of what has motivated Julianne Moore's character. I have great respect for how that was handled cinematically, and the emotional impact of it made a greater impact than what could have been didactic and preachy. Homophobia as presented by Hollywood (""8 Mile"" for instance) can be glib and held at a distance. ""The Hours"" takes us deep into a world where every daily act--as simple as baking a cake--is tinged with the pain of conflict over repressed sexuality. The performances are worthy of all the press they have garnered. However, Ed Harris is still ""acting large"" from his turn in ""Pollock."" Rage isn't always loud. And his one note scream kept the scenes between he and Streep from being as powerful as they might have been. An unexpected payoff might be that if they had been as searing as the material hinted, we might have been too devastated to continue watching. The dialog in the Streep/Harris scenes felt stilted and rehearsed. Julianne Moore has the misfortune of playing the same role in another film of importance this year, ""Far From Heaven."" Personally, I liked her better here, because there's less of it. Her pain, particularly in the presence of a child, borders on the obscene. While it's all necessary for the plot and point of the film, I was reserved in appreciation for her work.I've always been a fan of Nicole Kidman. I can't think of a single film where she's been a disappointment. Other than a few misfires with her accent, she's fascinating to watch and her madness is what I've experienced as true madness. She sets a new standard for playing ""psychotic"" on the screen. She's frightened, frightening and haunted. While the rationale her character presents for her actions is ennobled here--something I personally reject--again the plot requires it. Woolf's suicide note (which opens the film) is presented without challenge either clinically or morally. I think her actions deserve more examination than the film provides. Nevertheless, the impact of her act on her art and legacy is well documented--and used--here.Again, Meryl Streep trumps everyone. She does work here comparable to what she accomplished in ""Sophie's Choice."" Her agony, while voiced, is purely an internal performance. Her final revelation sent shivers through me.
But again, I feel the true accomplishment is taking material that is full of weight and despair and keeping it moving toward an end that is full of surprise and catharsis. I never knew what was coming next. It's a rare accomplishment for a filmmaker, and Stephen Daldry deserves highest praise for using David Hare's thrilling screenplay and Philip Glass'score and the performances to perfection.",The Hours
97,Ric-7,Eleven if not Twelve,10,23 January 2011,"I saw this film in the cinema when it was first released eight years ago, and gave it a 10. I have not read the book, so I can't make any comparison. I thought the film was very moving and very somber when I first saw it: it is not a film to be enjoyed at a party, and it is definitely not a film for children, as they would not get it.The film deals with depression, schizophrenia, suicide, and several related themes. This is not a spoiler because the film begins with the documented, historical fact of Virginia Woolf's suicide. My theory as to why the film became such a sensation on its release was that the script had so many opportunities for so many extremely talented actors (including female actors) to have a big scene or two, which did not require overacting or absurd characterizations.The acting was so subtle and so terrific, after seeing it only once years ago, when I rented the DVD today I had totally forgotten that Meryl Streep was in the film. In fact, she's a leading role in the film. How could I have forgotten about her being in it? Because she did not overact, or chew the scenery, or carry on and draw attention to her performance. But what I saw this evening was devastating. She has two scenes which are indescribable: when she's by the dishwasher, and later in the film, just listening to a late-night visitor. When someone does a collection of Streep's best scenes, there will be at least two or three from this film.Every one of the ""name"" stars has a nice scene, and the revelation to me was Stephen Dillane, who plays Virginia's husband. At the railway station. OMG.Look at the scene with Jeff Daniels (who plays ""gay"" perfectly and not stereotypically) and Meryl Streep. She collapses in total angst and sorrow, and he won't approach her and give her a hug. We think that's a false moment--why won't he do that? Anyone would. But after a long time, he finally approaches and she waves him off and says she does not want to be touched. He probably knew that. That scene is absolutely remarkable.If you are over 50 or have some idea of Virginia Woolf, and would not be upset at viewing a foreign film with subtitles, try this one. It does not have subtitles, but if you need dubbed dialogue, the ideas in this film cannot be dubbed.I gave it a 10/10 when it came out. If there was an eleven, I'd give that now.",The Hours
98,ArizWldcat,"Get over yourselves, already!",2,20 August 2005,"I have to say that I can't fault the acting, or the musical score, and the screenplay was well adapted for the screen. But this movie was not entertaining; it was extremely morbidly depressing. As others have said, Julianne Moore's character was depressed for what seemed like no good reason (well, maybe pregnancy ...it could make anyone nuts...but that only lasts 9 months and then you just get over it already). Ed Harris's last line mentioned that he and Meryl's character had the happiest of times...oh, really? Gee, if THAT was happy, I'd really really hate to see sad. This movie was thought provoking, but I certainly can't recommend it on that basis. I just attended several movies at the Sundance film festival last month. I enjoyed every one of those more than I did this one. Sadly enough, some of those films will never get the recognition or screen time they deserve. My advice is to go and see Nicholas Nickleby...oh, wait...I haven't seen it. It's not at my local cineplex while THIS is. (sigh)....",The Hours
99,ilovedolby,`The Hours' is an astonishing cinematic achievement!,10,4 March 2003,"I admit I wasn't anticipating seeing `The Hours.' From what I saw in trailers and on television it looked promising, but not something I was interested in. However, since it recently won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture (Drama), I thought it only prudent that I check out this critically acclaimed motion picture. 	My immediate reaction-astounding! The film had some of 2002's best performances, not to mention the excellent screenplay, dialogue, original score, and direction. I'm ashamed to say that I categorized this film as a `chick flick' before seeing it; the stereotypical label of `chick flick' should only be used in relation to the ever-so-common romantic comedy. Starring Meryl Streep, the beautiful Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman who portrays the twentieth century author, Virigina Woolf, `The Hours' is an astonishing cinematic achievement. 	The story concerns the lives of three women through three different eras who struggle with depression and suicide as the film jumps from one time period to another, showing the relationship between events taking place in their lives. The first time frame is that of the early twentieth century, focusing on Virginia Woolf (Kidman) and her time spent writing her novel, `Mrs. Dalloway.' Woolf suffered from fits of depression and attempted suicide on more than one occasion. The second time frame was that of the 1950s and focuses on the character, Laura Brown (Moore), who is a housewife suffering from loneliness and leading ultimately to deep depression. The third aspect of the story takes place in New York City in 2001, following the story of Clarissa Vaughn (Streep), and her day spent setting up a party for her friend, Richard (Ed Harris), an author suffering from AIDS. All of these women have one connection, they have all been profoundly affected by the novel, `Mrs. Dalloway;' Woolf the creator, Brown the reader, and Vaughn living out the story. 	 Streep (`Sophie's Choice,' `The Bridges Of Madison County,' and `Out Of Africa'), as always, gives a top-notch performance. Her character struggles throughout this one-day in time when she tries to throw a party for her long time friend. However, as Richard is dying, he points out to her that the only reason he is still alive is because he lives to give Clarissa purpose in her life. She isn't very happy with her personal life and has chosen to devote her enthusiasm towards him. Richard's words strike a chord inside her as she can't help but feel that he is right, somehow, and that a turning point has come along. She must now focus on improving her personal life. Streep is extremely moving in her role and was nominated for Best Actress at the Golden Globes, however, her costar, Nicole Kidman took the award home. Streep is also being nominated for an Oscar for her work in `Adaptation.'	Julianne Moore (`The Shipping News,' `Hannibal,' and `Boogie Nights') is by far one of the best actresses out there. This year, she has given two stellar performances; here and in `Far From Heaven.' Her character in `The Hours' is very tragic. To watch her suffer is heart wrenching as she exudes such a presence. I'm hopeful that she wins her nomination for Best Supporting Actress. 	When it comes to Nicole Kidman (`Eyes Wide Shut,' `Moulin Rouge,' and `The Others'), one can expect a first-rate performance. She is barely recognizable beneath the elaborate makeup as Woolf, but Kidman is marvelous. Her performance won her Best Actress awards at The Golden Globes and at the BAFTA's. And of course, she is being nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards-she is a shoe-in. 	Expect outstanding performances from Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Stephan Dillaine, Jeff Daniels, and Claire Danes despite their small roles in the grand scheme of things. 	 	Stephen Daldry (`Billy Elliot') directed `The Hours.' He has done a fine job putting this film together and is being nominated for an Oscar. Phillip Glass's poignant score for the film is also being nominated.	This film is a must-see despite its disturbing subject matter. It's not a tearjerker; however, I wouldn't recommend seeing it if you are in blue mood. The bottom line is that it's a great film and certainly deserves more distribution than its current run has allotted. ****",The Hours
100,moutonbear25,Why is everything wrong?,10,19 February 2003,"** some small spoilers ** People face the hours between wake and sleep every day and if they're lucky enough, they'll do it again several times before they die.  If all this sounds dramatic, it's because it is.  It is the inexplicable nature of our existence that Stephen Daldry's `The Hours' explores so delicately and portrays so movingly.  Daldry's canvas comprises of three different women on three different days in three different eras and they are all tied together by a literary classic, Virginia Woolf's `Mrs. Dalloway'. Seamlessly, their lives flow in and out of each others, breaking the barriers of space and time thanks to Peter Boyle's editing, which is both astute and precise.  The opening sequence jumps back and forth between each era as each of our heroines wakes up to the new day.  They wash their faces, think of what they're going to do with their days and make breakfast arrangements.  Some rituals are timeless.  To demonstrate this, Boyle cuts from flowers being arranged, accentuating a prim and proper entrance way in 1923 England to flowers being snuck in as an early morning surprise from a husband to his wife in 1951 Los Angeles to another of our heroines declaring that she will be buying the flowers herself in 2001 New York City.  All the while, shots further fused together by a piano and string driven score by Philip Glass that has to be, by definition, transcendent to get its point across.  Visual and audio merge perfectly to create a new media symphony. And of course there is one other key thing that ties each era together - the fallen angels that are our heroines.  Each is mature.  Each is beautiful.  Each is unhappy.  And thus begins the journey for each of these women to reclaim the lives that are their own and find meaning in those existences in hopes of one day achieving fulfillment and overcoming the looming depression that holds their lives as prisoner. Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) lies back on her bed, joined by her daughter (Claire Danes) and discussing life.  The ticking of a nearby clock can be heard, slowly moving the scene forward, second by second.  In that moment, life and the passing of time are inseparable.  That ticking clock taunts Clarissa by showing her the importance of time and how necessary it is to seize it while letting it slip past her just the same.  Vaughn has been living a great deal of her life on hold, longing to get back to a time when she was once happy instead of trying to find a new happiness in each day. Streep is restrained yet highly emotional as Vaughn in order to properly convey how close to the edge she truly is.  She has been holding on to so much hurt that David Hare's subtle script eludes to just enough to allow the viewer to draw their own conclusions without relying on some catastrophic event from Vaughn's past to explain her current sadness.From the outside, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is the image of perfection. She has a beautiful suburban home with a responsible husband, beautiful four year old boy and another child expected within the course of the next five months or so.  She is living the American dream of 1951.  Like a dutiful wife, she proceeds to bake her husband a birthday cake after he leaves for work.  The cake caves and consequently so does her mood.  Moore is composed as Brown despite the fact that she looks as though she may cry at any moment.  She doesn't want her son to see how difficult even the most menial of tasks are on her brittle soul.  She doesn't want her son to see how close she is to giving up entirely.  This dream, this American dream, was not a dream of her own design.  She played along though, not knowing what else to do. `Mrs. Dalloway decided she would buy the flowers herself.'  It is the first sentence of a novel that would further solidify Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) as a standout in the literary world.  It is also a novel that would go on to change the lives of the characters in this film after being recontextualized into this fictitious existence.  She transcribes the words with urgency and excitement.  This inspiration is sudden and clearly it is not certain how long the flow will last.  Along with the inspiration, Woolf is not even certain how much longer she will last.  She grapples every day with her own sanity without actually knowing how to maintain it.  Early on in the film, she comes face to face with mortality as she looks a dead bird in the face.  Her eyes are transfixed as she lies still by the bird on the ground.  In this moment, Woolf is reminded of how unexpected each day can be.  Nicole Kidman is unrecognizable as this troubled genius that was far ahead of her own time.  However hidden underneath prosthetics, Kidman's talent that has been growing more and more compelling and captivating in the last years shines right through. So what of `Mrs. Dalloway'?  Virginia Woolf is tortured writing the all too familiar content of the novel; Laura Brown is tortured as she identifies with the heroine's plight of hopelessness; and Clarissa Vaugn is tortured living in the shadow of a character's existence she feels might one day repeat itself.  It is a stream of consciousness novel that recounts the story of a British socialite who is throwing a party to mask the fact that she is slowly falling apart.  Oddly enough, it too all takes place in one day.  And by the end, someone dies.  Woolf's husband Leonard asks his wife why a character must die.  To which she replies that someone must die so that the remaining character's can appreciate life.  For anyone who can identify with this film, let's hope it doesn't come to that.",The Hours

It has moments where it gets pretty dull. But for the most part, its worth watching. The acting is very good. Nicole Kidman is as great as you've heard though she wouldnt be my choice to win the oscar. Meryl Streep is very good but overrated, her performance in Adaptation was easily better. Julianne Moore is good but very overrated, though the reason shes not as good as Streep or Kidman is not entirely her fault. Ed Harris was so-so, didnt deserve his  nomination. Stephen Dillane gave the better supporting performance. The problem with this movie is that the script is alot weaker in Julianne's scenes, the dialogue is weaker. The movie moves kind of slow which makes it dull at times. But the Kidman and Streep's performances and the very nice score make this worth watching. 8 out of 10.",The Hours
102,jay4stein79-1,Utter Tripe,5,31 October 2004,"Michael Cunningham is a gifted writer. His A Home At The End Of The World is a brilliant and moving novel (as well as an excellent film) that should be read by everyone. I feel so very bad for him that the first filmed adaptation of one of his novels was this.I first became aware of this movie while sitting down to dinner as an undergraduate. There I sat with a couple friends when a few more acquaintances showed up, eyes downcast, hair un-kempt, depressed. This was particularly odd for two reasons: first, these three tended to be all happy happy smiles and laughter; second, there were three and they were all glum. ""What's going on?"" the rest of us asked. ""Nothing,"" they replied, ""We just watched the Hours at the Up-Town. It was a little heavy."" (Nevermind that I wanted to scream, WHAT IS THIS?!?! 1968?!?! Heavy?!!? What the heck?!?!). I simply said, ""Heavy?"" One said ""Yeah, it was just so...heavy...[siiiiiigggggghhhhhh]."" ""But was it, you know, good?"" ""Yeah, but it was just so, you know..."" ""Heavy?"" I asked. ""Yeah,"" one replied, ""Heavy."" Needless to say, this recommendation did not light a fire beneath me, so I waited until the Hours came out on video the following summer and rented it prepared for the un-paralleled heaviness I was about to experience.Oh, how I wish the movie were simply ""heavy"" and not bad in addition. If someone tells you different, tells you that this film is brilliant, they are, in fact, lying through their teeth. No person in their right mind could find this a worthwhile way to spend an evening - and not because watching the Hours will lead to a major ""downer."" Yes, the Hours is ""depressing,"" but what did you expect with a movie about depression? I knew the movie would be sad and, as it were, ""heavy,"" and I was prepared for it. I in fact love, absolutely adore, sad movies, gloomy movies, mis-anthropic, depressing, and ""heavy"" movies.My dislike stems not from that. I disliked it because it was bad , plain and simple. The performances are all very solid (particularly Ed Harris, Julianne Moore, and John C. Reilly) and the concept is somewhat interesting, but after watching it I felt horn-swaggled.I began to question the purpose of the movie. What, really, was the point of re-iterating the fact that women still have the short end of the stick? I have seen that in a number of films, many more perceptive to the constant subjection of women than the Hours was. And why use Mrs. Dalloway like this? The use of Mrs. Dalloway as a connection between the three stories lends nothing to the narrative overall. Everyone seemed to miss that point.I guess, maybe, I just didn't ""get it,"" but from where I sit today, I'm still not sure there was something to even get. I still think that the movie has all the trappings of an important, great film, but inside it's empty as an summer blockbuster. Now, that's an exaggeration, to be sure, but I don't think that the Hours has the depth that the populace has been led to believe it does. It's simply the earnest but failed attempt to imitate a masterpiece.",The Hours

Having read the novel, I can say that the adaptation was amazing, but there's nothing wrong if you haven't read the novel. Being a man, a young one but a man, I can't understand women but I'm still fascinated by them. THE HOURS is a feminine film (not a feminist one; there's a difference), but I could feel what these women felt, and that's the magic of cinema. From Stephen Daldry's impeccable direction to the terrific performances, without dissonant notes, THE HOURS is a film to be remembered for years.10/10",The Hours

Reading it is only mildly enjoyable. When you're done, you appreciate and admire the narrative, but you don't want to read it again.  You're glad you did, but once was enough.Unsurprisingly, this film is strongly interlaced with a novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  The three separate stories told are weaved well together; each gets roughly a third of the screen time, and each also feels equally weighted.  All of the women in the film are excellent. Meryl Streep is still a joy to watch, even in an slightly unusual role for her.  Kidman is quite good as she continues to display her range.  Julianne Moore is solid, but I'm tiring a bit of her in the depressed housewife type of part.  Ed Harris has been criticized as over-the-top, but I think that's because most of his roles are more subtle and muted.  He seemed effectively eccentric to me. John C. Reilly was Mr. Cellophane, reliable as always.The only problem I had with the story was the lack of explanation for Moore's issues.  Explanation was attempted, but I never fully understood her motivations.  Also, emotional distance is a theme throughout the film, and strangely enough that's also one of the reasons it dodges 'great' status. It's a difficult film to connect with, perhaps more so for myself being male. Bottom Line: Well done, but not particularly well liked.",The Hours

It's a film about strong woman, every one of whom has to deal with it one way or another. What I like about it is, that ""The Hours"" doesn't have a message towards the end like ""suicide is wrong, don't kill yourself"", which it easily could have had with a worse screenplay. It raises understanding for people who take this choice. But it still has optimism in it. Nearly everyone has to struggle from time to time, you just try and do the best you can. It's a very sensitive movie with an interesting structure and excellent performances. Nicole Kidman is great as Virginia Woolf, the ever-great Julianne Moore too, while the best acting in this film comes once again from Meryl Streep.

How can the life of a woman influence so much the course of action of the lives of other women across time time distances? Just because they have common links between them? No. It's because the three of them are so different, that ultimately their lives come to a crossing. Based on the Best-Selling, Pulitzer Prize winner book ""The Hours"", David Hare (screenwriter) and Stephen Daldry (director) adapted a piece on which the possibilities of failure were enormous; to merge three paralel stories of three different women, on three different times, the difficulty was quite high. However it was very sucessefuly surpassed. The Hours is a movie where you have to plunge into this world to understand, feel and like it. Also, it is implied that Michael Cunnigham's book was highly cinematic, the details, the beauty, the dialogues and even the inherent fact that troughout the movie we all realize how trivial and ordinary these women's lives are. But they are anything but that: they are connected not only by the words of the own Virginia Woolf, but also because of the women's fear of being afraid, and left alone. Virginia Woolf is a delusional woman, inside her head a storm of thinkings is going on: three suicide attempts, the brainstorming of the end of her book, Mrs. Dalloway, and the envy she feels for her sister who made all the right choices and has all she ever wanted. The mesmerizing interest that Laura Brown, 20 years later feels for this woman is compelling. This woman is also confusing, and, at parts the most unintersting story of the three. But it isn't. the end of the story proves that Laura Brown was the deepest, most confusing, and , why not say it, the most interesting of them all, when she comes across the life of the 2001 New Yorker Clarissa Vaughn. Clarissa, a women in her perfect sanity is the one with the most challenging life. Her homosexuality, her former male lover dying of AIDS and the life of her daughter born of Artificial Insemination. For as much as we try, the premise of this movie leads us to an endless discussion, which also makes so very hard to me not to get into details that could ultimately reveal the secret of the movie, which is why, The Hours is such an obligatory movie to see. Not only for its performances, cinematography, screenplay, everything. And it is also imperative to see, in the end, an old Julianne Moore, really putting Meryl Streep's fantastic performance to shame.10 out of 10.",The Hours

There's even a special feature on the DVD about the music, but not a word about a portion of it being taken from the Errol Morris documentary.

There are countless flaws in the film. First and most, acting could be a lot better. Knowing Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep can act, I have to say the fault is the director's. In addition to predictable dialogues, cheap and tacky symbolism is out there, such as Streep playing with eggs to imply sex, while there is no sex to imply. Some makeups look unrealistic and ugly, especially the one on Ed Harris dying for AIDS and the other on Moore in her 70s. Editing is unbelievably choppy as a big production in the 21st Century. Philip Glass, whose filmscoring is monotonous and dull, shouldn't waste his talent on film.",The Hours
111,GMJames,A challenging movie that kept my interest,7,28 June 2003,"While watching ""The Hours"" I couldn't help but be reminded of the movie ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"". Not by their storylines, but their format of setting the movie in different eras. If it's not created properly, it would look more like a desperate gimmick and can confuse and try the patience of the viewer.""The Hours"" did have some pacing problems. It slowed down with some unnecessary story exposition. Perhaps some more edits would've been needed.
Having said that, I was impressed with ""The Hours"" for the lead performances. When Nicole Kidman is given a role she can sink her teeth into and not play a male character's girlfriend or wife (e.g.: Days of Thunder, My Life, Billy Bathgate, Batman Forever, etc.), she can be outstanding. (Check out Kidman's performance in the dark comedy ""To Die For"".) Her performance as the tormented but brilliant writer Virginia Woolf, was very deserving of the Oscar she received in a very close race. Her anger toward her husband who simply couldn't understand what was going on with her was very vivid and very convincing. Kidman made me believe she was Woolf writing ""Mrs Dalloway"" in 1929.Julianne Moore plays a 1950s pregnant California housewife who happens to read the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". She has a loving husband and a young son. She also is in the process of going through depression and is wondering if she's going crazy. While watching Moore's performance, I found it to be an interesting comparison with her role in ""Far From Heaven"". Not only in settings but also in how a woman's role is presented in the 50s. Understanding wife, beautiful house, obedient children. Everything should be great in that woman's life, but there's something wrong.
Meryl Streep plays a present-day book editor. She lives with her lover, she has a college-age daughter. She's also helping her friend, a poet who is dying of the HIV virus (Ed Harris). She's setting up a party her dying friend to celebrate an award he's receiving. However she has never given herself the time to take care of herself and her life. I've always loved Streep's work. It's not what she says on the script, it's the little character traits that tell me the most about the characters she plays. I think of the scene where she's making dinner for the party and one of her friend's exs (Jeff Daniels) comes to her place a few hours early. She breaks down in the kitchen. Daniels' character wonders out loud if she wants him to help her or if she wants him to leave. The point to me is just to be there and not solve her issues she's going through. I've had some fun reading in a number of articles about how women love the film and men don't understand it. For myself, I liked the line spoken by Virginia Woolf which summed up the movie for me, ""...you cannot find peace by avoiding life.""",The Hours

It is very slow for the first 2/3rds to 3/4s of the film.Plenty of good material, well filmed, well directed, worth seeing.

Suicide, unhappiness and repressed lesbianism are major themes although somewhat subtly explored.  In their search for significance, none of them ever comes close to the answer.What made it enjoyable for me was the lovely period detail for the Virginia Wolf and Laura Brown segments.  Nicole Kidman and Miranda Richardson stole the show, along with the kid who played Laura Brown's son.  The rest of the cast was very good, but they weren't as fascinating as the three aforementioned actors who raised the level of this morbid material to something so much more than just depressing that it became engrossing and entertaining.For some reason the Laura Brown character just didn't resonate as well as Nicole Kidman's character.  Meryl Streep delivered some special moments, but her character had a rather odd reaction after her friend's suicide.  It was simply incongruous for her character after she had wallowed in misery to suddenly brighten up at the end of the film and become optimistic when the man she had loved was dead.  The motivation for this change was either goofy inexplicable optimism or a morbid existential love the one your with kind of thing.  Yuk!  God is the source of strength and hope, and these fatalistically interesting characters searched and searched for answers they were not going to find in themselves or their dreary thought processes.
However, it was a brilliant touch by the director or whomever to connect the lives of the three women at the end when Laura Brown turns out to be the mother of the boy who grew up to be the man Meryl Streep loved.  And all of that intricacy goes along with Laura Brown reading the Mrs. Dalloway book by Virgina Wolfe while Meryl Streep's character is nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by her son,  and all the while the three of them are grappling with unhappiness and an attempt to make some sense of their own existence and significance.

Nevertheless it is an excellent movie, with a fine script given excellent direction. The performances have to be seen to be believed. Streep is her usual reliable self. Kidman is excellent in an under-stated way. But it is Moore that blows the viewer away. The script doesn't give her enough to do, but her acting more than makes up for it, her facial expressions are fantastic at conveying the silent desperation she is sinking in. Ed Harris also lends fine support, and Jeff Daniels (haven't seen him in a while) makes a lovely cameo.Literate and lovely, this is a splendid piece of film-making. On the down side, it's ridiculous seeing the older women version of Moore with the exact same hair-style. But that's only a small gripe.

Crashingly expensive BORE and the Kidman role could have been pulled off by any halfway decent high-school actress. Not that Nicole was bad, just that the role is zilch –anybody can play a zombie with a false nose. But the other parts of the film. (it's a three part invention) were even worse.

This press release merely confirms the fact that so-called ""critical acclaim"" has little or nothing to do with actual quality and everything to do with industry promotion, also known as gold plated ""hype"".

It is magnificent from where you see it, in addition to the technical staff in all areas filled by excellent artists, it is a film that is enjoyable to watch and not just technical excellence.The way that the 3 main characters are in different contexts but are still linked and related to each other through strong emotions is simply fantastic. Personally, I do not like films that play a lot with the resource of the timeline, but in addition to using this resource wonderfully, it is necessary to understand the symbolic network generated by these three protagonists.Applause to that script and direction which took a way of approaching the film that anyone else could have gone crazy and ended up making an existential film with little coherence.The way the color palettes are handled, differentiating the contexts and emotional charges of the same, work totally, at the same time these are related to the wonderful costumes of Ann Roth and the emotional music of the great Philip Glass.The cast is amazing and they fulfill any expectations one may have, starting with Nicole Kidman with an UNRECOGNIZABLE appearance and accent, which simply disappears and embodies the dark and misunderstood Virginia Woolf, a well deserved Oscar for 'Best Actress' beyond a few minutes that it was, it was simply iconic. I continue with Julianne Moore with a meticulous performance but that every time grows and tears in this reader who reflects on her life through Woolf's novel. Meryl with a seemingly simple character but who takes it and shows it with a weakness and past that touches the feelings. A perfect trio of protagonists. Going to the general cast: Ed Harris gives one of his best performances for me, full of pain, anguish, depth and with a vitality that decreases every time. Toni Collette in her 5 minutes, leaves her mark on this film, full of frustration and pain as well, she shows that she is an actress of all genres.It is a sad film that carries a lot of pain and a rather subjective symbolism that in my opinion is a bit existentialist, it leaves me with a feeling of emptiness, little desire and at the same time gratitude to see these strong emotions projected without an overstated drama, Hats off for Stephen Daldry.",The Hours

The measure of a movie star is whether we're willing to watch them doing nothing, and as the ill-fated Mrs. Woolf, Nicole does hours upon Hours of nothing, and it's absolutely riveting. She has just enough talent to be believable and just enough charisma to be watchable, and she earned that Oscar.And the odd thing is, she's a sideshow. People who complain that this movie is boring and depressing would probably find the novels and short stories of Virginia Woolf boring and depressing, largely because two of her major themes are . . . you guessed it . . . boredom and depression. Or at least emptiness. Which is exactly what the film's two genuine heroines, Laura the disgruntled 50's housewife and Clarissa the lesbian book editor, are facing in their lives. Laura, played by Julianne Moore, is married to a man who adores her but whom she doesn't love (John C Reilly, in one of his standard thankless roles). Clarissa, played by Meryl Streep, has centered her life on a gay poet stricken with AIDS dementia (Ed Harris, who may be a little too vibrant for a dying swan but is otherwise quite impressive). Nice little inversion on the Obscure Object of Desire, no? Julianne Moore sleepwalks through her performance, which is appropriate to the character but demands patience from the viewer (a patience which is ultimately rewarded). And, as is so often the case, you can see Meryl Streep acting. But she does it so damn well you're willing to forgive her. In a late scene, when she's required to listen, she communicates more pain and longing in a reaction shot than most actresses could do with a Shakespeare monologue. And there is a host of excellent supporting performances: Toni Collette and Jeff Daniels both shine in extended cameos, Stephen Dillane is quite moving as Virginia's dense but well-meaning (and, it must be said, frequently cuckolded) husband Leonard, and even Claire Danes, as Clarissa's daughter Julia, manages to look like she belongs on screen with these dramatic heavyweights.But don't let the acting distract you completely from the film-making. If you rent or buy ""The Hours,"" watch it a few times to figure out what makes this movie so disturbing: the bizarre camera angles (what's with all those eggs)? The over-amplified background noise (why exactly do we need crickets chirping when Laura Brown is having birthday cake with her husband)? The score by that rhapsodist of repetition, Phillip Glass (why is he so much less annoying when his monochromatic scale-playing is accompanied by images)? Or maybe all the elements combine to create an atmosphere of disorientation and discomfort that can be a little difficult to endure. Still, it succeeds on both an emotional and meta level (you really should read ""Mrs. Dalloway"" to get all the references) so I call it brilliant. Go watch it, right now.",The Hours
126,evilmatt-3,A fantastic film entirely about inner worlds,9,4 January 2003,"It is the mark of a terrific film that, for all the banality of what we see on screen, the emotions of its characters can take hold of the audience and tell a nevertheless fascinating story.  _The Hours_, being character driven, was heavily dependent on and well-served by its cast.  The three lead actresses, especially Kidman, tell the story in a profound and meaningful way, without being preachy or condescending.  Very nice indeed.I'm admittedly not a follower of Virginia Woolf's work, but this movie definitely piqued my curiosity.  The themes presented in this film are certainly not new to American cinema, but they're rarely explored with such honesty.  Of particular interest was the de-sexualization of the story and its characters.  It would have been very easy for the film to become yet another post-feminist-why-me-haven't-I-seen-this-somehwere-before piece of propaganda.  Instead, it wisely chooses to present the sexuality of its characters as fluid, suggesting that the fact that the three main characters are women is perhaps more superficial than either women OR men (of any sexuality) would care to believe.  This adds significant discomfort to the film that I found absolutely wonderful and original, and the cast pulled it off with barely a hitch.Oh, and don't EVER compare this film to the infantile and morally snobbish _Far From Heaven_.  That's just obscene.",The Hours

But whoever created Kidman's nose did a horrendously bad job. I can't understand how they could have looked at dailies and let things stand. From scene to scene it appears a different color, sometimes even a different shape. More than once it doesn't match the color of her facial skin tone.Maybe someday, with the technology available today, they could digitally fix this visual gaffe which is so distracting.The movie is one of the greats. I hope someday they repair this unfortunate flaw.",The Hours
129,Peegee-3,Brilliant! So the inner life can be made visual!!,10,31 December 2002,"Despite the fact that this film (based on Michael Cunningham's splendid novel) deals chiefly with the lives of three women,it's breadth and depth make it universal and appealing to both genders.David Hare has done a brilliant job of translating an introspective novel into a cinematic experience of visual and emotional beauty.  The performances: Nicole Kidman comes through as the greatest surprise, to me.  Her pacing, her facial expressions, her whole presentation of a woman caught in the horror between creativity and madness is very affecting and memorable. Alas, her physical appearance was made to look too obvious (i.e. ""This is a mad woman""), too lacking in the  elegance of the real Virginia Woolf...and I found that distracting.  Julianne Moore gave her careful and believable interpretation of a very delicate, disturbed woman...She's a totally reliable actress.  And of course, the consummate performer, Meryl Streep, came through again, nuanced and intelligent, portraying a complex woman of deep feeling, not afraid to love fully and humanely...another woman, a gay man dyng of AIDS and her daughter, born from an unknown father.  While some have criticized Ed Harris (as the dying gay man) as performing over the top, I found his portrayal belieable and very moving.  Kudos also go to John C.Reilly, Stephan Dillane(as Leonard Woolf) and the small boy whose name, alas, I don't remember, who plays a very young, sensitive son with the skill of a veteran...To the editor, Peter Boyle, and the director Stephen Daldry my highest praise and thanks for a film that travels its winding ways, hither and thither, from life to life, with the rhythm and smoothness of a glorious adagio, dealing with some of life's most troubling aspects in a way that has made the whole experience indelible.",The Hours
130,gerry-russell-139,best picture of '02,10,24 January 2003,"Michael Cunningham's brilliantly insightful novel makes a flawless transfer to the screen. Nicole Kidman (possibly in the role of her career) is Ms. Virginia Woolf (prosthetic nose and all) writing her immortal MRS. DALLOWAY which Julianne Moore's Laura Brown is thoroughly absorbed in, circa 1951; the incomparable Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn, a lesbian living in the present day (2001) with her live-in lover Sally (Allison Janney) in New York while taking care of her AIDS-ridden best friend Richard (Ed Harris). The plot revolves around one day in each of their lives in which the crux of their entire life unfolds forever altering their entire outlook on their personal lives.Meryl's homosexuality is very subtle to the point where you think her lover is her best friend... until the end of the film when Meryl give her this huge, wet kiss. Julianne's Laura Brown, on the outside, is the epitome of the ideal '50s wife/mother but on the inside she's like an Oprah trying to find inner peace with herself, unfortunately with extremely devastating results.While Meryl does have the most on-screen time Kidman steals the show... the viewer becomes more engrossed in her half of the story while Moore's half is thoroughly depressed and Streep's is teetering on the brink of a nervous breakdown, but still holding a tight grasp on the audiences attention span.
The story makes sense in every aspect where you don't feel like the screenwriter is mentally trying to confuse you with the jumping back and forth between eras. The script, score, Streep, Kidman, direction and the film itself will definitely be nominated for Oscars next month.",The Hours

And it's sure to be loved by all suicidal lesbians. I on the other hand was bored to tears.It starts out with Virginia Woolf (Nicole with fake nose). committing suicide (1920s)and the Philip Glass soundtrack leads one to anticipate an interesting film. We cut to 2001 and Meryl Streep and her cell phone go out to throw a party for Rich (Ed Harris) a poet and friend. We cut to 1951 and Julianne Moore basically reprises her role in Safe, this time influenced by the Woolf novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" while stuck as a McCarthy era housewife.The thread running through the film is the suicidal lesbian aspect of the novel, the synchronicity between the women of the 3 eras, and the fact that Moore reads Woolf, and Moore is the mother of Rich, Streep's poet friend.We spend the rest of the film cutting back and forth between the 3 realities, the discontent, and it quickly gets boring as nothing really happens in the film. It's got a pretentious artsiness to it and if you're a lesbo you'll love it, I'm sure.",The Hours
133,paul-nemecek,A fascinating with brilliant performances,10,1 July 2018,"The movie The Hours is based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel by Michael Cunningham. The book is inspired by Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway, and Virginia Woolf is one of the central characters here. Three separate lives in three different places at three different times are all connected by Mrs. Dalloway. Nicole Kidman plays the novelist Virginia Woolf living in Sussex, England in 1941. Julianne Moore plays Laura Brown, a Los Angeles housewife with a loving husband and a young son. Meryl Streep plays Clarissa Vaughn, a N.Y. publisher in 2001. Woolf wrote Mrs. Dalloway, Laura Brown is reading it, and Clarissa Vaughn references it.Roger Ebert characterizes the connections between the three stories when he describes the film as a ""meditation on separate episodes linked by a certain sensibility"". All three characters feel constrained by social obligation while at the same time experiencing a profound sense of being alone. There are parallels between the characters involving questions of sexual orientation, existential meaning, and ultimately, death. The second and third stories are linked in ways that are not immediately clear, but their connection provides great insights into the deeper meaning of the film. In the end, what really connects their lives is not historical coincidences, but textures and tones.The film is directed by Stephen Daldry who also directed Billy Elliot, a personal favorite of mine. One of the things I like about British films is the emphasis on texture and tone. American films value plot above all else. The complex interweaving of this story and the pacing of the film will be off-putting to filmgoers seeking a steady diet of fast-paced action. It is a tribute to the filmmakers that I left the theater wanting to see the movie again so that I could mine the depths of meaning, and better understand the lives of the characters.If you need additional incentives to motivate you, the film is worth seeing for performances alone. Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep, and Nicole Kidman are some of the great talents working in film. Solid supporting performances are provided by Ed Harris, Claire Danes, and John C. Reilly. Reilly is nominated for best supporting actor for his performance in Chicago, but has the distinction of being in three of the five films nominated for best picture (Chicago, The Hours, and Gangs of New York).Betty Friedan, in writing about the constraining effects of gender roles once wrote that ""beneath our masks we are very much alone."" This loneliness is explored in intimate detail here. A less profound literary reference comes from the 60's pop duo Chad and Jeremy who sang ""I don't care what you say, I won't stay in a world without love."" The Hours is not fast-paced and some will dismiss it as a ""chick flick"", but the film's greatness lies in its probing exploration of the paradoxes of human existence.",The Hours
134,Marie-62,Wow,10,26 June 2003,"This movie has to be one of the most beautiful and sad of it's kind and of it's time. Moore, Kidman, and Streep all should've received some type of award for their work here. Not only do they have a great supporting cast but the storyline is so deep and rich that you can't help but wonder who the brilliant man was who wrote the script and want to shake his hand for doing so. I cried through basically the entire movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat, I can tell you that. What I honestly think though is that (although Nicole Kidman did BEAUTIFULLY) Julianne Moore was a little underrated here. She was FABULOUS. I mean when she turns on the turns she really turns them on. I adore that woman. Great job. And as for Toni Collette as Kitty Barlow, wow. She made quite an impact for 10 minutes of work if I do say so myself. A 10/10 you must see it. I don't think I can own it or probably even watch it again, it was a little too sad to be able to sit through twenty times. But it was fantastic.",The Hours
135,ColeSear,Symphonic,10,24 January 2003,"As I listened to the score of this film which was practically incessant in the first 30 minutes of this film I got goosebumps, Philip Glass truly composed an opus for this film. The Hours grabs you immediately and never lets go. Not that it matters but the trailer for this film is the perfect set up because you should go in prepared to expect a lot of cutting between the stories and that's what you get is absolutely masterful editing.It is almost impossible to review this film having only seen it once, however, I do know that few movies have left me with such a feeling of anticipation and yet the emotional response from me was still natural and I did get taken by surprise a few times as I watched this film. The acting by all those involved is absolutely breathtaking there are no small time roles here and plenty of big time actors I don't think I've seen a more impressive trio than Kidman, Streep and Moore each of their characters is laid out perfectly and while in a sense each is imprisoned by something the reactions are all different and make sense. The supporting cast lead by the chameleon-like Toni Collette is just as impressive every character makes a major impact. It is perhaps the best example of dovetailing and of incorporating back story that I've seen to date. Yet with all this artistic achievement the film is not cold and aloof but it makes you think and it tugs at your heart constantly.This film deserves all it's accolades not only for a brilliant script but also for the amazing direction of Stephen Daldry who has now seriously burst on to the scene with his 2nd consecutive brilliant film. The Hours,n especially Daldry deserves to take home all these awards because Daldry can make films for 50 years to come and not top this it is as grandiose as a 'Citizen Kane.'10.",The Hours

An ingenuous story adaptation, focusing on one day in the lives of three women and one man across different times, who are struck by various degrees of madness leading to suicides, attempted suicides, and, in one instance, a kind of reconciliation with oneself. The use of imagery is wonderful, including the yellow rose to signify death or morbidness, as well as a moving van signifying departure for one of the key characters. And talk about drama, drama, drama. This would also make an incredible stage play, so filled it is with tensions, emotions, and ideas. Kudos to all involved.",The Hours
137,dfwforeignbuff,Streep Kidman Moore star in non mainstream literary Art film RE: Virginia Wolf,10,27 January 2010,"(2002) ""The Hours"" was the original title of ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" Virginia Woolf's 1925 novel that serves as a reference & source of inspiration in this interweaving tale of three women who have intimate connections with the book. Recuperating from a nervous breakdown, Virginia Woolf begins work on her depression-themed novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"", which goes on to play a key role not only in her own life but in the lives of a 1950s housewife contemplating suicide & a new-millennium posh lesbian publisher caring for her dying friend. So it's a interconnecting story of 3 people with literary references to Mrs. Dalloway. As a general rule I don't enjoy movies with 3-4 & more interconnected stories. I did not like Babel very well. I hated Crash (the most overrated movie ever). However I did like this movie. The film has 3 very famous stars & the back ground of the depression of Virginia Woolf. (Meryl Streep Nicole Kidman & Juliane Moore) Kidman went on to win a Best Actress Award 2002 for her role. (Her role is only 1/3 of the film) Kidman, acts with new depth & maturity as she brings this difficult character to life. For Nicole Kidman's role she underwent a physical transformation that renders her nearly unrecognizable. Wearing a prosthetic nose and buried under layers of makeup that hide her beauty, she comes across as sickly, homely, and somewhat demented. However, although Kidman's acting is strong, she overshadows neither Julianne Moore nor Meryl Streep, both of whom give taut, tightly controlled performances. The most notable supporting work is provided by Ed Harris, whose character represents a thread connecting two of the episodes. In a way the film has deep strong interludes about the search for Happiness -or the lack of happiness-- longing for happiness. Mental illness & depression play a role here in all three of the women's character. All Three contemplate Suicide. The film becomes a treatise on our social human connections, our goals & dreams & the elusive dream of happiness & the sometimes seductive call of death. So the material contained in this movie is rather dense & heavy. However it is a good story & the film is executed in a beautiful style & manner. The film might have its strongest appeal for those who are familiar with Mrs. Dalloway. I loved the film on an intellectual level & for me a good emotional connection. Although I don't care for manipulative melodrama this film is not that manipulative but more open ended. The film is a beautifully done adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The Hours is very much a movie, not a filmed book. It is a beautiful artistic film 4 1/2 stars.",The Hours
138,jmc4769,"A for effort, C- for execution",5,25 January 2003,"The Hours is a noble effort. The sets and cinematography are wonderful, but as a whole, this movie is incredibly over-rated. Part of the problem is the switching between three different stories. I was never able to get emotionally involved in any of them, particularly the 1950's story with Julianne Moore. You also need to know that this is a movie about depression and suicide, not just in one of the stories, but in all three! It is definitely not a feel-good movie, and it is definitely not ""life-affirming"" as some have said. I cannot understand why reviewers here and in the media have such high praise for the actresses in this film. Nicole Kidman goes through most of the movie with the same morose expression on her face! And she has so few lines that there is little opportunity for her to give any insight into Virginia Woolf's character. You learn little about the writer's background. She only has one real conversation in the entire movie. Kidman wears a prosthetic nose and speaks in a low husky voice. In fact, her face and voice are virtually unrecognizable. I guess people were so impressed by the different look that they figured it must have been great acting. Julianne Moore also does not get much opportunity to develop her character. Her character, like Kidman's, is so depressed that she has little to say to anyone until the very end of the movie. Like Kidman she goes through the movie with pretty much the same expression on her face, only her expression is more of a ""Stepford Wives"" kind of zombie expression.",The Hours
139,majic-5,A waste of great talent,3,11 November 2007,"As reviewer James Rocchi notes, the chance to feature Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep all in one film must have been almost narcotic for the producers and directors of The Hours. Apparently, they didn't come out of their natural high until after the film was complete. Although the individual performances were all high-caliber, and there is at least a gossamer connection between the three women's stories, the individual stories feel internally disjointed and slight.The gimmick of this film is three interrelated stories of sadness and despair:· Virginia Woolf (Kidman) writing Mrs. Dalloway and struggling with her schizophrenia· A 1950's American, suburban, housewife (Moore), reading Mrs. Dalloway, and yearning to live free as a lesbian· A 2000's lesbian (Streep), living the life of Mrs. Dalloway, preparing an awards party for her bisexual ex-lover  a poet, ravaged by AIDS, who wants to die.Kidman, heavily made up to hide her beauty, is the most convincing of the three. You really get the sense that absent her mental illness, Woolf would have been living larger than life, London's counterpart to New York's Dorothy Parker. Her frustration with her illness, and with the cloistering required to subdue it, is tangible and sympathetic. Her decision to live as fully as she can, even if it kills her, comes across as brave, rather than self-indulgent.Moore's anguish as a woman trapped in a marriage she cannot bear with kids she never wanted is somewhat moving. The slice of her life that the movie presents us, however, is too narrow for the audience to build up a reservoir of sympathy. Her character has to be so careful with the emotions she displays outwardly, that even in her private moments, she does little more than sob, so that the audience has to fill in a lot to empathize with the depth of her plight.Streep's character requires even more work on the audience's part. Was her ex-lover also her ex-husband? What's motivated her to keep in close contact with her lover of long ago? What is she feeling about her situation, other than a reflexive attachment to a period of happiness from way back when? Does she feel conflicted between the energy she invests in a past relationship and her current one? Does her lover resent her split commitment? Whatever the audience decides is equally valid and equally unvalidated, since the film gives no clues on these important aspects of her character.The muted climax that ties together Moore's and Streep's lives gives some context to her ex-lover's behavior, but provides none for Streep's, and seems inconsistent with the type of person that Moore's character was earlier in the film. The lack of emotional closure, after two hours of running time, left me scratching my head, feeling gypped, and sad about a waste of great acting talent.",The Hours

Meryl Streep is great and so is Nicole Kidman, who I really think deserved her Oscar. Julianne Moore got nominated for an Oscar, but didn't win.

Lots of the time I think that great movies don't exist after the 21 century, but this film proves me wrong. The scene were Julianne Moore is at her hotel and there is water flooding the room is awesome.

No one writes books like Woolf anymore, and no one should have done a movie based on her book Mrs. Dalloway. She is an interesting historical figure and a good feminist, but that doesn't mean self-indulgent movies should be made about her or her books.In any event, the movie is terribly slow and terribly serious, as are most self-important movies that pretend they are letting the audience in on some philosophical secret that will allow them to live their lives more authentically. BORING! As they say, ""show me, don't tell me.""I'm straining to think of a worse movie, and the only thing coming to mind is ""Dude, Where's my car?"" However, the latter was meant to be dumb. The fact that Kidman got an Oscar for this movie just goes to show you that Oscars are usually a payoff for something else (e.g. other movies, or a bitter divorce to Tom Cruise). Diane Lane in Unfaithful was WAY better that year. Other than that, Ed Harris and Streep were good, and did what they could, but this movie is a flop.",The Hours
143,VivienLeighsnumber1fan,An Oscar to All Three!,10,13 February 2003,"To me, the premise of ""The Hours"" was a little intimidating to me before I finally managed to see the film: Three women are linked through three time periods to Virginia Woolf's novel 'Mrs. Dalloway'. I was concerned that my blazing ignorance to Ms. Woolf's work, and this one in particular, would hinder my enjoyment of the film and my ability to understand it. Not so. Yes, 'Mrs. Dalloway' was at the root of the three stories presented, but everything you need to know is in the film. This is it, basically: Mrs. Dalloway decides one morning -- the morning of a party she is throwing -- that she will buy the flowers herself. Though she projects the appearance of togetherness and cheer, she is a lonely, empty woman inside. Oh, and someone dies at the end. That's it.In ""The Hours"", we meet three women. First is Virginia herself (Nicole Kidman), and our introduction comes in the form of her 1941 suicide at the age of 59. A feminist Ophelia, she places a stone in her dress pocket, walks to a nearby stream, and lets it carry her away. Her brief, mortal stroll is voiced-over by her suicide letter, which explains to her husband that this act of desperation is to spare him the madness she feels is returning. The rest of her story takes place in 1923 as 'Mrs. Dalloway' is working its way out of her. Flashing forward to 1951, we see Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), depressed housewife of WWII veteran Dan (John C. Reilly) and mother of a young son. It's Dan's birthday, and Laura, in the middle of reading 'Mrs. Dalloway', decides that she will feel better today and bake a cake. Cut to 2001, and publisher Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is preparing a reception for author and friend (and long-ago lover) Richard (Ed Harris). Richard has just won a prestigious poetry award but is too ill from AIDS and related dementia to want to go to the party.Each of these women are depressed. Each awakes and acquires flowers. Each has something special going on that day -- a party of sorts. Each of these women kisses another woman. They all face suicide, and they all face the choice between death and the imprisonment of life. They each make a choice. The variations on these choices, while sometimes disorienting, are exactingly faithful to each other. Sometimes they reveal themselves suddenly, consecutively. Other times they surface gradually, inconspicuously. Like Philip Glass' subtle, driving score, they build gracefully from a whisper into a cry and by film's end find themselves whispering again.""The Hours"" is a miracle of a movie. Literate, involving, active -- it is that rare film about women and their unique experiences that neither excludes nor condemns the role of men in their lives. The men of ""The Hours"", Woolf' stoic and supportive husband (Stephen Dillane), Brown's husband and son, poet Richard, and his former lover Louis (Jeff Daniels) -- the sexual politics of the film are sometimes scattered but fascinating -- are innocent bystanders who, while making decisions to maintain or find their own happiness, neither victims nor devalue these unhappy women. Their depressions are unto themselves, and their lives entrap them in ways that their respective others cannot assist or understand.All of the performances in ""The Hours"" are excellent, uniquely extraordinary, and utterly unforgettable. Ms. Kidman, unrecognizable behind a prosthetic nose, does more refined work here than I have ever seen from her. Her Woolf is depressed but never pitiful and always strong whatever the hardship. Ms. Moore, playing a very different '50s housewife from her ""Far From Heaven"" turn, gets it just right. In the midst of true depression, something as simple as baking a cake becomes an overwhelming, impossible task. Moore's battle with the cake is heartbreakingly sorrowful when she fails, yet somehow sadder when she gets it right. Ms. Streep, meanwhile, shows us again why she is Streep -- equally profound unraveling before the party and, in a devastating scene at the end, as she just listens to a voice from the past that puts things into perspective.Sad, but never far from hope, ""The Hours"" not only also has an outstanding supporting cast (including Claire Danes, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson) and superb direction from Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot""), it is also one of the finest films of 2003 and of recent memory.

I mean, I get that, I really do.But oh my god was I bored watching this, to me, pointless and depressing monotone of a film where nothing happened and nobody smiled. If you liked this film - great.

145,steve.schonberger,Hours and Hours,6,8 February 2003,"I haven't read the book, or anything by Virginia Woolf, so my impressions may differ from viewers who have read _The Hours_ or Woolf's writings.The movie has three parallel stories.  One is set in the 1920s, and focuses on the historic Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman, difficult to recognize with the prosthetic nose and frumpy clothing), with her husband (Stephen Dillane) as the only important supporting character.  Another is set in the 1950s, and focuses on a woman (Julianne Moore) who appears to have a happy life situation, but is nonetheless visibly melancholy.  The third is set in modern New York City, and focuses on a woman (Meryl Streep) who is a close friend of a man (Ed Harris, also difficult to recognize) who is suffering gravely from AIDS.I found the historic story line dull from start to end, with the exception of the opening scene, where Woolf drowns herself, hinting that the remainder of her story line will tell us more about _why_ she eventually kills herself.  Her story line showed us _that_ she was miserable to the point of suicide, and indicates that she's suffering from what we'd now call clinical depression, but I never felt like the movie took us inside her suffering. Instead, it was like watching someone suffer, without ever understanding the misery or being able to do anything about it.  I could feel empathy with her husband, but I felt like the movie was trying to take us inside _her_ without success, rather than trying to show us her suffering from her husband's viewpoint.The modern story was similarly dull during the beginning of the movie, but got more involving as it progressed.  In the beginning, we could see that the sick man, a noted poet, was miserable and depressed because his illness was getting worse in spite of his medicine.  Streep's character was putting her life on hold emotionally in her efforts to comfort him.  She was planning a big party to celebrate the poet's receipt of a major poetry award.  The story became more interesting with the introduction of some supporting characters, but only really took off when Streep's character went to pick up the poet for the party.  That set interesting events into motion, and brought in a very interesting supporting character.The only part of story that had me hooked from the start was the one set in the 1950s.  In that one, Moore's character was gloomy, for no obvious reason -- she didn't even appear to be clinically depressed or otherwise unhealthy, mentally or physically.  Her children were the envy of a friend who visited her.  Her husband seemed to be nice, and they appeared to be living a comfortable life.  The story grabbed me by setting up the nature of her unhappiness a mystery, and the story stayed interesting by showing what she did as a result of her sadness.Now that I've complained about how dull more than half of the story was, I have to praise some things that were good about the movie.  The acting was outstanding, and deserves lots of award nominations, even the great acting that went to waste in the dull parts of the movie.  The three female leads were amazing, and Ed Harris was impressive too.  The directing was impressive in a number of ways, notably the cuts between story lines, but when the directing technique is more interesting than some of the story lines, the directing should have kept looking for a way to keep the story itself interesting.I usually don't notice the score, but in this case I noticed it, found it a bit intrusive.  It sounded like every other Phil Glass composition I have heard, which might be interesting a few times, outside the context of a movie, but didn't work for me in this case.  If you like Phil Glass, you might like the score separately, but I would not have chosen it for this movie.I left out some giant spoilers, because they would not make this review more interesting for those who aren't seeing the movie.  If you think you might see the movie, be careful to avoid spoilers from other sources, because they're likely to hurt this movie more than most.",The Hours
146,bobbyf,Suicide is never brave...,6,9 July 2003,"This movie, the whole story, is a horrid tale of self-absorbed selfish people who are miserable because they seek to live for and serve themselves rather thanlive for and serve others. Mother's abandoning children and husbands to pursue their sexual desiresrather than live out the commitment they made at the altar. Husbands who areso blinded by circumstances and living the ""happy"" life that they miss theirspouses true emotional distress. Ex-lovers who would rather commit suicidewhen faced with trials (self-inflicted, btw) than live out their lives, giving to others. Even the one character who seemed to care for others was doing it for herself, trying to regain a lost happiness- brought to an emotional low when confronted with the man her ex-lover chose over her- disregarding those who love her soshe can have the unattainable.

I found a jewel, one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The acting was stunning, and made all the more interesting because of the way some actors are used for parts vastly different from their ""usual"" parts (Ed Harris, often the solid hero, cast as a poet dying of AIDS; Nicole Kidman, normally the beautiful woman, cast as the ugly and manly Virginia Woolf - though even with make-up she cannot quite match the ugliness of the photos of the real Virginia). The pace was wonderfully well done, precise - not once did I feel that they could have switched from one of the three parallel stories to the next in a different way, that the pace would have been better. Words are not enough - this is a clear masterpiece.Antoine",The Hours
148,spinbunny,A Triumph of Female Acting!,9,25 January 2003,"Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman are three of the best actreses out there --- they all shine brilliantly in this film --- Michael Cunningham's novel does them justice and they triumph but the movie is so hard to take in at once: the acting is so amazing. All three women play strong characters in settings decades apart linked by the Virginia Woolfe novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Nicole Kidman plays Virginia Woolfe as she struggles with her sanity writing the novel --- it is an amazing and strong performance. (once you get over the physical transformation). Julianne Moore plays a 1950s housewife struggling with her sanity as she reads ""Mrs. Dalloway"" --- Meryl Streep plays a 1990s career woman nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway --- two more stellar performances.As the movie cuts back and forth between the three women (AMAZING EDITING!!!) I kept wanting the movie to be longer and to show more of these women's lives. I felt shortchanged, almost --- the movie was amazing but I wanted to get to know these women more --- I didn't want HOURS, I wanted days, weeks, months --- I wanted to get to know them more and find out why they ticked they way they did.Supporting characters only gave a glimpse into their lives, but the cast that played these people were amazing --- Allison Janney, the uncomparable John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Ed Harris --- I felt short-changed when the movie ended as I felt that I wanted to know more about these three amazing women and their lives and what happened to make them that way.Oscar will be kind to this movie...no doubt about that.

149,jvdesuit1,A fantastic movie,10,5 May 2012,I saw this movie in Paris when it was released and it made a terrible impression on me. In fact seeing again on the DVD tonight I realized why. In fact I found that I was myself somehow in the situation of one of the characters and was on the verge of making a very significant decision. I remember that I left the cinema in tears unable to control myself. That was horrible. For me perhaps the most important character of the movie is young Richard. The women can be classified in 2 categories Virginia and Richard's mother are destructive. Virginia destroys her husband's life and Laura destroys both husband and kids. Richard as an adult is not only self destructive but too destroys his friends as is mentioned by his ex boyfriend. The only one who escapes not too seriously damaged is Clarissa. For 9 years I did not dare to see the movie again fearing to face again the same state of depression I had in 2003. I decided this evening to make the attempt and everything became clear. The decision I made 9 years ago was in fact the one I had to take to get out of all the problems of the time. Some of the reviews here have surprised me. To say the characters are not consistent is the most stupid comment to ever write on such a movie. Stephen Daldree made a splendid film like he did previously with Billy Elliott.,The Hours

152,taikman,For all it's craft and quality it loses it's power through too much heavy emotion.,7,9 March 2003,"The Hours' is a strange film: sad, intelligent, expertly crafted and superbly acted, it should be great, but it adds up to less than the sum of its parts.The film focuses on three women living parallel lives in different times and places during the last eighty years. In the 1920s Virginia Woolf (an unrecognizable Nicole Kidman) is writing her novel Mrs Dalloway', which is about a hostess who is hiding how empty she feels behind a mask of happiness, much like 1950s housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) and modern-day socialite Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep). All are locked into suffocating relationships with men who do not understand them, except for Clarissas ex-lover, the dying poet Richard Brown (Ed Harris), who understands all too well. There are other themes running through the womens' lives: emotional repression, bisexuality, parenthood and above all suicide. Director Stephen Daldry does a good job of visually showing how the women echo each other  they look into mirrors, depressed at what they see there, flowers are arranged and moved, food is created and destroyed. A strong image is that of eggs being broken, for the women lead eggshell lives  strong on the surface but fragile and liable to break into shards. Other images also linger, as this is a very well shot film: a woman walking into a river, the terrible arid neatness of Laura's house, a child's judging eyes, water flooding a hotel room. Daldry also draws out nuanced and powerful performances from his actors, though you would expect them from such a talented cast. As well as Harris and the three leads it also includes John C. Reilly, who seems to be in every good film out at the moment, Toni Collette, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Dillane in a complex, touching role as Woolf's husband Leonard. The actors are given a good script to work with too. Particularly poignant are some lines between the Woolf's.Leonard: In your novel. Why does somebody have to die?' Virginia: So that others will value life more. It is necessary  for contrast.'But for all the good things about it, The Hours' does not reach the level of emotional power it aspires to. Paradoxically it feels both overcharged and too slow, because we are hit by too much of the same things. The Hours' is nearly all painfully shallow conversation or emotional turmoil  there are hardly any light moments to catch your breath or build up the tension for the next big scene. Watching it is like listening to a symphony that is all crescendos  no matter how moving they are they feel flat after a while.7/10",The Hours
153,MrWhite2,An Outstanding Work of Art!,9,27 March 2003,"This film is most likely one of the best films to come along in years. Every aspect of this movie just shines with perfection. The writing is intruiging,the directing is great, but the thing that really stands out is the acting: Three great female performances are givien by Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Also Ed Harris gives such a pure and magnificent peformance that he deserved the Oscar. The story is kind of complex. The story takes place in three time periods (1923, 1951 and 2001) and each story stars each of the leading ladies. The First story is set in 1923, when writer Virgina Woolf (Nicole Kidman in her Academy Award Winning performance) is writing her book ""Mrs. Dalloway"", which is about a depressed woman trying to plan a party. While writing the book Virgina suffers severe depression, and ends up commiting suicide by walking into a river with rocks in her pockets after she finishes her novel. The Second story is set in 1951 where a depressed house-wife (Julianne Moore) is planning a little party for her husband (John C. Reilly) while reading Virgina Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". She really relates to the book, because like Virgina, the author, she also feels the same way she did. The Third story is set in 2001, and is about a lesbian woman (Meryl Streep) who is planning a party for her dear homosexual friend dying from the AIDS virus. During this, she realizes she is living the same life as Mrs. Dalloway in Virgina Woolf's book. The film is filled with great scenes and interesting plot twists. The only downside is the severe depression of this film. I have seen an uncountable number of films in my life so far, but this is by far the most depressing movie I have ever seen in my entire life! That is counting the holocaust movies! Do not go see this if you are in a bad mood, because you'll probably end up crying or questioning the meaning of life on the car ride home.Alot of people say this is a chick flick, but this film couldn't be more far from a chick flick. The thing this film contains the most of is people wanting or trying to commit suicide and girls kissing each other (in all three stories; Virgina kisses her stepsister on the lips in the first story; Julianne Moore kisses her female friend on the lips after she tells Julianne Moore she has a tumor in her uturus; Meryl Streep briefly kisses her girlfriend played by Allison Janney). The film is a memorable art house film, but again very depressing. See at your own risk. Grade: A.",The Hours
154,unbend_5440,"Directors, take lessons from Stephen Daldry",10,8 March 2004,"Of the 5 best picture nominated movies at The Oscars, The Hours was the most deserving. Stephen Daldry should've won best director just for making an incredibly difficult concept work. Daldry has proven with this and Billy Elliot that he can make original movies that can't be compared to anything else. He builds the story and tension like someone who's been making movies for decades. I was shocked at how tense I was when watching this. During all the scenes with tension, Daldry did something so unusual. He built tension based on unimportant background noise. Cracking of eggs, a printing press slamming, chopping on a cutting board. This trick works so well. I am surprised that Nicole Kidman got the Oscar for lead actress when there are 3 lead roles. What makes this even more confusing is that Kidman probably had less screentime and dialogue than Moore and Streep. As for the performances, I thought all 3 deserved to be nominated, but Julianne Moore's more subtle performance was more intriguing to me. Phillip Glass' music is a little too overpowering at times, but it definitely qualifies as some of the best music I've heard in a long time. I appreciate that Glass didn't write separate themes for each character. Using the same theme throughout works because this is a movie where you have 3 totally different stories, that are connected by similar events and story themes being used. The Hours is unique and fascinating during every moment. This was one of the first times I've seen a movie and been literally captivated every second. Thank you to Stephen Daldry for making one of the only movies this decade that deserves to be reffered to as a masterpiece.",The Hours

The woman cannot act, even with a false and badly pasted on fake nose in this strange and very sickening movie about depression. Don't watch this piece of garbage unless you vote Democrat, believe what Obama says in his speeches and are a dyed in the wool liberal who loves weepy stories with women kissing each other a lot. Kidman would never have won the Best Actress Oscar if there was any rational thought to the Academy Awards, which there isn't, as it is a liberal love fest (think Sean Penn's two Oscars for dismal, sickening movies).

The particular circumstances change but people typically fail to fulfill others' (and their own) expectations, and those who survive learn to cope. Physical and mental disease provide more tangible obstacles. There is an implication that Woolf's life and writings have helped some readers avoid her fate.

But the music was a monumental distraction: a repetitive, intrusive overlay that tried to shape the viewers emotions and interfered with the unfolding stories. The only story appropriate music, was the full volume Opera that was blasting in the background as Clarissa Vaughn was preparing for her party.

This suffocatingly morbid and joyless film might best be viewed by condemned criminals as they may afterwards fight the executioner for the right to throw the switch on their electric chair.It's rather like watching a horse-race between three plot lines as each competes to be the most depressing. Who will win? Nicole Kidman's criminally self-involved Virginia Wolf hysterically berating her husband for having the unmitigated nerve to move her to the countryside? Or will it be Julianne Moore's suicidal housewife slowly eating her heart out over her failed marriage and letting her son pay for her inaction. Perhaps it will be Meryl Streep's impotent caretaker presiding over the last tortured days of Ed Harris' crumbling AIDS victim.Yes, folks, it's a non-stop laugh-o-rama.Maybe it'll interest you to see how these plot lines interweave over time and unfold through an interconnected history of pain and desperation.But if you're like me, you'll find your brain has decided to step out mid way for a Foghorn Leghorn cartoon on TV somewhere.Drama fails to compell or even convince when all the news is either bad or mundane. Would it have been too much to ask for ONE redeemable male character? Will the cinematic deconstruction of the 1950s, an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity, EVER end?

159,highkite,Beautiful and Inspiring,8,8 June 2006,"The Hours is a web of imagination and an example of how some lives affect and/or parallel others. It is about the tragedy of life and how one day can be both beautiful and tragic. The story centers around Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman in her Oscar-winning performance), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore -- nominated for Best Supporting Actress) and Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep, who was snubbed for a nomination). Woolf's story is the drive for the other two stories, taking place in the 1920s as she writes her famous book ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" which closely resembles the life of the two juxtaposed stories. As Virginia writes ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" we are exposed to constant indifferences of how Clarissa and Laura's life mimic that of Dalloway.The story starts off with Virginia Woolf in 1941 walking towards a lake, putting rocks into her pockets. We hear a voice-over narration of her troubled-sounding voice as she writes a suicide letter for her loving husband. Switch over to 1951 and we see Laura Brown, a suburban wife and mother in Los Angeles. For anyone who knows the story of Mrs. Dalloway will find that Laura's story almost perfectly resembles the book. She wakes up, has breakfast, and prepares for a party. A quick flashforward 50 years later, and it's 2001, where we meet Clarissa Vaughan, a lesbian who lives with her lover and daughter, and takes care of her best friend and ex husband (who is now gay and has AIDS). Her day also follows that of Mrs. Dalloway and we quickly learn the deep complexity of her character. She is frightened yet confident, questioning her own lesbian nature.Themes rise, as concern over self-freedom is blatantly suffocating the three women. Also we see themes of feminism, self-pity, concern, and of course death. As two successful suicides are brought up, more and more tragic moments arise. The stories intertwine through both the book and reoccurring characters in different eras. An emotional impact sends all three stories to contemplate self-destruction but fail to do so because of concern for others' satisfaction.The acting is without a doubt, superb, if not flawless. Kidman portrays Virginia Woolf in an almost uncanny way. We see her transform into a factual character, making us feel we are really looking at the author herself. Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep brilliantly capture troubled women who face their own fate by escaping what they're forced to love. No matter which segment we're watching, the acting sucks us in and provokes our thoughts. Ed Harris who plays Richard Brown gained an Oscar nomination with his sympathetic approach to an AIDS infected gay man who loves his female best friend. As his character shows signs of retraction from his sexuality, we realize that a traumatic experience with his mother and her friend sent him to a life-long confusion.Deservingly acclaimed, The Hours is a perfect movie. It shows both sentiment and believability about our modern life, and society in the early 20th century. Three main destinations mark life for the characters: New York, Los Angeles and England, making the inevitable thought of class struggle apparent.The directing takes you places you've never been and adds a sort of subtle cinematic voyeurism about the life of three women and their surrounding loved ones. An approach to modern cinema we were all waiting for.To create a movie so beautiful, so cinematic and so well-written is to be genius. The Hours sends the viewer through the 20th century in an almost deliberately transitional manner, complete with editing that can both be spotted and denied.Definitely a movie to be inspired by, and definitely one of the best movies of 2002, The Hours pays homage to all the great legends of cinema achievement while carefully portraying a masterpiece.

The emotionally charged performances, the poetic dialogue, the enigmatic symbolism and the silky contrast between 3 women, 3 time periods, 3 lives stringed along so eloquently, makes this story so simple, yet so powerful. Underneath that beautiful surface, lies the perspective of death, and the meaning of life. The topic of lesbian love, AIDS, the love of literature and fated acts of lives connected. All of this takes places while the concepts of mental illness and physical ailments take place in the lives of 3 women connected by fate, love, despair, duty and death.To call this a film shortchanges the work of cinematic art and poetry in front of us. It is till date, the most brilliant and beautiful film I've seen, and although its theme is demure, its meaning is profound.Signaling one performance is a group of tour de forces is a tough challenge, but Nicole Kidman's Virginia Wolf would break any heart with her undeniable raw portrayal of sadness, loneliness and desperation.

163,politicon2003,The Hours and Virginia Wolf's Concept of Time,9,27 September 2005,"The Hours is a somewhat mystic film in which the lives of three women living in different decades during a period of eighty years - from 1921 to 2001- are somehow entwined. The only woman who is a real is character is Virginia Woolf - admirably played by a scarcely recognisable Nicole Kidman. Miss Kidman is arguably playing her best ever role that I have ever seen in her films. One comes to the ultimate conclusion that the other women are possibly posthumous creations of Virginia Woolf's spirit. It would spoil the film for the reader of this review to go into details. It is not a film for everyone but I found it very moving. It is a sad tale but paradoxically one does not feel sad watching it-perhaps because its ending is subtly uplifting. I have never read any of Virginia Woolf's works aside from published extracts from her letters and watching the movie based on her book Orlando, but after watching The Hours I looked up a reference to her works in Meriam Webster's, Encyclopedia of Literature, which includes the following comment : ""She was also interested in the way time is experienced both as a sequence of disparate moments and as a flow of year and centuries"". In retrospect The Hours catches the essence of her time concepts very well. Also more obviously apparent in the film Orlando.The cinematography of The Hours is superb and the cast is excellent. Meryl Streep acts the 2001 character of Mrs Dalloway (also the title of a Virginia Woolf novel) and her role provides the hidden links upon which the carefully crafted tale of the film hangs. The only flaw, in my opinion is the poor choice of the musical background, it doesn't seem to fit the mood of the movie at all and is repetitive and annoying.For the sake of being picky there are also some oddities in the final credits. Oh , I know few people bother with the them, but I am one of those who do. Why does the film have so many stunt men? Why any at all? It's not an action film? Possibly for the scene where one of the woman drives her car recklessly down a Los Angeles Highway in 1951? I just can't envisage what the stunts men were needed for? Also the usual disclaimer that the characters portrayed are entirely fictitious surely does not apply to the characters of Virginia and Leonard Woolf? I lived in Richmond Surrey for a year and that is definitely not Richmond Railway Station or any other station of the Southern Railway!",The Hours

167,denizov,A wonderful film!,9,15 February 2011,"Few films have moved me so much as ""The Hours"". Many good things can be said about this deeply emotional and highly original drama.The plot transcends time and space to show the existential agony of Man (or more precise of Woman). It combines the real character (Virginia Woolf) with two fictitious ones who seem to be characters out of Woolf's own books. Death,madness and suicide are never away from all three main characters, making the plot very, very tense emotionally.It is a film which should be watched very carefully as there are numerous, seemingly petty details, which, however, are of great importance in understanding the meaning of the whole complex story(or stories which intertwine and ""mirror"" one another) to create a vast philosophical panorama of human Life. I am not ashamed to admit that by my second viewing of the film, I ""caught"" lots of details that I have missed at the first viewing. Perhaps the best thing about the film is that it is a PHILOSOPHICAL one. This is so rare in cinema which has always been more of an entertainment, rather than art. As I am a great admirer of literature and consider it the greatest genre in art, I enjoyed very much this respect towards literature as shown in the film through the fate of Virginia Woolf. Art imitates Life but the opposite is also true:often Life imitates Art fulfilling its forecasts.For example the scene when Woolf plans that her heroine Mrs. Dallaway "" to kill herself over something trivial"" almost becomes reality with Mrs. Brown.Basically the problems confronting people emotionally stay the same through the ages--only the clocks change,but Time doesn't because everything is repeated again and again.Also, another aspect of the film that I enjoyed:almost all characters in the film make great sacrifices for the ones who they love. It is precisely this love that makes them struggle heroically with the complexities and burden of life. True, they fail in the end: Clarissa couldn't stop Richard from committing suicide, Laura abandons both her children and Virginia Woolf couldn't stand the difficulty to live at the end. But without this love these deaths would have happened much sooner.I like that people are presented in their complex relationships with other people. We sometimes tend to forget that Art is above all the analyzing of human RELATIONSHIPS in all their complexities. And you may ask me why after all these praises I gave 9 and not 10? The answer is that I was irritated by the three erotic kisses in the film. Call me old-fashioned if you like but I do think that the introduction of sexuality in such a film is totally inappropriate. Art is about the soul, not the body. Not to mention the fact that such a sexual drive is psychologically untrue in these scenes. One of modern culture's greatest sins is this over-celebration of the human body and of sexuality at the expense of the spiritual. Too much sex, too little love--this is what we have today in painting, literature,cinema... I guess these scenes are present in the film because Mr. Cunningham is openly gay. Still, I do find it inappropriate in such a film that is preoccupied with the subtlest feelings of the human soul, to spoil it with cheap sex although these kisses look innocent enough compared to what I have seen in other films. It is only because of this that I refrained from giving 10. I must also say that all three actresses deserve an Oscar for these very demanding roles.The film is very good but the book is even greater and an absolute must for lovers of art and literature in my opinion.",The Hours

Few films deal with the innermost demons of depesssed people like this one. The connection of the three women is somewhat a bit pointless, but I felt it gave the film a rare distinction in trying to connect lives in different generations- simply we are all the same, trying to live our lives to the fulllest by lying to ourselves - its something we all go through at one time in our lives. All the performances are great, from Kidman and Moore as well as Streep. The ending is somewhat a bit unsettles however, I would have liked to see what happened after that.

171,hypersquared,A kick in the gut from the spirit of human potential.,7,22 January 2003,"The best place to start in discussing `The Hours,' I think, is to recap the discussion I had with my friend just after the movie. While she agreed with me that it was an excellent film, both in the obvious level of craft on display (the performances, the writing, the design, the score, et al, are uniformly excellent, but more on that later) and in its success at lighting up the grey matter in our skulls, our emotional reactions were polar opposites. She found herself utterly sad and depressed afterward, regarding the three intertwining stories as tales of entrapment; of people in the tragic position of suffering from the very things that might otherwise make them happy. I felt inspired and empowered by the film, finding a great sense of hope in the insights (or more correctly, the one insight) that the various characters come to.(If you're the kind of person, like I am, who finds the personal revelations of characters to be just as rewarding as any specific plot point or twist, you'd consider much of the following to be spoilers, so consider yourself warned.)My friend was right that all the primary characters in `The Hours,' the three top-billed women, as well as Ed Harris' Richard, are living out their lives in some kind of pen. Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) suffers from clinical depression and a husband who confines her comings and goings out of his own well-intended concern. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) lives the archetypical existence of a bored 1950s housewife according to an ideal dreamed up by her husband and post-War America at large. Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) suffers from chronic nostalgia, and her ex-boyfriend, Richard, from AIDS. The story follows each of them over the course of a single day in their own era -- Woolf in the 20s, Brown in the 50s, and Vaughn in the present day -- in which they grapple with the realities of their entrapment. Ultimately all of them figure out how to distinguish between the elements of their lives that they cannot change (their circumstances) and the things that they can (their options), and find that once that distinction has been made, they have the most that anyone can ask for: the equipment to participate in their own fate.What an amazing thing to discover, that no matter how limited our choices become we still have choices to make -- sometimes, brutally tough and even unfair choices  -- but  that the success of our lives can be measured by how well we make the choices we do have!  Even when the most you can decide for yourself are the details of your own death, if you discover how to die on no one else's terms, you have made the most of what it is to be human. And so here is where my friend's and my reactions diverged. I find this revelation beautiful and inspiring, and I left the theater feeling I had been kicked in the gut by the spirit of human potential.Miles of column inches have already been printed in praise of the work done in `The Hours' by the three lead actresses and their various supporters. There's little I can add to that praise, except that, while Streep and Moore are doing work that is very much in keeping with the kind that we've seen them do before, Kidman as Woolf is a miraculous piece of counter-intuitive casting. This one role comes close to suggesting that Kidman might be capable of anything. Woolf, in Kidman's portrayal, is hushed and tightly enveloped around herself, quietly resentful of her own madness, the depth of which she is more aware of than anyone around her. With the aid of a single bit of prosthetic makeup (about which far more has been discussed than seems necessary), Kidman disappears entirely into the role.Under Stephen Daldry's direction, the craftsmanship in `The Hours' is stunning at every level. Peter Boyle, the editor, gracefully balances the three narratives and deftly places the visual motifs that connect them. Phillip Glass' score breathes beautifully throughout, introducing a greater degree of melodic interplay than he's been known for in his more rarified art pieces. Seamus Garvey photographs each of the narratives in a distinct palette, letting us never lose track of where we are in time, and still allowing the film to feel cohesive and whole.If I have one quibble with `The Hours,' it is that the 1950s story is designed and staged according to a set of well-established archetypes of that particular time and place: everyone exists in a kind of Stepford paralysis, baked in painfully sunny weather. Clichés are, of course, rooted in truth. I'd have been happier, though, to see some of the naturalism of the other two stories bleed over into this section as well.It is a minor complaint about a major piece of work. Of the films being discussed as potential Oscar winners, it is by far my favorite for the Best Picture prize, as well as a number of others. An `Hours' sweep would strike a blow, unprecedented in recent memory, for gorgeous and inspiring film making.",The Hours
172,dbracco86,Very good,9,21 February 2003,"This movie was excellently done.  While I don't think it's quite Best Picture, it was well directed and acted. I've heard many different opinions on which actress stole the movie.  After hearing the things about Julianne Moore and seeing Far From Heaven, I was expecting her to dominate.She didn't.Nicole Kidman is what this movie is all about.  Even when she is doing nothing (which happens a little too frequently), it's captivating.  Julianne Moore didn't turn on the acting ability until the last scene with her, and by then it was too little too late.  I can understand why she got a nomination for SUPPORTING, but I don't think she should win.Meryl Streep was second best in this film.  She was her usual great self.I think Kidman has outdone herself these last few years, with three completely different (and amazing) films: Moulin Rouge, The Others, and The Hours.  WOW!In short, Julianne Moore was OK (the little boy stole all the scenes from her...as did every other character), but Kidman acted the best.  I was dissapointed to find out Streep wasn't nominated, but I think she acted better in Adaptation anyway.Basically, it was a great movie.  Very depressing, and slow, but very well done.  9/10",The Hours
173,dbracco86,Good,9,15 March 2003,"And by good, that means the average of the amazing Nicole Kidman with the poor Julianne Moore.  Best Actress?  No.  It should go to Julianne Moore for ""Far From Heaven,"" BUT Julianne Moore was borderline terrible in this movie for me.  I was expecting greatness and I got cue-card reading. The movie itself was...good...a little disappointing considering how great everyone said it was.  I mean, it was just--good.  Like I said, without Kidman, the movie would've been headed for a Razzie (and Moore should get one for this movie).",The Hours
174,JaysonT,A flashy homage to strong women,9,7 August 2009,"Stephen Daldry's ""The Hours"" is a more a tribute to fine editing and abrasive situations then a true storyline. Set in three different time periods (1921, 1949, 2001), you will follow three women all sharing a similar experience.Nicole Kidman, who won the Best Actress Oscar, is Virginia Woolf, who is writing a story about a woman buying flowers for a party. Julianne Moore is a bored housewife reading Woolf's book and experiencing the same ordeals. And Meryl Streep is actually living the life of the woman in the book, in the process of planning a party for AIDS victim Ed Harris, who is also her ex-husband.This all sounds too juicy to be true (and probably a perfect cloud 9 experience for the author its based on, who won the Pulizter Prize- did I spell that right?) The music, by Phillip Glass, is imperative but gorgeous, and the editing is probably the best part of the movie. Though the story itself is dark and depressing, the performances are so immaculate it should be noted that this was probably one of the best casts of 2002- if not the 2000s. With Miranda Richardson, John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Jeff Daniels, Margo Martindale and Claire Danes just to name a few, you should impend yourself on a movie-going experience unlike no other.So which of the three main leads deserved all the acclaim? Well all of them do a pretty damn good job. Even Streep, who feels a bit exhausting here since she's just so ABOVE the rest of her co-stars in the way she inhibits her sadness and then breaks down in her kitchen (""I seem to be unraveling"" she says to Daniels, her ex's new lover).Julianne Moore does a good dose of underacting, with that dry, isolated characterization she usually churns up that critics seem to like (it didn't work for her in ""Hannibal"" though, where she just came across boring). She's an unhappy wife married to John C. Reilly, and raising a child (soon to be Harris) even though she doesn't love anything in her life. She abandons it all to go find her true calling (apparently being a lesbian). It's all fine, but her character is quite hat able.Finally there's Nicole Kidman, fresh off her ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""The Others"" acclaim, and Tom Cruise divorce. Here she seems to know all the boundaries of Woolf, and all the right facial expressions. She confabulates with a perfect British accent, and speaks in low and crippled whispers as if she is playing Norman Bates roommate. None the less it's quite exhilarating and fun to watch, and it is indeed the Kidman segments that reign the most watchable, if only because there are such limited scenes. Virginia Woolf, a proclaimed bisexual and genius of her time, committed suicide as more of a spiritual undoing then anything. If Kidman's work as the famous author is proof that she indeed HAD the potential of being the next Katharine Hepburn (and I think she did until she did ""Bewitched"" with Will Ferrell), then we all should be applauding the academy on its decision to knight her their highest honor.""The Hours"" is not for the frat boy who likes John Woo action films or the stoners who like ""Superbad""- this is a movie for which mostly mature women and gay audiences will find the most sympathy.FINAL GRADE: A-",The Hours
175,POG-2,"good acting, but not convinced of the story",8,30 March 2003,"The acting is truly excellent and I think that the other women beside Nicole Kidman were very strong, too, but the story itself didn't convince me. A friend went with me who went through a phase like that it seems and she was moved to tears, so it may be a matter of empathy. I think it's some of the lines that put me off. They were so bookish, so kind of this-is-art, so forced. I've read a Cunningham story and wasn't impressed with that either. So maybe I'm just not on that wave length. Anyway, as true as the acting may be, the story didn't ring true for me.",The Hours

Despite the presence of the always terrific Julianne Moore (forced to play an elderly woman here while Nicole Kidman as the 56-year old Virginia Woolf wears only her fake nose without a wrinkle in sight), this is still to be avoided. They really ought to be offering it ""With Score"" and ""Without Score"" so that we might actually view the drama on it's own merits.  Miranda Richardson and Toni Collette offer fine support as well but it still makes for a strangely unengaging experience.

Very rarely have I seen such a film that tells multiple stories, in different time periods and geographic locations, like this movie did.There are connections with all three of the major characters, played by Meryly Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore, who all could have been nominated for Best Actress as they all played equal roles in this film.

180,vivalarsx,Rebuttal,10,1 March 2003,"I have been reading the overwhelmingly negative comments herein and felt the need to add my thoughts.  ""The Hours"" is one of the most profoundly moving films I have ever seen.  Anyone looking for thoughtful, intelligent, and meaty drama should run to the nearest theater to check it out.  It is absolutely amazing to me that someone would see this movie and hate it (have already had this argument with my sister, who did).  I don't mean to imply that ""getting"" it and loving it makes one superior to those who don't--I am simply dumbfounded that anyone could hate it!  ""The Hours"" is near-perfect (only a slight slowing down near the end--the time after the party is cancelled--was less than superb to me).  The acting is flawless; the performers deliver their lines in a consistent, stylized tone that allows one to not only ""feel"" the performance, but to look at it from an intellectual perspective as well.  I am that rare freak who finds Meryl Streep's reputation as the ""greatest living actress"" hugely undeserved (she bugs the hell out of me--ever notice how she suddenly pauses and takes breaths in the middle of her sentences--grr!!), but her performance in this movie I loved.  Her big moment in the kitchen, as she just starts coming apart and doesn't know why, IS great acting; she should drop her mannerisms and just give us real moments like this more often.  Julianne Moore has to convey much through mood and expression, and does so beautifully. Of course, Nicole Kidman is the real ""star"" here, and she does something not only beautiful but rare:  shows us an intelligent character THINKING, and makes it interesting.  Phillip Glass's music was exquisite--great to listen to, and also in character!  Don't be put off by the comments of those who kept waiting for the chase scene and the car explosion--""The Hours"" is literate, spellbinding, adult entertainment (yes I use that word intentionally) for those tired of the same old-same old.",The Hours
181,Evolvist,Sleeping Through The Hours,7,11 July 2003,"What an awesome multi-layered story!  What a great host of actresses and actors!  What a great performance by Nicole Kidman!  Nevertheless (whether I am shortchanging myself or not), there were deeper implications: deeper levels to this movie that I did not care to sink my teeth into.  Forget the fact that you could see the line of demarcation in Nicole's false nose (aren't the big bucks paid to makeup artists to detect such obvious flubs?); and forget the fact that this movie is the most depressing flick that I have seen in recent memory.  Right, wrong, or indifferent, I simply could not bare to go further than the layers the movie presented on a superficial basis.     Having said that:  Taking nothing away from Daniel Day-Lewis in `Gangs of New York,' (my personal choice for best actor of 2002), when will Ed Harris get a best actor Oscar?  The guy was brilliant in `The Hours'-not to mention the fact that he just keeps getting better with time.     *A Special Note* I don't know if anybody realized this or not, but John C. Riley's character in `The Hours' was explaining to his son how when he was in World War II, fighting in the south pacific, he thought of his son's mother the whole time.  Well, in `The Thin Red Line' John C. Riley played a soldier fighting on Guadalcanal, in the south pacific in WWII.

Fast forward to 16 years later, I watched it again yesterday, and was blown away. This is not a movie that would appeal to the masses. I understand now why I didn't get it when I watched it 16 years ago. This is a movie about life choices, the consequences, the effects those choices have upon the decision maker, other people, and their surroundings. The movie tries to capture intense feelings and emotions that can really be understood once you've experienced them yourself. Hence, the reason the movie doesn't have context or real story.The 20 year old me didn't understand the movie because at the time I only had limited experiences in life. Haven't had to make difficult life choices, haven't had to deal with a lot of things on my own. (But life itself is funny, the more experience you have of it, the less you understand it). Having finished the movie also made me feel sad, sad to know that I might not be able to see a movie that is able to capture those intense feelings and emotions like this movie did, probably ever again.",The Hours
184,Edd-N-Furter,You can't find peace by avoiding life,10,26 April 2010,"All the decisions we make in life have consequences, no matter how small or big they are. And they will affect people around us, positively or negatively. But what kind of decision can you make when your life is not what you expected or when you lose your way and become somebody completely unhappy? Will you risk everything including your family's happiness in order to achieve your own? Or can you be able to live a lie and leave behind your dreams and hopes to satisfy others? In 1998, a writer named Michael Cunningham wrote The Hours, a novel that tries to answer some of the answers previously made through the perspective of 3 different women: famous writer Virginia Woolf in the process of writing one of her most famous works: Mrs. Dalloway; Laura Brown, a depressed woman in post-war Los Angeles in the 1950's and Clarissa Vaughan, an editor from New York in present time, who's planning a party for her friend Richard, who's dying because of AIDS. Cunningham shows how these 3 women, with no apparent relation must decide what to do with their lives in one day. Woolf's mental instability is damaging her relationship with Leonard, her husband. Laura is married to a man who doesn't love and she's expecting her second child and Clarissa is living with Sally her lover, but she practically lives for Richard.The novel became an instant hit and even won the Pullitzer prize. With this background, the movie adaptation was a matter of time. That's how Stephen Daldry, director of the acclaimed independent movie Billy Elliot along with screenwriter David Hare bring to the big screen this story about living in order to find peace, which was a big challenge considering the novel is so rich in elements that many people actually considered impossible to integrate in a movie due to its complex psychological and introspective charge. Fortunately both, Daldry and Hare accomplish to avoid sentimentalism and melodrama to create a very haunting meditation of life and death.The biggest achievement of the movie, nevertheless, lies in the acting: all the cast members give superb performances and the 3 leading women are simply sublime: Meryl Streep as Clarissa, the confused woman who refuses to leave behind the man who she loved once. The always marvelous Julianne Moore as Laura, the desperate woman looking for herself before it's too late and Nicole Kidman in her Oscar-winning performance as the unstable Woolf. They give their characters a very melancholic depth that's quite rare to find in movies nowadays. The supporting cast is also remarkable: from Ed Harris as Richard, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, John C. Reilly, Allison Janney and Jack Rovello as Richie, Laura's son.Many people might claim this movie is the very essence of a depressing movie, but that's not the point of it:if this movie tries to tells us something it's a simple thing: don't be afraid of living your life as long as you're happy with it and don't hurt other people in the way of finding your happiness.",The Hours
185,Irish-Sunglasses,Like having nails pounded into your head,1,2 July 2003,"(SPOILERS)According to this movie, it is the males in the women's lives that make them miserable. I'm sure women who watch this movie will empathize completely with the female characters, but will not see them for what they are: completely selfish and having no regard for the effects they have on other people's lives.When Woolf tries to flee to London her poor husband has to remind her of all the sacrifices he's made just to keep her sane. This is what love is, but Woolf barely acknowledges this because she is apparently a lesbian who wishes she had never married this awful man anyway. Yes, Virginia Woolf did have mental issues so I guess she can be forgiven to an extent. But not the other women in this movie!Moore's character seems to be miserable for no reason...except that she's also a lesbian who wishes she had never married her ""awful"" husband. She is so hopeless she can't even bake a cake correctly, and then shows her true colors by abandoning her children to live a consequence-free gay lifestyle in Canada...with absolutely no regard for the effect it will have on her children (and husband) left behind. Considering what eventually happens to her son Richard, this makes her a despicable human being.Obviously Steep's character is supposed to be Mrs. Dalloway, but it is still baffling why she bursts into tears while trying to cook. Who knew cooking was such a strain? I guess it is because she is also a lesbian who has been caused so much grief by the vastly eccentric Richard.Moral of the story: never mind your own personal shortcomings!

It's basically an infinite recursion of intertextual frame narratives that center on the novel Mrs. Dalloway, which I had not read, but am currently reading...because of this movie.The screenplay is tight, hyper-aware of what it is doing and does so without feeling cumbersome much of the time. There is a particularly perfect spot where Meryl Streep's character discusses 'prescience', which is really the theme of the whole movie, and maybe even of Mrs. Dalloway...more to come on that.Bonus points: Nicole Kidman is unrecognizable, and really ceases to be herself while assuming Virginia Woolf, Phil Glass NAILS it on a score that ebbs and flows with the film's surrendering subjects and there's even a gorgeous scene where a hotel room quickly becomes what may or may not be Julianne Moore's final self-inflicted watery grave.",The Hours
188,Bgb217,Divine.,10,1 February 2003,"I saw ""The Hours"" almost two weeks ago, and now I am glad I finally have time to write about it. Fantastic film. Funny how some small brained critics for some rather large publications were scared by it. That aside, before I saw the film I thought I was going to be disappointed; I'd heard it was all about suicide, and from that I thought I had guessed the ending. Boy was I wrong, and boy was I glad; the film is not about suicide being the only way out sometimes-- ""The Hours"" is about life, as it should be lived. Brilliantly written, told, acted, and therefore done, ""The Hours"" is a true masterpiece.When I left the show after seeing this, the first thing that occurred to me was how great each and every actor in this movie was; Nicole Kidman WAS for the two hours I watched the film Virginia Woolfe, Meryl Streep WAS a woman named Clarissa living in New York in the year 2000, Julianne Moore WAS 1950's depressed housewife Laura Brown, and even Ed Harris WAS his character of a dying writer. I have to admit, I was a bit concerned with Kidman's fake nose, but that did not cheapen her performance or the movie in any way; it added to its greatness. The way she walked, the way she talked, the way she was-- was all so brilliant; Nicole Kidman is simply amazing. And Meryl Streep, her scenes of the emotions her character goes through are so genuine that they are simply brilliant. And then you have Julianne Moore who was nothing less than perfect as a depressed housewife. And then you get to Ed Harris, who plays a character with such emotional scenes that are so intense; some of the speeches he gives about writing and life-- I think I have rarely identified with a character in a movie such as I did to him with those words. And aside from his speeches, he not only looks the part, he acts them out in a perfect way that's simply brilliant. Give the whole damn cast an award, IMO.But, without the writing, of course, there would be no ""Hours"". The adapted script and the way that it is shot is nothing less than brilliant; the idea behind it, a story of three women living in different times but reading the same book, still amazes me in a perfect way. And the three stories are told so seamlessly; it's simply an experience you have to see for yourself.I would end the review here, had I not have to mention the aspect of sexuality that has been brought up in reviews I've seen: such reviews dubbed this as one about three lesbian women. And to that I say: say wha? I see one character who's sexuality is clearly defined, one character who tries something to see how her life would be if it were differently and is disappointed, and one woman who is clearly not a lesbian (I saw the kiss she gave to a woman as a way of saying good bye). But that said, I'm sure others may interpret the film differently. Also, in no way do I see this film as saying homosexuality equals madness; of course, believe me, it can lead to depression, though a kind that is not the clinical kind, one that is brought on by society in general giving you the message you're wrong just about every day, but I do not, in any way, see this film as against homosexuality.
In conclusion, ""The Hours"" is a purely brilliant film that's not to be missed. While it may be too much for some people, I still give this a high recommendation; the writing, performances, and overall execution are divine in this movie that stands among the most deep and moving ever made. Brilliant. Four out of four stars.",The Hours
189,Good-Evening-Clarice,"Two Amazing ""Hours""",10,19 January 2003,"For two hours you will be mesmerized by a poignant film that explores complex issues of identity, sorrow, grief, happiness and humanity and makes for a triumphant acting showcase. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep are three different women living in different periods who are all grappling with feelings of anguish because they have been placed in lives that they are disenchanted with. The movie takes place in one day during which our heroines decide to do something about their predicament. Some of their decisions are not wise, but they feel as though they must do something, anything, since they can no longer face the hours. All the performances are incandescent, but Nicole Kidman deserves special mention. Coming off terrific turns in ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""The Others,"" she is simply heartbreaking here. She makes her Virginia Woolf so striking and elegant while at the same time getting at the core of her emotional torment. The controversial prosthetic nose she dons looks very convincing, but what truly impressed me was the change in her voice--so deep, grave and foggy that it tells you everything about Woolf while adding an air of mystique that is playful and seductive at the same time. All in all, kudos to all involved. THE BEST FILM OF 2002!",The Hours
190,Good-Evening-Clarice,Nicole Kidman is officially the most versatile actress of her generation!,10,14 February 2003,"Forget the much-discussed prosthetic nose she dons to play the part of Virginia Woolf. Nicole Kidman's bravura performance in the masterful new drama THE HOURS transcends tangible transformation. The striking, leggy and elegant poise we have come to expect from the actress is not only lost in a completely new gait but her voice is absolutely unrecognizable as well. It is shrouded in a thick, foggy British accent. She really utilizes everything in her power to manifest the inner anguish and torment that Woolf suffers. Watch this film for Nicole's transformation if for nothing else; she has clearly transformed ever since her divorce--into the best, less predictable actress of her generation!",The Hours

It takes its time and presents us with real characters. In fact, the plot is minimal and allows the actors to really work with their characters. As a result, you get stupendous performances across the board. However, Nicole Kidman, in an Oscar-winning turn that is both subtle and ferocious, is the standout. No, it is not just about the nose, but about her change in speech, accent, posture, mannerism.

Everyone in the movie is gay, except for John Rielly's character, who is in the movie for no more than five minutes and whose sexuality is unknown, since some of the other gay people were married. In the film, two lesbeons had sex, which doesn't even seem possible.  It didn't even explain how it was done.  I don't even think bisexual people will enjoy this film.  They'd have to be at least 99.997% homosexual, because that's how gay this movie is.  Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay!",The Hours
193,PeterJordan,Thought provoking and fairly intense,6,9 August 2006,"The Hours is probably best classified as a serious, somewhat highbrow and intellectual film, partly biography of the writer Virginia Woolf, focusing on a period of her life and the turmoil she endured in writing her book Mrs Dalloway, but also cleverly intertwining this with the impact the story has on the lives of two other women in different times.Woolf herself is played brilliantly and darkly by an almost unrecognisable Nicole Kidman, appearing dowdy unkempt and frail as befits a brilliant author on the edge of a nervous breakdown or worse.The movie actually begins with Woolf's suicide in the Thames in 1943 but then backtracks to her wrestling with the writing of Mrs Dalloway in Richmond in 1921. Enter Julianne Moore playing a pregnant housewife in 1950s LA with a devoted husband and an intensely sad young son who anxiously observes his mother's own mental unravelling as she reads Mrs Dalloway. Meryl Streep plays a contemporary editor organising a party for her friend, ex lover and award wining poet Richard (a wonderful Ed Harris) who is terminally ill in the later stages of AIDs.The story follows all three in their outwardly pleasant and successful lives, but it is the delving deeper into the pain and despair that plague all three that is the real focus of the film. The jumping back and over in time periods is a bit disconcerting initially and makes the movie a bit hard to follow and even lacking in continuity. However as it progresses the threads all start being drawn together and we are gradually introduced to the connections between the three women.If one has the patience to persevere and not get irritated by the sometime delicate pace of the film, it is in the end a truly emotive and revealing experience with some brilliant insights on life and death and human relationships thrown in.If you like thought provoking, fairly intense and artistically crafted films with some great performances you'll probably like this one but if you're looking for thrills spills and a fast pace avoid it.",The Hours

I have seen ""Chick Flicks"" I didn't like but I knew were good (Thelma and Louise). Given this, I feel I can say safely ""Hours"" was just a bad movie. Someone decided that throwing three self absorbed,depressed women together - years apart - who had read Virginia Woolf, giving them meaning lives and a sever lack of wisdom would make a good movie.  Wrong!  The words boring and tedious do not do this movie justice.  Nicole Kidman may have deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her role in ""Moulin Rouge!"" in 2002, I don't know. But to give her the Oscar for this one note role of Virginia Woolf was a joke. Also, the background music was a bad as the rest of the movie.

The focus shifts between several different stories at various points in time.  Events are connected to one another by association rather than simple coming one after another.This film is truly excellent.  The cast is great; they must have taken pay cuts to appear in this film, otherwise it would have cost close to $100 million.

199,guy_lazarus,Gay Soap Opera The Most Over-rated Film of 2002,4,23 February 2003,"I found ""The Hours"" to be mediocre and at times laugh-aloud bad. Surely, this pretentious soap-opera  ranks as the most over-rated film of 2002.My first laugh out-loud incident (shared by most of the audience), was in the scene where Julianne Moore's character busses the character played by the wildly overacting Toni Collette. It literally brought down the house, it was so out-of-leftfield, so campy-corny. While the audience eventually simmered down, I could not contain myself during other inadvertently campy scenes. (Incidentally, I loved ""Far From Heaven."") Jeff Daniels' fey characterization was both horrible and a hoot as Ed Harris' other ex-lover. Didn't this crap go out with ""The Boys in the Band""? I can't help thinking: ""The Hours"" might have been hot stuff back in 1970, but in 2003? GIMME A BREAK!I won't go into this cinematic disappointment very deeply -- it's not worth it -- but let me say, Julianne Moore and Ed Harris were both wonderful (big surprise, eh?). What was a big surprise was the flat performance by Meryl Streep (coming so soon after I had enjoyed her thoroughly in ""Adaptation""), although that could be the character she played. Another pleasant surprise was the intense performance by Nicole Kidman, her best since ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  Although Nicole is NOT one of my favorite actresses by far, I can't imagine anyone else doing the role as well (including Streep or my favorite, Cate Blanchett; well, at least Cate wouldn't have needed the putty nose!). Miranda Richardson, always ignored in the write-ups of this film, also is quite good, though her role is too short (as is the Virginia Woolf sequence; I think the film would have been far better if it focused more on Woolf).Another irritation is that reviewers and critics almost unanimously fail to point out is about lesbians and gays; I honestly don't know what to think about that.... Is the fact that Virginia Woolf is in the picture serve as a ""brand"" that this is gay-themed? and please -- this isn't homophobia -- Fassbinder is my favorite post-war director -- I'm just not sure why this isn't highlighted; surely, Laura's ""problem"" isn't so much being married to an ugly slob like John C.

203,lhseaglerunner,"Eternal ""Hours""",7,5 March 2003,"It may sound hypocritical, but movie critics are more often than not, `full of sound and fury, signifying nothing' in that they build up films for their artsy qualities and too little for the sheer entertainment value that is what can really make a movie great. `The Hours,' in my not-so-humble opinion, is one of those films. I'll show you why.	The entire crux of the story is along the lines of `Mrs. Dalloway', a novel written by Virginia Woolf (portrayed here by Nicole Kidman) that focuses on a woman planning a party to disguise her own shortcomings. With that in mind, let us jump feet first into the plot.	The first plot line centers on Virginia Woolf who has been confined in a rest home by her semi-caring husband, Leonard (Stephen Dillane) due to her mental demons. While confined, she sets to work at what will prove to be her most everlasting work, `Mrs. Dalloway'.	The second plot line is set in 1950s suburbia in the United States, where Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife who is finding life as a homemaker to be extremely overwhelming, as she simultaneously attempts to bake a birthday cake for her husband (John C. Reilly) and entertain Richard, her clingy son (Jack Rovello).	The third thread is set in modern day New York where editor Clarissa Bell (Meryl Streep) attempts to throw a party in celebration of her dying former lover (Ed Harris) attaining a top poetry award. She, however, feels as though all of her shortcomings have been overexposed by his constant harping and has reached the end of her rope.	To start with, the plot can be summed up in two words-depressingly innovative. Why depressing? Well, a film where two major characters commit suicide can certainly not be called uplifting. As for the innovation, this film echoes `Adaptation' in the fact that there are three separate, yet interconnected plot lines. `The Hours' also goes one better than `Adaptation' by segue-ing between scenes with a character copying the previous character's action.	As for the acting, it was extremely well done. The audience can see that these are full and complete people and not merely figures upon a screen. I especially liked Streep's performance, but truth be told, there was not a poor performance in a bunch.	But if `The Hours' has all this going for it, then why did I not really like it? I offer a couple reasons. Firstly, it employed a repetition of objects in every scene that was frightfully reminiscent of the books I read for AP Lit (movies are for pleasure and not to remind one of work). Also there was that previously mentioned bit about it being a dark film-I went in with a good mood and I left feeling a bit down. A third reason is that it is far from a quick film-it is deliberate in pacing and in turn, seems to take `Hours' to finish. Finally, this is not a male-directed movie and just did not meet my tastes all that much.	In a rare move, I have opted to reward each half of the film-the art side (a.k.a. shameless pandering to the Oscars) which is really what the film aimed at, and the entertainment side. For art, I award a solid 9 but when it comes to entertainment value, I shall give 5 out of 10.",The Hours

Not much plot, very little meaningful dialog - it just seems to be a collection of some not-very-happy or downright miserable characters wallowing in self-pity...

She then wipes her nose and starts preparing dinner again!! She had previously been separating eggs by hand (rather than by moving the yolk from one shell to the other) and had still not wiped her hands. Not surprising, since the kitchen seemed to have no kitchen towels - just a pair of rubber gloves (not usually worn when cooking). The whole thing seemed most unhygienic.

Sadly my excitement was short lived. This is a tedious movie whose plot wanders pointlessly through an incomprehensible trilogy of tales, each one as baffling as the last. Nicole Kidman as eccentric English novelist Virginia Woolfe is believable enough but there is no real sense of her character ever developing.Her novel, ""Mrs. Daloway"", provides the inspiration for Streep and Julianne Moore's characters to embark on voyages of self discovery. These voyages however, only lead the characters back to the inertia Woolf herself seems to have suffered from.Ed Harris turns in a decent performance as a tortured poet dying of AIDS and the period scenes depicting Woolfe are well reconstructed.It is very hard though to see what message the movie is attempting to deliver.",The Hours

208,Don Stephens,"""Pompous, Pretentious""",3,31 January 2003,"Peter Jackson, director of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, is on record as saying ""What I don't like are pompous, pretentious films.""  I can relate. ""The Hours is like the corpse of a beauty queen.  Sure it's pretty, but it's not good for much of anything.  Much like ""Frida,"" it fails, all the while shrieking of its own importance.  ""This movie is about an obscure Mexican painter!  This movie has Virginia Woolf in it!  Come on, guys, this MEANS something!""This picture has been seen as a meditation on suicide and the psychological scarring of having lesbian urges in a repressive environment.  This is some pretty tall talk from Michael Cunningham, (author of the Pulitzer Prize winning novel) David Hare, (screenwriter and playwright) and Stephen Daldry. (director of this and the atrocious ""Billy Elliot."")  Did you catch that? All of the people behind the crative process of this movie are men.  I fancy myself a pragmatist and I don't see guards of aesthetic and moral truth. I see three guys trying desperately to get laid.At least that's what I think it's about.  There is no clear thread bringing Nicole Kidman's Virginia Woolf, Julianne Moore's depressed housewife, and Meryl Streep's real life ""Mrs. Dalloway"" together except the transparent ones cited in the paragraph above.  This must be one of those films where the viewer makes up their own mind as to what it all means.  I can't say this without invoking the mother of all Do-It-Yourself pictures: ""Mulholland Drive.""  At least ""Mulholland Drive"" gave you an incentive to figure it all out in trying to bring all of those seductive images together.  What does ""The Hours"" promise?  Why these sullen people were worth making a movie about, of course.  Yippee-Damn-Skippee!One can tell immediately that screenwriter David Hare is a playwright, because the screenplay to ""The Hours"" is laden with two minute long monologues where the characters spout meaningless words, baring their souls and weeping.  What actor wouldn't want to be a part of that?  So this degree of separation is apparent on screen of the character in psychological turmoil, and the actor making love to their ego while dreaming of Oscar. Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf is the only person on screen that successfully unifies herself with her character, as where anyone else just succeeds in the kind of teary-eyed mugging that even Community College actors wouldn't get away with.  This just proves why film is a better medium than theater.  Film belongs to directors, who serve the story, while theater belongs to actors, who serve only themselves.Which brings me back to Peter Jackson's quote.  I'm sure a lot of people hold this same opinion, but he was really the only one I've heard who just came out and said it.  I personally am of the belief that style is infinitely more important than substance.  Don't believe me?  Which was better, ""Pearl Harbor,"" or ""Eight Legged Freaks?""

Reilly, Ed Harris, Miranda Richardson, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Eileen Atkins, Toni Collette, and Claire Danes.  Even with this cast, though, I couldn't get myself to give this film a 10.  For some reason, I felt unattached to the Nicole Kidman - Stephen Dillane segment.Not surprisingly, I was most affected by the Meryl Streep - Ed Harris segment.  I thought that their unrequited love, which is brought to both characters attention constantly, was genuinely constructed by all the characters involved.  It shows how this unrequited love affects not only Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris, but also Ms. Janney and Mr. Daniels.  Everyone in the segment knows that Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris should have been together, and that in most intimate ways, they are.The segment that I found myself most drawn to was the Julianne Moore - John C. Reilly segment.  Watching Ms. Moore hide her true feelings from her son and Mr. Reilly was heartwrenching.  And while Mr. Reilly has the face of a true character actor, I am constantly amazed at the emotions that come across on Ms. Moore's face.  She has a face as smooth and beautiful as a Michaelangelo statue ... a porcelain skin too beautiful for words.  And yet she manages to use this face as an awesome tool in her considerble acting resource ""closet"".  This becomes very clear as her face is hidden beneath latex in later scenes.  Underneath the latex, she becomes less interesting and lucky for us director Stephen Daldry notices this as well and keeps that scene as short as possible. Unfortunately Ms. Kidman does not fare as well.  Her performance - and that of Stephen Dillane - is great, no doubts about it.  But for some reason I was strangely uninvolved in her segment.  I found the other two to be so much less conventional that this segment, even anchored by the great work of Mr. Dillane and Ms. Kidman, seemed somewhat pedestrian.  I venture to guess that this segment was the easiest to write and direct.In the end, I thought it was cool the way Harold Pinter and Stephen Daldry tied it all together.  Thematically it was tied together all the way through, but they really tie it up well.  Perhaps the greatest comment I can give the movie is to say that I am curious to read MRS. DALLOWAY now.  That, and that the film would make a great double feature with Ms. Moore's FAR FROM HEAVEN.",The Hours
211,pf9,Intelligent movie which finds relations between deep questions,7,11 January 2003,"This movie is not driven by chase scenes, by actors smashing furniture or by cutesy stylistic frills. No, this movie is driven by ideas, it has something to say, and attempts to say it with great urgency. The three ideas at its center are--- in the face of adversity what should determine the choice of life or death?--- what is happiness?--- how do the answers to the preceding two questions migrate from life to art and back?These are supremely important questions and it is this movie's merit that it tries to come to terms with them. Does it? To a certain extent it does, but not altogether to the point of true illumination on any one of these questions. The dice are loaded. Both `successful' suicides (the Nicole Kidman and Ed Harris characters) are afflicted by severe incurable illnesses, so you'd say the choice for them is much easier and much more justified than it is for the third --- everything comes in threes in this movie --- `unsuccessful' suicide attempt (that of the Julianne Moore character). Yet by being made easier, the choice also looses some of its existential grandeur. On the other hand, both successful suicides, by their own admission, have known happiness and have nothing but agony to look forward to in their lives, whereas the Julianne Moore character has not known happiness. So we may not learn as much as we wish about life and death decisions or about what happiness is, but we do get to see the deep interrelation of these two questions. The movie's strength resides in the relative, not in the absolute. Life/death and happiness these are daunting absolutes, but their interdependence, by definition relative, is more accessible and defines the very structure of this movie: three stories simultaneously emphasizing the universality of the problems explored and their relative interdependence. Kidman plays the great novelist Virginia Woolf whose life and art both revolve around these questions. Ed Harris plays a poet only too familiar with `Mrs. Dalloway' Woolf's breakthrough novel, whereas much earlier his mother (Julianne Moore) reads that novel at the very time when her own unhappiness seems to drive her to suicide. In each case the issue of duty to the living, the ones left over, arises and is artistically distilled by Woolf into the beautiful sentence ""Someone has to die that the rest of us should value life more."" This insight directly connects life, death, valuing life, as good a definition of happiness as any, and ultimately by generalizing to `the rest of us,' translates it all into the timeless, the universal, the artistic.It is also interesting how many other parallels are established between the three stories, the sexual ambivalence, the cooking, This movie could have easily transgressed into the didactic, yet with David Hare's superb screenplay we see full-blooded human characters act out their individual stories so that the bigger truths emerge naturally, but only upon further thought. Not even the slightest attempt is made at spoon-feeding them to the audience. The acting is awe-inspiring. Not only the principals, but even the small roles, for instance Kitty played so memorably by Toni Collette. The only weaker point is Meryl Streep's performance, which, while doing justice to the excitability, chronic depression and emotional exhaustion of the Clarissa Vaughan character, is built out of Ms. Streep's by now familiar mannerisms. One cannot help recognizing other past Streep characters in Clarissa's various crises and this interferes with one's --- in any case with my --- ability to take Clarissa seriously.All in all this is an intelligent and intriguing movie, which while not breaking new cinematic ground, asks deep questions and discovers remarkable relations between them.",The Hours
212,Jen_UK,Hypnotic,10,21 February 2003,"I must admit to being genuinely baffled by some of the negative criticism this magnificent film has received since its release. Film goers lament endlessly the lack of thought provoking intelligence, quality acting and indeed scarcity of gripping roles for women in Hollywood, but when a film comes along that offers all three qualities in abundance, all they seem to do is pick holes in it! For what it's worth I believe 'The Hours' to be a landmark film, a beautifully created masterpiece, and a crucial work for women to see - both as spectators, and for future actresses in terms of the opportunities its success will (hopefully) open up. Aesthetically, 'The Hours' is endlessly beautiful. It's apt that the film opens with a river, because its beauty simply washes over you as the story unfolds. Each moment is lovingly agonised over by Stephen Daldry, whose attention to detail is second to none. The result is an absolute visual feast of stunning imagery - flowers, water, and nature. I adored the evocative manner in which the three different settings [contemporary New York, 1940s Los Angeles and Richmond] were signalled in the lighting, and this was aided immeasurably by simply glorious costuming and make-up. David Hare has transformed Michael Cunningham's wonderful homage to Virginia Woolf into a mesmerising screenplay - literate, moving, profound and riveting. I love the effortless way his words move you, and engage your brain at the same time. This is rare in today's cinema. Perhaps, however, the single most remarkable facet of 'The Hours' is (for me) the acting. The cast - one that I would have dreamed about before hearing of this film - could not be bettered. Each of the three primary actresses, Streep, Moore and Kidman, is impeccable in their own way and I suspect individual disposition will dictate whose story moves you the most. I only hope their resounding achievment here will be rewarded by a plethora of intelligent scripts for women in the future. Much praise has been lauded onto Nicole Kidman, and let me say that her achievments go far beyond make-up, dowdy dresses and the prosthetic nose that critics have become so obsessed with. Her piercing blue eyes (said to have the ability to scorch holes in carpet by one critic) succeed in capturing the essence of Woolf's fractured emotion, and the depth of her performance is truly outstanding. She is also intensely moving and at times painful to watch. Julianne Moore - a remarkably versatile actress - is magnificent as Laura Brown, the introspective, lonely housewife. She has an amazingly expressive face and haunting eyes, making dialogue hardly necessary in conveying her deep unhapiness, a performance almost suited to silent cinema. Again, her story was at times intensely painful.
 And finally to Meryl Streep who is, for me, the finest of the three (although this is an ensemble performance - the three should all be rewarded for their acting together) I found her energetic, elegant, graceful and powerful. She invested Clarissa which such an enthusiasm for life and an energy - plus a subdued longing - and I found her performance explosive. Take note small minded producers - we need more Meryl on the screen. Her humanity and charisma is boundless. Give me her over 1000 twenty-something non entities any day.  Special mentions also to Stephen Dillane (magnificent and underrated as Leonard Woolf) Toni Collette (her kiss with Julianne Moore is possibly the tenderest moment in the film) Miranda Richardson (always excellent) and Ed Harris (a great, moving performance from him) All of these actors and others help to allow this film to live in the minds of those who see it and are moved by it for long after the credits roll. I want to end by applauding all involved in the creation of an exquisite, lyrical masterpiece. I found it at times heartbreaking, yet strangely enriching and even life affirming, despite its potentially morose themes of suicide and depression. It left me with the desire to find out more about Virginia Woolf, and to look at my own life in a different way. Surely this has to speak volumes for the overriding success of this wonderful film. Awards shouldn't matter, but I hope it sweeps the board at this year's Oscars. It deserves its success and as a humble film-goer, I will be eternally thankful for its existence.",The Hours

214,mezaco,Beautiful...but NOT for everyone,9,18 February 2003,"This is definately a polarizing film, with the Oscar nominations clearly clashing with the comments here about people walking out, people hating it, etc.I could not help but be moved by this film. It's very difficult to pin down, I could not give a ""plot summary"" even if I was paid to. But the sadness, the yearning inside these women is hypnotic. Sometimes the film, does wallow a bit deep, like the scene with Meryl Streep and Claire Danes talking on the bed. But this is a film that takes subjects like depression, sadness, what it means to live and what it means to die and examines them, thinks about them, probes them.The acting by the three main stars, not the mention the impressive list of supporting characters (especially the magnificent Ed Harris) is stunning. Seeing three actresses show their craft, their devotion to their art, is a real gift. The beautiful soundtrack adds a haunting and moving backdrop as well.In today's film world, where Spiderman and Daredevil are the box office favorites, is there any room for a sad film about depression and death? Maybe, maybe not. But I'm glad to see a daring film that leaves you thinking long after. It leaves you thinking about the characters, their thoughts, their behaviour.But if you don't think you COULD enjoy this film, stay home. I have no patience for people who expected ""The Hours"" to be other than what it was. If you need your movie plots to be banged over your head with a hammer, please stay away. This movie deserves better.",The Hours

There is also a gay poet who has some inner demons to kill. And takes on a short fight with gravity.It's fair to say I enjoyed the film. But one can bear only so much misery.

216,RockBiter,For A Select Audience,7,9 June 2009,"This is perhaps my all-time fave film for watching at night by myself - a 'me' film. There have been some other posters that have made similar statements. It is first and foremost a story for people who live 'in here' (as I'm tapping my temple). Do I mean introverts? Yeah, I guess I do. In other words, it is not just a story for people living with mental illness or clinical depression or who have such people in their families. Anyone can take a lot away from this film but MOSTLY introverts, I think.I am an introvert. I also like to write and aspire to be published one day. When Virginia's sister tells her children that their aunt lives two lives she is making a more accurate statement than she perhaps realizes for Virginia lived 'in there' as well as in the world. When the sister is leaving, Virginia asks her: 'Do you think one day that I will escape?' (from living 'in there'). I had tears in my eyes because I could understand so clearly what she was going through. But Virginia KNEW that she would never really escape from living 'in there'. The scene at the railway station where Leonard pours out his soul, it is perhaps my favourite in the whole film....he is always reaching out to Virginia, the woman whom he loves, but she can never quite reach back to him. And both of them know it. This is why she rationalized her death as being her way to release him from her own prison within her mind.This was not really a critique of the film itself, only a psychological insight to its message, one which happened to touch me greatly.",The Hours

218,hosolo,Art film,7,25 August 2006,"I've been on a Kidman kick lately, meaning after watching how brilliant she was in ""The Others"", I wanted to ""discover"" more of her work. Here Kidman plays or rather IS British author Virginia Woolf. Woolf (an unrecognizable Kidman)is seen writing Mrs. Dalloway, while Julianne Moore playing a post-World War II housewife, is reading it. Fast forward to the 21st century, and the most respected of all actresses, Meryl Streep as Clarissa Vaughn, is actually a living Mrs. Dalloway. They are three women in an unenviable situation. On the surface they are leading normal lives. Inside their souls are being crushed.Watching ""The Hours"" could be depressing at times. Ed Harris, as the poet Richard is dying of AIDS, Woolf is a mentally disturbed writer, Moore's character Laura Brown decides to abandon her children and all of this is happening while a party is being given. ""The Hours"" though, is a remarkably well told story through three different time periods. Each lead character's segment (Woolf, Laura Brown, and Clarissa Vaughn) seamlessly relate to one another.This is a film only a true adult can understand and appreciate. It is not for impatient audiences, but I have to say, I was a little bit shocked to see all three lead actresses share a kiss with three other fine actresses (Toni Colette, Miranda Richardson, Allison Janney), but hey this is an ""art film"", with a great ensemble cast. What was the big deal then of ""Brokeback Mountain"", when this was 3 years before.Even with the heavy mood of this film, it carries on because of such terrific performance from Oscar winners Kidman, Streep and Moore, eventually. I haven't seen Miranda Richardson in a movie in a while, so it was a great surprise to see she was in this film along with Toni Colette, Ed Harris, Jeff Daniels, Stephen Dillane, and John C. Reilly from Chicago. I can't honestly say I was impressed with the child actor who played Mrs. Brown son, but he does grow up to be the impressive Ed Harris, in the film anyway. Recommended for drama lovers.",The Hours
219,jwills-5,Good Virgina's Woolf Adaptation,7,4 March 2013,"It's a film that creates a profound impact, for the excellent performance of the three female characters but especially because of the subjects treated, all associated with the great work of Virginia Woolf, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" written in 1923, and that greatly influenced twentieth-century literature with their concepts of modernism and the idea that any situation, including the inner thoughts of a person are worthy of a novel. The dilemma of suicide, clashes between the inner thoughts and the people around us, to live life for one or the other, lesbianism, are some of the main arguments that leave a deep feeling. It is recommended to read Woolf's work prior to watch the film, to understand even better the challenges and smart partnerships developed by writer and director in three women with their families and friends, who live three different periods of the twentieth century, but which have as a common denominator, ideas, thoughts and anxieties of Mrs. Dalloway.

223,anicerman,Get something different,9,14 November 2006,"This should be the first time I like a film of this kind and tried to persuade others to watch together.I would not say this film is enjoyable as there's no much sadness inside. The film covers a lot of different topics: love, life, freedom, homosexuality, morality, etc. The three main characters are no common at all, but I really see very different points of view towards the topics. The three women are all in difficult times and are ruled by pessimism. The way they think and act may be too extreme and strange, but people like them really exist and we may also face the contradictions they face. I'm sure you'll get more from the film.The actresses are all well-chosen. Julianne Moore acts so well that you can really feel how lost she is. Nicole Kidman's performance is impressive and is a breakthrough of her career, though I don't think this role would have probably got her an Oscar (most of the Oscars are quite unexpected anyway). You don't even need a word for Meryl Streep. It seems to me you could play any roles well without effort.You can treat the film as three individual stories or as a whole telling of ""The Hours"".

226,darrell-garrison,Woman power?,7,3 February 2003,"(7 out of 10)  Sorry, but if I were a woman, I'm sure I'd give this at least a 9.  This movie screams 'chick flick', and I did my best to relate, but I just can't like a woman can.'The Hours', as stated by Ed Harris' AIDS-ridden character, refers to the hours we face looking at life, and contemplating death.  The hours, days and years pass by; how will we live with them?  What choices do we make?  Do we attack life with gusto, or give up, and wait for death?Not being familiar with the book, I was confused at first with where 'The Hours' was going.  It finally clicked in after about 15 minutes.  The connection between three generations is Virgina Woolf and her novel, 'Mrs. Dalloway'.  So there really are four layers if you include the heroine of Woolf's book.  These layers are fascinating in their sameness and too, how they differ.  Meryl Streep holding onto life/death through Ed Harris; Julieanne Moore holding onto a so-called life as she fights the urge to accept death; Virgina Woolf holding onto life and sanity, with death seemingly a constant temptress.  I love Julianne Moore's acting, and her movie choices.  Here she plays a sliver of her 'Far From Heaven' character.  In 'Heaven' she was totally accepting of the role of 1950's stereotypical housewife.  In 'The Hours' this same role claws at her, suffocating her, driving her mad. 
Meryl Streep gives yet another strong performance, and is perfect in her role as modern woman facing mid-life crisis.  Good for Clair Danes getting to play her daughter; this will help her career!But the standout is, of course, Nicole Kidman.  Look at her early work side-by-side with Streep's.  Streep has ALWAYS been great.  It's taken Kidman many many years to become a true actress and to then be able to snag these juicy parts ('Moulin Rouge', 'The Others').  Her hard work has paid off with what is easily her best acting performance yet; that of the complicated, intelligent, morose and genius Virgina Woolf.I was completely blown away by Kidman's look.  The acting combined with the fantastic make-up made me believe.  Unfortunately, as stated above, I simply cannot feel some things the way a woman can.  Men (stereotyping here...sorry) see things in more black-and-white terms, just like the men in the film.  We see a problem, think about how to fix it, and plow ahead, confident in our cleverness.  All of these women are complex, moody and difficult to understand.  Which is why I was so surprised to find out it was written by a man!  He is certainly better in tune with both sexes than I am.Beautifully written and acted (Ed Harris is great).  Wonderful to see such great parts for great actresses.  Fascinating storyline (especially the feel of Woolf's world of 60-80 years ago).  Clever and difficult concept that really does work in the end (Julieanne Moore again!).  I won't see this film again anytime soon, though.  Once was enough.  Maybe I'M afraid of Virgina Woolf!",The Hours

229,sommerjd,Unfairly neglected,10,23 March 2003,"This is a marvelous film, certainly superior to the other Oscar nominees for best picture.  Great books rarely make great movies, but Michael Cunningham's brilliant novel and Stephen Daldry's brilliant movie prove the exceptions to that rule.  The literate script, the seamless weaving of three interlocking stories, the beautiful cinematography make this a special movie.However, its lasting greatness finally rests upon a miraculous ensemble of performers.  Yes, Nicole Kidman is wonderful as Virginia Woolf, and yes, Julianne Moore is her equal (and better than she was in ""Far From Heaven"") as a tragically unhappy American housewife.  But there are other gem-like performances to praise here as well:*Miranda Richardson shines in her brief moments on screen as Virginia's sister and Jeff Daniels is surprisingly tender in his small part.*British actor Stephen Dillane deserves at least 50% of Kidman's Oscar for his role as Leonard Woolf.  He captures the character's love, devotion, and pain in his remarkably expressive eyes and face.  He shines in a wonderful train depot scene with Kidman.*Ed Harris re-defines pain in his unforgettable performance as a dying poet. It is impossible to get Harris out of your mind after seeing this film despite his limited time onscreen.  A truly great role for a truly gifted actor.  The despair and agony of his character almost make it impossible to watch him, so convincing is he.*And there's Meryl Streep.  This is her movie.  Her character is the most important one in the film, and she carries the film with her.  She is so wonderful a performer that we have come to take her for granted.  I remain convinced that the greatest film performance ever given is Streep's as Sophie in ""Sophie's Choice,"" but she rivals that in ""The Hours.""  She is just beyond praise thoroughout this movie, but her kitchen scene with Jeff Daniels, her final scene with Julianne Moore, and most especially her two extended scenes with Ed Harris, are indelible.  The emotional wallop of Streep and Harris's work together left me literally shaking in my seat.This is a film I know that I will watch again and again and will treasure forever.  This year's winners will fade from memory long before I forget ""The Hours.""",The Hours
230,daddyofduke,An Incredible Film in Every Respect,9,1 February 2012,"Several years ago a dear, dear friend of mine committed suicide, very publicly and very violently. Those of us who loved her were, and are, of course, devastated by her death, and the manner in which it was conceived, might find some solace and insights for her actions by this outstanding movie. I did. The film, directed by Stephen Daldry, is a brilliant adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael CunninghamThe heart of The Hours is the novel by Virginia Woolfe, Mrs. Dalloway. In preparation for watching The Hours I began to read the novel. Doing so provided some backdrop to the film, but it is certainly not necessary to read the novel to appreciate the magnitude and the dimensions of this film's brilliance. There are touches of that novel that are obvious, like Meryl Streep character's first name of Clarissa, references to flowers, and, of course, death. Kidman's narrative, similar to the stream of consciousness that radiates within the novel, is a little less obvious, but no less effective.The soul of The Hours are great performances by great actors, including Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman (who deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Virginia Woolfe), Julianne Moore, Ed Harris, Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson, Jeff Daniels, John C. Reilly, and Stephen Dillane. Each one of their performances deserves acclaim after acclaim after acclaim.There is a simultaneity to the film that underscores its transcendence. The films actions focus on 1923, 1941, 1954 and 2001. What one character does in one decade is similar to what another character does in another decade. I suppose that the choice to include the year 2001 in the film's timeline is not incidental. The film opens with an accurate account of Virginia Woolfe's actual suicide, which involves walking into a river with rocks in her pocket. Narrated aloud is a haunting love letter to her husband explaining why. It begins with the words, ""I'm going mad again.""In addition to Virginia, the film's central characters include Clarissa Vaughn, an editor who once had a love relationship with Rich Brown, a poet dying of AIDS, played by Ed Harris,. Clarissa now lives with, and loves, Sally Lester, played by Allison Janney. Laura Brown, portrayed by Julianne Moore, is a troubled woman who lives the prototypical life of homemaker in the 1950s. Her husband, played by John C. Reilly, loves Laura, but Laura is conflicted about her feelings towards him, and towards her son. All of the characters I've just mentioned, and those that I haven't, as offered in The Hours, provide a tapestry into the conscience of emotional torment. Outlined in this film is the logical irrationality of suicide.I must also commend the film's dialog. At one point Ed Harris character states, ""No matter what you start with, it ends up being so much less."" Streep's Vaughn comments to her former lover, ""That is what we do. That is what people do. They stay alive for each other.""My favorite quote came from Virginia Woolfe in that final letter she wrote to her husband, ""To look life in the face, always, to look life in the face and to know it for what it is. At last to know it, to love it for what it is, and then, to put it away...""Can it be that suicide is sometimes, in some way, actually an affirmation of a life lived?",The Hours

Yes, the performances by Kidman, Harris, and Streep are very good, with Kidman's bordering on excellent and worthy of her Oscar. Sadly, the movie gives the impression that Virgina Woolfe's life isn't worth a full movie - that two other plots are needed to fill the entire tedious 114 min. While I understand what was trying to be said in the film, it was done in such a drawn-out, repetitive, overwrought fashion that I quickly stopped caring about anyone other than Kidman. Even the connections between the three plot lines are weak, at best. Eventually you start wondering if, despite them not even filming together, the three leads were all trying to out depress each other for the Oscar. And the motivations for their characters to feel this way are murky and difficult to ascertain. My recommendation is to watch the bits about Wolfe, fast forward through Moore looking like a depressed Stepford Wife, and also through the Streep subplot knowing she's a good actress but is being wasted on sup-par material, which unfortunately passes as ""great"" in today's Hollywood.",The Hours
232,richards1052,a glorious film--Ed Harris & Nicole Kidman are immense!,10,19 January 2003,"Would it be a contradiction in terms to say that a film essentially about depression could be a beautiful, elegant & eloquent work of art?  ""The Hours"" is one of the most intense works of art I've ever experienced.  A note of warning: whatever the greatnesses of this film (& they are many) there are many things this film is not: it is not happy, falsely optimistic, sentimental or anything that almost every other Hollywood film is.  It is brutal, it is cruel, it is, well goddamn depressing!  That's all there is to it.But if you do not see this film because it is hard or depressing, then you will be missing one of the great films of this yr. or any other.Ed Harris' performance as a poet dying of AIDS is harrowing to the Nth degree.  His dying, fiery blue eyes are penetrating.  They are frightening to behold.  His final speech to Meryl Streep's character is moving beyond words (if you can say that about something that is, in fact, made of words).Nicole Kidman rivets as Virginia Woolf in the darkest throes of her depressive illness.  The scenes she shares with her niece, Angelica Bell, are achingly sad & beautiful: in one they together bury a dead bird, after which Virginia lays her body down calmly next to the bird's as if to share its fate.  In Virginia's final scene in the film w. Angelica, the young girl sits in her lap & asks her what she was thinking.  Woolf replies that she was thinking of killing her heroine & then thought better of it.  But Woolf adds that she now must kill off someone else.  The blazing glance that she gives her niece after this statement is fearless, profound & frighteningly acute acting on Kidman's part.Everyone connected w. this film should be deeply proud of their accomplishment.  They have made something moving, powerful & deeply troubling.Another warning: if you suffer fr. depression or know anyone who has this film will be even more disturbing.  So be prepared for a tough, intense experience, but one more than worth having.Richard",The Hours

Maybe because she never says outright what her problem is, although it becomes clear (or at least in my mind) that she is simply unhappy of living a hum-drum existence.For a while I was expecting Moore's character to turn out to be having an affair; I was wrong.The boy playing her son was absolutely wonderful.

He wasn't wrong - it is impossible to fault at any level: Acting, dialogue, costumes, locations, soundtrack, scenery, settings or storyline.Films like this don't come along too often - beautifully made in an almost understated way, it relates to no major event or cataclysm, it chronicles no turning-point in history and it poses no worrying conundrum for the future. It is simply a quietly-told story that will criss-cross between various points in time and take you deep into the characters' emotions and portray the effect that they have on their lives. When you have seen and come to understand the events that take place, by the time it concludes it will leave you feeling refreshed and perhaps a little better in touch with the emotions in your own life - just like good films should, but sadly, so rarely do...Easily 9 out of 10 - If you watch this one, you will not regret the time spent.",The Hours

But it's only loving really our lives that can help us to hold on and take/give love and support from/to our people is the rule to remain sane and happy to live.

236,puckbond007,The Hours-7/10 is an interesting but depressing film...,7,14 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersThe Hours is an interesting but depressing film about life, death and suicide connected by the lives of 3 different women from different eras. Unfortunately the film really fails at what it is trying to say about these issues and is only worth seeing because of the performances of the 3 actresses. Nicole Kidman stars as acclaimed and troubled author Virginia Woolf, living in England in the early 1940's with her distant husband. Suffering from mental illness she longs for the big city and feels stifled and suffocated in the small town. She is writing a book called Mrs. Dalloway about an ineffectual woman contemplating suicide who is throwing a party. Julianne Moore is a suburban housewife living in 1950's Los Angeles with her young son and content husband played by John C. Reilly. She is reading Woolf's book ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and also preparing things for her husband's birthday. Meryl Streep plays Clarissa Vaughn, nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by a writer dying of AIDs played by Ed Harris(terrific in the two scenes he is in), who she is throwing a party for. she lives in modern day new York with her lover played by Allison Janney and has a daughter played by Claire Danes. The 3 women are all connected by ""Mrs. Dalloway""-Kidman is writing it, Moore is reading it and Streep is living it. All have feelings of unhappiness and contemplate suicide for different reasons as does Ed Harris' character. My problem with the film is that some of them have legitimate reasons and some don't. I think the film really fails at what it is trying to say about suicide. Naturally it should be that life is worth living, but to me it didn't really drive home that point enough. Apart from what the film is trying to accomplish the performances are great especially Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf unrecognizable but great as the tortured and miserable writer. Meryl Streep was also good too and Ed Harris as I mentioned earlier. The film is quite choppy switching from era to era, however I liked how they did it with the women doing and saying the same things or using different props and settings to move from one time line to another. There is a surprise revelation at the end of the film that felt forced and manufactured and I just didn't buy it. Overall, The Hours is an interesting film that conects life and death through the lives of 3 women and the writings of Virginia Wolf. It ddn't fully connect with me but it is worth seeing for the performances especially Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Ed Harris.",The Hours

In this movie these more serious illnesses are associated with more creative people, and lead to suicides, while depression does not, -which strikes as an oversimplified view. Moreover, acting-wise how much more unhappy and suicidal does J. Moore look, which is masochistically much more pleasurable as well! Also, I am not sure, but where is the art in this movie? You take any family and make a similar connection to some cultural icon and make a movie out it, in this movie its Virginia Wolf, why this specific author, because of some lesbian undertones, this still does not make the connection between heroines more special? I partially watched this movie because of the Oscar-buzz and performance by N. Kidman, and she is great actress, and at moments - I could forget that Wolf is Kidman, but overall; nevertheless, I thought she had had better roles and better performances (The Others), and it is questionable if she has a leading role in the movie...",The Hours
241,deeprise1988,Victimized ladies and forth,7,31 May 2012,The Hours has been told through the authors point of view Virgina Woolf taking inspiration for his novel from real life incidence story follows story of two more ladies. It talks about individual feelings for their life happiness and to pursuit that freedom. It remarks question of own happiness and life bounded by own's life. Actually what is happiness? Its a complicated question character played by Julianne Moore is unhappy with her life he has good husband(Yes he is good better than many married man) but she is depressing and unhappy. She leaves her family her young kid get devastated by her mother's step which reflects that trauma in his adolescences. Actually where is love may be its in our own life but we are not able to find it. Film has different aspects and it is told in mannerism its complicated but urge for happiness makes person unable to see unseen happiness around them. Acted well From Nicole to Julianne to Meryl but one eyes that I found scary though of little boy whose innocence get killed.,The Hours
242,jazzpiano-,Hours well spent,8,10 April 2007,"'The Hours' is a subtly philosophical film, in which the three core characters question their existence (in general, and also in relation to society's expectations) when faced by death and the passing of time, hence the title. All three characters are linked, not only by what they do as characters in the film, but by visual links conceived by the film's creators. The film is composed of three separately filmed, literal narratives, injected with symbolic imagery and metaphors.The three characters are closely linked with each other: Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is a modern-day Mrs. Dalloway, whose opening line is, ""Sally! I think I'll buy the flowers myself."", Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a suburban 50's housewife currently reading Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), who in the 1920's has only begun writing the novel itself.At first, I thought Nicole Kidman was a casting mistake. I've never seen Kidman give emotional depth or realism to a character, so I was definitely a skeptic. With a prosthetic nose, she is rendered unrecognizable in this film, which works in her favour as it makes her believable. The costume design and other visual aspects of the film are perfect - the film seems very loyal to the time.Julianne Moore gives a typically great performance, communicating a deep sorrow through body language, while she helps her son bake a cake. Later in the film, in one of the most moving scenes, Moore delivers a beautiful performance as she betrays what she is feeling to keep her husband happy, but I wouldn't want to spoil the scene for you.I haven't warmed to Meryl Streep as an actress. She certainly had an extraordinary reputation to live up to when I saw one of her movies for the first time. I'd read articles and biographies that named her the greatest living actress, so when I finally saw one of her films I was disappointed. It wasn't that she was bad, on the contrary, her performance was gorgeous, but not mindbogglingly amazing.This is the first film where I saw some of Streep's brilliance shine through. Streep only lives through one day as Clarissa Vaughn, but Clarissa sure does have an emotional day! I have a great respect for Streep now, because I've seen a couple of her films and the roles she chooses seem quite varied.I would like to note the appearance of Toni Collette in the first half of the film, as Kitty. Toni Collette embodied the character fleshed out in the book by Michael Cunningham so well, and she held a perfect balance between admitting her sadness and denying it altogether.The music! Philip Glass' score nearly overshadowed the brilliant acting! They worked so well together - the music tied the three stories together, and the rolling piano and sombre strings complemented the emotional scenes without becoming overly sentimental or sappy.The film, as a whole, is unsentimental and bleak, but still very emotionally affecting. The lack of sentiment, perhaps, makes the film seem cold and lonely, which is what all three characters are feeling. There are fleeting moments of pure love for our characters, which they receive gratefully, only to have it denied from them again. That's all I dare say about the film before I have to put a spoiler warning.All in all, a deeply thoughtful and faithful adaptation of Michael Cunningham's novel. In fact, the novel and the film complement each other nicely. The book is very insightful to the characters, and the film is beautifully structured, with judged performances and emotive music. Neither one is 'better' than the other, in my opinion.I believe that it wouldn't matter if you read the book before the film or vice versa, because both have the power to surprise and engage. I really loved the film, it's very re-watchable, which makes any film a great film; a film with longevity.",The Hours
243,jickweez,best of '02 - despite its derivative source,10,2 January 2003,"This is the first film I've seen where the entire cast steals the show. I haven't read Mrs. Dalloway (or any Woolf book for that matter), nor could I suffer through the novel The Hours (and have no desire to after seeing this immaculate movie). I did, however, read 'Was,' which was published years before The Hours and the first book to weave the past with the present and fact with fiction into a yarn based on a literary masterwork (Was tackled imaginary and real events surrounding the 'Wizard of Oz'). Despite The Hours' (the novel) blatant rip off of the signature 'Was' structure, the film transcends the deriviative nature with seamless editing and some of the best acting ever preserved on celluloid. Even the mouthy servant deserves recognition. The best movie of 2002.",The Hours
244,RoxanneAndorfer,"An amazingly intense, focussed film",10,2 June 2003,"Rarely have I seen a movie that is as emotionally intense and focussed as ""The Hours,"" since the era of Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, and Ingmar Bergman.Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely perfect, crystalline performance in the role of Virginia Woolf.  In this role, for the first time, she has succeeded in submerging her own off-screen personality into that of her character, a rare accomplishment for an actor who has become recognized as ""a star.""  She didn't even look like Nicole Kidman playing a role; she looked like ""the"" Virginia Woolf, though not quite as homely.  Julian Moore and Ed Harris are not far behind, either.This movie has been described by some other reviewers as ""too long and too boring.""  But the whole point of the movie is the portrayal of three lives in which the empty, oppressive monotony of time - ""The hours, Clarissa, the hours"" - gradually bears down upon and drives to extreme actions three of the characters: Virginia Woolf herself (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), and Richard Brown, her son, who is played as an adult dying of AIDS by Ed Harris and as a child by Jack Rovello.  This is in ironic contrast to Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), who is able to find escape from the existential angst by focussing her life on other people.This is not a movie for the faint of heart who are uncomfortable with intense emotion; nor for those who fly from self-examination; nor for those of limited intellect.  It is very much a film for adults.",The Hours
245,nekanderson881,Visit The Hours again,10,20 April 2004,"The layers of complexity of this excellent film are better understood upon a second viewing.  The past experiences of the characters are alluded to, and one has to listen carefully to understand the significance of these.  Woolf has her past, Clarrisa had her youthful summer love affair with Richard, and Laura Brown had her painfully shy high school years.  Each of these women's back stories informs us of their hours in the day that we are seeing unfold in this film.  Laura felt different than the other girls; thus her shyness and painful marriage where she was trying to be the perfect wife, all the while wanting something else.  Woolf suffered from mental illness and had no means of being treated in the 1920's.  The present day Mrs. Galloway's passion is for a Richard, a gay poet dying of AIDS.  His former lover visits and she breaks down from the weariness of seeing Richard ravished by the disease and the lover's presence bringing back so many memories. Streep's performance here is one of her very best.  To my mind she blows everybody else off the screen.  We see Clarrisa working in the kitchen separating the eggs; buying the flowers from the lady who has read Richard's poetry and novel; talking to her lover Sally from the next room; kissing her lover after hearing Laura's confession; her sweet, yet complex conversation with her daughter; negotiating with Richard as he resists her caring; and then again later in the day when she witnesses his outburst after mixing his meds which leads to tragedy.  John Reilly, Julianne Moore, Toni Collette, and the little boy who plays the son are all remarkable in the 1950's sequence.  There is real poetry in the scenes with Moore.The whole enterprise with Kidman's Woolf and her relationship with her husband and the cutting back and forth between the other two time periods are masterful.  I also appreciated Kidman's performance much more on the second viewing.  This film seems to me a major achievement of its kind - a real multi-layered meaningful story about the human condition.  The wonderful Philip Glass score also adds much to the film.",The Hours
246,dadynasty,"""How can you regret when you have no choice""",8,5 November 2003,"The Hours was a very good movie that exhibited of some the best acting I have seen in a long time. The acting of Ed Harris, Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and, especially Julianne Moore, was excellent. They gave their characters a sense of reality that made the viewer connect with each one of them. Many of the characters are not good people. They are selfish and make decisions that hurt the ones around them. Yet the movie does not apologize for them. It merely presents them.  Julianne Moore is quickly becoming my favorite actress due to her ability to convey deep emotions and thoughts through silence and subtlety. She is the tie that binds this movie together and she probably deserved the Oscar over Catherine Zeta-Jones. I haven't seen Chicago, but I doubt that Zeta-Jones was able to put forth such a vivid, intense character. Meryl Streep was also amazing, as she usually is. Nicole Kidman blew me away with her portrayal of Virginia Wolf. I had no idea of her ability due to the fact that I had not seen her in very many films. Ed Harris again shows his versatility and ability. Stephen Daldry is giving a very tough piece to direct and does so admirably. David Hare's screenplay was very well done even in its complexities. The Hours was the second-best film of 2002 behind Adaptation. I give it an 8 out of 10.",The Hours
247,hamilton-3,I respect this movie more than like it...,7,2 September 2003,"I respect this movie more than like it.  An interesting scrapbook of fine acting performances, but nevertheless it left me less involved than I expected to be.  Perhaps it is because the story is spread so thinly across the three time periods, or maybe it's because the story doesn't know where it's going.  There is an ""aha"" moment that eventually arrives, but it can't save the story from muddle.  Maybe those who are more familiar with literary precursors will appreciate it more.The luminous Julianne Moore has the toughest job, acting her way through yet another poorly written 1950's housewife role (as in ""Far From Heaven""). Jeff Daniels delivers a finely nuanced cameo performance. I wish I enjoyed the entire movie as much (7/10).",The Hours
248,Evil_Will_Hunting,shame on the Academy,1,17 February 2003,"Not that I've ever had much faith in the opinions of the Academy, but they really should be more careful in the movies that they glow over. Despite warnings from many of my loved ones, I saw this film primarily because of the outrageous amount of praise it had received. I don't really see the point in having so many Oscar categories when they end up just using them all to honor the same 5 films. (Did anyone else notice that the 5 best editing nominees are the same as the 5 best picture nominees?) There are so many other great, innovative films and performances (i.e. Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary, Zooey Deschanel in the Good Girl, Sam Rockwell in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) that never or barely even get acknowledged so that the same old players can have their day in the sun. ""The Hours"" deserves a directing nod perhaps, maybe best actress for Julianne Moore, and probably also something for Philip Glass' score (say what you will--it stood out and enhanced the mood), but otherwise I didn't find the film all that well written, even less entertaining, and in fact, I see little point to its ever having even been made. Yeah, I understand the point--literature living on throughout the generations. I'm a writer myself and that's certainly a goal of the craft. But what's the point of letting your story, or your ""song,"" live on if only to sap the life from all those you touch? It's not nearly as hard to be happy as every character in ""The Hours"" makes it seem. You just have to be a little less selfish, take a sincere interest in the wellbeing of others, and not dwell on the things that make you depressed. If you've seen ""The Hours"" and it filled you with hope and life, then good for you. But if you haven't and you're still mulling over whether or not to see it, I'd say there's a pretty fair chance you won't like it either. You're better off spending your ""hours"" watching something more inspiring like ""Adaptation"" or ""Bowling for Columbine.""P.S. My brother just wanted to add that he also thought this movie sucked.",The Hours
249,breezyweasel,"Good film, but the book was much better...",7,31 January 2003,"I must admit I was a bit disappointed by The Hours.  The omission of one scene in particular (immediately followed the climax event in the book) really annoyed me.  I thought Laura Brown's story could have been explained better.  In the book, she lies to the hotel clerk, claiming that her husband would be along shortly.  It made it more convincing to the reader that Brown was troubled and maybe a bit off mentally.  A little more explanation in the film would have been nice.SPOILER ALERT
And I also didn't care for the way they handled one character (and his younger self).  The kid was called ""Ritchie"" in the book.  Instead, Richard holds a picture of his mother up, a dead giveaway, and Daldry reveals this fact to the viewer even before the climax event.  The book handled this much better.  I was very upset he used such an obvious spoonfeeding approach; it was more like something I'd expect from Ron Howard than from Stephen Daldry. I really liked the part in the book when Brown and Vaughn meet, and Brown reveals her connection to Richard.SPOILER ALERT ENDI did NOT care for that ""train station"" scene.  The screaming and histrionics were not present in the book, nor were they necessary.I'm also surprised at all the acclaim for Nicole Kidman.  Of the three main actresses in this film, I felt Kidman gave easily the weakest performance. The scene in which her sister is leaving and she asks her if she's getting any better was outstanding, but the train station scene and many others weren't that great.  Screaming and flailing your arms around does not equal great acting.Streep was outstanding, and gave the best performance in the film.  The nervous breakdown scene reminded me of her performance in One True Thing, but that's mostly a good thing, as she was also outstanding in that film. Streep's scenes with Ed Harris, also excellent in his role, were among the best in the film.Moore gave one of her best performances ever.  I liked Moore better in The Hours than I did in Far from Heaven.  She was surprisingly good, and was probably the most subtle of the three.  I would have liked for the screenwriter or director to dump a few of Kidman's scenes and add scenes for Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.The child acting wasn't that great.  Brown's kid annoyed me.  His facial expressions and tone didn't always match the situation.  But I guess it's tough to find a good child actor.  Cute kid, but I would prefer not to see him again.  I was much more impressed with Natalie Portman in Leon and Lucas Black in Sling Blade.  The rest of the cast was excellent.  Richardson, Janney, Danes, Daniels, Reilly, Collette, and others did a fine job in the smaller roles of the film.The cinematography was good, although not award worthy.  The score was good, I guess, but it was relentless, intrusive, and sometimes even repetitive.  I wanted a break from Glass' score now and then.  The editing was overdone at the beginning of the film.  You get the connections between the women pounded into your head.  Again, Daldry slips into giving a Ron Howard-ish treatment of the subject matter with the editing, but overall, Daldry did a pretty good job telling the story and getting excellent performances out of the cast.I just wish he challenged his viewer a little bit and did more with Laura Brown's story.  This was a difficult book to adapt, so I give the screenwriter kudos for difficulty points, but I didn't approve of the addition of a temper tantrum in the train station scene or the deletion of a key scene after the climax event.  The film is filled with good performances.I'd give The Hours about a 7.5/10.",The Hours

Concurrent story lines, albeit in different decades were confusing and it wasn't until the last fifteen minutes of this epic that the pieces of the puzzle finally fit, but by that time, who cared!

257,mollilypan-97-771046,Addicted for Life,9,6 September 2015,"This movie, and the timing in which it came out, were just right to make an impact on my life. I was 22 when this was released and came out on VHS. I literally wore out the VHS tape because I watched it so often.I distinctly remember my gut reactions to this movie - especially to Clarissa's story line at the end. I felt that this movie was a truly interesting look at depression. It kind of makes you feel like: ""snap out of it"" at first. You get 3 different glances at three different female lives and at the beginning of the film it looks like all of them have pretty nice lives. It is also starkly obvious that none of them are happy in their ""nice lives."" This interests me particularly because the devastation is often pushed on to the depressed by those around them. It is very easy to think, or to say to them: ""you have a good life. why can't you be happy?"" The movie does not really address this for us. It does not tell us why they cannot be happy and I believe that is because each of these women wonder that a bit themselves - even to the extent of feeling some guilt about it. As each story unfolds it becomes obvious that their happiness or unhappiness is out of their control. Virginia has obviously battled her demons for most of her life and both her and her loved ones are close to the end of what they can bear. The first thing we see is Virginia's suicide, so you are warned very early that this movie is not going to be a gentle ride.Laura Brown was the most frustrating character to me personally. You can tell from the first glance of her that she's depressed. Her poor husband and child that both try so hard to connect with her but just cannot... and I felt so deeply for her little boy. It is obvious he knows something is wrong but also that he cannot fix it for her. It's a hard situation to watch. It's so important, though. Having a wonderful husband, children, a nice home... none of these things guarantee happiness.Clarissa is the character I sympathize with. She is longing for days past and is weighed down by her past - the things she she wishes she could return to and the opportunities she feels she missed. What I see as the watcher, though, is that maybe her expectations for herself and her life were just a little too high. I think this is an emotional place where many women find themselves.Here's my major spoiler - just a warning.The scene in which Richard commits suicide is so perfectly done. Meryl Streep's expression will stay with me forever. My husband accidentally sat down for the last half of of this movie a few days ago and I warned him: the end get rough. He just looked at me like that was silly. But when the end came, he was speechless. lol Many movies that touch on depression almost make my depression worse but this movie never has. I feel amazingly understood by the way this movie was handled.End game, it is a very well done movie. It's probably not the type of movie you want to show at a party, and I wouldn't say it's a really relaxing watch, but if you want to understand depression or want to feel that someone understands yours, hopefully this movie will help you too.",The Hours

To be honest, though, I couldn't even finish it. It was too horrendous.Not saying I'm straitlaced, because I have watched films like Rent, which expose the world of homosexuality, and I can handle the fact that there are people who march to a different drummer. But, this movie was way over the top for me. What started as an interesting movie changed into a 'Okay, who else is gay?' travesty. The over-dramatized relationship between Harris and Streep's characters, the provocative scenes not only lacked art and grace, but seemed to be more like fillers for an otherwise inane plot line.I'm still a fan of Kidman, but I was thoroughly disappointed with this low-class film.",The Hours

I yawned and squirmed in my seat for two hours as 'the action' switched between the three angst ridden female characters on screen. I would have walked out of the theatre after 40 minutes if I hadn't been there with a friend. As time dragged on I wondered to myself, what is the point of all this? The women in this 'story' are dissatisfied with their lot. So what? Does this make good drama? Not in my humble opinion.When it comes down to it, The Hours is nothing more than a high production value soap. Nicole Kidman's, Virginia Woolf had the personality of dish cloth. Talk about an unappealing character. Nicole's big nose was slightly amusing but I would have preferred a flashing red model. Anything to lighten the tone of this dreary movie.                A lot of people obviously love this film. A lot of people also love soap operas. Fine, I have no problem with that.

260,Donolog,OK ... but not a masterpiece,6,26 May 2003,"While I wouldn't necessarily categorize this film as a ""chick-flick"" (that I reserve for movies that have Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks and a happy ending), I do think it invariably will be a film that is better appreciated by women than men, particularly as a lot of it deals with the frustrations women face in relationships with men.Now don't get me wrong, I didn't ""not enjoy"" the film, I thought it was ""OK"". I'm guessing there are going to be a lot of people who think this film is a masterpiece, and while I may hesitate to get into an argument with them on this, I certainly won't agree.From a hetero-guy-point-of-view there was a couple of superficial disappointments off the start ... never has Nicole Kidman been so unsexy (not even when her hair was really frizzy), and never have lesbian kisses been so unsexy. Neither of those would be enough to turn me off a movie, but I had a hard time getting into this one.The film ultimately had some thematic points to make about enjoying the happy moments in life for what they're worth while they're happening, which is something I find compelling, but in the end these points were watered down by the overall drab atmosphere of the film. Last year's Iris managed to deal with this by constantly juxtaposing the drabness of the current situation with the vivacious moments of an earlier time in life.As the film progressed, I found myself caring less and less about the characters, and that runs contrary to what should have been the effect of a film like this. Claire Danes and Jeff Daniels did add some fresh air to the stuffiness towards the end of the film, but hardly enough to turn things around (not that the film should have been about fresh air).Kudos goes to whomever cast Jack Rovello as Julianne Moore's child. He truly had a haunting look to him that brought his role out of the wallflower it could have been. I can only hope the M. Night Shyamalan casts him for a future film, as I think there is potential there for a great child role as always seem to be in Shyamalan's films.Bottom line: 6/10.",The Hours

Nicole Kidman's Virgina Woolf is a bit of a miracle, specially now, 5 years later, when you can actually look at her without noticing her nose. What you do notice is her thinking, her beautifully torturous battle for sanity - whether conscious or unconscious - ""Even crazy people want to be asked!- she blurts at her sister to admonished her for not having been invited to a party. Kidman is truly sensational as is Meryl Streep, although one has come to expect that and that's why Kidman makes the bigger splash. Julianne Moore however, as the depressed perfect mother/wife of the 1950's, took me completely out of the emotional tornado Kidman and Streep consistently nurture and provide.

Ed Harris, too.  My favorites from ""The Hours"", though, are Toni Collette, Julianne Moore, Stephen Dillane, and, especially, Nicole Kidman.Moore's part of the film is written too vaguely, so it's up to the actor to make her housewife's sense of suffocation corporeal.  I think she is outstanding.Stephen Dillane, portraying Leonard Woolf, is perhaps overshadowed by the film's stars.  His performance is exceptionally strong, I thought, and his scene with Nicole Kidman, as Virginia Woolf, at the train station is, in my opinion, one of the film's very, very best.The movie works best when Daldry gets up close: lets the actors bring the script and story to life with their marvelous talents.  The score is distracting, but probably jammed in by the producers to give the film that an Oscar ""feel"".  I would have preferred the producers follow Daldry's instincts.  Looking at how masterfully he filmed the scenes between Streep and Harris, in which thier complicated rapport was practically palpable, it's hard to believe this is only Mr. Daldry's second feature.",The Hours

There is nobody happy in this movie, nobody glad to be alive, only misery. I had read the IMDb comments about this film before I watched it. There was so much praise, so many inspired essays, I knew the movie had be to good. Plus, all the females in it are among my favorites. What I did not read in ANY of the commentary is, this movie is about the dysfunctional nature of relationships resulting from aberrant sexual behavior. I'm trying to be politically correct, don't want to offend any of the well-adjusted deviants might read this. Good for you. However, for all of the folks praised this movie, why did you not say what this thing was really about?

Visually apt for each setting giving a clear indication as the film, at points cuts quickly between time periods.All 3 characters portray a confusion, worry and concern about their own lives unfolding and how they are failing to come to terms with it affecting others.Phillip Glass provides a fantastic rolling arpeggio score which seems to pervade throughout the film, really helping to connect the separate story lines.A fascinating, powerful & moving film that somehow cleverly maintains grip right to the end.",The Hours
266,NoCreamNoSugar,why do i care about these characters?,4,9 September 2003,"I had trouble caring for these characters. The moment you meet them they're all depressed and pathetic. If this were a tragedy, I could have something to respect in these people. Alex in A Clockwork Orange is a rapist, but he can appreciate art, and is charismatic. But these people are just depressed and hateful of existence. This film feels like empathy for the weak. If you don't like your situation, change it, don't whine. I mean, if these women had ANY admirable qualities I would still care about them despite their fecklessness.Nicole Kidman did *not* deserve an award for her work. She wore a funny nose, used a brit accent, and was generally unpleasant to those around her. That's not hard to do. Heavy-handed symbolism (broken eggs = abortions way to escape) reminded me of Magnolia's frog-rain. (equally ridiculous).",The Hours

I don't think Nicole Kidman did a spectacular performance, a great one, but not spectacular. However, Julianne Moore, in my opinion, was the best, she gave Laura Brown such depth. Meryl Streep was good too. The Hours made me ponder about life, death, wrong decisions(a situation that we all encounter). It has so much in it that I don't think one can fully understand the movie/book unless you dedicate yourself to find out about Virginia Woolf and maybe Michael Cunningham. Toni Collete had a very small role, yet important, she was good too, but she could have done better, judging by her previous work. All in all, people who want to think, watch this.

I'm thinking that maybe if they hadn't read the book, they would not like it that much, but I watched the movie before buying book, and I loved the movie too. One of my all-time favourite movies and books, I gave it a 10/10. Julianne Moore deserved the Oscar. Ed Harris, Jeff Daniels, Claire Danes, Allison Janney, Stephen Dillane, Toni Collette and Miranda Richardson were all spectacular. The acting is powerful, and the story is touching, can't wait for the DVD to be delivered to my house! I especially liked Miranda Richardson, Allison Janney and Toni Collette, Allison Janney they most. They cut off the scene where she bought the flowers and was talking with the producer, that would have shown that she was also just as sad as the 3 main characters, well everyone was sad in the story, except Claire Danes.

269,p-braham,magnificent,10,16 October 2006,"The film exposes the cultural straitjackets of two separate periods of the 20th century and weaves them together with a third, more liberated and contemporary setting, to create one interconnected story. Nicole Kidman gives an excellent portrayal of a distracted, haunted, depressed Virginia Woolf. Stephen Dillane gives a beautifully understated performance as her husband Leonard, desperate not to show his desperation. Meryl Streep does very well in a complex role and creates one of the best scenes in the film opposite Jeff Daniels. Suffice to say - well acted throughout. But what distinguishes this film is the magical way it discovers interconnectedness between the lives of the characters and the life of Woolf's fictional character, Mrs Dalloway. I don't want to say too much about that as I think it is better experienced than described.In conclusion: Intelligently constructed, superbly casted and acted. Judicious use of quality music.

270,bersarhin,The journey through life and death,10,27 April 2006,"Why do I love this film? Is it just the breath-taking performances? Is it the flawless screenplay? Is it the simple but exquisite production design? Or is it a special ""it"" factor that apparently not only happens with performers?The Hours is a magnificent work of art by a man who had already given us a magical film (Billy Elliot): Stephen Daldry. But since one is a tale of hope, The Hours actually gives you a sense of emptiness and sadness, but at the same time, many thoughts that circle ""Life and Death"".The Hours shows us that these two (Life and Death) aren't too different, they're just part of a cycle and the lives and deaths of others reign our own. All three stories showed dependence on other people.Clarissa Vaughan's (Meryl Streep in one of her best performances yet) life circles around Richard Brown, (Ed Harris in what I think is his best performance ever. Short but powerful.) a gay writer dying of AIDS. Richard is her heartbreak, but also her heartbeat. She says it herself: Richard is the only person that makes her feel anything, that makes her feel human. And Richard understand that, and that's why he decides to kill himself. He feels Clarissa needs to learn to feel again without her. he's teaching her of life through death.Laura Brown (Julianne Moore, as fantastic as usual) is definitely not alive. She was living a life that was not hers and therefore decided death would just be a simple step for her to take. How wrong she was. In the end, there was a tiny glimpse of life lying deep inside her that made her see the life she was living was definitely not hers, but there were other ways out. Once again, Richard Brown (but as a child, played professionally by 8 year old Jack Rovello in one of the best performances by a young actor I've ever seen) is the reason of ""life"" for a character. Laura tries to feel love for her son but doesn't achieve it. His son is what makes her realize she needs to escape. Many people consider Laura a lesbian, but this is not true. Her kiss with Kitty is her expression to show her inner desperation. Laura can't be judged for leaving her family, and this is what Clarissa learns at the end of the film, because Clarissa had also felt this desperation, of leaving everything to pursue her heartbeat (in Clarissa's case Richard, and in Laura's case escaping from Richard).And finally comes the character that joins all this stories together: Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman in my favourite female performance of all time). We all know the life or Virginia Woolf. We can just tell that her life was based upon death just by reading any of her books. For example in her book Jacob's room, she presents the main character as obsessed with a skull. She also says the line that describes the whole movie: ""He will die, in order for the rest of us to appreciate life."" All of her lines are perfectly written to fit with the rest of the movie. She also presents a perfect symbolism. Did you notice that Woolf's heartbeat and heartbreak is Richmond? I believe this is why Richard is Richard. (This probably is more clear on the book that I haven't dared to read yet). Virginia, as the other two women, wants to escape from her life (or in Virginia's case, the town her husband dragged her to) and shows a prohibited kiss (as the other two) to show her desperation.Writing this was extremely difficult since I have too much to say about this film and my mind just gets cramped with ideas. This is the movie that has made me think the most in my life, therefore it's my favourite film. This is the film that finally made me realize I want to dedicate the rest of my life to cinema.",The Hours
271,Jasimia,Here's the thing,5,20 March 2005,"This movie misses the point. It's long and dull with no sense of entertainment. There are some truly wonderful performances hidden in here, but when you boil this movie down, it's just three hours of very talented people crying. This film doesn't move me, and it is just an average film. Some may call me stupid and unsophisticated, but let me assure you, i generally appreciate more slowly paced films. But here the Hours shares a problem with Mystic River, it is too one-note. A movie shouldn't be about how bleak people can make it, but should have some kind of shifting emotion center to keep us involved. Both this and Mystic River are depression pieces, and the only emotion is depression. I like to think of films as roller coasters, and in the Hours and Mystic River the roller coaster is flat and dull and no one would want to ride it. A movie doesn't have to be an action film to provide a satisfying roller coaster ride, take Sideways, perhaps my favorite movie about depression. Sideways makes us happy, sad, depressed and hopeful. Take Picnic at Hanging Rock, which has a similar pace. Picnic was suspenseful, eerie, sad, and puzzling. Take Schindler's List, it was hopeful, terrifying, depressing, and celebratory. The Hours and Mystic River were just about the depression, and while depression is a valid subject, making a three hour movie just watching depressed people go about is not entertainment.",The Hours
272,BeMi21,A Movie About Life,10,16 June 2014,"Three women, three different lives, but all women are connected by the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"": One woman writes Mrs. Dalloway, the second woman reads Mrs. Dalloway, the last woman is Mrs. Dalloway. What else connects these three women? They are unhappy. The movie follows the three women for exactly one day: In 1923 Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), the famous English writer, lives with her husband Leonard in Richmond, however, she doesn't feel well there. She misses the ""urban"" London life, but her husband wants her to stay in quiet Richmond due to her struggle with mental illness. Although the doctors support Leonard in that idea, Virginia suffers, she feels dominated and not being taken serious and she wants to move back to London. Additional to that she has problems with writing a new novel but on this day, she finally starts with Mrs. Dalloway. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) seems to live the American Dream with her husband and her young son in Los Angeles in 1951. But it becomes clear that this is not the life she always wanted, it is not the life which satisfies her. She escapes her everyday life by reading the novel Mrs. Dalloway. In 2001 Clarissa (Meryl Streep) lives together with her girlfriend in New York where she takes care of her friend Richard, an author who suffers from AIDS in an advanced stage, but Clarissa wants to keep him alive and tries to convince him to stay alive, though he seems to lose his will to live. Richard receives a literary award and therefore Clarissa wants to give a party for him. The movie is carried by its great screenplay, by its depressing score and (most of all) by the three superb performances by Kidman, Moore and Streep. Streep gives one of her best performances of the 2000s by portraying a complex character, whose problems don't seem obvious but became clearer and clearer the more often you watch this movie. Moore is wonderfully fragile. Her facial expression shows us how trivial her current life seems to her character. Her performance would have deserved the Supporting Actress Oscar. But still, my favorite performance is Kidman's mentally unstable Virginia Woolf. She embodies her perfectly, her stare, her tremble, her angled movements seem almost scary. I'd like to mention that also the supporting cast - lead by Ed Harris' amazing performance - is first class. A great movie and character study with one of the best ensemble cast I've ever seen.",The Hours

The fact it got any awards seems a joke in itself. The Hours was somehow connected to a story about three women all having to deal with the concepts of suicide through a Virginia Wolfe novel. I would have wished they had killed themselves earlier in the movie so it could end more entertainingly than the bland ending full of 'concept' and 'artistic value'. After watching the Hours (joke) i had fully decided to become a conspiracy theorist! I honestly thought to myself; I think this is a sick joke, that the director is just making this stupid movie to see whether or not people consider it new vogue entertainment. That perhaps anyone is too gutless to admit that this is crap, and that it really doesn't have story or ideas. It is an airy fairy pile of whoo ha.

This was the first time I've seen Julianne Moore in a film, and she was also wonderful.  Her storyline left me wondering constantly.  The boy who played her son was magnificent, as well as John C.

It had the energy, and the sheer presence of these amazing women, but its actually story was not compelling enough to turn it into a memorable film. It just wasn't intriguing enough for me to enjoy. It was in fact, a boring movie. The ending was so bland and predictable. It was obvious that the connection needed to be made between the two women, but it was not a good connection. I don't know how one would acheive the ending, without making it a little melodramatic and dumbed down, as it was- but I do know that it wasn't acheived.

279,NICKAK413,Brilliant,10,14 May 2003,"""The Hours"" is a brilliantly depressing tale of three women who see no interest in their every day lives. First, we meet the depressed, bisexual author Virginia Woolf (an Academy Award winning performance by Nicole Kidman) who has just been released from a mental institution and is beginning to write the famous novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" in 1923. Then we meet Laura Brown (Academy Award nominee Julianne Moore), a 1951 pregnant housewife who is depressed with her everyday family life. She loves her husband and son, but she feels she can't be with them anymore or she'll hurt herself. Last we meet Clarissa ""Dalloway"" Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a 2001 editor living in New York City with her lover Sally and her daughter Julia. Clarissa's greatest friend, Richard (Academy Award nominee Ed Harris), is dying of AIDS. She's throwing a party in his honor for he just won the Carrouther's Prize for his lifelong career in poetry. Richard also does not want to live the rest of his few short hours because he feels he's only staying alive for Clarissa. This film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 2002 (though it only brought won home). Nicole Kidman's Oscar-winning performance is absolutely perfect. She is one of the most deserving Academy Award winners (right next to Angelina Jolie in 1999 and Timothy Hutton in 1980 and Robert De Niro in 1974 and 1980). All performances are wonderful including Kidman, Moore, Streep, Harris, Toni Collette, Jack Rovello, John C.

280,phlipps12,Virginia Woolf's essence lives on,10,3 January 2003,"My parents dragged my siblings and I to the movie ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" when we were very small. I remember thinking that Virginia ""Wolf"" must be a scary and negative character. Of course, the mindless yelling in the movie went right over my 8 year old head. Imagine my surprise years later to discover the genius of Virginia Woolf in ""A Room of Her Own."" I read ""The Hours,"" and immediately understood the obsession that a person like Michael Cunningham could have for her. In reading the book, I wanted to reach out to her and say, ""It's okay; everything will be alright. You will affect generations of intellectuals to come."" Most writers just want to be remembered. The rest of us strive to understand her, and it will likely never happen.  However, I doubt many actresses could have captured the intensity of Virginia Woolf like Nicole Kidman. And yes, she was along side the best actresses of our time; but there was truly something beyond just 'acting' that was required by the role. (I'm not just referring to the nose, either) I predict that Kidman will be considered the actors' actress from now on, and will continue to grow. Yikes! Kidman is as mysterious as Woolf. The person that casted Kidman was a genius. See the movie! Read the book, and read Virginia Woolf! The only disappointment in the movie is that they did not include a line from the book, which showed the clever wit of Mrs. Woolf. After her sister arrives early, Woolf says, ""If I told you that I was happy to see you, you can imagine how ecstatic I'd have been if you'd arrived at the time you were expected.""",The Hours

Stephen Daltry captured the essence of Cunningham's book, and took ""poetic license"" in the right places. How can you go wrong with Streep, Kidman, Moore, Collette, Janney, Richardson, and Dane in the female roles? and of course Ed Harris, and the guy who played Leonard Woolf.

I like a movie with nuance, but not a movie that throws that for glorifying suicide.  This movie is very artsy in that it makes suicide romantic.  I would definitely not recommend it suicidal person.  The whole concept insults the suburban life as inconsequential.

This film also has a magnificent twist at the end (you will never see it coming but it is superb) It was shot beautifully and the costumes (particularly the Kidman's story) were superb.It as to be said that to get the most out of this film a bit of work on behalf of the viewer is required, but,if you are prepare to concentrate on the three interconnecting stories (which at the same time are separate) and enjoy superb acting then this is a rewarding film.",The Hours

Both of us regretted bothering with it, deeming Kidman's performance nothing less than morbid--a continuous downcast countenance, mumbled lines, and dowdy costuming put the Kidman character into perspective.That Hollywood actors, directors and writers are so infatuated with their own works is proved only by the esteem by which it was regarded at Oscar Night.

Definitely I am at the ¡¥love¡¦ side.  The film is simply much more than having a good script (which nowadays it is not easy to find a film with good script.  BTW, script in Chinese translation means the fundamental of film).  It has so much level in the message that the crew to convey.  It is a bit of surprise to find that the director is a male rather than female.  It is not just a film depicting the tedious and miserable situation that women were facing.  The film is challenging our thoughts.What is so moving about this film ¡V when Virginia said to Leonard (her husband) you cannot find peace by avoiding life. Be true to oneself. One cannot find peace in living in a life of others (with other¡¦s expectation). One¡¦s love may hinder one¡¦s or other¡¦s freedom.  Look at Leonard vs. Virginia. Look at Clarissa vs Richard. And subtly, Richard vs Louis.  If you love someone, let him/ her go.It is also a time line measuring the liberation of woman.  Where Virginia was unable to choose her life but ridiculously pursuing her second life in writing.  Laura could not choose her life until she gave birth to her second child. She left her family by then.  Clarissa lived with her female partner and she had a daughter and she never met her daughter¡¦s husband.The editing, the script, the acting, the directing were very good.  It deserves more attention/ discussion/ appreciation than just pure glamour at Oscar and Golden Globes.",The Hours
291,czjrox_2,The Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen,10,6 November 2007,"I've seen so many movies in my life that it would be easier to ask how many I haven't seen but out of all of those movies, The Hours was by far the best. After watching it I went out and bought the Hours and Mrs. Dalloway and read them both within a week. Every single character seemed to be made especially for the actors that played them, the music was fantastic, did I say the acting was phenomenal? Every single minimal part of this movie added to its perfection, down to the set design, types of flowers, and music featured in the film.Kidman, Streep, Moore, and Harris, the leading actors are all at the top of their game in what I think was their best work yet. Especially Nicole Kidman, who I would have never thought to be a GREAT actress, brought me to tears several times during the film because her acting was so beautiful. I've watched the movie several, several times and every time I watch it I am mesmerized for those two hours. The Hours never ceases to amaze.",The Hours
292,NickFalk,Some books should not be made into films...,5,31 March 2003,"""The Hours"" seems to be one of these books. I am not familiar with the book, but suspect that the whole parallel, structure of showing Virginia Wolf's influence on the lives of others works a lot better in book-form.While the cinematography is simply stunning and the acting (for the most part) accomplished this just doesn't work for me.  Early on I was irritated by the too ""in your face"" rightness of the cutting between the different stories. While, it is of course theoretically very ""right"" the whole thing seemed contrived to me and immediately pulled me out of the ""reality"" of the movie.I also felt that the three stories were presented with to brief glimpses at the beginning, not giving the viewer a proper chance to invest emotionally in any of the characters.As mentioned earlier the acting is pretty good all-round but not flawless. I personally found one scene with Kidman (on the train-station) to be over-played to the extent that I almost burst out laughing. The best performance of the movie is in my opinion Julian Moore's brilliant portrayal of Laura Brown. The academy definitely `cheated' her of an Oscar when they decided to give one to Catharine Zeta-Jones instead.Personally I found it very hard to feel much for the two other leads. My problem is that their characters seem to exist only to suffer. Finally I find the Meryl Streep part of the film rather uninteresting, but I suspect this has more to do with where I am in life, and that I can't really identify with her problems.All in all, I found ""The Hours"" to be a brave but flawed attempt at doing something different. As mentioned above I believe this has mainly to do with the nature of the literal work it is based on. A good book does not necessarily make a good film and this one is a prime example of this mantra.5/10",The Hours
293,cyrus33139,It Sure Felt Like Hours.,4,18 January 2003,"I knew when walking into the theatre that I was going to love this movie. I knew that I was supposed to love this movie.  At the 3/4 mark in the movie I was wondering when the love for this movie was going to well up.  What clever plot twist would show the brilliance that I just knew had to be lurking just 'round the corner?  By the end I didn't feel love for this movie...I felt cheated.I will agree with everyone else...the acting was, for the most part, top notch.  Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep delivered as always.  Nicole Kidman's performance was, I felt, noticeably weaker.  And Claire Danes is always a treat, even in a very small role. Ed Harris' performance was adequate, if a bit overacted.  But acting aside, I really did not like this movie.  I can't for the life of me understand the rave reviews.  At no point was I able to see into any of the characters.  Some films deliberately create a sense of isolation by not allowing a connection between the audience and one, or some, of the characters.  I'm pretty certain that this was not the intention here.  I think I was supposed to be moved by the sense of loneliness that dominated each of the main characters.  I think I was supposed to empathize with them in their battles with the mundanity of life. I couldn't.  I think I was supposed to feel for them in their struggle with neuroses.  I didn't.  I think I was supposed to think that the way the three stories were woven together was a stroke of artistic genius.  It wasn't. I really didn't feel anything at all throughout the movie, except cheated.",The Hours
294,vera_upr,good movie syndrome,10,8 March 2003,"Wow, I am really surprised for some of the comments posted here. I think 'The Hours' is being the victim of the ""good movie syndrome"". When so many critics and non-critics say that a movie is great, there come the people who watch the movie and say ""nah, it's not that good"" for just not to be part of the crowd. And when the movie is nominated for the Oscar, things go rougher. Anyway, I LOVE the film. Out of the three marvelous actresses that played the main roles, my favorite by far was Julianne Moore. I really hope she gets the Oscar. About the plot, I'd admit that 'The Hours' is a movie for women (in the political sense) and that makes it very special to my heart. Maybe for that reason, I didn't find it depressing. I think the film is a hymn to the dignity of the human being, to the right to choose what's best for us and to the courage to be different and seek for our happiness.",The Hours
295,shobhadeepthi,The Hours Of Our Lifes,8,19 April 2011,"What is Life made of? Meaningless routines? Regrets? Happiness? Quietness? Peace? Movie ""The Hours"" is based on life's of three women of three different generations. All they have in common is despair. Hopelessness. Desperate need to find a meaning to their life's and hence happiness. Novel ""Mrs Dalloway"" connects all these three women. One woman an author, one woman who reads this novel and reflects on her own way of living, one woman who is actually living the novel.Virginia Wolf is the author of the book ""Mrs Dalloway"" who is suffering from depression, hallucinations. She has failed twice with her suicide attempts. She is advised by doctors to stay in a serene, quite place Richmond away from London. Which to her is death. She prefers violent jolt of city life to eerie suburbs. She has a loving husband who is constantly threatened by her suicidal tendency. To her sister Nessa, Virginia's life seems perfect and thinks Virginia is very fortunate to live two life's. One that Virginia is leading and the book that she is writing. Virginia believes that there is certainty in death. Death is the only possible escape for her. This reflects so much in her novel where she is trying to kill one of the characters. When her husband questions why someone has to die, she says ""Someone has to die in order that the rest of us should value life more. It's contrast"" ""You cannot find peace by avoiding life, Leonard."" Laura Brown is a pregnant housewife with a doting husband and a kid. She thinks she has lost her own life in being a wife, a mother. She is very unfulfilled and struggles to cope with a life that is ordained on her. A life without choices. She makes every effort to fit in, yet she is so unhappy and depressed. All this lead to thoughts of killing herself. What happens to her? Does she kill herself? Does she go back to her family and continue to live a life that does not define her? Or does she make a choice after all which she may or may not regret? ""It would be wonderful to say you regretted it. It would be easy. But what does it mean? What does it mean to regret when you have no choice? "" Clarissa Vaughan is the one who is living the novel Mrs Dalloway. A modern-day woman living with her gay partner. Who reassures herself that her life is not trivial by throwing parties and trying to be a good hostess. This is a meaningless routine that she builds to make her otherwise meaningless life worthy. She has an adopted girl child, a good career, a loving partner. But she cannot get over her young love Richard. Richard is an award winning poet, gay, and is suffering from AIDS.Richard and Clarissa share a beautiful relationship. Clarissa regrets her decision of losing her true love, soul-mate, friend Richard. She feels insignificant without Richard.""Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been"" All of these woman have someone who loves them, who have something to carry on their life's with. But life is not about the hours that we live isn't it? It is not those meaningless hours that you spend on routines, years that you spend on trying to hold on a thing which is not you. Life is not the choices we made or not made. Life is about moments. Right there. Right then.""I remember one morning getting up at dawn, there was such a sense of possibility. You know, that feeling? And I remember thinking to myself: So, this is the beginning of happiness. This is where it starts. And of course there will always be more. It never occurred to me it wasn't the beginning. It was happiness. It was the moment. Right then."" This movie may not be a perfect drama, may not help you in finding a meaning to life. May not give you a perspective. But it shows life as is and the rest is left to viewer's interpretations. Most of the movie is up for your own perspective. This is not a sad story either. There are lot of positive messages through out the movie.""To look life in the face, always, to look life in the face and to know it for what it is. At last to know it, to love it for what it is, and then, to put it away. Leonard, always the years between us, always the years. Always the love. Always the hours.""

I was so upset by this movie that I was talking back at my TV as I watched it. (Not a common occurence, by the way!) I felt manipulated by the obvious symbolism and annoying scene changes. I felt insulted by the blatant references to this wonderful literary masterpiece (sarcasm here) which I have had the misfortune not to have read before. Therefore I must not be able to give an opinion of this movie as I would not know what I was talking about! Well I know a good movie when I watch one, and this was not it! I don't call it entertainment to be purposefully depressed for no real reason. I've noticed that most of the people who didn't like this movie happen to be men. I would like it known, that I am not, nor ever have been a man or even at all masculine by nature. I do have a lot of common sense, however and can not really relate to this repressed womanhood issue.

297,chyna1980-1,A great movie but not a winner for the Academy,7,21 February 2003,"I admit that I think you more open to this movie, you would like it better.  I think the guys are more the ones that don't like it as much as the women.  My bf and I went to see the movie yesterday and I had more the interest on what was going through with the movie, then my bf did.  All he was saying this movie was not the greatest, but I didn't care what he was saying, because I liked it more than he did.  Now if I had to pick a winner for the Academy in this movie, I would say Nicole Kidman would be the winner, as much as I hated her in Moulin Rougue she did so well in this performance than anyone else.  Everybody did as good I admit that, but I was more interested in Virginia Wolf and the performance Ed harris did in the movie.  I think the makeup for both actors was so well done, that even if you didn't know that Nicole Kidman was in this movie, her makeup was definately blind blowing, that I never would of guess it was her.  As for Ed harris, you can tell it was him, but they it really look like he was going to die, by the way he looked.  I can also tell that he lost weight for that part because he was skin and bones, and not that many people will do that for their parts.  Last time I saw a man that lost so much weight for the movie was Donnie Walberg in the Sixth Sense.  BRAVO for Ed Harris.  Julianne more did so well in this movie, to but I won't expect her to win for the Academy.  Her character was so well done, that I was either hating her or loving her.  As for Meryl Streep, even though she got nominated for another movie, whaich did so well in the other one, this one was more like I wasn't interested in her character, just her friend Richard(Ed).  Would I recommend to see this movie hell yeah, but unless you are less open minded with this movie, than don't even try, because you will not like it at all.",The Hours

What kept me watching was the incredible acting done by everyone on the screen. Our three main women -- Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nichole Kidman were beyond scoring a ten. They were fantastic -- so believable. Kidman, wearing a false nose, was so dowdy it was hard to find her. She totally became Virginia Wolfe. Julianne Moore was incredible in her silent suffering.

301,lwaldo25,A beautiful movie...how refreshing,10,24 February 2004,"It's nice to know that the Hollywood machine isn't completely oblivious to those of us who appreciate a great story and even greater acting.For those who do not get this movie and do not understand the plight of the three women involved, no this movie is not for you. Perhaps you'd rather have gone to the latest Ben Affleck disaster-of-a-film instead. The key issue in these women's lives are their own control over their emotions and their destiny. One woman decides to leave her life by death. One woman decides to leave her life by deserting her family. One woman decides to leave her life in the past and embrace the future ahead of her. This movie is about choices and consequences and the relationship one has with oneself. It's about self preservation and identity. How a woman forms her identity and what she does to change it with the cards she is dealt - this is what gives this movie its backbone. These characters are real. Their emotions and strain were almost unbearable to watch because they were so believable.There were many moments I found myself holding my breath because of what they were allowing us to experience. Keep in mind that most of this film takes place in a pre-Prozac existence when Sigmund Freud was all the rage and modern psychiatry was decades away. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep are amazing. With so many duds being released and labeled ""motion pictures"" it's refreshing to sit down to a movie that actually makes you earn the reward of the ending. This is a thinking woman's movie - all others need not apply.",The Hours
302,angelina_gia,Both depressing and refreshing.,10,12 March 2003,"Seeing how the world looks through all these eyes, I became lost in the film. It's utterly absorbing. Steven Daldry pulls you inside each of the 3 main female characters, begging you to give them a chance with their flaws and even embrace your own. Nicole Kidman certainly deserves her Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Viginia Woolf, from her voice, to her watery eyes and sighing, to her obsession with having her hand in her front pocket. She is mesmerising. Julianne is perfectly understated, and Meryl has you feeling as overwhelmed as her character, Clarissa, but feeling as free at the end. I have a feeling with this film, as I did a couple of years ago with American Beauty - when I walked out of the Cinema seeing the world differently. And with an open mind and heart but also a level of acceptance but also mild anxiety for everything that would be to follow. That it never going to get easier - this life. And the same thing is happening with the people who, for some reason or another don't understand that, or, in a way, can handle it better and don't need films like these to make them feel they belong, or to make them feel comfortably depressed, and that they're not alone in their feelings.In my opinion it is the best film I've seen all year, but if you're happy, seriously, and can handle everything, and you sleep well, and things just pass through you - you will either learn from the film, or think it's boring because you just don't understand. Try and learn from it.",The Hours

I have no idea what this movie is trying to say. I couldn't even understand the story. As for realistic? That's a joke. Nothing of what I've experience in my own life was shown in the entire movie. It came somewhat close at the part where Nicole Kidman is talking to her husband at the train station, but it still didn't play out right. The best I can say for this movie is it kept my attention, mostly hoping I would get some kind of explanation for what was happening but I was still pretty confused by the end.

The acting by Nicole Kidman was remarkably amazing (I'm really happy she won the Oscar for it), Meryl Streep was good and Julianne Moore was not so bad, but this is it. The adaptation to the film was poor (yes, that's what I think), sometimes confusing. I'd never thought I'd say this, but it was boring, the film was boring, and thank God I had a lovely girl by my side, otherwise I would have killed myself along with... well, you know. It didn't play with my emotions, it didn't have passion; too many things going on, too much back and forth, too much symbolism, unfinished, etc., etc. A little less of each one and I would have been able to call it a smart thing to see in a screen, although not great yet. I'm not saying it was a failure, but the film could have been way more exquisite. I would recommend to read the book first and then watch the movie.

308,justjerel,. . .seemed more like days,2,17 February 2003,"With such a stellar cast, my expectations were naturally very high going in to this movie.  As I love character-driven movies more than story or plot in terms of overall enjoyment, again I felt that this would be a terrific vehicle to have a truly cerebral experience.  I have to say that I was terribly disappointed, and moreover quite outraged at the oscar committee for their nominations concerning this movie.Being totally fair, the construction of the parallel lives at different time periods and the common theme that cut through this was very intruiging and should have made for a wonderful film.  Unfortunately, the script and the amount of information that we have about the characters is so inept that we never know enough to identify with or get in to them.  I think lots of people are too timid to say much negative about this film for fear of being considered uneducated or unrefined, as the cast is so strong and the oscar committee has annointed the film as a triumph.  I can tell you that this is the first movie that I've been too in many years where almost everyone coming out of the theater had something to say about how unenjoyable it was.The music was very appropriate to the melancholy air that never lifted, but that same piano interlude became so repetitive that it was nauseous by the end.  The costuming and make-up was quite good, depicting the disparate time periods quite well and giving one a clear sense of the time distinctions. If I had to describe my feeling of the overall impact of the film in one word, I would say ""Boring.""  It just never engages you and makes you want to stay with it.  None of the female performances is even close to being worthy of a nomination, supporting or otherwise.  Ed Harris does a decent job of depicting an Aids-ravaged man.  Allison Janney's role could have been played by anyone walking down the street to the same effect.  The strongest performance by far, and without any doubt, is from the boy who plays Julianne Moore's son.  His body language speaks volumes and communicates so much more than anything that the main characters ever say.  He at least gave the scenes that he was in meaning and one felt engaged at those times.Finally, there was just no reason whatsoever for the gratuitous female-female kissing.  It was so forced and unnatural as to be totally ludicrous.  I cannot recommend this movie on any level, and I would never agree with anyone who finds it to have any redeeming value whatsoever.  If anything from this movie having to do with the acting or the story wins an oscar, it will be a joke.

The film is more than based on the novel. I didn't like the book too much and I neither didn't get into the book. I hoped that the movie would clear things from the book up. And it did. The Hours is an usual film version of a successful book. Nothing more nothing less. It's not special in any way. Maybe the book is and that makes the film also a bit different from normal from-book-to-film films. Actresses are good in their roles. They match the ideas that I had about the book's women.

315,Pbearadactyl,She Won By Her Nose,7,16 November 2013,"This movie (which is based a Pulitzer Prize winner novel) does not work as movie. It features three separate stories yet it feels like it has no resolution what so ever. The first story is about Virginia Woolf (Played By Nicole Kidman with a fake nose) dealing with her mental illness and struggling to write her novel Mrs Dalloway, the second is about Laura Brown a 50s housewife Played By Julianne Moore who is reading Mrs Dalloway and contemplating whether or not she should abandon her family, and the third is about a modern New Yorker named Clarissa Vaughan (played by Meryl Streep) who is embodying Mrs Dalloway by preparing a party of her friend who is dying of AIDS and is played by Ed Harris. The film begins and ends with Virginia Woolf's suicide for no other reason then to give the film some kind of resolution as none of the stories are really ever resolved. There is the constant problem of characters talking about something, but not telling you anything about it. Ed Harris's character is supposed to have written a book based on his life and the people in his story constantly talk about it, but we never learn anything about him through these conversations. The thematic connection between the stories barely exists and I did not get any sense that seeing a book being written told me anything about a person reading it or embodying it. When the movie was over I got a sense that I watch three loosely related vignettes that were edited together in order to give the illusion of interconnectedness. The structure of the story would probably lend itself better to a novel than to a film which makes sense given its origins as one. The acting was very good overall and while not her best performance Nicole Kidman was deservedly given an Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf. Although the fake nose did increase her chances.",The Hours
316,schrammbledeggs,Beautiful...,8,19 April 2009,"This movie started out slow and ended up excellent. Starring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore, The Hours is a parable following the 3 parallel story lines of the aforementioned actresses and how their lives are connected by the plot of a novel that Nicole Kidman's character is writing. The acting is excellent, obviously, considering the actresses in the movie. There's also a surprisingly excellent supporting cast including Ed Harris, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney, and John C. Reilly. What REALLY makes this movie excellent is the fantastic musical score. Philip Glass really hit the nail on the head here with his musical selections. This movie is worth seeing just to hear the score.",The Hours

The last film that had this affect on my was ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", although I would not compare the two films.  I read Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer winning novel before seeing the film and loved it.  I was anxious to see how it would be adapted to the screen.  David Hare did a masterful job.  Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep were all amazing and projected beyond the screen.  It was if you knew these women, that they could have come into the cinema and sat down beside you.  One of the scenes that I can't get out of my head was when ""Virginia"" meets her husband at the train station.  Listen carefully to her words.  Special mention to Toni Collette, as ""Laura Brown's"" friend.  Look at her movements, check out her eyes and her mouth.  Truly amazing acting.  Ed Harris was wonderful as well.  His character's relationship with ""Clarissa"" appeared honest and complicated and true.  Oscars all around..although I know this is not possible.  My only reservation was the musical score by Philip Glass.  I loved the circular movements but felt that the film did not need the support.  At times it was too loud, too in-your-face, for my taste.",The Hours

Also, Claire Danes confirms that she is one of the most underused actresses of our time.",The Hours
322,TheHitchcockBlonde,Unimpressed (possible spoilers),4,28 March 2003,"I found The Hours disappointing for many reasons.Firstly, I don't believe Nicole Kidman's performance was worthy of a Best Actress Oscar. (Even though I'm an Aussie!) She won because she's quite the Hollywood It Girl at the moment, and because she was playing against type. (Read: ugly) Her acting was fine, but she was only on screen for around a third of the film.This brings me to my second point; there were too many characters to be properly engaged with any of them. I went into the film with little prior knowledge of Virginia Woolf, and with her, as with all three protagonists, I didn't really understand the reasons for their respective breakdowns.
Furthermore, what was the purpose of people like Jeff Daniels character? To witness Merryl Streep's breakdown? And Sally- How did she feel about Streep caring more about Richard than her?Similarly, Julianne Moore's husband's character was underdeveloped.I expected more.Skip The Hours.

Having in mind the great cast and boosting off my own expectations, in the end, this all appeared to me like a total catastrophe. The beginning of the movie is promising, then you get to wait for 10, 20, 30 minutes for someone to develop a decent dialog, or to see a decent scene that might drag back your attention. Nothing like that happens during the whole movie. I generally thought the problem with this film comes from the absurd script. There's no script. Dialog is scarce, fragile and meaningless in some moments. A sophisticated dialog and a great cast definitely do not make a good film. And to be even more honest, the only actress who was worth some attention in this one was Nicole Kidman - her character was the strongest. I am really not fond of artificial scenes, but there were plenty in the movie. What's with eating the pen? What's with the perfectly made cake that accidentally disappears for God knows what reason.

The Cinematography is wonderful and adds a nice tone to this very dark and beautiful piece of art. Directing is very well done and the movie flows so beautifully while switching between the three characters stories. Writing is tops as the story is so well composed and clever. Although very gloomy the movie should not be avoided because of it's darker material. Philip Glass' music drives the movie forward. It is the best original score in a movie this year edging out my second pick Road to Perdition. I don't wish to give away anything about this movie (hence the short review), it is the best movie all year.

The fine actresses did well with what little they had but the internal monologues from the book did not translate well into screen dialogue, and the pedantic, paper thin faux-feminism weighted the story down as much as those stones in Virginia Woolf's pockets. Also, I laughed out loud at a few of the scenes with Ed Harris talking about his writing, and I thought the score was intrusive. I understand a great deal of talent and effort went into this film, but the result is pretentious and annoying. I'm amazed at how many people don't notice how bad the script is. For a good movie on writers and writing see ""Wonder Boys."" For a good movie on suicide see ""Ordinary People."" For a good movie upper middle class female oppression see ""Far From Heaven."" This movie sadly tries to do all and fails.",The Hours
327,rodmans545,Provocative and Hopeful,10,15 April 2003,"Boasting an exemplary cast, purposeful direction, authentic production values, and a haunting musical score, The Hours is a sincere praiseworthy attempt to adapt Michael Cunningham's prize-winning novel to the screen. It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.The complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child. And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.
Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any 'real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that 'one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.The Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.However it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.But if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.",The Hours
328,selvedays,Powerful and Haunting.,10,26 March 2003,"Based on Michael Cunningham novel, The Hours is a true tour the force that really deserved more attention than it received at the Academy Awards. The movie is a sophisticated and soul searching look into the lives of three women who lives in three different moments in time but share in the same pursuit of acceptance, self discovery, and fantasy that is beautiful, and at the same time self destructive as well. The script written David Hare weaves together the struggles of these characters in a way that really brings each of their stories into focus and makes the final moment almost as powerful as the first. Nicole Kidman earn Her Oscar in spades with her gut wrenching performance of Virginia Woolf, and Julianne Moore is just as great as the lonely housewife who daydreams about the life she years for. Meryl Streep rounds out this exceptional cast as a woman trying to give some support and dignity to a friend dying of Aids, who is played By the ever great Ed Harris. This film is a truly powerful and haunting piece of movie making, and it will not only hit you close to home with some of it's issues, but will at the same time give an up lifting feeling that will stay with you right after you see it.Grade: A, (I wise I can go higher.)",The Hours
329,pieintheface,A Treasure that didn't get the credit it deserved,10,26 May 2003,"The Hours was a truly amazing movie. At first I was skeptical about how a movie about three unrelated women dealing with depression could translate into a moving story. In ways, this film adaptation was even more captivating than the words written by Pulitzer-prize winner Michael Cunningham. Hare, the screenwriter for the Hours, took the novel by Cunningham as a pretty strong foundation. The movie pretty much stays true to the novel (which is a pleasant surprise in film nowadays). Not only that, but Hare adds elements to the stories of Laura Brown and Virginia Woolf that blend seamlessly into the core that was already there.The movie contains performances by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman that are absolutely stunning to watch. It is amazing how well these three actresses fit together into an ensemble piece without even appearing on set at the same time! Each complements the others in both talent and grace. Especially when the emotions penned by Cunningham were long assumed to be inadaptable for film, it was astonishing to see how well Moore and Kidman, especially, captured their own nuances in the portrayal of depression. The train station scene with Kidman will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the most profound scenes of Hollywood- a career-defining moment for Kidman certainly.One of the most remarkable aspects of the movie was that it could have so easily fallen apart yet it remained solid. I reward Phillip Glass' mesmerizing score and the film editing department for this accomplishment. Glass' score, although minimalistic, was just the thing needed to tie the story together. Its steady rhythm resembling the ticking of a clock and at the same time a gurgling river was perfect in keeping flow for the movie. How he was beat out by Eliot Goldenthaal's score for Frida will always remain a mystery to me. Although I do not think The Hours was the best picture of 2002, I feel it should have gotten more consideration and a couple more wins than the sole accolade for Kidman.",The Hours
330,ChadEHarris,Excellent,10,29 April 2004,"The Hours is an extraordinary film. To many, the movies are a way to gain perspective about life, to identify with characters...to find a way relate it to your own personal situations and examine it's issues to broaden your own mind. For people who look for this in movies, The Hours is an experience never to be forgotten. It contains normal people in normal lives with normal problems. They deal with problems most people deal with on a daily basis. It is a movie about the human condition...a condition that is far from perfect. Most people try put up a facade so others will think everything is fine...but it rarely is. Every day, people struggle to balance their lives between managing their problems and insecurities, while trying to portray a certain image to those around them. The person who is actually able to be honest with himself/herself and refrain from avoiding his or her problems is the one who is the happiest. The Hours helps us examine our lives and to see if we are truly living, or if we are simply spending all of our time avoiding those things that make us uncomfortable. Each character has a different ending, which occur when they have no other choice. For Clarissa, the events that happen around her force her to really think about the way she is living her life and encourages her to change it.The acting in this movie is absolutely superb, and the casting could not have been any better. The film is honest and true and reflects the human condition through single day. Virgina Woolf was right about how you can recognize a person's life in a single day. What happens in that day shows their situation, their struggles, and the choices they are forced to make.",The Hours
331,tbdahmen,A woman's life in a single day.,7,22 September 2012,"I saw this film for the first time when I was fifteen and beginning to discover my own feminism.Nicole Kidman plays Virginia Woolf writing her famous novel Mrs Dalloway, Julienne Moore is Laura Brown, a 1950 s housewife reading Mrs Dalloway and Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughan, a modern-day version of Mrs Dalloway. These three women, in their separate timelines, affect each other's day as they grapple with the threat of suicide (in one form or another) and the ghosts of their past.One moment in particular that makes my heart ache every time I watch it is when Clarissa (Streep) is preparing the ""crab thing"" for a party for her writer friend Richard (who is battling AIDS). Streep has a wonderful way of using her body language to express more than words ever could. Clarissa stands over the sink and tries to hold back tears. In that moment, we know all that she has lost, all that she yearns for, all that she regrets all that she has laboured and all that she can never change.In case you are wondering, I don t think it is necessary to read Mrs Dalloway or the novel The Hours before watching this movie. Although I strongly recommend an attempt on these masterpieces of literature, this film is a beauty on its own.Stand outs: Despite being a male character in a female-centred film, Richard (Ed Harris) is a linchpin in this story. Harris manages to balance stubborn martyrdom and crippled pride. Toni Collette also delivers a powerhouse scene as Laura's neighbour Kitty. Overall, stellar performances from the entire cast.",The Hours
332,PulpFiction1987,The Best Film In The Last Five Years **** out of ****,10,13 August 2004,"The Hour is one of the best films ever made. It is perfect in every way shape and form. The directorial style takes you in awe. There is not a single moment of the film that lets you stray from it. The performances are all flawless especially Nicole Kidman's who very deservingly won the Oscar for best actress. There is nothing that you cant talk about when it comes to this film because there is nothing that is not worth mentioning. The cinematography, score, editing, dialog, and cotume design are all absolutly flawless. But what this film has above all is a message. This films meaning can be elaborated on for hours thus the title becomes The Hours. This film is about those little moments that create complete lives and that must never be taken for granted. Each story is set in differnt times and some may say it just makes it more interesting but the reason I believe it is, is because it shows that people have been going through the same hardships forever and its never going to stop unless society learns to except the differnences in all people. This film will be remembered for years to come and for me it will last forever.",The Hours
333,snuggi788,The Hours needed more hours nonetheless a fabulous movie,9,7 November 2018,"Each time you watch this movie you discover new details that enrich the experience. Everything is carefully crafted, stellar performances from everyone included the small supporting roles, the maid was great is her brief moments. Leonard is subtle and great as the worried and supportive husband of Virginia. The train station scene was so powerful that it probably landed Nicole her well deserved oscar. She encapsulated the internal struggle, the demons, the sorrow, the faint joy, everything she felt we felt too. The prosthetic nose was just that, a nose, she gave life to her character and would've been just as amazing without it.
Julianne Moore shines equally as the frustrated, depressed and eager to please everyone wife. The way she conveys complex emotions is outstanding. When she's so obsessed with making the perfect cake our hearts break for her, when she's walking away from Richie screaming in the background we're as devastated as her, when she's sobbing for Kitty and talking with her husband we're equally stunned. Julianne gives it her all here, in silent scenes her expressional face tells a story you feel you know her. In my opinion that Oscar was hers.
The little boy was excellent too, you feel his anxiety, her worry and love for his mom who's struggling.
One thing bothered me, I feel some characters could've used more screen time, Lewis Walsh for instance, Kitty as well. Such a strong scene where he's consoling Clarissa, so much meaning in a small scene.
Now there's no way to review this than to mention the amazing Ed Harris. He was impressive, such a brilliant portrayal of a clever mind, a fragile but also a determined mind. We all say what was coming, it was inevitable but I also think he should've had some more screen time. None the less Richard left an impact and the chemistry between him and Clarissa is fantastic.
There's so much imagery and beautiful metaphors, the flowers, the bird funeral, ginger ( symbolizing longevity). 'Someone has to die so the rest of us should value life more', 'That's what people do they stay alive for each other'. There are so many great quotes, profound messages to learn from. I'd given it a 10 but all in all recommendable.
The hours makes your heart cry, your soul smile and your mind ponder. The music is very fitting the the overall mood. This is just one of those I keep returning to a few times a year. Everyone from the script, directing and to the music and the performances made this into a masterpiece.",The Hours

However, it is just outstanding how all the actors just disappear into their characters. They are no longer Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman. The script is no longer on paper. The film is no longer on a screen.I am not a big fan of Nicole Kidman's acting as I am of her film choices. I would be so bold as to say even in 2013 that she presents here in 'The Hours', her best acting role ever. Nicole Kidman was nowhere to be found and for 114 minutes, I was looking at Virginia Woolf. How she may have walked and talked and glared. I believed it. All this time I thought she just won the Academy Award because she put a fake nose on.

340,win200,Another movie designed to appeal to the audience's desire to feel literate,1,31 January 2003,"I'd first just like to make this clear: I'm not the typical movie-going yahoo who stood in line to see ""Jackass"" on opening weekend or drove ""XXX"" to a $100million+ box office take. No, my favorite films of the year included MichaelCacoyannis' sublime adaptation of Chekov's ""The Cherry Orchard,"" thebrilliantly scripted ""Igby Goes Down,"" and Phillip Noyce's shattering ""Rabbit- Proof Fence."" So now that I've established that I have semi-decent taste in film, I would like to offer that I think that ""The Hours"" is undoubtedly the WORST film I have seen in ages. The lead performances - Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep,Julianne Moore, and Ed Harris - are so poorly conceived and directed as to be embarrasing. There IS good acting in the film, but it's in the small roles - Toni Collette, Clair Danes, and Jeff Daniels. The scene early in the movie whenMeryl Streep goes to the florist is such a disaster of poor scripting and line directory that I was having to stifle laughter. And need we speak of Phillip Glass' score? I like Mr. Glass' music, but Stephen Daldry has inexplicably allowed him to use nothing but slight variations on the EXACT SAME THEME throughout the entire film. The volume of the music hasbeen mixed very high in comparison to the dialogue, and the result is that the music insufferably overpowers every damned scene it appears is, which isnearly every one. And the dialogue... what we have in this film is dialogue that works on theprinted page only. Novelists can get away  with using arch or unnaturaldialogue because we're not hearing it spoken and we can sort of compensate in our heads. However, when dialogue this ridiculous comes out of an actor'smouth it becomes pretentious and unbelievable. Does anyone actually believethat people TALK like this? Absolute silliness. Not to sound insulting to people who liked the movie, but this film is for people who haven't the patience or depth the read a novel of any substance and watch films like this in order to posture themselves as literate. I saw this film with a group of my college professors, and we all went out for coffee afterwards and had a right old time just ripping this film to shreds.

342,chellekat,Deeply moving and beautiful: I love this film!,10,28 June 2003,"I love this film and Nicole Kidman is my favourite actress (but I will try not to let any personal bias get in the way). For me, the film was an emotional journey during and after. It is a film to think and reflect on. Some people found this film 'depressing' or didn't like the music. I am the opposite. If you allow yourself to become emotionally involved with the characters and relate their three stories with your own life I hope you will see the film for what it is rather than dismiss it and be detached from it. I took so much away from this film, it made me appreciate life more, it made me want to live the best life I could.The Hours was a really magical experience, for me. I have read Cunningham's book since seeing this film in the cinema months ago and I would recommend it to anyone as it's a brilliant book and is so well written - Cunningham pours so much into this very short book, he is a truly talented author.I was so drawn into this film. I hardly realised that time had passed (funny that it should be called The Hours when I felt like that). I wasn't in a happy mood or a sad mood going in, just a normal sort of mood and although many aspects of the film made me sad I didn't feel sad afterward, it was good crying, some people don't understand the concept of a 'good cry' but it was a very moving experience from beginning to end, as some reviewers have noted.I loved the music. It seemed to compliment the movie so well and was just beautiful. At times, my eyes were welling up with tears or one was rolling down my cheek and I'd take a deep breath and the music would bring me back to the story again. I had read a few reviewers talking about the music being too loud or too much altogether but I couldn't disagree more. I thought once or twice, they think it's too much? Maybe it was just that the story is overwhelming in many ways, so many emotions that you experience and they thought they music was what was upsetting them? I don't know, I suppose we all think and feel so differently.Nicole deserved her Oscar so much, there is no doubt in my mind for me. From the first moment I saw Nicole in the river I recognised her - perhaps it's because I am such a fan of hers - but I was like, ahh there's my Nicole. Her eyes, they're so soulful. I wanted to see her more, but all through the film I wanted to know what the other characters were up to when another was on screen. The rest of the cast are perfect in their roles: Ed Harris is magnificent, Julianne Moore really has you feeling for her (and making sure you aren't judging her character) she is wonderful, Meryl Streep seems to fit into her role with ease, Toni Collette is gorgeous in her small part (I wish she had a bigger role), as is Claire Danes and Laura's little boy and Angelica/Sophie Wyburd - they are so talented for such young children.I feel so touched by this movie. I really do think it's about the struggle to live - to appreciate it for what it is, suffering and happiness. There are so many lines I love: ""you cannot find peace by avoiding life,"" and ""I wrestle alone in the dark, in the deep dark and that only I can know. Only I can understand my condition,"" and ""To look life in the face, always, to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is. At last to know it, to love it, for what it is, and then, to put it away. Leonard, always the years between us, always the years, always the love, always...the hours...""I love this film so much. It is very dear to my heart. If you feel you need to understand it better, read the book as well as it gives you a great insight into who they are, why they make their choices. This is a film (and book) that was deeply personal for me and has helped me through many troubled times. I think it deserves awards and praise so much and I think it's sad that some reviewers said it was made just for the purpose of winning Oscars. I do not agree. Besides, it was sadly overlooked at the Academy Awards, besides Nicole's Oscar.This review is so long but I just have so much to express and have so much to say about it.

All of the performances, including facial expressions and body language, even that of the child actor, were very believable and impressive.  Even the score was perfect.  I took the movie to a friends house last night and watched it again.  I'm going to watch it again today.

I have never seen so many great acting performances in a movie this bad.  Many movies attempt to evoke emotions that are not pleasant, and certainly entire genres exist with this goal in mind.  This film, however, is the first to personify boredom.  ""The hours"" I wasted watching this film creates a bad pun, but the joke is on me because I paid to see it.",The Hours
345,SamDash95,Usual feminist garbage,1,27 January 2003,"This was so awful, it's a shoo-in for Best Picture.  I haven't seen pretentious crap like this since American Beauty.  I had the same thought after that movie too.(Spoilers ahead)To hear Gloria Steinem tell it in her L.A. Times review, this is the greatest movie ever. From a twisted feminist perspective it might be. Virginia Woolf chooses suicide over a suffocating marriage.  The movie suggests the Victorian times did not allow her to live her true lesbian desires.  The fact of the matter is that Woolf was severely mentally ill. She was no heroine.  She was a very sick woman.Laura leaves her seemingly idyllic life, again, perhaps, for being stifled from her lesbian leanings.  She leaves her nice-guy husband and children, without explanation, to ""find herself.""  Though Steinem calls that a heroine, I believe a more apt description is cold-hearted bitch.  Sh*t, marriage is hard sometimes; we don't leave when we're feeling a little blue. Just try and imagine making a movie with a man abandoning his family and trying to put that in a positive light.And our third heroine, Clarissa, a -surprise!- lesbian is finally free when Richard commits suicide.  Men just get in women's way.Any wonder why someone like Gloria Steinem would love this feminist claptrap?  Absolute garbage.",The Hours

As for its 'depressing' aspects , I would prefer the terms 'real' and 'poignant'. It's not as slow as About Schmidt, nowhere near as depressing as All or Nothing or Sweet Sixteen.The acting is flawless , of course , (why no nomination for Streep ? ) and the cinematography is beautiful.Can't say too much about the film as despite its 'slow' image the film has several plot twists and changes of pace.Got to be worth a fiver from anyone who has sufficient interest in films to surf this site.",The Hours

However, the story did not keep my interest. From my understanding, it was about a woman writing a story and seeing the story and also seeing how someone else was reading that story. So there were 3 stories going on at once. I know that sounds very interesting. The problem is that all the confrontations were all internal for the main characters in all 3 stories. Without knowing what the main characters are thinking or why, it makes for a very boring film. I am going to guess that the book would be more entertaining than this.

Nicole Kidman gives a great peformance as virginia Woolf writing her novel Mrs Dalloway in the 20's. Then there is Meryl Streep living in contempory New York in the present day, living the life of the character Mrs Dalloway. My favourite character though is Laura Brown, played by the delightful Julianne Moore, (she should have won the oscar for this role) she is living as a 50's housewife reading the book Mrs Dalloway.We see these incredible women tackling life in each era, sometimes struggling to come to terms with what is happening to them and others around them. Ed Harris and Toni Collette also offer amazing peformances. There were some scenes in this movie that made me feel really emotional. I am of the opinion though that if a film can make you cry then it is a blessing, as you see your emotional side come through after watching a classic piece of great cinema.This movie is a must see for anyone who enjoys emotional and dramatic movies. 10/10.",The Hours

Nicole Kidman's Virginia Woolf was phenomenal, and her Oscar win was well worth it. Also, the film editing between the three decades was excellent and streamless as they move from story to story.Although the link between stories was minute it was done well and was not forced. Many people felt the movie was depressing, but in actuality I do not know how that could be true. Anyone knowing of Woolf's biography knows she commits suicide, so that should not be shocking but beyond that I think this is a film of hope and renaissance. See this film. This is my second favorite film of all time.",The Hours

The action was completely unbelievable and goalless - Virginia kissed her own sister in front of her niece (first cringe) so the lesbian thing can pass on to her I guess; then Laura Brown makes out with her friend while consoling her (huh?) right in front of her son, and the cheap line ""are you okay with that?"" and he grows up gay; after these, I was sure that Clarissa was going to start bumping donuts with her daughter Julia on the bed, but thank goodness no.  I disagree that these women were experiencing typical human problems.

353,BayAreaGuy77,"Star-Studded, Emotional Epic",10,8 February 2003,"Very few films strike a chord with me the way ""The Hours"" did. There is just something spectacular here with the way that the cinematography, music and casting all meshed. True, I am a sucker for old-fashioned, weepy ""chick flicks"". But what we have here is so much more. Emotionally-manipulative? Yes. Lush and glossy? Of course. Overly-sentimental? Definitely. But where the movie finds its own path is in the realism of its subjects. Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore gladly dive headfirst into their roles of depressed women struggling with constant ideas of mortality. Kidman sheds her glamour, for the famous prosthetic nose and drab, dreary duds. And Moore chooses to embrace a tired, greasy-haired look to portray a 1950's housewife unraveling. Meryl Streep is a little less dramatic and a little more kempt, but equally uneasy as the other two women. As amazing as the leads are, wh o really blew me away was Toni Collete as Moore's picture-perfect, nosy neighbor. Barely recognizable, she just lights up the screen. And that woman can do an American accent like no one.""The Hours"" uses a time-warp format, showing us the parellels between the lives of these three women who live in three different eras. The segue between times is flawless. Underlying all the drama is a spectacular score that is reminiscent of the Douglas Sirk movies of the 1950's. Each time a revelation takes place or an emotional breakthrough happens, on comes the movie's lush piano theme. In fact, the music is heard practically through the entire film. And it helps emphasize the struggle these three women are enduring.This is a stunningly gorgeous film that captures a day in the lives of these seemingly ordinary women, but takes viewers through a totally unordinary experience.",The Hours

Julianne Moore is terrific.  Her Best Supporting Actress nomination is legitimate -- her performance is what I based most of my enjoyment of this movie upon.  Kidman was solid, but does much better as a sex symbol than a suicidal author.  I was more impressed with her work in ""Eyes Wide Shut."" As a male viewer, I was genuinely not interested in the women all having lesbian tendancies.  It's not something I can really relate to.  In terms of a movie about suicide, this is a good one.  The window scene with Ed Harris was daring, but could have been better.  It wasn't worthy of the recognition over others, most notably Dennis Quaid in ""Far From Heaven"" but oh well. Streep, I felt, didn't alter much from Susan Orlean in ""Adaptation.""  I guess she must have done these two pictures around the same time...really didn't change her look or her affect for this one.  One thing to note, Philip Glass' music is phenomenal...he really does a good job bringing the movie together.  I think Daldry tried to dig a little deep here....the movie is cut very quickly...very confusing at times...but he somehow manages a nice twist at the end...See it if you must before the Awards, but you can save this one for a rental, especially if it takes home Oscar in March.",The Hours

The three outstanding actress(Nicole Kidman,Julianne Moore,Meryl Streep)brought ""the life"" alive. I think that the idea of bringing three lives into a unified whole is original and charming. However, it is pretty easy to confuse the audiences with the time switch in the film, but it turned out very clear. Director Stephen Daldry is great.  But the most important thing that I learned from The Hours is that Never Avoid Life by death, but rather live to avoid death.  Sometimes one should live the surface, not what underneath it, because the things underneath may sometimes ""kill"" you.

I also thought the book was only okay, so for the movie to do worse (I had hoped it would be better) is disappointing.The characters' complexities were not captured by the movie or by the acting: the best of the batch was definitely Julianne Moore, who did a fantastic job as usual.  I don't think Kidman deserved the Oscar for her role, although she is generally a prolific and diverse actress.  Meryl Streep, however, made an AWFUL Clarissa/ modern ""Mrs. Dalloway"".  I know she was trying to portray the almost naive simplicity of Clarissa's happiness, but seriously, Streep came off as insipid and wide-eyed.

The editing in this movie was magical it weaves the 3 stories together graciously. Julianne Moore was excellent as was Streep although i thought her performance was weaker than the other two. Seeing how 3 women from different generations can relate to each other through a book is great. My favourite scene is at the end with the old laura explaining why she had abandoned richard, *What is regret, when you have no choice. It was death and I chose Life"" is a line that really spoke to me. This is a movie that makes you think about your own life and it isn't a movie it is truly a FILM!.

This year I finally drew courage to read Cunningham's novel from which this movie was adapted. It is complex and relies on inner worlds and thoughts of three women. The movie has some very good points in bringing the novel to life, especially editing of different time periods, since it was not that easy to see exact parallels in the novel if they happen fifteen pages or more apart. I was seriously impressed by the acting of Nicole Kidman. I haven't seen her much, but I think this is her best role from what I've seen. I did not gave 10 stars because I doubt I would've understood those women's torment if I hadn't read the novel, because it is rather difficult to decode feelings and consciousness when there is not much to work with.

Look at this movie and I am sure that it will leave you thinking about a lot more things than you were the day before. Nicole Kidman is not my favorite actress; but she surprised me with a very good choice. Streep and Moore both give wonderful performances; but Kidman steals the show in this powerful performance. Even though I really loved this movie, I found Moore's character slightly annoying. She seemed to go to very different lengths to get where she needed to go, where Kidman and Streep went to different ones, but had a sort of connection. Ed Harris gives another wonderful performance and was again raped from the awards he deserved.",The Hours

The modern story in no way fit in with anything she ever wrote and the Mrs. Dalloway story occurred early in her career. Also at the time of her death she was nearly sixty years old. I also find the use of aids as a plot supplement to be so overused that it minimalizes the reality of aids. I watched the entire film and could see little reason for Nicole Kidman having won an Oscar. Wearing a prosthesis and appearing depressed,sad, unhappy, etc., etc, etc, does not take a wide range of skill.

Oh, the incredible acting. Nicole Kidman lost herself in Virginia Woolf. She wasn't Kidman playing the influential writer, she was the influential writer. She read Woolf, lived Woolf, and became Woolf to the point that you would not have ever known it was Kidman. Julianne Moore. Her name deserves to be in a sentence, alone. She brought it all together as the most tortured soul of the film. She made it seem so simple, so pure. You anguished with her, you were caught off guard by her, you felt for her. And the infamous Meryl Streep. She just wanted to plan the perfect party - Mrs. Dalloway. This film was full of small roles that had large meanings. The supporting cast was incredible and helped piece together why these women loved they way they did.This film made me feel like I had this little light inside of me. That we all have this light. And we forget sometimes to turn it on. We forget to live, to love, to laugh. These three women triumphed even when others thought they failed. These women all supported each other even though they were not aware of the other's existence. It is a story all about the surface, that magically forced me inside, that made me think about how these women came to be. What death and life mean and how different the answers can be from one person to the next. It is a film about the pains of life and how one survives the pain. The Hours, is a powerful story told by powerful actors. For me, the hours went by too fast. I enjoyed the world they invited me into, longing already to be part of it again.",The Hours

Enough to say it contains some really great acting and an amazing score by Philip Glass which is actually a stroke of genius such is the atmosphere it brings to the story.

369,EccentricCattle-2,"The Hours, and hours, and hours...",1,2 February 2003,"When first I saw the posters for the movie THE HOURS, I said that Nicole Kidman will be nominated for several awards on the basis of her accent and putting on a fake nose.  Sometimes it sucks to be right.The movie centers around three self-indulgent, spoiled, emotionally unstable women who sigh every three to four minutes while pondering suicide. Cheery, huh?  Why the movie was not called THE SIGHING, or HEY LOOK AT MY FAKE NOSE AND IGNORE MY BAD ACTING, or simply, JUST KILL YOURSELF ALREADY, I can only imagine had to do with the 13 hour plus running time.First, a note about the music.  The film is scored by minimalist composer, Phillip Glass.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy listening to the same three notes played over and over again on a synthesizer.  I find it relaxing, when at home, to put on a Phillip Glass CD and stare into the barrel of a loaded gun while pondering the meaninglessness of existence.    However, during the movie I kept wondering when one of the characters was going to say, open a closet door, and find Phillip Glass playing the organ and bludgeon him to death with her shoe.  Unfortunately, it never happened.  Instead these poor 3 women were forced to have every moment of their lives accompanied by the same relentless repetition of notes.  Frankly, I can't blame them for wanting to kill themselves.  Anything to make the music stop.The only way to have a scene between Merryl Streep and Richard Harris not work, would be to have a bad script.  Not just a bad script, but a truly awful, phony, wannabe-artsy, pseudo-intellectual, piece of pretentious Hollywood garbage.  The theme of the movie, I think, was `Sometimes people have to die in order that other people can appreciate their lives'.  The only reason I know that is that Nicole Kidman, I mean, Virginia Wolfe, said that.  Talk about pasted on.  THE PIANIST, on the other hand, illustrated its themes without ever having to come out and say them.  And Adrien Brody's nose is real.In summary, THE HOURS, is a story about 3 bourgeois women, living in different time-frames, who are in good health and have everything they could possibly want or need.  However, because `happiness' is impermanent and momentary, they become depressed and ruin it for everyone else.  This movie is clearly the work of a sadist.

At first I thought this was going to be a cool look at the inner feelings of mature women.  Instead character development was very superficial.  You are left to speculate on why the characters in the film are depressed and confused, to the extreme.Kidman just stares at the camera.. looking more crazed than depressed. She looked as if she shouldn't be trusted with sharp knives or young children.For me the most disturbing scene was the suicide with Streep watching.

There is little plot, there is no character development, and not one character has more depth than the thickness of the celluloid.   Oh, yes, all three women have serious problems with depression.  Did I miss any insights into this disorder that were in the film?  Or am I supposed to revel in the ""beautiful depiction"" of depression?  Sorry, but I'm not buying it.

373,BrutusCalavander,Some good moments,5,15 March 2003,"After sitting through what seemed like a 4 hour movie (my God, it's only 2???) I am left with very little to like about this movie. I find it distressing that the Academy is recognizing one of the weaker performances in the movie with the Kidman nomination. In her meatiest acting scene of the entire movie, with her film husband played by Stephen Dillane, all I could do was become annoyed. In this scene, Dillane does a splendid job using very subtle acting to demonstrate the emotional turmoil of having to deal with a highly unstable Virgina Woolf. However, contrasting with Dillane's yeoman work was Kidman, who seems only to be able to either grossly overact her emotional outbursts or play every other scene as still and lifeless as a statue.Julianne Moore does a much more capable job in her role, yet her nomination is not for this film. Of Meryl Streep I can only say that she did not seem to look comfortable at all in her role. I am a big fan of Streep, but all I could do was look on in disgust as Ed Harris stole all of the energy out of their scenes together.As for ""The Nose"", let's face it: Nicole Kidman does not at all resemble Woolf in this film, so why go through the ridiculous makeup effects?? I mean, by God, the woman is supposed to be nearly 60 at the time of her suicide and Kidman looks hardly older than her mid 30's. What happened? Did the makeup department have no grey hair and wrinkle makeup? Did it not occur to the filmakers to actually obtain a photograph of Woolf in her twilight years and work from that. It is obvious that they used Woolf's earlier Victorian era photos as a model for Kidman's makeup.Lastly, I am extra critical of a film that has such obvious Oscar grubbing motives as this one. This film was released in a smattering of theatres with only a few days left in the year to sneak into the awards. Even into February, it was difficult to locate a theater playing this movie. I say that if the filmaker actually was proud of this movie, he would care more about how the public received it than how many little naked gold men he got for it.",The Hours
374,gault69,This masterpiece will be wasted on the smug and complacent,10,8 November 2003,"An outstanding depiction of chronic depression, the deep insight it often engenders, and the devastating impact this phenomenon has on peoples' lives.The actors must have sensed ahead of time that this was going to be a truly great movie, and all of them completely threw themselves into their roles. The result is a level of acting brilliance rarely seen in cinema today.
Intertwining three story lines in a single movie must have represented a daunting challenge for the director. However, he pulls it off with complete aplomb, enabling us to become deeply absorbed in all three stories as they move, in tandem, inexorably toward their fateful outcomes.
Some on the IMDB board have criticized this movie for being nothing more than overindulgence in morose self-absorption. But, read their comments, and it becomes apparent that many of these critics are predisposed to angrily dismiss ALL life experiences they do not understand.

How about Woolf's meditations on war, gender, and violence in _Mrs. Dalloway_ and the facts (whatever one makes of them) that she was sexually molested as a child, that her suicide took place during another war, and that she and Leonard were on the Gestapo's hit list? Stripping away all the actual material facts of people's lives and times leaves all this relentless emphasis on their supposed ""feelings"" simply meaningless and manipulative. It's also extremely irritating to have the artist Vanessa Bell reduced to some fluttering mother hen looking with incomprehension at her dotty genius sister Virginia, and to have the real erotic memory at the core of _Mrs Dalloway_, the kiss with Sally, switched to a kiss with Richard, and Sally reduced to the dull spousal role that is Richard's in the novel. But even as a film taken on its own terms this was overdesigned and stupidly pretentious.",The Hours

Half way through the film there is still no hint on how these 3 women are linked. Conversations are long and deep and yet I felt like a spectator who does not know what is happening. The Virginia character was miserable and uninspiring and that ridiculous false nose Nicole Kidman was wearing meant I could not take the character seriously. As for Meryl Streep (an actress I usually admire) and her poet friend dying of AIDS - yes very interesting but who the hell are they and what are they to do with all this?

After seeing it I thought: 'Either I am a fool guy, either it is completely worthless!' Of course I'd say the second is the good one ;-). I searched in vain what I could miss an would explain all that noise around the movie. To be honest, I have one idea: the movie is cut for its actress. They have wonderful scenes to play and to show how good they are. And they are good, that is the problem. There is a real gap between the serious depress they live and the events they live. Maybe it is the goal of the director, but as for me it has a negative effect. To me they seem people who take pleasure in dark thinking.

I read the book but I love movie better than the book. Nicole Kidman is the best actress on all the time except Ingrid Bergman and Catharine Hepburn. I think her gaze to the bird is one of 10 top screens in cinema. Cinematography is excellent and the film music is very good. I think Film music influence on the movie screens is very much. I think Virginia Woolf self Slayer when she told to his husband Leonard:"" Leonard this is love between us every day, this is the hours ""make viewer sad.

Daldry has given ""The Hours"" a universal appeal by not deciding that question for us. It is up to the viewer to decide that and like all great films ""The Hours"" allows each viewer to decide differently, based upon their own perception and experience. Who do you live your life for? Laura Brown (Moore) on why she abandoned her children: ""What does it mean to regret when you have no choice? It's what you can bear. It was death and I chose life."" Virginia Woolf (Kidman) explaining why she's chosen to take her own life: ""To look life in the face, always to look life in the face and to know it for what it is, at last to know it, to love it for what it is and then to put it away ... always the years between us, always the years, always the love, always the hours.""

Three of them have very different attitude towards life. Miss Clarissa, the one 'seems' to be most positive towards life, or was she? The relationship she has been lingering for years should be long gone by the time she was preparing the party. However, even after so many years, she still doesn't have courage and determination to solve this problem. Two souls, the writer and she, have been suffering for years after years. She had always been avoiding this painful but inevitable problem. She was trying to escape. Spending time on the walking death seems to be vain but earning the compliment of kindness. For both of them, this is indeed escape. The problem still made the days of both of them agonizing, they just tried to hide that.Laura, who questioned the meaning of life and do not find the answer at last. But she escaped, leaving her child behind. This is a decision which affects the whole life of the child who become the writer later.Virginia, the author of Mrs. Dalloway, who commit suicide at last. the one of the three which seems to be most 'negative'. The voice in her head has tortured her for years. Her death was a relief for both the dead and the live. More importantly, the ultimate revenge to the devil in her head. Well, even she killed herself. She is the one and only one in the three who take the intuitive to solve the problem, the only one which really have the courage to face life.Three story interweave each others and affect each others. Just as Mrs. Woolf said, lives should affect each others, touch each others. We live for each others.The Hours, the moment of decision, which change our whole life.

The acting in the movie is excellent from the three leading ladies and also Ed Haris gives a superb supporting performance.The ending is really unpredictable while we see the plot of Mr Dalloway being evolved through these three women.This is by no doubt one of these year's best.",The Hours

This movie was striking in that it has no story. I found that there is no plot, no driving goal that all the characters strive towards. What all the characters, three women from different times, are all trying to do is to find themselves, and their results are is the message that the film is trying to project.For Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), she is a woman that loves life, but finds that she cannot live it the way she chooses. She is crippled by her own health, and has to exist in such a way where she is constantly unhappy. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) has everything that should make her happy, a doting husband, a little boy and another child on the way, yet she is unhappy, and she finds that her life is slowly killing her. As for Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), she is unhappy but she doesn't really realize it, or suppresses it so deep inside of her because she has to be strong and confident for the sake of her ex-lover, a man who's death is imminent. These are unhappy women, and in the mist of their unhappiness, they discover what life really represents, and what happiness is to them.
It was the message of the story I really loved. Happiness cannot be defined as a thing, it is simply a moment in time, a realization that indeed you are happy, content to just be there. Meryl Streep's revelation of her discovery of happiness to her daughter Julia (Clare Danes), was very touching. It was almost as if she is trying to pass her happiness onto her daughter. Life only exists when you wish to continue living, Laura never truly lives, she cannot find happiness. Richard (Ed Harris) no longer wishes to live, and although he has found happiness with Clarissa, it seems as if he has lost it, and can no longer derive joy from living.I suppose people will continue to chant on and on about how this movie was made to win awards. I would like to believe that movies in general are made to give an idea, or a picture of something to the audience. For most movies, it's of an alternate world, the impossible occurs and it's a fantasy being played out. In this movie, there is no fantasy, death and depression are all part of our society, as well as our longing and seeking for happiness and the purpose of life. If this movie wins awards, be it for best movie of the year, or worse movie of the year, it doesn't cause it to be any less profound on the audience.",The Hours

It's certainly a very well made movie, even though I don't think it can top ""Chicago"" in the Best Pic category.
Now, to respond to many of the posted comments charging this film with the crime of being boring:  Well, to some extent, I have to say it is.  The actual events that take place throughout the film are boring in some places. But I believe if you think it through and pay attention to the movie, that's exactly what the makers were trying to do.  After all, the book by Virginia, the book by Richard, and the movie itself are all reflections of each other.  One of the ongoing jokes in the movie is how everybody thinks Richard's novel is ""difficult"" and ""boring,"" and those are really clever, self-depricating jabs at the movie as well as its critics (I love Clarissa's conversation with Louis about the novel....a whole chapter on whether she wants to buy nail-polish...and after fifty pages, she decides not to buy it...hah!).  The whole point of the movie is that these three days in these three lives are seemingly as ordinary as any other, except it just so happens that the destiny of each character will be decided on these days....just like Mrs. Dallaway's!
As well made of a movie that it was, personally I can't swallow the movie's final message.  It seems to say that the only way to get through ""The Hours"" is just to buck up and make your own meaning in the face of life's absurdities.  As a Christian, I believe that life certainly is absurd, but there is meaning through it all because of God.  But despite my disagreement, I can't deny it's a well-done film.  8 out of 10.",The Hours
393,roaldsen18,A Showcase of all that is great in film,10,28 January 2003,"'The Hours' is one of those films. The films that every true movie lover experiences from time to time. It was a truly moving experience from beginning to end. The screenplay is unlike any other seemlessly weaving a tale of three women so tightly they flow as one. Nicole Kidman's performance is astonishing and in my opinion is the only true rival for Julianne Moore (Far From Heaven)at the Oscars. She has become one of the world's greatest actresses spreading her dramatic wings as Virginia Woolf. While one is aware that it is her onscreen it is hard to say ""is that really her"" can it be? Meryl Streep is a screen legend and adds another mesmerizing performance to her resume. This film solidifies the way I feel about Ms. Streep. She is such an amazing actress that it seems on screen that she is playing herself not acting (which I guess is the point) but she is Clarissa Vaughn. Julianne Moore deserves a double Oscar Nod this year for her slightly and I say that with care smaller role. She is as disturbing and touching as her two counterparts and scares me with how good she is getting. Ed Harris' patryael of a man ravaged by AIDS is what I believe his best performance to date.

396,mvwindsor,A very interesting and rewarding film !,10,17 March 2003,"The Hours is a very interesting and rewarding film that is more than worthy of anyone's attention and time.It flows by and should be accessible to everyone who's ready to be surprised ( in life and in general).  Anyone who likes films, reads and generally tries to see life thorough as many eyes as possible to shed light on your own experience  ( supposing imagination and empathy are part of you consciousness ) will find these 3 stories of a day deeply touching and insightful of others experiences thus these stories will open a view and hopefully will affect you regardless of gender of sexual orientation ( showing humanity and universality - which connects us all ).
Technically, the sheer craft of the film is evident in every scene helped by the precision judgments of the director / vigilant photography / shrewd editing and a revelatory score from Philip Glass. A score that is richly noticeable as a crucial unseen character in this ensemble, never merely underscoring but commenting and 'playing with' the other strands to enliven, contrast and comment on the visual.Acting colour this film across the board by performances that communicate emotions and ideas in differing ways and all the actresses/actors here keep the film-flow uninterrupted.  The only minor niggle for me was character of Louis - played by Jeff Daniels, who somehow belongs in a different movie as his interpretation is informed by excessive stereotyping resulting in an ugly mannered old-fashioned campy act, which is a small blemish in an otherwise perfect ensemble piece.
See this movie for its beauty , its insight into another's view its unique taste/feeling that it leaves you with ( don't go expecting something easy that asks nothing of you ) and you will take something you with - something that will last and hopefully help illuminate you own experience . I certainly underwent that.On a side note (and entirely worth ignoring / excluding from mind) are some of the surprisingly vitriolic comments to be found here. Slight annotations that cast a negative response on the film which don't seem to offer a valid critique but simplistically seem to be reacting to/shocked by the tone of this picture.The Hours does seem to develop a kind of realism of the 'atheistic viewpoint', take charge of your life with both hands, love it, live it and then leave it / put it away = the ultimate choice of self determinism and obviously tough to take for some here (the 'cushioned' perhaps )  .Furthermore , the negative comments / viewpoints here, judging by some of  the remarks so far, are also spurred in their revulsion by the films clear libertarian attitude to the multitude of life, ( lesbian / bi-sexual family units) and specifically the depiction of 'modern' relationships as diverse beyond the 'comfortable' old categories, which still seem attractive and safe to some .Consequently, the Hours is STILL too modern a piece of work for several reviewers here, and as someone grunted below, it is a 'sick' film. Considering that Virginia Wolf's strand takes place at the start of the 20th Century, things don't seem to have moved on too far in some corners of this earth, proving too much for some people for whatever reason still .",The Hours

405,chwor,The Hours,10,16 July 2003,"I know it may sound too exaggerated to many of you, but i have never been moved by another film so much as i was by ""the hours"". i don't know why but i couldn't get my head right and gather my thoughts for more than two hours after i saw it the first time. it is maybe useless to give arguments about what makes this film so special because to me here logic does not and probably will never make sense. i suppose the only valid argument is that it put me out of orbit and something from it will remain inside me as long as i live and that's what true masterpieces of art are able to achieve in people's hearts. much of the success comes from the fact that the book it is based on was not a thundering piece of literature (although it won the pulitzer, but that's my opinion - i found it a little bit colourless) and the film was not overshadowed by it and there weren't any expectations it was required to live up to. actually, the director and the screenwriter have not changed much of the book but they have added so much more - especially to conveying that debilitating sense of utter despair that manifests itself in every single second of these two hours. ""the hours"" of course is dealing mainly with death, this is plain enough to see. but the three different points of view represent three different paths to it, which converge at some moments only to diverge in the next, finally uniting in one stable entity. in this process a lot of analogies are used, a lot of allusions from one epoch to the next. it is not easy to make a movie of this kind look and sound coherent without running the risk to bore to death the audience. this never happens with ""the hours"". the linking unit obviously is the novel ""mrs dalloway"" virginia woolf is writing, which is mentioned in all three parts of the film and has an impact on the actions and characters of the protagonists. another obvious link are the three kisses, but in the same time they are a powerful tool of distinguishing the three heroines, of making the natural transitions through the epochs. there is something eerie and tear-envoking in these kisses (i will never agree with all those people who claimed they were sexual and lesbian, because this undercovers only the shallow understanding that such people got from this movie, i don't reckon this is even a topic that should be discussed). i regard them as an outer expression of the fact that all three ladies we have here in this film, are poets (or in the words of virginia - visionaries) in their own way and this makes them unable to fit into the world they're living in. someone somewhere had said that this is the true mark by which poets can be discerned. this applies in full most devastatingly to laura brown - and that's why her kiss has been put first, it is the starting point, the bottom of despair and self-hate, it is the edge of the abyss, or the end of the culle-de-sac, from which there is no road ahead, it is the confinement which she is doomed to endure all the seconds, hours, days and years of her sad life. julianne moore plays so well that every time the camera showed her face, expressing the claustrophobia of her tiny, concrete-walled world, my heart was breaking and breaking...but at the same time this kiss is the dawning of hope, although ironically it leads to laura's decision to kill herself and to her eventual further disappointment with herself over her inability to do it. but despite this failure of hers i am inclined to view her as a really strong woman because of the bravery she shows in facing herself in the moment of the kiss and for once doing ""what seems to be the best thing to do"". second is the kiss virginia gives to her sister. i think it is put second because it expresses a certain development from laura's timorous insurgence against her self-imposed imprisonment to virginia's desperate yearning for life. it shows the turbulent nature of the writer's character in its full sweep, shows that she is as hard as steel (in spite of all the voices she hears, in spite of her madness, of the feeble condition of her mind - that's the doctors' words, but, remember, she alone ""is the best judge of her own condition"" - although spoken a lot later in the development of the movie these words show that virginia knows what she wants, she is not afraid neither of herself, nor of the life, she constantly has to fight with and for). this kiss is presented in the context of showing virginia's longing for death, because it comes right after the scenes in the yard where she lies beside the dead bird, as if wishing to be in its place. after that comes the kiss, which is a startling contrast to the despondency we have seen previously - it also is a sign of how opposing to each other virginia's emotions can be. i sometimes even think that the notion of death and the faith of how close it can be, served as the great source of inspiration in her creative work. this kiss to vanessa comes to say - ""hey, you think you are the only one alive, i am more alive even than you!"" but at the same time it is a violent revolt against the isolation she has been put into by others, this is why she cries after that - once again being swept to the other pole of emotions - the line ""you think i may one day escape"" symbolizes this sudden but somewhat expected change, virginia realizing that she may never be strong enough to fight off her family and go back to london. virginia is a true poet - she is incessantly hurled from one side to the other by the devils that live inside her. i think one very important aspect of the film comes near to the end when virginia says ""someone should die in order that the rest of us should value life more"". it is the key to why virginia goes on living in 1923, although shown to us in the stages of her life, when she is most troubled and the idea of a suicide is already formed in her mind. there is no one at this time in her life who is ready to value life more if she were to die, and maybe when she kisses vanessa, subconsciously she is asking her - ""what is going to happen with you, if i died?"", but she does not receive the comforting answer, and she HAS to go on living and fighting, and actually the same day she gets her big win, convincing leonard to return to london. in this light comes the third kiss. it is not really of the same kind as the first two, they are more connected to each other through that thread of despair, actually this is the kiss of hope, of new life after the death. all through the film we have witnessed the conversations between claissa and richard and his constant talking that it is his time to die has prepared us that he IS actually the one visionary who will commit suicide in this movie. it is not a surprise and he knows he is going to do it - early in the first conversation with clarissa he tells her: ""wait till i die, and you will have to think about yourself"". this is a paraphrase of virginia's words in the end of the movie about valuing life more. the visionary richard dies because the person who loves him is ready to start valuing life more after his death, and clarissa shows that when kissing sally. given all the black thoughts this movie provokes even this can be seen as some kinf of happyend:), not that it is necessary to have one.",The Hours

408,Julia_Davis,Simply Stunning... (Plot Spoilers),10,15 November 2003,"I went in to ""The Hours"" expecting to be disapointed, I honestly couldn't see how anybody could adapt oneof may all time favorite books into a film without losing some or all of the emotional richness that makes the book so brilliant. Two hours later I came out of the movie theater stunned by what David Hare and Stephen Daldry had achieved in bringing the book to life, Hare had trimmed down the novel, losing some plots but never losing any of the emotional punch the book has and Stephen Daldry elictied career defining performances from the two greatest actresses working today, Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore and also did a great job with Nicole Kidman whose perfomance I'm slightly less impressed by. Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep BECAME their characters, I felt I wasn't watching Moore and Streep play Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughn respectivly, I felt I was watching Clarissa and Laura, the chracters I had imagined time and time again while reading the book, Nicole Kidman sadly didn't quite have the same effect although I feel that if so much media attention hadn't been focused on her ""transformation"" into Virgina Woolf I may have found it easier to feel the same way about her performance  as  I do  Streep and Moore's. The supporting cast including Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Ed Harris, Jeff Daniels, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette and John C. Rielly all shine in their limited roles as well.""The Hours"" opens in 1942 England where Virgina Woolf (Kidman) exits her house, walks out of her garden, down to a  river, weighs herself down with stones and walks into the river, drowning herself. The film then transfers to 2001 NYC where Clarissa Vaughn is going out to buy flowers for a party sheis holdiing, then back to 1923 England where Virgina Woolf is struggling to write the first lines of her book ""Mrs. Dalloway""  and Laura Brown wakes up in 1952 Los Angeles, torn between picking up her copy of ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and escaping into it's world or going and  helping fix her son breakfast.As their respective days progress Clarissa visits her friend Richard who is dying from AIDS and is mentally unstable because of the diseases effect on his brain, Richard whom calls Clarissa Mrs. Dalloway is the person Clarissa is throwing the party for, he has won a prize for his poetry, she must face the fact that she is losing the man she loves, who  never loved her back, both Clarissa and Richard are gay,  but had in their youth had an affiar and Clarissa has never been able to find love  like that she has had with Richard. Laura struggles to live out a normal day, feeling trapped by her surroundings and her life, she wants to be the perfect wife and mother but finds herself overwhelmed by the simple task of baking a cake and  after an experience with a female neighbour who is ill and in need of comfort during in which she kisses her, she finds herself leaving her young son Richie with a neighbour and going to a hotel room to escape, taking a jar of sleeping pills with her, because the simple task of living has her contemplating suicide. Virgina meanwhile is struggling with her recovery from a period of depression and trying to write a book under the watchful eye of her husband Leonard. She  feels trapped in the  small town of Richmond and longs for the excitement of London,  she feels left out of life, especially after a visit from her sister and decides to go to London but gets no further than the train station before her husband catches up with her. Laura and Clarissa's stories colide into to each other but I'm not giving away how. ""The Hours"" is a brilliant film that deals with the themes of love, loss, life, sanity, madness, sexuality and above all survival, I think Ricard summed up the whole film perfectly with one simple quote: ""But I still have to face the hours, don't I? I mean, the hours after the party, and the hours after that..."" 10/10",The Hours

That in itself says something about the film. Although I have always liked drama and character analysis, I found the ""The Hours"" to be excruciatingly melodramatic. Yes, the film has nice cinematography and superb acting...but for what? In the end, I didn't feel entertained or enlightened. The most profound suggestion in the film is that Richard's homosexuality is psychological, not biological (at least that's how I interpreted it). This, along with Harris' performance, are the two elements of the film that sparked my interest. The rest held my attention, but only due to curiosity.The end result was not satisfying.I think Nicole Kidman is an excellent actress but I would have much rather seen her awarded for her work in ""The Others"" or ""Moulin Rouge"" than this.",The Hours

I disliked the film and the book for the same causes. They are both written to please those people who consider themselves sensitive and deep in mind, and not always are. I personally don't need and don't like a so explicit way of putting down feelings and artistic devices. That's to say the authors are expert in using their instrument, but I don't like this way of doing literature and movies. For example, the director's attitude to let the music play louder at those moment he expects you to be moved by the images.

414,sashajunkmail,A masterpiece - if you have the strength and patience,9,9 December 2004,"I love this movie, it is easily my favourite movie of the last 5 years.Many recent reviewers clearly hated the film. They wanted it to *mean* something. They wanted to be uplifted. They wanted the standard (and trite ) ""just push on through and life will be dandy""-message. They wanted a neat, tidy, and above all happy, ending.No doubt these same reviewers would quite like Shakespeare if only he wasn't so damn depressing.One thing I know, none of them has actually read Mrs Dalloway, and they sure wouldn't have liked it if they tried.This movie is undeniably dark. It looks unflinchingly at depression, suicide, triviality, futility and despair. It forces us to address that mother of questions ""Why do we bother?"". And you know what? It doesn't even finish with a golly-gee formula to make it all better. What is Hollywood coming too? So what makes this movie? Well everything really. The screenplay is terrific; subtle, literate, massively multi-layered and cuttingly honest. The acting is damn near flawless - Kidman is stunning and Moore is even better.

Yesthe hours, life itself needs meaning to survive, needs time to heal and love to grow. I believe that this is the essence of this wonderful movie that makes me reconsider judging people by what they seem, by the category they would fit into, but try to find the good in everyone and that thing which makes that person special. Friendship, love, disappointment, regret, unhappinessthe barometers by which we perceive ourselves throughout our existence are excellently portrayed in this drama through the characters' attempt to make peace with the decisions they made in their lives, to accept death as the natural course, to try their best at succeeding, but accept failure nonetheless, and finally, to appreciate the people that surround them for what they are. So I would recommend this movie to anyone who's ever experienced loss, who's ever questioned his life, who's ever felt disconnected from the world or trappedsit back, open your mind (and heart), enjoy the wonderful performances, the amazing portrayals, the stunning display of emotion and cherish life as it is.",The Hours

420,Spania,An interesting revision on Woolf's life,8,3 November 2018,"""The hours"" is a drama based upon British writer Virginia Woolf's life and how her novel ""Mrs Dalloway"" (1925) leads to a tourning point in the lives of two women in the 1950s and the 2000s.The film begins with Woolf's suicide towards the end of World War II, when, sick and tired of having to struggle constantly with frail mental health, childhood traumas and a difficult relationship with her husband, she lets herself drown in a river near her house. About a decade later, a depressed pregnant American housewife trapped in an unhappy marriage tries to cope with everyday problems and fins solace in reading Woolf's novel, with whose protagonist she can identify. However, far from helping her, the weird book contributes to destabilise her, and, after a brief sexual encounter with a female neighbour, she realises she needs to follow the steps of her role model and break free. Almost half a century later, a successful businesswoman from New York is planning to throw a party for an old friend and ex-lover, a writer ill with AIDS who has just won an acclaimed book prize. In spite of all her efforts, things will not run smoothly and tragedy will quickly erupt into her life.One of the main strengths of this film is the magnificent performances given by the three main actresses: Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep. Streep's old-school talent and Moore's psychological insight into her character will not come as a surprise to many, given their previous critically acclaimed works. Nonetheless, it is Kidman's powerful and surprisingly moving performance that constitutes the main asset of the film. Even if not bearing a physical ressemblance to the real Woolf, Kidman manages to come out of her comfort zone and offers a credible personification of the tragic writer, which deservedly got her the Academy Award for Best Actress.Finally, we must acknowledge other minor, albeit good aspects of the film. The trio's achievements were backed by the supporting characters' work and the compelling soundtrack, which enhances many of the film's capital scenes.",The Hours

It combines every ""ingredient"" needed to make an absolutely stunning outcome! The plot is outstanding to begin with, the way the story is unfolding is really interesting. It gives a strong feeling of how her life was and what she had in mind. Not to mention how great the acting is and, in terms of direction, I have nothing bad to mention. On the contrary! Everything meant to be just perfect. It leaves you with questions about Virginia Woolf's life, mixed feelings and perhaps makes you wonder how intriguing her writing was. I really loved its music theme too. One of my favorite soundtracks ever written for a movie, leaving exactly the same feeling as the whole movie does. Emotions are floating in the air.",The Hours
422,xorepsete,Beyond expectations,10,12 December 2005,"What a piece of work!! I ran accidentally into this movie...and it became my favorite. Of course, you don't get to see Moore, Streep and Kidman acting so often together so you should enjoy the movie for this reason first. Then..well there are so many details to learn from in this ""chef d'oeuvre"" .Where should I begin from? Woolf's life is in each one of the three caracthers.Let's begin with Moore for instance: in the movie, she's an awful mother, madly in love with a friend of hers, she neglects her own son and her behavior's repercussions are later terribly borne by her son- who, by the way, became a great writer, misunderstood and...sick - sick of the world around him and suffering from AIDS. It's always a reason for which we are who we are and we become who we become. And it's disastrous for a mother not to understand her son's pain even when his story -untold and cruel story- lies in a book, incomprehensible by ""common people"". In the end,Laura (Moore) realizes her mistakes, but it is too late for her because her son dies alone, unable to bear the illness and ""The Hours""..after the party. Streep(Clarissa) does a great job. She loves to take care of her best friend Richard ( Ed Harris), she enjoys going to his place , being always there for him, seeing her life through his eyes. But she loses, she can not be brave anymore, she gives up the feeling of special friendship between the two of them , when he kills himself. Then she takes refuge into her girlfriend's arms accepting that that compassion can be physical sometimes..those feelings of inner hate and untouchable personality can be defeated by a kiss from the one you love and live for. All these events happen on the background of Woolf's life. Kidman (Virginia) suffers a lot: there is no more love left for her, the walls are closing in and her story remains untold. She wrestles "" alone , in the dark"" and the only light is the one from her cigarettes. Virginia invented lives, dramas and destinies, invented and reinvented her life in her work. She drowns into life as Laura (Moore) drowns into Woolf's obsession . And while Laura escapes the passion of misleading life, Virginia embraces the predicted supreme silent moment of death. And there are no exequies , but silence for her. The glaring sun sets upon her life,leaving her ""oeuvre"" undying. She is ""l'auteur"" - and not ""the author"" - of everyone's destiny who believe that facts happen for a reason. At the end of ""The Hours"", the feeling of uselessness seems irrepressible, the story giving us the very meaning of life. Always the hours between us...and the others.",The Hours
423,Mr_Baxter,A powerful film perfect in every way,10,25 August 2006,"The Hours follows the lives of three women in three different periods in time. The novelist Virginia Woolf in 1923 as she writes ""Mrs. Dalloway"", Laura Brown, a typical '50's housewife' in L.A. in 1951, and Clarissa Vaughan, a publisher living in 2001 New York. The movie follows one day in these three women as they deal with the life-and-death situations they face.For starters, the film is technically well-made. Daldry superbly strings the three seemingly separate story lines along the films 114 minutes with perfect pacing and structure. The film is riddled with parallels between the three worlds, sometimes as small as an egg breaking, or as big as a same-sex kiss. Daldry's masterful direction manages to keep us interested in the segment we are watching, but curious about the other two without being distracted. Each time period has it's own look, feel and color (the greens and browns of 1923 Richmond, the browns, oranges, and yellows of 1951 L.A., and 2001 NYC with it's grays and blues). The cinematography, art direction and costumes are superb.The writing of the film is phenomenal as well. A perfect adaptation of what most would consider an unadaptable book, Hare captures the tone of Cunningham's novels expertly and shows a great deal of understanding in terms of the three women. Through the outstanding writing of the film, we begin to question or own lives and the way we live them.The best aspect of the film, however, is the acting. Boasting three of the greatest leading female performances, as well as an outstanding supporting cast, the film's cast is top-notch. Dillane and Harris give two amazing performances as Leonard Woolf and an AIDs-stricken poet. Kidman gives a career best as the 20th century novelist Virginia Woolf. Sporting a fake nose that leads to Kidman being unrecognizable, Kidman captures the essence, fear, and sadness of Woolf. Streep is also wonderful as the modern- Mrs. Dalloway cracking under the pressure of taking care of a dying friend. The standout star of the film, however, is Julianne Moore as the 50s housewife. Not a single line, shot, or gesture by Moore is wasted in helping us understand the complex character of Laura Brown.The film pacts an emotional punch, all heightened by Philip Glass', maybe too present, score. The films is dark, depressing, and slow to some, and is not for everyone, but is truly a masterpiece in film-making.",The Hours

They alone would make the film worth watching but it is the extra added spice of husbands, sons, lovers and friends that round out the cast and fill in the deeper emotions in this film. Ed Harris should have won the Oscar for this one. He speaks sentences with just a few looks and gestures and is really the heart of the movie. This certainly not a happy movie but reality is not always happy. The overt displays of women kissing women may be upsetting to some. They are an odd, unsettling factor in the movie but speak of the depths of the love these women have for each other. Whether lover, neighbor, or sister these women have a deep desire to express their emotions openly. At the same time they have other relationships that have failed or our weak and they are plague with the memories of what could have been better. The Julieanne Moore character is especially distraught and fragile. Kidman, the Oscar winner here, is perhaps the most misunderstood character. I do not know the life of Virgina Woolf as well as I should and perhaps therein lies the confusion as to why she does the things she does.

All of that in a beautifully composed soundtrack and gorgeous cinematography. The acting was perfection and the costumes were great as well. The movie is about having the right to be able to choose your life and trying to find happiness. The film also shows how hard it is to be homosexual in three different places and times. Virginia Wolf's life was locked up with by men dominating women, similar to the way Laura Brown felt locked up in her 50s suburban home with her husband that was in charge. Clarissa was set in our modern day and involved issues with self acceptance as well. These insecure woman in the end are perfectly tied together and every scene unravels perfectly with sophisticated symbolism. It is a liberal point of view, but the film is made with the height of motion picture quality and so wonderfully directed that this feminist statement is universal. Virtually the film is about embracing life and appreciating the little time we have. AMAZING how it is made right after 9/11 and before the recession. Seems like the film is FOREVER IS CINEMATIC HISTORY. And in the end all I can say is GORGEOUS. Extremely well thought out, frame after frame. Very intelligent and clever. I never get tired of this movie, there is so much stupendous imagery. In a world that is generally dominated by men, this film is REVOLUTIONARY. Now a woman is free and able to be whoever she wants to be. Acceptance of diversity and open sexuality is slowly but surely going to become a more comfortable subject matter with the general public. I loved the concepts of this perfect film. To the force, and I rarely use this phrase, but to THE FORCE OF PERFECTION. I felt the emotion and the serge of BRILLIANCE. SEE IT, and LOVE IT.

432,mariagropman,Excellent actors,9,15 August 2006,"It is one of few films that has made it to my book shelf of films worth seeing again... For some reason I used to dislike Nicole Kidman as an actress, but after seeing her excellent performance in The Hours, I became a fan! All of the actors, such as Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore (not to forget an admired performer during my adolescent years - Claire Danes) make this film worth watching over and over again... The film is based upon a novel about women being influenced by a novel and it's writer - Virgina Woolf. Therefore, the plot - womens' lives being influenced during different time periods - displays how literature can affect people throughout time...And no - Nicole Kidman's ""Virginia Woolf-like"" nose does not take the focus of the performance... !",The Hours

Although the story may be interesting (for some), staying awake to witness it is a different matter. When watching this film, time seems to go into some sort of quantum loop, and never ends - perhaps it should be called 'the years'. It would be a challenge for anybody to watch the entire film without commenting on its state of extreme dullness. I have no idea how the film writer has come up with such a plot-line, that has the ability to bore the watcher to such an extent. I have seen some pretty bad films before, but this one is definitely my number one worst film of all time, and thats not a joke.Anyone that witnesses this film has my deepest condolences.",The Hours
437,joshuabess,better triple your Prozac dose,9,21 January 2003,"I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone, and therefore shouldn't be considered a spoiler, that this movie is severely depressing.  The ties that bind the three women from different places/times is the profound lack of happiness in any of their lives for most of the film.  What separates ""The Hours"" from other films like it (not many in number for sure) is that the characters, for the most part, aren't even engaged in a SEARCH for happiness.  Furthermore, in each case, the featured woman intimately involves at least one ""loved-one"" in her downward spiral of despair, to the point where the viewers heart not only goes out to Virginia, Laura, and Clarissa; but perhaps more so to the lovers and children who are also victims of, but do not understand, their torment.Be prepared to re-examine your life.",The Hours
438,stefan2,Utterly brilliant (some mild SPOILERS),10,19 October 2004,"This movie surely hit my nerve. I went to see it primarily because of Julianne Moore who has become an instant favourite for her personality and performance in ""Magnolia""; and I did not care too much about the hype (or, eventually, loathing) of people who suggested, or discouraged, to see ""The Hours"". All dialogue throughout the movie is incredible and seems to consist almost completely of memorable quotes. And it all makes sense. If I tried to find a flaw in this piece, all I could come up with is the fact that, on some viewings (of about a dozen so far), I got the impression that Nicole Kidman was over-acting a bit during the railway station scene, which even then still stands out as probably the best sequence in the whole movie; on other viewings that same scene worked perfectly. (In ""The Others"", although a fine film, Nicole's performance was much less convincing to me.) What moved me most about the film is how it dealt with the choices the characters had to make (or did not make), how they affected them, and how others around them were inevitably effected in consequence, some of them in tragic ways.***Spoilers***Think of Louis: ""The day I left Richard, I made my way across Europe on a train, and for the first time in years, I felt FREE."" And of course the choices of Laura; the first one she was unable to make, and her defining choice that she would later be incapable of regretting although it may have wrecked other lives. I suppose that many viewers who dislike the movie are put off by the seemingly ruthless, irresponsible, or irrational behaviour of these characters, and if you cannot connect to their dilemma, it may indeed be a tough piece to sit through. However, it is my belief (and I think I know) that there are personal situations that prove to be that much difficult to bear for a given personal condition that it will eventually crush you, unless you force yourself to break away at any cost. And cost was high indeed, not only for the person who actively made the choice. Watching this happen in a brilliant movie made me reflect on my own choices, that once made and others yet to make.",The Hours

The plot doesn't seem to go anywhere, something that is confirmed when it finally ends. I didn't get the purpose of the movie. What was it trying to say? Would it be that gay people existed before the 60's? No, we already knew this.

442,dawnyoungs,revealed something bitter and sweet about the human condition,9,3 March 2003,"I do not believe 'enjoying' or understanding this film has very much to do with intelligence, or even artistic pretense.  I am an artist myself, and have been considered quite intelligent, back in those school days when those things were measured and judged.  I do not think, however, that it was those qualities within me that were moved by this work.This work shows three women confronting the question 'What meaning or value is there in my life?'  These women are average, ordinary women struggling with the confinements of society, the limitlessness of dreams, and the shortcomings of our mortal reality.  They are facing questions that women face in every generation:  Do children give my life meaning? Does love? Does the work that I produce? They are each facing the possibility of death, even seeing death in someone else gives us a vision of our own mortality.These are not things I got out of this film because I'm smart and arty. I am not saying I saw them because I want to fit into some clique. I was moved by these things because I too have gone through those emotions, I too have wondered about the beginning of happiness, or chosen to face the chaos and ultimate failures of life rather than stifle myself in suburban mediocrity.The fact that the three stories were so flawlessly threaded together produced in me a feeling of being part of something universal. I might even say that it gave me a glimpse of god.  Perhaps that is too much to say.The 'thing' about the movie is that it saw and showed all the little things of life, and revealed all the large feelings those little things create in the minds and hearts of the human beings living them.The acting was subtle and true.  The dialogue was honest, and yet had touches of poetry to it.  The story was in the realm of magic realism. And I think the point was that life, this moment, and the real living of it, that is magical too.As to the pay off? There isn't A pay off.  There are many brilliant, truthful, beautiful moments.  That is how the movie unfurls itself.  That is how life unfurls itself too.  That is what the movie is trying to say. The message of the film is to live every moment, that is the way to experience the film as well.I know that I could go on and on about the film because there were so many moments that moved me.  I could list a multitude of scenes that each revealed something bitter and sweet about the human condition.Coming out of this film, I thought about the people who don't get it, who won't ever get it.  I thought they were damned lucky.  I believe that understanding this film means that you have been there, where those women go.I cannot even imagine what it is like not to have ever been there.  I can't even imagine.  I have tried to explain to those people who love me what these emotions are inside me, and it is so hard to find the words.  Here is a film that shows me myself.  Here is a film that made tangible the feelings I struggle with.It may not please everyone, but this film reveals something that does live deep in the soul of many people, and I think that is an amazing feat.",The Hours

The others thought it was OK, but didn't quite understand or like the feel of it the way I did.I found myself not being able to get this film out of my head, and since I live far from my parents now, I rented the film in 2005 as I was dying to watch it again. I was once again mesmerized and watched every extra on the DVD. It was aired on TV tonight so I watched it a third time and it was compelling as ever.I agree with other people saying this film is not for everyone. You need to be able to understand the characters' feelings of longing and displacement and register all the subtle clues and details throughout the film.Nicole Kidman is perfect as Virginia Wolf, one hardly recognizes her with the false nose, Julianne More manages to look so fragile but determined at the same time and Meryl Streep, one of my favorite actors of all time is great as usual as the woman who bottles up her feelings.The technique and pacing when it comes to weaving together the three women's stories is unique and perfectly done and the score helps to build up a certain tension, one is just waiting for something to burst or go wrong.

444,MCrulzLiron,Best Movie of 2002.,10,1 January 2003,"""The Hours"" was the first movie I've seen in 2003. I'm easily going to name it as the best movie of 2002 and something tells me that in 12 months time, I will be saying it's one of the best movies of 2003 as well.Based on a Michael Cunningham novel, ""The Hours"" combines a real life story (Virginia Woolf), a re-written one (Laura Brown's interpretation of ""Mrs. Dalloway"") and an original creation as well (Clarissa Vaughn).We get three different stories, each fascinating on its own edited together into a complex, intriguing drama that will have you in tears a couple of times before the ending credits start rolling.What glues the stories together is ""Mrs. Dalloway"" - the book. Virginia Woolf, a suicidal author in England (1923) creates the character, the novel inspires a lonely housewife in Los Angeles (1951) and a 'trivial' 2001 New York City gay woman is called ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her dying friend who points out the similarities between them. Later on, we find out another connection between the characters.It's clear that the thoughts that have been put into this movie go beyond the screenplay and acting. Things like the settings & clothing for each story help compile a perfect, believable plot.However, what really left me with awe was the PHENOMENAL acting.Nicole Kidman (with the word ""Oscar"" stamped on her forehead) delivers a performance of a lifetime playing a rather difficult role while disguising everything that is usually so associated with her. With a fake nose, a cold, dark and distant attitude and above all a rough change to her voice, Kidman portrays Mrs. Woolf exactly as the writers wanted us to grasp her and manages to be the most outstanding of the three despite getting the least screen time. Absolutely amazing.Meryl Streep (C. Vaughn, 2001) and Julianne Moore (L. Brown, 1951) give impressive lead performances themselves with memorable emotional scenes. Cameo appearances by Ed Harris, Claire Danse, John C. Riley, Alison Janney & Toni Collette all support this exquisite masterpiece.MUST SEE. 10/10",The Hours

The program for the day is the evolution of psychosis from its early clinical appreciation to the modern more formidable challenge of AIDS dementia. The horrific effects of neurotransmission inbalance (key to schizoid thought disruption) on an artist's creative activity which culminate in suicide is  presented as self-destructive apotheosis of the crearive genius, an old wives tale. The similarities in demented behavior do not stop here. The movie clearly presents the obfuscation of sexual identity in schizophrenics. The script fails to consistently distinguish this ambiguity  as clearly schizoid or purely normal sexual homosexuality. However an eutopic camaraderie is shown between female and male homosexuality seldom observed in western civilization(Is this nostalgia for the Old Bloomsbury coed club?).

448,erothman,Kidman's Performance - Nothing Less Than Extraordinary,10,20 January 2003,"Watched the Golden Globes last night. I never have in the past, at least not in recent memory. But I wanted to see Nicole Kidman collect her award. I just had a feeling. Recently, I saw The Hours, a work of art; Kidman's performance haunted me through the night. Extraordinary.
Today I'm reading reviews. It amazes me how so many many don't get get it. But then we're in a different age, a more liberal time, where woman today have greater freedom. So I must be reading reviews written by those in their early 20s. That would explain why they don't get get it.The music by Philip Glass underscores the repetitive themes throughout the story. This story actually exalts repetitiveness - it's the foundation, the structure, the theme of the story. A very artsy idea.Does it work? I think it does. I think that's why Cunningham won the Pulitzer for the novel. But there's room here for criticism, for a valid critique. Is repetition enough?That is a question without any black-and-white answer.
(Though I know how an artist would respond.)The film, in my opinion, is more powerful than the book, because of the performances by Kidman, Moore and Streep, and because of the ability of film to clearly delineate the repetitive motifs. To read the book, to trace its themes, requires intelligence and memory, and several close reads. The film only takes one viewing. The themes are right there, brought to life with a hammer and anvil.",The Hours

450,imdb-21793,A towering monument to the culture eras,10,12 May 2009,"The Hours is a towering film that stands as a signpost marking the end of the postmodern era. Its message is one of hope for a new dawn, and the importance of literature as the thread that binds the great eras of culture together.The three women portrayed are icons representing the eras they inhabit. Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf represents the modern era; she is in the process of writing her masterpiece Mrs. Dalloway. (Mrs Dalloway concerns the activities of a high society woman planning a party and is the quintessential modern era novel.) It is a scathing indictment of the British class system of the Victorian era and deals heavily in the wars and destruction it terminated in and their effect on the populace.Julianna Moore as Laura Brown represents the early postmodern era, living in 1950s suburban splendor; she is in the process of reading Mrs Dalloway, and in doing so questions the validity of the status system of her own time.Meryl Streep plays a late postmodern era woman who is planning a party; she is apparently living the life of Mrs Dalloway in ignorant bliss. She is a benefactor to Richard Brown, an aids addled poet and author slated for a lifetime achievement award. The party is in his honor.The film switches between the three plots and defies the normal structures of heroes and villains, beginnings and endings. Instead it deals with the same large ideas as Woolf's novels, themes of sickness, of the irrevocable march of time, of beauty and embarrassments of riches, of death, and of sexual ambiguity and guilt.The thread that ties the movie together is Literature. It is critically important to all of the characters, even when they don't realize it. Everyone reads Richard's dense novel and rolls their eyes in its reminiscence. They all admit it's important, yet they don't understand why. Even Richard says ""I don't know why I bother"".It is revealed when we discover that Richard was abandoned by his mother as a child, and learn her identity. Born in the previous era, she was suicidal as a postmodern suburban housewife and abandoned both her children. ""They say it's the worst thing you can do"". She hops a bus for Canada and gets a job... Where? In a library of course, where she ""read everything he wrote"".And so Richard's art is in fact a lifeline between the ill fated author and his long lost mother. It is the postmodern as the (not quite) abandoned child of modernity. When his mother reappears in the tragic conclusion, she is repugnant to the postmodern Clarissa. But Clair Danes, playing Clarissa's daughter, gives her a hug. She sees the flaws of her mother's era, and has no grudge with the bygone era of Laura Brown.Danes personifies the dawn of the new contemporary era, and our hope for the future. The movie is faithful to Cunningham's Pulitzer prize winning book. It's a rare film for people who love to read books, and approaches the genius of Virginia Woolf herself. It's my favorite movie and I recommend it without hesitation.",The Hours

However, it was not as depressing and sad as it could have been and showed some less selfish ways out of depression and despair. But Virginia Wolf's suicide showed how selfish it is. Maybe it also offered some insight into depression but not a lot. The acting was fairly good, although the lesbianism was silly and wasteful subplot, even if true in Virginia Wolf's life.

453,rfstalvey,An Unflinching & Realistic Look at Mental Illness,10,6 February 2003,"This movie is amazing in many ways.  The most exceptional is Kidman's dead-on portrayal of Virginia Woolf, a woman I have spent many years researching, both on an academic level and then a personal one.  Having Bipolar Disorder, as Woolf did, I was extremely sceptical of Kidman's ability to embody the day-to-day struggle of manic-depression.  She was phenomenal, as were the other cast members.  Moore shines as a woman wrestling with depression, and Streep is, as usual, utterly convincing.  I loved this movie, particularly a scene between Woolf and her husband at the train station.  This exchange was like seeing my own life on the screen, done with compassion as well as utter brutality.  Unlike other movies that deal with mental illness, for example, Girl, Interrupted, the characters never had to truly ""go off the deep end"" to convey the debilitation of depression.  This movie can, however, be unsettling for those who have been in similar situations.  If the true intent of an excellent drama is to make the audience feel, then The Hours deserves any and all awards it receives.",The Hours

The hype surrounding the movie, made me doubt that this would be anything worthwhile so I was a bit apprehensive to see how the adaptation of the wonderful book had turned out. I was blown away! Nicole Kidman made a very believable and heart wrenching Virginia Woolf, effectively portraying her need to get out of the town and the ""madness"" that was inside her mind (the scenes with her sister were particularly emotional). I feel that - regardless of the controversy surrounding her award - the Academy made the right decision in awarding her unbelievable performance with statue! She was amazing. Julianne Moore did a fantastic turn as Laura Brown, portraying her with such feeling and understanding that the viewer couldn't help but empathise. Meryl Streep, I thought was perhaps the weakest of a fantastic bunch! Her performance was great, but I expected just a tiny little bit more from her - still believable though! The supporting cast and music really contributed to the overall emotion fuelled journey the viewer is taken on. For those who say that it was too long, for me it ended too quick - I would gladly have sat through another 2 hours of this masterpiece!

456,dimmickx,An unfortunate projection of a feminist fantasy,1,2 February 2003,"It is always a shame when writers misrepresent important historical figures in order to serve their own moral or political ends. The Hours is no exception. The implication that Virginia Woolf's suicide was brought on by a longing for the companionship of another woman and her inability to escape her heterosexual relationship with a loving, but unsatisfying husband, is more a matter of the writer's whim than of any historical evidence. Although the message is subtly hidden behind the drama of the film, the blind groping towards a neo-feminist emotional rallying cry is obvious to anyone critically watching the movie.The truth is that Woolf was completely in love with her husband, a fact that is evident to anyone who has done research on the diaries and journals left behind by this important literary figure. Her unfortunate death (correctly portrayed in the film as the result of a suicide drowning) was almost certainly the result of a long standing fight with clinical depression, and the potential exists that Woolf may also have been laboring under the horror of schizophrenia, a malady for which there was no clear diagnosis or treatment at the time. Ample evidence can be found in the personal writings of Woolf, who in many letters expressed her melancholy, her thoughts of suicide, and her awareness of `strange voices' that she began to hear near the end of her life. Her death was the result of untreated mental illness, not emotional suffocation from an unfulfilling relationship.
The film was well acted, and the writing was solid. However, the film did not have a true sense of self, blindly groping about in an effort to make an emotional point that was lost in a field of misguided political messages.As far as critics are concerned, there seems to be a strong polarization of the film between those who enjoy subtle drama and those who enjoy practical storylines with logical characters. In turn, the former are called pretentious by the latter, and the latter are called `attention seeking' or blind by the former. I personally believe that this movie will be heralded by those who agree with its moral and political premise, and dismissed by those that do not. Considering Hollywood's exceptionally clear political bent, I have no doubt that The Hours will be up for several Oscars.
Mind you, I am a fan of subtle drama, but in this movie, something is simply missing.The film certainly enjoys high production values and benefits from superb performances. It is simply unfortunate that the considerable acting talents of the principal actresses were wasted on such a plodding, inaccurate, faux-artistic, and ultimately uninteresting piece of film. It's all been done before, and much more solidly than in this film.",The Hours

458,kilgore415,It is only I that can know my own darkness,10,23 February 2003,"The idiocy of some comments already made here pertaining to the supposed ""idiocy"" of this movie, are well idiotic. I have read comments that bemoan the three stories as being one, two, or even three too many for many different reasons, but one that sticks out to me most is the notion that it was ""bad"" because it was a literary technique and therefore should be admonished because it was ""not from the heart.""Well, what exactly is from the heart? Was this movie an objective study of depression, insanity, or women? No. Did it deal with depression and insanity? Yes. Do we get to rational states of being through periods of emotion and irrationality? Perhaps, and if that is so then everything in one sense or the other would be the all too coveted ""from the heart."" This movie was wonderfully done it that it worked with different stories that were connected in one way or another by the central character of Virginia Woolf. However, there is another comment that needs to be addressed...Someone else wrote that the women in this novel were terrible human beings who only had to deal with mental illness. This is an unfortunate reality that is all too present today in that people still do not believe that mental illness is real and that it is the easy way out for some people. I have lived with a dear family member who would frequently have slip into dementia and I have a wife who has dealt with depression and let me tell you that they are both real things that are caused by real things and in turn cause other real and scary things to happen. Laura Brown tried to deal with her depression, but her husband did not even recognize that anything was wrong. Her husband believed in people playing roles and as is exquisitely explained in an almost suffocating dinner scene he views her as a fantasy and in this fantasy he makes her right, but she has no will of her own. She cannot choose between anything except living or dying, but she chooses to live. Had she not left she would have died because she had no choice in anything around her. In essence she was a puppet. This type of sickness is still very real today and needs to be recognized so that others like Laura Brown can have another choice and that is too find help for themselves.
Virginia Woolf, on the other hand, attempted to fight her disease. She did not want to stay away from it because ""you cannot find peace by avoiding life."" Or, you cannot solve your problems by ignoring them. The unfortunate thing here is that she was not able to overcome and there are many implications in the film that the only who really tried to help her was her husband. Her sister seemed to be afraid of her and her nephews thought she was a joke. It is impossible to deny that Virginia Woolf was not simply sad (although she was) or that she simply did not like the way things were (although she did not) and therefore it is impossible to deny that her problems were indeed very real and that her sickness, while hers in her own unique way, is not uniquely hers and existed before her, existed after her, and exists now, but more often than not is ignored. Do not take this movie of a trite example of a sad woman, but take it as a commentary on all of us; who we are and what we believe in.",The Hours

I had just seen Nicole Kidman in some great movies so I convinced my mom and we went to go see it. Immediately, the movie blew me away. I sat, transfixed the entire time. There were some great ideals in the movie that I think are missing from a lot of pictures these days. It makes you think how women had to live in the past, versus now. If something wasn't socially recognized, and it happened...People pretended it didn't. The movie gave me the message that you have to do what is inside. Not what is accepted.",The Hours

It was one of the very few movies I would have walk out on had I not been with others. Rather than making one sympathetic to the various women's plight, I found that I saw individuals wallowing in their own misery and embracing it. I have known many who have suffered from depression and bipolar disorder as well - in my own family. They did not wallow in their sometimes self-created depression but rather sought to overcome it. Self-pity is not pretty, and that seems to be what the movie is about. Since 2002 ""The Hours"" has been up there with ""Romie and Michelle's Class Reunion"" as the brunt of jokes. For what it's worth, my wife and sister-in-law generally share my sentiment, though not as vociferously.",The Hours

I hope I don't have to be ashamed, that I as a male, liked this movie so much, which is often called ""a typical women movie"". I enjoyed the playing of Julianne Moore, who is one of my favorite actresses. Nicole Kidman and especially Meryl Streep I don't prefer so much, but they fitted in well. It was a lot of crying in the film , but I never felt like it was unnatural on the look on the story. The Cuts from period to period were very soft and nice. What I loved, was the feeling when I come out of the cinema. I still had this melodramatic feeling in my heart, and this is what films are about.

466,koalaquesadilla,Much Angst-Accurately,7,5 November 2010,"To fulfill the ""guidelines"" of IMDb, I will start off by saying that I did not enjoy watching this film. However, I found it to be an incredibly accurate depiction of depression supported by impeccable acting by a knock-out cast; plus, the positivity of the final scene (for some of the characters, at least) was refreshing.Moving on to my motivation for a review-please post this, IMDb. This segment is still elementarily in regards to the content of the film and I think it will also provide a necessary rebuttal to a polarizing argument which could keep folks from experiencing what is really a great piece of cinema.I just read a review by Eric Allen. The writing was satisfactory and it made a couple of valid points, but I was displeased with the piece in general.There was one point in particular with which I took offense. The review expressed utter disgust and disillusionment with the angst in this movie, or, more specifically, with the admittedly large quantity of *sighs* present in the film. It went on to discuss the over-the-top nature of Woolf's (Kidman's) Clarissa's (Streep's), and Laura's (Moore's) respective depressions, making such post-production suggestions as titling the film ""Just Kill Yourself Already"".I will offer that I, too, was a bit put off by the overall negative attitude of the film and the constant over-analysis and drama on the part of its characters. However, I recognized that these aspects of the film were accurate to actual depression patients.And consider this: the film is about parallels between the minds of three women, one of whom is Virginia Woolf, writer of the tragic ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and eventual suicide case-a victim of her own torturous mind. Entering such a film, is there not an expectation or rather a necessity of the presence of angst? Additionally, the reviewer I mentioned earlier made it seem as though these women are anomalies of the human condition. They are not: According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 14.8 million Americans, or 6.7% of the population ages 18 and older, suffer from Major Depressive Disorder, making it the country's leading cause of disability. Though there are some clues as to the causation of depression, such as chemical in-balance or lack of exercise or proper nutrition, no one knows for sure.As one can see, these women are not anomalies. They are not freaks to be looked down upon by some ignorant, condescending internet reviewer-these characters provide incredibly accurate representation of the experiences men and women who for centuries have suffered silently with similar symptoms of depression. Depression is real, and it is all too common.So, as happy as I am that Mr. Eric Allen is ignorant to the realities of depression, I would appreciate it if next time he conducted some research to gather adequate knowledge of his subject before he writes his reviews. That way, he won't sound like an ignorant bigot and we won't have to waste our time on unfounded ""pseudo-intellectual"" (Allen) scribble.",The Hours

The main questions are what makes us happy with our lifes and if we appear in society as happy ... are we ? Another question is, I believe the hardest, what to choose, either life in ""agony"" or death. We are all different people, each of us goes through different happyness and pain and that's why each of us can discover something else in this genious picture. Movie by itself show it's story in interesting way completing itself at the very end, informing you about story events in small parts, keeping you unsure of what is the in-movie fiction and what is the main movie story. In my opinion all actors/actress made a great job, and each of them have it's own part in the story.

471,MoTo123,A Rotting Pile of Politically Correct Tripe,1,30 May 2003,"The WORST movie of 2002, this film is politically correct nonsense for the NOW crowd. If you identify with NOW--as most of the people on the Oscar nomination committee apparently do--you will LOVE this film. Stop reading and rent it now. Otherwise, let the Hollywood crowd congratulate themselves, save two hours of your life, and skip this celluloid stinker.To set the stage:  The film opens with three depressed lesbians (one ""out"", two not ""out""). They are in a tizzy about, well, basically nothing. They spend the majority of the film moping around their homes whining about their relatively easy lives. (Think about how others were living in the world during these periods in history--each one of these women lives a comparative life of luxury.)  One of them actually has the unbearable burden of a single (1, one, uno) well-behaved child to raise! Poor dear.
In one particularly disgusting incestuous scene a repressed 1920s lesbian forcibly locks lips with her non-lesbian 50-something sister. (The first woman is one of the ""heroines"" of the film.)  Another ""heroine"" in this group ends up abandoning her family and ruining their lives, however we are expected to feel sorry for her. Sure. If this JACKASS had been a man, he would have been soundly--and rightly--demonized. But this is feminist cinema, so we can't be that politically incorrect, can we?
Other scenes glorify ""noble"" suicide. Jack Kevorkian himself could not have done a better job. WARNING: DO NOT let your depressed teen watch this film. You may be profoundly sorry.The only good thing about this film is the interesting time-shifting transition that occurs between scenes.

Eagerly I put this tape into my VCR and anticipated two hours of a modern-day masterpiece.  But two hours later, when it ended, all I could say was, ""What the heck was that?"" First of all, I was astounded that Nicole Kidman won an Oscar for Best Actress. She was barely in it! Though she did have some decent scenes (such as the scene at the train station), she really didn't do anything but narrate her book, stare blankly, and occasionally scream at her husband for thinking in her best interests. Second, this movie presents a horrible message - that if your life is in the slumps it's perfectly OK to run away from it. Virginia Woolf kills herself and is considered a ""strong woman"". Laura Brown abandons her young children and her character is presented so that you sympathize with her. I couldn't understand why everyone told me this movie had ""strong women"". Running away from your problems is by no means a ""strong"" quality. And I guarantee you, if the characters had been all-male, there would be hordes of women critics screeching about the weak characters, the horrible men who committ suicide and abandon their families. But, of course, it's perfectly fine when a woman does it because she has all these problems to deal with in this dreary phallocentric world. Please! The Hours is yet another good example of the Academy Awards screwing up. While some of the acting was very good (i.e. Meryl Streep and Ed Harris), on the whole it was not Oscar-worthy.

Maybe it was because of this hype, but I wasn't blown away by this movie. While the integration of the three stories into one big story was well done, I was annoyed by the fact that the parallels and similarities between the three main characters weren't so much suggested as thrown in our faces (e.g. the scene with Virginia and Clarissa simultaneously doing their hair and washing their faces).As far as the acting goes Nicole Kidman was definitely the standout here (let's see if I can be the first to not mention the nose...oops too late). She effectively conveyed the profound sadness and frustration of being labeled as ""crazy"" and therefore having all decisions made for her. I was particularly touched by all the scenes of Virginia with Vanessa, and of Virginia and Leonard at the train station. I definitely wasn't as impressed with Meryl Streep (the ""I seem to be unraveling"" tantrum scene was embarrassingly bad and completely unbelievable), Julianne Moore or any of the supporting players (except for maybe Toni Collette), but that could be because a few characters (e.g. Laura Brown) were badly written and very two-dimensional.What was exceptional about this movie was the score provided by Philip Glass.

482,Lester1Adams,The (Interminable) Hours,6,8 August 2005,"I don't usually do movie criticism, but it has been a long time since I saw a movie that left me with such a sense of torpid despondency and hopelessness as THE HOURS. My friend Michael insisted that I go see this ""wonderfully crafted little gem of a movie called THE HOURS that {had} so much to say about the 'human condition'."" That should have been my tip off right there. Why is it that a certain strain of intellectual men (and most women) equate depression (as well as other negative emotions such as sadness and grief) with ""deep thought"" while happiness and uplifting themes (such as the feeling of ecstatic joy one gets from watching the bad guy get what's coming to him in the form of an exploding hand grenade) are equated with air headed frivolity and vulgar pedestrian taste? Their idea of a perfect intellectual conversation seems to be sitting around in a coffee house somewhere in the West Village gazing down into a cup of steaming Kenyan java while complaining to one another about how life has f*$#ed them over; and what beautiful human beings they once were before an unfeeling world crushed them down. Anyway, what follows was my response to an e-mail from Michael asking me how I liked the movie. Well Michael, thanks to your prodding, I went to see THE HOURS, staring the lovely and talented Nicole Kidman, and co-starring Meryl Streep; and Julianne Moore. After leaving the theater I filled my coat pockets with heavy rocks and began walking zombie like toward the river so despondent was I at the prospect of having to face all of those joyless hours which the movie made me feel certain lay ahead of me in life. Only the quick thinking and fast talking of a kindly stranger saved me from a watery grave. The movie was beautifully photographed in hushed, muted, sepia tones to accentuate and reflect the somber, gloomy, disconsolate and hopeless mood of its main characters. (Wasn't it H.D. Thoreau who once said that behind their facades of genial conviviality most women lead lives of quiet desperation in a huddled mass yearning to breathe free?) The acting was exceptionally good and, at least to me, I found the actresses to be compelling in their portrayals of women overcome with, at best, unremitting ennui; and at worst, soul numbing despair. The movie had all the cheer of a cancer ward on a bleak and rainy New England afternoon in late December. Notwithstanding all of the movie's many virtues (and there ARE many), I disliked it for the way it made me feel; and am sorry I went to see it. I should have stayed home and played a nice little uplifting game of Freecell on my computer. For some reason I don't like to be depressed or saddened by things, and very much like to stay out of touch with those particular emotions as much as possible. Years of study and experience have led me to conclude that there is every bit as much to be said for the repression of unpleasant emotions as there is to be said for, say, avoiding contact with hot stove tops. I realize how shallow this is, Michael, but I just can't see DELIBERATELY going to view something that is going to make you feel bad. But that's just one man's opinion; and BEING a man, I recognize that there are certain things that I am simply incapable of understanding. But I DO understand this: On a chick flick scale of one to ten, this movie hits a perfect ten. From a woman's perspective it has everything: unrequited love, love that has died, crying, death, loss, homosexuality, poetry, pernicious diseases (both mental and physical), infidelity and abandonment, manipulation of others, Edwardian settings, turn of the century costumes, the emptiness of life for women in the pore-liberation 1950's, victimized and exploited women, ineffectual and overcompensating men, hand wringing, educated people in touch with their feelings (and those feelings, without exception, all relating to either loss or depression {or both}), sensitive and intelligent women sacrificing their lives for incognizant men who are, for the most part, oblivious of their needs; or, on the flip side, the hollowness of life for over-achieving career women of the 1990's, and on and on and on. You can bet your boots, Michael, that the next movie I go see is going to have plenty of jet fighters in it as well as machine guns, explosions, hand grenades, chain saws, cyborgs from the future, a plot that can be written on the back of a matchbook cover; and plenty of long legged big titted women!

483,amandakaykuenzi,This Movie Changed My Life,10,20 September 2014,"I know a lot of people criticized this film for various reasons but please do yourself a favor and do not listen to any of it. This movie touches on subjects that deeply affect those who either have struggled with mental illness or have a loved one who has. Everything about this movie resonates with me in a very deep way. When the book was getting popular before this film was ever created I went and bought it and read it. I realized about midway through that this was a book that would probably haunt me the rest of my life. I think I see much of myself in each of these women. Virginia Woolf, creative and thoughtful, deeply depressed and almost comforted by the idea of death. Laura Brown, trapped and terrified of her own existence. Clarissa Vauhn, always looking for a trivial distraction, a quiet storm brewing underneath the surface. Everyone questions the meaning of life and the value of life. Everyone thinks about happiness, and remembers the moment they were happiest. These are all mortal realities. Thoughts that plague even the strongest of individuals. Suicide sometimes seems like an inevitable fate, and even a comforting solution. The moment when you meet Laura Brown at the end of the film as an old woman, you think she is going to be this broken and sad person full of regrets but she isn't. You realize that out of all three women she was the one that ultimately chose life. After speaking with Clarissa, you can tell that Clarissa finally understands that sometimes regret is just a word that means nothing. How can you regret when you didn't have a choice? It was either death or leave. Many times in my life I have felt this way. I have left my hometown without saying goodbye to anyone and moved three thousand miles away. I felt trapped, suffocated and very dangerously depressed. When I got to my final destination I felt so free. I could write for days about this movie and it wouldn't do this film justice. If you are a woman and you struggle with mental illness do yourself a favor and watch The Hours. It will give you perspective and comfort. Life isn't always beautiful and sometimes someone has to die to create contrast so that the rest of us value life. It humbles us to see someone take their own life, it makes us squeeze our children a little tighter, makes us sing a little louder, makes us love a little deeper. When Richard dies at the end of the film, you think Clarissa will fall apart and when she doesn't, and you watch this woman in shock somehow come back to life you realize that this man has been holding her back from really enjoying life. His sadness was almost an anchor for her and when he disappears it almost releases her from this darkness that surrounded him. You realize that he really was only sticking around for her. She watches him jump and it's almost like a relief to her. The darkness goes with him. One of the best scenes of the film is almost at the very end. Meryl Streep so passionately kisses her partner. It's beautiful. You can tell she is choosing life. She wants to feel that happiness she once felt again. This movie changed my life. I will never be the same.",The Hours
484,I_am_keyser_soze_333,Structure,9,6 February 2006,"Never before have I seen nor heard of anything of The Hours, directed by Stephen Daldry, until this week when I had to review this film for this assignment. Walking up to the vintage 70's video monitors of McHenry's video library, I subconsciously kept reminding myself that ""Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself."" When that first shot of the river appeared and I heard no mention of Mrs. Dalloway or her flowers, I just thought to myself that ""maybe the director didn't like that opening line of the book."" It wasn't until the voice over narration uttered the name ""From, Virginia Woolf,"" did I realize that this was not a normal film rendition of ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" (nor did I realize it was an actual rendition of a novel called The Hours until I watched the special features after the movie).Coming into this with absolutely no knowledge of what this movie would be about, my film-hungry interest would spark the moment I realized that this movie was going to be taking place at 3 different times and locations with 3 completely different characters. Any movie that breaks away from the normal 3-point chronological narrative structure had to be somewhat intellectually stimulating. And it was. I was excited to find out that Virginia Woolf was going to be an actual movie character occupying Richmond, England in 1923. My excitement even doubled when I found out that not only will the author be represented in this story, but also a 1923 Los Angeles reader of Mrs. Dalloway as well as a modern 2001 New York version of Mrs. Dalloway the character.This structural technique played off well in the telling of these 3 women's stories. By breaking the story up this way, it allowed me, the viewer, to constantly connect Woolf's life to those of her own characters. By cutting between England, Los Angeles, and New York, it helped build an understanding for Woolf's reasons as to why she wrote Mrs. Dalloway the way she did. It's a tool that helps us visually connect themes discussed in the book and in the movie. For example, with the theme of the definition of insanity, I was able to gain a more thorough understanding of the relationship between Septimus and his author. Not only do we get to see the reflection of Woolf through Septimus through this movie, but we also get to see different representations and versions of Septimus. We constantly see Septimus through the movie's characters of Woolf, The Hour's Richard, Laura Brown, and in some ways even Clarissa Vaughn and her somewhat too trivial personality.Through this structure, we're not only able to gain a better understand on Virginia Woolf in relation to her characters in Mrs. Dalloway, but we're also able to see the difference in society during different times and locations. In the movie, each of the 3 women deals with the theme of homosexuality. In Virginia Woolf's story, she kisses and is attracted to Vanessa Belle. The same goes for Laura Brown and her intimate contact with Kitty Barlowe. With Clarissa Vaughn, she is having an open lesbian relationship with Sally Lester. Within these intimate scenes, we sense that within Woolf's time era, it would've been definitely socially unacceptable for a woman to kiss another woman. The same situation would go for Brown's time era. But with Vaughn's time era, we see that it is more socially acceptable to have homosexual relationships. Also within these scenes, we are also able to see different versions of Mrs. Dalloway's Sally Senton.After watching the special features on the novel, The Hours, I felt that this movie rendered the novel very well. Not only did the structure of the film narrative stay true to the novel, but it also allowed Virginia Woolf readers to connect the author to her characters. This movie was splendid in all other filmic aspects as well. It was visually stunning, especially through the changes in color schemes in each different story in order to represent the mood of that story. The acting was at its best; never did the acting distract me from the story. And the story itself was amazing; it built its own suspense just through the viewer trying to figure out how all these stories will somehow connect.",The Hours
485,xavery_pl,"What have I gained after watching ""The Hours""?",10,11 November 2004,"I've never thought that this movie could be so delightful and ... educational. ""The Hours"" tells us about life of three woman, each one in another year. They've all got one common point. A book. It's called ""Mrs Dolloway"" and is being written by one of them. If you expect an nice family fairytale, you won't find it here. ""The Hours"" is a heavy movie, and I wouldn't like to watch it with children, as they would get bored, because they wouldn't understand it. I had to watch the film twice. In the cinema, and later, on my home video. Everyone should watch this movie twice. First time - to get known with the situations. Second time - to see something more than a movie, just like I did.10/10",The Hours
486,conniepohlman,Surprisingly Self Serving Excruciatingly Dull Movie,1,27 August 2009,"A movie only the elitist Academy types could love. Nicole Kidman's role was the highest form of self-centered behavior seen in a movie. Sad to think this movie got so much notoriety when the only purpose was to expose a deeply scowling and self serving woman. At least the other two women were more aware of the consequences of their behavior and chose to rise above their own deeply mired self-serving personalities. Meryl Streep was better. Normally I love any movie she is in. I could not connect with her character in this movie. Julianne Moore's character was probably the most realistic of all three, as she exhibited believable confusion but why must we continually harp on the gay aspect when such a small percentage of people relate to this? And such heavy-handed machinations that were used on Moore's character made me embarrassed to watch her friend's reaction. It's ALL about ME seemed to scream from this movie, and I could not wait for it to finally end. Depressing enough to make one contemplate suicide, I will give it that much.",The Hours
487,emeraldreamer,Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself,9,7 January 2005,"First things first. If anyone wants to watch this movie for the sake of seeing Nicole Kidman, don't because you won't be able to recognize her. (I'm surprised that such people exist) In The Hours, she's no longer a glamour queen sitting on a glamour boat with a glamorous life. (Honestly speaking, though, I find her more beautiful in this than in real life)The story flows through the lives of three women, in three different times. Virginia Woolf, in 1923, Laura Brown, 1952 and Clarissa Vaughn, in 2001, and how their lives meld together in different moments. Each, while dealing with her own problems, is living out the story Virginia is writing, and at the same time, Virginia is writing the story that they are all living. It becomes apparent that Mrs. Dalloway isn't just any one woman, but a series of women who are living lives that they don't want, or accept, all confident, powerful, in their houses, living perfect lives that they cannot tolerate, wanting something, anything at all, which they cannot have. Not only the three main characters, but the women they share their lives with as well. All three actresses, I feel, gave brilliant performances, but I think the most haunting part was played by Julianne Moore, Laura Brown. Her haunted, empty look, on the verge of unraveling into madness, her understated voice, her blank eyes, her desperate attempt and failure to love her son, all point to the talents of a great actress. (And then the Academy gives the Oscar to Catherine Zeta-Jones) Also, watch out for the music. The haunting flow of it is something that no one should miss.",The Hours
488,donbkipp,"""The Hours""",10,10 May 2013,"Without reservation, ""The Hours"" is an excellent film interpretation of an equally excellent book. Perhaps because the story jumps around some, it works even better as a film. I don't see how the acting could have been improved. Nicole Kidman is astounding! Glen Close and Julienne Moore are wonderful. Ed Harris in his small role, well I've always thought he is a great actor, is great. I doubt there's ever been a more gracefully surprising defenestration in any movie before or since this. Not only does Nicole Kidman manage to look not like Nicole Kidman, she delivers 100% in a difficult role of a difficult, tortured, brilliant woman. ""The Hours"" is an important book and an important movie. I am delighted and grateful to know a lot more about this tragic, important writer. If this movie helped to ensure her the proper honors she deserves in the history of literature, (I imagine it will) I am grateful. I",The Hours
489,lizdouglas,A Definite Must,10,10 January 2005,"The Hours was truly inspiring, undoubtedly one of my favourite films. The characters are endearing and the cast are superb. The Oscar nominations speak for themselves. There was nothing to fault the film, and with little or no knowledge of Virginia Woolf's 'Mrs Dalloway', the film will still captivate. The structure is so very clever, sistering the plot, once you begin to watch it, you will be gently encouraged into the intertwining lives of the three women. It is highly recommendable to those of intellect, or a willing to understand. The film is not action packed, nor comedic and will not appeal to viewers with flimsy preferences. This is an intense and wonderful film, if you have not seen it, please please do.",The Hours
490,michalis_2345,A true diamond,10,23 April 2021,"My absolute No1 movie of all time dealing with a matter so universal, in an astonishingly simple yet complex way, how people perceive happiness and choose to live accordingly. What is so different in these 3 women in these 3 different timelines is exactly the same thing that unites them. The essence of not being the protagonists on their own act, of something missing, of not having the control over their lives, of utterly being miserable no matter how much settled their lives seem to be. It is a pure masterpiece unlike any other ever made
about life itself, yet never got the recognition it deserved. So underrated!!!",The Hours
491,grace_with_fire,this is about a woman's life,8,28 February 2005,"i don't think The Hours is just another suicide movie. i haven't read the book but as i watched the film, i could definitely sense some sort of intuitive understanding of it.the title itself, and some particularly telling dialogue (how Clarissa thinks Richard's ""look"" means she preoccupies herself too much with triviality) highlights a fact of life most people (including the woman her self!) commonly do not pay attention to-- a woman's life.a woman's life is generally made up of the little moments, ""the hours"", those seemingly insignificant, trivial and dull moments of picking out flowers to buy, baking a cake, talking with a friend, being there for a suffering friend, planning a party -- which still ultimately defines the quality of her whole life.if the moments, the hours, are the hours she has freely and consciously chosen (Laura saying, ""what shall we do today?"") then it becomes an empowering and full life for her; if the hours are dictated by what she ""must do"" as a wife, mother, daughter, friend, then it could become a limiting and deadening life for her (remember Virginia Woolf at the train station, explaining to her husband how it feels to be living a life she did not choose for her self).as i understand it, suicide is the ultimate act of self-reclamation. when you are feeling helpless and powerless about many aspects of your life, it can be the final liberating and empowering moment, taking back what was rightfully yours in the first place.so i viewed this as a movie about three women who struggled and dealt with, in their own way, the deadening effects of a sanitized life-- whether caused by the small-mindedness of social mores and conventions about how a woman should be, that nameless emptiness one feels in a lonely marriage, or the prison of regret over what could have been and trying to make up for it for the rest of one's life.indeed, it is a disturbing movie, because it takes us to something which we commonly ignore and forces us to take a look at it again and re-think what it means again. (look at your wife, mother, sister, girl friend again, and ponder what she does with her hours, and whether she's happy with them... or, if you're a woman, too, look at your life again!)Brent Trafton is also right in saying that it is a movie for people who care enough to think about the movie and what it means long after they have left the theatre",The Hours
492,katbc128,Waste of Time,1,18 April 2018,"I hesitated to watch this movie as it has an all female cast in the main roles, but since Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman are outstanding actors I gave it a shot. What a huge waste of my time! The only thing I can say that was good about this film was that it was intriguing enough to compel me to view it twice in order to understand what it was all about which was a study of two morose women, who cared for no one but themselves and a third, played by Streep, who was like a flighty bird flitting from being a happy party giver to one who is mourning a lost moment of happiness while still caring for the man she once loved. Amazing that so many viewers saw these self absorbed women as anything but pathetic creatures.",The Hours
493,javrec76,Post-view on 'The Hours',9,28 May 2005,"""A woman's whole life in a single day. Just one day and, in that day, her whole life."" Virginia Woolf thought that is how long it takes to see the ""networks of caring relationships"" that make up a woman's life as she undertook the writing of Mrs. Dalloway. For his part, Michael Cunningham, who was fascinated with Woolf's writing after first reading Mrs. Dalloway, delves further into this idea in The Hours. He, too, thought that ""everything you need to know about a human life is contained in every day of every human life."" Both texts present us women characters whose lives take place in the domestic, and who opt for different ways of dealing with similar situations.Life is made up of little details, of small things, of hours; the sooner you come to terms with this fact, and learn to value them, the sooner you will be happy and content in life. This is the bottom line both authors deal with in their respective works. ""Mrs. Dalloway will kill herself over something that doesn't seem to matter"", says Woolf in the film. Her first intention was to have Mrs. Dalloway kill herself after the party. In such case, her death would have seemed senseless from outside, but it would have meant how Clarissa could not cope with her role of 'Mrs. Dalloway.' Eventually, though, Woolf changed her mind and had Septimus kill himself instead. When considering these two possible outcomes of life, she decided to explore them both, and therefore created a new character. In The Hours, when asked ""why does someone have to die?"", Woolf responds: ""so that the others will value life more."" The final scenes in The Hours also sum up this idea. Michael Cunningham splits the character of Mrs. Dalloway in Woolf's text into three different women and explores the possible alternatives to how to cope with the hours: ""We throw our parties; we abandon our families to live alone in Canada; we struggle to write books that do not change the world. [] We live our lives [] and then we sleep  it's as simple and ordinary as that."" However, it is not always easy to come to accept life ""for what it is"". The three women in The Hours signify the different alternatives. First, Virginia Woolf is trapped into her 'Mrs. Dalloway' persona and feels she cannot go on with her life as it is. At the train station scene, she speaks her mind to her husband and wants to be heard: ""it is my voice speaking!"" as opposed to the voices she hears when her husband tries to pacify her. ""My life has been stolen from me [] I am living a life I have no wish to live [] If it's Richmond or death, I choose death""; Woolf rebels against her role, she does not want to accept it. Instead, she chooses to move back to London. Laura, for her part, is totally overwhelmed by her role as a housewife/mother, her 'Mrs. Dalloway' costume, as it were. Even though she has a caring loving husband and son, she feels oppressed by the life she leads: ""it was death"", she confesses to Clarissa later on in the film. When her husband tells the story of how he fell in love with her, we get a better notion of the kind of person she used to be as an individual and how she is also living a life she has no wish to live, and how her life, too, has been stolen from her. When she goes to the hotel room, she realizes she has momentarily stepped out of her life, which helps her make a decision. What follows is a good example of how the three stories in the film are intertwined. As we see Laura lying on the bed, waiting for the end to set her free, then Virginia Woolf changes her mind, and decides Mrs. Dalloway will not die. Next, Laura sits up and decides to go back home. ""The poet will die"", says Woolf and, in the next scene, we see Richard jump out of the window. Virginia Woolf acts as a master of puppets, as it were, in these scenes. Eventually, we learn that Laura ""chose life"", since her life in Los Angeles meant death for her, and ran away to Canada. Finally, Clarissa who seems to be leading a meaningful life, feels appalled when she realizes her life is merely trivial Richard and her daughter excepted. ""Mrs. Dalloway, always giving parties to cover the silence"", says Richard to her. Clarissa takes up her 'Mrs. Dalloway' role, nursing Richard, giving parties, etc., but she feels there is nothing underneath. Clarissa's life seems only to be a collection of trivialities. In the end, she understands that that is what life is: ""I remember waiting for happiness to arrive, and now I realize that that was happiness: right there, that exact moment."" At the end of the film, when Clarissa turns the lights off, we have a sense of going forward, of progress. She has finally understood what life is all about. ""To look life in the face and to know it, to love it for what it is."" This quote from Virginia Woolf's last speech summarizes the mood of the film; finally, it all makes sense. Later on in her life, Virginia Woolf felt she was going mad and resolved to kill herself. Despite this, she had understood: ""Always the years between us, always the love, always the hours.""",The Hours

The acting of Nicole Kidman was touching and magnificent. The way she approached and bonded with Virginia Wolf was amazing and anyone who can see in depth in a movie can see that. Of course the other two actresses were fantastic as well because they influenced the plot and success of the movie also.

The three performances by those excellent actresses was superb. Especially Nicole Kidman who deserved the Oscar she won for it. She didn't get it for Moulin Rouge, but certainly came back on the next year to claim it, and what better way to do it than filming The Hours. I also loved the performances of Julianne Moore and Mery Streep. Wonderful actresses!!!! I really think that Julianne Moore is deserving of an Oscar already. I thought she had a very good chance of getting it with this picture, but i also agree in Catharine Zeta-Jones winning it. She was also superb in Chicago.

But not many movies can describe living as a woman no matter 'when' and 'where' do you live, like 'The Hours' did. Three different women, they look different, their personalities are different, and they have to deal with their own different problems everyday .... but ironically they are all connected with another fictitious woman character, 'Mrs. Dalloway', so no matter how different they are, they go through with the same fate, 'living as women'.I am a woman too. I know the world is getting better and women's right has been improved a lot, but still a lot of women live under glass ceiling, which ask women to do this and do this, or not to do this... I hope this kind of movies keep coming so that we all can slowly break glass ceiling one by one.",The Hours
498,serge-97,Multilayeredly deep and profound; the best acting,10,22 July 2021,"The movie's set-up serves to bolden one of the core dilemmas posed in the film - a choice to live for yourself or for others, a question which greatly contrasted in the film through a prism of experience of woman particularly.This dilemma is cinematically posed via quite a dramatical swings in the lives of the characters - from what often is considered to be, arguably, a most selfish act a person could commit to themselves (and by extension to the close others), to the selfless, altruistic dedication to the unfortunate others without hope and objective, practical perspective for their own lives. Although even in this scenario, it loops right back to the the darkest impulses, acts, and outcomes one may choose in the context of ""living for yourself,"" however it may be justified by their specific, objective or perceived circumstances. This line is particularly underscored by the role of the dying poet (Ed Harris), notably a man, in the day of Meryl Streeps's character's life.The movie, albeit in rather a thin sideline, also annotates a vague, but recognizable, progression in women's control over their lives decisions, unrelated to the law, but purely as individual choices about how to handle sometimes ultimate live decisions, while still maintaining a traditional propensity for ""living for others,"" albeit, perhaps, not as much to their own detriment and sacrifice, as used to be in the past.Despite as this description may suggest or hint to, the film is decidedly not about women's empowerment. The undertones of feminism possibly may be inferred on a much deeper examination, interpretation, and analysis of the plot, but on the face of it, they are extremely tangential and highly out-of-focus, despite of the all-women leading characters, all of which are superbly acted, especially the Virginia Wolf's character by Nicole Kidman - and acting achievement in its own right.",The Hours

Today I put on my messenger notes that THE HOURS--the movie that encaptures my mood today.
