0,Leofwine_draca,All of the right ingredients for your usual Hollywood thriller,5,4 January 2017,"Dominic Sena's follow-up to GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS is a film that looks very much like its predecessor, mainly because the two movies share the same greenish filter. There's a pulse-pounding gratuitous car-chase that also belongs in GONE, but being so stylishly portrayed I couldn't complain. The difference between the two movies is that SWORDFISH has a slightly more complex plot, and that it's certainly a film with more of an adult nature - expect sexual situations, mucho profanity and nudity (a famous topless scene with recent Oscar-winner Halle Berry, which received much publicity at the time) and even a little bit of nasty violence here and there.Whilst the plot is nothing new, the film adds intrigue by murkying the characters and backgrounds of the typical bad guys, so that you never know who really is who. In this day and age, there's the expected twist-upon-a-twist-upon-a-twist ending to keep you guessing. As for the action scenes, well they are pretty impressive, done in an over the top style. There's a sequence at the end involving a flying bus (!) which is very ludicrous, but makes for great screen entertainment and is a lot of fun. The opening special effect, slowing a bomb blast in 360-degree slow motion, is also great and a real show-stopper.Hugh Jackman is just about passable in the bland leading role part, but doesn't make an impression as in his previous X-MEN movie: he's just there, the straight man, and not very charismatic. John Travolta gives us the obnoxious helium-sniffing villainous routine as done before in FACE/OFF, except he's a little bit more layered and restrained this time around. Halle Berry contributes certain assets to the production in a mysterious role, whilst Don Cheadle and Vinnie Jones are as good as they ever have been in minor supporting roles. SWORDFISH is one of those modern blockbusters done in a snazzy, different, modern, way but still offering the same old goods underneath: action, computers, sex, comedy, violence, and races against the clock. Not a masterpiece, but probably worth a watch.",Swordfish
1,SnoopyStyle,Look Ma! Boobs!,5,3 March 2015,"Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) has taken 22 hostages and rigged them with explosives. One hostage is pulled away by some police on the ground and explodes. Four days earlier, criminal Axel Torvalds is arrested at LAX but he's actually working for Senator James Reisman (Sam Shepard). In Texas, Ginger Knowles (Halle Berry) approaches convicted hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman). His hard partying ex Melissa (Drea de Matteo) with a porn king as her new man won't let him see his daughter Holly. He accepts $100k from Ginger to meet Shear. He helps hack into DEA dummy corporations that was codenamed Swordfish that had been shut down. Agent Roberts (Don Cheadle) used to head a large cyber security team but burned out. He interrogates Axel but hit-man Marco (Vinnie Jones) skillfully kills the suspect.The story is a mess. The characters are all over the top. Travolta is ridiculous but I'm willing to buy into this cartoon villain. On the other hand, I can't really buy Jackman as a hacker. Does he hack in between squats? Halle Berry has a special purpose in this movie. She flashes us her boobs in the most blatant way possible. Everything is played to its most ridiculous version. One must give director Dominic Sena credit for throwing everything at the screen. Jobson's audition is definitely memorable. The movie never lets a good explanation or compelling acting get into the way of some absurd flashiness.",Swordfish
2,Prismark10,Sword Play,4,28 November 2013,"I wonder how this film would had mapped out if it was released after 9/11 rather then several months before it?Hugh Jackman is a computer hacker who wants access to his daughter but his porn star wife will not allow him access. I presume being a hacker is worse than appearing in porn films.John Travolta plays a ruthless criminal with an intelligence background who wants him to hack into a government bank and steal billions of dollars locked in by the DEA.During all too yellow scenes (not sure why there was so much yellow filter) we have car chases, dodgy politicians, explosions, pyrotechnics and Halle Berry's boobs which are more preferable to Travolta's.Jackman tries to keep up with all the cat and mouse play and Don Cheadle is the FBI agent rather flummoxed as to what is going on.John Travolta plays Gabriel a film freak who is obsessed with keeping terrorism out of America. He wants to combat force with even more force. Something Donald Rumsfeld might had approved of.Gabriel comes across as an ethically bankrupt man, in an amoral story where we are supposed to root for a dubious good guy who wants to cause havoc against people and nations he views as villains.When in the early part of the movie we see another computer hacker taken out by a hit-man who also shoots his lawyer for some reason, you know this film is going to have a suspect morality.",Swordfish
3,gavin6942,Good Fun,7,7 January 2016,"The world's most dangerous spy (John Travolta) is hired by the CIA to coerce a computer hacker (Hugh Jackman) recently released from prison to help steal $6 billion in unused government funds.The film received a great deal of press initially because it featured Halle Berry's first topless scene. She was paid an extra $500,000 on top of her $2 million fee to appear topless in this film. Critics said the scene looked forced, thrown into the film just to garner press. Berry said she did the topless scene, knowing it was gratuitous, to overcome the fear of appearing nude on screen.Well, Berry's body aside, the film is fairly entertaining. Not maybe a very deep script, but an exciting one. There is just a pinch of ethics involved, with John Travolta's character showing us the pitfalls of utilitarian thinking. (Or, if not pitfalls, at least the sacrifices that would have to be made for such a pure philosophy.)",Swordfish
4,jboothmillard,Swordfish,3,21 April 2008,"I knew this was going to be a bit of a rubbish film (not just because the critics give it two out of five stars), but you have to make sure anyway. Basically it is a not too distant future relying on a lot more computer technology. The DEA shut down their dummy corporation operation codenamed ""Swordfish"" in 1986, letting $400 million sit around, and compound interest 15 years later has increased it to $9.5 billion. Suave villain Gabriel Shear (John Travolta), head of counter-terrorist unit Black Cell, wants the money to finance a vengeance war, but super-encryption has locked it away. So he hires convicted hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) to break into the government mainframes and get the money. Oh, Stanley only wants to see his daughter Holly (Camryn Grimes) again, but he is stopped by legal fees, and later Gabriel kidnaps her. To be honest, I'd say most people (including me) want to see it for Halle Berry as Ginger Knowles (secretly working for the DEA) in those sexy black bra and underwear, and the quick glimpse of her breasts. Also starring Don Cheadle as Agent J.T. Roberts, Vinnie Jones as Marco and Sam Shepard as Senator James Reisman. Besides the beauty of Berry, there are some other moments worth watching, e.g. explosions, gun play, a chase, and a not-to-bad surprise ending. Adequate!",Swordfish
5,ccthemovieman-1,First Viewing Was A 'Blast',6,20 August 2006,"Here's a film I really liked the first time, and was totally turned off on the second viewing as the Hollywood bias machine was in high gear again, and you can guess in what director (left or right). Anyway, two things remained the same: John Travolta as ""Gabriel Shear"" was riveting as an anti-terrorist terrorist. The explosion scene where people are flying sideways is awesome, particularly in the sound department if you have surround system. Oh, and yes, Halle Berry and her figure was on display in this film and quite a sight. Wowzer!Some of this script is a takeoff on Dog Day Afternoon, which Travolta's character re-enacts a role from that famous '70s film. ""Shear"" talks about that movie during the film. I almost got discouraged watching this in the first half hour because there is so much computer terminology that I was lost. However, if you find yourself in a similar spot, take heart because that that ends after that first 30 minutes and is no longer a problem.Credibility and bias aside, it's still a fun movie for at least one viewing, with that early bomb scene most memorable.",Swordfish
6,rmax304823,"Click, Boom",4,29 May 2002,"This one is an efficient time waster.  If you want a nonsensical plot, lots of car chases, ugly guns, exploding vehicles, fireballs, and all the rest of what passes for an action movie you can find it here.The plot: complicated.  Sometimes complicated unnecessarily by lax editing. A huge bank robbery preceded by a slam-bang auto-destruction fest comes as a surprise.  Also when Gabriel picks up the phone to talk to the police and says, ""I want that plane on the runway -- NOW.""  What plane?  It's the first we've heard of it.  The story revolves around the cracking of a computer code that hides a huge stash of money, as has already been pointed out.  I can't criticize the computer stuff because it was all Greek to me.  I gather that a complex virus or virem, as they seem to call it, is used to hide whatever is being hidden.  (I didn't know a virus could protect a file.) When it is finally revealed on the computer screen it looks like a structural model of a simple molecule.  Well, okay.  The scenes of Stanley working on the problem focus mainly on his face.  Fiddling with a PC is, like typing, extremely difficult to dramatize.  Plot strings dangle without resolution.  (Why and how does Stanley, poking around in Gabe's wine cellar, suddenly come across what looks like Gabe's frozen severed head?  Whose body, looking exactly like a half-barbecued Gabe, shows up on the pathologist's table at the end and how did it get there?  And so forth.) The photography is adequate.  The score is awful: Hip hop music is supposed to excite us as Stanley wrestles with the code (the lyric seems to consist of an expression something like ""a million ****ing bits"", over and over). Suspenseful moments are adumbrated by a ripoff of the penultimate cacaphonous glissando from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Enough plot.Acting.  John Travolta has had a strangely maculate career -- even for a guy from New Jersey.  He's an appealing, natural sort of actor.  But twenty years ago, during his heart throb period, he turned in not only good work, as in ""Urban Cowboy,"" but also films that allowed the producers to exploit his sexuality -- focusing on his crotch as he swings down the street in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" calling his character ""Strip"" in another film while Lilly Tomlin rubs his belly (!).  After a rather long hiatus he reemerged as quite a decent actor, playing good guys and bad.  But again, he's made choices that leave one agoggle at his lack of perception.  ""Battlefield Earth""?  ""Swordfish""?  Where is his agent?  Halle Berry looks exquisite.  I haven't seen the performance for which she won the latest academy award but it would have been difficult to predict such a win from this movie.  And talk about gratuitous nudity.  One or two rather relaxed shots of her topless.  (And an earlier shot of two bimbos at a party stepping daintily into a pool with their bare buns bobbling.)  The gratuitous nudity helps a little but can't save the movie all by itself.  And really, if someone wanted to give an African-American woman an important award like this, how did Cicely Tyson get skipped over?  Now THERE is an actress.In the end, this is merely another one of those preposterous movies filled with a good guy and multiple bad guys and lots of bullet holes in everything and motion galore.  Kind of like pornography, with just enough of a perfunctory plot to link together the more engrossing moments.  Nothing that hasn't been done elsewhere, and better.  If your taste runs along these lines, almost any Schwarzenegger, Stallone, or Segal movie will do as well. Check out ""True Lies"" or something.  Instead of a helicopter carrying a bus, it has a Harrier gone berserk.",Swordfish
7,Tweekums,Enjoyable if rather silly action,7,10 December 2017,"'Swordfish' opens with what at first appears to be a bank robbery going horribly wrong; the police pull a hostage wearing an explosive jacket away from one of the criminals and she explodes causing major damage. We then jump back four days and see a computer hacker arrested coming into the United States; he is then killed while in FBI custody. A second hacker, Stanley Jobson, is approached by a beautiful woman, Ginger Knowles, and offered a job at first he declines as he will be sent to jail if he so much as touches a computer but when offered $100,000 just to discuss the job he can't say no. After a rather extreme test of his skills he finds that his potential employer, Gabriel Shear, will pay him ten million dollars if he helps him steal over nine billion dollars from secret government slush funds. Shear states that he intends to use the money to fund a private war on terrorism. Things soon get very dangerous for Stanley; the FBI are closing in on him and Shear's backer wants to shut down the operation permanently. If that weren't enough it appears that Ginger is an undercover DEA agent.This film starts well with an intriguing prologue and the story provides plenty of action and excitement from start to finish. There are numerous explosions and shooting scenes as well as other tense moments. There are however moments that don't look that real; the first explosion may have looked great when the film was new but the CGI enhancements are fairly obvious and the hacking scenes are fairly painful to watch even people like me who know nothing about hacking know it wouldn't look like that it was hard to believe Stanley was even typing rather than just pressing keys rather fast! At least the shootout while driving through LA was pretty cool and the way a bus was carried by a Skycrane helicopter was impressive. The cast did a solid job; Hugh Jackman was solid as Stanley, John Travolta hammed it up delightfully as Shear and Halle Berry impressed as Ginger even if her topless sunbathing scene was an entirely gratuitous excuse to show her bare breasts. While his role wasn't that large Don Cheadle was fine as FBI Agent J.T. Roberts, it is a pity his role wasn't larger. Overall this is a decent enough action film which it entertaining if you can suspend your disbelief and ignore a few obvious flaws.",Swordfish
8,blanche-2,Disappointing,6,29 April 2009,"I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman's, so I looked forward to seeing ""Swordfish,"" which also stars another actor I like, John Travolta. The film was not produced with an eye to my demographic, so I did not like it as much as some people may have.Travolta plays this incredibly ruthless man, someone committed to keeping the country safe from terrorists, who offers a hacker with child custody issues (Jackman) a chance to make a fortune, enabling him to hire a top attorney and get custody of his daughter. He needs the code cracked to a bank and account holding $9 billion in government money, and the money disseminated to various accounts.The beginning of the film is fascinating - it's Travolta discussing the film Dog Day Afternoon - but alas, it's downhill from there. I'm normally not the most technically observant person when I'm watching a movie, but even I could tell that computerized images and miniatures did a lot of the work.Hallie Berry gets to show off most of her beautiful body and there's plenty of action. Young men, I'm sure, love this film. Unfortunately I'm not a young man. And after seeing ""Swordfish,"" I was 1 hour and 39 minutes older.",Swordfish
9,Quinoa1984,Some spectacular action set pieces (and Berry's breasts) make this worth the 8.50,6,8 June 2001,"Swordfish succeeds and fails, and it also has some really outstanding moments involving a bus flying in the air with help from a helicopter, a daring car chase with multiple casualties, and oh yeah, large heaving breasts.Hugh Jackman plays a down on his luck hacker who gets a chance to finally get his daughter back by pulling off a scheme for a multi-millionaire who might not be all that he seems, played by Travolta in his best performance in 2 years.  Hale Berry also stars as another woman who changes her personality sometimes, and sometimes doesn't.If you are concerned though about plot, don't be.  The action in the film sustains it throughout, whether it's the opening at the bank, or the sensational finale, this film hold up the summer treatment, despite the usual flaws from director Sena.  And now, for the guys, there is of course the well known Berry breast scene. And yes, it is glorious.  I could've left the theater right after that, and it was as good of a moment as any other Berry has done in movie.  Not to discredit her, but with this first nudity scene, she is really going places not seen before (know what I mean, wink wink).  Anyway, the film itself is good anyway, with some really good dialogue thrown into it that seems like it's from a different movie (Travolta's excellent first monologue, for example).  Don Cheadle also stars.  B+",Swordfish
10,wes-connors,"Log on, Tap in, and Drop Down for Action with Two Boobs and a Babe",5,6 September 2010,"After a stint in prison, handsome computer hacker Hugh Jackman (as Stanley Jobson) wants to see his daughter, but her scummy mother warns him to stay away from the girl. While working on his golf swing, Mr. Jackman is contacted by sexy Halle Barry (as Ginger Knowles), who offers Jackman an assignment hacking a billion dollar account called ""Swordfish"" for home-grown terrorist John Travolta (as Gabriel Shear). If he can hack into the billions, Jackman is promised $10,000,000 and access to his daughter. Jackman, who apparently works best while receiving oral sex ordered by Mr. Travolta at gunpoint, accepts the job.Director Dominic Sena opens with Travolta talking what turns out to be an action-packed Los Angeles hostage situation.Then, the story flashes back four days, and is told chronologically. The opening is nicely done, and the film is filled with action. The story doesn't hang together quite as well, however. You're left filling in some of the blanks by yourself. For example, if Jackman didn't shoot down a certain helicopter, just figure it would have hovered around town until someone did. By the way, this is the film for which Ms. Berry received a $500,000 bonus for exposing her breasts. That's $250,000 per boob, folks, and it's over quickly. Conversely, Travolta was paid $20,000,000 and keeps his shirt on. Go figure.***** Swordfish (6/4/01) Dominic Sena ~ Hugh Jackman, John Travolta, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle",Swordfish
11,michaelRokeefe,Just break the code: there is government money to be had.,6,4 January 2002,"Action... explosive action. Clever script. Eye popping special effects. A strong cast, but too much confusion in following the story line. A highly successful computer hacker(Hugh Jackman)is coerced to help a ruthless spy(John Travolta)steal billions of unused government monies obtained in an old DEA drug operation. Don Cheadle is the run ragged FBI agent trying to spoil the by-computer hijacking. Sam Shepard has a small role as a corrupt Senator. The alluring Halle Berry is supposedly an undercover DEA agent whose purpose in the whole procedure is not clear cut.If you are looking for a good escape from reality; this flick will give you several big bangs for your buck. It is good to see Travolta play a clever, bad ass thug. Some of his best work in a long time. And for the first time, Miss Berry appears topless on screen; and in other various degrees of undress...so nice my eyes hurt. Vinnie Jones is impressive as a strong arm enforcer. Rough and ready entertainment worth your time.",Swordfish
12,bevo-13678,Cigars,10,10 October 2020,This came on the telly after the footy one night. I was pretty munted by then but I'm sure it could've been ok. Even though Travolta is a dick.,Swordfish
13,Scarecrow-88,Swordfish,5,6 September 2014,"Swordfish is the kind of slippery thriller that just couldn't possibly hold up to close scrutiny. Particularly the ending, with police in hot pursuit of Travolta (his name is irrelevant in the film since his identity changes considering what his black ops needs of him), as he is on-board a bullet-riddled bus carrying hostages with bombs attached to them and mercenaries on his dime being carried by a chopper over LA. Super-hacker Hugh Jackman has been paroled, working a crappy job in a Texas oil field, missing his daughter (the mother is married to a porn producer who she even works in films for!), and is approached by the seductive Halle Berry on returning to his skills for a mysterious benefactor played by Travolta (wearing a long hair piece similar to his character in Pulp Fiction) in LA. Believing 10 million and the return of his daughter to him are worthy investments in hacking into a sophisticated network for Travolta, Hackman soon realizes he's in over his head as the very man paying him is a governmental rogue agent using extreme terrorism against terrorists threatening the American way of life. Berry is kind of Travolta's go-to girl for convincing Jackman to proceed in hacking. Anyway, soon governmental cyber-agent Don Cheadle wants Hackman to help him nail Travolta. Then there's Sam Shepard as a senator who has been in cahoots with Travolta but decides he must be put down due to the FBI catching wind of their terrorist activities. So there's a lot of cars after each other, machine guns causing carnage, and dead bodieslots of dead bodies. Oh, yeah, Halle shows her tits. That bit of info will important for some folks. The film paints Travolta as this complex character that seems to believe in the American ideal of keeping it protected by any means necessaryand no one can stop him from making damn sure he holds onto this philosophy with all the bombs and guns needed to assure his success. Misdirection as used by Travolta describing Houdini's talent as a magician to Hackman right before blasting Shepard's gunmen while speeding through LA and that can best explain the labyrinthine plot that concludes as you might figureTravolta has used identities and escape plans so many times, he is the black ops Houdini in the flesh. It's hard to necessarily root for Jackman since hackers are the anti-Christ but he's got a daughter he cares about soWHY NOT?!?! He does question Travolta's ethics (a hacker questioning someone else's ethics, haha!), and serves as a hero close to the villain (or is he a villain? the film bothers with such questions) who might can stop him, so I guess we have to get behind someone, right? My personal favorite scene has Jackman trying to escape from Cheadle and his agents by leaping off a cliff and down the canyon below the suburbs on the outskirts of LA...Cheadle follows (as does another agent, while the third agent gives chase in the company vehicle) and they seem to be falling forever as they kick up dust, aching from the dirt and rock that seems to fail to halt their descent.",Swordfish
14,preppy-3,Stupid but fun,8,25 June 2001,"A hacker named Stanley (Hugh Jackman) is hired by the mysterious Gabriel (John Travolta) to break into a computerized bank file that contains billions of dollars and steal it.  There's more to it, but plot is not the primary concern of this film.  What is front and center is action--car chases, crashes, explosions, gun fights, etc etc.  The plot's ""logic"" disappears half way through, but the action never lets up.  It's loud, fast, furious and lots of fun.  Surprisingly, the acting is also good considering the actors had nothing to work with.  Travolta is OK...not great, just OK. He's done better.  Jackman is wonderful as Stanley--handsome, buff and full of charisma--very talented.  Halle Berry is also very good in a supporting role--yes, she bares her breast and yes, it's worth it.

15,LeonLouisRicci,Not a Bunch of Horse FeathersMore of a Guilty Pleasure.,7,23 December 2013,"Forget all the Snooty Critics, this is a Fun Movie that is Eye Candy Elitism at its Mind-Numbing best. All Flash and Frenzy with a dash of Down and Dirty this Thing plays with the Audience as it plays out its Outlandish Plot. Star Power and Powerful State of the Art (2001) SFX make this a very Watchable Guilty Pleasure.A trap that is imminent in Movies, a heavy inclusion of Computers and the constantly changing Operating Systems, is glaring and the Movie relies way too much on this Anachronistic Pitfall. These Things are almost always Outdated before the Movie even hits the Multiplexes and by the Time it is released on Disc it can seem Laughably Lame. Computer Capabilities and Performance have a Shelf Life of about a Minute and a Half.But Technobabble aside, this is nothing more than one more of those that are made to sell tickets and popcorn.

16,poolandrews,Great Hollywood action flick.,7,21 April 2008,"Swordfish starts as Texan oil field worker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) is approached by a woman named Ginger Knowles (Halle Berry), Stanley was once the greatest computer hacker in the world & despite not touching a computer keyboard in nearly two years he still is. Ginger offers Stanley $100,000 to speak with her employer, a shadowy man named Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) who lives in Los Angeles. Gabriel offers Stanley ten million dollars if he can crack an encrypted Governmnet bank account in which there is fifteen billion dollars of seized drug money, ten million dollars is a hell of a carrot & Stanley eventually agrees but as the bullets start to fly he realises that he finds himself in a dangerous situation that will either get him killed or sent to prison...This American Australian co-production was directed by Dominic Sena & is a cracking big budget Hollywood action flick that I freely admit I enjoyed a fair bit. The script by co-producer Skip Woods has it's good & bad points, first the good. It has a good pace & never gets boring, it has lots of stand out spectacular action set-pieces that are silly & very improbable but at the same time highly exciting, satisfying & over-the-top, the character's are reasonable & I liked the motives behind Gabriel's heist. It wasn't quite as clear cut as in many films, it's not quite as black and white as I am sure many might share his sentiments that when terrorists strike we should retaliate with even more extreme actions. His logic of 'if they kill one American tourist we kill one of their entire villages' has a certain something to it, while it's undoubtedly not the right thing to think or say deep down inside many of us I suspect we have all had such thoughts & ideas especially after some of the truly horrendous terrorist acts committed against Western society. I liked the end too, I liked the way Gabriel basically got away with it & again most Hollywood films surely would have had the hero kill the bad guy in a very traditional climactic fight sort of way. Now the bad. I thought most of the character's were one dimensional & the ever awful Halle Berry's in it but my biggest gripe with Swordfish is a lot of exposition surrounding the plot was unfathomable to me. I don't consider myself computer illiterate at all but some of the terminology used just went straight over my head, for example terms like Hydra's, dropping bombs through the back door, worms, 128 bit encryption's & the like just didn't click with me. It had the unwanted effect of pulling me out of the film & left me feeling somewhat detached from it. During these bits I just didn't really know what was being said or understand it, unless your a computer genius I doubt many would.Director Sena does a good job, the action scenes are suitably overblown & spectacular. From car chases to shoot outs to explosions to a bus being picked up by a helicopter & flown across Los Angeles there's plenty of high octane action to take your mind off an otherwise somewhat shallow script that tries to paper over some of the cracks with computer jargon that really doesn't mean a whole lot. Swordfish was withdrawn from cinemas in late 2001 after the Septmeber 11 terror attacks on New York & Washington & it's easy to see why with it's story based around terrorists. The violence isn't that graphic but there's still some fights & plenty of good old fashioned death.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 Swordfish has that big budget Hollywood polish about it & is very well made. There's some good stylish photography & plenty of macho posturing. The acting is decent from a good cast, Travolta doesn't have that much to do but he makes a good villain although I hate Helle Berry as an actress. I think she's useless but luckily her presence isn't enough to ruin the film, her semi-nude scene proves she has horrible breast's as well.Swordfish is a very enjoyable Hollywood action flick, apart from the awful Berry the cast is good & while the story is a little shallow at times the plentiful action scenes make up for it. Definitely well worth a look in my opinion.",Swordfish
17,lastliberal,"Pretty Impressive, huh?",7,21 April 2007,"Take one of the absolute hottest women in Hollywood and match her with Hugh Jackman and bad boy John Travolta and you have a hit right? Well, Halle Berry was definitely hot in this movie and Jackman was cool, but we got a Razzie-nominated performance from Travolta to keep this from being a better action movie. Even the yummy Drea de Matteo couldn't save this.This was a good action film and had some dramatic special effects, but the greatest effect was seeing Halle Berry again. She did a great job in a movie that was dominated by Travoolta and Jackman.",Swordfish
18,Calicodreamin,What?,4,8 June 2021,"I have no idea what this movie was about, the storyline and dialogue were both disjointed.

19,Boba_Fett1138,An action movie that desperately tries to be more.,6,4 August 2005,"""Swordfish"" certainly ain't no bad movie but the way they tried to give this movie many layers and deeper meanings and tried to explain the motives of the main 'villain' is totally pointless and makes this movie drift away from what it should had been; Some mindless action-fun. A movie like this should need no mind work.Definitely nothing wrong with the talent involved in this movie. Dominic Sena isn't a bad action director and the movie has a wonderful visual style, also thanks to cinematographer Paul Cameron, who has a great style. If you have seen ""Man on Fire"" and ""Collateral"" you know what I mean. Also nothing wrong with the cast here; John Travolta, Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry together in one movie, is the dream for every filmmaker.Then were did it go wrong? Well, it went wrong with the script. It tries to give the movie so many more layers and deeper meanings that it distracts from the action and make this movie even a slow one at times. Yes, luckily the movie still has some good action sequences and hey it has got John Travolta as the bad guy who is always at his best in roles like these but it all ain't enough to make this movie just slightly above average.Also the whole hacking concept is original but also kind of ridicules, this is probably due to the graphic effects of all those computer programs. They literally tried to show graphically by computer images on the screen how an hacker works. This of course is not how it works in real-life and takes away some of the credibility of the movie that obviously tried to create a realistic atmosphere.Yes it certainly is a watchable movie but it's not really a very entertaining one.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Swordfish
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,90 minutes that I'll never get back,1,20 July 2004,"This film is horrible. From start to finish. I actually had trouble sitting through the whole thing, since it failed to accomplish the fairly simple task of impressing someone as entertainment-wise open-minded as myself for something as short as 90 minutes. I actually almost fell asleep, even though I watched this at about 5 PM. It fails to inspire anything other than excruciating boredom. I wasn't excited or entertained for a minute(or a second, for that matter) of this putrid garbage. It so testosterone-filled that it's ridiculous; every single scene has guns, cars, babes, alcohol or sex. Some have all of them. Every single female character is a slut or a victim, or both. Every single actor does a horrible job. Every single character is awfully written, and a cliché or a stereotype. Or both, if possible. The film is so cliché-ridden that you can't imagine it if you haven't seen it. A lot of it is also just blatant rip-off of far superior films, among others, The Matrix. The most obvious is the special effects and the hacking parts. But I also noticed that they copied the ultra-cool mobile phones from The Matrix. If you ask me, the directors just jealous of Matrix, as he obviously can't make action movies himself(I haven't seen 60 seconds, but I've heard nothing but bad things about it). And while I'm on the subject, the hacking; no one really knows exactly what hacking is, right? So how to show it... have someone explain it? Show someone operating a keyboard? Maybe show the screen as the text commands are written on it? No, I know, lets just show Hugh Jackman sitting at a set of 6-7 screens(I think, I wasn't paying attention), yelling variations of ""yes, yes, no"", drinking, smoking and *occasionally* actually typing at the keyboard, while a horrible techno beat is pumping noisily in the background, and the gullible audience will think that he's ""hacking"", since they don't know what hacking is. Not that the filmmakers have the slightest idea what hacking is, either, though. And about the soundtrack, why is it all just bad techno-beats, instead of something that actually evokes emotion, you know, apart from the unbearable pain in our ears. I guess they figured, ""hey, everything else in the film is so unbearably, unforgivably bad, why not make the soundtrack accordingly?"". The dialog is some of the worst in modern cinema(hell, who am I kidding, in the history of cinema). I can only think of one or two movies containing worse lines and worse written dialog, and this one screws it up further, by having every single character crack jokes; in the immortal words of Bart Simpson: ""Everybody's a comedian!"" Also, every single actor does such a lousy job that you'll yell out loud at the screen ""OH come on!"". That is, unless you have an insane amount of self-control, in which case you might be able to keep yourself from mocking the film aloud. The clichés of this film is unbearable. You've got the FBI guy who ""doesn't play by the rules"", you've got the boss who ""knows that every situation, especially a hostage situation, can be solved by uncoordinated violence"", you've even got the hero who ""doesn't give a shit"". Hell, you even get the mean bastard who is the villain's right hand but never actually does anything but spout one-liners that would make Arnold himself cringe and beg for mercy. The film has the most standard, boring and pointless action scenes you'll ever see in your entire life. I've seen commercials that were more exciting. No, actually, I've seen home-videos that were more entertaining, better filmed, more interesting and less boring. The action consists of a few chase scenes, that serve as an amazing sleeping aid, a single car-chase that was more pointless than just about every single other car-chase I've ever seen. I think a few scenes involved shooting, too, but I'm not entirely sure we ever saw more than guns being loaded and cocked, which, I guess, will fully satisfy some action-craving men, but definitely not me. I've seen the director of this pointless waste of film quoted as saying that ""this film would be better than The Matrix, and the sequels to it"". What the hell was he on? Just another sign of the idiot not being able to cope with The Matrix's success. The special effects are decent, and obviously ripped from The Matrix(where they are much better made, as well). The plot is patched together from a bunch of much better action films, and is so full of holes that you have to wonder whether most of the crew was half asleep while making this film, since they apparently didn't notice. The point of the film is apparently, that you can do what you want, everything you want, as long as you're working for a good cause, and, of course, you're using misdirection so no one will know what you're up to. The way the film tries to justify terrorist acts committed by the villain by saying that they're ""saving other people's lives"" is complete bull. It's a common known fact that ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"". What good will it do to kill off other terrorists, if you're acting like a terrorist yourself? That is some of the most hypocritical bull that I've heard from Hollywood. The film is repetitive and predictable. All the way through, you know how it's going to end, unless you're not paying any attention, which I can't really blame you. The film is utterly pointless. The one high point it has, is that it does have Halle Berry topless, in one scene, for about five seconds(at best). Now, is that worth renting/buying/watching the film for? NO! Not at all. You want to see her breasts, go on-line, find a picture site. There's plenty of 'em. Don't waste your time on this piece of trash, under any circumstances. You want good action, look elsewhere. You want any sort of quality in a film, look elsewhere. You want to see Berry's breasts... look on the web, or one of the other films where she(apparently, I haven't seen them) also goes topless, but whatever you do, stay as far away from this crap as humanly possible. If you're going to watch this movie, watch it for free to make fun of it, watch it if you're going to make a movie yourself and you want to know what you're definitely *not* supposed to put in a movie, or simply watch it to see the decline in cinema. But don't watch it to see a good movie. I hope this review is read by as many as possible, and I hope that those who read it will heed my advice and don't watch it. I want to save as many people from this trash as I can. I don't recommend this film to anybody, unless they're dying to see Berry's breasts, and don't mind sitting through this garbage. Avoid this like the plague. 1/10",Swordfish
21,neil-476,If only the start could have been sustained,7,25 April 2008,"This film has a great start. Travolta delivers a smug but intelligent, knowing, movie-reverential monologue, following which there is a terrific action sequence, then the rest of the film is told in flashback.Which is where the wonderful sharpness of the opening comes to an end. What follows is a relatively standard action suspense thriller, wildly improbable in many respects, and with an ending which is so full of unexplained ""Get out of Jail free"" moments that you watch the closing credits thinking, ""Huh?"" There's a vastly improbable sequence where Jackman is running down a cliff (honest, guv), followed by a batch of secret service blokes, and it takes them about 10 minutes to reach the bottom. Which probably explains how the bloke who stayed with the car got there before them.Travolta's brilliant getaway plan involves hooking a bus up to a helicopter and flying it to freedom over the city (because, of course, the police don't have any helicopters of their own - at least, according to Swordfish they don't - all pursuit by the authorities is strictly ground-based).Which is not to say that there aren't good things to savour.Travolta as the heavy is an acquired taste, but it's one I've acquired. You can feel his physical enjoyment coming off the screen.Jackman oozes sincerity in every frame he's in.The girl playing his daughter is good.Miss Berry is, as always, hot, and more so in the underwear scene than in the display of boobage scene.This film scores a 7 because I'm a bloke.

22,Uriah43,A World-Class Hacker Over His Head,6,25 August 2016,"""Stanley"" (Hugh Jackman) is a world-class hacker who has recently been tried in a court-of-law and put on a probation which not only requires him to notify the law prior to leaving the state of Texas but also forbids him to use any computer devices as well. Not only that, but his wife has left him and taken their daughter to Los Angeles. Things are pretty bad. As a result he settles for a low-wage job in Midland and does the best that he can. However, one day a beautiful woman named ""Ginger"" (Halle Berry) comes to his home and offers him a sizable portion of money just to simply meet with her employer. Although he is reluctant at first he realizes that he cannot turn down the money being offered and goes to Los Angeles for the meeting. It's then that he meets a mysterious person named ""Gabriel"" (John Travolta) who essentially makes him an offer that he cannot refuse. What Stanley doesn't realize, however, is that both Gabriel and Ginger have secrets which are yet to be revealed and that the job is much more dangerous than he initially suspects. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film mainly because of the action and suspense. Additionally, the presence of Halle Berry certainly didn't hurt either. Unfortunately, the plot lacked the necessary realism which resulted in some incredibly unbelievable scenes. Only in Hollywood. Yet in spite of it all I still found this film to be somewhat entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Swordfish

It opens with a great monologue by John Travolta about bad Hollywood filmmaking until the film quickly reveals its real purpose and that is to be a bad Hollywood film itself. Travolta plays a terrorist who needs Hugh Jackman to help him steal billions of dollars from a bank. Jackman plays the world's most dangerous computer hacker who is trying to go straight so that he can see his daughter. Mindless action and an implausible escape in the conclusion. Director Dominic Sena can handle action but screenplays are not the strength here. He previously made another stinker called Gone in Sixty Seconds. Travolta seems to be trying to repeat his winning Pulp Fiction success to no avail. Jackman does well in the one performance that seems rounded. Halle Berry's role consists of revealing her breast at just the right moment. She is there to seduce but the joke is on her. Don Cheadle plays a cop who pursues Jackman. Cheadle does what he can with the straight forward material. Sam Shepard plays the Senator and that is about it for him.

25,Mr-Fusion,All Flash and no Dash,4,5 April 2011,"Halle Berry made gossip headlines ten years ago when she agreed to do a nude scene for a $500,000 bonus. Naturally, the studio hoped the gossip would serve to hype the film and result in a big box office gross. It worked. That movie was 'Swordfish', a high-gloss actioner from the people that brought you 'The Matrix' and 'Gone in 60 Seconds'. John Travolta is Gabriel Shear, leader of a corrupt counter-terrorist unit with eyes on $9.5 billion currently under lock-and-key with the DEA. He needs the best hacker in the business to bypass the encrypted bank account and free up the cash. Enter super-hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman), once arrested for hacking the FBI database and forbidden to even touch a computer. Jobson's daughter is currently in his pornstar ex-wife's custody (Drea de Matteo) and won't let Jobson near her. He can't afford those pesky legal fees to win custody, and that ten million Shear offers sure looks tasty. Meanwhile, the fed who busted Jobson (Don Cheadle) gets wind and brings some unnecessary heat to the table. And then, seemingly as an afterthought, there's Halle Berry, a mysterious woman in Shear's employ (they may or may not be an item) who exists mostly to strike seductive poses and look hot.There's a (pretty sure it's unintentionally) hilarious scene fairly early on in the film with Cheadle and Jackman involved in an on-foot chase. Jackman, coming to a fence with nothing beyond but a sheer embankment down to the ocean, hurls himself over the fence and proceeds to slide, tumble and grunt in pain all the way down. Cheadle follows right behind him. Both men arrive at the bottom (fully ambulatory, mind you) with ripped suit jackets and proceed to have a conversation.That scene gives you a pretty good idea as to what the rest of the film is like. It's loud, it's dumb, and it's entirely a style-over-substance affair. There are gunfights and explosions that are ripped directly from 'The Matrix', while the car chases reek of 'The Fast and the Furious'. Exposition scenes are kept ""moving"" by a lack of camera stability. Effects scenes are slowed down so that every dollar of the budget is right there on screen.Travolta is stifled by the ""bad guy as straight man"" role of Shear. He chews none of the scenery (as he did in 'Broken Arrow' and 'Face/Off') in this film, instead playing it innocently. In case we forget just who the bad guy is, he has the requisite evil facial hair (though the soul patch seems a bit cheap).Jackman and Cheadle both handle their own, but both men are out of their element here. Even they can't elevate a film that seems to exist solely to distribute paychecks.Then there's Halle Berry. That notorious topless scene (still used to advertise the film, even on the Netflix sleeve) comes out of nowhere, and lasts maybe five seconds (all told). It's the epitome of gratuitous nudity - she puts down her book, and there they are! But then that scene tends to reflect the entire movie: expensive, lots of hype, and ultimately fruitless.4/10",Swordfish

27,JamesHitchcock,One of those which gets it wrong,4,29 January 2010,"Those who come to ""Swordfish"" in the expectation that it will be a natural history documentary about the species Xiphias gladius are likely to be disappointed. The only connection between the film and the fish with which it shares its name is that at one point the word ""swordfish"" is used as a computer password. (Apparently this is an old joke going back to a Marx Brothers sketch). The main character, Stanley Jobson, is a skilled computer hacker who has recently been released from jail. Stanley is approached by a young woman named Ginger Knowles who has a proposition for him. She wants him to use his hacking skills to help her boss, a man named Gabriel Shear. It turns out that Gabriel wants Stanley to hack into a top secret bank account to steal several billion dollars from an illegal US Government slush fund. If Stanley succeeds in this enterprise he will receive a reward of ten million dollars. As Stanley is living in poverty in a run-down trailer in rural Texas, he is more than happy to take on the assignment, especially as he is badly in need of money to fund his battle for custody of his daughter, currently living with his alcoholic porn star ex-wife.The film garnered some notoriety when it first came out on the grounds that it contains Halle Berry's first nude scene. The lovely Halle certainly looks stunning throughout, even in those scenes where she keeps her clothes on, but there are few other reasons to watch this film. Hugh Jackman makes a charismatic leading man, but charisma alone is not always enough to secure the success of a movie, and it struck me that Stanley, like Jason Statham's character in ""The Transporter"", was a hero worthy of a much better film than this one. John Travolta, as Gabriel, was insufficiently menacing to make an effective villain, and I was disappointed to see Halle Berry, who is undoubtedly a talented actress, appearing in something that appeared to stretch her talents so little. Mind you, ""Swordfish"" is by no means the only film where she has been guilty of this; indeed, it is not even her worst film. (That must be ""B*A*P*S""). Although the main character is a computer nerd, the film-makers clearly realised that computer nerdishness is not enough in itself to make a film interesting, and ""Swordfish"" quickly turns into a full-blown action thriller complete with car chases and spectacular explosions. It has been compared to the James Bond films, but it lacks their wit and style, and the plot is more complex than the Bonds, even at their most intricate. It is really a cross between an action thriller and a ""twist"" thriller, the sort of film where we can never be sure whether any of the characters are what they claim to be or what their motives are. (Gabriel, for instance, claims that he needs the money to fund the operations of the ruthless underground anti-terrorist group of which he is a member, but this may not be the whole truth). The ""twist"" thriller is, however, a difficult genre to get right, and ""Swordfish"", which I often found confusing to follow and where the acting and characterisation often seemed inadequate, is one of those which gets it wrong. 4/10",Swordfish

30,dromasca,good if you just take it as entertainment,7,21 July 2008,"I am wondering where the career of director Dominic Sena goes. After having done 'Kalifornia' and 'Gone in sixty seconds' he did 'Swordfish' and then just seemed to disappear. I am curios to see his latest 'Whiteout' which seems to have been released in June, but I heard nothing about it.Anyway, he is a director who really knows how to direct action movies, and none of the three films I mentioned bored me, on the contrary, they were quite well done, had pace, enjoyed the participation of good actors - overall good entertainment. 'Swordfish' is no exception to all these, on the other hand one can ask a few questions about credibility of many of the scenes, as well as about the moral values of the character played by John Travolta, but overall when you have Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry near Travolta in the cast you cannot go too wrong.

The film opens up with an intriguing monologue from John Travolta about how movies are too typical, which led me to expect that this movie was really going for something different. Sadly, it ended up being very much like what Travolta was talking about, predictable. The cast is terrific, but there heart was not in the right place. There is a sense from the four main cast members that they were merely offered a nice contract to do this film, their is no feeling of them being inspired to take these roles whatsoever. It did not take any risks in plot development, every beat is expected, there is no moments that will its audience, there are very few surprises. A film can try to do something different with its direction and pacing, but that is not enough if the story is dull. Predictable and tedious, Swordfish is better off to be missed.

32,The-Sarkologist,An action Thriller in the style of The Usual Suspects,7,26 January 2012,"After watching X-men, I suddenly realised that there was this heaps cool movie that also starred Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman, namely this one. Swordfish is an action/suspense movie that does not end the way that one would expect it to end, that is the good guy ends up beating the bad guy. The movie opens near the end with Gabriel (John Travolta) telling some police officers about Hollywood movies and how real life does not end like a Hollywood Movie. He then leaves the coffee shop, goes the the bank that he is robbing, and sends a hostage out. The police, as is expected, ignores his threats, and attempts to grab the hostage, and the claymore mine strapped to the hostage's chest explodes sending ballbearings flying everywhere. Pretty cool opening if I do say so myself.However, that is near the end of the movie, and immediately after that scene, we are transported four days earlier to see how Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) landed up on the wrong side of a bank robbery (meaning that he was with the bank robbers rather than the hostages). Jobson is a guy that is trying to get his life back in order. While we do not know too much about how he got into that position, what we do know is that he was considered to be America's most dangerous hacker, and has been banned from ever touching a computer again.Where bad guys are concerned though, it does not matter what the government has to say because it is irrelevant. They don't care if you end up spending the rest of your life in gaol because you have a skill that they want, and they have leverage against Jobson. A part of his parole is that he is not allowed to see his daughter again. There is a catch though, his ex-wife has married a porn king, and while he is forbidden access to his daughter, he is torn over the fact that the government has turned a blind eye to the occupation of her new father. Gabriel knows this, and uses this leverage to get him on board.At first it seems all innocent, but when bullets start flying, he suddenly learns that Gabriel's understanding of morality is flexible at best. We really don't know much about who Gabriel is, or where he came from. Some hints are dropped in the movie, but we never know the truth beyond this mysterious character. The FBI know of him, but really do not know what he is capable of, that is until he robs a bank.There is also Ginger (Halle Berry) but once again we know very little about her. We know that she is close to Gabriel, but we don't know how close. There are some hints that she is just another cop trying to get dirt on Gabriel, but it turns out that this is not the case. This movie is really all about misdirection, the way a stage magician performs his magic, namely by distracting the audience, and then pulling his stunt. It is clear, once we get to the end, that it appears that Gabriel has set everything up perfectly. However, like Gabriel says at the beginning of the movie, that life is not like a movie, and in the words of John Steinbeck, the best laid plans of mice and men are apt to go astray.",Swordfish
33,slightlymad22,Enjoyable Performance From Hugh Jackman,7,23 December 2014,"On paper the casting here looked enough to guarantee big box office returns. Even if John Travolta has come off the back of the biggest flop of his career with ""Battlefield Earth"" Hugh Jackman was following up his first stint as Wolverine in ""X-Men"" likewise Halle Berry was following up the same movie. While Don Cheadle was in the Oscar winning ""Traffic"", Vinnie Jones was in ""Snatch"" and the remake of ""Gone in 60 Seconds"". But for some reason it just doesn't come together. Plot In A Paragraph: Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) is trying to access information that is locked inside a complicated computer system that contains mountains of government secrets - and money. With the help of his companion Ginger (Halle Berry) he hires Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman), a desperate computer expert, who is trying to stay clean to help him hack into the system. I'll get what I dislike out of the way first. Halle Berry's much hyped first topless scene looks very forced, and looks to only be in the movie for publicity purposes. John Travolta gives an awful performance and following ""The Punisher"" the last movie I watched him in, this is another hint that ""Pulp Fiction"" was a fluke. Tate Donovan is an awful actor, but thank funny his role is small. I'm not sure why Vinnie Jones is here, as I don't recall him having any dialogue, except an awful bit at the end. Despite a short running time, the plot is drawn out, and seems to have too much going on at the same time. Where the movie works is Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry.

John Travolta is equally good as the antagonist, Gabriel. For some reason he was named 'worst actor' for his role, but I thought he did the bad guy persona with flair and a sense of charm, while the character is also a flamboyant, ruthless criminal. Halle Berry stars as Ginger, the only character with ulterior motives. She was the sex symbol, and they used every excuse to flaunt her body - mostly uncalled for and out of place.The film dishes up a lot of IT stuff I didn't understand, but it was nevertheless presented in an entertaining manner.

John Tavolta is back in form, after a couple of turkeys, as Gabriel Shear an international terrorist who claims to be protecting the American way of life, but is he? Hugh Jackman plays Stanley Jobson a paroled computer hacker who is drawn into a complex plot by Shear to rob the American government of some $9 billion dollars by hacking into the World Bank's computer system. Jackman is disillusioned at first but through clever manipulation by Travolta and Co., becomes a part of the plot. The lovely Halle Berry appears as Ginger, Shear's ""assistant"" who may or may not be who she appears to be. Berry, by the way, displays some of her ample charms over the course of the film.

One of them is Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) who is promised $10.000.000 and his daughter's safe return if he can break and hack into the super guarded computer to retrieve the money. Helping, Don Chedel is voluptuous and riveting super model, Halley Berry who brings all of her delicious form to the big screen. The film erupts with a hair-raising, dynamically driven explosion which then launches itself into an equally captivating film. Keep your eyes on the dynamic players as they combine to create a classic. ****",Swordfish
42,dfranzen70,Dull Seafood,4,20 November 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The term ""no-brainer"" usually refers to a decision so simple that any fool can make it correctly. It's also applicable to this movie, as one is probably better off not having a brain when watching it - or, if one is in possession of a brain, it'll be all mushy and spongy afterwards.Can you see where I'm going with this? Swordfish is profoundly stupid, with profoundly stupid characters doing profoundly stupid things. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence.  While you watch it, your brain turns to jello.Now, granted, this happens with a lot of current action movies, but this one sinks so quickly and so authoritatively into the great abyss of suckitude that you can hardly pause to catch your breath. Oh, but wait - it's not so exciting that you actually lose your breath.Gabriel Shear (John Travolta, sporting yet another goofy hairdo), is a megalomaniacal hacker with oodles of cash. He's reclusive but dangerous; he hires world-famous hackers to break into bank accounts and steal money electronically. He's ruthless, too, caring more about his single goal (which is thankfully revealed midway through the movie) than about other people's lives, no matter how many are lost.Shear picks up ex-hacker Stanley (Hugh Jackman), who went to prison for hacking into the FBI and setting back their computer system two years. Stanley's forbidden from seeing his evercute daughter by his trailer-trash, porn-star ex-wife, and he lacks the cash to fight the custody in court. Can you see where this is leading?Shear sends one of his top lieutenants, Ginger (Halle Berry) to pick up Stanley, and she convinces him to sign on. It's a simple gig - he gets $100,000 just for meeting Gabriel, and he can walk away if he doesn't like the deal he'll be offered. Right. Like anyone in a movie like this would say no to that. If Stanley were really bright, he'd sense right off that Gabriel is a Bad Guy - people don't just give $100,000 away for a meeting, you know. But Stanley's not too swift, so he goes along. Presumably he also goes because Halle Berry asked him nicely.At any rate, Stanley accepts the cash to go visit Shear, who needs someone to break an encrypted network in 60 seconds. I'm not going to bog down this review with technical lingo about how Stanley accomplishes it, mainly because I have no idea. The way hacking is almost always portrayed on the silver screen is by having one disheveled (usually young, although Stanley's in his early to mid-thirties) hacker type really, really, really fast, hitting a million keys in about 15 seconds, then dramatically hitting ""enter"" and looking triumphant. So Stanley has to pull off this kind of feat, under enormous pressure (in more ways than one).
Now, by this point you're supposed to be sympathizing with Stanley. He's the good guy, right? He's doing this against his will, right? And he only wants to see his daughter, right? The screenwriters don't leave much out when making Stanley out to be a solid Good Guy. Heck, the only reason he cracked the FBI computer was out of a sense of goodwill. So he's a hacker with a cause.Ordinarily, you'd think a movie about hacking into computers would be dull - and it would be if all we had to look at was a computer screen. So Shear crashes some cars, takes hostages, commandeers a bus and a helicopter, and so on. It's kind of like Speed, but not ON speed, if you catch my drift. There's only so many of the same old crashes and smashes before the ol' consciousness decides to take an extended nap.On the video and DVD boxes for Swordfish, there's a warning about the violent content. The warning notes that the movie was made before September 11, 2001 and that there are some scenes in the movie that might be unsettling for some people. I'll save you the trouble - those scenes are when Gabriel acts like a terrorist overtly, rather than just subtly (you keep expecting him to do an evil laugh), and while it is possible people who lost loved ones on September 11 might feel a little uneasy with them, I think they'd react more strongly to the mind-numbing stupidity of the entire movie. Why focus on just a couple of scenes when the whole thing is like a giant drone bee, buzzing endlessly and saying nothing?A quick look at the cast. The good guys look good, the bad guys look bad. Ginger's on the fence - is she good? Is she bad? Is she both? Do we care? Halle Berry hasn't had a good role in a few years, but this one should have been easy for her. It just seems to me that the sole reason for having her there was for her to look pretty. She's not bad at that - and even does a gratuitous topless scene - but lends little in the way of substance to a movie that was already sorely lacking it. Jackman's not bad, but he's not nearly as commanding as he needs to be. It's another one of those movies where the criminal is a much stronger character and overwhelms that of the good guy.Parents: There's a lot of violence in the movie, and although most of it is cartoonish, some of it might hit too close to home. Most adults can see through violence in movies with no problem, separating it from reality, but kids don't always have that ability.",Swordfish
43,kevin_robbins,This is an action movie fans dream and a worthwhile watch,9,27 October 2021,"Swordfish (2001) is a movie currently in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows a hacker in a custody battle for his daughter. He is approached by an international thief about a job that is impossible to turn down based on the financial gain and his last desperations to keep his daughter. This movie is directed by Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds) and stars John Travolta (Pulp Fiction), Hugh Jackman (X-Men), Halle Berry (Gothika), Don Cheadle (Avengers), Sam Shepard (Black Hawk Down) and Vinnie Jones (Snatch). The storyline, while at times very unrealistic, is unique, stylish and entertaining. At the time this was released people were just understanding online capabilities so it was exciting to consider the realm of possibilities. Travolta was a fantastic villain and delivered his character to perfection. Berry was awesome and unpredictable and Jackman delivered a strong performance for him. The action scenes were awesome and the slow motion scenes were Matrix style entertaining. The movie starts and ends with a bang and is fun in between. This is an action movie fans dream and a worthwhile watch. I'd score this a solid 8.5/10.",Swordfish
44,meeza,Sword of OK!,6,12 June 2001,"I was sword of hoping that `Swordfish' would be in the same caliber of enticing and smart action films such as `Die Hard' and `Face Off.' However, what I found out that `Swordfish' is yet just another action-film fish in the sea. John Travolta stars as a rich tycoon who hires a computer hacker, played  by Hugh Jackman, to break into computer vaults- or something sword to that. I got a bit bored at times throughout the movie and fell asleep with the fishes or in this case the swordfishes in the sea (so, i missed the entire plot). I was definitely logged off to the formulaic screenplay. However, other parts of the film were not all bad. Halle Berry's topless scene was for sure of hard disk drive material. Also, you should `pass' the `word' that the special effects & the sound effects were especially outsounding. Because of these latter factors, I am sword of recommending `Swordfish' even though I may sword of regret it. *** Average",Swordfish

It's loaded with stars - Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and John Travolta (of all people) take the leads, with supporting shots from Don Cheadle and Vinnie Jones - but abysmally acted and thoroughly stiff, narrow and postured. The plot stabs in all directions without hitting anything substantial, more wrapped up in looking cool than going anywhere, and has its priorities so far out of whack that it actually expects the audience to deify the same character that's shown casually slaughtering dozens of innocents in the very first scene. As vapid, cheesy, overindulgent mind-numbers go, it's a real jewel.",Swordfish

Travolta opens the movie with a diatribe about Hollywood movies. As the camera pans back we see he is not a second rate professor of media studies but someone about rob a bank using hostages strapped with massive amounts of explosives and ball bearings. The film opened with his statement about Hollywood movies being sh*t. This doesn't quite meet his criteria but is so close by the end of the movie it will probably be the most quoted line. Swordfish is *the* current big action movie but ultimately unconvincing.",Swordfish
47,sauravjoshi85,A disappointing action thriller despite of some great star cast,4,5 January 2021,"Swordfish is an action thriller movie directed by Dominic Sena and stars John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Vinnie Jones and Late Sam Shepard.When I saw the names of John Travolta and Hugh Jackman I was expecting an edge of the seat action thriller but somewhat what I got was some bad acting and unconvincing screenplay.The plot of the movie is very scattered with a bad execution. It seems that the director was still not able to decide whether Travolta is an antagonist or protagonist as in the end he was shown killing terrorists with stolen money but also abducting innocent people and killing police officers which were totally confusing.Acting as mentioned earlier is average to bad and the biggest disappointment was Travolta, the movie was in huge limelight due to the topless scene of Halle Berry but that too is unconvincing. Jackman was best amongst them although still underused.Screenplay is poorly executed and is filled with some unnecessary car explosions and car chases, bullets flying on the road. The only positive aspect of the movie is it's fast screenplay. Climax of the movie is also unconvincing.Overall a fast paced action movie with a confusing plot, bad acting, poor screenplay and a confusing climax. The movie could be liked by hardcore action lovers who likes car chases, explosions, people killing people recklessly and isn't bothered about the plot of the movie.",Swordfish
48,NateWatchesCoolMovies,The very definition of slick,7,3 April 2016,"Swordfish tries so hard to be cool, and save for a few moments of smirking silliness, it is pretty goddamned cool. The early 2000's still carried lingering, reminiscent elements of the 90's, the super cyber hacker archetype included. The cyber hacker is played by two types of people: basement dwelling, Mountain Dew drinking chatter boxes and virile, sexy supermodels. The latter is employed here, personified by Hugh Jackman as Stanley, a sly devil who can hack into almost anything effortlessly, but has been caught and never allowed to touch a computer again. Enter Gabriel (John Travolta), a silver tongued arch villain out to steal all the money and priceless artifacts he can hope to ever own. Although Travolta isn't as truly off the rails as in some of his villain roles, the amiable charm he puts forth here is but a ruse to cloud the monster beneath. He's a very bad man, putting Stanley's loved ones in jeopardy and forcing him to work computer wizardry for ill gotten riches. Gabriel has a girlfriend named Ginger (Halle Berry, never sexier) who walks a moral tightrope between the two alpha males, torn between roguish indifference and and her conscience. Stanley is also hounded by an FBI Agent (Don Cheadle), with whom he has a tumultuous past. The film resists going completely by the motions, lulling you just to the border of entropy and then throwing something surprising from a direction you didn't look in. My favourite scene of the film shows Travolta giving a monologue on bank robbery etiquette, complete with a reference to Sydney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon, confirming the fact that this flick has a strong script to go with its pyrotechnics. He flexes his sonic directorial muscles in an especially extraordinary action sequence involving a bus and a helicopter that will seriously make your finger hover over the replay button. Vinnie Jones is an ambassador of cool, in a lively turn as Gabriel's head thug. Sam Shepherd has fun as a corrupt Senator. There's also fine work from Zachary Grenier, Tim Dekay, William Mapother, Rudolph Martin and Drea De Matteo. Director Dominic Sena comes from music video land, having also helmed the priceless Nic Cage Bruckheimer-fest Gone in 60 Seconds, as well as the fallout brilliant psycho road thriller Kalifornia. Here he doses the flash and sizzle of 60 seconds with the hard hitting violence of Kalifornia, presented in a story guaranteed to raise a pulse. It's also got pretty much the coolest poster of 2001. I dare you to find a cooler one, go ahead. Oh, and Travolta's manscaping here deserves its own spin off film.",Swordfish
49,davispittman,Kept my attention the entire way through,9,13 June 2016,"2001's Swordfish is definitely an entertaining movie. It's not exactly one for the snooty type of critics out there, but it is entertaining, well acted, and interesting. First of all, Halle Berry definitely brought her all to this project, she really owned her character, Ginger. She just fit the role, and brought life to it. I think the breast nudity scene with Berry and Jackman was interesting, because it kinda showed some of Ginger's characteristics, she definitely is a sexual character, and uses her sexuality to her advantage with different men. Hugh Jackman is a great professional actor, and he for sure does not disappoint in this film, he is smart, focused, likable, and looks good while doing it ;) lol. And then we come to John Travolta, by 2001, he had definitely proved himself as an A-list Hollywood actor. He did not disappoint as the main villain, he was mysterious, evil, and unpredictable, which is exactly what he needed to be in this film. The action scenes, which involve shooting, explosions, car crashes, and more are great and very well constructed, and entertaining to see on screen. Overall, the plot is intriguing, has it's twists and turns, and keeps your undivided attention the whole way through. I definitely recommend Swordfish. 9/10.",Swordfish

The acting & characterizations,   John Travolta is a convincing villain Halle Berry  proves to me that she is an actress of the very highest caliber,I did not see her Oscar winning role, but from her accomplished performance here, I can see  being one of our better actresses,  Hugh Jackman is just great as the put upon almost hero. He reminds me of some of the favorite actors  from my youth. Don Cheadle again gives another fine role as  an  government agent. There are  quite  few stunts in this film  & nearly all are exciting & well done, some are computer generated & classily done,Now  as to what  I did not  like------------ THE STORY. A convaluted plot, that  has been used so  many times, it has whiskers, I cant tell you the ending, but we have seen it many time.The other gripe I have (now this my be the tape--- I recorded it off Cable) the sound  was distorted at times.

John Travolta on his turn does the job for a senator in Washington. More I don't have to say about the story. It has some twists here and there and it is not always predictable, although sometimes it is a little far-fetched. The direction is good, especially in the action-sequences.

54,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Swordfish,7,18 May 2014,"What can you say about Swordfish. It's a rock em', sock em' guilty pleasure from the word go. It's got a look to it that the late Tony Scott would approve of. It's also sprinkled with some Jerry Bruckheimer star dust (these two weren't involved with the making of the film but their influence is there). So OK, let's not beat around the bush, this movie is so campy that you might have to build a fire and make some s'mores just to view it. It's got a little bit of everything for all types of movie patrons. A sort of dumbed down Matrix (1999) (I'm telling you, this is not an insult), there is plenty of action highlighted by slow mo explosions, Halle Berry showing off a little skin, Hugh Jackman playing a computer hacker (for all the technology lovers out there), John Travolta hamming it up as Gabriel, the ultimate terrorist jokester and Don Cheadle (always reliable) playing a flamboyant FBI agent. In retrospect, Swordfish is such a fast paced movie that the filmmakers don't want you to figure out how silly it is, they just want you to be entertained. Toward its over the top conclusion, Swordfish almost comes literally to a screeching halt. It kind of pulls the rug from underneath you. In truth, I love surprise endings and it's strange because up until the last ten minutes, I never thought this flick was the type of picture that would have that characteristic. I'm glad I was mistaken. To set the record straight, I go to the movies for two reasons, to escape from reality and be entertained. Swordfish, by hook or by crook, accomplished both.The story begins with Hugh Jackman's character (computer expert Stanley Jobson) being tapped for an illegal assignment by a renegade terrorist (Gabriel Shear, played with chilling banter by John ""notice my goatee"" Travolta). Jobson is considered one of the greatest hackers in the world and Shear wants him to hack into a government slush fund to steal possibly 9.5 billion dollars. Jackman's character is gonna pocket a huge cut from this job, so why not. He's trying to get custody of his loving daughter. And basically, he really needs the money to get a darn good lawyer. But hold up, Jobson is also being followed by L.A.'s finest because he's not suppose to be in California. He already went to prison for his criminal computer deeds a few years ago. This, among other saturated plot elements, sets the film running. Jackman's character is pulled in different directions and it's hard for him to concentrate on the task at hand. It certainly doesn't help when Halle Berry (undercover agent Ginger Knowles) distracts him to the point where he doesn't know who to trust.In its short running time (hour and a half plus change), Swordfish starts to reveal more and more plot twists, until the story just plain hits you over the head. The sense of urgency and immediacy that accompanies this film is downright scary. Some critics have called this movie silly and ludicrous (among other things), I say everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I liked it by cracky! I embraced the film even more as things got darker, especially with Travolta's character's motives. He actually says, ""I'm a murderer oh and much worse."" Throughout the film, he delivers a lot of speeches and chews more scenery than a rottweiler with a 72 ounce steak bone. The best part is that you think you know him, but the layers just keep coming (hint hint). Jackman, playing it a little more serious, gives Swordfish a heavy dramatic center. In this type of giddy, goofy movie in which stuff is blows up, it's not entirely needed, but I don't fault his efforts. This film and the X-Men movies kind of put him on the map.As with a lot of three star vehicles (including this one), their are a couple of oversights here and there. One of them might just be the screenplay by Skip Woods (screenwriter, A Good Day To Die Hard (2013)). Yeah, it's got a lot of juicy one liners that the actors can play with, but it lacks a more potent element. That would be attention to detail. Then you have the under utilization of actor Don Cheadle (agent J.T. Roberts). His character is fairly well established in the first and second act, but he gets put on the back burner toward the last 30-40 minutes. By the end, you pretty much forget that he's even in the movie.All and all, Swordfish is part bad boy cyber fantasy, part thriller, and part political drama. After viewing it, I attained this thought. Sometimes a film is so bad it's good. This one is so bad it's brilliant. It winks at the audience hoping that someone will wink back. It painstakingly begs you to like it. Don't worry guys, you've got a friend in me.",Swordfish
55,screenman,Seen Better.,6,21 April 2008,"ever since 'Pulp Fiction' revitalised his sagging career, John Travolta seems to have carved out a mini niche for himself as a slick and unflappable bad-ass. We've had 'Get Shorty', its follow-up 'Be Cool', 'Broken Arrow' and this 'Swordfish'. And maybe I've omitted one or two.Frankly, it's a one-dimensional pose I'm beginning to tire of. In this outing he plays a sort of legitimate master-villain or something. His brief is to destroy any potential threat to the dear old United States. And that appears to justify any amount of slaughter - of the very innocent American civilians he's presumably charged to protect. It would appear that mass murder of the public is only terrorism when foreign nationals do it. Which is why the movie begins with a 'hostage situation', in which he has strapped plastic explosives, ball-bearings, and proximity-detonators to any number of bank-clerks, all in the supposed name of obtaining funds for national defence. Sadly, it is a caricature of the sort of madness that now passes clandestine current, and legitimised our illegal seizure of Iraq. One of these hostages unfortunately detonates, and the slow-mo sequence and sound effects are extremely imaginative in their presentation. Gruesome as it may be, it is the best part of the movie. A great deal of thought went into it.After that, it's a downhill spiral into computer-crap and erotic stimulation. Halle Berry finally gets to expose herself, a condition which she would appear to have aspired since acting school - if she ever went to one. Like Sandra Bullock, she seems quietly obsessed by her own prettiness, as if that alone were an adequate substitute for ability. Frankly, I find her endless writhing, posturing, and sidelong glances a little wearisome. And how any male can be abashed by the sight of a small pair of knockers in this day and age is quite beyond me, though apparently not the director. Standing with legs akimbo in skimpy black briefs might be calculated to stimulate adolescent erections but says nothing to the production's credit. However, those who are prone to play with themselves whilst watching movies will presumably not object to her paralysingly self-conscious galvanics. At one point, a computer hacker is required to tap into a certain program whilst simultaneously being given a blow-job and having a gun pressed to his head. I kid you not.There's a great deal of crash-bang-wallop. Shoot-em-ups vie with car chases. It certainly tests your credulousness. And all the time there's the indomitable Mr Travolta with his self-assured smile, apparently gloating over his impending pay-cheque, real or imaginary. The ending is predictably preposterous, but by then you probably won't care too much. There's a lot to be said for the nice straightforward and believable movies of the 1950's. But go on; you've always wanted to see Halle Berry's tits. So, now's your chance. If only her acting skills were half as neat.",Swordfish
56,tomsview,"Cool, shiny and dangerous",8,9 May 2014,"Maybe I'm easily pleased, but I disagree with the majority of critics who blasted this film at the time of its release. For my money, this is the slickest action thriller since ""Heat"" and ""Ronin""; it just doesn't take itself as seriously.Stanley Robson (Hugh Jackman) is a computer hacker who has been banned from even going near a computer after serving two years in prison. He is approached by Ginger Knowles (Halle Berry) with an invitation to work for the mysterious Gabriel (John Travolta), ""What we only fantasise, he does"".Gabriel wants Stanley to hack into a secret government bank account. He will be paid a small fortune; more than enough to get the legal help he needs to gain access to his 10-year old daughter, the only person he really cares about. Gabriel is either a master criminal or an agent of the government in the deepest of cover - we are never really sure. As this unfolds, FBI agent, J.B. Roberts (Don Cheadle) gets on their trail.The theme of misdirection runs through the movie. Gabriel tells Stanley how Houdini could make an elephant disappear in the middle of a theatre full of people through misdirection, ""What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes"". Gabriel, who is also a bit of a film buff, believes the ending of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" was wrong. With more ruthlessness, he believes Al Pacino's character would have got away with it. At the end, he combines a rerun of the bus scene in ""Dog Day"" with the art of misdirection.""Swordfish"" has a look. The use of glass and reflection helps merge digital numbers flashing on computer screens with cityscapes, trendy clubs and luxurious pads, giving the film its sophisticated gloss. Everything is bathed in an amber tint - a little contrived? Sure, but it certainly gives the movie a glow - everything and everyone looks fabulous.Apparently John Travolta received a ""Razzie"" award nomination for his role, but that's rubbish - he steals the movie. He is as effective as some of the best Bond villains. Gabriel is cool, urbane, charismatic and ruthless. Travolta brings the character to life.Jackman is always likable and it doesn't matter that he is involved in a major crime; we know he can't be totally bad. As for Halle Berry? There is a scene in a club where she walks through a crowd of beautiful, willowy girls, and she's still the only one you look at.And then there is her topless scene. Critics thought it looked forced into the film and was totally gratuitous. Well, it's not exactly ""essential to the plot"" so gratuitous maybe. As for it being forced into the film, it actually fits with Ginger's attempts to keep Stanley off guard. Anyway, I bet no one walked out of the theatre because of it.""Swordfish"" is easy to watch, and to judge how good a movie is I always ask myself if I think I could ever watch it again?

But I have to be honest here, I saw Swordfish after America's 9/11 incident, and I am happy it was released way before, because it would NEVER have seen the light of day afterwards. Don't let the action sequences fool you. If this was another time, you could best believe that many in the media would be treating this film like ""Wag the Dog"", but I have realized that these very same folks who had a time comparing the Clinton Administration to ""Wag the Dog"" is staying in a cave because this film so closely resembles the current Bush Administration, its scary. One of the lines that really stuck in my head was when the John Travolta character, Gabriel, says something to a Washington Senator such as ""Patriotism lasts only four years with you people, thank goodness politics may not."" The excess money, the FBI, the characters, the associations, everything will remind you of what is going on and although this film is purely fiction, it is an eye opener and I hope many will see it NOW for what it is giving us hints of what can go on under your nose with people you think are doing good for you and yours when they ae only doing good and profitable for themselves in the name of our bloodshed.

The action scenes are great, Dominic Sena put everything together with fast-paced editing and I was never bored.  The cast is fresh and fun.  Hugh Jackman does a better job at covering up his Aussie accent than he did with ""X Men."" Nobody swaggers into a room like John Travolta, so he's always a joy to watch in this type of character.  Don Cheadle turned in the best performance as a FBI agent.  He made the best out of an otherwise thankless role, showing us once again he's one of our greatest underrated actors. 
However, the plot doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense and neither do the twists.  Even with the whole ""Harry Houdini"" explanation.  Travolta's character is supposed to be a super-terrorist, asking assistance from Hugh Jackman (a noted computer hacker, who's on parole after two years in prison) to hack in and transfer money poured in from a money-laundering scheme to his account.  Travolta's goal is to fund an army of terrorists to blow up cities, kill innocent people, whatever it takes supposedly for the good of the country.  While normal terrorists are out hijacking planes, he hijacks airports.  But apparently he's doing all this for the good of the American people, even if many of those people have to get brutally murdered in the process.  This is the type of film that tides you over and keeps you well-occupied for approximately two hours, but doesn't amount to much.

64,hall895,Not great but not bad either,6,15 December 2011,"Swordfish is a movie with a reputation which precedes it. And that reputation isn't good. People love to take shots at this movie. And to be fair there are some things here which deserve a good mocking. John Travolta's unfortunate haircut. Halle Berry's infamous gratuitous topless scene. Hugh Jackman's silly little computer hacking dance. And there's the big final action sequence which is ridiculous. Actually ridiculous probably isn't strong enough a word for it but that's the best I can come up with at the moment. But despite all this nonsense, and a convoluted plot which the director never manages to sufficiently untangle, the movie is actually reasonably entertaining. There's plenty wrong with it but the movie does enough things right to make it, if not a clear success, at least a decent effort.The movie begins with an opening sequence which is actually rather brilliant. Travolta sits at a table and gives a speech about Hollywood, media and the response to a Dog Day Afternoon type situation. Then he, and a rather confused looking Jackman, walk outside and lo and behold we've got ourselves a Dog Day Afternoon type situation. A bank heist apparently gone quite wrong, hostages, SWAT teams, chaos. Then things explode. Literally. What the heck is going on here? We're as confused as Jackman appears to be. And then we flash back four days. And begin to piece together how exactly we got to this explosive opening we just witnessed.At this point we still have no idea who Travolta and Jackman's characters are. We learn about Jackman's guy first. He's Stanley Jobson, a renowned computer hacker who spent time in prison for infecting an FBI program with a virus. He's got a daughter who his estranged wife won't allow him to see or speak to. All he wants is his daughter back in his life. Ginger, played by Berry, shows up with a proposition. Who's Ginger? Who knows. She's a mystery. She offers Stanley $100,000 just to fly to Los Angeles to meet with her boss. Who's her boss? That's a bigger mystery. The boss turns out to be Travolta of course. Gabriel is the character's name and that's pretty much all we're ever going to know about him. What's he up to, whose side is he on, good guy or bad guy? The movie goes to great pains to keep us guessing. Anyhow Gabriel offers Stanley 10 million dollars to write a worm to steal some government money. 10 million bucks will go a long way towards getting your daughter back so Stanley's in and away we go. The plot twists and turns, often rather confusingly, as it heads back towards that opening scene. Along the way Berry sunbathes topless in a truly pointless scene that earned her an extra $500,000. Nice work if you can get it. When the movie catches up to its opening will all be sufficiently explained? Not really. Is the movie consistently entertaining throughout? Not really. But despite its flaws the movie works just well enough to be worthwhile. It's no great movie by any means. It's not particularly memorable, it's not a movie you'll want to watch again and again. But as cheap, disposable entertainment you could do a lot worse. So many people seem to hate this movie. But it's not bad. Not great, but not that bad at all.",Swordfish
65,jhclues,Good Action from Dominic Sena,8,17 June 2001,"For slam-bang, heart-stopping, adrenaline pumping action, you've come to the right place, and the code name is `Swordfish,' directed by Dominic Sena and starring John Travolta and Hugh Jackman.  In the opening scene, Gabriel Shear (Travolta) is sitting at a table in a coffee shop discussing the hostage situation in the Pacino movie `Dog Day Afternoon,' with a couple of unidentified gentlemen you see only from the back, because the camera is focused on Gabriel.  And it's an absolutely riveting scene.  And it isn't long before the action starts, and once it does it pretty much keeps going until the end, with a brief respite now and then to plug some story into the proceedings.  The plot is fairly complex and somewhat convoluted, but the main thing is you get an idea of who the good guys and the bad guys are, or at least enough to keep you in the story, which is held together by some incredible action that is ruthless and relentless.  	Gabriel is something of an enigmatic presence from the beginning; you know he's up to something and that it involves the transferring of a huge amount of money  (like in the billions) that belongs to someone else from their bank accounts into his own.  But to successfully effect his plan he needs the services of the number one computer hacker in the world.  Enter Stanley Jobson, newly paroled after a stretch in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary; he's the man for the job, but the terms of his parole forbid him to even touch a computer.  Gabriel, however, has done his homework, and knows how to get to Jobson, and it has to do with Stanley's estranged daughter, and his need for some cold, hard cash that would enable him to go into court and fight his ex-wife for custody.  And when the amount Gabriel offers Jobson is so far beyond anything he could imagine, it makes it hard to turn him down. But then again, if he winds up back in the slammer, he's never going to see his daughter again.  So what's it to be?  Gabriel has no doubts about which way Jobson will go, though; he's very persuasive, and he's a man who is used to getting anything he wants.	Sena is no John Woo, but he definitely knows how to keep things interesting and moving along so quickly that any plot holes that may surface are lost in the swirl of the action.  And he comes right at you with it, big and loud and thoroughly entertaining, just what you want in an action film-- and unlike Sena's previous outing, `Gone In 60 Seconds,' there is enough story here to keep it involving.  There's a good use of foreshadowing, too, from the opening scene, in which Gabriel pretty much outlines what you can expect, to another prominent element which, if it gets by you will have you slapping your forehead and saying, `Right!  I get it!'   
	Travolta does a good job of bring Gabriel to life and conveying that subtle menace that makes him a threatening presence without appearing outwardly brutal or malicious.  But there's a complexity to the character that he never really lets you in on, and you can only guess as to what it is that really motivates him.  Jackman, on the other hand, gives you a pretty good indication of what makes Jobson tick, though what you see is pretty much what you get; as with Travolta's character, there isn't much time for character development, but you're at least given enough to get a handle on them.  The same goes for Halle Berry's Ginger, whom you're never quite sure of until the very end.  Berry certainly cuts a striking figure, however, and she has a smoldering screen presence that makes her a good fit with both Travolta and Jackman.  Don Cheadle gives a good performance as Agent Roberts, though it isn't much of a stretch for him artistically; in Roberts, in fact, there is a definite resemblance to the character he played in `Traffic.'	The supporting cast includes Vinnie Jones (Marco), Camryn Grimes (Holly), Sam Shepard (The Senator), Laura Wachal (Helga) and Zach Grenier (A,D. Joy). Sena definitely moves up a rung on the action/director's ladder with `Swordfish,' which is well made and packed with thrills, action and some engaging performances.  it may not be a film that will go down in cinematic history, but it's good entertainment and a cut above the usual summer fare that falls within the action genre.  Travolta casts a mean evil eye, Jackman's fingers fly over a keyboard and Berry sizzles.  Not much more you could ask for, I think, in an action movie.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",Swordfish
66,CharltonBoy,An above average action movie,8,10 March 2002,Swordfish is a razor sharp action movie does not fail to deliver in the action stakes and entertains throught. John Travolta stars as a high tech criminal who plots to rob the goverment of 9.5 million dollars by hacking into their computers and stealing their money. He has to recrute the worlds best hacker(Hugh Jackman)to do the job even though he is reluctant to have anything to do with it. Don Cheadle is impressive as the guy who has to stop them. The film is stuffed full of brilliant special affect but without doubt the best sight is the film is Halle Berry with her kit off! It must be the only reason she is in the film because her character served no real purpose. This is one of Travolta's better film's although this is no Pulp Fiction but then again it is no White Mans Burden either. 8 out of 10.,Swordfish
67,wkozak221,"Bizarre, disappointing film.",4,20 November 2018,I watched this on a whim. I was disappointed beyond belief. Travolta had a strange 'beard' ? The idea of Jackman's character hiding info on a university computer and no one finding it is laughable. Could have done without the dancing. Him escaping down a hillside covered with plastic is unbelievable. How is he going to stop? I know how he does but it is not based in reality. I am pretty sure the law enforcement agencies would have figured a way to go in and diffuse the problem. The only saving grace? Travolta smokes a very nice cigar.,Swordfish

No, for much of the film, ""Swordfish"" rocks, with plenty of action and two notable performances, Halle Berry and John Travolta.

69,jon.h.ochiai,An entertaining ride...,7,11 June 2001,"John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, and Halle Berry in ""Swordfish"" is a fun ride, not a great movie, though an enjoyable one. Dominic Sena's movie is frenetic at best, and incoherent at the opposite end of the spectrum. It's amazing what star power can overcome. The movie has everything: hacker tech stuff, quality topless scene from Halle Berry, gunfights, and aerial bus chases. John Travolta as the rogue agent Gabriel Shear (great name) is particularly good in the opening scene, and is effective throughout. Halle Berry as the femme fa tale Ginger is hot in basically a cardboard role. Hugh Jackman as ex-con hacker and Wired Magazine's 1997 Man of the Year, Stanley Jobson, is really displaying his star power. It's up to Stanlely to steal $9.5 billion for Gabriel from Shear's shadow organization of the FBI-- investment banking for the Bureau, and rescue his daughter Holly. Jackman always brings intelligence to his roles, and in this case he brings an athleticism and physicality to the role of a computer hacker which is different and works. Jackman balances the don't f--- with me attitude, and the caring father role with style. Jackman makes ""Swordfish"" worthwhile.",Swordfish
70,stamper,Excellent and original,8,22 October 2001,"There has been quite some controversy surrounding this films release in Europe. It was due to be released in some countries shortly after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11th 2001. Despite that controversy and shock caused by the events on September 11th the film got released here in The Netherlands the week afterwards, whereas in for instance Great Britain they chose not to release the film into cinemas. Whatever reasons there were for not releasing the film in GB I think it was not a good' decision. Although it is true that the film is about terrorism, I think not that it was a reason to not release it. I mean, people who do not want to see this film, can choose for themselves I think and their choices need not to be made by others. I would have understood, if the attacks had been in GB or the film would have been out for release in the US, but this, NO. I mean it is not so much that I do not feel for the people that suffered and died due to those attacks (I do and I was as shocked as anyone), but I will not let terrorists or politicians take away my choices in entertainment. Furthermore, I do not think there will be no more action movies in the next years or people will stop going to the cinema's for these kind of movies, simply because people forget. You'll see, wait another 5 to 15 years and they will make a film of the September 11th attacks.
This film, controversial as it might have been on it's release in Europe, is a quality product. You might expect that too, when you see all those names of actors John Travolta (Face/Off, Broken Arrow, Pulp Fiction, Phenomenon and so on), Halle Berry (The Flintstones, X  Men), Hugh Jackman (X  Men) and Vinnie Jones (Lock Stock and two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Gone in 60 Seconds). But not only these people promise quality. The director, Dominic Sena, a fresh graduate of the Jerry Bruckheimer school of directing (Gone in 60 Seconds) and producer Joel Silver (The Matrix, Die hard 1 + 2, Leathal Weapon 1  4, Conspiracy Theory and so on) also stand for quality entertainment and action and I must say that these are the two things this film delivers. The story starts with the and most originally filmed and executed explosion I've ever seen in the beginning of a movie and then flashbacks to set you up with an explosive story that will lead you to an even bigger ending. The directing and action sequences are perfect as are the characters and the acting. In that last department there are three people that I think genuinely stand out. John Travolta (of course), Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry.
John Travolta delivers the perfect bad guy, who has somehow understandable motives and is even colder than ice. He does not only seem to be enjoying his evil' part even more than in Broken Arrow and Face/Off, but he also seems to have learned from his earlier bad guy' work in creating the coolest and most believable villain I've seen in new film lately. Not to say that the villains he played in Broken Arrow were not believable, but they only had either personal enrichment (Broken Arrow) or destruction (Face/Off) on their minds. This character, however has an ideal he wants to realize. It must be accomplished by breaking the law, which in my mind makes him not only a better villain but a more dangerous one too.
As in regard to Hugh Jackman, his role is to play the good bad guy'. He has an understandable motive to virtually every move he makes in his film and is totally believable in that. He actually is one of the few in this film to show any emotion of any kind which does not only make him (due to a good performance) sympathetic to the viewer, but also underscores his motives in going along with this terrorist act. 
Halle Berry's performance, in this film, differs so much from the other characters in her films in regard to her playing people with both her body and her words. She is excellently cast as Travolta sexy sidekick.
I've complimented so many people in this review, I get the feeling I missed someone and I know exactly whom. You may as well compliment people on directing and acting, but where o where would they be without a decent script? NOWHERE!!! Well this script was delivered to us by someone whom I've already witnessed once in the movie business: Skip Woods. And I must say his first effort (Thursday), which he both wrote and directed really stuck in my head. The film, was nothing short of this one, as far as quality goes. In my mind it was one of the best Pulp Fiction-esque films I've ever seen. I can assure you that it is as exciting, original and surprising as this one. It might be a bit more provocative than this one but if you liked this one you'll sure as hell like Thursday. Don't believe me? Well try me and rent it!

72,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Recycled refuse,4,16 April 2008,"""Swordfish"" is a reasonably exciting action movie upon the first viewing. However, anyone who has seen a good thriller before we'll quickly see that ""Swordfish"" is not much more than recycled refuse painted over with a nice gloss in the form of a big budget production.Though ironically that big budget production wasn't used to its full extent and, in a completely bizarre move, the film's most spectacular set piece is shown to the audience within the first 5 minutes of the movie. It is a truly spectacular explosion and demonstrates top notch special effects, but there is nothing left to match it in later parts of the film. Thus, despite having a good amount of action the film never amounts to a good climatic action scene.Another thing is the that main villain (or is he?) Gabriel Shear is one of the most spectacularly absurd screen characters in a long while. He is a bizarre mix of ritzy billionaire, collage playboy, and highly adept spy. It seems like the movie makers weren't sure of what to make him so they just made him everything. That way there can be car chase, but with a really nice expensive car. There is also a nice expensive mansion with plenty of bare babes and even more expensive cars. Basically the perfect place for a spy to live and keep a low profile about his secretive work.In the end, ""Swordfish"" is not nearly the intelligent thriller it wants to be. Vinnie Jones even appears as a tough henchmen who threatens a hostage by putting a gun up his a... well you know. Incidentally that is his only purpose here before being blown up. With random excess like that there is not way that this can be a good tightly plotted thriller. The overly edited action scenes (except the very first one) don't help either. The only possible interest here that anyone could have is that the film drew some (most likely unintentional) parallels with post 9/11 realities as there are hints of government funded terrorism. But that still doesn't elevate this to any higher level. --- 4/10 Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+",Swordfish

In ""Swordfish"" (2001), John Travolta stars as a man with a terrible hairpiece who is weirdly self-conscious about the fact that he is in a movie and basically goes about being a total arrogant jerk. Hugh Jackman stars as the poor foil for all of Travolta's hijinks, some of which are laughably sexual. Check the Parents Guide for those details. Halle Berry and John Travolta spend most of the time patronising Hugh Jackman. There's a lot of raised eyebrows, knowing glances. Its all very schoolyard and not very sophisticated. Halle Berry is weird in this. She's got her boobs out, which is nice. Worth the infamous paycheck? Dunno. She gives this weird kind of serpentine performance that is just upsetting, almost to the level of Elizabeth ""Showgirls"" Berkley.Still, the movie is slick and fun, even in 2015. It's mainly saved by Hugh Jackman, who is, as always, eminently likable. The overall tone of ""Swordfish"" I put somewhere between smarmy and patronising. Its got that cocky assurance that comes from being a self-aware techno-thriller that came out just before the bubble of The Matrix was burst by all those revolutions. Yes it was a hit, but it was so cynically designed to be a hit that time has forgotten about it, now that computer hacking is more a nuisance than a source of novelty and excitement.Enjoyable as a time capsule, and an example of a hit movie made without superheroes.

What I say doesn't make sense now, but if you see the movie you will understand my complaints.John Travolta stars as Gabriel Shear, an enigmatic and treacherous spy who hires Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackson), one of the best computer hackers alive, to break some airtight security systems to steal a large sum of illegal government funding. Gabriel and his beautiful young partner, (girlfriend, or whatever she is) Ginger (Halle Berry), persuade Stanley to help them with their task, but not with money or power, but with the means to reunite with his daughter. He lost custody of her after spending time in jail for hacking into the FBI's controversial cyber surveillance systems. His ex-wife, a lazy alcoholic, is now married to the an influential pornographer. Gee, I dunno-if I was a judge for a child custody case, I might rule for the girl to live with a computer hacker rather than a full scale porn king and his slacker wife with drinking problems.The plot runs deeper than that, but I do not want to give too much away. There are subplots about government corruption, double crossing, and there is a unique bank heist and several exciting car chases. Then there is the person reuniting with his daughter, an obsessed patriot who does not know where to draw the line, and something about computer hacking? ""Swordfish,"" details all that and more, but with a plate so full, and with so many complex issues at hand, the film needs more than just a highly stylized visual arena.The film's, Dominic Sena, brought us the highly visual action thriller ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" last year. I liked that film because the action worked with the good against evil story. There is a lot of potential with this script by Skip Woods, but ""Swordfish"" is very different from ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" Sena gets away with a lack of character development and plot depth in ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" because it solely exists as an action picture. ""Swordfish"" wants to be more, therefore, Sena cannot get away with sheer style, action, and energy. The themes and motives deserve more. According to the movie's web site, Dominic Sena wanted to give Gabriel's world a high sheen of glamour with lots of color. ""We were constantly mixing gels and the color palette is pretty strong,"" Sena explains. ""Each location had a color palette assigned to it and the practical lighting dictated the light we would use on the actors. For instance, if there was a green lantern, the light on the faces would be green instead of trying to create perfect flesh tones. It looks glossy and sexy, which is the right look for this picture.""The behind the scenes production team is led by director of photography Pail Cameron, production designer Jeff Mann, and special effects coordinator Mike Meinardis, who all worked on ""Gone in Sixty Seconds."" The technical aspects here are first rate, the fault lies within the screenplay and, I suppose even Dominic Sena can share some of the blame. Sena starts the movie with a mature attitude and reasonable motives, but he eventually switches the story to auto pilot when car chases, bank robberies, and shoot-outs inhabit the plot instead of wit, edge, and complex, thought-provoking material.Does ""Swordfish"" really need its last half to be action-ridded, and laced with double and triple crosses, changes in character motivations, and the stylized violence? Yes, it's well acted and visually enticing, but the movie sets up plot twists for the sole reason to contain plot twists. The film does manage to pull the rug from under us a few startling times, but these turning points do not serve much of a purpose and do not truly reveal anything about the story.I screened ""Swordfish"" with a friend, who loved this movie, and he could, for the most part, justify most of his opinions, and challenged my own; he provided logical points of explanation behind his recommendation. But I think he is simply filling in the blanks the movie leaves open. I like a movie that makes you think, and one that leaves a lot to your imagination, but ""Swordfish"" is entirely based on what we interpret. To draw a solid conclusion from a movie, it needs to give us more than hints and implications. The film makes it very clear we cannot trust it, so why does it leave so much up for us to draw from it. Maybe you will make more out of this production than me. It's an easy movie to enjoy; there are some astonishing special effects. In one car chase scene involving the police and a bus, Gabriel changes his travel plans, and a massive helicopter flies down, attaching itself to the bus, and lifts it away. Wow-we've never seen that before!",Swordfish
79,anselmdaniel,Confusing and muddled,4,27 January 2019,"This review contains spoilers.Swordfish is an action movie that premiered in 2001. The movie is directed by Dominic Sena and is written by Skip Woods. The movie stars John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, and Don Cheadle. The movie is about criminals that use hacking in order to conduct a bank robbery. The movie mainly focuses on computer hacker Stanley Jobson played by Hugh Jackman.Swordfish is a messy movie. This is a movie with incredibly poor structure and pacing. Every character in this movie is given basic motivations, but even this is not done well. The story of this movie tries too much and accomplishes too little. Even at a 99 minute running time, this movie
fails at delivering a polished and focused experience.The actors in this movie are not great in their performance. I believe the actors were not given much to work with as the writing is not good. All of the actors deliver a flat performance. Normally these actors can be great, but the direction of the movie does not allow for this. I believe the only benefit in watching this movie is to watch the actors be placed in ridiculous situations that the script calls for. One of these being Stanley Jobson being pressured into hacking to finish the job. That was a hilarious scene, but it comes to indicate what to expect from the movie. There are simply ridiculous situations that come to characterize the movie.The direction of this movie by Dominic Sena is fine albeit flat. There are no unique scenes that this movie does well. The action in this movie is fun but there are no stand out scenes. This made the movie only a stick in the mud save for the crazy scenes involving the actors.The movie's writing is incredibly poor. This movie is fitted with riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies. The audience is simply forced to go along with the movie as the audience is bombarded with scenes that do not make sense. This movie could absolutely be improved on this aspect, but it was not. Many of the scenes in this movie are gratuitous.I do not recommend 'Swordfish'. This movie had barely any redeeming qualities and is a terrible movie. There are many other better movies in 2001 and make for a better experience than Swordfish. Action junkies can watch any other movie to be fulfilled.Grade: F",Swordfish
80,gigan-92,Not All That Great,5,20 March 2012,"This movie stars the likes of Hugh Jackman, Don Cheadle, and yes, John Travolota. I'm not even going to talk much about Halle Berry, who's only point in the film is eye candy basically. Then again, if I had boobies and was offered a bonus of 100,000 (which is in addition to the already paid $2 million) just to show them off well sh*t, wouldn't hurt right? This film's tone changes rapidly in a really bad meshing together of things. The beginning exposition pays tribute to a 'similar' (feels bad just typing it) film, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and the scenario seems somewhat comparable at first. That is until one of the hostages makes a run for it and explodes which leads to a 360 degree view of the very large boom. Right then and there it breaks any ties it had to the subtle ""Dog Day Afternoon"".The film parades around with this overdose of nice suits, nice cars and luscious women, over dampening its attempted political angle with Hollywood tripe. Was it really necessary to have Jackman hack a computer with a gun to his head AND getting a blow job? I mean how many people really bought that? And I don't mean to poke fun at the movie, but the amount of overly loud action scenes, with their exceptional explosions did initially lead me to believe it was a Michael Bay film. It isn't though but was it trying to be? ""To be or not to be, that is the question.""",Swordfish
81,FlickJunkie-2,Great action flick with drawbacks,7,11 November 2001,"This is one of those films that do some things really well and others terribly.  The story is a slick action techno-thriller, although it is not particularly original.  It is essentially `Dog Day Afternoon' meets `The Matrix'.  A mysterious cyber terrorist known as Gabriel (John Travolta) is recruiting renowned hackers to pilfer $9.5 billion from a secret fund of a long defunct FBI black ops group.  Stanley (Hugh Jackman) is a brilliant hacker, recently busted and forbidden to touch a computer as part of his parole.   He is lured into the plan because he is promised that he will be able to be reunited with his daughter, whom he is prevented from seeing by court order.  The sticky part is that to access the network, they must commandeer a computer in the World Banc which requires taking over the bank and holding hostages while Stanley does his magic.  The plot has a number of surprises as it twists along, keeping the viewer thinking and engaged, although it requires a healthy suspension of disbelief in many parts.Joel Silver (of `Lethal Weapon', `Die Hard' and `Matrix' fame) produced this film, so it was a given that it would push the envelope on action and pyrotechnics.  He hired Dominic Sena to direct, still juiced from his success in `Gone in Sixty Seconds'.  Clearly Sena brings great enthusiasm for the action genre, which was responsible for putting him on the map. From that standpoint, the film is a complete success.  The action sequences are intense and the visual effects are outstanding, including explosions in panoramic slow motion and a flying bus.  Sena also does a good job developing the characters, peeling away Gabriel's motivation slowly and keeping the viewer guessing as to whether he is good or evil.  I was also impressed with Sena's visual interpretations, giving us interesting angles, rich blends of color and extremely innovative lighting.On the unfortunate side, we have the shameless sexploitation of Halle Berry and other female characters for the sole purpose of pumping up the box office with the 18-45 male demographic.  We are insulted with such unrealistic scenes as Stanley trying to break into the DOD computers in 60 seconds while being fellated and having a gun to his head.  Berry is forced to do a completely gratuitous frontal topless scene (twice), and numerous scenes in various states of undress to land a role where most of her best lines involved references to the male organ.  I have no problem with explicit sex if it bears some relationship to the story, but this was unabashed objectification of women, having no reason for being there other than titillation.Another thing I found particularly ironic was Travolta's opening dialogue discussing the lack of realism in Hollywood films within a film that in many ways typifies the very aspects of filmmaking he is reviling.  I'm not sure whether Sena and Silver were poking a little fun at themselves here or just didn't realize that this film really didn't differentiate itself from the criticism.From an acting perspective, John Travolta finally re-enters his own body after two consecutive abominations (`Battlefield Earth', `Lucky Numbers') where he seemed to be inhabited by some nefarious being with no acting ability.  Travolta returns to his brilliant bad guy form reminiscent of `Face Off' and `Broken Arrow', only here he is even bolder, more arrogant and utterly remorseless.  Hugh Jackman turns in his best performance to date as the cyber jock.  Jackman exudes maleness without sacrificing the softer side as seen in the touching scenes with his onscreen daughter Holly (eleven year old Camryn Grimes).  Jackman also gives a virtuoso performance trying to crack the government system in a scene where he is the equivalent of Jerry Lee Lewis on a computer keyboard.Don Cheadle turns in another solid performance as the FBI assistant director.  Cheadle always impresses me with his dramatic skills.  Hopefully he will land some meatier roles.  Finally, there's Halle Berry.  Berry is a skilled and beautiful actress who has a lot more talent to offer than was tapped by this film.  Here she only had to be sexy and talk trash, the first being automatic and the second requiring no special skill.  It is a pity that she is relegated to parts such as this and her role in `X-Men' to get work after turning in such a brilliant dramatic performance in `Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'.This film features some promising direction by Sena, excellent performances by Travolta and Jackman and some top flight action sequences, but suffers from a derivative and overly fantastic story and a profusion of sexual non sequiturs.  However, even with its drawbacks I rated it a 7/10.  Action junkies will definitely get their money's worth.",Swordfish
82,redkiwi,Does the irony bite John?,8,29 July 2001,"This starts with a monologue from Travolta as to how s**t all the Hollywood cinematic product is.  Phenomenon.  Battlefield Earth.  Everything since Pulp Fiction [other than Mad City].  Does the irony bite John?On a fair note, this is a really enjoyable film.  Shadowy government agent Travolta recruits Jackman to hack into a 9.5 billion dollar slush fund, to transfer the monies.The interplay between the two was excellent, the technology side of it wasn't utter BS for a change and Halle Berry was absolutely lovely as usual.Good fun, well scripted, acted and directed.

83,famousgir1,Stop Everything You're Doing And Just Go See This Movie NOW!,10,27 July 2001,"Swordfish is definitely  one of the best movies of the year. From start to finish, it has everything you could want in a movie. Their are some great scenes here and the action sequences are brilliant and all the little twists in the movie are really great too.I couldn't of ask for better cast in a film too. The *amazing* Huge Jackman is obviously brilliant as always as Stanley Jobson. (And he's looking stunning as usual.) John Travolta is back on track as the bad guy Gabriel Shear and Halle Berry is really good as the mysterious  Ginger Knowles. Don Cheadle is also quite good as Agent A.D. Roberts. Did they have to add Vinnie Jones to the movie though? I think not.The ending in the film is really good and really intense too. I REALLY hope that they make a sequel to Swordfish. I'm sure it would be just as brilliant. Anyway, Swordfish is fantastic and a must-see for everyone, especially if you like action and crime movies. I give Swordfish a well deserving 10/10. Now, go see it NOW!",Swordfish
84,LebowskiT1000,"Great Action, Great Fun!",9,2 August 2002,"There is something about this movie that I just love.  I love the story, I love the action sequences, I love the actors, I love the way the film was shot, I love everything about this film.I must admit though, when I saw the trailer and that bus was flying through the air connected to that helicopter, I was thinking ""What on earth is that?!?!""  But after seeing that movie, I absolutely loved that idea and that whole scene!  Also, I want to mention that I love that the wheels on the bus are made of wood (or something to that effect) as to avoid getting it's tires shot out by the cops.  Very smart!The beginning of the film has one scene that I particularly like, and I'm sure if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm referring to.  The way the film was shot, was incredible, I loved everything in it.  The only part that I was a little less than stoked about was the very first opening scene, where John Travolta is talking and the camera is moving around him, going in and out of focus.  I thought that little scene was filmed a bit odd, but after that scene the filming is excellent.  Dominic Sena is becoming a great director!  So far he has only directed ""Kalifornia"", ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"" and this film, I'm VERY curious to see his next work.As I mentioned, the actors are great in this film!  I think Hugh Jackman doesn't get the credit he deserves.  I thought he did an EXCELLENT job in this film, as well as his other film credits.  John Travolta pulls off one of his better performances in a while.  Halle Berry and Don Cheadle are great as always.  Sam Shepard and Tate Donovan do a good job with their roles, despite having very little screen time.  Vinnie Jones plays a VERY similar character as he did in ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"", but nonetheless a good performance.  The young actress, Camryn Grimes, deserves some credit too.  She did a very good job with her role, it seems that good young actors are hard to come by.If you are a fan of action movies, than I would hope that you would like this film.  I thought it was excellent from start to finish and a very well told story.  I hope that you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading,-Chris",Swordfish
85,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: solid, but nothing special",5,30 March 2002,"I'm an action movie junkie, so you would think that Swordfish would be just right for me. In fact, a lot of cool stuff does blow up. Unfortunately, as in ""Broken Arrow"", John Travolta once again plays a psycho mastermind in a movie that's not very inspired.I think what happened is that Swordfish tries hard to be the hardest-punching loudest-banging biggest-blowing-up movie around. It's trying so hard that it comes across as silly, reminding me of ""Mission of Mars"" where the audience often laughed at the key moments of tension.For example, John Travolta's character is so, so cool that it's hard to forget that they are, after all, just highly paid actors sitting on a set. (That's why it's so easy to act cool). Characters make stupid decisions, do a lot of posing, the protagonist is not easy to identify with, and the ending wasn't satisfying to me.However, a lot of cool stuff sure does blow up, so it's not all a waste.Who should see this film:-- action movie buffs who have nothing better to do on a rainy day, and don't require much of anything in a film beyond stuff blowing up. Go rent ""Broken Arrow"", too.-- I can't think of anyone elseI'll give Swordfish a 5 out of 10.",Swordfish
86,saadanathan,Good writing and story 7/10,7,21 May 2020,"I was pretty impressed by the result of ""Swordfish"". It had a good opening, an opening sequence of 6 - 7 minutes that was really good, good characters and well made story. The writing of the plot is very interesting and offers a lot in the exposition, a fantastic cast of actors: John Travolta,
Hugh jackman, Halle berry, Don Cheadle. although this type of movie where there are hostages, gangsters and a whole operation going down has already been seen before in movies. Even the twist at the end is a kind of ending we see in other movies like this one so there isn't something new going on. Maybe the plot of the movie hasn't been seen before so the story feels original but the idea itself reminds me of movies like: ""Den of Thieves"" or ""Heist"".",Swordfish
87,Java_Joe,Cool and stylish but far from perfect.,6,29 October 2019,"Swordfish has, in my opinion, one of the greatest opening scenes of any movie I've seen. And then from there it just kinda meanders along. Not to say it's bad or anything, but it just feels a little lacking.It starts with John Travolta giving a lovely little speech on the state of movies today and how Hollywood pumps out a product that is a word that IMDB won't let me use but you can figure out. This is followed up by a great action scene even if it is marred by some rather lackluster attempt at pulling off ""bullet time"". The Matrix had come out a little while before and suddenly everybody was using it so that can be forgiven. From there the movie takes a couple steps back and shows us the events that led up to this.John Travolta plays a... government agent of sorts but one working entirely in the shadows. Him and his team are the ones called on to do the stuff that the government simply can't acknowledge any part of. But in order to continue they need money. Money that is hidden in a series of bank accounts that very few people actually know of. In order to get their hands on this, they require the services of a cracker that can break the security around any system and this is where Hugh Jackman shows up. What follows is a high speed, action packed movie where nothing is necessarily as it seems.It's an enjoyable movie for you to just sit back, munch on some popcorn and see some cool scenes. Just don't expect anything award winning.",Swordfish

Despite the cast being pretty good in their roles, Travolta is capable of better than this, and I do not see the need for Ms. Berry being topless, but I guess that is what sells nowadays.

90,chrisbrown6453,"Computer hacker, 360 degree stop action sequence, crashing helicopter sequence; is this The Matrix sequel?",7,21 June 2002,"Swordfish, Warner Brothers 'latest foray in the teched-out action film genre, is directed by Dominic Sena.  The Matrix parallels are apparent. Computer hacker (Hugh Jackman) meets beautiful, stunningly self-sufficient girl (Halle Berry) who shows up to tell him that he must rendezvous with her mysterious boss (John Travolta), described by one character as a man who ""lives in a world outside of our world."" *Ah hem,* Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, 'nuff said. Add a familiar 360 degree camera trick and a Helicopter sequence to boot and the mimicry becomes caustic, corrosive, and hey, just bad form.
But Swordfish only steals from The Matrix on a marginal level; the film's storyline diverges into it's own cyber-espionage drama, filled with double-crossing and mistaken identities. Unfortunately, this course lacks the sort of philosophical underpinnings that gave The Matrix its weight as an action film. Swordfish, instead centers thematically on patriotism and misdirection, leading to an ending that plays out like the grand finale of The Usual Suspects, minus the punch and complexity of ""Suspects' closing revelation. All this makes one wonder, 'Why has writing an original script become such an impossibility?'But for what it's worth, the film still presents an ample dosage of eye-candy. Halle Berry bares her breasts (in what is perhaps one of the least motivated bare breasted scenes in cinematic history) and is otherwise consistently scantily clad. Perhaps even better (and what could possibly be?) is the fever created by the first ten minutes of the film. Jon Travolta opens with an awesome speech about contemporary cinema that is impossibly cool (but that also unwisely inflates expectations), leading to a bank heist that goes wrong. The end of this opening scene features an eight hundred thousand dollar still-array sequence. Whereas those depicted in the Matrix were around characters frozen temporarily in action, this one is around an explosion that destroys a city block. Despite the technique's familiar resonances, the sequence is breathtaking, and a true advancement in the technical arts. Given dialogue that is often riddled with clichéd lines, the actors fare well. Without the Wolverine blades and Mutton chops, Jackman has the opportunity to play a role colored by his own aesthetic, and he is genuinely appealing, with the exception of an irrelevant 'hacking' scene, featuring Jackman virtually dancing around a computer console (to his own, later embarrassment, no doubt). Travolta's role is largely weakened by the faults of the script, but the actor does what he can, tinting his villainous character with his patented, ironically soothing vocal intonations.
Halle Berry is gorgeous and undaunted by her often tiresome lines, pulling them off with a refreshing confidence. Don Cheadle, who appears in the film as a cyber-crimes agent, is drastically underutilized. His pervasive wit is held back by the confining parameters of the script, but the character he portrays, though underdeveloped, still smacks of a certain hard-driven personality.While visually, Swordfish advances still-array effects' boundaries in its first ten minutes, the remainder of the movie falls under the narrative cast set by pioneering films of the recent past. But with featured actors working against a script comprised of both loudly and inconspicuously rehashed ideas, the film does gain merit. Not enough, unfortunately, to make it a story that is as original or compelling as those from which it appropriated its ideas. The Moral: It ain't always wise to reload prematurely.",Swordfish
91,bsinc,What the hell happened here,6,9 August 2002,"It is an extremely rare occasion that I come across a movie I don't get at all. I mean at all. What exactly is the plot I still don't know. It's a very confusing movie, with some nice and memorable action scenes, the best one being when Stanley has to ""pass his initiation test"", but there ares some extremely bad special effects as well, so this is no ""Matrix"". It tries to be though, shamelessly, there's the same music, a very similar interrogation room, the whole world existing above ours ordeal and of course when the bomb explodes you get to see every possible human casualty cause the camera pulls a 360 on your ass:). Speaking of this opening scene, what's the deal here, it's just a nice opening, but the actual scene takes place somewhere in the middle, so why is it in the beginning. It doesn't even have some sort of meaning or attachment to the rest of the story, nothing, it's just a cheap movie trick;action in the beginning so the audience doesn't get bored straight away. The best part of this movie is Halle Berry, naturally. She's the reason why I give this movie a fairly high grade.

The plot is wild, but that's not really a problem, you soon just fly along with it. The action sequences are stylish, new and fabulous to watch, and the ending, well it's a superb choice.

It's getting so ridiculous & commonplace now, that films can legally claim to have 'a twist' if the Senator turns out to be clean & above board.This film was just far too difficult to take seriously. The security at the airport leave a suspect alone in a room while they go off & check his legality? Two hitmen are able to not only walk into a police station but to the room next door, assasinate the suspect & then walk out without a single problem? Who incidentally had a Finnish lawyer speaking in German.Then you had a terribly miscast & misnamed Jackman as Stanley the computer geek who amongst other things risked his daughters life in circumstances too difficult to believe, looked shellshocked when confronted with nothing but screensavers & should have been shot on several occasions by incompetent police, yet able to survive a 100 metre fall.I like Don Cheadle & he's a good actor but is given nothing to work with here. Surely he would've made more of an effort to get his boss to listen when confronted with mass deaths. You would have also expected the screaming girl to have told those hauling away what was instore, ie being blown up.Halle Berry's tits were a welcome relief, but even I'd admit they were completely unnecessary for the scene. They might just have worked in the scene where she had her wire on but not the one where it happened. All the sex scenes were largely unnecessary.All in all, there were too many cliches in Swordfish, too much you couldn't take seriously and a pedestrian pace to the storyline. After the opening scenes & the drop back by 4 days, the almost entire film was devoted to the build up to a robbery which was never enough to hold the viewers attention for more than a minute or so. The problem is in the subject of computer hacking. Occasionally it can pass as interesting to read about but it just doesn't work on film. There is too much reliance on images & terms alien to most, leaving them to basically take the director & actors word for what is occurring. But even I clocked that if Stanley was so talented a hacker surely he would've altered his records to allow him to see his daughter that way.3/10",Swordfish
99,basrutten,Tries very hard and falls completely flat,3,30 September 2004,"""Swordfish"" is one of those movies that are made by people that think that they can get away with everything as long as they put enough action and eye candy in a movie. Given the fact that this catastrophe of a movie still gets an average rating of 6.2, they're right to a certain extent. Unfortunately, that doesn't make the movie any better. ""Swordfish"" tries really hard to be a cool and complex cyber-thriller. Unfortunately, it fails in almost every way. First of all, the story is a convoluted mess. There are plenty of twists and turns, but none of them are really believable and the plot is incoherent rather than really complex. The movie takes itself fairly seriously (too seriously, I'd say), but the action is so over the top and all the talk about hacking and computers is so silly that the movie becomes unintentionally funny and mostly just doesn't work. The fact that the makers of this movie thought that they needed a topless Halle Berry or an overacting John Travolta to make things interesting, doesn't really help either. ""Swordfish"" tries very hard to be cool and complex, but is so hampered by a garbled mess that passes for a plot and a lot of (over-the-top) silliness that it falls completely flat on its face. * out of *****",Swordfish
100,Shiva-11,"Berry bares breasts and bags bank busting bonus! Oh yeah, and a bunch of things blow up.",7,8 June 2001,"Swordfish:The Cold War spawned decades of tension, mistrust, disastrous proxy wears, and kept the world under the constant threat of nuclear war.  With the collapse of the Berlin Wall freedom became more than a concept for 100's of millions of people, capitalism rolled through virgin territory like a swarm, and it seemed that peace was on the horizon.  For most people this was a good thing, but for the vast legions of superspooks, used to plying their trade under the cover of darkness, it threatened their job security.  Lucky for them there was a corresponding rise in civil wars, radical fundamentalism, and corporate espionage.  Stanley is not just a hacker, he is The Man.  Busted for trying to derail Big Brother's desire to snoop in on everyone's lives, he not only spent 18 months in Leavenworth, but he's been banned from touching another computer for as long as he lives.  Settling into a dead-end job in the oilfields, he can't get his daughter out of his mind, and would do anything to get her away from her drug addled porn star mother and porn producing stepfather. Opportunity shows up in the form of Ginger, the attaché for a mysterious spook named Gabriel who may be ex-CIA, Mossad, or NSA.  Maybe.   All Stanley has to do is hack into the mother of all computer system, electronically hijack a few billion in change, and he walks away with ten million to pay for the best family lawyers money can buy, no strings attached.  Yeah, and I'm the tooth fairy.Swordfish begins with an interesting monologue in which Gabriel (Travolta) discusses Hollywood's treatment - or more precisely relentless butchery- of cinema, and the all too familiar conventions where the good guy wins and bad guy dies (and he should know).  The discussion is especially interesting when the perspective and context are revealed (and no I won't do that here). What follows is an amazing action sequence and then the film grinds to a halt and goes in reverse for several days to set up the situation.  There is little action for the next 45 minutes, an interesting scene where Stanley (Jackman) has to hack into a computer system while being ""distracted"", the much ballyhooed scene with Halle Barry baring her breasts (one of the most gratuitous nude scenes ever) and a bit of intrigue.  Bring on Johnny.Despite the fact that he has been in some of the most embarrassing movies ever produced, everyone seems to like John Travolta, (I particularly enjoy him when he is a villain - with the exception of ""Battlefield Drek""), and once again he does not disappoint.  Gabriel is downright nasty, a cold-blooded patriot spook who has no qualms about making examples of terrorists - they bomb a bus, he'll nuke one of their cities practicality in the extreme.  Hugh Jackman's character is actually a lot like Wolverine, in that he's an outcast who's trying to do something for the sake of justice and willing to accept the consequences.  As Stanley, he has the right mix of manic and steadfastness to be believable.  Halle Berry, despite her nude scene (I much preferred her in her lingerie, not only did she look good but the scene had a purpose) is electric as Ginger the sidekick who may not be what she seems.  Back to the movie.The thing that annoyed me was that the film starts with a bang then made me wait hour to give me another adrenaline fix.  Unless I've got a riveting plot, I need steady action, delivered in big doses and Swordfish delivers neither (it reminded me of ""Mission Impossible II"" in that respect).  Also, here is a suggestion for the writers:  if you are trying to give me subtle hint as to what the ""surprise"" ending will be, don't repeatedly beat me over the head with a baseball bat, as it loses its effect.Bottom line:  Swordfish's action is spread too thin to hold the attention of any action junkies, but some things do blow up real good.  And let's not forget Halle.   Matinee.P.S.  Berry and her staff claim there was no bonus for the breast baring.",Swordfish

It's a truly bland and forgettable action flick with unmemorable characters and an unbelievable script. I think it will appeal only to the lowest common denominator. I wasted my money watching it, definitely. It wasn't incredibly horrible, but infuriatingly mediocre. I thought it would be more fun, but I was disappointed. It lacked joy, excitement, and comedy. It left me feeling depressed and not entertained. Perhaps it's worth watching for those in the mood for a thoroughly brainless action movie.

105,billybrown41,Awesome movie. Plain and simple.,10,11 July 2001,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I saw it with a group of friends and we all loved it.  It was the perfect way too kill a hot Summer afternoon.  John Travolta seemed to be having a blast in a way over the top role and Hugh Jackman did great as the good guy.  I also like seeing Don Cheadle in everything he's in.  This was actually pretty original for an action movie. The plot moved along at a break-neck speed, the twists and turns come fast, and the music rocked.  The action scenes are a force to be reckoned with. Dominic Sena did a great job directing this.  I can't wait to see what he does next.  If you liked ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" it's safe to say that you'll like this too.",Swordfish
106,shaun98,"Not great art, but good fun",7,10 May 2002,"There is little in ""Swordfish"" that could be defended by any artistic standard. However, that is of no consequence. Simply see it for what it is--good entertainment--and you'll do fine. Storywise, it's pretty silly, and not particularly original, but director Dominic Sena wisely refuses to take anything seriously. He just goes with the flow, delivering a fast-paced, slick-looking action movie. It doesn't overstay its welcome, nor does it pretend to be something it's not.Although John Travolta gets first billing, the real star is Hugh Jackman. He lends conviction and authority to his role, anchoring the film even during its least plausible moments. Halle Berry makes an excellent piece of eye candy, and the movie makes absolutely no apologies for portraying her in various states of undress. Don Cheadle adds solid support as a bemused FBI agent. However, Vinnie Jones is wasted as a henchman. Travolta himself sure enjoyed this role, that much can be said. For the most part, it's a fairly standard ""bad guy"" performance, but an entertaining one, to be sure. However, he gets a chance to stretch his acting chops a bit during the now-legendary opening monologue, an excellent piece of work by itself. I give ""Swordfish"" good marks, simply because it does what it set out to do. It's well-crafted and surprisingly brief, given the bloated running times of most modern blockbusters. While the ending wraps things up too neatly, it's still all in good fun.*** (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.",Swordfish
107,vasco_cid,Hugh Jackman scores again!!!,10,3 January 2002,"The storyline is nothing new, it's a mix between some action /thriller movie's from the early and late 90ies. The plot lines are drawn mainly over a skilled computer hacker and his fight for the custody of her daughter. What he needs is a large amount of money to pay the proper attorney to help him win the case in court. The money that Stanley (Jackman) needs comes up in the sculptural Ginger (Berry) who offers Stanley a large amount of money just to meet her boss (Travolta), and the other huge amount comes when the work is finished. The boss believes himself to be patriot and defend his country, but he is nothing different from the terrorists he fights against. The story turns upside down, no one is who we thought they were. By seeing this movie one can clearly remember the smash hit `Matrix', the three main roles are similar Hugh Jackman plays Keanu Reeves; John Travolta plays Laurence Fishbourne and Halle Berry plays Carrie Ann Moss. It's evident that by everyone Swordfish is sunk next to the Matrix, mainly because it doesn't present us 0 gravity fights, no message capable of changing society. But what it offers us is non stop action, thousands of explosions and more action (the initial sequence of the explosion is representative of that) The cast is very strong, although John Travolta could have been replaced by somebody else. This movie is clearly the high point on his career. As for Hugh Jackman, he shows the viewer, that he is not only an actor in these kinds of movies because of his pretty face on women hysteria, he shows that he really knows how to act, he proved it last year (on the fantastic X MEN), as did his mutant partner Halle Berry. Swordfish is also rewarding in the end presenting us with a twist, that fits perfectly. This is one of the greatest hits of the year, come the sequels!!! 8 out of 10",Swordfish

For anyone who is computer literate - or even typewriter literate - there is so much to this film that is not only embarassing to watch but is truly cringe-worthy. Even if you set aside all the BS histrionics that Jackon has been given to do, why did they not hire someone who knows how to type for the closeup keyboard shots?
This bogus-tech stuff totally ruins the movie. If that section had been done better, this could have been in the same league as Heat - tight, serious, and intelligent. Seriously, the tech BS truly shoots this otherwise great movie down in flames.

I know the internet was not new in 2001 when this came out, but for me it was around the time that I really first started understanding and exploring it. But beyond the personal attraction of this movie, I really liked the plot. I thought the way that they were stealing the money was cool and it really interested me.Another thing that I love is the characters in this movie. John Travolta is at the top of his game and dose a remarkable job with Gabriel; he's bad, yet cool. Mean, yet intriguing. Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry also are good in their roles.As I said, there can be some ""yeah right"" moments (especially the end) but those can be overlooked.

113,Captain Ed,A good time interrupted by ridiculous events,6,17 July 2002,"I avoided watching Swordfish mostly because this genre tends to rely much too heavily on slow-motion explosions and ridiculous shoot-out scenes. After watching it last night, these things are certainly true, but the movie manages to be entertaining anyway.John Travolta, who can be terrific (Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction) and horrible (Battlefield Earth) and all shades in between, does a credible job here as Gabriel, a man at the center of several conspiracies.  Hugh Jackman is oddly cast as a busted hacker who gets corraled into doing a job so that he can fight his ex-wife for custody of his daughter.  Halle Berry plays a woman who seems to be playing both sides of the street.  While all three do good work, Jackman just isn't believable as a hacker -- he's too square, to use an outdated term.The story starts off with a bang (literally) and looks promising.  What should have been its central theme -- how far should we go to protect ourselves from terrorists and at what cost -- was timely when the movie was released and is even more timely now.  However, Swordfish doesn't spend nearly enough time on this as it does several ridiculous action set pieces, including a combined shoot-out and car chase about an hour or so into the movie.  The type of crime being committed in the movie would be a secret for about five minutes, tops, if these kind of shenanigans were occurring all around it.  Also, the computer scenes that make up the backbone of the film are completely unrealistic.  Hacker programs are shown that would have taken several years to design, just for the graphics -- who would bother?  Hackers program in code, and while it might be boring to look at, it can be very effective.  These scenes where little blocks float around the screen, with Jackman reacting wildly to their placement, is just ridiculous.  If you're going to make a gritty action movie and base it in reality, stuff like this just jars you right out of the flick.Other than that, you can munch popcorn to this movie just as well as you can The Mummy and other entertaining but seriously flawed action movies.

114,das417,Halle Berry was distracting in a bad way,5,21 December 2004,"Honestly, the only thing that bothered me the most about this movie was Halle Berry. Though I am a man and like most other men find her attractive, I thought she was more distracting. Why was her half naked body necessary for this movie? It was as if her body was needed to carry those parts of the movie which weren't going to go anywhere so she was needs to add extra spice.I was actually surprised to see that Hugh Jackman was also starring (I didn't pay attention to the box, it was 1100 at night and wanted something to watch). Sorry, I don't see Hugh Jackman as a world famous hacker. He was fun to watch I suppose, but do world famous hackers look like him? The plot itself was interesting, though it turned into nothing more then a regular Hollywood movie with explosions and, as mentioned above, half naked women. Too bad, because the idea of Travolta's character was interesting and if given a different movie it would have been much better.I remember when this movie came out and the 9/11 politics. I didn't see the movie then and watching it now it seems like that was overrated. Thinking about the occupation of Iraq however almost changes the one looks at this movie.",Swordfish

Now, the problem is, the four things mentioned above are the ONLY good bits about the entire 1-hour-35-minute movie!

117,darkjosh,A Fishy Tale,6,13 June 2001,"""Well,"" I thought, ""It can't be as bad as Gone in 60 Seconds,"" as I shelled out my money for a matinee viewing of Swordfish, and thankfully it wasn't. Still, Sena just barely manages to do more than just clone 60 Seconds in this outing, elevating it with frenetic action sequences.Swordfish is a mindless film with a script going in so many directions it forgets that though the story is  silly, it has to be filled with realistic characters. The plot involves an ex-hacker (Jackman) who is contracted by a powerful terrorist's (Travolta) girlfriend (Berry) to help write a computer code to break into a federal bank and steal billions of dollars.  They woo him with the promise of helping him attain custody of his daughter.The plot may sound simple and mindless, and it is, except that the filmmakers decide to try and twist every possible discernible aspect they can of it, attempting to impress the audience with the ambiguity of it all. To twist a plot is one thing, to mangle it into a heaping mess of indecipherability is another.  What makes Swordfish watchable is the energy of the action sequences as Travolta's sometimes funny and effective lines.  The beginning of the film, in which Travolta dissects Dog Day Afternoon and the expectations of audiences certainly makes it seem as if writer Skip Woods would deliver an intelligent action flick - but he doesn't.  Thankfully, however,  there are some great scenes with audaciously over-the-top action that immensely help the film, including a shattering hostage situation, a kinetic car chase aided by some loud, almost tangible sound effects, and a helicopter dragging a city bus amidst downtown LA.In the end, Sena wastes a formidable cast in this empty outing, a clear exercise in style over substance.  Sure, he's got Travolta, Jackman, Cheadle, and Barry, but with nothing to work with, the actors seem almost uninterested.  You can have a top-notch cast, but a weak script can crush it.

The twists and turns were somewhat confusing and badly translated to the audience. The ideas were good but not great. The lack of straight-forwardness was its weakness. Although it was admirable in its attempt to make a smart thick laid plot, its actually hurting the film by going overboard. Too many hints, too many times when it expects the audience to figure everything out. Of course if you dumb yourself up and just enjoy the ride (which i think is what you're suppose to do) then this movie was outstanding. The action scenes were exciting and believable, the acting was good, and the sex appeal in it was very close to top notch.I never thought of Halle Berry as that attractive although all my friends seem to think so. I never thought she was that good looking but in this movie for the first time I though she was hot, of course it helped when she had no top on. Hugh Jackman has convinced everyone that he's a more-than capable actor. Halle Berry sustains her sex-appeal-draw power. Travolta resustains his action movie skills after the laughable BFE. Don Cheadle plays the most convincing law enforcement official yet again. So like I said, the plot which is the backbone to every movie, was confusing and weak. The action kind of makes up for it.

Their lives intersect in a plot to steal $9.5 billion from a secret DEA account, and from start to finish we never know just who exactly are the good guys and who are the villains.

I will say that the performances are astonishing. Hugh Jackman is well casted for the lead and Halle Berry is really good as well.

124,MadReviewer,"Some Really Cool Scenes, But Overall, A Convoluted Mess",5,23 July 2001,"`Swordfish' is a film most likely made by rich action movie fans for not-so-rich action movie fans.  `Swordfish' features all the right elements of a terrific action film  cutting-edge special effects, jaw-dropping car chases, lots o' blazing guns, gorgeous babes, and tense races against time that invariably involve a countdown from a digital clock. However, for whatever reason, when added together these elements don't add up to a particularly good overall movie.  `Swordfish' contains a lot of undeniably great scenes, but as an overall movie . . . it's okay.  Not exactly a dog, but not exactly good, either.The convoluted plot of `Swordfish' boils down to this:  Mystery man Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) and his drop-dead gorgeous sidekick Ginger Knowles (Halle Berry) recruit former computer whiz Stan Jobson (Hugh Jackman) to break into a top secret government computer in order to access files on something called `Operation: Swordfish'.  FBI Agent A.D. Roberts (Don Cheadle), who has been keeping tabs on Stan's activities, becomes aware of the mysterious Gabriel's plans and begins a dogged attempt to stop him. Throughout all this, hints about Gabriel's `true' identity keep cropping up, leaving his mercenary programmer Stan to keep wondering who he's really working for: maybe a criminal mastermind, maybe a corrupt government agent  or perhaps something worse.  The opening of `Swordfish' is one of the best opening scenes of any action movie ever filmed: the set-up is brilliant (not to mention wicked cool), the dialogue crackles with razor-sharp wit, the use of freeze-motion photography is spectacular, and it pulls no punches whatsoever.  It even makes some subtle and not-so-subtle references to the Al Pacino film `Dog Day Afternoon', which is so eerily appropriate that it's perfect (although I found myself wondering how many people watching the film would even have heard of `Dog Day Afternoon', let alone know what it was about).  It's so high-energy, you get the feeling you're in for one of the best action films of all time.  Trouble is, the rest of the film can't even remotely sustain such energy, so `Swordfish' begins to quickly slide downwards into pure mediocrity.  It never hits the point where it becomes unwatchably bad, but it never reaches the heights of the opening scenes again, either.As far the overall story itself . . . well, if you take each individual scene and watch them on all on their own merits, they're all pretty cool. (Note:  `cool' doesn't always mean `good', but it usually means `fun'). String them all together and watch them all at once, though, and it becomes painful how little sense `Swordfish' makes.  What's said and done in one scene blatantly contradicts the story and plot in another scene, plot threads are arbitrarily dropped and forgotten, critical information explaining parts of the story seems to be pulled from out of nowhere when characters are stuck in a jam . . . there's no sense of cohesion to the film at all.  It's as though the writers of this film had a brainstorming meeting, wrote down as many cool ideas for an action film as they could think of, and then crammed every single one of those ideas into the script without giving the slightest amount of thought as to whether or not those ideas would actually work together in the same film.  `Swordfish' is a mishmash of some cool images and some very cool dialogue that fail to ultimately blend together into a cool film.  (And a side rant regarding the storyline  there's a whole subplot involving Hugh Jackman's character Stan and his fight to get custody of his daughter that's utterly ludicrous and unnecessary to the story.  Memo to the scriptwriters  it doesn't matter if Stan's a convicted white-collar criminal; there's no way a judge would let the kid's mother have sole custody rights if the mother is a known porn star making porn movies in the house where the kid is supposed to live!!!!  Talk about beyond dumb . . .)Dominic Sena does a decent job with the direction of the film  `Swordfish' moves along with the cheerful breakneck pace of a runaway rollercoaster  but he doesn't do anything to particularly distinguish himself from the rest of the Bruckheimer pack (Michael Bay, Simon West, et al.)  There's nothing wrong with this; it just would've been neat to see what `Swordfish' would've been like if directed by someone bring a little extra to the table.  The effects, the pacing, and the choice of some of the shots are undeniably cool, though, so it's safe to say that Sena has most likely entrenched himself as a top action director for some time with `Swordfish'.The characters?  Travolta's in his element as Gabriel Shear  the man's a shadow (figuratively, anyway) of what he used to be, but if you need someone to play a hip, arrogant, pop-culture spewing villain, Travolta's your man. The guy chews the scenery with relish as the Machiavellian Gabriel; he's clearly in his element in this film and loving every second of it.  In a way, it's a shame  I think John Travolta is capable of much better than this  but he gives the part of Gabriel in `Swordfish' everything it needs and then some.  Hugh Jackman is good, if not exactly great, as Stan the hacker; the deficiencies of his part, though, seem to be more the script than Jackman himself.  Halle Berry . . . Wow.  With a capital W.  The part of Ginger Knowles doesn't exactly call for Oscar-winning talent, but it does call for an amazingly beautiful woman who knows how to show off her assets, and Ms. Berry does exactly what the part requires to perfection.  The only disappointment to the cast is Don Cheadle, and it's not that he does a bad job, it's just that he's so obscenely talented compared to the rest of the cast and the weak script he's forced to work with, it's laughable. Cheadle's simply too good for the part of A.D. Roberts.  He's clearly slumming in this movie; the producers of `Swordfish' almost would've been better off with a much less talented actor playing Don Cheadle's part. Every scene that Cheadle's in, he simply outshines every other actor to the point where it's embarrassing.Is `Swordfish' great?  Certainly not.  Does it have some a few moments? Yes, with emphasis on `a few'.  For that reason alone, it's probably worth renting . . . but only if you're in the mood for forgettable, mindless fun. Grade: C/C+",Swordfish
125,Pamsanalyst,"Don't take this seriously, but",4,6 January 2005,"way back in 1949 Carol Reed made the ultimate film about an amoral man who was going to give work to an old friend, but when the old friend arrived in Vienna he found his new boss dead, run over by a truck. After a half-day in the town, the new arrival becomes convinced his friend was murdered, and sets out to clear the reputation of the amoral man with the police. The film, and novel that was written by Graham Greene, also has a moral policeman and a beautiful woman who was in love with the deceased.So somewhere out there in screenwriter land, someone genius said to his word processor, 'what if Holly Martins had arrived while Harry Lime was still alive?' and rather than watered penicillin, a problem long past us, Lime's vogue was using computers to steal billions. It's a start, but then he had to put up with a lead who will not do total villains anymore, so he had to drag in an anti-terrorist bit.I can see the story conference now, like something out of Sunset Boulevard or The Player: well if we jazz it up with lots of special effects and loud noise, no one will notice.",Swordfish

The special effects were absolutley incredible, the acting was brilliant, and the writing was very bizarre. In fact, John Travolta's monologue in the opening scene was very slick because of the way he explained Hollywood's policys and styles of filmmaking. I also thought that the directing by Dominic Sena (Gone in Sixty Seconds) was very well done, and the producing by Joel Silver (The Matrix 1, 2, 3) couldn't have been better.A recently jailed computer hacker named Stanley (Hugh Jackman) has been living in Texas on parole and has just had a visitor. His visitor was a sexy DEA agent named Ginger (Halle Berry) who has given him an offer that will reward him millions. Her offer was to have Stanley go to Los Angeles and meet a terrorist named Gabriel (John Travolta). When Stanley accepts the job, he meets Gabriel and discovers that Gabriel wants him to hack in codes to banks that will transfer unused government funds to Gabriel's account so that Gabriel can develop a whole new technology and intensity to terrorism throughout the world.I love the first action sequence of the movie because it was the same camera concept Joel Silver used for The Matrix when Keanu Reeves dodges the bullets.I honestly hope that Joel Silver will produce a sequel to Swordfish and have Dominic Sena come back to direct it.Produced by Joel Silver, and directed by Dominic Sena, Swordfish is a knockout thriller that was one of the best movies of the summer of 2001!",Swordfish

The only way it could have been improved would have been to have lots more gratuitous shots of Halle Berry in lots of different underwear and lots of gratuitous shots of Halley Berry topless as seeing her breasts for the first time on film/in a film and in underwear (even though she was unfortunately wearing a thong) were easily the two best parts of this rubbish! Now for me to type the previous sentence just proves how bad this film is!

Aided and abetted by lovely Halle Berry. Its a non stop action thriller without a great deal of sense to the plot, but one has to admit like the ""Die Hards"" its quite fun to watch. It starts on a very high level of action, which uses excellent digital techniques to give the beginning quite a bang. Its rather hard for the story to keep up the same pace after this tear away beginning, however there are some great action sequences to come including the now famous helicopter bus hijack through city buildings. Travolta is his usual cool self, enjoys and makes the most of a typical role, doing what he can with the limited dialogue. Jackman is OK in his part, Halle Berry mainly gives the show its needful glamor, while the gratuitous display of her breasts no doubt helps ratings go up a notch.

The plot line keeps you thinking and you don't know what will happen until the end unless you are really good and figuring things like this out.  However, this movies starts toward the end of the plot then starts over.  Kind of a ""half"" flashback type of thing. This really hurt the film and could have been left out all together!  John Travolta is and excellent villain.  Halle Berry is pretty good and his accomplice. However, she could use a little more practice in this type of role.  There were a few times where I felt she was working a little too hard on this attempting to play the secret agent or under cover agent at times. Overall she was able to carry her character well.  Hugh Jackman was down to earth and smart.  He carried his character well.  The affects were pretty good and for the most part realistic. However, the bus scene with the cargo chopper sticks out.  The cargo chopper could lift the bus but once two of the lines broke, the two remaining lines would have would have yanked the hard points on the bus right out.  The bus is just too heavy for suspended by two hard points.  Three maybe, but two, no way.

137,Global_Marketing_Pros,"Predictability, verse survival instincts at the level of Government",10,28 May 2006,"Swordfish is a prediction within a prediction, thats why it starts where it ends. Prediction in the movie The Matrix urges neo to seek the oracle so that they may advise neo of predictability within the matrix. The matrix itself seems to be defined by what actor John Travolta in Swordfish explains as negotiation with those who would take what they want. Of course in The Matrix this seems to be acted out by Agent Smith and associates. Similar aggression with telekinetic ESP powers also seem most dramatical evident in the Minority Report with actor Tom Cruise as an agent for the Government.Swordfish is a wonderfully creative action film of power and control. Which is what every excellent field commander salivates over and dreams of accomplishing every night for the following day. In the movie The Matrix Morpheus, also known as God of dreams, portrays an elusive shadowy character holding the keys to Agent Smiths' freedom. Prehaps its the culture gap, as evident in custom, between what the citizen wants and what the Government demands. Subliminal character development exists throughout the film for this contrast of characters.Again the opening of Swordfish seems subliminal as well. Misdirection of light is reflection, and another meaning for reflection is wisdom. Just as a wise film editor can predict how a film is perceived by a market audience so can wise people predict the actions of a government within a theater of military operations dictated by logistical command. What if the theater of operations logistical equation is simplified? Unconventional wisdom called upon. Unorthodox morals and ethics manipulated. Then is the aggressor preforming a ""special"" tactical and strategical execution with command decisions? Or is the commander a sadistic capitalist? Of course in Swordfish the same non pervasive element in both cinematic vision and warfare seems to me to be Surprise. Well the movie ends, the commander lives. The operation recorded as SWORDFISH.",Swordfish

Remember when you were a kid and it sounded like a really good idea to mix all the fountain sodas together in one cup? ""Swordfish"" is the cinematic equivalent, a graveyard pastiche of pointlessness.Viewers should also be aware that, in light of recent events, ""Swordfish"" is particularly objectionable for certain events it depicts, and for its glib invocation (and even, arguably, condoning) of terrorism. One begins to understand how depraved we must appear to some who might see this, and 'entertainments' like it, and have no reason not to consider them as indicative of our entire culture.To top it off, ""Swordfish"" is even ugly to look at, metallic and antiseptic, with as much artistry as you'd expect from a beer commercial.",Swordfish
139,TexMetal4JC,The best action movie of all time.,10,16 June 2001,"Although the headline sounds childish, I'm afraid in this case it is not hyperbole or short-lived excitement. Perhaps a second viewing would change my mind, but right now I feel that SWORDFISH, John Ttravolta's latest movie with which to resurrect his career, has created a unique combination to place it at the top of the action movie genre.Not only does Swordfish have an original plot, and a nice plot twist towards the end, but it also has great acting from its trio of good-looking stars, excellent Alfred Hitchcock-style directing and a healthy dose of suspense.The opening scene is one of the best ever filmed, certainly up there with Psycho's shower scene and The Phantom of the Opera's silent unmasking. Following the opener is an extended flashback, which works in several subplots -- amazing for an action movie. The flashback is followed by a reprise of the opening scene (another shining moment of the movie) and the climax.Now granted, this IS an action movie, so these aforementioned subplots aren't developed into epic proportions. Neither is the plot incredibly complex. But the plot is certainly much more complex than everyone's favorite all-CGI, no-plot movie (Crouching Tiger, Hidden  Dragon), as well as a slew of other popular action flicks (M:I-2, Gone in 60 Second, Con Air). The plot is similar in style to The Rock, featuring a bad guy who isn't quite all bad. And the special effects actually don't rip off the Matrix that much (a la Art of War, a good but underrated movie, and M:I-2).
In fact, the FX are spectacular, quite frankly. The opening scene's use of a 360-degree camera angle to catch all the action is stunning, and is more innovative than most post-Hitchcockian directing. And the special effects abound throughout the movie of course: Gun fights, car chases, gun fights in the middle of car chases, flying buses, exploding people, etc etc etc.
Those who pan Swordfish for being short on plot and long on ripoffs obviously expected Casablanca and received Halloween. In comparison with other movies in its genre, Swordfish measures up ahead thanks to an original and engaging plot, superb acting and directing (Dominic Sena has certainly matured since Gone in 60 Seconds), and fantastic special effects.What more can you ask (other than to see Halle Berry topless of course)? But when John Travolta opens this movie with the line, ""You know what the problem with Hollywood is? They make [crap],"" he obviously wasn't referring to Swordfish.

Travolta is the penultimate charismatic bad guy, and that alone makes this movie worth watching.Halle Berry's role didn't impress me much, though I do think she's a good actress (see Introducing Dorothy Dandridge). Don Cheadle didn't bring anything unique to his role either and Sam Shepard's character wasn't even necessary, but Hugh Jackman was great. There haven't been many movies I've seen where he impresses me a whole lot, but this was one of them. And, yes, I have to admit, the fact that he is so yummy in this movie probably turned my head a little...Getting back to Travolta, he is so good at playing really freaky sinister characters while still maintaining that friendly, bubbleheaded Vinnie Barbarino demeanor (which makes the character that much more disturbing)...and that crazy facial hair is a nice touch. I generally like more thought-provoking fare that's more driven by plot than explosions, but Swordfish is one of the few exceptions to that rule.Guys: catch this flick because it's a good guy flick, and because Halle Berry shows off the wonderful work of her cosmetic surgeon, while leaving very little to the imagination.Gals: Hugh Jackman.

142,stefan-144,Bad start leads to lightweight end,4,8 January 2003,"There's a start, a middle and an end. The middle is Ok, with lots of action and suspense mostly carried by Travolta's skilled performance - but the other two are way off.Just as with the whole universe itself, the start is crucial to how things in a movie will work out. First of all, we need to care. That's hard to do, when Swordfish starts with exploding an innocent woman, and then moving to an ex-hacker who misses his daughter. How could we care?He goes on like that - people die right and left, and he just wants to get custody of his daughter, so he's quite ready to help a sociopath predator get USD 9 billion to play with.Also, it's really hard to see Hugh Jackman, who looks like an ad for an aftershave, as a hacker. Really hard, even when he hacks on the keyboard with FF speed.They should have dared to let the hacker be a nerdish guy, which would have made him a much brighter contrast to the action going on around him, and they should have started the movie with him as a hacker with ideals, still living with his daughter.They should have done a lot of things with the script, before starting to shoot it. Now, it's a mess, breaking apart wherever scrutinized. People jump in and out of character, if they have one to begin with, and the plot twists like a worm on the hook.The DVD gives two alternative endings, just as meaningless and lightweight as the one in the movie. That should have alerted the movie makers. If they really don't feel how the movie must end, then something is wrong with the beginning.Ignoring the story, one can still enjoy some shootouts and other fancy action stuff - and especially, Travolta's doubtless competence in creating a character, even when unsupported by just about everything around him.",Swordfish

This movie is very entertaining if you like non-stop action in a cool high-tech environment.The ingredients are pretty standard. There's a stylish kick-ass villain (Travolta) with a plan, being a high-tech bank robbery. This is all garnished with lots of weapons, technology, car chases and beautiful women. This movie really delivers on the action front, I don't think there's any 'quiet' scene that lasts more than 2 minutes. It also contains the now standard implausible hacking scenes, where getting into the computer system of a bank involves solving a kind of Rubik's cube on your computer screen. I hope you're not offended by product placement because a certain computer brand is quite prominent when IT hardware is involved in this movie. But it's by far not as obnoxious as in ""I, Robot"".The filming is top-notch, unlike some other movies you can actually see what's happening in the action scenes (which is sometimes due to the amazing slow-down effects in some scenes). Unfortunately the entire plot becomes quite thin when the movie is stripped of all this action and style. However, it works.

151,Mrswing,"Sick, sick, sick...",1,22 June 2001,"SPOILER WARNING : this movie has the most repulsive morality I have seen in a LONG time. We are supposed to root for a heroic villain with despicable methods (slaughtering innocent bystanders) just to keep the American way of life safe, no matter what the cost. The fact that all these innocents are considered as pawns by the filmmakers, not even given a shred of individuality or humanity, just shows how utterly immoral and dishonest the whole enterprise is. If this is what the action movie has stooped to, then maybe the whole genre should be put in the cooler for a few years. And the writer obviously never heard of the saying 'patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel'. Instead, in the world of Swordfish Might Makes Right, and any terrorist attacks on Americans are 'rightly' avenged on an innocent civilian population. Apart from this moral point of view which will play really badly outside of the US (but then, who cares about the population of 5 other continents, right?), the movie as a whole is disappointing. The plot never makes much sense, the emotional aspects of the story are forgotten quickly and clumsily developed. Hugh Jackman should go very far, he is reminiscent of the younger Mel Gibson and a magnetic screen personality. Unfortunately, the character is so underwritten that he spends the last 40 minutes scowling desperately, rather than being allowed to actually act. Add some excessive CGI which diminishes rather than enhances the spectacle, some really bad one-liners and an unfortunate penchant for ridiculous sub-Tarantino monologues about movies (geek country - would any rogue superspy REALLY spend his time thinking about the difference between Hollywood movies and real life? Of course not. But slacker video clerks would), and you are left with a subpar action movie which leaves a truly foul taste in the mouth. Any good points?

153,pc_dean,Slog Day Afternoon,5,9 June 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ""Swordfish"" begins with John Travolta, star of ""Battlefield Earth"", expounding on how modern movies are poorly written, poorly executed crap, as irony-alarms ring from here to Culver City.  He laments that ""Dog Day Afternoon"" was a letdown because Al Pacino wasn't ruthless enough to splatter a few hostages to get what he wanted.  It soon dawns on you that what you're hearing is not dialogue, but a mission statement.Sure enough, the speech takes place during a bank-hostage-crisis, wherein Travolta and his crew detonate a bomb-wrapped hostage to demonstrate their seriousness of intent, in a gory, technically impressive 360-pan that we are treated to not once, but twice.  From there the movie flashes back to show how everything got to this point in the first place.The story concerns paroled hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman, far superior to his material), who is contacted by Travolta's operative, played by Halle Berry, and then given a lurid ""interview"" that involves cracking a DoD system in one minute with a gun to his head and a hooker servicing him orally.  This scene is so over-the-top that even the most lascivious viewers will be left scratching their heads.  The Bad Guys want Stan to help them steal $9.5 billion that has piled up in a secret government account.  This is all part of a plot masterminded, as such plots always are in movies, by an evil, folksy, vaguely Republican senator living in Northern Virginia. Travolta and Sen. Evil (R-VA) aim to use the money to finance a secret war against terrorism, which means we're in for several tiresome speeches about the abuse of innocents for ""the greater good"".  ""If they kill American tourists,"" Travolta says, ""we tac-nuke an entire city."" (I bet you wondered why that keeps happening.)  While all this is happening, a beleaguered Fed (Don Cheadle, always welcome) and a squad of agents from the FBI field office on Mars (where you routinely carry guns in interrogation rooms and refer to the ""Assistant Director"") are trying to sniff out the scam.Stanley is necessary to penetrate the computer security of the account, which for script reasons has to be done from the computer of another bank, thus necessitating the bank crisis in the opening.  Stanley asks at one point why they don't just access the bank's computer over the phone lines, and no one gives him an answer.  Presumably, it's because then they wouldn't get to blow up a crying woman hostage surrounded by a squad of cops.  It's not always smart to have your characters point out holes in your own script.Travolta plays rogue agent Gabriel Shear with his patented ""Broken Arrow"" brand of glib psychosis.  Travolta is one of the few actors who can deliver a speech that is at once earnest and self-mocking, but the dialogue here isn't up to par.  Halle Berry is essentially wasted (as she was in ""X-Men""). She flashes her upper assets in a pointless scene, and then strangely disappears from the second act.Like most music-video directors, Dominic Sena can tell a flashy visual story, and the look of the film is nicely sleek and shiny.  But the engine driving it repeatedly spits and starts.  The computer lingo sounds forced and strange, even to my digital-dumb ears.  At one point, Stan is asked how he managed to crack a program so quickly.  ""I don't know,"" he says, ""I just see the code in my head.""  This is supposed to sound mystical (I kept waiting for Laurence Fishburne to show up and say there is no spoon), but it really sounds like the writer doesn't know either.There are some twists to the story, and some of them are genuinely surprising, due to the fact that the foreshadowing clues dropped throughout the movie are easily mistaken for sloppy writing.  There is a nifty car chase, although it owes more to PlayStation than ""French Connection."" Nothing is what it seems, and deep, meticulously-planned conspiracy attempts to bridge gaps in the plot and justify the ludicrous finale.It's nice to see the title, which is an homage to the archetypical ""secret password"" in countless old movies.  Most of them were better than this one.",Swordfish
154,ghigau,It never lives up to the opening.,6,5 July 2001,"The cinematography and special effects start the film dramatically, then they pretty much disappear. After the spectacular start, it is just another movie about a bad guy taking over a little part of the world. Its brutality and cruelty keep your blood flowing, but all the dramatics are about stealing less than Bill Gates makes in a day. Big deal. The casting finds two total studs who also are top computer geniuses. Did they stop by MIT recently to check out the student body? I am pretty certain that the world's top computer hackers are not a major draw on the beaches of Nice. These guys looks like the most important feature of their day is making sure their socks match their tie as they refuse to mingle with anyone not at least as cool and beautiful as themselves. The movie also left me wondering if it is another Scientology project. It was a little too much ""do what you want in life; screw everyone else."" At some level, it is a shame we let John Travolta get away with as much as he does. As long as he makes money for the studio ...",Swordfish
155,huggybear-2,Slick but meaningless techno caper,6,31 July 2001,"Films involving hacking or other technology can be dangerous - too realistic and viewers would fall asleep - too inaccurate and they become meaningless. Swordfish falls squarely in the latter category.There are plenty of nice ingredients - the normal conspiracy / who's working for who character set, Halle Berry going topless, John Travolta looking moody, Hugh Jackman going from strength from strength as a leading man of the future and Don Cheadle doing his normal good cop routine.However, the basis of the film, Jackman hacking into $9billion for Travolta's campaign against terrorism, is a total mess.  The script is meaningless, the sequences laughable and the outcome predictable. 
There are holes in the plot large enough to fly a bus through (fortunate, as it turns out) and these caused me serious problems in enjoying the experience.  Vinnie Jones is utterly superfluous as only crony with dialogue and the ending is too pat.It could have been so good too, but too much money spent on pretty visuals and not enough on plot and script...you would never guess it was produced by Joel Silver.Disappointing.",Swordfish
156,robert-300,A lame techno thriller,2,8 September 2003,"* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantWARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*A counter terrorist orginisation called Black Cell which is headed by the charismatic,yet ruthless Gabriel Shear(John Travolta) plans to hack in to a dummy corporation which was shut down by the DEA in 1986.Over the years the corporation codenamed SWORDFISH has amassed a fortune worth $9.5 billion in interest.With the money Shear plans to fund his groups personal war against global terrorism.To help him achieve his goal he hires Stanley Jobson(Hugh Jackman),a convicted computer hacker who has just been released on parole.All Jobson wants is to see his estranged daughter who lives with his ex-wife.The only problem is Jobson cannot afford the legal fees so that he can see her, explaining his motivation behind doing the job for Shear.Jobson's task is made all the more difficult by CIA Agent Roberts(Don Cheadle)who is forever shadowing him.It's not long  before Jobson's daughter's life comes in to the equation.Putting more pressure on our hero.'Swordfish' had a short lived stay at the box office.Mainly due to the fact that it was pulled from cinemas as a result of the tragic terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York on September 11th.Understandable considering the delicate subject matter. I was one of those few punters who managed to see the movie before the events of that fateful day and to say that he movie being pulled was of no great loss is a bit of an understatement in my view.
Opening promisingly with a jaw dropping explosion which uses the astonishing bullet time effects that were used to such mesmerising effect in 'The Matrix',Director Dominic Sena's movie sadly falls apart after that.Sena who gave us the lack-lustre remake of 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' with Nicholas Cage makes another blunder with this turkey.Another flick where substance takes a back seat to the substance.What with it's retro/thrah metal soundtrack for starters and occasional action sequence how could this be anything but a victim of style taking over from a decent plot.Which Sena had attemped to produce at first.The problem with the movie is that is just so uninspired and doesn't really offer anything new.(apart from the fact that the villains are this time a counter terrorist organisation).Cliche after cliche is hurled at the screen.The charismatic villain,the femme fatale who hangs on his arm but is supposedly attracted to the hero,the hero has a daughter who he wants to see and is eventually exploited so the villains get their own way.Even the movies jaw dropping yet stupid scene near the end involving a bus being hauled through the city streets can do little to rescue the film.Plus the movies supposed twist in it's denounment just had me leaving the theatre scratching my head in bewilderment.Needless to say I wouldn't give it to much thought.I didn't in the end.Why the cast agreed to star in this bunch of baloney is beyond me.A mostly good cast which comprised of John Travolta putting in another villanous turn as the venomous Gabriel Shear was sadly wasted.Travolta although as good as he is doesn't seem to have muck luck when it comes to playing villains.Although fantastic in his earlier action flick 'Broken Arrow' that too was something of a dud.Perhaps he should stick to playing good guys or find a script with a villanous part for him that does justice to his talent as an actor.Hugh Jackman, an actor of effortless charisma was also misued on a script that did him no favors.The austrailian star who was fantastic as the rugged Wolverine in 'X-men' could be a huge star but certainly needs a hit outside of the superhero franchise.His turn as Jobson was great and the actor did a good job of making Jobson a likable hero.Don Cheadle as the CIA agent hot on Jobsons tail wass also wasted while Halle Berry as Ginger the femme fatale who approaches Jobson to do the job is an actress who deserved this kind of film foisted upon her.The less said about her gratuitous topless scene the better.God only knows how much she earned for that little scene alone.Any one who payed the entrance fee to see Vinnie Jones(who was seen in 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' as one of the terrorists will sorely be disappointed as he has little to do or say through out the movie.He comes across as merely the token 'hard' henchman who simply needs to look scary.Not much of a stretch for our Vinnie I have to admit.I won't waste any more of my time or yours going in to why this film was such a let down.Needless to say if you want to see a good thriller that involves terrorism in some way then I would reccommend the far superior 'Arlington Road'.A film with a twist in it's tail that would certainly blow you away.I suggest that Sena take heed as it's a lesson in how a tense,palm seating thriller should be made.Robs Rating: *",Swordfish

161,JohnnyCNote,"Very enjoyable, with an original spin",7,30 January 2003,"While some may want to dismiss this movie as a typical cyber-thriller about hackers and government agents, I found it to be above average and very watchable. Some have also accused it of having heavy sexual content, but in reality there's only one scene in which a sex act takes place, and it's without nudity. Halle Berry does appear sans top in one other scene, but no sex is involved and in a R rated movie it's not to be unexpected. That being said, it's not a film for the entire family.There are some violent scenes, but once again, Swordfish does not pretend to be a family feature. The opening scene is particularly good, and the final chase has a new slant. That alone is unique, for how many times have you seen anything original in chase scenes?I've read elsewhere there really was an operation Swordfish, so there may actually be some authenticity buried in this movie. I should add that I'm not the biggest Travolta fan, but he's very good in this...",Swordfish
162,regular8,"Moof Over, Ahnuld",9,21 January 2002,"I like to think every movie has a message.  The message of Swordfish is, Live Each Day As If It Were Your Last, and Everything You Need To Know To Succeed Is Already In Your Head, So Go Do It.  And where does this message abide within the cells of Swordfish?  Why, in the bad guy, John Travolta's character.  His bad guy goes around doing everything cooly and calmly no mattrer how risky or dangerous, reciting movie plots as food for thought, and just comes out on top so thoroughly it's hard to argue with the man.  I love a character who recites movie plots as if they are real life with lessons for us all.  I mean, how often does it occur to you that your life is like a movie, or IS a movie, or would be better off it it actually was a movie?  Be honest.  Me, about five times a day.This movie Swordfish has enough great action to rival the Action Masters Arnold and James Cameron in, say, True Lies or Bruce Willis in the first Die Hard.  The airborne sequences are great and the car chase definitely rumbles.  Holly Berry gives us all a great shot of her boobs (thank YOU) and at the end of the movie I only wished there was such a bad guy as this running around taking care of certain kinds of business, especially these days after Sept. 11.As I recall, this movie did not get very good reviews when it was released. If that was the case, Jeez Louise why not?  This movie succeeds at everything it tries, it gives us some very interesting characters and for the ladies there's even Hugh Jackman to look at, so I give it high marks. Everyone did a good job, it's action with flavor, explosions with a twist of lime (not lemon) so let's get behind Swordfish and admit that we really wouldn't mind living that movie ourselves a little bit.",Swordfish

I had read a lot of reviews about it beforehand, and that it wasn't very good, so I was hesitant to see it.I was pleasantly surprised though when I walked out of it.  The opening action scene is one of the best I have ever scene and really gets the film going. It's one of the first uses of ""matrix-style camerawork"" that I've seen that really adds to the film and isn't just something that ""looks cool.""  The first explosion is incredible and by the gasps in the audience, most of the people in the theater thought so as well. The chase scene in the film is pretty spectacular as well.The hacking part of it is a little absurd, as are most movies involving hackers, but Jackman is a very convincing actor.One of the best things about this film is the originality in it.  The plot isn't the greatest to come along, but it takes an original turn at terrorism.As with many thrillers, the ending of this film has a twist, fairly similar to ""Wild Things,"" but my only problem was that I had no real clue what was going on after the movie ended, as did most of the people in the audience. We had to talk it out to figure out what the ending was really about, and IMO< this could have been explained a little more thouroughly.",Swordfish

Let's see: ""The Matrix"" was a definitive philosophical action sci-fi movie, ""Romeo Must Die"" was a more than decent kung fu movie... ...and now he's producing, along other production people of the company, a truly ambitious project: Can this movie dethrone the 1995 movie ""Hackers"" as *the* turkey B-movie of techno-thrillers?Unluckily, it doesn't. In this movie, they tried too hard to be *good*.I heard of the movie some time ago and my immediate thoughts when seeing the poster was ""God, this is the cheesiest slogan... ever. This thing is going to stink. Therefore, I have to see this."" My today's trip to the movie theater was prophetic indeed: Row 6, Seat 6, and the movie started at 6 o'clock. When I was going there I noticed John Travolta's name on the poster. Ewwwww. Get the star of ""Battlefield Earth"" to the movie and hitting the rock bottom *is* a weekend seminar.It was particularly ironic that Shear, Travolta's sinister character, starts the movie by talking how Hollywood movies suck because they have *no realism*. This particular movie, for example, does have serious holes in its realism.Computers, programming and security intrusion in the movie have nothing whatsoever to do with reality. (In case you question my competence: I'm a computer geek. I know unrealistic computer-related scenario when I see one.) They sling technobabble around to make them look competent. In the beginning, the ""Finnish"" computer expert just mumbles something incomprehensible. (In case you question my competence: I ought to know my mother tongue.)So far, so good. ""Hackers"" is threatened and scared to death. But they made serious mistakes and fell short...The action scenes are more frequent and look pretty cool. ""Hackers"" had much less action. (Then again, the Movie Operating System things in Hackers looked vastly cooler than they did in this movie. But on that front, this movie wins because of more frequent use of technical-looking terms and numbers on weird places.) This Stanley cracker fellow, under pressure, slips something about cracking computer systems that *actually works in real life*. This destroys their attempt at dethroning Hackers.

The cast is very good. Travolta showed that Battlefield Earth was just a job for fun for him and he showed his real qualities in this movie. Also Hugh and Halle were at their best.

To these people: are you sure you were in the right screen at the cinema? You didn't accidently stumble into Shrek or something like that did you?For a big budget action film this moves surprisingly slowly. Most of the money probably went on getting decent actors like Don Cheadle and Vinnie Jones, (and the once great Travolta) because they certainly can't have been attracted by the god-awful screenplay.As it happens, Travolta is spectacularly awful in this, as his character is exactly the same slightly deranged fast talking megalomaniac we saw in Broken Arrow and Face/Off - and he was equally abonimable in those.Of the many painful and awful plot points, one of the worst was the theme of Hugh Jackoff trying to get his daughter back. This was handled in such a contrived manner I didn't really care less whether she lived or died (probably would have been better if she died).Intriguingly, Travolta begins the film with a monolithic speech about the lack of realism in Hollywood films. I don't know whether this was intended to be a hilarious in-joke or not, but Swordfish is the exact type of film he's moaning about. The action is spectacularly uninteresting, unrealistic, and about as exciting as a blocked toilet, which, in an action film is kind of, you know, important. Particularly at the end, when the bus gets winched by a helicopter, I think I exuded the longest sigh ever recorded in the history of the world.

I simply love John Travolta as the macho bad guy, if you liked him in Broken Arrow you'll like him here again.  Halle Barry no doubt is one of the cutest actresses around and she plays her role of a sexy seducer perfectly.  And finally Hugh Jackman is really well casted as the main character.What I like about Swordfish in particular compared to other action movies is this high-tech macho bad guy atmosphere that hangs around during the entire movie (the film's 'high tech' techno music certainly adding up to this).  It might not have as much explosions as another action film but it has a unique atmosphere.  Especially in the first half of the film this comes out beautifully.  The action scenes near the end with the bus were a bit over the top if you ask me, but apart from that this film is truly great.I gave it a well deserved 9/10 rating.",Swordfish

Two things that really stand out in this film for me is the soundtrack with its nice futuristic fast paced electronic music and the casting. John Travolta is as great as always in his role of the charismatic bad guy. Halle Berry also shows herself from her best side (and no I don't mean the you-know-what scene but I'm talking about her overall appearance throughout the entire film). And Hugh Jackman makes a remarkable performance as our main good guy as well. For the rest there is a minor role for Don Cheadle as well but his character doesn't really add much to the movie.

After last years dismal covering of the classic ""Gone in 60 seconds,"" he returns to direct the profane, bloody, violent, sexually explicit ""Swordfish,"" and he does so with great visual flair and sense of self-awareness.  Sena knows exactly what kind of movie he is making here.  ""Swordfish"" is big, it's loud, it's dumb, but it will keep you interested in the plot for the full two hours.  It's a great example of a movie that knows it's a summer blockbuster and doesn't try to do anything except keep you intrigued enough to stay in the air-conditioned theater for it's duration. Being that I am a film student, I'm usually hyper-critical of movies, especially in the writing department.  That said, I didn't go see this film expecting ""Schindler's list,"" but I was still impressed by the screenplay. It's written in a way that doesn't dumb down the dialogue for the lazier audience members.  The plot has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing at the ending until it reveals itself. From Travolta's disconcerting opening monologue to the blowout ending, this is a high-energy film that doesn't take itself too seriously.

I didn't plan on going to see it today, but I went to the movies with my father and my son. My son wanted to see Tomb Raider again, and after having just seen it yesterday, I thought I would allow my father the joy of seeing Lady Croft in action. (Not that I didnt like Tomb Raider, but thats a whole other movie.)I decided to go see Swordfish based on the time element.This movie got out right after theirs. I was planning on going to see it sooner or later, and Im glad I did it sooner. Im going to see this movie again, I can tell you that now. Like I said before, I love John Travolta as the bad guy. I loved him in Face/Off, and I love him even more as Gabriel. He is the quintessential actor. I saw him on Larry King Live the other evening, and Larry asked him if he has to like every character he plays. John said no, but this one was especially fun. Hugh Jackman was great as Stanley Jobson, the hacker. He seemed to genuinely enjoy his work, which made him a great choice for this role. When you see some actors trying to portray hackers on screen, they come across as stiff and jerky. They dont seem to enjoy what theyre doing. Stanley seemed to honestly enjoy the challenge of hacking, which is exactly why other real life hackers do it. Just to say they can or they did. I got that from his on screen portrayal. He also came across as a loving father. I like that in an actor. If they can do whatever the job is, and still love their kids, I dig that. Halle Berry was wonderful as Ginger. She pulls some tricks on you in this film, but I wont tell you what they are.The special effects were wonderful, from the beginning action sequence (which is hard to pull off in a movie. Try keeping the audience's attention after blowing up 3 people with the largest know Claymore mine known to man) all the way through to the end of the movie, which totally blew me away.

Cheadle is good, so is Jackman, and Travolta sparkles in the role of semi-psychopathic terrorist Gabriel. ...Berry?

177,AP-Project,"Glossy, Yet Intense Action Yarn",7,13 November 2002,"There's a nice air of affluence surrounding Gabriel Shear and his entourage throughout this film. That Euro-chic style is enticing and makes this different than your average action film.  Misdirection is the key theme of the picture, and it is Gabriel's modus operandi. The subtext of the film is, in this world plagued by single-minded terrorists, do we want someone as ruthless as Shear on our side?  More to the point, is it absolutely vital (though we may deny it to ourselves) to have someone like Shear on our side? Travolta, Jackman and Berry are just fine here and seem comfortable in their roles. There are elements of ""The Rock"" and ""Speed,"" but Sena has crafted his own unique picture, and it's quite good. Sena's DVD commentary is logical, demonstrates his knowledge of film, and explains precisely how and why scenes were framed and filmed as they were. He explains how a computer consultant spent a good deal of  time on the set helping to achieve realism in that department.  The worm was made into an image (instead of a set of numbers as it really is) solely to assist in story-telling and add punch to what is, after all, a visual medium.     There were two script-related items that bothered me a bit.  Roberts' gullibility in taking a phone call in the middle of questioning Shear'sprevious computer expert was one gaffe. The other was 3 or more guys rolled down a steep hillside, and yet none of them sprained ankles, or broke any bones after such a long, fast roll. Also, Sena himself acknowledges their clothes should have been dirtier. Despite these minor complaints, I really enjoyed the film, and give it 7.5 out of 10 stars.",Swordfish

Exhibit C the perfect father-daughter relationship in an otherwise dysfunctional world of ruthless types and porn burnouts. Moronic car chases, motiveless foot races, loads of gunfire blowing riddly diddly holes in everything, its like a kids pretend shoot out, all explosions and noise; sort of the A-team where a gun can fire forever and hit wherever it wants, plus stupid dialogue. Exhibit D the scene where the worm is constructed great music, but you might as well put a test card up for all the narrative significance of the visuals. Face it computers are boring and you can't jazz it up. They do interesting things but are as exciting to watch as ice cream melting. Its the concept of what they do and not watching them doing it which equals interesting! The film really looks good and everyone in it but its depressing its so empty of tension after the first scene I just wanted to see what happened and what were the special effects. Films like this need to buck along with pace and layer scene setting sequences one after another. Plus theres got to be a good hook to get the viewer thinking ""if that were a real gun"" or ""what if they were doing 100 kilometers an hour while steering with one hand and shooting with the other"".

It opens with Travolta's character, ex-CIA agent and now rogue spy Gabriel Shear, talking to the camera about the crap Hollywood makes, particularly why Dog Day Afternoon would be a better movie if the bank robbers had successfully gotten away. It then cuts to a strangely similar situation, but much more outlandish and over the top. I won't go into much more detail, except that the opening scene results in one the most jaw dropping explosion I've ever scene in a single movie, which also includes some purely magnificent special effects.Following that scene, the story flashes back to the events that lead up to the heist. Shear, along with the beautiful rogue Ginger (Halle Berry) enlists, and somewhat blackmails, reformed computer hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) to help him in an electronic bank robbery worth precisely $9 billion. Stanley's reward, a simple $10 million payment(who wouldn't want to do it?). Stanley returning as an alleged computer hacker raises the interests of FBI Agent Roberts (Don Cheadle), who once labled Stanley as one of the two most notorious computer hackers in the world.What separates from other action movies, as well as most mindless summer fare, is that it actually contains a good plot in addition to the wonderful action scenes and effects. There's also John Travolta, who delivers another one of his deliciously charasmatic villainous portrayals. Resurrected from the debacle of Battlefield Earth, Travolta is completely back on track in a performance that is really worth the talent he has.Filled with non stop twists and turns at a rapid pace, Swordfish is this summer's best offering, and may go on to be the Best Movie of 2001, at least for me.",Swordfish
180,MovieTrey,It's worth renting,7,20 August 2003,"Swordfish is one of John Travolta's better movies.  After last year's blockbuster flop, Battlefield Earth, it's nice to see that Travolta still holds his role as the `comeback kid.'  Swordfish is worth seeing but the plot does get a little confusing at times. In the movie, John Travolta plays corrupt CIA agent, Gabriel Shear who needs help from Stanley Jobson, a former computer hacker, played by Hugh Jackman. An associate of Travolta's named Ginger, played by Halle Berry recruits Jobson to hack into the computer mainframe of a bank to relinquish funds that equal up to about $9 billion that the CIA has been holding since the 60's. The bad part about Swordfish, is that there's too much action.  In all the explosions and shooting you forget there's actually suppose to be a plot. Another downside is that John Travolta's whole explanation for all of this is to protect the U.S. citizens from themselves. If you're a big Travolta fan or if you just like Halle Berry I would recommend that you go see the movie. Overall I gave Swordfish a 7 out of 10.",Swordfish
181,hbraun,probably the most stupid action movie I ever saw,3,13 November 2001,"I didn't expect much - some solid action, a more or less interesting plot, some cool scenes, and well, never seen Ms. Berry in a movie before. Left the theatre pretty disappointed. Senseless action, extremely stupid plot, no really cool scenes, and well, Ms. Berry surely is extremely sexy, but not in this movie (in spite of the ridiculous topless seconds).",Swordfish
182,dltdvd,Not too good...,1,27 June 2002,"As soon as we get done watching the opening logos, we immediately hear John Travolta's unintentionally funny dialogue in which he describes why he doesn't understand Hollywood and their films, specifically ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Soon after, he is taking people hostage and we see a ""Matrix""-style Bullet Time effect, which is shown for no other reason other than to ""impress"" us.Personally, I think ""The Matrix"" was an overrated movie. And contrary to popular belief, it had no original ideas; it simply borrowed (Or should I say ripped off of?) some elements from ""Tron,"" ""Total Recall,"" and the slow-motion bullet effects depicted in ""Face/Off."" At least ""Swordfish"" doesn't pretend to have original ideas. In fact, there are some nice action sequences, such as a bus hanging from a helicopter, which was very well choreographed partially by stunt coordinators and by visual effects artists. It's your standard action/popcorn flick, with nothing really special about it. But is that enough to make up for some of the lousy elements of the film? Possibly for some of them.There are some sequences in the film that really do nothing for the plot, such as Hugh Jackman's character being held at gunpoint while he tries to break a computer code. But not only is there a gun to distract him, he's getting a blow job as well. Another scene shows Halle Berry revealing her breasts for no apparent reason other than to ""seduce"" Hugh Jackman. Again, it does nothing for the plot.Aside from the nice action sequences, ""Swordfish"" is almost lifeless, with no characters you could actually care about, and needless sexually suggestive themes that distract you from the overall picture. Director Dominic Sena's previous ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" was the same way. It had an unnecessary sex scene while it could have used a lot more car chases and other action sequences.""Swordfish"" has action sequences that are, as I said, decent, but they remind you of previous films, thus they aren't really that inventive. If you want to see a good movie, I'd suggest using an alternative password to open the door for entertainment. Grade: D+",Swordfish
183,utzutzutz,Piscatorial Pulp Fiction,4,11 June 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***Why do films like this get made in the first place? my female companion and I wondered as the credits rolled. We walked out of the theater suspecting that a boiled slab of sole and a carrot stick would have given us more sustenance than this half-baked action-adventure flick. But an $18.4 million feeding frenzy on opening weekend proves that many Americans flock to the movies to watch cars go crash, guns go pop, glass go smash, and John Travolta go ballistic while sporting a wildly unflattering hairdo and regrettable chin-striping.[contains spoiler]Travolta's Gabriel Shear is not a nice man. A self-styled patriot cut from the same fanatic's cloth as Timothy McVeigh, he believes that the best way to dissuade anti-American terrorism is to scare the s**t out of would-be perpetrators with his ruthless acts. Considered the world's most dangerous spy, Gabriel `exists in a world beyond your world,' acting as a `driven, unflinching, calculating machine.' Sense a little pulp fiction ahead?To `ensure the American way of life,' Gabriel hopes to persuade one of the planet's greatest hackers, Stan Jobson, to program a worm into a government system. To bait the hook, he recruits his comely partner, Ginger (Halle Berry), whose role is basically to keep us from having to watch Travolta kiss Stan on the mouth or lay around with his breasts exposed in various skimpy outfits.But the hacker-savant has his own sordid past, having recently been released from Leavenworth for breaking into FBI cyber-surveillance operations. The now-penniless trailer park Texan is trying to keep his nose clean, though the prospect of $10 million and the chance to spend time with his off-limits daughter, Holly (and Halle), turns his head. Believing that Gabriel is in it for the $9.5 billion payoff, Stan has no clue he's engineering anything more than a high-tech bank heist.As for Gabriel, he's a `patriot,' not a two-bit bank robber. The moolah he targets is part of a DEA laundering scheme, and therefore tainted to begin with, so why not put it to noble use as a slush fund for his terrorism?From this premise, you can probably extrapolate that the film contains many scenes of explosive violence, vehicular mayhem, machine-gun volley, and buses sashaying through the air.I won't launch into my tirade about how violence desensitizes us to our humanity, or rant about the lack of redeeming social value here. If you're going to a film like this, you're clearly not looking for much more than a Hummer giving new meaning to the words `drive-up window.' But despite my biases, I still assert that this overblown fish story doesn't even do what it does all that well. Suspense is minimal, character definition happens solely in the press materials, and the few female roles are both terribly written and sadly acted. Halle Berry has been cast solely for her physical attributes (surprise!), while young Holly is such an ACOA stereotype that her cell-phoned cries for help are hard to watch.The main reason to go see this film is actually Travolta, who brings his usual charisma to a part that is largely one-dimensional, fleshing it out in a way that few could. Besides, there's that PULP FICTION redux hairdo, and his soul patch - something your eyes will be drawn to again and again. Wish I could say the same for the film.",Swordfish

The movie is filled with surprises things happen out of nowhere and then you see the movie then you have a "" Big Oh "" moment.There is one thing 'the hacking scenes' . That was most unrealistic thing I have ever seen. People typing gibberish , for five times it will show 'access denied' after 10 seconds and numerous attempts, it will show 'access granted' . I mean what the hell . With all crazy intense music and people hacking stuffs made me laugh ,for real. But I can understand, on those days people didn't knew about hacking , so they used to give that a pass. Anyone who don't know about computers would give it a pass!

The only thing I missed was seeing pyrotech mayhem from a bigger vantage.Travolta, sporting another giggle hairdo, struts through the movie with enough irony to (hopefully) let us know it's all in fun. Hale Berry is DDG as usual, but should have been allowed to be bad ass! She's too pretty to be playing a character who may be naughty or nice without coming off as bland. The boob shot was over rated. I preferred the shot of her in her skimpies.Now to the, ahem, plot. Travolta hires a super hacker (Jackman) to hack into the DEA and steal Gazillions of dollars. Jackman plays the hacker doing things on the computer that resemble what Hollywood perceives hackerdom to be - virtuoso keyboard strumming! He's on another plane, he uses his third eye! Wow! He gets to prove how fast he is by breaking into the DOD while getting a blow job and having a gun pointed to his head, all in less than 60 seconds.As with all bad big movies this one starts off well and careens off downhill, ending with one of the silliest car chases ever filmed. Travolta has all the hostages and fellow cohorts aboard a bus being chased by half of LAPD. To get away he -get this- has a giant helicopter pick up the bus. The helicopter travels at less than 100 m.p.h., mostly vertically, as visible as the holes in the plot, and proceeds to crash into everything in sight before smashing down on a roof top so John can make his get away. I can see the special effects guys saying: ""Who cares if it doesn't make sense it's never been done before"".Now I know why I rented this movie. At home no-one can hear you scream!",Swordfish

I get the feeling that it was supposed to be satire, but for me it just didn't work.Note to filmmakers: the ""bullet-time"" photography technique used in ""The Matrix"" has, unfortunately, been overused and is now cliché.

Gratefully, it wasn't overdone through the rest of the movie. -two big gunfight scenes -sexy women -Travolta plays an excellent villainCharacter High Points: -nobody is entirely good nor entirely evil in this movie. In fact, every character has a flavorful Shakespearean ""gray-ness"" about them. -Travolta plays an excellent villainStory Low Points: -This story is about 3/4ths heist and about 1/10th computer hacking. Don't see this flick if you want tips on how to plant a backdoor executable. -computer-savvy viewers won't be convinced by the sketchy explanations of logic-bomb and 128-bit encryption hacking. -graphic-interface virus programming is cheesy. -Most people won't appreciate that a Sikorsky Sky Crane can actually lift 12.5 tons.Overall: -good fun for action fans -great villainy by Travolta -nice plot twists and character surprises.",Swordfish

The trailers made Swordfish seem like a modern thriller, but when I watched movie, I felt I was back in the eighties on some Miami beach shack. I'm kinda disappointed that Halle Berry had to participate in such a classless movie; honestly I can't help but not see her in a respectable light anymore.

It has several twists and turns and actually will keep you guessing. I really thought the ending was terrific. The action is amazing and unlike many movies there isn't too much of it to the point where it actually distracts you from the plotline.The movie also asks a key question that many of us will ponder deeply; Is there any acceptable price to pay to ensure the greater good of all mankind, even if at the cost of a few innocents?? I liked the fact that there was a central thesis to this movie. I did not find it a mindless action flick but one with a keen intellect. I thought the movie was very well done and it had its moments of humour and adrenaline pumping action. Go see Swordfish for the plot and not the pretty girls!

True, the movie did have the odd drawback.  Example: it had a rather cliched plot, but it was covered up with some creative pyrotechnics (i.e. bomb vests, a la ""Speed"", but with a claymore twist).  John Travolta does an excellent and believable job as Gabriel Shear, a diabolical genius with a taste for cash (and a really nice car).  Fellow ""X-men""-er Halle Berry plays a classic femme fatale, beautiful and brilliant (her breast-baring scene was not the huge deal that the media made it out to be).  The crowing character was definitely Stanley (Hugh Jackman, also from ""X-men"").  He presents a more modern, buffed, cuter, sexier version of the computer geek of the 90's.

With terms like ""worm"", ""hydra"", ""512 bit encryption"" and ""DS3"" used at random, you can't go wrong. If you take into account the countless times when hacking is portrayed as typing furiously in front of a flat screen filled with ad hoc graphics and perennial connection to any computer in the world, we're talking Oscar material here. From a wider point of view, this flick wallows in the vice of technology aesthetics. Well, I mean what some Hollywood mentally handicapped men understand as technology aesthetics.If you don't enjoy technical crap, you can try it with lame characters and dialog (""I'm not here to suck your d**k"", anyone?). John Travolta's character, aside from dressing like s***, is unbelievable, awfully portrayed and speaks an unintelligible ideology. Halle Berry is there to show us her breasts and nothing else. Hugh Jackman is a hacker (enough said) that seems to be made of wood, except for the ""hack-it-right-now-or-someone-dies"" sequences, in which he spills his guts out in embarrassing overacting. All in all, this is one of the most cringe-inducing movies I've seen in my life. Every cliché is there (why the f**k every loner/loser lives in a caravan?). Every script line is either wannabe-cool or plain stupid.To add some aggravation, the movie opens with a John Travolta's monologue in which he digresses about the unrealistic nature of Hollywood films.

I think an evil being has taken over John Travolta's body and is deliberately trying to wreck his career to the point where even the next Tarantino won't be able to salvage it. I have no idea why said being is doing this, but consider the following evidence:1. Swordfish is a truly horrible movie, pointless, overlong and predictable, with a strange yellowish tint to it which I have not been able to account for. Yet most of the cast managed to do rather well in it - how exactly, I cannot imagine.2. But not Travolta - he's doing the traditional over-the-top performance he seems to have patented on the set of Face/Off. It serves no purpose here, or most anywhere else.3. A quick look at his credits reveals he has not made a decent movie in four years, unless you're into Scientology and believe BE was a misunderstood work of cinematic brilliance/genius. I do not subscribe to this theory. Now, I actually like Travolta, and think he can be a pretty good actor. I liked him in Grease, Saturday Night Fever et al., and in his early post-PF movies. And maybe he should have gotten an Oscar for Pulp Fiction. But something has gone horribly wrong the last few years. So now I want the old Travolta back, the one who had fun and didn't take himself so seriously. The one who made good, or at least enjoyable, films.

The action scenes in this movie are very well done.  The characters are interesting enuff and the acting is actually pretty good, although I have to agree that Travolta relies a bit too much on the character he created in Face/Off.  Hugh Jackmans career is just taking off and if he continues to get decent parts his star will rise.  Halle Berry is here merely to get us semi-aroused every so often.  One of her breast bearing shots is laughable. She looks uncomfortable doing the scene but hey, the bottom line for Halle is that she isnt a very special actress and any lady could have filled her role.  Sad but true.

The movie gets off to an offbeat start, using unconventional camera techniques, and with the main character wryly commenting about how much crap hollywood puts out each year. Right away I got a good feeling about the movie.  One of the things that bothers me when I watch a movie is that you can usually tell what is going to happen 5 minutes ahead of time - they are so formulaic.  However, despite my best efforts of guessing and second guessing, this movie kept surprising me, again and again.  Do not make assumptions when you watch this movie, because it certainly does not follow the hollywood formula.  It is probably one of the most original films in the past 2 or 3 years.  *vague spoilers ahead*  It is also one of only two movies that I can think of where the 'bad guy' doesn't lose in the end.  Of course, is he really the bad guy, or have you just been making assumptions through the entire movie?  There is much more to it than that, and you really need to take a look at this one to see for yourself.

Apparently she was paid an extra $500,000 dollars for this bit of acting. It doesn't save the movie, and makes me question Halle Berry's values all the more. What has happened to John Travolta? I won't bother with the plot, it's as scintilating as the poster. There was a big crowd seeing this film when I went this week, all of them laughed at the wrong things and quite a few walked out.

212,katyggls,Crap film with few redeeming moments.,3,9 May 2005,"I was actually expecting to like this film. I'm a big fan of Hugh Jackman and Travolta in a lesser way. But this film just spends two hours going from bad to worse. First, Halle Berry. It's a shame that a woman with such genuine acting talent allows herself to be exploited in this way. In most of her scenes, she's half-naked, with no point whatsoever.(There's no love/sex scene.)I don't have a problem with nudity if it has a point. They might as well have taken out all her lines and just had her parade across the screen naked now and then. It would have accomplished just as much for her character. The beginning of the movie is actually the end (or the beginning of the end) of the story/plot. In other movies where they do this, there's a reason. A you-have-to-know-the-end-before-we-can-explain-the-beginning reason. With this there's no point, no reason, and absolutely no entertainment value added by starting the movie that way. Travolta's character comes off less ""Criminal Mastermind"" and more ""Self-absorbed guy who likes to hear himself talk"". Hugh Jackman's performance is OK but not great. The scenes with his daughter are sometimes almost great but more often sappy. Don Cheadle is the only actor in this film who gives a consistently good performance. Overall, I got the feeling that this film suffered from really bad/heavy editing. It felt rushed, with unnatural transitions and awkward plot twists. Better luck next time I guess.",Swordfish

It is an unforgivably horrible movie save for the gratuitous sex and nudity, which I actually enjoyed.  I mean, come on, ""see it twice or three times, even""? Who's posting here, David Manning?In short, Halle Berry gives us exactly two reasons to see this movie.  Two soft, supple, nearly perfect reasons.  If you're into breasts, your expenditure for Swordfish tickets will be somewhat justified.  Otherwise, the only thing you will be after seeing this film is ninety minutes closer to death.",Swordfish
214,jack_1981,"Good Action, Good Acting and More plot than say... Tomb Raider",9,8 July 2001,"-Some minor spoilers-I am not usually an action liking guy. I hated 'Tomb Raider', 'The Mummy Returns' and 'Pearl Harbour'. (And that's just this Summer! Well, my countries Winter, but who cares, right?)But, I was pleasantly surprised. Infact, I was really surprised at 'Swordfish' at how it at least acknowledged the need for a plot to sustain a movie, whether it be action, musical or horror. 'Swordfish' also acknowledges that for an action film to be good it needs to be violent. As in shooting. Not kick flipping people so they go ""aaah"" and fall down ala 'Tomb Raider'. 'Tomb Raider' was PG-13 (and PG here) whereas 'Swordfish' is rated R (and MA15+ here) which is a good sign.I thought I'd like this movie, not a lot, but never the less... I assumed that my grade would be maybe C+ - B- but instead I give a higher grade. (lower in the review)Action wise, it was spectacular. The movie - literally - starts off with a bang. And using the Matrix freeze-spin process on a grander scale... and making it look great. The scene in which Stanley (Hugh Jackman) drives while Gabriel (John Travolta) shoots a whole bunch of people is directed with flair, and shows the violence in all it's glory (not that violence in real life is glorious, but you get the idea)Acting wise, it is also up to scratch. After the abissmal 'Battlefield Earth' and the black comedy (which wasn't as bad as the critics said) 'Lucky Numbers' John Travolta finally makes his mark... again. He is terrific and the bad guy with a good guy persona that can change any second. Hugh Jackman shines as the hunky computer hacker. I have been a fan of Hugh since his Australia movie 'Erskinville Kings'. And he is getting respectable work for a guy who only starred in 2 movies before going to America. He holds the tense scenes well and brings the sort-of-comedy scenes a nice touch. And the scene in which he plays golf in nothing a but a towel isn't exactly the worst in the movie, if you know what I mean.Halle Berry is also nice as seductive Ginger who is a ""is she a good guy or a bad guy"" character. She improves on her terrible miscasting in 'X-Men' to again work with Jackman, their chemisty is much better this time round. And the infamous scene where she appears nude. Well, I think all I can say is, at least they didn't use slow, erotic music when this scene happened otherwise it would've been completely stupid. But in the way it was used it worked fine, and the friend I saw it with had nothing to complain about. He was happy.The plot, although a bit implausable, is still good. It at least tries to have a half-decent plot that doesn't sound like it's been done many a time before. (yes, I am staring at 'Tomb Raider' right about now)And the flying bus scene will have to go down as one of the best/silliest/funniest and allround exciting action scenes in recent memory.A-  ---  8.5/10",Swordfish

Well, first, since this was an action film, it has to be an action rating system. It's just plain common sense to have different rating systems for different genres, while all stick to a specific guideline.-Big name actor(s) in main role(s) -Big name director -Big name producer -Developed plot -Multiple large explosions and gun fights -The ""F Word"" used properly in each usage -NudityThose are the seven marks for an action movie, and SWORDFISH met every one of those marks, so it gets the full 10 stars here (my normal is seven, a star for each mark).",Swordfish
216,gezoes,Finally - More realism,8,7 August 2001,"I don't understand why this movie doesn't get a rating of at least 7. It isn't a masterpiece but it deserves more. The start is excellent. What is being said and done in the first 15 minutes, that's what I've been yelling for years. Finally: More realism.Travolta is great as the bad guy. He needed to make up after the horrific Battlefield Earth, WHAT IN EARTH made him make this? It soooo bad, I'm amazed his career didn't crash a second time. I heard this movie was made under influence of Scientology, well...judging from BE we have nothing to fear from them, LOL.Travolta's text in the beginning of Swordfish was music to my ears. Far from the usual like for example Ed Harris chickening out at the end of the Rock: ""Let's just bring the missile back. I don't really want to blow up a stadium full of people"". It completely ruined the movie for me.Swordfish is an exception as some of the people in the movie actually die, where they always would survive in other movies. The police is having a lot of trouble with Gabriel, Travolta's character, without the police being stupidly portrayed. ""Hollywood makes crap, realism, that's what lacks in movies these days. Governments will always give in if you have a lot of hostages and you kill 30 or 40 of them."" Travolta's lines in the beginning. He's winking at some of Al Pacino's movies and has a very GOOD point. You'll have a great time. The rest of the movie is pretty basic in the action genre but the beginning and the end are non-Hollywood. Finally...a very nice action movie which takes a whole other track then the usual good guys vs bad guys and American flagwaving and morale bla-bla...Enjoy!Downers:The main character is in 'the job' for the money to save his daughter from the clutches of his ex-wife. The blackmail that he encounters just isn't convincing at all.Once again there is a Matrix slow-down-time-scene. Boring and not original anymore.",Swordfish
217,Onethought,On the whole a positively entertaining film,7,31 October 2001,A positively entertaining film with John Travolta at the helm.

The film has an interesting tint and interesting camera angles.,Swordfish
218,lumpynose,it amazes me ...,1,5 October 2002,"It really amazes me that people give this movie a high rating.  Or maybe I should say that it really disappoints me.  I'm not sure if I'm more disappointed in the people who liked this movie or the people who made the movie.I suppose if you were a young male adolescent whose hormones have just kicked in and your only forms of entertainment are TV and comic books you'd be entertained.  But you'd be too young for this since there's sex and nudity (oh yeah, and lots of people getting blown away, but that's to be expected in an American action movie).In case you haven't guessed by now, the script is *incredibly* moronic. On the other hand it's just the right vehicle for talents of John Travolta.And what made it really laughable for me is the computer stuff. Unfortunately I'm a computer programmer and systems administrator and Hollywood never can do computer stuff correctly.  I couldn't stop giggling at the screen shots of their ""high tech"" systems; they look just like what Hollywood imagines high tech is and nothing else.Anyhow, don't rent this one unless you're of really low intelligence or like having your intelligence insulted.",Swordfish
219,trendell-1,"I gave it a ""3"", and I was being generous!",3,25 November 2002,"It's easy perhaps to understand why films like this get made. Nominally they're lightweight, action thrillers with a catchy theme. In this outing, the theme is ""hacking"", the ability of some shady genius to get into mainframe computers, anywhere, anytime, and work super-scams that will shift millions of dollars - or in this case almost $10 billion - into the bank account(s) of your choosing. It sounds harmless enough, but it all goes badly wrong in ""Swordfish"", and what comes out the other end is a nasty, stupidly obscene film. I have  difficulty imagining why wealthy big-name stars like John Travolta, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, and Hugh Jackman allow themselves to be involved in this sort of enterprise. Do they really need the money? If the answer is ""yes"", then can someone tell me just how much money such people want or need?This is not to say that the technical production values aren't high. They are. The explosions are impressive, there are cars and bodies, and fragments of bodies, flying through the air. There are fireballs. We have helicopters zooming all over the place. Many people are picturesquely slaughtered. Good technical stuff, indeed. And it was on the basis of the impressive optics that I gave the film a 3, instead of a 1.The film hits a low point shortly after the opening violent scenes. Ginger (Halle Berry) tracks down Stanley-the-hacker (Hugh Jackman) in his dilapidated trailer in Midland, Texas to make him an offer he can't possibly refuse. A great big pile of money so that he can hire a super law firm to help him get custody of his 10-year old daughter (who is ten going on thirty-seven, but Hollywood kids are always special) from his sluttish wife, who now lives with one of Hollywood's porn kings. (Intense moral drama unfolding here.) Ginger immediately impresses Stanley (and all of us) with her sparkling wit and incisive intellect:Stanley: If you'd told me you were coming I would have cleaned the place up.Ginger: I didn't come here to suck your dick, Stanley.Brilliant dialogue for the ages. How did ""Swordfish"" fail to get a nomination for best original screenplay, I wonder? And later, rising to even greater heights of taste and intelligence, the head honcho, Gabriel - no angel, he, as we quickly discover - played by John Travolta, has a gun put to Stanley's head and forces him to hack into a government site in 60 seconds, or his brains will be moved someplace else on the business end of a heavy calibre slug. And to add more wit and tension to the scene - I guess - a blond bimbo busily buries her head in Stanley's lap, and we know for certain that she's not rummaging around for loose change. I guess this must be director Dominic Sena's notion of a climactic scene.And, so on. The plot is wildly improbable and stupid but it at least unfolds rapidly, thus minimising brain damage to the viewer. Probably the best scenes belong to Jackman, an actor of talent and potential range who only needs to develop a degree of taste and judgement in his roles. (But then he did go on to make ""Kate & Leopold"", didn't he?) Travolta, who is also talented, if not as much as he thinks, walks through the film doing a kind of reprise of his Chili Palmer role from ""Get Shorty"" - a vastly superior film - but with an overlay of nastiness here that does him no credit whatever. As for Halle Berry - well, she looks great, just as she did in ""Monster's Ball"", and as in that film, she mostly acts with breasts and crotch. But, as we used to say in the military - ""If you've got em, smoke em!""At film's end, I guess we're supposed to conclude that Gabriel is a mis-directed super-patriot, a true son of J. Edgar Hoover's resident paranoia, and he wants to rid his country of the threat of terrorism, apparently by being the toughest terrorist on the global block: ""If they blow up a church, I'll blow up ten churches! Hell, I can buy a nuclear warhead in Minsk for $40 million; if I buy six I can get a discount."" So, yes, the film appears to be telling us, let's make sure this lunatic anti-hero gets his hands on $10 billion so he can buy all kinds of ordnance and bring the bad guys to heel. Why not? It works for Israel, doesn't it? It doesn't? Darn! And at film's end, after wiping out quite a few innocent people, Gabriel does get his $10 billion, and the voice-over tells us that hitherto untouchable terrorists are now dying like flies in a winter chill. The viewer is left with the impression that, chaos and dead innocents aside, Gabriel is just the kind of guy we need - or American super-patriots think they need - to set the world to rights. Gabe even gets Ginger, the dishy, if essentially vacuous, Halle Berry, to assist him and, one supposes, make his bedsheets hum. Slaughter and sex are, after all, staple companions in this kind of sad nonsense.""Swordfish"" was made before September 11, 2001. One wonders, in the persistent  pall of 9/11, and the mostly unanswered questions that atrocity has raised, if such a film would be made today. One hopes not. But, Hollywood being what it is, and what it too often is not, one suspects that we have many more films like ""Swordfish"" in our collective future. And that's a shame. The world's a complicated place, and it might actually help if movie-makers would divert some of those millions of production dollars to making intelligent films about complicated issues, rather than mindless trash like this.",Swordfish
220,jimvalko,Fun but too over the top,6,22 May 2011,"I categorize Swordfish as a ""comic book"" movie. It's action packed, it's clever, it's unrealistic and it's over the top.Every scene is designed to exceedingly stun, surprise, excite, frighten, or whatever...as if the director didn't want want a second of footage that resembled real life. Even Huge Jackman's ""daughter,"" a young girl kidnapped by the bad guys, was over the top in appearance and attitude. In the end, I didn't care much whether or not he got her back. Yet, despite all this I was entertained by Swordfish. I thought the acting by Travolta, Jackman, and Holly Berry was superb. Hell, to see Holly breasts alone was worth the price of the ticket. I just wish the director would have given up the comic book mentality once in a while and had given us something to genuinely like or care about the characters. I've seen too many movies like this in the last decade -- heavy on suspense, lite on substance. That's not to say that the movie didn't put forth a deeply important message, it did. The problem was the message was buried under so much hype and fluff that it got lost, for me.",Swordfish

I suggest if your gonna call Trovalta a magician, then you should take some time to show his conjuring skills. Cheadle, unfortunately, was wasted in this bad movie.Overall Message We, as the audience, are supposed to think the Trovolta character was cool for fighting terrorists. But that is stupid.

223,stuman-2,"Contains some very interesting, entertaining premises",6,27 January 2007,"Not a great movie but has enough to entertain. That said, there were some decent ideas behind the silly stuff, (unneeded and poorly produced fluff such as:bad explosion scenes, still more of a reach with ideas which would not be practical in furthering the ideas and goals of the primary character, John Travolta. So while the movie really has too many poorly produced, unbelievable, and unnecessary scenes, which seem out of place at times, the primary objective of the main character, is logical. The idea behind not taking any crap from terrorists in order to rid the world of them is on it's own a good idea. Fight a hijacked plane by taking out an airport. Kill American civilians, we will use tactical nukes. This particular theme really does make sense. How to fight the war on terror? According to John Travolta, beat the living daylights out of them, BIG TIME. Recall history for a moment. When the small A bombs used to devastate Nagasaki and Hiroshima in WW 2 produced a surrender immediately, we see today, the very real possibility of the same thing happening. Travolta needs money to fight on the right side. So, he gets it by hacking his way in to the billions he needs. In steps Hugh Jackman, one of, if not, the worlds best Hacker.. The money that Travolta, (the Brain behind the process) wants, is lying dormant from a fund that was simply gathering nothing but a great amount of interest. Enough interest in 15 years to catch Travolta's eye. Jackman is forcibly coerced to hack, even though he has been caught and is followed by the FBI. Jackman doesn't want the job, he does want his daughter who lives with the Mother. We find Jackman as a confused yet brilliant at what he does.best, hack into the most secure institutions. In this case it's the Dept of Defense. Or so it would seem. That really doesn't matter too much, suffice to say Jackman and his genius are needed to get the funds produced in the interest baring account which after after 15 years totals $9 Billion. So the war on terror being fought by Travolta's ideals and his genius at getting the money needed to fight is really worth some thought. To add to that, we are now so worried about our own individual safety when it comes to buying something on the Internet or even giving a credit card to a local merchant. This is another worthwhile premise that is brought to the forefront as well as some other very worthy themes that actually confront us even more today than when this film was done, prey 9/11. Swordfish could have been much better as Halle Berry and most other characters really seem to be there to fill in with the usual sex and violence. Actually, when referring to a headliner like Berry, we might expect more, but it's not to be. Silly looking crash scenes, Buses taken airborne, inexplicable reasons for what Travolta terms, ""misdirection"" just serve to confuse or at best let the viewer think for themselves. Well, whenever a movie like this one is saying ' just what is misdirection and what is real in order to render a better plot, it's OK. However, we are simply left wondering about this person or that incident. These ""misdirection's"" obviously play a key role in how Travolta gets away with what he does, but the confusion, the wherefore, the how, why and when are never introduced. They simply confuse an already disjointed picture. Many times the viewer will most definitely say, "" what is that, or who is that? What are they doing there, Aren't they supposed to be here? It goes on that way. So be it. Presume for a moment that this film took itself seriously. Great attention paid to detail (not available in present state), much more attention paid to computers and hacking, identity theft, divorce and custody, the war on terrorism and how to fight it and more. Swordfish does cover these themes. The subject matter, the themes suggested above, if taken much more seriously and then turned out by some top writing, well, this movie really could have been top notch.

When the mysterious Ginger (Berry) invites him to meet the rich and dangerous playboy Gabriel (Tavolta), he's sucked into an increasingly confusing, cliched and mildly uninteresting world of hi-tech computer hacking and terrorism. By the time it's explained, you'll either be a) too confused to concentrate or b) too bored to care - probably both.First, a comment on the pulling of the film after Sept 11th - given the extremely touchy subject matter (which is uneasily accurate in retrospect, as well as making it the most ill-timed film release in history), taking Swordfish off the screens was a good move. Unfortunately it didn't bury it far enough and, with the inevitable curiosity the controversy has caused, far more people will subject themselves to it.Despite an enormous budget and a cast who try hard with what they're given, Swordfish is simply too flawed to be an enjoyable, or even competent film. The script is an uninspiring, cliche-ridden mess (one scene's dialogue is close enough to The Usual Suspects to give the lawyers a call) and, though Jackman and Berry rise above it on occasion, Travolta seems to be riding on the same 'repetetive bad guy' rollercoaster with worrying relish (no doubt waving to Gary Oldman sat behind him). They're not helped by a narrative that either thinks it's far cleverer than it really is - each 'revelation' is met by a thoroughly unimpressed 'oh' - or thinks the audience are, and so they don't really NEED a narrative in places. The effects, though impressive, waver between Speed and MI:2 in terms of believability/nonsense, and too much towards the latter. Perhaps filmmakers should that in order for these set-pieces to work, the audience must be able to justify the possibility of them in some way.Not so much a Swordfish then a Flounder.",Swordfish

But, in the end, the audience for this movie, is given a happy ending (if you consider happy ending a spoiler, welcome to American cinema :)But again, Sena provides us with enough fun that we look past the summer formula (car chase, amazing special effects, gratuitous (but wonderful) breasts on Halle Berry) and just have fun.Also note that the first major special effect is far worth the $8.50 theater price.  Don't wait to see it on your 17 inch TV via a coaxial cable and 5 year old VCR.",Swordfish
231,steventudor,"I shouldn't have enjoyed this, but I did.",5,25 July 2001,"Swordfish starts by stating that most of what Hollywood puts out is s**t and that they always go with the happy ending, the bad guy never gets away.That summed the film up really.  It was a s**t film and the bad guy gets away (Although the ending also has a nauseating Hollywood happy ending at the same time).It is quite enjoyable, carried by a great performance by Hugh Jackman and a very good one by Berry.  Travolta is a more restrained version of his annoying Face Off and Broken Arrow performances, but lacks a spark somewhere.It's an incredibly stupid film, but it's a laugh and at least it's not Tomb Raider.",Swordfish
232,The_Big_Daddy,Huh?,3,27 July 2002,"This movie was pretty dumb, but the scenes themselves were cool.  As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but having two persistent thoughts : 1) Is it really that difficult to write a good action movie and 2) How did the writer of this movie get all those people (actors, producers, etc) interested in this movie?  The scenes were actually well produced (the special effects and lighting were good) and the lines were reasonably well delivered, considering the fact that the whole storyline was totally bogus and stupid.  I didn't feel any connection towards any of the characters. The ending was also more dragged out than it should've been.  By the end, I just wanted all the characters to die.",Swordfish
233,Sleel,"Stylish, pretentious, fun, silly",6,4 February 2004,"I'm surprised Halle Berry would pick this movie, of all movies, in which to show us her tits. Not that I'm complaining about the actual showing--they are very nice, after all--but what was the point? Was it necessary for character development? Was it a plot point? No. Was it the money? Mmmmaybe. She seemed very uncomfortable with the whole thing, which sort of interfered with my enjoyment of the moment. Not so much that I didn't enjoy it at least a little bit.""Swordfish"" was a sort-of enjoyable movie with delusions of grandeur. It wanted to be deep, it wanted to be unpredictable, it wanted to be political, but really only succeeded in being nice eye-candy that also supplied a few cool quotes. The most interesting thing in the movie was that the relationship between Stanley (Hugh Jackman) and his daughter was fully fleshed out and believable. Gabriel's character (John Travolta) was refreshingly amoral and willing to act on his beliefs, but ultimately you feel like there's more flash than substance to him. That character was the other high point in the movie though.There are a few stunts we haven't seen, a few really cool action shots, an interesting take on the hijacker's getaway, and lots of explosions. It's fun, it looks cool, and it spackles over the holes in the plot.
Like every other movie that deals with computers, the hacking scenes are absurd. Not that I'm such an expert, but hell, a dictionary crack would work just as well as the Swiss Army Knife, open anything anywhere tactical nuke of a program he writes. Didn't the IT guys at work tell you never to use a word or words from the dictionary as a password? It only takes him a day or two to write it too. Admittedly it's supposed to be based on code he's already put months into in the past, but give me a break. Besides, do you know any programmers who bother to write a graphical interface for their tools?Possible (though unlikely) spoilers:While we're on absurdities, what was with the shootout scene when the government goons come after Gabriel? If that was the best they could do, why would Gabriel even bother breaking out the heavy artillery? Maybe winning just involves having bigger guns.I'm sure that putting a gun to someone's head is a great motivator, but it probably wouldn't do much for stimulating thinking processes. The most excellent blowjob from a gorgeous blonde wouldn't help either, though it would test how well you deal with serious distractions while you work.Ultimately, this movie is a fun ride that doesn't take itself too seriously. It even pokes fun at a few other Joel Silver movies and the film industry in general. On the other hand, it doesn't quite deliver on the early promise of the great setup and soliloquy at the beginning of the movie. It's good for what it is, but fails at becoming more than a fairly shallow action movie. Worth watching if you don't mind feeling silly for hoping the plot might be as good as the rhetoric. Or if you want to see Halle Berry's excellent rack.",Swordfish
234,4everard,OK this film is not the best crime film there is but it still is wildly entertaining,9,24 June 2006,"Swordfish is by no means a classic caper that will be remembered after say Die another Day. The only reason Die Another Day is still remembered is because of Bond. Anyway, this is one of John Travolta's most fascinating roles as the despicable Gabrielle, I also like a film when John Travolta's a bad guy. Gabrielle, as we find out in the film, is one complex character for we have no idea if he's the prosecuted or the prosecutor, and as always extremely likable and this is one of Hugh Jackman's best performance compared to other films he has been in, eg Van Helsing. Jackman's scenes with his daughter are generally heart-warming especially with his ex-wife being an utter cow to him. The most memorable scene in the film, and believe me there are many, is one of the most beautiful car chases ever captured on film. Truly this is one of the main car chases of movie history right up there with Bullitt.So if you're in for a slightly dark night of movie entertainment that will thrill and surprise you then I thoroughly recommend this film. A well deserved 9/10",Swordfish
235,ZielinskiMichal321,What a movie!,10,18 July 2016,"Now this is what I call a movie, a proper high octane action movie! The opening sequence sets the scene for the whole movie, with a matrix like 360 degree panoramic slow mo, but not of someone kicking someone else. Oh no! This is a 2 zillion frames per second, or maybe less I don't know, shot of an exploding bomb, one filled with ball bearings which zoom out at you. Turn the volume up because the sound accompliment is awesome, making full use of the dolby 5.1 format, great stuff. Like I said, this sets the scene for the rest of the movie, complete with guns, gals, explosions and all the rest of the essential elements of a great action flick. The plot thickens nicely, the acting of John Travolta is great for the role, and the performance of Halle Berry is what you would expect of an Oscar winner. I bought it the day it came out. I highly recommend you add it to your collection too!",Swordfish
236,fishpoo,Graph of fun: _____/-,7,22 January 2004,"Last night I watched swordfish for the third time. The first two times I thought of it as a good action film and would have easily given it 8/10. Now, a year later, I have seen more films and expect much more from them.
One problem with Swordfish is that that there isn't really enough action in it for an Action film and it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller. The film opens with a bank robbery. We see a beautiful explosion in Bullet Time (it may look great, but it says The Matrix all over it). After that there's a short car chase and a poorly directed scene of people running/falling down a steep hill. Then we see that bank robbery from the beginning again, but this time the full-length thing and that's all the action I can remember.Between the action sequences there is nothing very entertaining. The story starts off quite simple. A man with no money is hired to hack into some Bank. But then things become extremely complicated as we find out that the people who he is working with aren't who they say they are. Then we find out that maybe they are who they say they are and so on. By the end I don't really know or care anymore.Most of the characters were pretty stereotypical. Hugh Jackman plays the same character he did in X-Men, but without the claws. Halle Berry plays the same character she did in Die Another Day, but this time she takes off her top and John Travolta plays the kind of bad guy who can't stop talking. So basically he's the same as he was in Battlefield Earth, but slightly more intelligent. Don Cheadle plays a rather friendly FBI agent and is probably the most interesting character.The Music in the Film is quite interesting. It's not your usual action movie music that you don't even realize is there. It's different because of the choice of instruments that are used and it reminded me of the Computer game Mafia. Which, by the way, is a great game.The color of this film is orange. Every scene set during the day has orange sunlight. It looks nice. But it's too much of a good thing and becomes irritating after a while.Overall, I think this film deserves 6 or 7 out of 10. It gains points for the Bullet Time explosion even though it is unoriginal. But looses points for being too complicated and lacking entertainment between the major action scenes. It is not a must see. But watch it if it's on TV and you've nothing better to do.",Swordfish

In moremodern times proficiency with computers in the movies seems tobe directly proportional to how fast you can type.  I gave it a 3(instead of a 1) due to some cool graphics, but even those aren'tanything to write home about.

Ever since his inspired comeback in 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"", he's received acclaim for his turns in ""Get Shorty"", ""Face/Off"" and ""Primary Colors"". Of course there's also been the significant shadow of the dismal ""Broken Arrow"", ""Michael"" and ""Battlefield Earth"" along with low-key performances in ""Mad City"", ""The Generals Daughter"" and ""White Man's Burden"". All in all, a mixed bag. Cue the big-budget cyber-thriller, ""Swordfish"" where director Dominic Sena (""Kalifornia"", ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"") brings Travolta in alongside ""X-Men"" duo, Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman.Gabriel Shear (Travolta) is a self-appointed anti-terrorist who hires a supreme computer hacker, Stan Jobson (Jackman) to aide the theft of a $9.5bn warchest that the DEA had left in a dormant bank account for 15 years. Jobson only agrees after Shear's sidekick, Ginger (Berry), suggests that it may help him regain custody of his estranged daughter, Holly (Camyrn Grimes), who is in the clutches of her alcoholic mother. In order to do the job, Shear and his gang take over a downtown bank and wire explosives to hostages to ward off the feds, led by Agent Roberts (Cheadle - ""Volcano"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""Mission to Mars"", ""Traffic""). But with so much at stake, it is hard to trust anyone and boundaries move frequently.Even describing this movie does not make it sound particularly enticing, and so it proves to be the case. This is probably the worst piece of big-screen celluloid garbage that I've seen in a long time (you can tell that I haven't seen Travolta's last few pieces of garbage). The only note-worthy scene in the whole movie (aside from the Halle Berry flash of course), is a 360-degree pan of the damage done by an exploding hostage. But hey, even that's been done better before.
The story goes from uninspired, to silly, to ridiculous. The pathetic climax involving a helicopter and a school bus has to be seen to be believed. Performances are fairly average. Jackman and Berry were very entertaining in ""X-Men"", but they look bored and anaemic here. Travolta snarls his way through another bad-guy role to amusing effect and Don Cheadle is probably the best thing on show here as the driven FBI agent. A desperate mess.Rating *",Swordfish

An element or two that looked like 'style' crept in and teased me here and there. But the movie as a whole, and most of it's pieces were pretty poorly done.I think I put about as much effort in to this review as they put in to the movie.  Which is why I took the time to submit it.  Hugh Jackman did some good stuff in this movie, but when you think about the incredible persona he exuded in X-Men, it makes you really respect a great actor's director like Bryan Singer.",Swordfish
243,Dan Ley,Very Disappointing,5,19 June 2001,"Though opening sequence did indeed amaze with the much-discussed 360 degree cameras, the opening of that sequence was mystifying to me.  Why was Travolta's character into movies?  Oh, wait, I know.  His real identity (fake spoiler) was Chili Palmer, the movie-loving tough guy from Get Shorty, a nifty movie after which Travolta might've been wise to begin a sabbatical.Back to Swordfish, whose plot was at least interesting.  Travolta wants to terrorize those who terrorize the US, so he needs a computer hacker to get his organization some money.  Fine.  But the scene in which Halle Barry retrieves hacker Hugh Jackman contains more bad dialogue and cliches per frame than you might think possible.  Of course, when she introduces herself as Ginger, this movie can't resist a groan-inducing Gilligan joke.  From there, the scene gets worse with tough talk and more cliches.  It's as if we switched right into parody mode.From there the film settles down into a decent first two acts. Travolta does play cool as good as anyone, and Don Cheadle, whose career has gone the route from playing NY playground basketball legend Earl Manigot (great performance) to a cowboy porno star in Boogie Nights to its unfortunate present:  playing the cop or sidekick in bigger but lesser movies like this.  Cheadle deserves better than to be cast as the black guy in the white guy movie.  Action movies needn't score high on the reality scale; they need only approach it, and in one and only one does Swordfish - the relationship between Jackman and his daughter.  He'll do anything to get her back from her cartoonishly drawn mother and unseen triple X Dad.  Not realistic was the derivative shootout in a downtown area apparently undiscovered by police.  Far less realistic was Jackman's record-breaking typing speed while locating a government password.  During this scene I remembered how Jackman's name reminds me of that famous Hugh G. guy from my youth.  As for the famous Halle Berry scene, I can't vouch for reality, but they were spectacular.When Act Two ends we are taken back to the conclusion of the opening scene. I won't give away the reason for this scene.  It's clever, the reason, and you might not realize it until afterward.  What's unfortunate is that Swordfish deteriorates into the typical action movie Act 3, rating sky high on the preposterous scale.  And what's with the bus, anyway?  There's symmetry here somewhere - Berry turns down Speed, then ends up in a movie where a bus...no, I won't spoil your schlock shock.  Experience the absurd on your own.I felt Swordfish was trying too hard to be cute while telling the decent base story of a man with a peculiar way of striking back at terrorists. This is a story that European films, without all the budgets and gadgetry for explosives, would do a much better job of making.",Swordfish
244,Stryder-56897,"""You know what the problem with Hollywood is?, they make s**t""",9,15 February 2021,"Swordfish is pretty much everything you would want from a action/hacker movie.The film stars Hugh Jackman as a hacker that has a notorious reputation. One morning while he's shooting golf balls from a far, Halle Berry shows up at his place offering him a invitation to audition for the position of a personal hacker for this kingpin played by John Travolta. At first he declines the offer but is won over by the fact that he can take full custody of his daughter with the money. He goes to the audition and decides to stay a lot longer then he was going to at the promise of even more money. Action then happens along with a awesome hacking scene.Jackman, Berry and Travolta all do good in their respective roles. At this time, Berry and Jackman had just done X-Men, while Travolta had just done Battlefield Earth.I thought Jackman pulled it off as this hacker who will do anything to get his daughter back, he even had the look on point I thought. Travolta was also good as the film's villain though some people would tell you otherwise. The first line of the movie coming from Travolta was quite unexpected, when or if you see it you'd understand. Halle Berry does a good job also as the female lead who's allegiance is unknown. Dominic Sena directed this and this was a year after he made Gone in 60 Seconds and I'd say this is a little bit of a step down from that movie quality wise but not by much really.Action screenwriter Skip Woods wrote this film and the writing is pretty good overall, can't think of anything to complain about writing wise. The action scenes were well done also, my favorite was one involving Travolta using two guns pointing left and right while standing in a moving car.By far my only complaint with this film is that Don Cheadle is in it and that's always a big no no for me when watching a movie. The guy just can't act in my opinion everytime there's a scene with him I keep thinking that the other actors are acting alongside a brick wall.Overall I really enjoyed Swordfish, a fun watch overall.",Swordfish

If you're expecting Howard's End, you're watching the wrong genre of film. In the history of action films, there are probably about only 30 that could be considered classics. Classics meaning great script, great acting, etc. Something else apparently missed is the true meaning of Travolta's speech in the beginning about ""the lack of realism in movies"". What this speech is really saying is that this is an action movie and it should not be taken seriously. The speech is what gives the rest of the film the leeway to be as ridiculous as it is. If Travolta did not talk about ""the realism of movies"", then I could understand if somebody did not like this movie due to the ""lack of realism"". As you can tell, I really LOVE this film. And that's for the movie's ""lack of realism"". That's what makes it fun to watch. What also separates this movie from many action films is the cinematography. This movie has it's own personal style.

I'm not sure what I expected this film to be about, the beginning scenes lead me to believe I was in for another Pulp Fiction (which I found so disturbing I stopped watching after the first 20 minutes). Fortunately, the plot soon got under way and I was dragged from one scene to another without sufficient time to catch my breath, surprisingly, this did not irritate me and I caught myself gasping out loud on more than one occasion.

259,Mike-134,A Whole Lot of Fun!,9,8 June 2001,"I went to see Swordfish today, even though it was critically drubbed. After viewing it, I felt compelled to write a review and offer my two cents. First, the plot.  John Travolta plays a mysterious financier of reluctant computer hacker Hugh Jackman.  Halle Berry plays the femme fatale that lures Jackman to work for Travolta (her character's motives manage to remain unclear to the end of the film).  The reasons for which Travolta recruits Jackman (and has a virtual army of loyal ex-military men) is also left unclear until the end.  Throw in a determined detective (the great Don Cheadle in a small but important role) and a sub-plot involving Jackman's estranged wife and beloved daughter and what ensues is a really exciting and entertaining film.  From the opening sequence I was hooked and just sat back and let the film take me for a ride.  A very good effort that has the good sense not to take itself too seriously and blows away other currently playing action flicks (such as the mediocre ""Pearl Harbor""). The performances are all top notch.  Travolta is totally over the top which really works for this film.  Imagine one part Castor Troy with a good dose of Vincent Vega thrown in and you'll get the idea.  Although Travolta is top-billed, Jackman is the star and he really shines.  Cheadle is great as always which brings me to the incredibly sexy Halle Berry.  She seems to ooze sexuality in a type of role that I have never seen her in before.  Her beauty, charm, and self confidence just blew me away. This is not by any means meant to be a comprehensive film review.  I am also not trying to contradict the critics who panned it calling it ""loud,"" ""brutish,"" and ""obsessive.""  It's probably all of those things which isn't a problem because it is extremely entertaining (perhaps because it's ""loud,"" ""brutish,"" and ""obsessive"").  In any case, it's a great way to spend $10 and 90-minutes.  Give it a look and I think you'll agree.",Swordfish
260,marty-80,"One of the worst movies, ever",1,15 May 2011,"In the first few minutes, this movie throws down a gauntlet to us viewers, when the Travolta character says most Hollywood flicks are sh**, because they lack realism and don't ""push the envelope"". And then the movie continues with a complete lack of respect towards realism, and stays conventional, except for the special effects which may have been decently new back then.Here are some examples.Travolta say the 400 million they want to steal have been resting for fifteen years, just compounding interest, and so, Mr best-hacker-in-the-whole-wide-world, do you know how much that now is? The genius hacker character played by Jackman thinks for a minute but seems unable to estimate 400 mill at, say, 5% compounded. Travolta happily says the sum has swollen to 9.5 billion bucks. No wonder he's happy, I'd be happy too for some magic interest, because when you compound the 400 mill at 5% you get less than 800 mill. Compounded interest is magic, but not *that* magic. Maybe they have Bernie Madoff as their investment adviser?Then there's the Finnish hacker guy. (He and his lawyer speak German to another, but does it matter? Only if you think a ""realistic"" movie should be long on credibility and short on ""huh??"" - moments). Why would he have a second-nation passport in his briefcase? Isn't that a remarkably stupid thing to do if authorities are looking for you all over the world? What you do is, you dress like Joe Shmoe tourist and you do not say you are on business if you want to be invisible.The enter of Halle Berry is more or less borrowed / stolen from John Camp's novel ""The Fools Run"". That book shows how this kind of operation would be conducted: minimal face to face contact, no cash, only wiring of funds through proxy.Halle is later shot after almost getting hung. She is wearing a sheer dress. We are supposed to believe she is wearing a protection vest underneath, because she re-appears later. Or maybe we are supposed to believe that the Jackman character is unable to distinguish between blanks (no blood) and real bullets?And why, after Jackman is forced under penalty of being shot to perform an almost-impossible task in sixty seconds, after he was given a guarantee this first meeting would be a simple business talk, does he continue to work for the evil Travolta? For the money? Because Berry has kissed him? Oh, come on already. You don't trust a guy to pay his bills who has just shown he is a criminal. Time and again, the movie is telling us: these hacker guys are genius idiots.Worst of all is the disgusting ethics of the movie. Hello Hollywood, I do not appreciate the scene where a hostage falls from a high place and his explosive belt then blows him to ketchup. I cannot appreciate the nice visuals. Why not? It's only entertainment, right? Well, I do not find it entertaining, because I also don't like videos of hamsters in microwaves, even when the visuals are colorful or even when they ""push the envelope"".And what's up with the bad guy winning? He murdered about seventy innocents, stole a few billion from the government, probably traumatized a dozen hostages for life, and crippled dozens of cops. But he is doing it for the greater good: he intends to protect America by applying Nazi methods (""destroy a village as retribution for an assassination"") to fighting the Jihad. That's fascist, and stupid too.",Swordfish

I'd read the reviews, they all said it was terrible, but how wrong they were. It angers me how they can all slate such a jaw-droppingly incredible film this is. The script, for one, is fantastic. No dodgy wisecracks, no cliches, just pure unadulterated brilliance. It holds one of the wittiest lines I have seen in a movie:'Sir, this is a call to notify that $10,000,000 has just been transferred to a new account in your name.' 'Oh. Thanks.'The performance is excellent, primarily from (expectedly) the leads (Travolta, Jackman, Berry and Cheadle - Vinnie Jones is particularly effective). The soundtrack is amazing, composed by the legendary Paul Oakenfold; the storyline is expert - exciting, intriguing and suspenseful...I could go on, but let me say this: I came out of the screen literally shaking. The movie took my breath away.This is what I think: why spend millions upon millions of dollars making appalling trash like ahem Pearl Harbor when some of the greatest movie-makers of our time are making superb movies like this?If you have to see one movie this year, let it be this.",Swordfish

You'll have a good time even though the movie feels strange and violent even though its not. See this movie, have a good time, don't expect CITIZEN KANE.",Swordfish
266,jwillis81,"Like a good old-fashioned action movie, but with a good plot.",9,9 June 2001,"Swordfish was one of my anxiously awaited summer flicks.  And after seeing it a couple hours ago, I am not at all disappointed.  It's been awhile since I've seen a truly enjoyable, mature action movie.  With the slew of PG-13 action movies of recent years, it's refreshing to see one that at least acknowledges that many intense situations do involve language, sex, and mixed character reactions - it wasn't just another black and white, good and bad movie where the good guy does only good things and the bad guy has only evil intentions.  The good guy (Jackman) didn't always do the right thing, and the bad guy (Travolta) could hardly be accused of sinister motives.The film starts off with a bang ... literally.  A big-time action sequence to get out attention, then a flashback to show how the climax of the film came to pass.  The out-of-order editing was actually effective and interesting, rather than seeming like yet another failed attempt to mimic Pulp Fiction and those other movies that brought attention to the idea of showing a film out of chronological order.Jackman was great as computer hacker Stanley Jobson, devoted father who just happened to get brought down for computer-related felonies after hacking into and making public an FBI e-mail surveillance operation.  Forbidden to even touch a computer for the rest of his days, he is lured back into the life by Travolta, who offers him $100,000 just to meet him (and take an interesting version of an initiation).  Jackman is quickly becoming Hollywood A-list material, and with his performance in Swordfish, it's easy to see why.  He can keep up with the smooth-talking, fast-moving Travolta as well as show enough emotion to make him seem like a real person and not just a run-of-the-mill action hero.The plot of the film is fantastic.  It's not just a typical heist film, or action plot where the hero has to save the hostages, blowing the hell out of the bad guys in the process.  The plot is complex, interwoven, and has a point.  The plot was crucial to keeping interest during the slow parts of the film.  Starting out with an action sequence carries the danger of losing audience interest if not followed up by more and more action.  Thankfully, the plot manages to retain interest during those points in the film where things aren't exploding and buses aren't flying through metropolitan airspace, suspended from a heavy loading chopper.The best part about this film was the interractions between the characters. Stanley is a smart guy, and Gabriel's smarter.  Just when Stanley (and the audience) thinks they have Gabriel in a tight spot, he'll surprise everyone with some improvised ingenuity.  There are so many films in the action genre that result to dumbing down the smart villains, just so the hero of the story will look good when he comes up with a relatively weak solution to the complex plot.  The villains often slip up or make some kind of fatal faux pas in judgment that allows the hero to triumph.  There's none of that here. The hero and villain are both smart, and both stay that way until the very end.This is a great summer movie.  See it.  See it twice or three times, even. If you're looking for high art or something that really speaks to you and changes the way you see the world, don't see it.  But if you want to see a movie for the sake of entertainment and having a good time, Swordfish is the movie to go to.  If Swordfish is any indication of the rest of this summer's big action blockbusters, we're certainly in good shape this year.",Swordfish
267,etownmike,"Horrible(spoilers,spoilers)",2,7 December 2001,"Ok pretty much the whole point of this movie is to play out a little joke at the end that the bad guy can get away in movies. Only,does anyone really want this guy getting away,hes not just bad,hes terrible,jus blowing up innocent people.Hes absolutely horrible. Then at the end they actually try to justify him by saying hes blowing up terrorists so he really was a good guy,not buying it,just the apalling apalling way he valued human life left me with a sad feeling.",Swordfish
268,soefikos,sadly realistic,7,13 September 2001,"I don't know how I would evaluate this film if I had seen it 24 hours earlier. It just happens that I saw it the day after the terrorist attacks in the USA, and I couldn't help connecting it to that horrible event. Travolta's character wants money in order to fight worldwide terrorism - using terrorist methods. After September 11, every bit of the plot seamed realistic.Apart from that, I think this is a good action movie, more intelligent than most of its kind. My only objection is Hugh Jackman: he is really good in the film, but doesn't look exactly as a computer freak. He's too sexy for that. But then again, why complain?",Swordfish

271,superstar_carnage,"""Everybody loves a happy ending""",7,27 December 2007,"Swordfish is an awesome action-packed movie blockbuster. It's elaborate and brilliantly crafted script provides movie-goers with thrills, high tech dialogue, fantastic opening and closing segments and over-the-top stunts. Particularly enjoyable in the movie is the very first scene with Travolta and his analogy on Hollywood movies. The all-star cast perform their roles well and are believable in every manner.The film is a high-tech thriller but falls nothing short of being an action movie as well, with action-packed scenes and explosive situations. The plot that Travolta and his crew have in mind can be somewhat considered patriotic especially to American fans. With the overall outcome of the film, the knowledge that the audience is presented with of what Travolta and his crew really do earlier in the film leaves the audience to feel that some good has come out of the survival of Travolta's character at the end despite his character being the bad guy of the movie.Overall Swordfish is a high tech, action-packed, mind blowing and entertaining film, that is recommended for all movie-goers and any action/thriller fans.7/10",Swordfish

273,kai_sheffield,"Stupid, stupid, stupid",4,4 December 2004,"-SPOILERS-I kind of liked Swordfish the first time I watched it, but I just saw it again and realized how stupid it is.Hugh Jackman plays a paroled hacker (Stan) who wants custody of his daughter. Now, obviously he has to be portrayed as the 'good guy,' so he explains midway through the movie that he was jailed because he hacked into and destroyed an FBI program that was illegally gathering info about people. But we also have to believe that the courts refused him any access at all to his child and sent her to live with a porn producer instead. OK... but it gets stupider. The way he can supposedly get his daughter back is by getting tons of money to hire a better lawyer, and that's why he works for John Travolta's terrorist organization. What a hero. Of course, he doesn't get any punishment for single-handedly enabling the entire bank robbery, because he did it to get money to hire a good lawyer to overturn a court case that was ruled repeated against him.John Travolta's character, Gabriel, is even stupider. Gabriel runs a radical anti-terrorist terrorist group. He wants to 'protect the American way of life' by retaliating for terrorism with even harsher terrorism, to make 'rogue states' stop harbouring terrorists. Gabriel is willing to kill as many people as it takes to preserve 'the American way of life,' including Americans. But Gabriel doesn't lead the American way of life, he lives in a mansion full of sluts, alcohol, and techno music. This movie came out before 9/11 so it is not clear what Gabriel is even retaliating against. He is the biggest threat to the American way of life. Not to mention that murdering civilians in countries that harbor terrorists will do nothing to change the minds of the dictators who rule those countries. Gabriel has a bone to pick with the government (in this case the FBI) so why doesn't he realize that all the other anti-American terrorism is caused by that same government?The other actors aren't very good: Halle Berry is a bimbo, Don Cheadle is awful and so is Vinnie Jones. The plot twist at the end is poorly explained (why is Halle Berry still alive?) and the action sequences are dull. All in all a poor attempt to rip off Tarantino and Guy Ritchie. John Travolta's description of bad movies at the beginning of the film will ring true by the time you have finished watching it.",Swordfish

This film has achieved what few other films have managed over previous years, it's high-octane, stunning hacker thriller. Not an easy job when all's said and done. Obviously some criticms can be levelled at swordfish, true, Halle Berry's topless scene adds little to the plot and the car chase is a bit unrealistic, but let's be honest, it wouldn't be a particularly good film if the lead characters got killed halfway through (except pulp fiction!), because that would bring something of a halt to the action don't you think? Once again, John Travolta clearly has great fun playing the villain and does a terrific job being dark, charismatic and a generally great character as Gabriel Shear. The film also has some stunning setpieces which include the opening 3-D matrix style explosion, and a final getaway scene that really is terrific! If you can ignore the little niggles that nitpickers have obviously spent hours looking for because they didn't like the film and had no excuse, then you can sit down and enjoy one of the most clever thrillers of recent years.

277,Cunanan,A huge letdown - a bad movie,4,24 June 2001,"What else can I say .. many of the posts on this board seem to support the film. It was bad. The only redeeming thing about it was the acting by Hugh Jackman. I must say I am beginning to become a reluctant fan of his. Travolta sucked as usual and Halle Berry's character was worthless. So, to recap, the car chases, the explosions, the murders, the very unrealistic computer hacking ... all equal a stinkfest of a film. I actually watched it because three people recommended it, raving about how great it was. I am guessing they took some drugs before going to the theatre or were actually talking about this summer's best film, Shrek.

It has two sex scenarios that I think are not only raunchy but unnecessary - bad enough that my young teens will miss an otherwise fun movie because of these trashy throw-ins.    If you like action-thrillers such as Mission Impossible and MI2, see this movie.

I do have to admit one thing, one thing made this movie worth seeing.  That one thing is finally getting to see Halle Berry's bare breasts.  It was a pleasant surprise.

280,Serenis,Hard to believe due to misuse of technical terms,3,22 November 2001,"Often it is not fair to judge a movie by its trailers, but this one proved to be an exception. It starts off pretty good with some nice acting and special effects, but after a while, the usual ""hackers are cool"" image starts to appear. Why is it that no movie can give a believable image of hacking or even computers? If the real image is too boring, stay away from it! I've seen many computer related movies and there are but one or two that I find the slightest bit believable. Perhaps all areas are treated with such ignorance and disrespect in movies, but I'm not knowledgeable enough in the other areas to be the judge. The misuse of technical terms and techno-babble presents itself on numerous occasions throughout the movie.Apart from the above, which makes the story really bad, Swordfish is a decent action movie. Although I could do without the mediocre computer generated explosions. Maybe the movie didn't have a big budget to work with, but in that case, I wouldn't set my mind on doing an action movie.There is something about this movie that is not all bad, though - the acting. The people in this movie didn't do as I think would be natural (the CIA agents for example) but that should be considered part of the plot.I was shocked at the high user rating of this movie, but I guess most people are blissfully ignorant in the computer area.

First of all, for a movie that was supposed to be some sort of action thriller, the stunts were horrible (except for one scene in the first ten minutes) and the rest of the action was unoriginal and lacking the luster of a quality film like The Matrix (which Swordfish is obviously trying to imitate).  Besides the action being weak, the overall plot of the movie just didn't work.  I'm still not sure who Halle Berry's character was supposed to be, but I am sure that I don't care.  Part of the ending is motivated by Jackman's character having feelings for Berry's, but where and how did these feelings develop?  The scene where she's reading a book topless?  I think not.  This is one of those movies that has decent star power and would look good if you popped your head into the theater for a minute or two, but if watched beginning to end it just disappoints.

The movie not only highlighted the grey area of life, but, proclaimed it.-It showed a man down on his luck desperately missing his daughter due to the custody arrangements. He accepts a job to do many illegal things, breaking the law all along the way to his final goal of reuniting with his daughter. He is not a really good person. He breaks the law and will do almost anything to get his daughter back.-It also showed a man who will ""sacrifice anyone's life including his own"" for the greater good. He is willing to do unspeakable things in the pursuit of destroying terrorism. So he is obviously not a good guy yet he is not a bad guy.

I love how the story unfolds in front of you while you really don't know what's going on or why until the very end and it certainly is a wild perpective on what might be going on in the world that we just don't realize...some area 51 type of stuff sorta, and by that I just mean secret stuff that the average individual isn't supposed to know about.  Anyway, my point is that the special effects are awsome, good action, Halle Berry is hot and topless!  That car J.Travolta has in the movie is awsome and the cinemetography is great.  Overall I think people just need to sit back and let themselves be entertained.  I love a good action flick, and this one is an action flick with a little bit more of a trip to it and I appreciated that...sort of like the matrix..it can open your eyes to a world you never thought about before and in doing so, has some hot chicks and awsome special effects to keep your eyes glued to the screen.

It succeeded brilliantly in this. Brilliantly enough to bring about a long tiresome spate of doofus-like imitation everywhere. TV ads were copies of it, people aped the style of dress and presentation ad nauseum, like chimpanzees that had been conditioned by Pavlovthe whole thing was tiresome beyond belief.And then there is Swordfish.Since 486 other souls have already written about Swordfish, I don't feel it necessary to add a synopsis.It starts out at the very beginning, as merely annoying visually, and goes downhill from there. The influence of The Matrix is unpleasantly obvious in the drab color scheme, which goes so far as to turn people green upon occasion (OUCH), and all the twiddly computer jazz we're supposed to be awe-stricken by.Give me a break.I have two names: John Travolta. Don Cheadle.While I would by far prefer to see Travolta cavorting about as Tony Manero (Saturday Night Fever-brilliantly critiqued by user StarWarsDisco) it still must be said that he's always fun to watch. He's larger than life, and in his youth, was a very pretty boy. I respect his ability to work hard at a role, and he consistently gives me what I want. Entertainment.I do not look for depth and profundity in movies (especially those coming out of Hollywood). And I am always pathetically grateful when, unexpectedly, I find it. In the main, I want to be amused and entertained. I want the nepenthe a movie can give me without any harmful side effects. Done, and done, time and time again by Travolta.Don Cheadle is so solid, so good, and so competent, it breaks my heart to see him in this piece of tripe.Also, honorable mention must be given to Rudolph Martin as Axel Torvalds.That having been said, I will remark that Halle Berry's gratuitous semi-nudity, and excessive camped up performance as a manipulative sex goddess was so over the top in terms of bad acting, I was amazed enough by it to be able to stay awake 'til the bitter end.The transparency of her character was so offensively obvious, I guessed what she was about within seconds of her appearance. Only the village idiot would have been tricked into imagining she was one of the ""good guys"".This is a terrible film. There was a 12-minute short at the end, with alternate endings, and standard producer-director enthusiastic drivel thrown in for good measure. They were possibly the least tiresome 12 minutes of the movie.The elected ending was weak and stupid. A little girl, who has been through unimaginable hell, has emerged sane, unscathed, and even able to be strong for Papa, remarking that, ""it's going to be alright..."" Oh yeah? And let's not forget Hugh Jackman, who grimaces, furrows his brows, and occasionally smirks his way through as the desperately devoted papa. Ho boy! A bad acting job if ever there was one.Oh feh. This is an old flick, already forgotten. No need for it to be battered into the ground any further, by one who, incidentally, tends to be the Devil's advocate, and champion of underdogs where heavily panned movies/actors are concerned.",Swordfish
290,Fincher-3,Password Accepted,7,12 June 2001,"I bet that if you read some book adaptation or the script itself of Swordfish, you would probably think it's another predictable action/thriller story.  And you'd be right.  However, it has a special feel to it.  There's something in this canny story that prevents it from going down the drainthe question is, can it be brought up from, what I like to call, its `crap quota'?  Thanks to ever-improving director Dominic Sena and his band of very merry actorsYES it can.Written by Texas-born Skip Woods, a washed out computer hacker named Stanley Jobson (Jackman) gets a rather friendly visit from a mysterious woman, Ginger (Berry), and makes him an offer he actually can't refuse, even though he tries: if he meets this girl's employer and does a job for him, he will get a chance to regain custody of his daughter.  Accepting her offer, not to mention $100,000 on the spot, he meets this employerwho ends up being the ever-so-evil Gabriel Shear (Travolta), a terrorist calling himself a `patriot' who needs to steal over $9 billion in unused government funds from an abandoned operation called `Swordfish'.With a plot this simple, things so do get complicated, and fast.  There are even times when Wood's script loses focus on its importance.  The script has flaws, but it also has some sharp dialogue.  The four main players take this good deed and use it to make notable performances.  Travolta, Jackman, Berry, and Don Cheadle as agent A.D. Roberts, take to this film as a kid would to candy; they bring energy to their characters, and the end result is dynamic.Director Sena first brought attention to such producers as Jerry Bruckheimer (`Armageddon', `Pearl Harbor') and Joel Silver (`Matrix', who also produced here) last year with `Gone in 60 Seconds'.  Though it wasn't a disaster as most critics made it out to be, Sena didn't show true directing chops, but he did show promise.  He's like a high school teen: his `freshman'  try was under the gun, but his `sophomore' try is better, because frankly he's a little wiser.  He's not only interested in creating stylish and elaborate action sequences, but now he's interested in human characteristics and conflict.  He did a great job with Jackman's humanistic struggle to be with his daughter again.  Sena improved here, and I have a feeling he's only going to get better.Before ending this review, there is something I REALLY have to mention.  In the beginning, Sena decided to make this horrific explosion and turn it into a sequence that goes a little like this: During the whole explosion, the camera actually makes a 360 pan through everything: the streets, in between cars, in coffee shops.  After it was all over, all I said was `damn!' and started to applaud.GRADE: B+",Swordfish
291,crumpton23,"Nothing to see here, No spoilers.",4,8 June 2001,"Movies are a function of expectation.  If you go into it for a mindless summer action flick and because you are hoping to see Halle Berry, then you will not be disappointed.  If you hope to see the next great action flick, then you will be sorry.It has one of the most engaging openings to a movie in recent memory, and showed you from the opening monologue that it was not trying to be something it is not.  Then it wandered into the `standard plot and character motivation' and stayed there for too long.  It attempted to introduce a different motivation for the bank robbers than the typical film, but it failed in making this credible or interesting.  The large action sequence in the second act was pointless, but was a welcome change from the lagging plot up to that point.  It finally crashed in the third act (especially with the resolution), but nothing more will be said about that for those of you who have not seen it yet.  Hugh Jackman's star is rising and this movie will serve him well.  Halle Berry must have enjoyed making this one, since it is a departure from her standard movie roles.  John Travolta plays a good villain (Face/Off), but his role reminded me too much of the other John Woo movie he was in (Broken Arrow).  He probably needs another agent to steer him away from his recent movie role decisions.  Don Cheadle played the thankless role of the smart cop in the dumb cop movie.All in all, it was a fun movie that did not break any new ground in the action genre.  It will most likely be swallowed up in the blockbuster summer.  Planet of the Apes and A.I.  will make us forget about this one.6 out of 10",Swordfish
292,Matthias-25,An intriguing beginning and unconventional ending - with not much in-between,4,16 July 2002,"In a rather self-referential opening scene, the film poses an intriguing question: Why must Hollywood movies always end the way they do? Why wouldn't it be a happy ending when the bad guy gets away unharmed for a change?Unfortunately, what follows seems to be an implementation straight from the template ""Action Film Making 101"". The explosions are spectacular, the stunts breathtaking, and the techno-gadgets are impressive. Besides that, there is not much substance. One thing kept my interest, though: There's a hacker involved. As an IT-Professional, I am always interested how computer programs are represented in movies - some artistic license is always required, because the real-life hacker tool, the standard 27 by 80 character terminal window, just doesn't make for good visuals. The solution to this dilemma in 'Swordfish' is not too bad. But working seven screens simultaneously like a rock band drummer - honestly...*** Warning: Spoilers below ***'Swordfish' tries to answer the question that was posed in the opening scene by its own ending. If I got that right, it is OK that the bad guy gets away if a) the good guy gets away also b) the bad, but beautiful gal gets away also c) the bad guy uses his loot to bomb terrorists and nuke the capitals of rogue states. In my eyes a rather questionable morale, but then, I am not American...Speaking of morale: It keeps amazing me that films have no problem showing people shot, stabbed, burnt or converted into walking bombs - but big discussions arise as soon as a pair of female breasts is plainly visible for about ten seconds. Oh well...",Swordfish

The beginning of the film with him talking about ""Hollywood lacking realis"" fit him to a T. Not only was the whole cast outstanding but the action of the movie was remarkable as well. We were brought into a hacker's world...and not only were our eyes entertained but our ears as well from the good dialogue to the music all by Paul Oakenfold. One of my personal favorite scenes whether it be short and simple or not...was when Stanley(Hugh Jackman)was trying to create a worm in front of this computer with some 6 monitors and the song was going along with his every move, every expression...it was enjoyable. Perhaps the ending was a LITTLE over the top...but not by much from the endings I have seen in today's other ""cinematic visions"".

However, John Travolta rose from the depths of Battlefield Earth to act in this excellently written film.  The plot is well written, not settling with the normal ""give us the money or we'll kill the hostage"" storyline. Making use of technology, the film dives into the use of computers, but keeping things realistic as well (no Matrix garble here).  The introduction alone is Oscar-worthy, catching you offguard completely.  Hugh Jackman really expresses his acting ability (aside from the inhuman constant rage in X-Men).  Anyway, it's a brilliant, and well planned story, with a lot of twists and turns along the way.  Some of the physics were a little off (if a car pulls the emergency brake at 70 miles an hour, you can't remain standing without being flung out of the car).  The ending was a little sketchy, but good enough to satisfy.  Other than that, it's a good, and original film.  I hope it holds well at the theaters.",Swordfish

Isn't that why we go to the movies?  The most interesting aspect of this film is the intriguing story line that almost screams for sequals.

Halle Berry comes into the picture as a mysterious femme fatale-type who is in the terrorist gang, which is being tracked by an FBI agent played by Don Cheadle.  Overall, Swordfish is average.  It has great special effects, but great special effects do not a great movie make.  Some of the ways the envelope was pushed in this film turned me off to it, but the story is okay and the ending is pretty good, if understood.  If you see Swordfish this summer, do not expect another Matrix.  You'll just have to wait until Matrix 2 comes out.

The movie looked great, for example: the scene with the flying bus was awesome.The acting wasn't very important in this film and not very interesting either. Travolta keeps showing up in horrible movies lately, Jackman hasn't made a good film as far as I know etc. I don't understand why Don Cheadle participated in this film.

Never is it expected that the bad guys who might be good guys might win but might have not..........try and get your head around it for a minute. I completely agree that it is a movie about whether the ends justifies the means not anything else, and we are cleverly left to decide whether it does or doesn't by the ambiguity of the death/survival of John Travolta's character. The beginning sequence is breath taking action for those adrenaline junkies out there but the plot keeps you intrigued until the end of the movie and right through to the next few days.

The viewer now realises that the script has reneged completely on the promise of its opening speech, and will have to make do with such tired-and-trusted conventions as formulaic dance music accompanying hackers doing stuff we don't understand, just a little bit of gratuitous nudity, ""one last job"" and cheap sentiment between a parent and a child.If you enjoy action and don't demand a sliver of originality, this is fairly okay.",Swordfish

However it's not just his performance which carries this movie; other great cast include hugh jackman, halle berry and don cheadle. There are some fantastic action sequences as well, like the opening scene or the car chase (which is fantastic, by the way, as you would expect from Dominic Sena) To sum it up, a fantastic action/techno thriller; if you liked John's other movies (like broken arrow, face off, pulp fiction) then you will probably really enjoy this.

So most reviews, which unfortunately seem to come from average viewers, make me sick. Swordfish is an unanswerable question which can only be seen to be believed.Pretty good acting, good direction but what makes this movie so big is the storyline, which raises many questions on where and when to draw the line. The line between two conflicting rights, and in the story Gabriel(John Travolta) chooses one over the other and Stanley(Hugh Jackman)chooses the other. Meanwhile, Gabriel and his misdirection leaves you a climax with butterflies in your stomach, just like maybe 'The Sixth Sense' or 'K- Pax'. You want to watch it again but each time the mystery further engrosses you with the unanswered question. and that is Swordfish.All the characters are gray and that makes the movie more real and more imaginable. Gabriel's philosophy to make terrorism such a horror that people flinch at the mere mention of it is one of the rights. The choice to kill one innocent to save many more lives...or kill 10 ,100, 1000 innocents to save the rest of the world is one of the few questions, the movie asks you?Great action... the full circle bullet time effect was good and the director does well in not allowing the movie into running into itself and end up as an average action thriller. But better still was the entire concept of misdirection.... which leaves you with that feeling....Acting wise.... Travolta rules....he hogs the screen in more ways than one... and his personality keeps the film going. Berry is snappy.

312,t_lejon,A pretty standard film with a couple of highlights,2,9 September 2001,"First of all, I don't think that this movie won't be viewed as bad or even nearly bad by most of the people watching it, I've watched a bit too many similar films though, so I probably am a bit bored with this type of fastpaced actionfilled guntoting flicks with a slight touch of hackeresque and dialogue on speed.It's clearly noticeable that there are alot of influences from the biggest films released during the past 5 years, as if following some sort of recipe for creating a salesbreaker. I'm not questioning this, since most people do fall for the main topics: sex, action, rock'n'roll; if that's for you, this film will blow you away. However if you are a bit like me, and have seen it all; this is going to be as a bad déja-vu.The Matrix was sort of a trendbreaker when it came, and since we've seen alot of it's cinematic features in dozens of new releases. Blending a bit of postapocalyptic reality with a pinch of modern society computer fanaticism, and add the basic recipe for a ""good movie"" (see 'main topics'), wham; bam, thankyou ma'm, and you'll have a movie that will sell alot.Swordfish is full of scenes I could place in other movies, for instance; there's a scene where the character of John Travolta is assembling a .50 machinegun, shooting from a driving car at other cars, blowing them to the sky in explosions that just wouldn't ever be there. I've seen the car chase-scenario in so many movies, that I won't even have to mention one, to call it cliché.In another scene we have the somewhat insane, yet apparently somewhat intelligent madman who wants to take over the world, using a facade of american justice. ""Kill ONE american, we bomb one of their cities"", as some sort of counter-terrorism move. Gee' Watson, haven't we seen this before. Know what?, Powercrazy criminals is a drop in the water in modern films. And it gets better, later in the film he justifies his street-craziness with him being a part of some old american lawenforcing agency (blah blah) fighting terrorism. The guy who wrote the script either was bored, or just don't have imagination.I can line up countless series of films that are JUST like this one, that follow the same method of climax, same rapid dialogue with smart remarks, and the same ""newthinking"" way to end the movie. Still, I think that it can be pretty cool for those of you who haven't experienced so great many movies, or just want to see some thin slender women in undies, listen to cool music, and watching highly explosive, yet unrealistic scenes follow eachother like an ocean over a beach.This really proves that Travolta was made large due to the directors Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) and John Woo (Face/Off + Broken Arrow) NOT through his acting skills. To be honest, I haven't found much difference from all the characters he's played in the above listed movies, and he doesn't stray from that pattern in this one.If you haven't got anything better to do, go see this to waste 1,5 hours; if you DO have something better to do... walk the dog, write a poem, watch the neighbor's lawn, it's better, and you'll save braincells.",Swordfish

323,fiftychance,Disappointing & Poorly Researched,3,28 April 2006,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it failed even by my standards.So it's a movie about hacking. Does that mean they should reuse technical terms incorrectly, and romanticize the whole idea of hacking? Did they think this would make it a better movie? The inaccuracies (see ""goofs"") not only stopped me from enjoying it, they drove me to the point where I actually had to fast forward through more than 20 minutes, 5 of which featured John Travolta building a worm in 3d. Come on. I spend an average of an 6 hours a week on the computer, and even I know that's dumb.The clichéd ""I just want my daughter back"" further detracted from my enjoyment. I could have lived with that overused plot device if they only used it as a motivation for Gabriel (Travolta), but they based a whole scene on it. That dropped it half a point by itself.How many hackers look like John Travolta anyway? Frankly, I'm disappointed in many of the actors for acting in this. If it wasn't for the first 10 minutes I would give this a 2. If they have enough money for special effects on that level, and a cast that high-profile, can't they pay someone to make it a bit more realistic?",Swordfish
324,ndhorse,Way to hold out for a tasteful nude scene Halle. Not!!,3,8 June 2001,"Oh please, this movie was terrible.  It opens up with Travolta calling Hollywood movies crap because they aren't realistic, but that is exactly what this movie was:over-the-top crap.  If the director was trying to make some kind of satirical statement, it failed miserably.  I've seen Travolta's character so many times before in other movies(""I'm kill people, but I do it for the good of the country."")  I have lost respect for Halle Berry.  It was made out as a big deal that she had self respect and hasn't done a nude scene in her whole career until now but now was the right time because it was right.  It was the most stupid gratuitous nude scene I have ever seen. It was straight out of a midnight movie on Cinemax.  For those who can't wait, I'll tell you how integral to the plot it was.  Halle is sunbathing on the back porch nude with a magazine covering her chest.  Jackman comes and says ""I need to borrow you car"".  Halle puts the magazine down and says OK. THAT'S IT!!  Way to hold out for a respectful and meaningful nude scene Halle. I give this 3 out of 10 with it gaining one point for the opening special effect shot and one because I only liked Hugh Jackman in it and one because that's how low I have to start.

325,Melissa-31,If you like action . . .,6,5 June 2001,"Swordfish is at least as good as I expected it to be.  The action sequences are imaginative, if occasionally unmotivated, and stylishly staged.   There were some nice, suspenseful moments, particularly the opening sequence.  It would have benefited, though, from a better script.  Snappier dialogue, a less predictable plot and character motivations that made a little more sense would have gone a long way towards making this more than just a mindless two hours in the movie theater.  John Travolta gives a fine performance as the criminal mastermind and Don Cheadle is good, as usual, in an underwritten part.  Hugh Jackman is merely okay as the down on his luck hacker.  Halle Berry is downright bad.  Of course, since the main requirement of her role is a good body, perhaps she didn't feel the need to really go all out on the acting part.  Her celebrated topless scene is completely irrelevant to the story and not even particularly sexy, though it fits right in with the movie's pattern of casual misogyny and objectification of women.  Why is this necessary?  You'd think that the filmmakers might have learned from movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer that women can do more than slip in and out of tight dresses, even in an action movie.",Swordfish

The matrix has set a new standard when it comes to the action genra and i think we are going to see alot more of matrix inspired action scenes.

327,trageley,An adrenaline rush,9,16 June 2001,"This is the best action film I've seen in a long while, probably since Fight Club.  Right from the opening scene, I was drawn in to this movie.  It opens with a terrific police stand off that gets you riled up for the rest of the film.  There's a great dialog about rooting for the bad guy to win in the end of a movie, such as Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon.  If you find yourself rooting for the bad guy in films, this is your kind of flick.
The plot actually has some gumption to it...it's not just there to give the director an excuse to blow things up and have fight sequences (films such as those by John Woo come to mind).  The score is also kick ass...the sound effects come through and encompass you in the action, and there's a pretty rockin' soundtrack to go along with it.  The dialog is decent (though there are some tacky scenes) and kept me engaged.  There's a quote from Henry Rollins - ""Don't mistake kindness for weakness"" - that they stick in one of the tacky scenes.  The acting is good.  I'm not a huge Travolta fan, but I think he does a good job playing the part in this film.
Overall, I found this to be a really invigorating film.  It was 90 minutes of escape that I thoroughly enjoyed.  It may not be for everyone, but if you like action films and stories that involve computer hacking, government plots and robbery schemes, this may be one for you.",Swordfish

You see, until now, it is by far the most exciting, breath - taking film thah has been shown in Greece this Summer ( 2001 ). It seems that John Travolta made the right decision when he trusted in collaborating with Dominic Sena. The film is packed with action and suspense. Fortunately Sena did not trust only in his yellow camera - filters as he had previously done in '' Gone in sixty seconds '', but created great action scenes and adopted quite an interesting way of story - telling. There is also quite a descent script with the main concept being rather unusual compared to other made-in-hollywood-films which deal with terrorism.

The team of Orpheus & Trinity were well developed characters that didn't need nudity and still came off intelligent and sexy with a strong purpose. Berry and Travolta didn't appear to have any character chemistry.If the plot was more developed there would have been more to talk about afterwards instead of guessing,""what the hell went on here.""

She Shears exotic and mysterious partner in crime, she does have some good acting skills and breakthrough screen time with co-star Hugh Jackman.

Unfortunately the film very swiftly plunges downhill soon afterwards. Some of the elements are very derivative of films such as Speed and Lethal Weapon, but in a debased form with none of the verve and panache of the originals.John Travolta turns in a sub-Broken Arrow performance as Gabriel Shear - I assume he is attempting to inject some form of moral ambiguity into his role - a total miscasting.Vinnie Jones is getting less and less mean with every ""hard man"" character he plays.A great hacking film remains the peerless Wargames - a great story with real tension, unlike this drivel foisted on us by the scriptwriters and studio execs. I somehow can't imagine Matthew Broderick being told to crack Joshua's ""Global Thermonuclear War"" program in 60 seconds with a gun at his head and a blonde's face in his lap.I suspect the writers were told to come up with the entire storyline under similarly unfeasible circumstances - suffice to say they did not do as well as Hugh Jackman!",Swordfish

When you combine one of the most charismatic action superstars with two of fastest rising stars in Hollywood and add high-energy, high-octane, explosive action; the result everyone will receive is a movie that will take you on a thrill ride from start to finish.""Swordfish"" contains so many positive moments; I had trouble keeping track of the list I created. Brilliance is the first word that came to mind when I saw Travolta and Berry in their new roles as terrorists, Gabriel Shear and girlfriend Ginger Knowles, because it allowed me to experience variety in their repertoire. Another outstanding highlight in ""Swordfish"" was the story that kept my interest from start to finish. The writing was loaded with class, intelligence and snappy dialogue. When elements such as these are in place, movies like ""Swordfish"" will always turn out to be winners.Rounding out the cast is Hugh Jackman as Stanley Jobson, Don Cheadle as a government agent named Roberts, Vinnie Jones as Shear's henchmen, Sam Shepard as a crooked senator and Shear's employer, Camryn Grimes as Stanley's daughter, Holly.Travolta gave the audience something to smile about in ""Swordfish"" as he returned to film in grand style. His role as the brutal terrorist is his best performance since ""A Civil Action."" Unlike his previous villainous roles ""Battlefield Earth,"" ""Face/Off"" and ""Broken Arrow,"" Travolta exudes a brutal mean streak that takes no prisoners and makes no room for excuses. One of the most enjoyable parts about this character is everything must be black or white. With each passing moment on screen, I was smiling because Travolta performed his role with a confident, arrogant and calm attitude. Travolta is a joy to watch on screen and I relish the opportunity to see him in another villainous role. I can't wait for his next film to come out because I know it is going to be just as good as ""Swordfish.""Berry was a perfect selection a great fit in ""Swordfish"" because she brought life and charm to the film. Berry was one of the pieces to the puzzle, which made ""Swordfish"" a treat. Berry was so incredible in this film, she seemed natural in the role she played; furthermore, little effort was needed to convince me that Berry was exactly who she said she was in the film. The best thing about Berry in this film was the mystery surrounding her true identity and reason why she was in the situation with Travolta and Jackman. I hope she continues shine with each role she takes in the future.Jackman continues to soar as an actor with his role as a computer hacker forced to work for a team of terrorists led by Shear to steal billions of dollars from the government for the good of America. Only time eludes prevents Jackman with the coveted prize called Oscar. The evidence for this statement lies with his impressive role in ""Swordfish,"" which showed his maturity from previous roles in ""Someone Like You."" and ""X-Men.""
With assets such as charm, charisma, character, screen presence and integrity; Jackman provided me with the opportunity to watch a true master in his field of expertise. Jackman has joined a list of actors that include Jim Caviezel and Russell Crowe who have made enormous progress with each role they take. My wish is to see Jackman continuer on the road to super-stardom because he truly deserves every moment of positive press coming his way.Another outstanding highlight in ""Swordfish"" was the story because the writers were able to keep my interest from start to finish. Class, intelligence and snappy were the first thoughts that came to mind when describing the writing in ""Swordfish."" With he dialogue shared between Jackman and Travolta made my day because it is the best exchange I have seen in a long time.With action sequences frozen in mid-air while cameras pan around, sequences that have a bus levitated during a car chase and incredible explosions; ""Swordfish"" will knock viewers off their seat. Furthermore, when you add performances from Travolta, Jackman and Berry as well as the incredible story this movie will dominate for a long time.",Swordfish
346,Neosatan,Starts with a bang...,5,11 April 2002,"...and you understand quite quickly that this movie isn't going to be a deep, emotional film. Its action the way only Hollywood makes. This film has got what you'd expect in an action movie; explosions (a rather funny at the start, to set the pace), car chases, cars blowing up, some gun fighting, a sexy gal, bad guys (especially Mr. Jones) and even a flying bus in the end. The plot: A cracker how hasn't touched a computer in two years is hired by criminals (who again is working for the government?) to break in at the DEA and empty a `forgotten' account. The cracker (played by Hugh Jackman) sees the job as a possibility to get together with his daughter again and agrees. He gangs up with the leader, portrayed by Travolta and his girl played by Berry. Stanley (Jackman) finds himself soon followed by the FBI agent Roberts (Cheadle).> The cast does a rather good job, and that's what pushes Swordfish a little higher up the scale. Both Jackman and Cheadle do a find job and Travolta is his usually slick self. Halle Berry plays the tempting, sexy girl and does a good job (plenty of skin in this movie Halle.). A little disappointing seeing Vinnie Jones talents again being wasted. Jones playing the henchman, a role he plays well, but please, give his characters something more to play on.

In my opinion it is the popcorn movie you secretly hope for every time you buy a movie ticket. I love it when the ""bad guy"" is an intellectual and is given plenty of impressive and entertaining arguments to spit at the protagonist. In this movie Travolta plays an ultra rich and powerful character with plenty of personality and wit. I think it goes without saying that he was the right actor for this role. All the main characters, Jackman, Berry, Cheadle and of course Travolta give brilliant performances. Yet one must also consider the fact that it is very difficult not to come off looking so good, given the script is so impressive and well thought out.

If you gave us some likable characters, then maybe. Otherwise, no. And the plot? It doesn't have to be complicated. A simple neat script with well thought out dialogue and perhaps a twist or two will be enough to change this from being a complete ""suck fest"" to a ""hey i really enjoyed that movie""",Swordfish
351,DragonRyder,Travolta and Halle Berry's fine bod fight a losing battle to make this a worthwhile flick.,3,25 July 2005,"I didn't catch this one when it was out in the cinema but had seen the trailers for it back in the day and had heard good things about it so I checked it out on DVD the other day, but wasn't at all impressed with what I got for my buck.The basic premise for the plot is quite interesting: A very shady guy (played by Travolta) needs the services of a super hacker (Hugh Jackman) in order to gain access to and snatch a whopping amount of Dollars from highly suspect government accounts. It also has a fine cast  John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Vinnie Jones and Don Cheadle, and apparently a sizeable budget to throw at some furious action as well. All the ingredients are here for a fine flick, even a great one, if all the basic ingredients were tied together with a good and well-told story  but this is where it all goes down the drain for me.The basic premise is good, but way it is realised is very disappointing. The characters are all superficial beyond belief. Travolta's character is by far the best  a psycho who is nigh on impossible to get a read on. He is obviously nuts and does a great deal of bad things, but he appears to believe that he is working for the greater good  in his book, two wrongs seem very able to make a right. He has some fun lines and some of the dialogue is even mildly thought provoking. If every aspect of this movie were up to the standards of Travolta's acting and the realisation of the character he is playing this would indeed be an interesting flick, but this is where the fun stops.Hugh Jackman's character, for example, is almost as bad as Travolta's is good. Jackman's acting isn't to blame, but the way we get to view this character, his motivation and personality never really catches on with the viewer. I think we are supposed to root for him and his getting to be with his daughter, but because he is so superficially portrayed, we never really get to feel for him or his relationship with his daughter, and if things are put bluntly, this could just as well have been cut from the story altogether. The movie would have worked just as well, if not better, had Jackman been in it for the money alone and not for his daughter.The additional characters in the story are even more superficially portrayed. We never really get to look inside the head of any of the cop(s) who seem to be our basic good guys or the government suits who seem to be our basic bad guys. Why Cheadle's character or the bad senator even have names must be down to simple convenience of reference, rather than any desire to bring the viewer closer to them as characters. They could just as well remain nameless as they are totally generic and without any depth of character beyond a face and a name. The motivation and behaviour of all the side characters in this movie are pretty much nonexistent.And what if you aren't into characterisation and stuff like that? Is the action alone enough to get a slight kick out of the movie? Personally I don't think so. There really isn't a lot of it, and again, the execution of it isn't above par.To surmise, I was rather disappointed with the movie. If you look for a story-driven plot, you could well be frustrated by the lack of character depth and the way the story is put together and presented, and you are likely to be disappointed by the lack of plausibility that comes in the wake of the misgivings presented above. You will wonder, ""why did that guy do that"", ""why didn't he do that instead"" and ""why didn't we get to see what happened there"" far more often than you will enjoy an occasional fun comment, a good bit of action, or Halle Berry's fine bod.This could easily have been a worthwhile movie, if only the story was better put together and executed. But as it is, the most positive way I can describe it is as a below average action movie with a plot and characters that are totally neglected.3/10",Swordfish

The story is full of unfulfilled ideas such as John Travolta's character being an employee of the US government and his anti-terrorism causes. Also, the fact that there are several Gabriels in the film also does not make sense. If this was to be plausible, all of the ""versions"" of Gabriel would have had to be working on the same cause at the same time in order to take over from his predecessors after they die. The scene where Stanley notices Gabriel dead in the wine cellar is also preceded by one which does not make sense. Gabriel and Stanley are driving in the TVR, and Gabriel already knows that Stanley has seen his corpse and makes a big speech about Houdini. In conclusion, the film comes with a lot of promise, and the cinematography is pretty damn good in it, but it fails miserably on the story side, without which no film can be considered a good film.",Swordfish

The movie tried to make a comeback at the end with a somewhat tolerating finale to the oh-so-tedious plot.  To sum this movie up:  If you want to see some GREAT special effects, come in for the first 10 or 15 minutes, then do yourself a favor and leave.By the way, what's up with the product placements in this movie?  I know Heineken sponsored commercials for this movie, but COME ON! Could they have made it any more obvious?  We know Heineken makes keg cans... but that's not what I go to see a movie for.

There may be some *small* spoiling, but I won't give the ending away: Scale of 1 - 10: Eye Candy: 8 You get to see Halle Barry's boobs There's a ""Matrix""-like scene but on a *much larger* scale.
Believability: 4 Much like *any* movie, if you are familiar with the subject matter (be it F-1 racing, law enforcement etc.) you tend to say stuff like ""there's no way he's typing that fast"" and ""if he's such a great hacker, why is he built? He wouldn't have time to go to the gym"", and ""if he had *that* system and just about anything at his disposal, he would *not* be listening to music on headphones. He'd have a Bose surround sound system"". So here's the arithmetic: (The rock - Sean Connery) * (Hackers / Matrix) = Swordfish",Swordfish

There is no real tension between Jackman and Berry (sexual or otherwise).  They were both tremendously better in X-Men than they were in this movie. I usually enjoy these types of movies, but this one was so unbelievable I started thinking about the naming conventions of the characters and wondering when Representative Gates or Ellison would show up and save the day.  But I have to admit, the biggest drawback to the entire film is the 'parts' that Ms. Berry touted on the awards shows.

Couldn't she have handed over the keys with a string bikini bra on? And what about the BJ in the beginning?  Wasn't a gun to his head enough tension to get him to crack the code within the 60 second limit?  Just asking.Does anyone know where you can rent or purchase the airline versions of these movies?  The chase scene was so unique and such a film feat that I would love to show it to my son.

363,Stephen-129,Surely they can't be serious,4,23 July 2001,"Did I miss something here?  This film starts brilliantly.  An interestingly shot opening sequence features Travolta expressing his views on Hollywood's lack of courage when making films.He takes Dog Day Afternoon as an example of a great film that still didn't push the envelope.  What if Pacino had started killing the hostages he questions, what then?The dialogue is excellent, the camera work engaging, and the acting first class.  This is going to be a superb film, you think.  And it's going to have to be - you start off by criticising Dog Day Afternoon, and you'd better do something special yourself.And then it all goes pear shaped.The film degenerates into one of the most pathetic displays of awful dialogue, sub standard acting, cliche ridden plot elements, off the shelf Hollywood violence, and (semi) nudity that I have ever seen.Now, there are two possible reasons for this:  one, the screenwriter - Skip Woods - ran out of steam after the opening scene, and fell back on the usual McFilm rubbish that we so often see.  Or two, the screenwriter, the director, the cast, the crew and the studio were being ironic.I would love to think that it's the latter, but I fear that I may be giving them too much credit.And so we find ourselves in the land of corrupt Senators trying to cover their own backs, computer hacker geniuses playing golf on the roof of their trailer in what looks like a rubbish tip (!), pointless and frequent images of Halle Berry in little or no clothing (get back here), laughable plot 'twists' that are explained IN ADVANCE for all the stupid people in the audience, good God the list is endless.Oh yeah, did I mention the shadowy netherworld pseudo governmental organisation that is secretly committed to preserving the way of life that we take for granted.Add to that a bunch of Matrix-style effects, and some laughable 'hacking' scenes, and there you have it.I really hope I'm wrong about this.  I really do hope that this is a knowing little stab at Hollywood and all the people who think that this is what film making is about.  And I really hope that they're all chuckling away to themselves about the fact that this has still become a typical summer 'blockbuster', despite all it's irony.But I really don't think that is the case.  Instead, I think that this is just one of the worst films I have ever seen.",Swordfish

The plot is certainly more complex and entertaining than typical action movies (the rock, broken arrow, etc.) Personally, I put this movie in the same group as Killing Zoe, Heat, or Ronin.

But there are too many hickups in this film! In the states it probably won't be noticed but in the airport scene where they arrested the Hacker that Travolta wanted to use first, Axel Thorvalds (any relation to Linus????) he is supposed to be Finnish! So why does he speak GERMAN with his translator/lawyer? He doesn't speak english from the moment they arrested him. But when left alone with his translator/lawyer they have a conversation in GERMAN! I had no problem understanding what they where talking about and I don't speak Finnish very well but do recognise GERMAN. Whats wrong with simply giving a character so unimportant to the plot the GERMAN nationality ???? Then it would be a nice touch really speaking German!Also the great hacker Jackman and the technobabble are way off! Nobody needs a bandwidth of 3 DS3 connections. And typing fast doesn't make a good hacker! And why do we still have to watch a TAPE device every time there is mention of an old Computer ?!? This TAPE device is no computer! it's a TAPE device. OK it's the only thing moving on an old computer. But the CPU in those times had some lights!!! And there still isn't need for a graphical representation to program a good Worm or Trojan Virus.

370,jdhvns,Is good story telling not important anymore?,1,22 June 2001,"I've read several of the reviews listed in here and I am amazed at how many people are receptive to this movie.  Is good storytelling not important anymore?  When should an audience have to fill in all of the holes by conjecture, based on their own opinions, not what the film showed them?   The filmmakers claim to have created complicated characters...who is good and who is bad...but the film was so poorly written that I doubt that the actors even knew what their character's motivations were.  That is except for the Hugh Jackson character, whose motives were so blatantly obvious (getting his daughter back).  If the screenwriter had written one more dialogue scene stating that fact, I would have screamed!!  We know, we know!  He loves her,  he loves her!  He wants her back!!  Just don't say it again, please!!!How do movies like this get made?  Did Joel Silver really read the script and say, ""Wow, what a great piece of writing...we've got to make this!""  And I'm certain that Domenic Sena doesn't have a clue how to tell a good story, or how to recognize good material, or how to make bad material somewhat good.  If he did then he would have seen all of the holes in the script.  My goodness Domenic! Don't you think it would have been interesting to see how the cops got to be seated with  the Travolta character before the explosion? That's called T-E-N-S-I-O-N.  Look it up in the dictionary, it might be useful.   And, not to mention, you put the best thing in the entire movie in the first five minutes (the explosion), thus leaving the transition to the third act weak.  ALL OF THE TENSION WAS GONE FROM THE ROBBERY!!  Couldn't you recognize that?  But then again, you're the type of filmmaker that would turn down a beautiful script like ""All About Eve"" to make ""Gone in Sixty Seconds Part II""...""because there was just so much left out of the first one.""  If I could I would give you my address to send me my $7.50 back. People will decide for themselves if they like it or not.  And everyone has different tastes.  But, I KNOW for certain that this is bad storytelling.  There are so many holes in the plot and characters that they should have called this movie ""Swisscheese"". Even the thing everyone heard about, Halle Berry displaying her breasts, was unmotivated.  You'd think that the filmmakers would have made it intregal to the story (like her using them to seduce someone or something), but no, she just happens to like reading books topless, that's all.   She definitely couldn't have been sunbathing because the entire world of the film existed only at the ""magic hour"".  Why Halle Berry?  Is it worth it to show your breasts for extra money?  If it had a point to the story, sure, but come on!!  I find it amusing to imagine Halle Berry on the set before filming that scene asking, ""Let's see, what's my motivation?"".   That had to be the question on most of actors minds because it couldn't have been written in the script.  And if it was then Dominic Sena is more horrible than I thought for taking it out! And if the actors knew who their characters  were and their motivation, then they had to do what everyone in the audience will have to do--fill in all the holes as wide as the Grand Canyon.   For brilliant movies like ""Memento"" it works.  But I believe there's enough information in that film to draw logical conclusions from. ""Swordfish"" doesn't have that.  It leaves you filling in holes you shouldn't have to, something filmmakers who know how to tell good stories would recognize.  My suggestion if you're going to see this movie--sit down, relax, clear your mind, and when the movie starts, pull out some swiss cheese to snack on, and PONDER...",Swordfish

The characters motives were sketchy at best and the conclusion of the plot was a horribly contrived sequence leaving me feeling taken for the eight dollars I spent on it. The trailers and promotions promised action but all I got was a film trying to build characters that no one cares about sprinkled with action. This movie brought nothing new to the forefront. Hugh Jackman was great and carried this movie. Travolta on the other hand I thought was terrible and just cashing a check.

The music was wonderful for setting the emotional level for whatever the scenes.  Just as you were sure of the plot and the way it would end, BOOM, you'd suddenly be jerked in a different direction.  Although the plot twisted, it kept with the outcome...or did it?  The phrase, ""Not everything ends the way it should..."" comes to mind. I enjoyed the story lines.  John Travolta has, once again, proven that he can perform as one of the most evil, stone faced, bad guys. His so-called logic, would freak you out.  Hugh Jackman was wonderful as, Stanley Jobson.  The concern he showed for his daughter, Holly, was heart wrenching.  You could almost feel the love he felt for her and the pain of not being able to be with her.

376,steven2526,It's a good idea gone terribly wrong.,4,14 June 2001,"While I wouldn't say this movie was bad necessarily, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  It looked like it was going to be the next best effects movie since The Matrix, and from the first scene I really thought it would be. But it unfortunately never got any better from the first scene.  In fact, if you just went in and saw the first scene and then left, you would probably feel more satisfied than if you watched the whole movie.
This is another one of those movies that seem to be the trend lately. They have a lot of action and a lot of ""articulate writing"" which is actually just a bunch of rambling that has no meaning whatsoever.  This movie also has another major flaw which seems to be the trend: blatant and unnecessary ludeness.  All of a sudden for no reason at all we are seeing Hugh Jackman getting a blo**ob.  It doesn't fit the scene, it doesn't add to the scene, and it almost made me walk out of the movie right then.While I'm on the subject of Hugh Jackman, he's one of my favorite actors at the moment, and although he gave his usual top-notch performance, the general lack of good writing didn't give him anything to work with.  If you want to see Hugh Jackman, go see X-Men or Someone Like You and you'll be much happier.  Although I love his acting, no one could have saved this movie.",Swordfish

I did this because I found it ridiculous that other viewers rated it so highly, giving it a seven. This movie, I think, most closely would deserve a three, or four at the most. It had a splendid beginning, starting in medias res is something to be admired in movies if it is done well. Several great stories begin so. The movie from there went on a slow, but steady downhill slide. The plot of the movie was not entirely clear, and the question being asked to the viewers was not related to the movie. I must admit, the idea of the movie was interesting, but they could have done much more with it. Also, the action scene, although it was very cool, was entirely avoidable. Anyone who knows the slightest thing about the internet could have realized this. This, in addition with other major plot loopholes and ""misdirections"" made this movie rather confusing and pointless. See it only if you enjoy action and John Travolta with a goatee.

This movie is a definite must have for any ones action movie collection. You end up in a love/hate emotional roller-coaster ride of feelings towards Travolta. Berry keeps you bouncing from one side to another by playing an extremely liberated woman who can keep her own with any guy. And Jackman? Well, Jackman is Jackman.

The plot is unique enough and borrows very little from other movies, but perhaps it should have. John Travolta has played the role of sociopath 3 times, and he did it better in Broken Arrow. Vinnie Jones is menacing as always, however is under utilised severely and had better lines in Gone in 60 Seconds. Hugh Jackman play's his character with the right amount of fear and confusion. However this may simply because he can't believe he found himself in this film. Halle Berry's only purpose in the film is to provide the 30 seconds of gratuitous nudity.

As this over the top movie races through its seemingly endless scenes of gratuitous violence, overkill and overacting, I could only wonder at the illogical hypocrisy of this argument.
The absurd plotline, surprisingly there is one,  merely provides a mechanism for delivering pointless car chases, gunfights and explosions, even Halle Berry's much publicised topless scene was so shameless gratuitous and unappealling, I couldn't  see what the fuss was about. And as for the hip techno-gadgetry that underlines the movie, I wonder whether the production team had any semblance of an idea of what goes on the hacking world, I mean can you imagine Kevin Mitnick hacking into the FBI mainframe in 60 seconds with a gun at his head and a blonde between his legs?When Travolta reveals the motive for his maniacal tendencies - to hit back hard at terrorists who threaten the good old US of A, I cringed at the prospect of American Neanderthals whooping in support.

I did hope, however, that the movie would be at least semi-entertaining by maintaining enough plausibility to build an action movie off of.  Well, I'm about to save some you from about 90 irretrievably wasted minutes of your life.  Halle Barry bares her breasts and has another gratuitous lingerie scene within the first ½ hour of the film.  Stop it there and do something worthwhile with your time because you have just finished seeing all that is worth seeing in this horrible film.The movie opens in a promising enough fashion, with a lucid critical examination by John Travolta of the problem with all movies - a lack of realism.  He analyzes this problem with great wit and insight, aptly making his point by examining Dog Day Afternoon.  Rather than build from this, the movie merely seeks to prove Travolta's point by rolling out the thinnest, most ridiculous story ever.  Lot's of surface flash and excitement with nothing solid to anchor it whatsoever.  I can't even remember all of the stupid holes in the plot, but here are a few of the more salient ones:The bad guys walk into the FBI interrogation area unchecked and with their guns.  Within the facility, they place a phony call to the interrogating agent on a cell phone to draw him away and kill the witness and everybody falls for it?  I'm sure guys in Armani suits with Eurotrash style dyed-blonde hair are common occurrences outside an interrogation room in a federal building.  If they telegraphed to the rest of the audience that they were bad guys at first sight, why couldn't the good guys get the same sense from them?Halle Barry is changing in an unlocked room with a wire tap on her. Even if by plot design Hugh Jackman's character is intended to find her, why is this supposedly brilliant character not suspicious of an undercover agent who puts herself in this harebrained situation?Why does Hugh Jackman so desperately run from the FBI outside of his ex-wife's house after dropping of his daughter? Because he was legally prevented from seeing her?  Puh-lease.  Hit an FBI agent, wreck some cars and run away.this is sure to take the heat off more than just the reasonable explanation that you wanted to see your own daughter.And to the plot's early premise that hooks Hugh Jackman.why would he be willing to risk his own life and the lives of other innocents to be able to gain custody of his daughter again?  As he even points out at one point, the money will do him little good if he's dead.  And what does he think he will be able to do with $100,000 or even $10 million?  How will the money solve his criminal past and get his daughter back?  Will he be able to buy his way through the justice system now?Stupid action sequence detail of the decade - fly a bus through the heart of downtown L.A. (?) rather than GO AROUND the big buildings.  Of course this would not have been as exciting, but at least it would not have insulted the intelligence of the movie viewing public!!This movie just get's dumber and dumber.  Hugh Jackman valiantly wades through the inane story and direction, and is deservedly becoming a star in his own right (does anyone else see a younger Clint Eastwood in this guy?).The $500,000 that the producers spent to convince Halle Berry to go topless is probably the best $$ spent in cinematic history.",Swordfish
394,echelon-alpha,Painfully bad,1,23 April 2007,"It's ironic that Travolta wastes the first 3 minutes talking about the ""problem with Hollywood"", and then the movie uses the next 2 hours to evidence the problems in detail. Why can't film-makers actually use input from computer and security experts to improve their scripts? How hard would it be to have the computer-related bits make sense?Computer-related inaccuracies aside, the plot was contrived and trite. It was predictable and unrewarding.""Unbelievable, unremarkable sh*t"" indeed.It's only redeeming quality was providing me and my developer-friends with a great new catch-phrase to throw around carelessly: ""It's got 512 bit encryption! You'll never crack the firewall!""",Swordfish
395,Muthustalin,good plot. good movie.,10,14 February 2016,"The plot of the film is fantastic. The film starts off with a bang ... A big-time action sequence to get out attention, then a flashback to show how the climax of the film came to pass.Jackman was great as computer hacker Stanley Jobson, devoted father who just happened to get brought down for computer-related felonies after hacking into and making public an FBI e-mail surveillance operation. Forbidden to even touch a computer for the rest of his days, he is lured back into the life by Travolta, who offers him $100,000 just to meet him (and take an interesting version of an initiation). Jackman is quickly becoming Hollywood A-list material, and with his performance in Swordfish, it's easy to see why. He can keep up with the smooth-talking, fast-moving Travolta as well as show enough emotion to make him seem like a real person and not just a run-of-the-mill action hero.",Swordfish
396,jtl75,A stupid waste of time and money,1,11 January 2002,"An absolutely awful movie. Gross from start to ... well, at least the middle. I can't speak about the finish because it was so boring I didn't get much beyond the one-hour mark. Bad dialogue, bad action sequences, and bad acting. Pointless in the extreme. We're supposed to believe that the best computer hacker in the world lives in a desert shack that doesn't look as if it even has modern plumbing? The super villain is so stealthy that the FBI can't find him but he spends his nights a trendy -- not to mention packed -- nightclub and drives the most attention-grabbing car money can buy? Just a stupid waste of time and money.",Swordfish

I really think that this movies is totally believable and there is never a dull moment. I read peoples comments and i wonder ""what movies have they seen that I haven't?""I have seen some good movies and I have to say me, myself and I think that this is a top-notch movie and further more it has some of the best acting since ""Saving Private Ryan"".I loved the ending, ill admit i didn't totally understand how they got the clone but i still love the way they made Gabriel disappear so easily. this movie really shows some really good points of modern day interests in a very entertaining way!",Swordfish
399,jonelson,Waste of time,2,18 February 2002,"This movie was a horrible mess of twisted plot and hollywood cliches.The 'funniest' scene (not intended to be) was when the 'world's best hacker' sits in front of a keyboard and pounds his fingers up and down at lightening speed.  It's almost as if they speeded up the film, and the result is nothing short of ridiculous.There are so many cliches and ridiculous plot twists-- this is hollywood gone crazy.Don't waste your time.",Swordfish
400,cmagnus,Really enjoyed this movie.,8,10 March 2002,"This movie had a good plot and a lot of good special effects. The actors were really good, especially John Travolta, but also Don Handle. Even though the movie plot is pretty much given away in the beginning it really doesn't change my opinion about it being a great film. As for the hacking part, it really was over the top, knowing quite abit about computers I was amused at how hacking was depicted ;)",Swordfish
401,hobbes_,Every action movie of the 90's in one big cliché,3,22 May 2002,"I went to the movies expecting to kill some time with a decent action flick.
However this movie isn't decent in any way. This is one of the worst movies I have watched in a long time.First of all it's the plot. Is it a plot full of holes or a hole with some plot in it? Who knows? Will we ever know? One of the latest theories is that it's nothing but a multi-million dollar commercial disguised as ""the movie with the most obvious product placement ever"".But at least the movie has hackers. Not your local ""jolt drinking 16 year old pimple faced hacker"" though. Instead we have hackers who all look like models, who have names like ""Axel Torvalds"" and who breaks in to the super secret government computer in 1 minute while receiving fellatio at gunpoint.We also have John Travolta playing the same bad guy he always plays. And let's not forget the endless action scenes that includes cars that explode as they flip over and big slow motion explosions seen in many many movies before.Then there's the Hale Berry nude scene! I guess she felt a nude scene wasn't motivated in her other movies but this time the plot really needed it! Let's just leave it at that.Also remember not to watch this movie with someone who knows anything about computers because he will be laughing all the way through the many ""realistic"" and ""exciting"" hacker scenes.",Swordfish
402,rcarlino689,Clean.,7,4 April 2010,"An amusing and plausible ""popcorn flick"". from start to finish it is safe to say that you should be for the most part, entertained by this film.Travolta plays a convincing and somewhat ruthless ""Villain"", with an attractive and mysterious Halle Berry in tow. I never thought computer hacking could be as exciting as i saw it in this movie, but Hugh pulls it off as a renowned and expert hacker.While i certainly wouldent call this particular filim ""gripping"". It does contain action, drama, and a slight curve ball at the end. with that said ""Swordfish"" is certainly worthy of your time on a quiet night in.",Swordfish
403,mimosa2,So full of... omnipotence,1,3 May 2003,"This movie, among others, is so symptomatic of today's world's fascination with omnipotence. The best hacker in the world, the smartest villain, the biggest sum of money, the most spectacular explosions and son on and son fourth. No wonder America is becoming a big and stupid bully who doesn't know any more the meaning of subtlety, tenderness, generosity, humanism... Nauseating.",Swordfish
404,cbrody,What a load of crap,2,24 October 2003,"Unbelievable, inconsistent storyline, poor acting (except from Hugh Jackman) and an extremely shallow concept overall. Not one but two scenes of Jackman hacking to order, with 60-second countdowns. The provision of two completely incompatible alternate-ending twists (on the DVD release) just shows how bankrupt and immoral such film-making is. An insult to anyone with an IQ of over 50.Berry's breasts are nice though.",Swordfish
405,meleftheriou,"There are steaming turds, and there's Swordfish.",1,4 April 2005,"I rarely feel the need to comment on a movie, but Swordfish deserves it. It is a film for morons. I thought I'd seen it all, but this plunges that Lowest COmmon Denominator into the sub sub sub zone. It you liked this film, I recommend a frontal and rectal lobotomy.And since this site seems to think that even a truly dreadful film warrants ten lines of commentary, as though it were quantity rather than quality that counts, I'll just keep meandering on in the manner of many of the contributors to the Internet Movie Data Base (in full, to fill). Now, has that done it?Michael",Swordfish
406,danjohnson086,Entertaining,7,11 August 2013,Maybe not the best film but certainly entertaining. Hugh Jackman does a great job in a role you wouldn't necessarily imagine him playing yet somehow works. Stanley Jobson (Jackman) is a convicted hacker fresh out of prison who just wants to see his daughter again when he is picked up by Gabriel Shear (Travolta) to help steal an old unused DEA fund of 9.5 billion dollars. With nice sleek action scenes that though not overly frequent are still very well done and a clever script with dialogue that flows Swordfish is a good thriller with a bit more plot than your average summer flick. The acting is good and Halle Berry is well Halle Berry *wink* . Special mention also goes to Vinnie Jones who proves himself time and again as a competent actor in a range of action and gangster films.,Swordfish

408,bugsy-12,absolutely the worst film I've seen in this millennium,1,21 February 2005,"This 'film' is a sad collection of action movie clichés packed with mile wide holes in the 'plot'... enough said.. Although the German-speaking-dark-skinned-Finnish (Tornvalds =D ) was really funny twist..They have money to wreck a pile of Hummers, but don't bother to get any of the facts right..This film reminds me of our Finnish director Renny Harlin's films (Cliffhanger, Die Hard II...), which start as good no-brain entertainment, but in the end they are just violent clichés, huge explosions and one-liner-jokes for the young people. What's with Travolta anyway? I think he could do better roles than this kind of s***.",Swordfish
409,detrituse,Not amazing... But definitely interesting,7,24 April 2005,"Well hey - this film is perhaps taken out of context - as a student of philosophy I can't say I found the logic of this film to be fundamentally flawed - and quite frankly, I wouldn't want to take the advice of an AOL user about whether or not a film has any relevance to real life - films like this are what the big screen is for.. All films have ridiculous action scenes these days.. Apparently its what draws the crowds...!! ""Dog Day Afternoon"" may be a better work technically, but 25 years ago I find it hard to understand the relevance that such a film might have with regards to the world we live in today. Life in the 70s was inconceivably different to how it is now - and regardless of the process of getting to know characters ""personally"" in a film, its fair to say that the impersonal approach that comes across in the film gives a far more realistic 'feel' to the film than, as some people prefer extensive character development providing the ability to empathise with the characters. That's not what this film is about - and to be quite honest - any persons who think they are in a position of authority to comment on the credibility of the high-octane storyline are MOST LIKELY to be mistaken, because (time to put your anoraks on peeps) since I don't believe there are many of us who understand fully the powers of a modern day superstate to manipulate electronic funds, or even how they might come about... Also, I'd be absolutely astounded if said individual also possessed enough knowledge about corruption within so-called law enforcement agencies, the nature of cutting edge computer hacking and up-to-the-minute information about modern cryptography to make a judgement of the intrinsic value of the ideas employed by the film creators. I'd go so far as to recommend this film to watch and form your own opinions on, but in my humble opinion - if this film HADN'T been pulled from theatres at the time as a result of the 9/11 attacks, then it would have been a far greater success. Make of that what you will - but this film doesn't invite anyone to suspend their disbelief anymore than ""The Matrix"" or any other picture that treads on turf of which we have little or no experience.All in all, not the best film in the world - but certainly one which provides an array of interesting ideas to people who may otherwise be in the dark.",Swordfish

411,duplessis-wayne,"Being a stand-up guy didn't work so well last time, so reluctant hero is putting it mildly.",9,5 September 2017,"(Hugh Jackman)Stanley Jobson is living on the fringes of a happy life. He's working a job he hates in order to win back a daughter he loves, from an ex-wife who hates him. (Halle Berry)Ginger is the unexpected visitor who offers Stanley a chance to get his daughter back ... but it may mean losing everything. (John Travolta)Gabriel is the leader of a group that has a job requiring Stanley's specific skill set. (Don Cheadle)Agent J.T. Roberts wants to stop Stanley from exercising his skill. This is an under-appreciated heist film. Gabriel Shear's knowing nods to previous movies may be a bit meta for some tastes, but there is a method to Gabriel's banter. He is knowingly leading Stanley where he wants him to go. In fact, everyone wants something from Stanley. Jackman delivers an energetic and honest portrayal as the father desperate to rebuild his life and win back his daughter. Berry is edgy and sexy. Cheadle delivers another strong performance, but as his character ties Stanley's past and present together it would be better to have him around more often. His few scenes add texture and energy. Travolta as Gabriel is almost the victim of his own talent. Gabriel straddles a fine line between laconic and smarmy. His dialogue is delivered so effortlessly you might imagine his winking at the camera. He isn't. It's a subtle and nuanced performance that probably needed more edge. Travolta's low-key delivery make his explosive moments seem forced, instead of building organically. The movie is suspenseful at times, and fast-paced when it needs to be. There are a few shocks and a lot of sex-appeal. For those who are looking for self-improvement tips with your entertainment, there's even a demonstration of innovative methods of recruiting and data-entry. This is a solid and intelligent adventure. The characters are interesting, complex and painted in shades of good, bad and conflicted.",Swordfish
412,noah-70,Could have been way better.,6,24 February 2017,"Could have been a good movie. But a movie with a crime plot, cyber and law subplots shouldn't get all the details wrong. Errors included citing the wrong constitutional amendments and using the wrong law enforcement agencies. Although the acting was pretty good, the characters actions were counter-intuitive, thus creating distance between the characters and the audience. As a result, the movie quickly grew implausible and therefore tedious. They needed better technical consultants and tighter writing. Perhaps a little research before finalizing the script would have uncovered the errors. We deserve better.",Swordfish
413,kristian-82,Europeans IT specialists deserve more,1,25 February 2006,"Although the special effects and the 'cool people' were OK, the way a Finnish 'hacker' called Torvalds was depicted was horrible. He and his lawyer were supposed to talk Finnish (""yo buddy, I don't see a Finnish flag hanging here, you are in America"". Well guess what. They spoke German. Spoken by more than 80 million people on this planet, and not even closely related to Finnish. And then 'the hacking' scenes. ""I have stored the code on a PDP-10, only hooked on the Internet for nostalgic reasons, nobody would look there"". For crying out loud: a USB-stick in your **** is more effective. But of course it was 2001 then.... People had to stick floppies in their *****. That would have been painful. And the 'code' on the screen. High tech geometric objects that formed a 'mystic puzzle', consisting out of lines of code. And since John and Halle have _no clue_ what they are looking at, just like any other IT-specialist in the world - they can just glare at it. Saying things like 'yeah, you got it'. For which kind of audience where these scenes meant? They most supreme bullshit is the 'login screen hacking'. The uberhacker is put in front of a laptop of somebody else, showing a lodging screen of the FBI. Then he has to log in with the speed of light, because something bad (i.e. guns, bullets, choking) could happen to somebody else. And then - after a lot of keyboard hits and completely unrecognizable 'code' on the screen - the FBI screen comes back with a big flashing 'Access Granted'. Beats me.....",Swordfish

As with most films he's in, Don Cheadle is very watchable but one good performance out of so many average to poor ones doesn't save a film.",Swordfish
