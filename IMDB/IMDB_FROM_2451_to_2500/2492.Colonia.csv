0,Leofwine_draca,Missed opportunity,4,13 April 2018,"THE COLONY is a slow-moving and largely dullish real-life thriller set at the time of Pinochet's coup in Chile in 1973. The one-dimensional and miscast Emma Watson plays an unsympathetic heroine who goes undercover in a bizarre religious cult in order to rescue her kidnapped boyfriend, as played by a wasted Daniel Bruhl. It turns out that Michael Nyqvist, of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO fame, is the weirdo cult leader who Watson must go up against. I appreciate this movie's realism but as a film it really fails to engage the senses, lacking the requisite suspense and depth for something like this to succeed. Watson struggles from the outset and never convinces for a moment, although some of the supporting players work hard. The ending feels oddly lacklustre and I feel that a documentary would have made this subject much more interesting.",Colonia
1,SnoopyStyle,varying tones and a little confused,5,2 August 2016,"In 1973, revolution is in the air in Chile. Lena (Emma Watson) is a flight stewardess. Her boyfriend Daniel (Daniel Brühl) is sympathetic to President Salvador Allende when the military under General Augusto Pinochet stage a coup. The German couple is picked up by the military. Daniel is sent off to be re-educated. Lena tracks him to the religious cult Colonia Dignidad run by Paul Schäfer (Michael Nyqvist) and decides to join. The cult keeps its members especially the women under violent control. They are supported and work for the secret police.It starts with good interest but little nuggets of problems are already laid. It has nice intensity with the political revolution and coup. Lena and Daniel confused me a little. I assumed Lena as a foreigner but I thought she was English. I also assumed Daniel to be a local. The start has a great intensity but it's also a little confused which it doesn't spend the time fixing. Then it goes into the cult which sends the movie into a different space. Finally it goes back into the thriller mode. The different tones and a bit of confusion keeps this from being good.",Colonia
2,Horst_In_Translation,A triumph in relevant storytelling,8,13 April 2016,"""Colonia"" or ""Colonia Dignidad"" is a German English-language movie that premiered last year, but hit cinemas mostly this year, in 2016. It runs for slightly under 2 hours and was written and directed by Florian Gallenberger. Gallenberger won an Oscar in the short film category and has not really been that prolific in the last 15 years since then. And his films always had a foreign impact since then, such as ""John Rabe"" for example. And just like his Oscar-winning effort, this one here has some Spanish parts as well. It is about a young couple in Chile in the Pinochet years. The political background is elaborated on in the first parts of the film, but the heart and soul are really all the scenes taking place directly at Colonia Dignidad. The characters there also play a much bigger role than the supporting characters early on, the friends of the couple.Lets take a look at the actors. Emma Watson is the lead here undoubtedly. It is her story, her love and her suffering. Even if Brühl is missing during the early scenes of Watson's character's presence at Colonia Dignidad, then he is still a co-lead and he is in over 75% of the film too. The two play their characters pretty well. I am sometimes not the biggest Brühl fan, but here he convinced me and Watson proved that she can carry a film like this as well. The two also had pretty great chemistry. The supporting characters were at least as good. Michael Nyqvist (definitely a front runner for Best Supporting Actor at the next German Film Awards) was a perfect choice as the villain here and he played his scary and unlikeable role so-so well. I guess he was the MVP for me. Richenda Carey works nicely as well and is pretty memorable. The other actors and actresses who played smaller parts were good too and the only reason I don't mention them explicitly is because their roles really weren't that major in the whole scheme of things.Gallenberger had exactly two tasks to succeed here. The first would be depict the historical context in a way that keep audiences interested no matter how vast their knowledge about the subject is beforehand. The second task would be create characters and a story within the historical context that makes us care for them. I believe he succeeded brilliantly in both areas. I applaud him for his effort here. I personally knew the very basic facts about Colonia Dignidad and the way this organization was depicted here certainly raised my interest. I am not sure how accurate everything is, for example I doubt he was really gonna be killed the very day after they fled, but it is not a problem at all if there are sequences that were added for dramatic purpose. Still, a very large percentage of the film is accurate.My favorite moment of the film is probably the two holding hands when they see each other again and Brühl's character showing his girlfriend this way that he has not gone insane. They took the risk to be seen and exposed because their feelings for one another were just too strong to deny them. This moment was a thing that so many romance films try to achieve, but most of them come short: a truly beautiful moment of affection and harmony in a world of drama around them. I found it much better than all the scenes with the two being together later on, but it's not as if these were bad at all either. What was the film's weakness? Was there any? I maybe would not have gone with the super-dramatic ending and the chase sequences at the airport. Possibly one plot twist to many to show us the German ambassador as a fraud. i understand that it is reality, but I still would not have minded without that really dramatic ending. I would have preferred the flight being successful and them boarding the airplane together as an ending, even if it less spectacular. The movie had enough brilliant edge-of-seat moments that delivered more than enough thrill for the runtime of slightly under 120 minutes. But this is just a minor criticism. I think this film here is a really brilliant achievement. I was very positively surprise. You really need to see it, especially if you have an interest in 20th century history.",Colonia
3,kosmasp,Interesting and full of emotion,7,12 August 2016,"If you want a tense movie you could do more than worse than picking this one. One that is rooted in real life incidents and happenings of course, but also one that might have heightened a few things that actually happened to make it more ""movie-like"". So this also makes a couple of things more than predictable.If you don't mind this, the movie does have powerful scenes, but also scenes that will shock you to the bone. Even scenes where things are only hinted at (like a certain kind of abuse), but just knowing what happened and what will happen once the camera goes off or the editor cuts, is more than enough to make you squirm. Powerful performances throughout make this an almost must watch",Colonia
4,deloudelouvain,A story that has to be told,9,12 January 2017,Well i guess I learned something new today by watching a movie. I never heard of Colonia Dignidad before and now that I have I wonder how the hell I never heard about that scandalous and disgusting sect before. I started watching Colonia without any expectations and without any clue what it was going to be about. It all started really promising and the further the movie went on the more disturbed I was by it. Not in a bad way though because I really liked this movie. It's just because the movie is based on true facts and that makes you realize how some people are just not worth living on this planet. How you can be so evil and get away with it for years is beyond my comprehension. Now for the acting itself I thought Emma Watson did a really good job. As well as Michael Nyqvist that's playing the ultimate disgusting human being Paul Schäfer. The other actors are all good as well. The story is really captivating and you really hope for a good ending for the entire movie. To me Colonia is one of the better movies I saw lately.,Colonia
5,siderite,"Yes, people actually do that and others fall for that, just like in the movie",8,15 May 2016,"The film attempts to spin a thriller story inside the larger and more important history of Colonia Dignidad, a torture, rape and death place run like a religious cult by a pedophile Nazi ex-nurse preacher in collaboration with both the Chilean and German authorities. It sounds corny, yet it's true. Before and during the brutal military dictatorship of Pinochet in Chile, this guy ran the colony for 33 years, only being accused, then running away, then being caught and convicted... at 84 years old, much too late for anything. His right hand man is still living in Germany, close to his many victims that returned home, because the German constitution forbids deportation of its citizens.The movie depicts the horrors inside in typical American fashion, focusing on what restricts personal liberty and rights, but shying away from actual physical blood violence or nakedness. The scene where Schaefer enters the shower of the young boys and starts undressing for a full second was comically reminiscent of the old movies when people kissed and then there got up from the bed a scene later.Even so, the psychical and emotional torture is shown quite readily, shocking the viewer into asking: how is this even possible? Just look it up: cults sprout all over the place with millions and even billions of people happy to partake in whatever horrible fairy tale psychopaths can imagine, as long as they don't feel responsible.As a movie, though, the film fails in several directions. Many have said that the characters weren't sufficiently developed. The movie was not about the characters, but about the colony, so no, I don't agree. However many dramatic moments seemed crafted specifically for the movie, especially towards the ending. As such, I believe the biggest sin of the film was not deciding from the get go what it wanted to be. We spend the last twenty minutes of this almost two hour movie trying to develop empathy towards the characters that were neglected until then, while the epilogue is the lazy text over saying what happened - or more like not happened - to the people involved.To the question about the reality of the story, the romantic story of the two is fantasy, while the things inside the colony are likely worst than how they have been portrayed. Strangely enough, while the movie made this horror more visible, to actually find well documented articles about it has become more difficult, as many are talking about the film rather than reality.Bottom line: solid acting, horrible reality, kind of bland adaptation. A movie certainly worth seeing, but not a fun one at all. To be recommended at least for making this visible to large audiences.",Colonia
6,Red-Barracuda,Very impressive docudrama about a truly sinister place,8,24 June 2016,"The setting is Chile in 1973. A left wing activist is captured by the forces of the newly elected Augusto Pinochet and sent to a mysterious colony where religious extremism and torture of political opponents are the order of the day. His girlfriend joins the sect in an attempt to find and retrieve him.This very interesting suspenseful docudrama is actually based on true events. Admittedly, the central couple are an invention and are merely a dramatic creation to allow us an easy entry into this real life story. This is forgivable though as in its depiction of the Colognia Dignidad itself the film seems to be playing it pretty straight. If anything, the horrific events have been downplayed, as we latterly learn that the leader of the cult, Paul Schäfer, was ultimately imprisoned for sexually abusing the children under his care; this was something only alluded to in the film, so subtly in actual fact that I completely missed it until the end credits mentioned it. Michael Nyqvist is very good in the role of the highly unsympathetic Schäfer, his is probably the most impressive performance in the film; although Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl are both very compelling in their roles of the main protagonists.I liked the fact that this film cast a spotlight on a part of the world that cinema rarely focuses on. Setting the story around the highly charged early 70's period of political turmoil was also a great backdrop. Admittedly, most of the film takes part in the claustrophobic confines of the very creepy Colognia Dignidad but it is such an interesting and sinister real life place that it absolutely justifies a story fully focused on it. We learn a number of details of the strange daily life of this religious sect, some very disturbing indeed. It could maybe be argued that the film's denouement moves into more standard thriller territory and perhaps this could have been avoided but I thought it was pretty forgivable as this is one of the more intriguing dramatic thrillers of the last few years.",Colonia
7,Hellmant,"Effectively creepy, and quite disturbing.",7,23 August 2016,"'COLONIA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A historical thriller flick; about a notorious cult (in the south of Chile) known as ""Colonia Dignidad"". This film tells the story of a young German woman, in 1973, that joined the ruthless sect, in order to try and rescue her abducted boyfriend. The movie stars Emma Watson, Daniel Bruhl and Michael Nyqvist. It was directed by acclaimed German filmmaker Florian Gallenberger; and it was written by Gallenberger and first time screenwriter Torsten Wenzel. Despite all of the talent involved, the movie received mostly negative reviews from critics; and it's performed very poorly at the Box Office as well. I still really enjoyed it.The story revolves around a young German couple, named Lena (Watson) and Daniel (Bruhl). When Daniel is caught taking pictures of the Chilean military coup, he's kidnapped by the secret police (known as DINA); and sent to ""Colonia Dignidad"". There he's imprisoned, and severely tortured. Lena willingly joins the organization, which claims to be a charitable mission, in order to find her boyfriend and rescue him. She soon finds out that the sect is ran by a very sadistic preacher, named Paul Schafer (Nyqvist), who has never allowed anyone to leave his colony (alive).The movie is effectively creepy, and quite disturbing. The actors aren't given a lot of moments to shine though, and their roles aren't really that well developed. Still the movie is very thrilling, and quite involving. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. It's definitely not a great film (by any means), but it's not a bad one either. I'd say it's definitely worth a watch.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bmrjYaOGPmk",Colonia
8,Reno-Rangan,Some risk taken in romance were unimaginable.,8,14 October 2016,"First of all, I did not know it was a real event based film until the texts from the film's end. But even before that I liked it very much. The film was very edgy, I have not seen such film in a quite long time. It feels like a familiar theme, but that is only the theme, the story was marginally different. Emma Watson was amazing, maybe this her best performance I have seen so far in her career. Daniel Bruhl was not bad either and so other co-stars.The locations, the atmosphere created for narrating the tale, all were amazing, just feels like a very real. The story of a young German couple in the 70s Chile, when the military coup takes place, the supporters of the overthrown president were arrested including these two. Now they are separated and one of them was sent to a secret detention camp. The other one decides to rescue him by risking her own life by joining the same organisation. That's the film to reveal how she plans and all other troubles during her undertaking.Despite what this film reveals, very sad to read the end text. I have been looking for such kind of thriller for some time, so really I'm happy I saw this one. The pace was moderate, but the developments at the right time gives the edge. So from the entertainment perspective to revealing facts, this film well managed. From the director of 'John Rabe', another same intensity film, the majority of those who watch it would definitely like it. The thriller film fans must not miss it.8/10",Colonia
9,zkonedog,True Nature Gives It The Gravitas It Needs To Be Successful,7,27 February 2017,"If one were to judge ""Colonia"" purely on face value, it would be an average film. It jumps around a bit, doesn't have a clear narrative, and doesn't really even have all that much resolution. When you consider that it is based on true events, however, it needs to be judged in that capacity. With that in mind, ""Colonia"" becomes a much more experience considering they had to keep somewhat on track with the real life events.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Lena (Emma Watson) & Daniel (Daniel Bruhl), two young adults who happen to get caught up in General Pinochet's military coup of Chile (both were protesting against that very action). Daniel is sent away to some sort of cultish camp (Colonia Dignidad) which is led by the brutal and enigmatic Paul Schafer (Michael Nyqvist). Lena volunteers for the women's section of the cult/camp, experiencing similar horrors of her own in order to track Daniel down and hope to come up with an escape plan.Probably the biggest ""knock"" I'd have on this film is that parts of it really don't make sense (and really don't even try to). In film-making convention, that is kind of a no-no. You never really understand the motivations behind some of the characters or the things that happen.At the same time, though, that is a large part of why this movie can be quite effective when looked through a different lens...that of reality. One of the characters, a fellow cult member to Lena, utters a quote along the lines of ""don't try to make sense of this place...you never will"". That's what the viewer has to do when watching this movie, too. Instead of dissecting it, this is one of those movies where you just have to sit back and allow yourself to think ""this was actually a real place"". Once you see what happened inside the walls of the cult, that thought alone will make you shudder.It helps, of course, that the acting is mostly spot-on. Watson is perfect, as usual (it's too bad she is taking a bit of a sabbatical these days, as her work is always stellar), and Schafer's character is legitimately creepy. Plus, there is just an air of weirdness and mystery surrounding the entire project that gives it a great sense of foreboding and tension.Overall, I enjoyed watching ""Colonia"" as much for its uniqueness and ""true story"" nature (especially one I had never heard of before) as anything else. Like I said, if you critique it on ""script cohesiveness"" alone it might come up lacking, but once you let the gravitas of its real-life events sink in I think it will move you to care about the characters and their situations.",Colonia
10,eddie_baggins,A watchable TV-like thriller,6,30 November 2016,"Colonia (also known as The Colony is some territories) is a film that on paper has it all, a director with runs on the board behind camera, recognisable faces in front of the camera and a true story as its basis that would suggest a high stakes thriller that has the broad appeal of popcorn eaters and renowned critics alike so that Colonia failed so dismally upon its scattered release over the last 12 months (making roughly $61 pounds in its UK cinema release) is disappointing to say the least.When speaking of disappointment its sadly a word that's apt for the film itself even though its far more engaging that its near non-existent support upon release suggests.While never making the most of its full-fledged story of the Colonia Dignidad that existed in the country of Chile for over 40 years thanks to the grizzly work of cult like leader Paul Schäfer (here played by a long haired Michael Nyqvist, doing a fairly creepy take on the character) who operated the facility as a diabolical prison like environment made for no escaping and a life of potato peeling, corn harvesting and public beatings, John Rabe director Florian Gallenberger still instils the film with enough atmosphere and soul that it will at times thoroughly engage.Colonia does however continue on the rather disappointing career trend of Oscar winner Gallenberger who has failed to ever get close to the cinematic work he produced with his foreign language films like Shadows of Time and while Colonia isn't terrible, the director certainly faces an uphill battle to ever get back to the standard he set in the early 2000's.The same could be said of Colonia's stars Emma Watson (who needs next year's Beauty and the Beast to be a big hit) and Daniel Brühl who seem to have found themselves in a career funk of late after early successes at their beginnings and while mostly fine by themselves in this tale, whenever the two get together an uneasy chemistry forms and much of the danger and dramatics of this rather scary story get lost in amongst their badly formed double up.Failing to distinguish itself from a TV movie like vibe, Colonia may not have deserved its quick death and critical drubbing upon release but the story of this eerily scary and freighting true story could've been so much more, even if its moments of quality make it a watchable and often thoroughly enjoyable thriller.3 potatoes out of 5",Colonia
11,leonblackwood,Intriguing storyline! 5/10,5,27 October 2016,"Review: I found it quite amazing that this movie was based on true events, because the controlling leader of the colony, Paul Schafer (Michael Nyqvist) really had some warped rules, which went way over the top. The photos of the real Chilean colony were touching and the fact that Lena (Emma Watson) and Daniel (Daniel Bruhl), went through so much to escape from the horrendous conditions, made the movie quite intense towards the end. Lena's love for her boyfriend was truly emotional, and I couldn't believe that no one was willing to help her to find Daniel, who went through unimaginable torture, just because he was protesting and taking photos. Personally, I wouldn't have picked Emma Watson to play Lena, because she lacked emotion and I didn't really feel the intensity of her character but Daniel Bruhl played his Daniel extremely well. Michael Nyqvist and Richenda Carey, who played Gisela, we're pretty scary throughout the movie, so I have to commend them for there performance but there wasn't much depth to the characters because the storyline jumps from a happy couple in bed, to a couple split apart, living in a cult. Anyway, I found the story intriguing and I couldn't help rooting for the couple who were in the wrong place at the wrong time but it needed more emotion. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by, German born, Florian Gallenberger, who also brought you Shadows of Time and City of War: The Story of John Rabe. I think a story like this, needed a big director because it's definitely a moment in history which a lot of people haven't heard about. I can just imagine the horrible things that must have happened within the colony, so there must be more to the true story, which wasn't brought to the big screen. With that aside, I still found this movie interesting and emotional but, for some unknown reason, it felt like there was something missing.Budget: $14million Worldwide Gross: $2.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/romance/thrillers, starring Emma Watson, Daniel Bruhl, Michael Nyqvist, Richenda Carey, Vicky Krieps, Jeanne Werner and Julian Ovenden. 5/10",Colonia
12,kluseba,Let the truth be known,9,16 March 2020,"Colonia Dignidad was the German equivalent to Jonestown. It was an isolated cult led by a megalomaniac pedophile fugitive who collaborated with Chilean dictator Pinochet for decades. Neither German ambassador officials nor members of the Pinochet regime were ever hold accountable for the abominable crimes against humanity such as imprisonment, torture and murder that happened there for several decades. The worst thing is that there still is a colony called Villa Baviera that has taken Colonia Dignidad's place. That whole area has become some sort of sinister tourist attraction and people claim that hotel staff is friendly and the restaurant offers great meals. It's outrageous that this place even exists under any other form than a memorial. People who have lost their relatives should be able to grieve here like people who visit concentration camps. Even tearing this whole place down like it happened to Jonestown would still be a better option than what this place has become now. The existence of this place alone until this date is a slap in the face for victims and survivors alike. Germany and Chile should cooperate to shut this place down as soon as possible, start a thorough investigation of the gloomy past and create a humble memorial that educates present and future generations about the horrors that happened there.Colonia mixes gloomy historical events with more uplifting fictitious ones. This movie offers more than just entertainment as it informs people around the world about the terrible truth behind the gloomy cult. This movie should be taught, shown and discussed in history and ethics classes, particularly in Germany and Chile. Aside its educational value, the movie convinces with the realistic settings that bring the seventies in Chile back to life. The camera work is precise and intense. The acting performances by a diversified Daniel Brühl, a resilient Emma Watson and a scarily charismatic Michael Nyqvist are outstanding.This film deserves more attention than it has gotten so far. This is obviously also the case for the numerous victims of Colonia Dignidad. This movie exemplifies the physical and psychological horrors numerous victims of so many others isolated sects around the world have gone through, still go through and will sadly continue to grow through. Education is a strong tool to make sure this world becomes a better place as we learn from the mistakes of the past. It's our civil duty to speak up against such abominable crimes without any shame. Watch this film, spread the story behind it and recommend it to your friends to honour the victims of this terrible place.",Colonia
13,TdSmth5,Should have been more exciting,6,23 January 2017,"A Lufthansa stewardess arrives in Chile in the 70s. During street protests she sees her boyfriend on a platform next to some youth leader. She gets together with him. He makes posters for the leftist youngsters.When the military coup removes the socialist president, the boyfriend named Daniel, for some reason decides to go to the street with the girl, Lena, instead of staying home. There is unrest on the streets, the military/policy are rounding up people. Daniel decides to take pics and gets himself and Lena arrested. Everyone is taken to a stadium where a masked snitch starts picking out trouble-makers. Daniel gets picked out and is quickly put in an ambulance and driven away.Lena is eventually freed and finds out that Daniel was taken to Colonia Dignidad, some religious German community out in the country. So Lena decides to join them to rescue Daniel, who is indeed at the Colonia and is being tortured by the military to reveal his friends. He doesn't fold but instead pretends to be mentally challenged, so he gets a job on the Colonia assisting some metal worker at his shop.The Colonia is run by religious nut and homosexual pedophile Paul. He doesn't think much of women and claims to be able to smell their impure thoughts, actions, and lies. And he's actually pretty good at it.Lena life now is doing god's work--farming during days and peeling potatoes at night. Men and women are kept strictly separated. For months she doesn't see Daniel but eventually she does and they get together. Daniel has discovered a system of tunnels and underground rooms where the military interrogate and torture detainees. Their plan now is to escape not just the Colonia but Chile as well. But as it turns out, Paul is well-connected and his tentacles of power reach very high.What makes Colonia more interesting is that is based on reality. Of course to what extend the portrayal is realistic who knows. Unfortunately the dull, boring, and tedious life on the Colonia is all too realistically shown at length. For a good chunk of this movie nothing remotely interesting goes on. For the sake of realism the movie stays away from too much caricature. Paul could have been presented as some clownish nutcase, but he's not. In fact he's mostly absent in the movie as Lena has to deal with the somewhat cartoonish Gisela who's in charge of running the girls' quarters. The final act is very exciting though as our heroes are racing against the clock.",Colonia
14,robertemerald,A profoundly disturbing true horror movie based on historical fact.,10,13 September 2017,"Make no bones about it, this is an edge of your seat horror movie. It is also highly original. I can't think of another movie that comes close to comparing with it. That such originality is based on fact is highly disturbing on its own. I've seen movies that deal with similar subject matter but this is in a class above. If you really want to enjoy it, or offer the experience to others to enjoy, then go into it as blind as possible. I only grabbed it because I think Emma Watson is a fine actress and I like good political/historical thrillers. I got that from the DVD cover, which was the first I'd heard of it, and bought it. Within ten minutes of putting it on I was literally glued. I had to take a break half way through as the tension was unbearable. It twists and turns, surprises often, sets your teeth on edge, hits your emotions and scares the hell out of you at the same time for a solid eighty minutes. The heroes are so real and brave and understated. The villains are so horrible. This is classic movie making and will probably remain at the cutting edge of its genre long after we're all gone.",Colonia
15,denis888,A Very Unsteady Effort On Chile During Pinochet's Revolt,5,15 October 2016,"Well, the setting seems to be very exciting - 1973, Chile, Pinochet's mutiny, and the whole thing about arrests, The Stadium, and all. The actors - very stellar cast of Emma Watson as Lena, girlfriend of Daniel, who has to join the cult Colonia Dignidad to rescue him. Daniel Brühl as Daniel, a German citizen kidnapped by General Augusto Pinochet's secret police DINA. Michael Nyqvist as Paul Schäfer, the leader of Colonia Dignidad. - among others The pace is OK at the beginning, but the more the film develops, the more unsteady it gets. The sheer bleak realism of Chile gives way to some even thriller or Sire-In-Distress story. It gets worse and worse every minute. Emma is good as an actress and she proves she is more than a sweet face and sexy legs, yeah, but she alone cannot save the mediocre production from slow and painful sinking. The outcome - this film can be watched but once and yes, that's what it is",Colonia
16,tomsview,The truth will set you free,7,29 November 2016,"When I saw the trailer for ""Colonia"" it looked like an absorbing film not just for the unusual subject, but because it had Emma Watson in what seemed like a fascinating role.However, before I saw it, I was aware of the negative publicity including reports that it made less than $100 when it opened in England. Now that I have seen it, my enthusiasm has tempered a little, but I still think it has a lot going for it.In 1973, German Lufthansa stewardess Lena (Emma Watson) joins Colonia Dignidad, a secret commune in Chile, to rescue her activist boyfriend Daniel (Daniel Brühl) who has been imprisoned and tortured by the secret police. The commune is run by German Paul Schäfer in a brutal fashion, and as Lena discovers, no one ever leaves.The commune is reminiscent of those places the Nazis set up to breed the Aryan Super Race before WW2 – overlaid with a liberal dash of the Branch Davidians.The German thing is pretty strong: Lena and her boyfriend are German and the commune is run by a German with plenty of ex-pat countrymen mixed in with Chileans. The fact that the film was made by Germans with some of it shot in Germany no doubt adds to the effect as does the braided hair and Oktoberfest vests. A bit of a problem though with some of the Germans speaking perfect English while others have accents that would have done Erich von Stroheim proud.Emma Watson is an engaging screen presence, and gives a powerful performance, but she gets a run for her money from Michael Nyqvist as Paul Schäfer, the scary, face-slapping leader of the colony who quotes John 8:32 ""the truth will set you free"" as he delivers yet another stinging backhander.Although Emma was at least 24 when she made the film, she would have no trouble getting away with half-fare on public transport. Maybe that is the reason the bedroom scenes with Daniel Brühl, tame as they are, seem a little confronting.The escape, especially at the end, is standard Hollywood, but ""Colonia"" doesn't outstay its welcome. Despite not being an instant box office success, I think this film will eventually find an audience; it was out on hire for months at the Hoyts Kiosk where I eventually rented it – time will tell.",Colonia
17,areatw,"Shallow, predictable thriller filled with clichés and genre stereotypes",4,26 May 2018,"For a film that is supposedly based on a true story, 'Colonia' has the feel of a cheap thriller with a very shallow and underdeveloped plot. The story itself sounds interesting enough and it definitely had the potential to be an engaging and fascinating film, but the on screen execution is really poor, heavy handed and sloppily written in parts. To say that this film is overdramatic would be an understatement and it is riddled with clichés and predictable events.Despite the film apparently being based on a true story, much of what happens within the sect feels forced, unnatural and over the top. The violence and abuse seemed to be deliberately overdone for the 'shock factor', but in truth after a while it just becomes repetitive and uninteresting. It's also pretty easy to guess what's coming next and the ending is suitably lame and predictable. There is some decent acting, particularly from Michael Nyqvist, but that's about as far as the positives extend.",Colonia
18,muamba_eats_toast,Intensely enjoyable despite missing key points.,9,4 May 2020,I thought the film was actually pretty great Emma Watson and Daniel Bruhl worked together a lot better than I expected! The film was intense throughout and whilst it missed out a lot of the horrors that went on within the colony it is likely through the eyes of the 2 characters given how separated they were that they would not have seen the child abuse so it is not a problem for me as this is not a depiction of Paul Schaefer but of this couple. Highly enjoyable and would recommend.,Colonia

His girlfriend is an air hostess, this is Lena played by the wonderful Emma Watson. Then Pinochet and his army take over the democratically elected socialist Government; this was obviously with US backing.Well Daniel is soon swept up in the ruckus and taken to Colonia Dignidad. A colony run by another German called Paul Schafer; played brilliantly by Michael Nyqvist. He is a man who preaches the word of God but is one that talks the talk but does not reciprocate in the 'walking' department.Now the full extent of what went on at the real colony is still, allegedly, a matter of conjecture but I won't say anything unless you are not aware of it. However, this does seem to try to cover a lot of what occurred and it uses the relationship of the two main protagonists as the vehicle to do so. It is a thriller and it is well made but it lacks a certain something to kick it further into the 'must be seen' category. Fans of Brühl and indeed Watson will not be disappointed though as they both give great performances, but Nyqvist gets all the great lines in a pantomime baddie role that was great fun to watch (for all the right reasons). In English with some Spanish and; this is one for those who like their thrillers to be not too much of a stretch but still well believable and indeed watchable.",Colonia

21,dave-mcclain,"""Colonia"" takes a little-known chapter in history and spins it into an interesting and entertaining tale of romance and danger.",8,19 April 2016,"A religious cult in Chile run by ex-Nazis?!? It may sound like a bizarre work of fiction, but the location portrayed in the historical drama ""Colonia"" (NR, 1:50) was all too real (except for the fictional romance at the center of the film). But before I get into my plot summary, I think that a little historical context is in order: In September 1973, a U.S.-backed military coup wrested control of the government of Chile from democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende and placed power in the hands of army commander-in-chief Augusto Pinochet. Under his 17-year rule, dissidents were persecuted, arrested, kidnapped, deposed, tortured and murdered. Pinochet's government used the remote Colonia Dignidad (Colony of Dignity) as a place to torture and murder some of the regime's political opponents. The public face of the colony was that of a charitable and educational organization. It was actually a religious cult where former Nazi medic Paul Schäfer imposed a strict Baptist interpretation of the Bible on all of his followers, many of who had emigrated with him from Germany. He forced them to live in dormitories segregated by gender, and with parents separated from their children, whom Schäfer sexually molested.Daniel Brühl plays Daniel, a political activist from Germany who has been living in Chile for a few months working with a group of young people supporting President Allende. Daniel's girlfriend, Lena (Emma Watson), is a flight attendant who takes advantage of her week-long stopover in Santiago to spend time with Daniel. When a military coup suddenly drives Allende from power, the new government starts rounding up political dissidents, including Daniel – and Lena, who happens to be with him when he's arrested. In a soccer stadium, a man wearing a black hood identifies Allende supporters, including Daniel, who is whisked away in a van. Lena is able to trace the markings on the vehicle to the secretive and remote ""Colonia Dignidad"" compound, about 200 miles south of Santiago. She makes her way there and asks to join. ""I want to know the way of the Lord,"" she says, wearing a small cross around her neck.In her attempt to rescue her lost love, Lena is sacrificing her freedom – and putting her very life at risk. A harsh old woman named Gisela (Richenda Carey) takes her to meet the cult's leader, German expatriate and lay preacher Paul Schäfer (Michael Nyqvist). ""Once you join us, you must remain,"" explains Schäfer. Lena agrees, in spite of observing his Christian fanaticism and some of his innate creepiness. Gisela relieves Lena of the small bag she had brought with her, gives her a few items including a set of linen, and assigns her a bed in the female dormitory. Most of the women show no interest in talking to the new arrival, but Lena befriends another young woman named Doro (Jeanne Werner) and, later, another named Ursel (Vicky Krieps). As Lena joins the women in their daily work in the fields and in other food preparation activities, she learns what she can about the camp and keeps her eyes peeled for Daniel.Daniel has survived severe physical abuse at the hands of the Chilean secret police in the colony's subterranean torture chamber, but he is a bit worse for the wear. Besides his physical injuries, his speech is slurred and he now talks and acts like a child. Lena finally catches sight of Daniel when she steals a glance through the window of the colony's assembly hall during a men's meeting and is obviously concerned about his state of mind. Soon after, at a rare meeting with the cult's men and women all together, Lena takes the risk of approaching Daniel, hoping that the two of them can come up with a plan to escape the cult, something no one has done before. But there's much more at stake than ""just"" the fate of two young lovers. Besides the terrible ways that Schäfer uses and abuses his followers, it turns out that he's also into some other nasty business that further reduces even the slim chance that Daniel and Lena have to get away for good.""Colonia"" takes a little-known chapter in history and spins it into an interesting and entertaining tale of romance and danger. The story is perhaps best understood as a combination of ""The Boys from Brazil"", M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" and Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning ""Argo"" if you can imagine that. This film's unusual setting contributes to its originality, as does telling a story in which it's the woman who comes to rescue the man. The actors are well cast, and this accomplished multi-national ensemble consistently offers up lived-in performances. The direction, by Florian Gallenberger (who won an Oscar for his 2000 live action short film ""I Want to Be""), sometimes feels a little disjointed, but he mostly keeps things moving and builds some serious tension into the movie's plot. The script (co-written by Torsten Wenzel and Gallenberger) is creative and smart. There may not be much actual dignity in the Colonia Dignidad compound, but this film dignifies itself with some quality story-telling. ""A-""",Colonia
22,jrarichards,"Worthy and shocking, though rather hard to connect with",7,28 March 2017,"Florian Gallenberger's ""Colonia"" is a hard - if certainly worthwhile - watch, and for obvious and less-obvious reasons.For a start, and above all, it presents a persuasive, apparently-true story that never actually happened at all. I do not know if any non-Chileans caught up in Pinochet's (American-backed) 1973 coup against the democratically-elected (if Soviet-backed) Allende could conceivably have been seized and tortured in the way that Daniel Bruhl's Daniel is in this film (however close to the Allende cause they may have been), and - since the character portrayed does not really exist - I am reasonably entitled to question the whole scenario!Equally, I do not know if any German girlfriend would be brave-crazy enough to join (for months on end) a bizarre Nazi-German cult operating in the south of Chile in order to find and help out (preferably even break out) the aforementioned torture victim, given that the (huge-area) cult HQ was surreptitiously also being used by Pinochet's thugs - in uniform and out of it. In this case, however, Emma Watson's first-sassy and then uber-restrained portrayal of Lufthansa flight attendant Lena Kortus is so earnest, and her young-love dedication to and affection for her beau so persuasive, that the fictional story does at least hold its own. This kind of thing ought to have existed, even if it didn't!Ironically, that (and even Watson's quite-specific, if considerable, beauty) makes handling this film more complex for the watcher, not less, since the fictional story may actually get in the way of the largely-true background circumstance, that the (Initially voluntary-membership) pseudo-religious cult under leader Paul Schafer (here played marvellously well - and hence as a repellent and disgusting figure - by Michael Nygvist) did exist, did apparently entail brainwashing and brutal treatment, the violation of a whole list of human rights and widespread child abuse by its founder, and did apparently have a blind eye turned to it by the German Embassy (though this seems almost impossible to credit from today's perspective).And that brings us to another problem with/for ""Colonia"", given that the cult - at Colonia Dignidad (of all names, hence the title of the film), is presented so shockingly, if at times almost matter-of-factly, that we as normal audience-members simply cannot fully take it in. It is so remote from our experience, so implausible in its reality, that we can't fully connect with the story (thankfully, one might say).Yet a further issue is that someone first picking up the film may be inclined to believe they are mainly in for an Allende-Pinochet story, and indeed the first part of the film would give them every reason to believe that. But then we home in on Schafer's Colonia, and our attention is divided between the awfulness of the colony's role in backing Pinochet, and it's more general and hideous awfulness.The whole ""digestion"" process is helped along a little by the excellent British actress Richenda Carey, who puts in the performance of her career as head of the women's part of the camp, Gisela. This foul character nevertheless evokes the occasional micro-moment of sympathy, and that is a huge acting achievement in itself. Fellow Brit Julian Ovenden also has a bit-part that is more than that, given the way his Captain Roman Breuer has such a major role in anchoring us ever-so-slightly in the real world (even though he presumably did not exist, and his character did not do what is portrayed here, as presumably (???) no real-life airline pilot actually did).While many of us were alive and kicking in '73, the remoteness of that year is made clear by James Blunt's song and the amazing recreations of the BBC's wonderful ""Life on Mars"". But it still beggars all possible belief that something like Colonia Dignidad could have operated at that time. It must be fiction, yet it isn't, while the key love story on which this film hinges ought to have existed, but didn't. And thus to the whole issue with this compelling, well-acted and amazingly portrayed story that is certainly impossible to ignore.",Colonia
23,davyd-02237,"Unsuitable ""Family"" entertainment!",2,17 July 2020,"General Pinochet was a bully who murdered innocent people. this film tells one of the stories of a couple who are ""imprisoned"" on a colony run by a ""religious zealot"" - one who clearly likes boys, tortures men, hurts or murders women-who are ""devils"". this man has no morals and his job is simply to serve the President. Yes, it may well be historically accurate but DO NOT sit the family down to this one. It isnt an easy ""watch"" given that you do witness murder and torture and abuse of the women, from a variety of individuals who have been brainwashed. If Pinochet was put in his position by the USA, then someone has much to answer for. There may not be a need for such violence etc in order to tell a story of what 2 people went through. Dont be fooled by religious types such as ""Schafer"". You wont find his type in the bible-at least not in the ""Honest, God fearing"" ""Biblical Knowledge"" bracket.

25,garethcrook,Not for the faint hearted.,7,18 May 2018,"Starting with archival footage setting the scene, it's all very promising, for want of a better word. Then things get interrupted by the prolonged introduction of a love story between Daniel Brühl (who is very good) and Emma Watson (who sadly isn't). Thankfully, it gets back on track, charting the military coup in Chile by Pinochet in 1973, but that's not the focus here. There is some truly brutal stuff depicted, terrifying even and when terror subsides, sinister takes over, with Micheal Nyqvist exuding pure uncaring evil. Unfortunately Watson really struggles in this role, she doesn't quite fit... which is partly the point, but she feels jarring, rather than her simply being the empathetic character. It's based on a true story, how accurate I can't say, I'm not sure I could bring myself to research further, but if even a fraction holds any weight then the levels of appalling and detestable treatment of people here is completely dismaying. Does it work as a film? It does, but it could have been done better, although it's not for the faint hearted.",Colonia

As many of the top reviews mentioned, this a true story, or ""inspired"" by them, that needs to be told about relatively recent but virtually unknown history of Chile.I'm adding a review to the mix because the other reviews really didn't capture the problems of this film. The few that did were too fixated upon them and essentially didn't consider anything else the film has to offer. Then there were the usual fanboy reviews of one of the film's significant problems - Emma Watson's acting. During the most significant parts of the film, she was stuck. In the less important parts, she was cliché, stereotypical, and showing about as much skill as a teen horror chick.The other problem is that the director also failed in the same way, cliché, stereotypical melodrama hurting a story that didn't need it.Fortunately, the story and most of the other actors overcome the over-direction and naive acting.

27,coreyjdenford,Colony of abuse and lies,4,29 June 2016,"This is my review of Colonia (spoiler free)** (2/5) Cast: Emma Watson, Daniel Bruhl, Michael Nyqvist, Richenda Carey, Vicky KriepsPlot: A young woman's desperate search for her abducted boyfriend that draws her into the infamous Colonia Dignidad, a sect nobody has ever escaped from.Set in 1973 and inspired by true events you would think that this movie would have some kind of drama and/or story attached however it does not the only thing that lasts throughout the film is Lena (Watson) and Daniel's (Bruhl), chemistry but that is all that stands out. This film started as a pretty entertaining drama which escalated very unfortunately it escalated into a torturous diabolical white-knuckle entertainment film and things still take a turn for the worst. The film got its first appearance at Sundance in September 2015 and since then has had several nominations for German film awards what were they thinking? However since then it has had backlash mainly at German director Florian Gallenberger who was under wrath by Japanese Ultra-journalists by exposing, in 2009's John Rabe, the atrocities committed by the country's army in the 1937 Battle of Nanking. However since then he has been a little quiet until he released this atrocious drama. The only thing that is good about it is it has an interesting cast and great chemistry between two characters mainly Lena and Daniel but soon turns bad when Lena enters a cult, a religious cult of all things. Run by vicious antagonist Paul Schafer (Nyqvist) and then on things take a turn for the worst as this film adds torture and promotes abuse. The real Paul Schafer was imprisoned for 33 years for thousands of accounts for sexual abuse on women and children, he was imprisoned until his death in 2010. Another thing that is good about the film is the acting even though this film is absolutely terrible the acting withstands through. The best performance comes from all three main actors Emma Watson who hasn't had a big movie in a while and this is certainly better than Regression (2015) well not much. Daniel Bruhl has come heaps and bounds over the past few years mainly known for playing Niki Lauda in Rush (2013). Michael Nyqvist whose known for The Girl series the Swedish crime, drama and also Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (2011). However this is not the film to remember them by because it's not entertaining except perhaps the beginning and the end. This film will not be receiving any Oscar glory because even the Academy have taste. Other than forcing women to women to strip, calling them whores and sluts and even calling them c**ts among other things. This film also has no character development it leads the fact of you have to research the characters but no one can be bothered to do that so this film f***ed up as it is, is lacking in the one main thing that will make it that little bit better, and entertaining is that it is missing a story, well a good one anyway and also character development we just know their names and what they do that's it. Sorry to say this but it could have been a better if not for the director and of course the cast, because they do not make it a better experience and maybe that's because the director wasn't willing to make it better and his research is terrible. So as you can see this is just an experimental drama that is trying to be better than it really is.Here are some points as to why this is a poorly made drama: Poorly directed: The director even though he tries his hardest the film just lacks potential and also drama which has been said before but it might be because his research his terrible or he hasn't got any character development attached to this pitiful mess. The lack of direction just proves that he wanted to get this out quickly and instead of actually focusing on story he focused on the try-hard drama which fails to pull through after the first ten minutes he focuses on white-knuckle entertainment which is neither white-knuckle nor entertaining. Poorly executed directions. The one thing that you can praise about him is that he managed to say what happened to these characters in real life but the only good thing about it.Poor story: If there was one the story would actually be the best thing about the film unfortunately there is no story well if there if there is it is certainly hidden and also incoherent. Poorly executed story which could have been better if it was actually there. However it is a good subject to base a true story because the subject of Paul Schafer is really hit and miss so that is another thing to praise the film for however that is all it's good for. So poor story but good subject.Pointing out that this also has the exact same ending as Argo (2012) and The Last King of Scotland (2006) where they escape a dreadful place and a plane journey home it's exactly the same. Apart from the good subject and the good acting the film lacks in all its other things that it's supposed to be good for but is not. Again what were the German Film Awards thinking?Verdict: Notwithstanding any drama or engagement this is a poorly executed film with an interesting subject, the director decided to chose the darkest episode in life and put poorly executed characters and torture in the mix.4/10 appallingly put together.",Colonia

Colonia does this to a certain extend but when it doesn't do it, it almost makes a mockery of it. So what should've been an interesting movie ended up becoming weirdly cheesy and annoying; especially towards the end.A young German couple is trapped in Chilean military coup in 1973.

30,nicolechan916,Gripping,8,1 February 2017,"This is a really well made film.It is impressive at being full-on creepy, with many thriller elements, but also shines the light of hope which teases the audience. It is hard to believe that communities like this exist around the world - even today, but are hidden from sight. As they say,""out of sight, out of mind"". How do we prevent such communities from existing and gaining power when corruption is so abundant in many of these countries? It just gives me the chills and makes me feel so sad and helpless to know that this is real life. There is a great cast in this - looks like Emma Watson's name is coming up more often nowadays. Her and Bruhl have great chemistry on set, and are able to pull at the audience's heartstrings. What really sells the story though, is the expressions of Nyqvist. He sends chills through the screen with his cold stares and lack of empathy. Carey as well, does well as the harsh and unfeeling matron.However, it isn't really shown what Daniel was protesting against, or his motivation in doing so. We understand that both Daniel and Lena are foreigners, but how or why they came to Chile is a mystery. Additionally, the cinematography is great. There are quite a few scenes shot on a hand-held camera or that have unique angles and movement to them, and this goes well with the subject of the film. It helps to emphasize the desperation and panic that the characters feel in that particular moment. The visuals and color aesthetics serve well to compliment the film as well. With a lot of gray-scale and dark scenes, the movie takes on more of a thriller atmosphere. The screenplay and directing is great too, as filmmakers didn't explain things explicitly, but tended to show and imply things instead - involving the audience more by making them question what may be happening.

31,FallenEye,"Not so Snug a Bug, in a Rug.",7,27 May 2017,"So, was this film based on true events, like how Titanic was based on true events, because, what Lena and Daniel went through, is straight out of a movie.Without this picture showing us the true nature of what it means to be a part of the cause Daniel was fighting for, his brethren seem pretty selfish, cowardice and without integrity. They just seemed all too willing to allow Daniel to fend for himself.For me personally, it would've made more sense for the Allende supporters to be the ones who orchestrate some sort of rescue, instead of Lena, seeing as, the strength of Lena and Daniel's bond is a mystery. If anything, given what she said when she entered his home, one would believe they're only just really, getting acquainted. Unless, that was their idea of playful banter and flirting.Nevertheless, Colonia is quite intense, and Emma Watson gives a charming performance. Daniel Bruhl, perhaps not his best outing, but, he is proficient, and the composition is very capable.

With the same strategy, I just read the hypothesis a bit and then went straight to the movie. I have to say that the photography of the movie as well as the depiction of this close society was brilliant. I was amazed by the historical value of the movie that I was not aware of and it made me search so much online to get the facts straight after watching it. I think that this fact on its own, shows the great value of movies that go back in time, revealing the inconvenient truths of history. The plot was amazing and the script was unparalleled. I really enjoyed each part and the movie definitely kept me at the edge of my seat for the entire duration. The bad guy was portrayed excellently and the tension towards the end was almost unbearable! Both protagonists were excellent and it's nice to see Emma Watson being so much more than Ermione.

As Pinochet comes to power in Chile two German citizens get caught up in the revolution. They both end up prisoners in the Dignity Colony where torture and abuse hide under the pretext of religious fervour.Emma Watson and Daniel Bruhl lead. I believe it's a German production but is English spoken. Emma retains her English accent; probably wisely. Not sure if she lost weight for this role but if she did it was lost as she looked underfed before she arrived at the camp. They both put on a good performance but it's the supporting cast that convey the constant fear of living under such a controlling and cruel regime. It is oppressive but could be tenser.As a movie it's about twenty minutes too long but since it's based on fact I forgive it that. Think docudrama rather than adventure and you won't be disappointed.There is a torture scene, beatings - mostly off screen and moderate bad language. Child abuse is inferred.The Dignity Colony was set up in the 1950s but its most notorious period was 1961 to 1996 when the Pastor was Paul Schäfer an ex-Nazi colonel who later died in prison after being convicted of child abuse. He extended the 'colony' that was effectively a prison and military supply cache. Even after Schäfer the place had a bad reputation and weapons were reported found there in 2005.

When you realize this story is based on a real life place/person, and the abuse that took place here for years, it's horrifying. Film is often an effective and meaningful way to bring exposure and notice to true-life historical events and corruption. It can shine a light on things not always seen or reveal little known pieces of truth/history to a far-reaching audience. The fact that this place actually existed, that they were supported and allowed to get away with it for so long, and that it is a very little known historical event, add to why this film is worth viewing. The story is told through the eyes of Daniel, a pro-Allende German activist (Daniel Bruhl) and his girlfriend, Lena (Emma Watson.) Although some of the editing, the script, and the direction could have been fine tuned for improvement and a more solid movie, the acting was pretty good from all the leads. The film was insightful and kept me interested. (although spoken mostly in English, subtitles/captions on the DVD would have been helpful since there were many accents to contend with and some whispery dialogue) Colonia was definitely worth watching and very informative, IMHO!Helpful Hint: Stay tune at the end of the film for some real-life photos from Colonia Dignidad and updated info on the camp and it's depraved leader Paul Schafer.",Colonia

It is pretty hard to find a decent thriller now-days , everything is either too cliché or not interesting at all . This title is very solid , it has good actors and very well written script , the plot doesn't fail to surprise too. One thing i would say , is that this movie is not for the big screen , i think you should wait for it to come out on DVD or Netflix.

But, after a day in (my) work - after trying to convince other people at my working place for years to live a more solidarity, more human way with colleagues, by trying that, showing over years a good role model by myself. And yesterday, going out of the working place with the knowledge that nothing has helped - my colleagues still only interested in their own careers, without any empathy for the weak. Nothing can be changed in peoples hearts and minds after they have grown out of their childhood. And then, living in Europe, and recognizing that all politics - from left to right - get's sick and more xenophobic from day to day with the refugee-crisis fueled by inhuman politics... Yes, then such a movie is terrible refreshing. Here a writer, a director, a camera man, a cast prove that at least they care. If I would have a daughter like Emma Watson or a son like Daniel Bruhl I would be immensely proud. Yes it is acting. But, never-the-less you can see and feel - both of them care. It is highly sensible acting. A political statement in itself. Very glad, that my day ended with that relief. There are still some people out there, who care. Thanks, for that great movie.

Emma Watson is great in this and the creepy camp boss too, and other great performances are forged miraculously out of an anaemic script and often robotic dialogue. But it is well produced and visually meticulous and there's some great thrills, and good pace from start to end. The story arc can't be a surprise as the main narrator is well, is in it... I can understand if some find the glossiness and the Hallmark romantic component doesn't do justice to the abject horror of the actual historical setting, but as as say there's a compromise. One might argue that this more accessible picture helps to expose a chapter in world history that the more average movie-goer might well have missed or skipped altogether otherwise.

54,wentworthstreet,"Based on real life events, Colonia is a tough but rewarding watch.",8,3 May 2018,"I doubt I would have ever heard of this film had I not stumbled across it quite by chance a couple of days ago. Tucked away on the Sony Movie Channel in the UK, this is a movie that will stay with you and make you think. It is a crying shame this first rate film did not receive the publicity it so richly deserved on its 2015 release.Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid's Tale, said of her novel which was originally published in 1985, that when it first came out it was viewed as being far-fetched. However, when she wrote it she made sure that she did not put anything into it that humans had not already done somewhere at some time.Surely, the real life events of Colonia Dignidad must have informed at least some of the characters and events in Ms. Atwood's Gilead. Ostensibly a farm and religious commune, Colonia Dignidad was actually a secret detention camp for political dissidents and supporters of President Allende, ousted from power by General Augusto Pinochet during the 1973 Chilean coup d'état.In the film, lovers Daniel and Lena get caught up in the coup. They are both detained and rounded up with several others. Daniel, singled out by a hooded informant as being a supporter of President Allende, is then bundled into an ambulance and driven away. Lena eventually learns that Daniel has been taken to Colonia Dignidad where he is subjected to brutal interrogation and torture by Pinochet's secret police. Lena chooses to join the commune voluntarily in order to find him.Lena's first encounter at Colonia Dignidad is with 'Aunt' Gisela. Her second is with colony leader Paul Schäfer, a German Nazi working in cahoots with Pinochet's secret police . The former makes one recall the character of 'Aunt' Lydia from The Handmaid's Tale. The latter, every deranged, sexually abusive, paedophile cult leader known to history.We then follow Lena's quest to reunite with Daniel and the constant danger that surrounds their efforts to escape. During the course of the film, we also learn that staff at the West German Embassy in Chile are collaborating with the Pinochet regime. The cast is first rate. Daniel Brühl is excellent as always. Michael Nyqvist (who looks remarkably like fellow Swede Stellan Skarsgård) as Paul Schäfer is chilling and Emma Watson acquitted herself very well as Lena.Colonia or The Colony is a quality piece of film making that sheds light on a dark period of our recent history. It should also serve as a warning to future generations.",Colonia

Make and female members were in constant contact...it's the only way the ""family"" grew. And overall the members lived the life provided.

57,iSkyWalKing,Colonia,5,30 May 2017,"This is yet another propaganda piece from a mainstream movie that has an interesting enough premise to get a pass. I can be aware of the BS and still find redeeming qualities or enjoy a movie, the two are not mutually exclusive.The dialogue is rather contrived and pretentious, the 'politics' are very on the nose and predictable in that they are over the top, cliché and essentially just propaganda scratching at the surface of issues (first 25 minutes are dreadful), with exaggerated accents, cringey dialogue and ridiculous background acting. At about the half-hour mark, the film is saved due to the delightful emergence of Michael Nyqvist who gives a great performance as usual.The directing is sloppy at best, the editing is sloppy and every situation feels forced, contrived and/or unnecessary. I'll give one example in regards to a sloppy scenario to clarify my point, but know that these details are riddled and ignored through-out the entirety of the film...Lena decides to be clever and sneak her way out and peep in on one of the late night sessions. She has taken initiative and carefully worked her way into this situation. Yet, when peeking into the window, instead of continuing to be clever and remaining hidden (consistency), she starts practically leaning into the clearly lit up and visible window, and of course is spotted. It is now AFTER the fact she has been spotted, that she now tries to be clever again and run and hide. That whole scenario could have been avoided by simply being a little cautious. It's blatant inconsistent behavior to move the plot along and is an insult to the viewer. It really is. These very common details are in my opinion what can make or break a decent idea/film.All in all it is an unoriginal premise that IS interesting enough to keep you watching once you've started, has SOME redeeming qualities in that it gives some exposure into the cult-like religious world consisting of pedophilia and dominance and psychological torture etc. It is also shot well enough regardless of the poor editing and pacing. And Michael Nyqvist always manages to steal the show imo... But it is a typical propaganda piece in that there are a lot of fabrications in the movie (which is fiction), yet begins and ends on a ""serious"" political note with a clear angle leaving the viewer with a slanted impression of said nation. Hollywood loves to blur the lines because they underestimate the viewer...One final note, just some food for thought. Isn't it odd or a 'coincidence' that no subject is taboo in film making, and no nationality or religion or topic is off limits when it comes to film making in Hollywood except for 'that one'. You and I know the one. The one tribe/cult that has limitless amounts of films depicting them as 'victims', yet not ONE SINGLE FILM exposing their corruption politically, religiously, socially etc. (Don't believe me? Google it. Find me ONE major film that exposes their tribe in any shape or form. You won't find one.) Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and every other religion, nation or culture or subject is fair game to be criticized, but don't you dare make a film exposing said tribe on ANY matter otherwise you immediately fall into a 'negative'.

67,cinemacy,"Sacrificial torture and secret worlds, there is no shortage of surprises in 'Colonia'",7,27 April 2016,"Inspired by true events, Colonia is a Hollywood-style thriller about a couple who finds themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time- the torture prison of a religious cult under the influence of the Chilean secret police in 1974. At a time when Chilean youth began revolutionizing in the streets, one man's involvement with the movement along with his girlfriend's association in his anti-government views causes the couple to put their relationship and love for each other to the test. Directed by Academy Award winner Florian Gallenberger (Shadows of War), Colonia opens in theaters Friday, April 15th. Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"" accompanies archival footage of protesters rioting in the streets while the film itself is saturated in prime colors- magenta and royal blue. This juxtaposition of violence and R&B gives an artistic edge to the film's opening scenes, but unfortunately, this visual isn't sustained throughout the film. We meet our protagonist Daniel (Daniel Brühl), up on stage pumping up the masses of people, when, out of nowhere, he spots a bright yellow flight attendant's outfit (like a ray of Mr. Withers' sunshine) from the muted colors of the crowd. The woman is Lena (Emma Watson) and they immediately embrace. Their relationship isn't made entirely clear, but she only has four days in town and they plan on spending it together.While enjoying their time together, Daniel receives a phone call that shifts the political tide and changes everything. This results in chaos erupting in the streets, leading to their capture by the Chilean soldiers. Daniel gets abducted and taken to a hidden cult in a rural area called Colonia Dignidad, run by ex-Nazi Paul Schäfer (Michael Nyqvist). Left with no other choice, Lena willfully joins the Colonia as a desperate, last-ditch effort to find her boyfriend, risking her own life to bring him home as she discovers that those who enter the cult never leave.Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl play Lena and Daniel with an innocence about them that has you rooting for their success. Watson is unquestionably beautiful and smart, her outspokenness gets her into trouble. Brühl takes a more unconventional risk with his character by playing the role of a mentally challenged person in an effort to trick his captors into thinking he is not a threat. Watson and Brühl are crucial to the film's success, but individually speaking, these roles won't likely result in a significant boost to their careers.Colonia can't escape the comparisons to Eli Roth's The Sacrament or the documentary Kidnapped for Christ (if you haven't seen it, it's available to stream on Netflix, and is a MUST- watch), which may hurt Colonia's overall success because it is not as riveting by comparison. Audiences know what they are getting with an Eli Roth film, and a documentary has its own sense of wonderment, but Colonia tends to jump from the political thriller to love story to religious brainwashing in a patchwork way that feels a bit all over the place, and it is this ""clumpy"" genre blending that may be the film's weakest point. Plus, Daniel and Lena's relationship is never fully established in the beginning of the film, so we are left to wonder why she would risk her life to save this person.At its core, Colonia is an interesting story, but not a very memorable film. It doesn't provide enough tension to overshadow The Sacrament, nor does it have the foundation to be a solid romance. The fact that it is based on a true story is what keeps the film afloat and the inclusion the smuggled archival photos of the real Colonia Dignidad at the end is a much-needed gem. Yet, even with cinema-savvy actors Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl, Colonia can't quite seem to gain the traction needed to be a standout film.For more, visit: www.cinemacy.com",Colonia

The plot is very interesting, partially based on true events and good cast. Emma Stone performance is astonishing by the way. In addition, it makes a lot of people, who have not heard before about it, aware of the story of Colonia Dignidad. And what a story.. For all that I think the movie deserves an 8 and I need to say that I rarely rate movies beyond their IMDb rating. Now, why this movie is not Oscar-material or a 9-10 rated one? In my opinion, for two reasons. Firstly, it contains some plot holes and it is unrealistic at various points. I am not really obsessed with historical accuracy, but at some point the movie defies common logic (or at least mine). Secondly, it lacks a good soundtrack.

As an Emma Watson fan, I was not disappointed by her performance. She was solid throughout the film and played her part well. The other lead actor, Daniel Bruhl, was a nice surprise and handled his role well, especially when he was required to pretend to be brain danaged.
My favourite actress was Richenda Carey who played the evil old woman Gisela. She was awesome in that role and even though she was an unlikeable character I felt bad for her when she was hit in the head by Emma´s character.
I also completely respected Michael Nyqvist´s portrayal of Paul Schafer. I looked Nyqvist up and was disappointed to learn he had already passed away.
Some reviewers found the movie´s handling of historical events to be off, but I still learned a lot about Chile and its turbulent history. One of my favorite scenes was when Lena and Daniel get caught by autorities and are sent to a soccer stadium where Daniel is identified as a dissident.

Here, the opinions are divided: some people loves Pinochet's government and others hate it, but everybody can see the truth of Colonia Dignidad, a disgusting truth.
But, why did I not put the picture more stars? The answer is simple: this movie talks about a place were the most awful things happened while the picture gets a political sense putting more protagonism to the government of the time and its relationship with Germany. The thing I did not like in this trama is that it does not have context with the Chilean problems and the people's necesities.
As I said, the opinions of this political reality are divided, but something wrong is to show Pinochet's government as something bad, without talking of the previous governments. In Salvador Allendes's government, people died in streets and there was hunger and trouble anywhere, and they show the protagonist as a supporter of this government without showing the bad things of it. As well, they only show the bad thing of Pinochet's, but the truth is totally contrary.

Colonia reeks of Hollywood phoniness, especially an overlong and rather unnecessary chase sequence near the end that has no other purpose than to make the film long enough to count as a feature length film.Emma Watson can be a solid actress (see Perks of Being a Wallflower or The Bling Ring) but her performance is nothing more than adequate, and rather forgettable. Daniel Bruhl is solid enough, but it's obvious that both these actors are straining to bring depth and conviction to a flimsy screenplay. Michael Nyquist, however, is certainly chilling and downright loathsome, but even he is nothing more than a one-note villain.It's also a bad sign when there's a sense the director felt the only way to hold the audience's attention is through endless depictions of abuse and horrific implications of child sex abuse, only to cheapen it when throwing in typical thriller tropes for cheap, ineffective, suspense sequences. It makes the treatment of the true story seem exploitative and disrespectful to the actual victims who had to live through this atrocity.Colonia feels like a poorly written blurb you'd find in a history book in high school, and the bull shitted 5 page essay one would write just to get a passing grade.

Strange really given who Colonia Dignidad affected, and who were tortured, abused, held virtual hostage etc. I was in Chile at the end of the reign of the oppressive regime of Pinochet - and felt the film lacked the sound of the Chilean dialect (of Spanish). Maybe it could have included more of the direct and authentic voice of those who suffered. Or those who lived in the region. There were so many myths about the place in the media, in the streets, within the popular culture. Pity because this was a story that was worth telling.",Colonia
82,xuantungnguyen8,Truly worthwhile to enjoy on a blithe and carefree Sunday situation,10,20 April 2019,"I'd always love to watch the combination of romantic, history, action and drama genres as it brings us to peaks of emotions with unpredictability, obstacles, resolutions and surprises, and Colonia, directed by Florian Gallenberger, is a good example of that. Its great screenplay and visual effects have not only depicted the era of turmoil and unstability of Chilean society but also exposed the atrocities and savagery of manipulating organisations. Besides, outstanding acting performance by Daniel Brühl and Emma Watson has kept my eyes glued to the screen the whole duration as in the way they came into troubles and the unimaginable way the managed to get out.

83,alvaroweiss,Neither brilliant nor mediocre,7,24 April 2016,"This movie tells us the story of what happened in Chile whit in the grounds of Colonia Dignidad, a cult managed by Paul Schafer. It reflects the reality that people suffered inside the cult pretty well and it doesn't makes it see worse than here in Chile we think it was.Emma Watson's acting has that something special that you can find in all awesome actors. I like feeling that she is the character and the accepted this movie just because it goes perfectly whit her believes.The script is just right but it won't win an Oscar for that.

84,LilPo,Whatch it or watch it not,5,1 December 2018,"This movie was definitely less than I expected, tough I haven't been expecting much. The movie starts with Emma Watson finding his boyfriend - a German political activist in Chile. We don't really know why the guy is there, and what is exactly he wants from protesting in Chile. ""I've been here since four months and now Chile is my home"" - he said something like that, and these are his motivations according to the film's narrative.So then comes Emma Watson, who is desperately in love with him, however, they seemingly lack any chemistry along the whole movie. We don't get any hint from their background, about their bonds, so we just have to believe what the movie tries to tell. To be honest, when I've seen them kiss, it felt like a modest rape scene. (?)People here say how brilliant is Emma's acting, well, I could not forget for a minute that she is the actress, trying to act like somebody she clearly cannot sympathize with. Her acting is really really poor here, I'm shocked reading reviews telling otherwise.
Daniel Brühl was good, but did not really have the chance to shine. Nor the villain the ex-Nazi pedophile cult leader, who seemed to be evil but got really short screen time, to convince the viewers. You dont get to know anything form the rest of the characters, too,Well, and the movie, yes. It might have only been a shocker to those who have never seen a movie before :/ Even if it was based on a real story, it was showing a pretty few things, a documentary could be much more intense then this one. Somehow and I don't understand how this movie missed basically everything that could make it a good movie. Sad.",Colonia
85,VMDA,Uneven but complain gloom at political perversion,8,4 July 2016,"SUMMARY: Colonia presents a compelling portrait of two people caught in the ideological chess match played out in Chile by communism, democracy and the aftermath of WW II.Chile became a battleground for the ideologies of fascism, communism and US-style democracy. Thus you have the fertile mix of governmental change, ideological interference by the reigning superpowers, hidden liberties taken by fascists now enjoying tropical weather and a youth movement that believed change would be allowed without consequences.Into this historically true environment walk Lena (a flight attendant for Lufthansa Airlines) and Daniel (a cloudy-backgrounded German supporting the youth activists of Salvadore Allende). He's political and more than a foreign functionary but well less a true revolutionary or martyr (and here in lies the first of the uneven story lines). The first time we see these two, Lena's just finished her shift on an in-bound flight to surprise her boyfriend. Abandoning her co-workers to their hotel, she tells them she'll meet them in four days for the flight out.She doesn't make the plane. Paralleling the real events, Daniel is warned about the military coup and they are swept up in the martial law events that occur during the first 24-48 hours following the coup (another unevenness relating to WHY they draw attention to themselves). Daniel is taken to the facility for which the film is named: ""Colonia"" - The Colony. Lena is released.She seeks assistance in finding and retrieving her lover from the group he'd been associated with only to find the Chilean youths are hunkering down to ""fight the bigger fight"" now that Allende has been assassinated. Lena is alone in her decision to rescue Daniel.After a brief set of visits to unseen organizations, she finally gets some info and determines he's been sent to the Colony - a quasi-religious enclave run by an ex-pat German in the hills. Suffice it to say this is like every one of these isolationist extremist compounds where some ""leader"" paints himself as God-on- Earth and takes associated liberties.Without giving too much away, Lena integrates herself into the life that isn't life while searching for Daniel. Daniel is tortured; his future behavior comes as a direct result of his torture.Leading this is Pius. This character, while fictionalized, actually ran the real- world compound. There are men, women and children in this ""retreat"" - all held separately. Pius meets with them individually, as evidenced by a young boy who leaves Pius' office with silent tears raining down his cheeks (the implication is confirmed in a shower hymn sing- along). Brutality and sexual dominance keep inhabitants in line. Pius, as portrayed by Michael Nyqvist, lays on the misogynist paint pretty thickly: all women are sluts and whores; they ""stink"" of sin and the Devil within them. Pius never buys into Lena's desire for a godly life but doesn't truly discern her duplicity. What he does show is his close relationship to the junta and Pinochet: the compound produces both knock-off automatic weapons and poison gas for Pinochet.Lena navigates this psychological snake pit until she and Daniel are reunited. In the end, their exit to safety proves nowhere near as safe as it should have been.First, let me say that I enjoyed this film. Despite it's flaws it was thoughtfully done. While not as gripping as the Costa Gravas film ""Missing"", the feeling of fear is real. My gripes: (1) Daniel, supposedly in country only 4 months, isn't as credible as he should've been in the minutes leading up to their arrest. Possibly having him as a journalist would have made the backstory obvious. (2) Lena's ability to meet with groups she hopes to enlist in finding Daniel during a military coup needed more gravitas. One would reasonably expect foreigners to be under scrutiny and unable to move freely about Santiago without being watched or followed. Lena appears to do so unfettered. (3) Emma Watson, bless her heart, doesn't do pliant or fearful well enough to make the audience believe what she's experiencing in her dual challenges of (a) finding Daniel and (b) believably adapting to a way of life she has no preparation for. Ms. Watson isn't quite fearful enough. There's not enough play-acting to stay alive and in the good graces of the harsh women's matron ""Aunt Gisela"" and there's not enough sheer exhaustion from the backbreaking work the women do 24-7 (day and night shifts). (4) MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: I like tight plots. This one hangs together well until the LAST 2-3 minutes. As Daniel and Lena are escaping, the Pinochet government shuts their plane's clearance down. Lena, who knows the pilot, holds photos taken at the Colonia that will prove what she's just escaped from. Instead, she just begs the pilot to violate international protocol and take off. Because she asks him to. Not buying it.My kudos:(1) This is an intelligent film despite it's flaws. (2) This film is so relevant as it describes growing pains and atrocities that emerging countries and regions - used to dictatorships - experienced. The similarities between this film story and current events shouldn't be underestimated. (3) There are a number of solid (and really, really creepy) supporting performances. (4) The subtle question - whether foreigners/outsiders have the right to interfere and/or agitate - comes through almost every frame of films. The fascists and the communists aren't the only problems Chile has during this turbulent period - democracies failed them.",Colonia

This movie, my dear cinema-lovers will change you as a better person starting now when the titles roll up with the haunting violin serenade behind. A story of courage, sacrifice, LOVE and overall human solidarity is what makes this movie unique. Unsurprisingly, IMDb viewers gave it a low rating, given it did not have nudes or eroticism, but what it indeed have is a message that no matter the adversities, true human will triumphs over all. There are tons of movies out there where you witness atrocities that we humans commit on an everyday basis, make no mistake this is another movie that shall get its awards, its Oscars and then we shall all move on. But, what makes this one stand out, is the jolt it provides, the visual shame of our downfall as a collective being for our greed and hunger for power. If you are reading this, I implore you to watch this, not because you will evolve as a transcended human, but something to leave as a reference for your children to watch when they are of age and maturity.

The movie left me thinking and researching about its topic: Colognia Dignidad, a cult in Santiago de Chile. It conjures many ethical questions and portrays what humanity is capable of. The movie grips and doesn't let go of you till the end. The contents is real, except for the love story that forms the golden thread. One has to imagine that the movie portrays the life and the ways of Colognia Dignidad almost like a documentary without felt exaggeration, but it is still a movie with a story. Superb acting by Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl made the movie an even more intense experience. The only criticism I can make is that the love story is average in comparison to the rest.

Can't really get the hold of the two protagonists' personalities, Emma Watson suspiciously calm throughout the movie despite of seeing people killed and abused. Also, No person would join a questionable cult out of love, there should have been an other reason she ends up there. Was no embassy asked for help, no police etc. I understand that everyone is corrupt but you can't just decide to join in somewhere unknown without a plan. There should have been a lead up to this decision, being helpless and desperate.

I am happy they made a movie about something that isn't well known to everybody. This story is like 'Schrindler's list' but in a smaller scale and even more modern times. 2nd I completely disagree with the people (and especially one comment (the one who rated 1/10)). This movie should not be rated below 6/10. I putted 10/10 and can understand you go lower but below 6/10 you really don't have respect and you are probably not someone who likes movies similar to this one. For the guy who reviewed with a 1/10, I think you are a bit simple. Your review is just a summary of the movie in a 'ridiculous' way.

I was not disappointed- in fact I felt immediately captivated by this strange, overlooked corner of German/Chilean history told through a Hollywood lens.Indeed, elements of the story have surely been greatly warped to suit the silver screen (I am hardly knowledgeable about the true events on which Colonia is based) but I didn't feel that these changes distracted from the heavy message and dark history of the story. On the contrary, I felt that the movie offered a believable perspective of events while telling the story on an entertaining and multi-faceted level. In other words, Colonia offered the necessary respect for the history without leaving me deeply disturbed. Moved, certainly, but not disturbed as would be so easy with such a gruesome story. I appreciated the combination of action, drama, thrills, and romance. I thought Watson and Bruhl were excellent and well-suited to their respective roles; their chemistry was also good (surprisingly so, in fact). All in all I found the story kept moving and held my attention extremely well. I found myself on the edge of my seat and unable to leave without witnessing the conclusion! I would recommend this movie to anyone with the slightest interest in history, the struggle against oppression, or Emma Watson. ;) (She does does give a very nice performance)",Colonia

96,vanessa-m-barker,Raw Beauty,8,15 April 2016,"This one is a stunner. It's not a teary-eyed love story, nor one with battle scenes and screams of love. What is real love, versus the love on screen? Think of a big blockbuster and look at the love story, and it's the cliché kind of love. This movie has yes, a fairly typical love story; they get separated, one goes after the other, risking everything, and they survive. However, this film goes beyond that. The introduction is pretty hasty, and it is obvious the plot is advancing fast to get to the juicy stuff. Yet, despite the obvious establishment of setting, character, motivation, and the works, the progression is logical and flows nicely. The beauty of it is that everything is condensed to what is necessary. Not everything needs to be shown blatantly, so long as it is understood. The scene in the beginning where the girl is taking pictures of the man's butt, and they're giggling and horsing around, is romanticized, but there's no billowing drapes, no bursts of sunlight, giving an absolutely perfect feel to the relationship. It is established that the dude takes pictures, and he is skilled at it, but it doesn't linger too long on that, and we understand without extra drama added. He's captured and she runs off after him. The typical scene of ""should I go, should I not, should I, should I not"" wasn't even alluded to. We all know that they will always go. She comes home to his ransacked apartment, and there's no wonder in that scene. It's all, ""ok, what do I need to do."" She's going after him, but how? We wonder how, and we get our answer. Not directly which is beautiful It is inferred and we see it, but it's not thrown in our faces. The next thing we see is her in a very conservative outfit, obviously in costume to do something, and the cross seals the deal. I watched this movie purely because the title looked interesting, and they got a very famous actress to star in it, so it must be half decent. I was completely unaware of what this was a about, yet I still got the whole thing. I knew it was religious, and I knew that it was what she had to do. There's a lot of scenes in this movie just like that, and things are just inferred but not to the point where you're not sure. I won't hit on everything, but another one of these was the little boys. From the start, the head dude running the cult was obviously doing this more than for just the power and to use God. Her first encounter with a normal person from the cult besides the cranky lady is the boy, and your first thought is abuse. The man, and the door, and you just know he is not pure by any means. Another, beautifully subtle yet easily discernible at the same time was the chorus of half-dressed boys in the bathroom. He conducts them and is very engaged in the feel of the music. He walks up the boys, standing very close, hands on some of their bare shoulders, large belly in the face of those directly in front of them, and he never even looks at the little boys, yet we know. He sends three boys off to shower while the rest sing loudly. The boys systematically showers, and the man walks up to the line of showers, and simply removes his shoes, and scene. And we get it. This movie has flaws like all movies do, and there are some clichés thrown in there, such as the fast introduction, and the typical plot, but I encourage you to watch this with a keen eye. It is a beautiful and haunting story that isn't over-dramatized like many movies are. This one is very to the point and subtle, and you understand it all with no background knowledge. If you're looking for a raw well-done film with a rich historical background, this one is the one for you.",Colonia
97,jason-carr1-719-551711,good but missed an opportunity,7,6 March 2018,"Having researched colonia dignidad for some years I was looking forward to seeing how brave the filmmakers would be at addressing some of the underlying 'rumours' surrounding this place and its real structure, sadly they have not don't the story justice.... the movie is however a good thriller and part way to showing what a inhumane creature paul shafer was.
I would have liked to have seen the makers explore the bigger questions such as:
1/ are we really expected to believe that an ex Nazi paedophile was backed by not just the Chilean government but also the German embassy, would these people really put their heads on the line just to protect one rather unimportant man from doing something despicable? they would however do it to protect something far larger and far more powerful........
2/ who was really behind the weapons manufacture at the colony, as I assume it takes more than a low level Nazi paedophile to create a weapons manufacturing plant, let alone chemical weapons
3/ to build such a complex as colonia dignidad along with its enormous military grade subsystem would take some serious financial backing and purpose other than a paedophiles playground
4/ we saw a shot of the advanced (for its time) radio room but no questions as to why it was there, also no mention of the enormous radio antenna on the estate... does a insular cult camp need mass communication?
5/ no mention of post war Nazi escapee's who according to witnesses visited and had a role there

Set During the 1973 coup in Chile, Emma Watson's character falls for her revolutionary boyfriend who gets arrested during the coup and is sent to the little known 'Colonia Dignidad' a Germanic themed cult with a large compound in the south of Chile and close ties to the Military regime. Watson's character sets off to join the cult to help him escape. So far so good. However, the depiction of Colonia Dignidad is so far off how a cult operates one wonders if the writers have even bothered to investigate how cults work. This was a self-regulating concentration camp with no obvious reason for anyone to want to stay other than fear. Yes, I know cults use fear, but they don't recruit that way. There was no love bombing or giving acolytes a yearning to belong to these friendly people who all think the same way as them. If all a cult offered was misery and endless toil they wouldn't recruit anyone! I believe that if the dynamics of how cults operate had been investigated, it could have turned a very good film into a great film. Sadly the clichéd depiction of the cult at Colonia Dignidad is the only disappointing part of an interesting film.",Colonia

The early minutes of the film pass to the character and focus on the love relationship between Lena (Emma Watson) and Daniel (Daniel Bruhl) in a way that we love to watch their love affair until the end!
And When we are well interested in characters, this is the director who plays with our emotions and shows us the dark history of South America and the death of love and humanity in the Colonia Dignidad prison of the country of Chile and we can't do anything but being Sorry for a humans who abuse the ignorance of the people to achieve their own interests, and being sorry for people who have been plunged into the abyss of blindly slavery because of lack of use of thought and wisdom.

109,juliacintolesi,Low commitment with history resulting in a shallow plot.,2,12 January 2019,"This film miserably failed at it's two main objectives. First, make the Colonia Dignidad story known and second, telling a love story.
The plot is orientated towards the fictional romance between Lena and Daniel, a young foreign couple that get ""stuck"" in a cult during Pinochet's dictatorship. Most of the film is located in the rural side of Chile, were a group of German inmigrants build a closed community that holds various kinds of abuse, from sexual to religious. All of this happens during warlike times, when people were persecuted by the military government (right fascist) for their political orientations (communists). This systematics human rights violations permitted the development of Colonia Dignidad with the State's concent.
The poor engage with the historical context and the political situation makes this fil superficial and empty. It almost seems like the creators used this story to justify the sadistic performance of the cult, rather than making this a documental thriller. There is no commitment whit history which is reflected in the non-existing participation of chilean producers or actors, and the total lack of Spanish and chilean cultural symbols.
As far as the love story goes, there is uncomfortable distance with reality, as it focus on the feats achieved by the couple instead of their actual love.
In overall the plot is predictable and not exciting to watch. The responsibility of narrating true events like this is not meet. It devalues the harshness that the people experienced in order to make a shallow tale.",Colonia
