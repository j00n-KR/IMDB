0,TheLittleSongbird,Jason Voorhees rises again,6,8 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off.People have cited 'Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives' as one of the best of the 'Friday the 13th' films. Having re-watched it since saying in my review for the fourth film that 'The Final Chapter' should have been the last, actually the film was much better on re-watch. While far from perfect, it is agreed that it is one of the series' better ones, perhaps the best since the second film and the best post-'The Final Chapter' instalment. Wouldn't go as far to say it's the very best though.Starting with the strengths, 'Jason Lives' starts off incredibly well. The opening is creepy and there is also a witty James Bond parody credits sequence that one does not expect in a 'Friday the 13th' film. It is a highly atmospheric and stylish film visually, while not having the great effects and make-up work of the previous film 'Jason Lives' is still one of the best looking films in the series. The music is suitably haunting. 'Jason Lives' surprisingly is one of the better acted 'Friday the 13th' films and has some characters one cares for (especially Tommy) when they are not making illogical or stupid decisions. Thom Matthews is the most conflicted of the actors playing Tommy, while Jennifer Cooke has allure and CJ Graham has an unnerving presence when he is not made to act goofy.There are some darkly funny moments, the deaths (not an overload this time like 'A New Beginning') are inventively elaborate, there is some creepiness and the pace generally cracks like a whip, 'Jason Lives' is certainly not dull. However, the tone of 'Jason Lives' is rather unbalanced. There is too much of an emphasis on the humour, and while there are funny moments others are rather cheesy and stupid. While there is creepiness, the suspense in between is not enough and likewise with the scares, which were also pretty tame this time round.Namely because there are some unintentionally goofy moments with how people are made to act (including Jason) and the writing-a-whole-novel-worth list of goofs. Some of the pacing is rushed, especially towards the end. The dialogue continues to evoke a constant feel of toe-curling cringe.Overall, a resurrection worth checking out. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
1,Leofwine_draca,One of the best of the series - a real surprise,6,19 July 2016,"This is a surprisingly (especially when you consider the subject matter) light-hearted take on the Friday the 13th saga, even more so than the previous instalment. In truth there weren't really many ways they could take the series now aside from remaking the same movie over and over, so adding in humour appeared to be the best way to attract audiences. This is by far the most polished of the series so far, with colourful, crisp photography and involved camera-work.Unfortunately, though, in many ways the formula stays the same. The acting is typically bad, aside from Thom Mathews (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD), who plays Tommy Jarvis this time around. Mathews is pretty good at doing frightened/intense schtick and he's the best person in this film. This film starts off excellently, with a cool scene involving Jason's maggoty corpse being struck by lightning (!) and revived, and then doing a neat pastiche of the James Bond opening titles! Yes, this movie is indeed full of in-jokes and self-referencing in places, like when an old codger mugs to the camera while saying ""some folks 'a got some strange ideas of entertainment...""! Jason looks pretty good here, now definitely a zombie - nobody could take the amount of punishment he has over the years, then rot in a coffin for a dozen years and survive. He takes a beating again this time around, and at least the actor playing him actually gives him a (somewhat limited) personality. The death scenes mainly consist of people having their heads crushed between Jason's hands (I take it he enjoyed this particular method of destruction from Part 3 so much he had to try it again), getting decapitated, pulled to pieces, and snapped in two. There's nothing spectacular but at least the film appears to be less butchered than some of the other films. Overall, this episode is fairly slick, sick and enjoyable, and one of the best of the series. Makes a nice surprise from the moronic humour of Part 5 and the deathly-dull retread that Part 4 was.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
2,SnoopyStyle,"Jason resurrected, Part V abandoned",5,16 October 2013,"They have basically ignore Part V where Tommy Jarvis becomes the new Jason. In this one, Tommy escapes from an institution and tries to destroy Jason Voorhees' body. When he digs up the body, a lightning strike resurrects Jason and he's up to killing again. Tommy tries to warn the sheriff, but the town wants to leave its past behind. Nobody believes him, and the sheriff locks him up.This movie accomplish one thing. It brought Jason back. He's now solidified as the emotionless unstoppable killing machine. The detour in Part V has been completely abandoned.There isn't much originality left. It's just killing for killing's sake. A lot of the kills are too random. People shows up. People gets kill. It's barely watchable. The addition of the little kids is pretty good, and had some real scares. Ultimately killing a bunch of no names isn't that compelling.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
3,claudio_carvalho,This Part is a Little Better Than Parts IV and V,5,27 January 2004,"In a stormy night, Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews, the third different actor to perform this role) goes with a friend to a cemetery, looking for Jason' s grave. He wants to be sure Jason is really dead and put fire on his body. There, a ray reaches Jason and brings him to life. Jason goes to former Lake Crystal camp and starts killing again. The local Sheriff Michael Garris (Davod Kagen) does not believe in Tommy and thinks he is the killer. Only his daughter, the dumb blonde Megan Garris (Jennifer Cooke) has faith on Tommy and helps him. This part is better than parts IV and V. The actors and actresses are much better than those in the previous movies. The revival of Jason is very similar to the creature of Dr. Frankenstein coming to life. Unfortunately, the writer and director Tom McLoughlin has not had the courage to make Jason kills the children in the camp. The modus operandi of Jason would never allow them to escape without being killed. The character of Megan is irritatingly stupid, provoking inclusive the death of her father. My vote is five.

4,kosmasp,It's alive,7,8 November 2020,"Well I guess ""alive"" does not really do it justice - him justice. Jason is not a zombie though, if anything he's (Frankenstein) monster. After the fifth movie went ahead and did a ""first"" one (in putting someone else in Jasons outfit and not Jason himself), this returns to yours truly ... truly and really. But how can that be, after he died in Part 4 you ask? Well easy! The character from 4 and 5 returns that still holds a grudge against him to ... finish the job? Yes it is as stupid as this sounds, but how else where they going to return him? Oh not care what happened previously? Maybe that would have been a better choice for some.Whatever the case, Jason is back and if he seemed unstoppable before, he literally is now. This may contain the least amount of nudity of them all and still had to be cut because ... MPAA and violence. Certain scenes can be found on the various discs avaiblable of course. The movies, this included do what they are supposed to ... kill off teenagers. Though they don't necessarily have to have done anything! Like having intercourse or smoke the weed ... and there is some humor in this too. I mean it's part 6, you had to include fun, yes? Some may hate that, but it never makes fun of Jason particularly (rather the situation overall, as in ""no one wearing a mask has good intentions"" - may not be the actual dialog) ... so either you are into these or you are not, but well made they are. Even for their age and considering the budget they had",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
5,gavin6942,One of the Funnier Ones in the Series,6,14 June 2007,"Tommy Jarvis, all grown up and out of the funny farm, just can't believe Jason Voorhees is really dead. So he goes to the cemetery and digs Jason up. Poor timing and a bad idea, because thanks to movie magic Jason is hit by lightning and re-animated, creating a serial killer zombie who is even more unstoppable than before. How do you kill a monster that's already dead? I think a lot of people really dislike this film. But those are the people who take these films too seriously. None of the Friday the 13th movies are actually good (although I'm partial to ""Jason Goes to Hell""). But they're fun, and this one really adds to the fun by adding in more dark humor and audience participation. (At one point, a character evens talks to the camera, revealing he knows full well he's in a horror movie. Another character also references being in a horror movie, though not to the camera.)Sequels bring more gore, more nudity and a higher body count. While this one lacks the nudity, and the gore is nothing special, the body count certainly is higher. A sheriff's department, a series of camp counselors, a paintball expedition, and something like twenty little kids are all potential victims. Oh, I forgot Tommy's friend and a groundskeeper. So, yeah... there's a little bit of carnage here.Any complaint I have could be written off by the fact it's part six in a series of horror movies. At this point, films really shouldn't even be this good. The way Jason is defeated is a bit hard to believe (sorry if that gives anything away, but there's five more films in the series so I think you know he lives). And I wish they had not switched actors that play Tommy Jarvis. But these are minor issues.In my opinion, parts four, five and six are the best in the series until part nine. They have a strong grasp on who their audience is and what they want to see. At least, that is if they assume the audience is me. And as I say, if you made it this far in the series, you may as well just keep going. It's going to pay off after a few more films.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
6,jboothmillard,Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives,5,9 September 2015,"The previous film was good, but it got you questioning a little whether the real hockey mask, machete wielding psycho killer was involved or not, but this sixth instalment gets things back on track by bringing him back properly. Basically Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews), from the previous two films, has returned to the grave of killer Jason Voorhees (C.J. Graham), he still suffers from hallucinations of the night he killed him as a child, and other visions. Tommy wants to be certain that Jason is dead for good by cremating his body, once the coffin in unearthed and the corpse is unleashed he stabs the body in anger with a metal fence post, all the sudden in the stormy weather, lightning strikes the metal, this revives the body of Jason to become an undead walking zombie. Tommy runs in terror and tries to warn Sheriff Garris (David Kagen), only to be shunned, Camp Crystal Lake was renamed Forest Green because the townspeople do not want to associate with the previous history of the killer, now considered urban legend. At Camp Forest Green, kids have arrived ready for outdoor adventure, teens running the camp, and hanging around for their own reasons, including sexual, are the Sheriff's daughter Megan (Jennifer Cooke) and her friends Sissy Baker (Renée Jones), Cort (Tom Fridley), Darren (Ghost's Tony Goldwyn), Lizbeth (Nancy McLoughlin) and her sister Paula (Kerry Noonan), and Nikki (Darcy DeMoss). Tommy is escorted out of town and told that he should leave and not return, or face arrest, Megan finds him attractive and seems willing to help him prove his claim that Jason is back from the dead and is on the rampage, still killing pretty much anyone, in a vengeful mode, for the death of his mother. Jason's killing methods include punching a heart out, impaling with the metal rod that resurrected him, killing four in a paintball game for their equipment, crushing a skull, ramming a bowie knife into the skull, stabbing the throat with a broken bottle, a head twisted clean off and many more. Tommy is implicated for the killings perhaps once or twice by the sheriff, of course he realises the truth too late, Tommy is convinced he can exorcise back into the lake, where he was drowned as a child. In the end Jason, who was stalking the camp huts, where the children were sleeping, is lured into the lake by Tommy, they struggle on a boat, but with a chain wrapped around his neck to a boulder, Jason is dragged underwater, he is not drowned but it seems he cannot get out, he remains a prisoner at the bottom of the lake, for now. Also starring Vincent Guastaferro as Deputy Rick Cologne and Ron Palillo as Allen Hawes. Jason was unstoppable before, but now being a zombie it seems his is indestructible, and that is exactly what you want, he continues his high kill count with another bunch of inventive and grisly deaths. The opening of the film has Jason imitate the James Bond opening credits gun barrel, there are other witty moments along the way, the slight storyline continuing helps it flow, and the song ""He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)"" by Alice Cooper playing in the end credits is really catchy, this is certainly one of the most memorable of the sequels in the franchise, an entertaining horror. Worth watching!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
7,Tweekums,Jason is back from the dead,6,10 January 2019,"In Part Five the viewer wondered whether Jason was back from the dead for most of the film... in this one there is no doubt. Tommy Jarvis and a friend go to the cemetery to dig up Jason in the belief that seeing his body will end Tommy's nightmares... unfortunately a lightning strike reanimates Jason. Tommy's friend is killed but he escapes and alerts the local sheriff. Not surprisingly he isn't believed and when Jason starts killing again it is believed that Tommy is doing it so he will be believed. Around about the same time the first group of children and councillors arrive at Camp Forest Green, not realising that area was renamed from Crystal Lake. Tommy, with the help of the sheriff's daughter, determines to defeat Jason again... but before they confront each other many unsuspected people will die.It becomes clear from early on that even though this is still pretty gory it is also being played for laughs much of the time. This film also gets rid of the gratuitous nudity that the last couple featured; probably a good choice as it didn't add anything to the story. I know many don't like the previous film because it wasn't really Jason, and I can understand that, I preferred that to the unstoppable zombie we have now. That said the way he returned, in the manner of Frankenstein's Monster was rather fun. The vast majority of the characters served little purpose other than to be killed by Jason, and in one case provide him with a new machete. Having children at the camp was a bit of a distraction; even though everybody else was fair game nobody watching is likely to think the children are likely to be harmed... even the kids talking about their expected deaths don't seem scared. Overall I was a bit disappointed in this; although I confess that might be because the friend who lent me the disc said it was 'awesome' leading to too high expectations. Anyway if you enjoyed previous instalments give this a go... you might agree with my friend.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
8,BA_Harrison,"After taking a break in Pt. 5, the original 'man behind the mask' is back.",5,14 December 2008,"In an effort to breathe some life back into the ailing franchise, and also to compete with new maniac on the block Freddy Krueger, the people behind Jason Lives add a mystical slant to their story, confirming what most fans had already suspected: that Jason is no ordinary flesh and blood mass psycho, but rather an unstoppable manifestation of pure evil.Part 6 sees the return of the superhuman, machete-wielding hulk after his nemesis Tommy (Return of the Living Dead's Thom Mathews) unwisely decides to exhume the killer's body in order to cremate it; however, rather than putting the evil to permanent rest, he accidentally revives the maniac, who immediately resumes his killing spree.With the help of Sheriff's daughter Megan (Jennifer Cooke), Tommy attempts to correct his mistake by luring Jason to Crystal Lake (now renamed as Forest Green by local authorities keen to forget the area's grisly history) where, according to an occult handbook, the maggot-ridden murderer can finally be laid to rest.Directed by Tom McLoughlin, who would later tackle several episodes of the Friday the 13th TV series, this outing for Jason turns out to be a fairly routine slice of popcorn horror despite its interesting supernatural spin. Once Jason has been brought back to life, the film becomes nothing more than a rather bland series of deaths, with a smattering of not-overly-explicit gore, and one obligatory sex scene (but no nudityand that's unforgivable!).Add to this some very silly bits of dumb humour, including a Bond-style title sequence with Jason throwing his machete at the screen, a couple of wise-cracking kids, and several stupid executives playing paint-ball in the woods, and this tongue-in-cheek sequel can't help but be something of a disappointment for those who like their stalk and slash a little more serious and a lot more scary.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
9,paul_haakonsen,Jason reinvented...,8,28 December 2015,"I have fond memories of this movie from way back in my early teenage years. I remember watching it many times on VHS back then, and I still find it enjoyable and entertaining today. Especially since I am a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies.This movie took Jason and turned him into so much more than what he had been in previous movies. Why? Well, he was buried and dead, then unearthed and came back to life more menacing than ever. And this movie started the gradual decaying state that Jason took on in the following movies.In this sixth movie, Tommy Jarvis wants to permanently destroy the body of Jason Voorhees and with it the cause of his nightmares and mental torment. But you can't keep Jason down and he is brought back to life by the force of lightning, wrecking havoc and death to all in his path.There are many memorable death scenes throughout ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"", and it will more than keep you gorehounds happy.The cast in the sixth movie were well-cast and the actors and actresses did good jobs with their given roles. Thom Mathews and Jennifer Cooke did well in the lead roles. And while C.J. Graham is no Kane Hodder, then he still did a very memorable performance as Jason. The movie also has good performances by David Kagen and Ron Palilo. It even has Tony Goldwyn in it as well.""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" stands as one of the best additions to the ""Friday the 13th"" legacy.And you can watch this sixth movie again and again, if you can manage to elude that oncoming machete.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
10,Quinoa1984,Meaningless,7,8 October 2000,"This film is as meaningless as the entire TV series disaster that was known as Felicity.  Think about it, sure part 5 sucked liek airplane food but at least it tried to put an end to Jason.  Here, we see a ressurection of him that is both improbable and uneeded as he is struck by lighting and back to life an d killing innocent kids and teens.  And while some might find it cool to see a Jason-monster from Dr. Frankenstein, I find this film is the reason that parts 7, 8, 9 and the upsoming 10 were made (despite one part enjoyable).  D+",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
11,BandSAboutMovies,I actually love this one!,8,13 April 2018,"Directed by Tom McLoughlin, a veteran of plenty of made for TV movies and Sometimes They Come Back, as well as playing the robot S.T.A.R. in The Black Hole and Katahdin in Prophecy, this is the film where Jason became fully supernatural and it's also one of the few films in the series to get good reviews, probably due to the amount of humor throughout.The original plan was for Tommy Jarvis to become Jason, but audiences were pretty unhappy with that hint at the end of the last film. So this one begins with Tommy (Thom Matthews, Return of the Living Dead) heading to Jason's grave to destroy his body so that he can never come back. But of course, as soon as he stabs the murderer with a metal fence post, lighting strikes him and he's back from the dead - and kills Tommy's friend Alan (Ron Palillo, Horshack from TV's Welcome Back, Kotter) right away.Tommy freaks out and heads to Sheriff Garris' office and the lawman locks him up, thinking that this is all in his head. The truth is that Jason is back and he is on a rampage, killing camp counselors Darren (Tony Goldwyn, Carl from Ghost) and Lizabeth. A whole new crew of kids go looking for them and despite Tommy's warnings, they think of Jason as only an urban legend.This time, Jason is stopped by being chained underwater, but even at the end, his eyes are wide open and he's obviously ready for more.Again, this movie was a major big deal in my teenage years, particularly because it had a music video for it! ""He's Back (the Man Behind the Mask)"" by Alice Cooper announced that Jason had survived the final chapter.The working title for this installment was Aladdin Sane. I really enjoyed this installment, which even has a nod to James Bond in the beginning. In our movie hallway, we have several versions of the poster for this one. It's nearly a comedy in parts, but still has a great plot.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
12,Coventry,Jason is back...and he's here to STAY !!!,6,21 September 2003,"We've come to part 6 of the Jason Vorhees saga. The producers didn't make the same mistake again. Jason is a star and he is needed for this series. ( just ask the Halloween makers how much they needed Michael Myers after Halloween III ). Part 5 handled about a copycat killer and most fans of the series ( including myself ) didn't like this a single bit. The need for Jason was so big around this time that he came back enormously. More powerful and satanic than he ever was. I think this was THE movie in which Jason deserved his status of immortal horror icon the most.
SMALL SPOILERS .... It's a fully grown up Tommy Jarvis ( the kid who beat Jason in part 4 ) who is responsible of the resurrection of Jason. It's his own goddamn fault, he should have left his grave alone instead of trying to send him to hell for good. Anyway, no complaints from me because this stands for the best opening in ALL Friday the 13th movies. Jason's corpse gets hit by lightening and not only is back among the living, he's now more powerful than ever. ( he rips of people's heads and arm like they are gingerbread men ). At the meantime, Camp Crystal Lake changed his name in favor to get rid of the bad reputation and opens its doors again. It's friday the 13th and they're are lots of counselors waiting to be slaughtered again...the ideal Vorhees atmosphere. Tommy is having trouble to explain it all to the local sheriff but the daughter is willing to help him. Tommy thinks he can only finish Jason once and for all by bringing him back to the exact same place where he died at young age. Of course that easier said than done... END SPOILERS !!!The bigger budget obviously saved this episode. We get to see a lot more Jason than we ever did before and his killing spree is shown much more detailed. Every slasher fans dream, in other words. The plot is of course dumb and far from original but few people care about that, I think. The writers did try to come up with a few nice elements ( for example: the actual presence of young children which helps to build up the tension ) but, in general, the story is too weak to speak about a good horror film. Although, while watching this film, it occured to me that this cast contains several people who actually CAN act ! The girl who plays Megan ( Jennifer Cooke) and the sheriff ( David Kagen ) belong to the best actors this series had so far. Compaired to part 5: A new beginning, this sequel is recommended for every horror fan and especially for the fans of the series...although this episode contained NO nudity at all ! what the hell is that about ??",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

14,hitchcockthelegend,Jason 6: Welcome To Camp Blood!,6,15 January 2017,"An absolute hoot of a addition to the Friday 13th franchise. As is often the way with the ""Friday"" sequels, you can talk to one horror fan and this is the worst of the bunch, talk to another and it's the best etc etc. There's a more airy touch here and it serves the formula well, which if the series' fans are honest, is a formula that was getting stale quite early in the chain, so any sort of new ideas or direction is most welcome. After a glorious James Bond parody opens the credits sequence, accompanied by Harry Manfredini's superbly thunderous musical score, we get long running tormented character Tommy, here played by Thom Matthews, digging up Jason Voorhees' corpse so as to make sure the evil one is dead - oh and to kill him again. Enter a glorious Frankenstein homage (cheeky steal if you like) that sets us up for another round of stalk and dismember as Jason heads back to Camp Crystal Lake, which is now called Camp Forest Green!The kills are not particularly inventive, but there's a real thud of humour about much of them. From an American Express Card to a bloody smiley face imprint, it's clear the makers have a glint in their eyes. We even get an early appearance from Tony Goldwyn, some four years before Ghost would make him a known name. Adding to the quality score, which BTW rattles around home cinema speakers lie a supernatural entity, is Jon Kranhouse's cinematography, which is gorgeous in colour lens selections. All that and you get an Alice Cooper soundtrack as well. From joyful reanimation to a suitably watery finale, this part 6 delivers more than enough to almost make you rush out to rent part 7.

15,Hey_Sweden,"""So, what were you gonna be when you grew up?""",8,20 May 2013,"Writer / director Tom McLoughlins' entry in this long running series isn't about to mess too much with a winning formula. What he does, first and foremost, is introduce an element of humour into the mix, even using it to make an amusing commentary on fans of this type of thing! Some series devotees don't care for the comedy, but others see it as a breath of fresh air.At this point in the series, it wasn't exactly out of line to start getting self-referential with the material: one character remarks that men in masks are usually not so friendly. McLoughlin also has a minor character break the fourth wall to let us know that, yeah, this kind of entertainment ain't exactly Shakespeare, and maybe you gotta be a little strange to really get into it.The third part in the ""Tommy Jarvis"" trilogy segment of the franchise, it picks up as Tommy, now played by Thom Mathews of ""The Return of the Living Dead"", is out of a mental institution and *still* clearly not right in the head. He's obsessed with getting revenge on Jason, to the point where he and an ill-fated friend (Ron ""Horshack"" Palillo) intend to dig up Jasons' body and cremate it. But things go predictably wrong and a resurrected, now seemingly invincible Jason returns to his old stamping ground Crystal Lake, now renamed Forest Green by a community desperate to put its past behind it.""Jason Lives"" has got some great atmosphere going for it, and a rather slick look: gone is the grainy quality of the earlier entries. The kills are entertaining without being too gory, although the aftermath of a murder in a cabin has to be seen to be believed. DAMN, but that place is bloody! The pacing is excellent and the many entertaining sequences include a skewering of company ""war games"" and Tommy's frequent futile attempts to get a stubborn jerk sheriff (David Kagen) to believe him.An engaging cast includes Jennifer Cooke as an extremely feisty final girl, and a roster of victims such as Renee Jones, Kerry Noonan, Darcy DeMoss, and Tom Fridley. Tony Goldwyn, a few years before his breakthrough performance in ""Ghost"", got his SAG card on this show. The director's wife Nancy plays Lizbeth, and a hilarious Vincent Guastaferro is the macho deputy with the impressive gun.Harry Manfredinis' score is even better than usual, getting away from the more signature cues of the series, and as icing on the cake there are a few songs by rock legend Alice Cooper on the soundtrack: ""Teenage Frankenstein"", ""Hard Rock Summer"", and of course ""He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)"".Some F13 fans believe that this sequel signaled the beginning of the end, but speaking personally, I find it to be a lot of fun and don't mind a bit when filmmakers play around with the formula.Then again, some folks do have a strange idea of entertainment.Eight out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
16,preppy-3,"A different ""Friday"" movie",7,6 August 2006,"This movie starts off by throwing continuity straight out the window. According to the last movie Tommy Jarvis is now Jason and the REAL Jason was killed and cremated. This one starts on a dark and rainy night. Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) (he's NOT Jason now) is driving to Jason's grave (guess Jason wasn't cremated either) to make sure Jason is dead. He has a friend along (played by Ron Pallio). He opens the grave, accidentally revives Jason (don't ask) and Jason is up and about. Camp Crystal Lake is now Lake Forest Green and a new summer camp is about to open (since Jason is dead). Tommy tries to tell the police Jason is alive and well...but they don't believe him. And Jason is walking right to the lake where a whole bunch of little kids have just started summer camp...A real strange sequel. For starters the infamous music is NOT used until the end (and updated at that). Also this doesn't take itself seriously at all--it has an intentional sense of humor and--to be honest--some of it is very funny. I love the James Bond parody right before the opening credits. Also there are in jokes galore--there's a Cunningham Road, a town called Carpenter and Karloff's General Store! Also the kids in the summer camp are never really in danger and joke about it too (One kid thinks they're going to die and casually asks another, ""So--what did you want to be when you grew up?"") It actually works but this IS supposed to be a horror film.Palillo's opening murder is nice and gory and there are a few decent bits of gore here and there but (compared to the previous movies) this is pretty restrained. A triple decapitation isn't even shown! The original print had a lot more blood and gore but the MPAA REALLY clamped down on this one and most of the violence was edited out to get an R rating. The body count is still pretty high though--11 men, 6 women. The acting is pretty bad (as always). Mathews and Palillo are pretty good but everybody else is lousy. And, as always, Jason somehow manages to appear in these places that is was impossible for him to get to. I got a good laugh when he somehow manages to get into a tiny bathroom inside an RV to kill somebody! And we get a bunch of idiots doing some training where they shot each other with paint. They have no purpose in the movie other than to be killed.This is really not bad. It's not as stupid as the others and the humor works pretty well. No masterpiece but one of the better ""Friday the 13th"" sequels. I give it a 7.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
17,utgard14,"""I've seen enough horror movies to tell that any man wearing a mask is never friendly.""",7,12 April 2014,"This one doesn't get a lot of respect but it's one of my favorites. I love the opening scene where Jason is resurrected. It reminds me of the opening to Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, where the two grave robbers inadvertently resurrect the Wolf Man. I also love the Alice Cooper song ""He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)."" Very '80s and very cool. I know many fans don't like it much because they say it's watered down. But it adds a lot to what was a very repetitive series. It embraces the absurdity of the story and has fun with it, injecting a much-needed sense of humor into the series. Thom Matthews of Return of the Living Dead fame replaces dull John Shepherd as Tommy. Matthews is great. C.J. Graham is the guy playing Jason this time. I have to say as far as physical build and presence, he is the perfect Jason to me. Kane Hodder and his professional wrestler build I never liked. Also it's got Horshack in it and he has his heart punched out -- that's solid gold right there. This is an excellent Friday the 13th movie and just behind 1 & 4 for being the best.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

19,Boba_Fett1138,Jason's silly rampage continues.,5,30 October 2009,"It's amazing the stuff they think they can get away with. ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" is again a sequel with little story to it, even though it tries to bring in some originality again by changing the settings and of the movie and don't just restrain it to one location.For this movie Jason makes his reappearance again, after his absence from the previous movie as the movie its main killer. In this movie he's more monstrous than ever before and also his killers are perhaps more brutal than ever. His portrayal and appearance are great, though it still is a weird fact how randomly he always picks his victims in the movies. It has nothing to do with revenge anymore, as was still the case with at least the first two entries of the series. Now he's just killing for fun and it doesn't matter how old you are, what you do or how you look, you're just death when Jason is around. Horror-wise this just doesn't work out as anything to tense or scary.This movie sort of continues on the same trend as the previous sequels. It doesn't care about its story really and they think it's more than enough to simply put in as much killings as possible, unfortunately also again with some lame attempts at humor added to it. There is of course far more needed to make a good and above all also original horror movie with. Within its franchise but also within its genre ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" that adds little and doesn't impress much on any fronts, though its gore and effects are all being quite good to watch.It's also silly how the Friday the 13th series always seems to ruin its own potential. This is the second time already that they let the Tommy Jarvis character go to watch. In the previous two sequels within the series it was already implied that Tommy was going to be the next psychopathic killer but every time when a new sequel gets released he's being the good guy again, as if nothing had ever happened at the end of the previous movies, in which it showed Tommy as an evil character. It really goes at the expense of the continuity of the series, especially when you're watching the movies back-to-back.The movie doesn't even really try to be a great one. It simply seems to accept the fact that it isn't being renewing or original within its genre or even within its series of Friday the 13th movies and tries to compensate this by simply putting some graphic and brutal killings by the still greatly portrayed horror icon Jason Voorhees. 5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"What *were* you gonna be, when you grew up?",6,21 January 2011,"Tommy(recast, as the other guy became born-again, opting for a mass-murderer of higher reputation, Yahwe... and the new dude has an amusing accent, and broods a little) isn't certain that the ol' goalie is really dead(in fact, Jason Lives, as the title puts it... ""for no readily apparent reason"", as the headline of a newspaper review from back then added, *hilarious*), so he goes to dig him up, accidentally bringing him back to life(I hate when that happens). The camp(that actually has children now) is opening again, and guess where the now reanimated killer of now superhuman strength is headed? Ah, but this time, Jarvis Junior is on his trail, and he has a plan to take him down for good. Finally we have actual plot in this series, and it really makes a difference. The nemesis kind of thing going on, while our hero is held back by clichéd occurrences, raises this above the others where you're just watching the body-count go up. This doesn't have stalking, and we see the badass butcher the most out of any of these up to this point, yet he remains terrifying... he's like nitroglycerin, unstable and you don't know when he'll explode. He has no trouble taking out people and goes through them like a hot knife... butter... yeah, you know what I mean. The death scenes are memorable if not necessarily creative, and there's hardly any gore(some violence, and lots of blood... there isn't nudity either, if one sex scene), you usually merely see the wound afterwards. No, it tends to be sound effects and the performances that sells it. There aren't many FX. The pacing isn't bad, and we get a creepy opening and a cool and different climax. This is 80 minutes sans credits, and it's entertaining throughout. The humor has its moments, when it isn't intolerably silly and/or trying way too hard. Characters and acting are OK. The editing and filming is the best yet, with some downright nice sequences. This and the 3rd are the ones worth the time investment of the ones I've seen so far. The DVD comes with a cool theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise and of slasher flicks in general. 6/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
21,view_and_review,Reanimated Jason,1,8 August 2019,"I read that this movie was filmed in 40 days. I'm surprised it was more than 4 days.The movie started off all wrong. Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews)--remember Tommy? That would have been Corey Feldman in part four. He hacked Jason to death. And in part five he was a wack job because of his Jason encounter. That same Tommy now in part six is so obsessed with Jason that he goes to Forest Green (formerly Crystal Lake) to dig up Jason, presumably to verify he's dead and buried. OK. If that's not strange enough, after he digs up Jason and sees the maggot filled decomposed body he rips an iron stake from the broken down fence and stabs the corpse. And if that's not strange enough, lightning strikes and reanimates Jason. WTF!Now Jason is a zombie with the same bloodlust and super strength. The lengths that some will go to revive a franchise. No brains required just a child's imagination.Jason then parades through the crowded Forest Green Lake area killing at will. Tommy, now actually having a real concern since Jason is back, goes to the sheriff to warn him. The sheriff doesn't believe him but the sheriff's daughter thinks he's cute so she'll help him in his endeavor because that's what cuteness does. It makes stupid girls stupider.Maybe it's unfair for me to call her stupid just because her actions didn't make sense. She was sarcastic, she was disobedient, she was reckless, she was hot to trot, but that doesn't mean she was stupid. One thing she was for sure was lucky--I have no idea how she survived.Tommy had the chance to flee Forest Green and watch all the carnage on the evening news, but Tommy felt a sense of responsibility. So what did Tommy do? He went to a bookstore. Yes, he went to a bookstore and bought books such as ""30 Years Among the Dead,"" ""The Dead are Alive,"" and ""A Manual of Occultism"" because now is the time to curl up by the fire and read a good book.We get it. He needed to know how to kill a zombie. And we are to believe that Mr. Speed reader read one, or all of those books before the night was over. He must have because in only an hour or more he had the answer of how to defeat Jason. Maybe these were picture books.At any rate, Tommy's horrible plan worked. Well, not really but what does it matter anyway? Whatever Tommy did will be undone in the next part of the franchise probably by Tommy himself.This movie was awful. It didn't need to be made.Final kill tally: 17, very nearly 18 because I nearly gouged my eyes out.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
22,evanston_dad,"Don't Make Fun of Yourself, Jason -- That's My Job",1,17 October 2007,"Halfway through this woeful installment in the ""Friday the 13th"" series, a grave digger, who's discovered that the grave of Jason Voorhees has been dug up (by none other than Tommy Jarvis, being played by yet a third actor), looks squarely at the camera and says, ""Some people have a strange idea of entertainment."" Thus, this ""Friday"" movie is doomed by a self-referential sense of humor that decides to make a sort of action hero out of Jason. In the opening credits, he walks out James Bond style on the screen and whirls his machete like a gunslinger twirling a pistol. Tee hee, isn't that funny? These movies are horrible, but I've always derived a level of satisfaction from making fun of them. So if they start making fun of themselves and take even that morsel of entertainment value away from me, what's left? This episode doesn't even include one gratuitous nude scene, and gore hounds will be sorely disappointed at how un-gory the whole thing is.

Graham) is not only dead and buried but that he will never return to kill and terrorize innocent people again. So one dark and stormy night he and his friend ""Allen Hawes"" (Ron Palillo) escape from their mental hospital and drive to the cemetery where Jason is buried with the intent on exhuming the body and then burning it to ashes. Unfortunately, Tommy gets a bit carried away upon seeing the body and after driving a metal rod through Jason's chest causes a bolt of lightning to strike it-returning Jason back to life! Although Tommy manages to escape his friend is not so lucky and from that point on Jason has only one thought in mind-to return to what was formerly called ""Camp Crystal Lake"" to continue his reign of death and destruction to a new group of counselors who had long thought that he was dead. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this film was slightly better than its predecessor due in large part to the plentiful action scenes and some traces of humor here and there. Admittedly, I had hoped for a bit more suspense but all things considered I was reasonably satisfied with the film and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the best entries in the series,9,27 October 2015,"Attempting to disprove the Jason legend, Tommy Jarvis inadvertently revives him and sets him out to continue his rampage against a group of clueless teens preparing a summer camp session and forces him to try to stop him.Frankly this one was one of the most underrated efforts in the series. One of the better qualities here is the high amount of action found throughout here, which not only gives this one an unbelievably exciting pace but gives this so much to like. Starting off with the fantastic opening sequence where Jason's resurrection in the cemetery with the grand Gothic action of the metal rod and the lightning bolt, the attack on the campers on the shortcut in the woods and the car-chase through the woods leading the police back to the graveyard all manage to give this some highly exciting scenes along the way here. Other fine action scenes here include the camper attack where he takes out the couple in their RV before a fantastic crash along the highway, a second fairly exciting car chase with the police that also manages some fine humorous moments as well, and the final battle at the lake is one of the better confrontations in the series not only for doing the gender switch of the guy rather than the girl but the brawling on the boat and getting dragged down to the bottom requiring intervention anyway makes this a lot of fun and only adds to the action. That's not just for the rather enjoyable slasher moments here, as those makes this one even better by featuring some great parts here with him stalking the group of paint- ball players in the woods, the attack on the campers in their cabins as he picks them off in some really chilling scenes where they have to keep the safety of the children accounted for as the discovery of the bodies is made, and the wiping out of the police force at the camp makes for a series of great kills as the numerous bodies pile up rather quickly, allowing for some truly fun stalking scenes as well. The after-affect here of all this is that there's such a great body-count of dozens of deaths here and it's filled with some clever, unique kills here. While also packed with some fine humorous moments and a fun, striking-looking Jason, there's enough to like here that makes this one enjoyable to be able to hold off the one big flaw in this one. What really causes this one to come down somewhat is the rather lame plot here of the police to be wrong throughout here merely to be shown up later because Tommy has to be proved right, which really flies in the face of true police behavior. Almost all of their encounters here are meant to have him be right at the expense of the rational way most police conduct their business, especially at the beginning as the sort of story told should warrant an investigation into the claims rather than throw him in jail and then hold that over him the entire rest of the film. It's a little troubling, but it's the only flaw here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, a brief sex scene and some drug use.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

This proves to be a disastrous mistake, as a sudden storm generates a bolt of lightning that revives Jason's corpse, and, after killing Tommy's friend, returns to Camp Crystal Lake to resume his murderous ways, where(of course) lots of people(from weekend warriors to summer camp counselors) await.Series went full-on supernatural in this one, as now Jason is an undead monster who can't be killed by normal means, and Tommy desperately tries to convince police that he isn't insane. Lots of humor in this one, which only cheapens an already shaky premise into self-parody, though there is at least the appropriate song ""He's Back"" playing at the end.

26,FlashCallahan,I'll order up some body bags........,7,30 November 2015,"It's been two films since Tommy Jarvis killed Jason Voorhees, but the intensity of the experience has landed him in a mental institution. To end his torment, Tommy escapes from the hospital and heads to the graveyard where Jason is buried, intending to dig up the body and cremate it. But, before this occurs, a freak electrical accident resurrects Jason from the dead, and the terror begins again............There are two types of people in the world. Those who prefer the movies before part V, and those who prefer the absurdest, bonkers sequels that were parts VI to VIII. I fall into the latter camp, and although I think there are some fascinating elements to the first four movies, they are way too serious considering the subject and the character of Jason.Understandably, there are very few people who prefer the later movies to the first four, but this is when the makers decided to forget plausibility, to forget the fact that Jason is still killing for his mother, and instead go for laughs, go for nudity, and most importantly, go for some wonderful kills.It all starts off seriously enough, with poor Tommy trying to end his mental torture by completely vaporising Jason from the face of the earth. Then Jason gets struck by lightning, and he does some weird James Bond barrel walk, and it just gets better as the film becomes more self aware of the ridiculousness of it all.As stories go, it's nothing spectacular, Tommy resurrects Jason, and inadvertently becomes the prime suspect of all the killings, and from there on in, it's pretty much business as usual. The Sheriff doesn't believe a word he says right until it's too late, said Sheriff has a a daughter who falls for Tommy, and there are a bunch of kids who are getting up to a bit of cheeky cheeky, who really shouldn't be, because you know what?Jason doesn't care for any of it, or anyone.There are certain points in the film where if Jason had a voice, he would says some cracking one liners ala Krueger, for example, the scene where the guy shoots him with the paint-ball gun. Jason just looks down and then looks at the poor guy as if to say 'Really?', these are parts of the film that make this franchise arguably the best horror franchise of the eighties.And the funniest part if the film, the part that makes it one of the best sequels in the franchise, is the scene where the Sheriffs daughter tells the children to get under the bed, and it looks like someone is just throwing mannequins on the floor.It's censored within an inch of its life, but it only adds to the enjoyment of a wonderfully bonkers film.A must for fans of eighties horror.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
27,Aaron1375,Jason returns and really piles up the bodies.,7,5 March 2003,"This is one of my favorite Friday the 13th movies to watch.  This is probably because it has the most killings of any of the franchise.  In fact the first time I saw this one as a kid I made a joke that this one needed a counter to show every time someone was killed, like in the horror spoof ""Student Bodies"".  Tommy, who apparently killed Jason in 4, digs up Jason in an attempt to cremate his remains.  Let me say that it is best to ignore part 5 where it is mentioned that Jason has in fact already been cremated, best to just pretend 5 doesn't exist for the most part.  Lightening somehow revives Jason, and before Tommy can set him on fire it starts to rain...Darn!  Jason proceeds to mow down anybody he comes into contact with, and Tommy gets thrown in jail because no one believes his story of a walking corpse on a killing spree.  Is this a great movie...no, but it is rather fun to watch if not taken too seriously.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
28,Wuchakk,"Jason lives again as a horrific zombie, plus Megan (Jennifer Cooke)",7,9 August 2014,"Released in 1986, ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" is notable for being the premiere of the zombie Jason as his rotting corpse is resurrected in the prologue indirectly through the actions of Tommy Jarvis and a friend who recently got out of a mental institution. This prologue also shows that Tommy didn't murder Pam at the end of Part V and that he was simply experiencing hallucinations from his trauma with the diabolic Voorhees spirit. Another difference with Part VI is that we finally get to see a busload of kids, children, at Crystal Lake, although they changed the name to Forest Green. Tommy runs to the local police to inform them that Jason has been resurrected but the sheriff, of course, doesn't believe him (would you?). His hot daughter, Megan, is attracted to Tommy and, when the bloody body count rises, the sheriff realizes that Jason is indeed alive.Tommy Jarvis is played by Thom Mathews rather than John Shepherd, who was excellent in Part V. Thom is a worthy replacement, but I prefer Shepherd's brooding charisma.The film features one of the best Friday girls in Megan, played by Jennifer Cooke, although Pam from the previous film is my favorite. Other than that, though, the females in Part VI are rather weak, although the redhead in the Volkswagen is notable (Nancy McLoughlin).The campiness of Part III and Part V returns for this installment, particularly with the goofy paintball warriors and the graveyard caretaker. But ""Jason Lives"" is noticeably superior to Part III and shares the kinetic vibe of Part V.As far as locations go, Part VI returns to the East for filming, being shot roughly 40 miles East of Atlanta in Covington & Rutledge .BOTTOM LINE: You either like the Friday the 13th series or you don't. Part VI is another retread of the same Friday formula with the entertaining spirit of Part V and the distinction of Jason now being totally inhuman, a horrific zombie; not to mention the addition of children at the camp. It also has a better story than parts III and IV with the sheriff and his daughter & Tommy going after Jason, plus Megan is one of the top Friday girls in the series.The film runs 91 minutes and the cut version 86 minutes.GRADE: B/B-",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

The aren't bad but still, there is much better. But I notice that I'm always opening with that statement. Again, it starts of pretty well with the resurrection of Jason Voorhees but once he's out there and he starts to kill you could tell, again, where's the red stuff. Again, killings are done off-camera. The story is going more and more away from the Crystal Lake storyline and Jason is more and more a monster with supernatural powers. Another thing that was left out is the nudity, one of the things that most of the fans require in a Friday flick. Again, if you watch it on his own it could pass the mine of horror but into the franchise it's getting worser and worser but still, people came watching the series. The music here is mostly from Alice Cooper. I still can remember that I bought the album (CD's weren't yet invented!)but hearing it know it is also a bit out of date.

In this one, Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) goes to the graveyard to get rid of Jason Voorhees' body, but instead, inadvertently resurrects him by exposing the body to lightening. Now, its another fight to eliminate Jason (C.J.

The thrills, screams, gore and action continue with this film, and the actors, though campy and amateurish at times, still delivered in the film.The series is not on par with the likes of the Halloween or Hitchcock movies, and the cheese factor does show, but it is still entertaining in its fast-paced plot and hair-raising scenes.Grade B-",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
34,thesar-2,See What You've Been Missing...finally,9,18 January 2009,"Ah, my favorite 'Friday the 13th' film, 'Part VI: Jason Lives.' This horror/comedy works on so many levels. From the excellent opening, with the return of Jason's nemesis Tommy digging up Jason's corpse to ensure his demise, to the James Bond spoof credit scene, the movie starts with a bang. Yes, even the lightening that inadvertently brings Jason back is a good show  it flat out tells us what were in for: a horror spoof that not only spoofs the previous 'Friday' films, but never once takes itself seriously. I love that in films: ones that can acknowledge their own faults and refuse to take themselves at word. Including and after the opening, they get right to the point. All previous 'Friday' movies made us wait until the final 20 minutes or less to actually see the killer. Here, finally, we get to see Jason throughout. And he's in full force, now technically a monster with great strength and no hiding that he really can't be killed. That's part of the evidence 'Jason Lives' doesn't take itself too seriously; they know it's a sixth entry in a horror series and they know we all know what to expect, including Jason doesn't seem to die  so why hide it? The movie has an excellent, ah hem, killer soundtrack, including Alice Cooper ('He's Back' is one of my all time favorite Cooper songs), funny dialogue and scenes (anyone wanna play paintball?), actual tense, scary and creative scenes/kills despite its comedic tone throughout, decent acting and finally, 'Friday' brings the young kids to camp  something many previous installments only talked about.

A group of kids goes into the woods near Crystal Lake. One by one, they're butchered by an undead madman named Jason. Roll credits. That's pretty much the entire movie. Wake me when it's over.Actually, this Friday sequel is a little better than most. While the plot ideas are nothing new, Director/Screenwriter Tom McLoughlin attempts to bring a level of intelligence to the proceedings. Some of the dialogue is at least witty. It might have been interesting to see what he would have done with the series had he been brought on earlier before the concept became so tired.The acting is nothing spectacular. In fact, I can't remember anyone who stood out. The special effects are the highlight of the movie. The opening scene in the graveyard with the maggot covered Jason is quite good. The film suffers tremendously from MPAA cuts. Most of the effects are shown only in very brief glances.In short, Part VI is far from worst of the series, but it certainly isn't the best.EDIT 10/30/17 - I just rewatched Part VI and realize I missed the mark the first time through. I originally watched it as a serious episode - like all the rest. I had never considered looking at this installment as a comedy. If you look at it like that, Part Vi really works. I said it was intelligent, but it's also very cleverly written. Some of the scenes are a real hoot. One I especially enjoyed is the scene where Jason is outside the cabin mimicking or tracking the girl's movements through the cabin. Very nice stuff. I also failed to recognize just how good Thom Mathews and the rest of the cast really is. It might be one of the better acted films in the series. After my rewatch, I also think it might be one of the better entries in the series. I'm changing the rating to a 7/10.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

In the first part, the film often approaches the style of a slapstick comedy! I've never been a fan of the early ""Friday"" entries (especially of the terrible ""Final Chapter""), so I had no trouble in enjoying those moments. But eventually the usual monotony sets in, the killings are standard and the movie becomes tediously repetitive.

37,Robert_duder,"Back in action, and supernatural from here on in",7,18 August 2011,"Friday the 13th Part Six Jason Lives is important because this is the turning point when Jason finally becomes a beyond the grave terrifying monster with practically supernatural powers. As the latest Tommy Jarvis states ""He's back and stronger than ever."" You actually do notice a difference between Jason Voorhees #2-4 and the Jason of Part six and that's significant. His strength is terrifying and brutal and makes his kills a little less original but far more brutal. The film makers actually try and explain why and how he's returning this time and even sort of where this new brutal Voorhees gets his strength from. I also think this is one of the better endings to the films. Instead of killing this creature which after six films, and multiple years you'd think someone would think of an alternative. While finally Tommy Jarvis does, however short-lived his solution may be.Thom Mathews takes over the role for the third and final time as Tommy Jarvis. Mathews is good, much better than John Shepherd in A New Beginning was but still not as good as Corey Feldman in Final Chapter. Mathews is stronger in the role, and more leading man quality but still doesn't quite fit the bill. Jennifer Cooke is our scream queen this time around and she is quite good in the role. She's the defiant Sheriff's daughter, and she has a sexy spark to her character. I mean given they don't give her a lot of depth but she does well with what she's given. David Kagen is also good as her father and the local Sheriff. I think he comes across as a little bit campy from time to time but in a film like this that always works. And then of course you have your host of victims each with a little bit of personality but nothing that will ever catch your eye. Jason Voorhees this time around is played by C.J. Graham, his only acting credit besides one other film. He probably had a blast playing Jason this time around with his brute strength and new found post-dead persona.Tom McLoughlin takes the helm of directing and co-writing this instalment and its worth mentioning that he went on to direct the Friday the 13th TV Series as well (though it had nothing to do with the film series.) McLoughlin clearly appreciates the series and wants to it justice. For me the opening scene of this instalment was one of the most memorable. I remember seeing it as a kid at my Grandparents place but that wasn't allowed to see the rest. And as I said the ending I thought was at least unique and led easily into the next film which some consider the worst of the series but I whole heartedly disagree. This is a must in the series of course and gives almost a reboot to the character. 7/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
38,bowmanblue,My favourite Friday,8,17 August 2014,"Not everyone would agree with me that this is the best of the (bad!) bunch, but then I'm a sucker for putting a little humour into these sorts of films. Yes, the psychotic killer – Jason Voorhees – is finally back after the misfire of a film that was Part 5... and he's now undead. This means that he's more of the 'Jason' we know and love.However, the film-makers have gone for a more 'tongue in cheek' style to the film. I enjoyed it. Even though I enjoy the whole Friday 13th franchise, I have to admit that I think it's a little daft and ripe for adding a few black comedy moments. 'Part 6' continues the tale of Tommy Jarvis (survivor of parts 4 and 5) and he's back to take on Jason (even if he is sporting a third face!). Now it's sort of like 'Scream' in that it's a lot more 'knowing' and parodies itself. Plus it has less characters than Part 5 (which had waaay too many) so it can concentrate on the important ones.Yes, the same 'if you have sex you die' rule still applies, but the kills are more imaginative than they have been before (especially in parts 1-4) and the humour also shines through in that. I enjoyed it, yet a lot of people still disagreed with me.Basically, if you don't mind black comedy mixed with horror then you should enjoy this. However, if you think horror should be played straight, or that they should have kept the Friday 13th franchise as dark as parts 1-5 then you might want to skip this one and go straight to chapter 7.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
39,ericstevenson,At least it's not terrible,6,14 October 2016,"This entry in the series actually started off pretty well. It seemed the movie was taking shots at itself with the one guy looking at the camera and blaming the audience for considering this entertainment. A girl says that she knows that those wearing masks in horror movies are not friendly. I heard that this might have been trying to be a self parody of the series. By the second half, it just abandons it. We get the same scenes of the kills over and over and it's rarely interesting. I will at least give this film credit for somewhat trying to be a good movie. The makeup is quite impressive. I really do like Tommy Jarvis here as it's interesting for a series with so few recurring characters to have a protagonist.It seriously probably is the second best movie in the series next to the original. It does kind of set up the mythology well. What fails is that it doesn't make any sense. In the previous movie, it was said that Jason's body was already cremated, but here it isn't. Maybe that's more the fault of the previous movie, which really is worse. There have actually been three serial killers at Camp Crystal Lake (or Forest Green) at this point and it's simply stupid that they would try to suppress information on it. He's not Freddy Krueger. He doesn't become stronger the more you believe in him. Speaking of which, there's actually a girl here named Nancy who has a bad dream. Maybe it's the same Nancy from the Nightmare movies? I guess if you're really bored you can check this one out. This is a fan favorite and I really can see why. **",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

That doesn't mean it's a good movie. It's not. But Jason Lives is entertaining. This campy horror flick seems to be in on the joke about what it is. It also gives us an actual story and characters that are more than just machete fodder.

41,CuriosityKilledShawn,An overrated return,6,13 April 1999,"After suffering a horrible low with one of THE absolute worst films ever made in Part V: A New Beginning, the Friday the 13th series bounced back with Jason Lives. Writer/Director Tom McLoughlin brought energy and wit that few other filmmakers have bothered (or had the ability) to bring to the long-running series. Paramount wanted the slate wiped clean and McLoughlin effectively reboots the series while mostly retconning Part V out of existence. I always make a point of going straight from The Final Chapter to Jason Lives. Part V doesn't exist to me.After killing off the hockey-masked maniac, Tommy Jarvis is now all grown up but suffers from nightmares and visions of Jason. Determined to put an end to it he locates Jason's grave, digs it up to check that he's really there, and vents his frustration by stabbing him with a metal spike. If he had done this at any other time than the stroke of midnight on Thursday the 12th then perhaps an ill-timed bolt of lightning would not have revived Jason, now a rotting zombie with superhuman powers (the quintessential Jason, let's say).Now Jason goes on a killing spree.And there's your plot.Jason Lives is a fan favorite, and while I can appreciate the technical improvements and the better acting, the movie really does have a weak script that rushes through the important parts while lingering on tedious ""tension"" as characters stumble about in the dark. One of the main faults with this entire series is that about 90% of the characters never know that they are in danger until the split second before Jason eviscerates them. Can you imagine if the crew of the Nostromo never knew there was an 8-foot Alien stalking them? A scene where Tommy learns how to properly kill Jason is over in about ten seconds. He apparently finds books on the occult...at what seems to be a run-down and abandoned gas station. It's so stupid. The movie was also made during that annoying 80s/90s phase where horror directors reference each other for laughs. I hate that. However, this self-aware edge is seemingly what gave Kevin Williamson his inspiration to created Scream.What Jason Lives has in its favor is the classic horror atmosphere. Had it been shot in black & white then it would look no different to the old Universal horror movies with Frankenstein and Dracula. But even that is squandered with the all too familiar location of Camp Crystal Lake. McLoughlin should have given us new locations and embraced the supernatural elements of his idea instead of treading the same ground that five movies before him did.It's a very popular with horror enthusiasts though (even though it was one of the lowest grossing of the series, so figure that one out) and I'd like to see Tom McLoughlin come back to have another stab at it. This franchise and iconic character has unlimited possibilities but everyone seems to keep doing the same old/same old routine and never taking any chances.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

43,Bored_Dragon,"So, what WERE you gonna be when you grow up?",5,19 July 2018,"This is ridiculous. Lightning strikes already decayed Jason's body, which has been eaten by maggots for quite some time, and he rises from the grave to start a new killing spree. The premise itself has killed my will to watch this movie. Although pretty stupid, the franchise used to be somewhat realistic. What we see on the screen could really happen to anyone and that made this franchise scary. The moment already stupid story becomes also impossible to really happen, it stops being tense and frightening. In addition, there is no nudity and bunch of scenes look like they have been taken from a bad comedy, all of which makes ""Jason Lives"" one of the weaker parts of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. The only good things in this movie are the music of the legendary Alice Cooper and, although it mostly repeats what was already seen in the prequels, it also brings a couple of original ideas.5/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

46,paulclaassen,Spoof or slapstick comedy??,1,15 October 2021,"Having disappointed fans of the series with 'Friday the 13th 5: A New Beginning' where Jason was absent, they decided to bring him back for another round of killings. However, the damage has been done. At the time, the film earned the lowest box office takings in the franchise, proving fans had enough.Tommy is back again, this time played by Thom Mathews. With Jason having been buried, Tommy is adamant to send him ""to hell"", by digging him up and setting his corpse alight. Or that's the plan anyway. Jason's resurrection scene is really great - like a Frankenstein movie, and the best visual effects yet in the series. Jason is now officially non-human, having been brought back from the dead.Camp Crystal Lake is now called Camp Forest Green. The town changed the name in an effort to bring campers back again (just like the creators made an effort to bring back their fans...). There's unfortunately so much silly humor here, it felt like a horror comedy. 'A New Beginning' had lots of humor, but 'Jason Lives' is just laden with humor. At one point I wondered whether this was an actual sequel or a spoof. Even the kill scenes were funny instead of scary. There's no suspense here - just slapstick humor and unconvincing acting.Pardon my French, but this film was fu*king stupid! It suffers from bad dialogue, idiotic characters, and moments that should have ended up on the cutting room floor. I mean, I was literally so annoyed by how utterly stupid this was, that I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. This was hardly watchable. And if I wanted slapstick, I'd have watched a silly comedy, NOT a horror franchise installment...",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
47,tomgillespie2002,The first time I've truly enjoyed a Friday the 13th movie,5,31 January 2015,"Following the backlash from fans at the previous instalment's omission of Jason Voorhees as the killer and the general awfulness of the film as a whole, the series took a new direction thanks to the efforts of director and writer Tom McLoughlin. Jason Lives is the first time Jason has been recognised as a supernatural force (which would explain his refusal to die after being disposed of in a manner of gruesome ways previously) and one of the earliest examples (perhaps the first example?) of a horror movie being so humorously self-reflexive, long before the post-modern horror boom in the 1990's following the success of Scream (1996).A year after A New Beginning (1985), Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) and a friend drive to Jason's grave in the hope of burning the body to rid Tommy of his recurring nightmares. When Jason's rotting corpse is uncovered, Tommy loses it and repeatedly stabs and kicks the lifeless monster. Inexplicably, a lightning bolt hits Jason, reanimating him into an unstoppable killing machine. After his friend is killed, Tommy flees to Forest Green, re-named from Crystal Lake to try and rid the town of the stigma of Jason's previous killing spree's. Believing Tommy to be a psychopathic loon after he breaks into the sheriff's office making wild claims, Sheriff Garris (David Kagen) imprisons him. But his daughter Megan (Jennifer Cooke), believes him and decides to take matters into her own hands.Despite treading very familiar ground to the movies that came before - the film is again little more than an endless series of disposable characters being cut to bloody pieces - Jason Lives is the best in the series thanks to McLoughlin's obvious talent for comedy. Even going as far as breaking the fourth wall, the characters talk as if they're aware they're in a horror film before being massacred, the best of which is three bickering corporate types on a paintball bonding activity having their heads lopped off in one swing. For once, we have a memorable hero thanks to Mathews' performance, repeating his lovable lug-head shtick from The Return of the Living Dead (1985). It's far from perfect, but it's the first time I've truly enjoyed a Friday the 13th movie.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

50,Fella_shibby,"A solid return of Jason, aft all he ain't that bad. He doesn't harm kids.",7,18 May 2020,"I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs.
Revisited it recently.
This one doesn't waste time in the flashbacks n starts where Tommy is seen driving hale n hearty outta the institution, to make sure that Jason is dead to stop his hallucinations.
But the start doesn't quite fit the ending shown in the previous 5th part.
Mayb the end of the previous part was a dream too.
Or mayb the events of the previous 5th part never happened n this is the continuation of the 4th part.
Or maybe we r supposed to ignore part 5 completely.
Whatever, but this one is a fast paced thriller, less gory, lots of body count n the only one with zero nudity.The opening scene of the misty lake, the woods n the cemetery with the thundering makes it a very creepy one n back to basic stuff.
So this is the part where Jason becomes immortal being n his first kill as a revenant demon is nasty.
An immortal revenant demon with gloves n a Rambo knife.
But according to the director of this part we r supposed to believe that Jason was always a supernatural force n we r supposed to dismissed the idea from part 2 that Jason survived the drowning.This one wants to compete with the double impalement scene n has a triple decapitation with a machete n another double impaling.
This one has car chases, gun shots n a cop who fights Jason but gets killed in Final Destination death style.The funny part is even aft becoming sortuva demon, Jason takes precautions in disconnecting the phone lines, unplugging the cords, hiding in a loo with a female's mouth shut. He also spares the kids. Now this is a welcome move.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
51,insomniac_rod,"The best ""Friday the 13th"" in the series and also a GOOD Horror movie.",9,30 August 2004,"Could that happen? Can a sequel of the infamous ""Friday the 13th movies"" be that good that it should be considered a decent horror movie? The answer is a surprising ""yes"". Watch it with minimal expectations, watch it without the ""Friday the 13th"" title and you could enjoy an entertaining horror movie. If you have seen other ""Jason movies"" and didn't like them, trust me, JASON LIVES could be the exception as it's not the typical slasher flick. There's black humor, violence, a good score, high quality direction, and a story (something that most slasher flicks lack of).***SPOILERS*** (PLOT, HIGHLIGHTS)**PLOT** Jason Voorhees returns to Camp Crystal Lake (now called Camp Forrest Green) after he is resurrected by accident by Tommy Jarvis, the boy that killed him years before. Jason's resurrection is spectacular, arguably, the best opening sequence in the series. Tommy Jarvis sticks a pole in Jason's corpse when suddenly a thunder strikes it, giving life to Jason by lightning. After raising from his grave, he takes and puts his hockey mask on, and heads his way to Camp Crystal Lake (now officially named Camp Forrest Green to ignore the events of Camp Blood). Tommy after watching Jason's resurrection goes to Sheriff Garrett's office looking for help but the Sheriff withdraws his version and recognizes him as the boy traumatized by Jason and resident of the mental institution.Tommy insists on his story but only ends incarcerated in the sheriff's office. Sheriff Garrett's daughter shows interest on Tommy and later helps him escape and get things in order to face Jason. Meanwhile Jason starts his killing spree and this time his victims are child counselors, plush a gravedigger, a horny couple, and a group of ultra geek explorers. After a series of events including the Sheriff and his officers' deaths and a massacre at Camp Forrest Green, Tommy with the aid of a book of the occult (where he learns that Jason has to be killed in the place where he originally died), chains, gasoline, and a boat; faces Jason in the middle of Crystal Lake. Finally Tommy manages to tie a huge rock with a chain to Jason's neck making him drown (once again)in the bottom of Crystal Lake. Jason chokes Tommy and believes he killed him, while he gets used to his underwater grave, tied to a rock.**HIGHLIGHTS** The opening scene is unique, it has great f/x, a creepy atmosphere, a scary environment, and black humor surrounding it. The James Bond spoof is excellent! it's stuff for legend. That's a touch of genius with a lot of black humor.The deaths are a bit of disappointing. Many fans of the series think about ""Jason Lives"" as the PG-13 Friday the 13th movie. There are still the well known Friday the 13th elements such as gore, sex, violence, sex related jokes, etc. but in a low tone. There are good death scenes like Elizabeth (stabbed in the face), Hawes (has his heart ripped!), Sheriff Garrett (gets his back broken), and Cort (stabbed in the temple) among others. Jason's death in this movie is very well done. The whole scene with the lake in flames, the scared children watching, Megan watching how she could help, Tommy fighting Jason in the middle of the lake; is one of the best elaborated scenes in the whole series. Jason's death should please fans of the series, as Jason is defeated not that easily as in part 2, 3, The Final Chapter, Thew New Blood, and Jason Takes Manhattan.What I love about JASON LIVES is the clever black humor that surrounds it. There's spoof of other movies where everything surrounds the main character (Frankenstein, 007, Evil Dead), it also spoofs horror clichés in a delightful way. JASON LIVES stands alone in the ""Friday the 13th"" series because it has elements that are nowhere to be found in the other movies. For example this is the only movie where there's black humor, not explicit death scenes, scary moments, the tense music often used in the series, and an interesting and well crafted story that supports the events. The acting is great for a slasher movie. Thom Mathews (from Return Of The Living Dead fame) delivers an insane and mature performance as the haunted and obsessed with Jason Tommy Jarvis. His performance is believable. What can I say about Megan? (Jennifer Cooke) I think she's the best lead female in the series. She's super hot, sexy, tender, and also brave. She's not the typical Friday the 13th lead female. She even knocks off Jason in the final scene. Great actress, I wonder why she didn't continue in the genre.The other cast members are very good; you can't get much better acting in other slasher movies. The score is great! totally new stuff in the series. You still got the trademark ""ki ki ki ma ma ma"" plush a very 80's metal soundtrack, and a great score specially made for the movie. A score that good that was used by ""The New Blood"" and ""House II"".Director Tom McLoughin did a great job by giving this touch of quality to the ""Friday the 13th"" series. He did a quality horror movie that stands alone from HUNDREDS of 80's cheesiness in horror.JASON LIVES is not a simple slasher movie, it's a horror movie with a story to support it. In other words it's a good horror movie. Probably the best in the series and one of the best horror movies with black comedy. Believe it or not, even with the ""Friday the 13th part VI"" title it's a good horror movie that totally deserves a watch by any horror fan.10/10 in the Friday the 13th scale.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
52,Anonymous_Maxine,Every installment gets worse than the last one. Except this one.,8,8 February 2005,"The movie starts off fairly well, relatively speaking. Tommy Jarvis has grown up into a young man and returns to Jason's grave, unable to go on living unless he can completely verify for himself that Jason is really dead. On the other hand, digging up Jason's grave and essentially freeing him (since Tommy doesn't believe that Jason can be killed) doesn't exactly strike me as the best course of action. What was he planning to do, collect Jason's teeth and go check his dental records? At any rate, at least there is some thought put into an interesting way to bring Jason back to life, at least long enough to kill enough kids to fill up another movie.Tommy digs Jason up and then stabs his decayed corpse with a nearby fencepost, which is promptly struck by lightning thus bringing Jason back to life. It was earlier in this scene in the movie that someone utters the line, ""Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment,"" which I had planned on using as the summary line in my review. Sadly, I logged on to the IMDb and the first thing I noticed was that I was not as clever as I thought. It is, after all, one of the best lines in the movie, since it is such a tongue in cheek jab at the movie's biggest fans.During the paintball scene that soon follows, I was immediately struck by the intelligence of the characters. I really appreciate that this movie has people in it who are boneheads but they're not stupid. These are regular guys with undeveloped intellects rather than the typical horror movie moron, one of the worst things to ever see in a horror film. Or any other film, for that matter. It is a great scene when Jason gets his hands on a machete, for example. One of the boneheads in the movie, Burt, is shot by a woman during the paintball game, after which he proceeds to hack away at the trees around him, and check this out. He curses to himself that she shouldn't have been out there in the first place, she should have stayed where she belonged (presumably the kitchen), etc. This is a development of his character as well as the revelation of a deep character flaw that allows the audience to enjoy his death even after learning something about who he is. When was someone invented as fodder ever given that depth of character? Never!Sure, we hardly learn about his childhood and his dreams, but the point is that he ceases to be nothing but some poor sucker to get hacked up in a creative way by Jason. Then you have the other guy who loses his gun. Again, a lesser horror film would have had him lose his gun through some monumental act of paralyzing stupidity. In this film, he's just an office geek who isn't used to handling guns. He thinks he's in a warzone but he is just out of his element, and Jason is closing in to remind him of where he belongs. These are some of the best characters ever put into the Friday the 13th series.Granted, the movie does have its share of lame goofiness. The cemetery man (that's a good movie, too), for example, at the beginning responds to Tommy's request to dig up Jason with something like, ""Dig him up? Does he think I'm a farthead?! Huh huh huh!"" but the characters clearly have the most depth and meaning that we have seen in the series so far. The dumbest characters in the movie are the cops, which I'm sure has some sort of hidden message (which Hitchcock would have appreciated, no doubt), and there is also a clever scene involving the TV. One of the kids staying at the camp (oh, I forgot to tell you, they've changed the charming name of Camp Blood so that they can operate as a summer camp) one night swears that she saw a monster. The counselors tell her that it's okay, it was just a bad dream, but she insists that it was real, ""just like TV."" Hear that, parents? Don't let your kids watch too much TV or they'll grow up and watch movies like this!Besides that, the little girl's name was Nancy. Could this be an homage to Nightmare on Elm Street?There is an interesting plot structure that involves the police thinking that Tommy is doing the killing, which ties in neatly with their status as the dumbest guys in the movie. This is leaps and bounds better than the sequels that preceded it (and light years better than Part VIII!!), there's even some good direction. The shot of Jason standing on top of the burning motor-home is one of the best shots thus far in the series. If you're going to watch some Friday the 13th movies, definitely don't miss this one. It's easy to get tired of the same old thing by this point, but this one is worth skipping ahead to see.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Although there is an overall story, the middle of the film, and the bulk of Jason's kills take the form of short vignettes, introducing a character, or characters, before having Jason eliminate them. Some of these are intentionally funny, in fact, there's a knowing sense of humour that permeates the whole film, such as in the James Bond parody at the beginning, or the two boys calmly accepting their fate.Whilst I do think that the film was a stage above some of the films featured on the ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast, I would never go as far as describing this as a ""good"" film. There is some ropey acting and some questionable motivations from some of the characters. It's not scary, I'm not sure it's even trying to be scary - there are no jump scares and very little in the way of psychological horror.But it's all amiable enough and the short run time passed without me getting distracted and looking at my phone.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

For some reason, though, it brings back the character of Tommy Jarvis, who was memorably brought to life by Corey Feldman in part IV, brought back for sake of continuity in Part V, and is now here again.His inclusion adds some lame action movie set pieces nobody wanted like him breaking out of jail, unconvincingly, and a boring car chase that just feels like a distraction from what the movie is actually about: Jason slicing people up.Yes, we go back to ""Camp Crystal Lake"", which didn't feature in part V, and this is the only movie in the whole series in which children stay at the camp.It's also the only movie with no nudity at all, and comparatively little violence, the camera always cutting away when Jason gets down to business.Other than those things - which hardly make it stick out in the memory - there's really nothing about this entry in the series that makes it memorable or worth recommending to anyone other than hardcore fans.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
57,Stevieboy666,He's back - the man behind the mask!!,8,28 October 2017,"Tommy Jarvis decides to dig Jason up from the grave, only for him to be brought back to life by a lightning strike, Frankenstein style! And thank goodness he did because this is an excellent entry in the series. This film is notable for two things - it introduced humour & also in bringing Jason back from the dead he is virtually indestructible. In Alice Cooper it also has a great soundtrack. There's no nudity here & the gore has been toned down but it has a very high body count with many inventive kills, it's fast paced, well acted & is hugely enjoyable. Sadly the series went down hill from here...",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
58,kevin_robbins,This is easily the worst storyline and kill scenes of the first six movies,5,10 May 2021,"Friday the 13th VI: Jason Lives (1986) continues my run through the series from my personal DVD collection. The storyline focuses on Tommy Jarvis from the previous two films escaping from the psychiatric ward and returning to Jason's grave to ensure he's dead. He opens Jason's grave to find his rotten corpse. It is immediately struck by lightening, reanimating the body and beginning another killing spree. This movie is directed by Tom McLoughlin (Sometimes they Come Back) and stars Thom Mathews (The Return of the Living Dead I & II), Jennifer Cooke (V), Renee Jones (Days of our Lives), Tony Goldwyn (Scandal) and Ann Ryerson (Caddyshack). This is easily the worst storyline and kill scenes of the first six movies. There is one awesome kill scene where he folds the police officer in half the wrong direction, and another okay one where he bounces a guys face off a tree smearing a smiling emoji face carved into the tree with blood, but overall nothing that makes the series hall of fame. I liked the chain around his neck returning him to the lake ending, but that was about it. I'd give this one a 5/10.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

60,drqshadow-reviews,"Jason Returns to Crystal Lake in This Dull, Redundant Slasher Turd",3,17 October 2016,"After a lukewarm response to the franchise's new, Vorhees-free direction, the studio mandated that Jason somehow return from the grave in this ridiculous slasher sequel. FYI: repeated lightning strikes (and a conveniently-placed hockey mask) are enough to convert a rotting, maggot-riddled, decade-old corpse back into a stalking, menacing killer. I can't decide if it's genuinely this stupid or if the series has finally become self-aware enough to poke fun at itself. Either way, it's a swing and a miss. Beyond said resurrection and the victims' frenzied scramble to isolate themselves in the darkness and await a swift judgment, there's nothing to this plot. Just a bunch of random kills, pointlessly short ones at that, with the usual assortment of paper-thin caricatures and a grab bag of genre tropes. The entire film is literally explained in full during the bad, two-minute long Alice Cooper song that accompanies the closing credits. Tommy, the only recurring character to last for three films, has been recast for the third time and now plays something of a bumbling charlatan, spouting mystic wisdom from the depths of nowhere. Naturally, that's accepted as gospel and provides our only means for an escape from this madness. Typical of the series, it's pitifully acted (apart from new player David Kagen, who struggles to bring a dash of vigor to his watery role as the town sheriff), awkwardly executed and translucently obvious. The return to familiar territory provides a very mild improvement over the stinky fifth chapter, but that's not really a compliment.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
61,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""Jason belongs in hell, and I'm gonna see that he gets there!""",8,13 September 2019,"Little Tommy Jarvis, who looks like an entirely different person since his misadventure at the boarding house for disturbed teens but it's great because he's a lot more likeable and interesting now, decides that the only way to rid himself of the memory of Jason forever is to dig up his rotting corpse to make sure he's dead and then burn the remains, only thanks to a cemetery gate spike and a wayward lightning bolt, the hulking killer gets zapped back to life to begin a new bloodbath and is considerably deadlier than ever before! Thanks Tommy.. This is definitely one of the big standouts of the Friday the 13th movies, it was the one that made the biggest impact on my young self and it probably got me into the rest of them. Tom McLoughlin really did something that felt new and different with the same old Friday material and he did it the right way, making a movie that was highly distinctive from its blood splattered brethren, and that he managed to do that with the sixth entry in a series that was perhaps beginning to flag a little, was pretty amazing work! I love it, I totally see how it brought new life to Jason and the series in more ways than one, there was such a clear style and attitude to it that we'd never seen in the previous movies, and while not as gritty it did put things into a slightly faster gear that worked really well for it, it has just the right kind of easy sense of fun about itself that makes for one ideal 80s slasher romp! It's my favourite version of Jason, I love the way this guy moved, he looks really relentless and lethal as he tracks down his victims with his green beret survival power walk and spectacularly takes them out! I think Jason's undead upgrade fit him like a glove, never again would he be an inhumanly strong, backward lumbering brute who could seemingly be brought down by conventional wounds, but was for the rest of the series a supernatural being and undeniably a zombie monster that you just can't kill, and I for one feel that he works much better that way. A reason this movie is one of my favourites of the series is that to me it just has so many classic Jason moments in it, I really think it's his finest hour. I love the fun sequence when he ambushes and lops off the heads of three corporate business people who were playing a paintball game with one blow, and at the end of the terrific kill scene where he stands atop the burning RV, he looks so iconic there and that moment always stuck with me about this movie. There's an enigmatic little scene where Jason enters a cabin full of sleeping kids and gazes into the fire for a moment before noticing the one awake and terrified little girl staring at him, who approaches and looms over as she prays before inexplicably backing off. He looks curious more than anything else, and I love that quick scene because it's mysterious, Jason is pretty much a one note boogeyman, so it's cool when you get little snippets of insight into his unknowable character. Perhaps the reason he didn't kill her or the other children was because on some level in what's left of his twisted mind he remains the child he once was.. There's a kill that you basically don't even see, where the nicest camp councillor ever gets completely obliterated after an excellent suspenseful buildup, I feel so bad for her as she's established as so sweet and kind, it's awesomely horrible! Everyone else gets a simple gutting or dismemberment but he paints the damn cabin walls with her! I don't know what the angelic councillor did to tick him off so much, but that was clearly a personal kill for Jason!! It has my favourite ending to one of these crazy flicks, Jason looks so spooky as he floats in his watery grave, drowned again and subdued but not dead, and waiting... So while not a hundred percent perfect, I feel that part six is just a great popcorn slasher and one of the more sparking offerings of its kind, one that is still a classic macabre fun time, Jason is dead, long live Jason!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

63,drownnnsoda,Surprisingly Respectable Installment.,7,29 July 2006,"""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" starts off pretty interesting. Tommy Jarvis, who is now all grown up, goes back to Jason's grave one stormy night to make sure the maniacal murderer is really dead and that he has no chance of coming back. He opens the coffin, and stabs Jason with an iron fencepost, which is then incidentally struck by lightning, which somehow revives Jason's body. Now Jason is back, alive as ever, and he continues his rampage of teenage slaughter in the forests surrounding Camp Crystal Lake.I really enjoyed the opening of this movie. At least the writers made an attempt to revive Jason in a interesting way, rather than just have him randomly come back to life for more murders. Jason was presented as a more supernatural presence in this movie, which should've been well established way earlier, because no average human could survive all of the severe battle scars he's taken throughout the series. I mean sure, it is your run-of-the-mill ""Friday the 13th"" sequel, but this one at least tries to be something a little different, putting interesting spins on things. There were also some pretty inventive murder sequences too, which isn't uncommon in this series. The director keeps Jason lurking in the shadows throughout the film, having him pop up all over, which, while a little unbelievable, is also pretty effective and good for a couple of scares. It's still a pretty silly movie in it's essential form, but all of these movies are, really, but this one manages to have a lot of strong points and not too many weak ones.Overall, this is one of the better installments of the ""Friday the 13th"" series. And if you compare this to the pointless fifth installment, this film looks like cinema gold. While most of the other sequels are just cheap recycled stories of the other movies, at least ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" offers something a little fresh in the dulling series. 7/10.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Which does make the die hard fans of the series happy to bring back Jason in a fun, humorous way without losing his sadistic killing ways. This sequel also has one interesting plot hole (Something was mention by a character in ""Friday the 13th Part 5"") and Mathews' best known for ""Return of the Living Dead Part 1 & 2"".

65,JoeKarlosi,Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives (1986) ***1/2,8,27 January 2011,"Can the word ""brilliant"" be applied to a Friday the 13th movie? Well, that's what I'd call this one, which for my money is tied with THE FINAL CHAPTER as being best of the entire Friday THE 13TH franchise. You have to really hand it to director Tom McLoughlin, who knew how to handle a sixth sequel at this extended point in time and somehow manage to keep it exciting and interesting. McLoughlin was a fan of the old classic Universal and Hammer horror movies of the past, and he was gratefully able to inject some Gothic and classic style to the proceedings.Wisely bypassing the ending of the desperate NEW BEGINNING (that was part 5), we begin with a new actor playing an older Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews, who was better than John Shepherd), who sneaks out of his mental institution and searches for the grave of Jason Voorhees. He wants to put an end to his own hallucinations by digging up Jason's lifeless corpse and burning it to ashes. However, through a series of mishaps worthy of the old Universal Frankenstein films, Jason is accidentally revived with lightning and now emerges as a living monster/zombie... now more unstoppable and threatening than he ever was before. It's up to Tommy to play hero and stop Jason's new murderous reign of terror, if he can dodge the local town sheriff who thinks Tommy's only using the Jason motif to commit the killings himself.Director Mcloughlin decided to add some dashes of dark humor in his film, which actually compliment the grisly nature of the movie nicely without making fun of Jason Voorhees in any way. JASON LIVES was a welcome return to form for fans of this series, and when it was released to theaters in 1986, we cheered appreciatively and were glad to have ""our guy"" back again. Also featured are a couple of killer songs by Alice Cooper: ""Teenage Frankenstein"", and ""He's Back (the Man Behind the Mask""). A good horror movie with lots of fun, even for those viewers who may not particularly care for Friday the 13th movies. ***1/2 out of ****",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
66,Witchfinder-General-666,"Jason Lives, and He's Creepier than Ever!",6,7 August 2009,"I'm not a big fan of the ""Friday The 13th"" series in general, and would not call any of its part 'great' or even 'scary', yet it is undeniable that some of the films are vastly entertaining. The sixth Jason film, ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Par VI"" of 1986 is probably my personal favorite entry to the series. With this film, the series makes a refreshing twist into the supernatural. In order to continue the series, there obviously was a need for Jason to return after the Jason-less fifth part, and this film presents a Jason who looks creepier than ever.Tommy Jarvis, the boy who killed Jason Voorhees in Part 4, and who was sent to a loony bin in Part 5, returns to Jason's grave to send the mass murderer to hell once and for all. However, he accidentally awakes Jason who had been resting in his grave, and who, after several years, is devoted to returning to the killing-business more then ever...The makeup effects are great here, and the killings are gory and very well-done. The way Jason is resurrected may seem a bit far-fetched and silly - however, the entire series isn't logical, and this therefore doesn't matter at all. The people in this one aren't nearly as annoying as those in most of the other films, which makes this film more suspenseful. The presence of little kids makes the film scarier - after all, it is a lot easier to be scared for small children than for annoying teenagers. Furthermore, the settings of this one are great. All ""Friday"" films before Part 8 are set around Crystal Lake, yet the settings look different. This one has the great look of the first film, mainly set deep in the woods at the forest camp by the beautiful Crystal Lake - definitely the nicest killing grounds for good old Jason Voorhees. The film obviously had a pretty high budget, and looks great overall. Even the performances are way above par for the series (though Thom Mathews, who plays the protagonist Tommy Jarvis, isn't very good). This is the film in which it becomes clear that Jason has supernatural powers, and he also looks a lot creepier and more menacing than in any of the predecessors. The mess left by Jason in a blood-soaked room is one of the creepiest sights in any of the films, and ""Jason Lives"" has many other great moments. As mentioned above, I am not the biggest fan of the series, but some of the films are highly entertaining, and this one is definitely one of them. Recommended!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
67,aidanratesmovies,The Best Sequel of the Franchise,6,22 July 2020,"Moderately entertaining, often fun, and surprisingly well acted- Jason Lives is by far the best sequel in the Friday the 13th franchise, and a moderately fun and guilty pleasure sequel to watch and enjoy. The film is surprisingly well acted, especially by horror movie standards of the time. Standouts include Jennifer Cooke, David Kagen, and Thom Mathews, who all fully dedicate themselves in their roles. I also liked the portrayal of C.J. Graham as Jason in this film, and found his take on the character, as well as his look and demeanor to be refreshing- which is honestly something I would have never thought I would say about the franchise. The film does get tedious towards the end, with its repetitive scream kill run factor going on. It also is quite laughable at times, but in an amusing way, although it can be quite hard to take seriously and often pretty stupid. In the end however, Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives is a solid entry in the franchise. It may be more laughable than scary, but it takes the film back to the fun nature of the first film, and makes for the best film since the original as well.

Although Part 5 was terrible, Part 6 returns to the movie's roots to Crystal Lake and the main theme of Jason. Thom Mathews gives a good performance as the star of the film. The special effects are as good as the plot. Learning from all the mistakes from Part 5, Jason Lives makes it possible for the series to continue with more sequels. The movie ends with the possibility of Part 7 as Jason is seen alive at the bottom of the lake where he originally died. Not the scariest of the Friday the 13th endings, but one of the better endings. Jason Lives does justice to the series as the movie hits on all the original themes that Part 1 and Part 2 had.

In any case, Part VI (interesting sudden switch to roman numerals midway through the series) is more of the same; in what has to be one of the most imbecilic resurrection scenes (well, the way it's executed suggests the characters have no common sense) in film history, Mr. Hockey Mask is revived for another round of slice-n-dice mayhem.  The film's constant barrage of one-liners is distracting to no end (considering 99% of them aren't even funny), but the presence of B-movie himbo Thom Mathews, strong production values, a grasp of suspense, and the effective seasonal atmosphere (leaves rustling, etc.) make this a better (but still not very good) sequel.4/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
70,a_chinn,Surprisingly meta entry into the voluminous series,6,28 May 2017,"I don't think I ever saw this entry in the long running series before and was pleasantly surprised by it's tongue-in-cheek nature. This film wisely abandoned the dumb possession storyline from the prior film and brings back Jason Voorhees proper. This film also wisely returns to it's original Crystal Lake setting. What makes this film work better than others is that writer/director Tom McLoughlin fully embraces the predictable, formulaic nature of slasher films (years before Kevin Williamson did the same with ""Scream"") and ends up making a rather meta entry into the series. The story here picks up with the Tommy Jarvis character, this time played by Thom Mathews from ""Return of the Living Dead"" fame, trying to get rid of Jason's body once and for all, but ends up bringing him back to life. You can probably guess what Jason then wants to do the rest of the film. There's a lot of good laughs and also some decent suspenseful sequences and also an ending that seems to leave things quite open for many many more Friday the 13th films. Tony Goldwyn made his film debut in a small part as one of Jason's many victims and Ron ""Horshack"" Palillo has a small role as well.

71,mrdonleone,part VI? what a BEEP!,4,14 April 2009,"What's all this? Part VI seems to be happening as if part V never took place. Okay, the way Jason can come back to life is probably the coolest return in the whole series. The actors, however, are not that cool, and the actresses portray women as whores. No wonder many feminists were so angry on this movie (but, in fact, they were mad on the whole series, for not portraying female characters with more intelligence). This sort of horror movies - also known as slashers - let the audience see that women are sluts. Itis but to wonder if it really was (and is) so, or that it's all based on the thesis that guys are heroes and girls not (as in Temple of Doom). The women in this particular picture are portrayed stupid and dumb. They do idiotic things, like shooting paint on men with guns in their hands for fun. Yeah, that's really funny... What's also funny is the kind of humor in this film (sarcastic laugh): with only one cut, Jason beheads three of his victims at once. Pretty sharp sword, I would say.The cemetery scenes show us the horrors that await the characters, with fences around the graves (yes, you see them everywhere nowadays) to hold the dead in a cage, safely buried under the ground. If the young people 'visit' the cemetery, they break the cage of the dead, and by that, they give Jason a free card to go on killing the living after his death. Alcohol on a graveyard could mean the opposite of what we see, that the living are caged in the land of the dead. Because Jason lives, as the title says, it is probably that we are dead, or that we are maybe supposed to die.The few nudity scenes in part VI are worthless, you can't see anything in focus. So because there aren't any good nudity scenes in it, we must concentrate on the real horror in this movie.Since part V ended with a stupid death sequence that could hardly be called creepy (""die! die! die!""), it was actually a good idea of the director to do as if it never happened. But if part V never occurred, how did Tommy get the hockey mask of Jason in his possession? If part IV ended like it did, I would suppose the police put the mask safely away in a vault somewhere on the police bureau or something, unless Tommy's big sister would help her kid brother to hide that mask from the police. But why would she do something like that? Especially because she didn't return in part VI? Why??? 'Jason lives'? No, he dies almost every time, but he still manages to come back like Chucky or Freddy.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
72,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Supernatural Slasher,7,1 October 2019,"This was one of the Friday the 13th films that I actually only think that I've seen twice now. It never seemed to be on the movie channels and it wasn't until I got it on DVD that I believe I checked it out. I'll be honest, I didn't really care for it as this one does incorporate more comedy that the ones prior. I gave it another viewing as part of a horror movie challenge I'm doing though. The synopsis is Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) goes to the graveyard to get rid of Jason Voorhees' (C.J. Graham) body once and for all, but inadvertently brings him back to life instead. The newly revived killer once again seeks revenge and Tommy may be the only one who can defeat him.As the synopsis states, we see Tommy in a pick-up truck with another guy from the hospital that he's been living. Tommy is on a mission to ensure that Jason is actually dead. On top of that, he wants to completely destroy the body. His vendetta against him has taken over his life and he's not able to move on. Tommy digs up the casket and a storm rolls in. Tommy goes crazy, stabbing the corpse with a metal pole, which he leaves in the body. It is then struck by lightening, bringing the killer back from the dead. The problem now, he is supernatural.Tommy seeks out the local sheriff, Garris (David Kagen), who thinks he's crazy. When Tommy won't give it up, he's tossed in a cell.The next two victims are Darren (Tony Goldwyn) and Lizbeth (Nancy McLoughlin) who are on their way to the camp that's now reopened. They're the older counselors and supposed to be running it. They come to Jason blocking their way. Lizbeth wants to flee while Darren thinks it is someone messing with them. They soon realize this is the real deal. With them not returning to camp, this brings Megan (Jennifer Cooke), the sheriff's daughter, into the station along with Paula (Kerry Noonan), Sissy (Renée Jones) and Cort (Tom Fridley). They are concerned about the two senior counselors, but while there Megan is attracted to Tommy. Sheriff Garris tells them to leave and that the other two will show up.No one believes Tommy and while this is happening, Jason is running wild in the woods. He kills a group of executives on a team building exercise as well as anyone else that gets his in way back to camp. Tommy is trying to find a way to prove what he's saying is real, but will it be too late?Now watching it this time around with a more critical eye, I can say this isn't as bad as I thought it was the last time I saw it. I like that this does keep some continuity. This film seems to somewhat ignore the previous one, which is fine. Tommy was in that one as well, but it really doesn't have any effect here. The only thing can be said is that having killed Jason and then dealing with the fake 'Jason', that can help explain his obsession. I do like the psychological effect that this killer had on him. The issue I have though is that I feel like what brings Tommy there is a bit unreal, but I do like the Frankenstein angle of lightening bringing Jason back to life. It is also interesting with a song that Alice Cooper has on the soundtrack call 'Teenage Frankenstein'.I do have to give credit here that the franchise in order to continue on had to keep raising the stakes. By making Jason become supernatural, I can get on board with that. It really does ramp up the kills now that he has super strength. The issue here then becomes Tommy and Jason grapple with Tommy being able to hold his own. It is a movie, so I get why, it is just a bit uneven there.The last thing to cover here is the relationship between Megan and Tommy is bit off for me. I don't know if I buy that she would fall for him and go to the lengths that she does when she just met him. I do think she has a bit of a mischievous side and I dig it to be honest. It is intriguing though as slashers are known for their final girl, where this one kind of bucks that trend.If there's one thing I can say about this movie is that it is fun. This comes in at 86 minutes, which I think is a solid length for a slasher like this. It doesn't waste any time getting into Jason being revived and then the killers are right after. We get them at a good pace and this actually has a pretty high body count. I do think that some of the kills don't really have a bearing on the story and just have some groups here just so they can kill them off. I'm actually fine with this, as this one really we start to root for Jason and to see how he can kill these people next. I also think the ending is a bit weak, but not really enough to ruin it. It is a bit more brutal than I remember if I'm honest.I want to take this to the acting next. Mathews I think is good at taking over the role of Tommy. I could see Corey Feldman's version growing into this one and the actor in the previous film really didn't do it for me. I like his obsession here for sure and I think he's a decent actor overall. Cooke really intrigues me, because I love her personality. I don't buy she would fall for Tommy as fast as she does, but I'll let it slide. She's also quite attractive. I also like Kagen and how no matter what, he doesn't believe Tommy, especially since the evidence really isn't there. I thought Graham was fine as Jason. It is interesting here since he's the first who actually gets to play him supernatural. It worked for what they were going for. I would say the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.That takes me to the effects, which I thought were good. They all seemed to be done practically, which was in line for the era. Much like how Graham played the role of Jason, this film had a lot more to work with that they could go more outrageous with the kills. With that is the issue that can be a bit uneven at times. The blood and gore we got looked good, I have no issues there. I do think they used the wrong mask, but it has been a long time since I've seen the previous film, so I would need to revisit to confirm there. This one though is shot very well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I was excited to see that this one still had Harry Manfredini. This isn't his best in the series, but I really like what he did with the theme here and there was some good musical cues throughout that worked. I also have to give a shout out to Alice Cooper, who did some songs for the movie. It is interesting though, as I believe this is the first with actual ambient music in it. I will say that I really like 'He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)' and 'Teenage Frankenstein'.Now with that said, my thoughts on this really have come up after hearing podcasts and giving this a rewatch. I can see the arguments made and it did help me to appreciate this one more. I think that the series was at a point that the only thing they could do was go supernatural. I do think the reason behind it is a bit off, but I'm down for the Frankenstein angle. This does give them more creativity with the kills, which I liked. I don't really care for the comedy aspects of it, as it really doesn't land, but it also doesn't hurt the film as much as it did last time. The ending is a bit weak if I'm honest. It is more brutal than I remembered though. There are some inconsistencies with Jason's strengths as well. I do think that the acting is solid and the score is really good though. This is actually one of the more fun movies in the series for sure. I would say that this one is above average for me ad I would recommend to fans of the series for sure or if you like slasher films.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
73,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Much better than Part V,5,30 June 2019,"Jason Vorhees is one of those special villains who manages to stay a float no matter how bad the films revolving around him got. The first three films told one storyline centering around Jason's mythology. Then the fourth and fifth films connected to those by introducing a new character by the name of Tommy Jarvis. After seeing friends and family massacred by the machete wielding masked killer, Tommy has remained haunted by those moments since. However by this film, storytelling was way off, the characters were uninteresting and the series was really hitting a slump in its creativity. But for the series sixth outing, it actually managed to step it up a bit. By no means is it fantastic, but it is better than the previous entry before it.Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) is now a bit older than previous events and has made it his mission to destroy Jason (C.J. Graham) and the grave where his body rests. After failing to do so when a lightning bolt revives Jason from the dead, Jarvis heads back Camp Crystal Lake now renamed Camp Forest Green to warn the authorities headed by Sheriff Garris (David Kagen). Much to no one's surprise, Garris does not believe Jarvis and holds him captive. Meanwhile Jason begins doing what he does best; racking up the body count. All the while Garris' daughter Megan (Jennifer Cooke) wants to get to know more about Tommy. The script and direction was taken care of by Tom McLoughlin. Who actually helps make this film much more watchable.The script isn't perfect because it still has big hurdles to overcome, but it shows there was effort put in. First the problems. Being that the last film concluded rather obnoxiously, McLoughlin sort of had to overwrite the prior story. This leads to bad continuity in this second saga of Jason Vorhees Vs Tommy Jarvis. On top of that, much of the supporting characters are still as bland as ever. David Kagen plays his role like every other non believer, Kerry Noonan, Renée Jones, Tom Fridley and Darcy DeMoss are completely oblivious as to what's happening. The only three actors to really make anything of it was Thom Mathews as Tommy Jarvis, who at least has way more personality than John Shepard in the last film.Jennifer Cooke also tries to help when needed. C.J. Graham as Jason works too, with his lumbering yet imposing presence. What does work in the script though is the satirical tone that is used. Right from the beginning, the intro credits are introduced by Jason walking in on the screen like he's 007. There's also a character that references the fact that ""any weirdo wearing a mask isn't friendly"". These are things not expected, but clever. There's also a little more tension to this feature because the campsite is actually populated with kids this time. That can be scary. Unfortunately, the kills and the cliches that bring them are still not the best. It is still a step in the right direction though.The cinematography shot by Jon Kranhouse was well lit. Seeing Jason walking around during the day is different even though over time, the settings convert to night time. Even then, the images filmed are nicely lit. There's an underwater scene that looks very impressive too. Kranhouse would also film for Kickboxer (1989), Decoy (1995) and Something More (1999). Lastly was Harry Manfredini's score which also has improved and has thankfully stuck around. The score not only continues its usual Friday the 13th stings, but also includes the latin hymn Dies Irae into it as well. This not only makes the motif for Jason more distinguishable, but also more memorable. Nice.Concluding the Tommy Jarvis saga wasn't as good as it could have been, but it definitely finished better than expected considering its prior entry. The characters are still not that interesting and the kills are regaining some of their uniqueness, but it's not there yet. What really stands out though is the music, camerawork and some of the satirical additives the script throws in.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Even thought most parts of the series are quite bad, this one isn't that much. Actually, for it's gender, it's kinda good. Characters are all dumb like they're supposed to be, teenagers die while/after having sex, people don't believe in Jason's return, among another teen horror movies clichés. Deaths aren't innovative or anything, and sadly director hides them most of the time, but we can accept that as a way to not show how fake they are.

76,Sandcooler,"""Does he think I'm a fart-head?""",7,15 January 2011,"Wow, a lot of new stuff in this one. You have the new Jason, who is now some sort of lightning-powered zombie that can take even more physical abuse than before. He can't be bothered with running anymore, but obviously he still keeps up with his victims because that's just movie magic. C.J. Graham plays him very well by the way, Jason's actually sort of menacing for once. Then you have the summer camp itself, which for the first and probably last time in the series' history features actual children. It's fun to see that parents don't judge a camp just because its counselors get hacked to bits every time it re-opens. There are also some attempts at humour woven in, and most of them are really quite funny. I especially liked the Bond-parody in the credit sequence, misplaced but hilarious. Furthermore, Jennifer Cooke is easily the hottest main girl this franchise has ever had, so that's kind of a plus too. A very inventive entry, not the best one but it's pretty close.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
77,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Jason Lives, but a lot of others don't",6,16 February 2004,"Several years after he supposedly killed Jason, Tommy Jarvis digs up Jason's body, on Thursday the 12th, in the middle of a lightning storm, to make sure he's really dead, but then, well, read the title of the movie. He and cute little Megan (Jennifer Cooke) spend most of the rest of the movie trying to kill Jason yet again, while various others end up slashed by Jason and his machete. The Jason make up is pretty much non existent in the one - C.J. Graham is basically just a fat guy in a boiler suit walking around wearing a hockey mask - but this one kind of looks like an old 1960s Hammer horror/ Dracula/ monster movie (Come on, Jason is revived by a bolt of lightning! Even the colour composition looks similar) with more comedy than the rest of the series, beginning with the James Bond satire at the very beginning. Amusing to note also, this is the only Friday the 13th film to show Jason's rotten face at the very start of the film, but the other films in the series have an unmasking scene at the climax.I would almost give this film a 7 out of 10 because it is one of the better sequels, but it's hurt though by some atrocious acting (especially by Deputy Cologne) and a ridiculous ending. And did anybody else notice that Megan's character changes clothes three times in the first three scenes, even though the scenes take place all on the same morning?",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
78,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" or ""The Unexpected Virtue of Self-Aware Meta-Humor""- The best entry in the franchise.",9,2 September 2016,"""I've seen enough horror movies to know any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.""-Lizabeth, ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI.""Whelp, here you have it folks. Arguably the finest entry in the long-running ""Friday the 13th"" media franchise.Is it because it has the most hardcore, brutal kills of the series? Nope! Does it have the most bouncing bodies skinny-dipping in the water? Not at all! Does it have the most intense portrayal of psycho-killer Jason? Not a chance!No, this film succeeds as the best in the series for one simple reason: fun. It's just flat-out a fun movie. Thanks in no small part to a wickedly self-aware, satirical script courtesy writer/director Tom McLoughlin, filled to burst with savage meta-humor years before meta-humor was really a thing. Kevin Willaimson... eat your heart out! OK, I kid... I love Kevin Williamson... but McLoughlin did kind of beat him to the punch 10 years before ""Scream"" further revolutionized the idea of self-aware slasher-flicks.Tommy Jarvis (now portrayed by Thom Mathews in a role that more-or- less ignores the troubled Jarvis of Part V) has had enough of living in fear. He has decided to face his troubled past once and for all by digging up the body of Jason Voorhees and burning it to symbolically conquer his childhood trauma. But a hilarious bolt of lightning (in a cute nod to ""Frankenstein"") accidentally brings the beast back to life, now as an unstoppable ""Super-Zombie!"" Uh, oh. Now Tommy must team with the gorgeous daughter of the local sheriff (Jennifer Cooke) and try and stop the hulking Jason from taking out a new group of camp- counselors who are overseeing a children's summer-camp at the former Camp Crystal Lake. (Now referred to as ""Forest Green.) What follows is a surprisingly hilarious and sometimes creepy mixture of laughs and thrills, in a Hellish roller-coaster ride of mayhem.McLoughlin really seems in his element with this film. While his other work has been hit-and-miss, his keen sense of postmodern meta- humor jives well with the outlandish nature of the story. Nobody was going to be able to really take Jason coming back to life after all this time seriously... so the curve-ball of having the story border on self-parody helps make it a bit more appetizing and easier to digest. And thankfully, it lends to a general feeling of freshness throughout the whole film. We've seen this movie before five times... but not quite like this. Seeing characters acknowledging the outlandish nature of events, punctuating dialog with witty and humorous cutaway gags, and making Jason's kills less brutal and more Looney-Tunes-esque is just great fun and both a nice compliment and contrast to the previous films.It also helps that this film has some of the best characters and performances since Part III. (I still love you, Shelly!) Thom Mathews makes for a fun new Tommy Jarvis, who is both troubled but also very proactive, in a nice contrast to mopey-Tommy from the last film. Cooke is adorable and spunky as our lead heroine Megan, and though she doesn't serve much outside of a general love-interest who occasionally gets in on the action, you still really like her and root for her. David Kagen eats up the role of the grumpy Sheriff who is gruff but has a soft-spot for his kid. And even the generic Camp Counselor fodder characters portrayed by actors such as Kerry Noonan and Renée Jones are surprisingly likable. This film thankfully eschews the standard cliché of having to define characters exclusively by singular quirks, and everyone feels a bit more grounded and realistic. They're all more-or-less decent people, which helps us actually care when Jason starts knocking them off.Add to that a really effective score by series composer Harry Manfredini, some really good cinematography from DP Jon Kranhouse and some really slick visual direction, and you just have a good, solid, fun time all around. There's no sore thumbs in the production either in front of or behind the camera. They all work together to generate a well-oiled machine of madness that I can't help but love.I'm somewhat shocked to be giving this such a high rating, but I have to. ""Jason Lives"" is a 9 out of 10 as a horror fan. It's phenomenal entertainment, and it's self-aware sense of humor may even win over a few non-fans as well.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
79,rivertam26,This is the one where I started to fall in love,8,9 March 2020,"Although I've enjoyed all the ""Fridays"". This is the one where I began to fall in love. Starring Thom Matthews (The hot Tommy) of Return of the Living Dead he returns to Camp Crystal Lake to destroy Jason once and for all but ends up accidentally resurrecting him. This is where zombie Jason is born and the series begins to take on a supernatural tone. Tommy runs to the cops and they dont believe except for the sheriff's flirty daughter Megan played by a likable and very funny Jennifer Cooke (V). Jason begins to slice and dice everyone from goofy office workers playing paintball, new camp counselors and a young, hunky Tony Goldwyn (Ghost) in really inventive ways. Some of my favorites include a face through a steel wall, a head twisted all the way around and a three way decapitation. Directed by Tom McLoughlin (One Dark Night) brings an appreciated action, blockbuster edge to the material. In its opening moments when Jason arrives in an homage to 007 it's clear that the makers are not taking it seriously and neither should you. The movie is a much needed return to Jason as well as a refreshing and wonderfully entertaining take on expected material.4.25/5",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
80,Analog_Devotee,THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE,9,13 December 2020,"Tommy Jarvis is back and he's ready to kick some ASS!Hot chicks, great soundtrack, great kills... Part VI Tommy Jarvis has to be my favorite character in this franchise. Pure, unrelenting fun from start to finish. I know Kane Hodder is considered the best of all the actors/stuntmen who portrayed the legendary killer of Jason Voorhees, but C.J. Graham here is no slouch. He embodies this role to a T.I have viewed this flick from cable to VHS, from VHS to DVD, from DVD to Blu-Ray, from Blu-Ray to streaming services. I simply cannot get enough. After a few months, I get an unbelievable itch to pop this in and sit down with some popcorn and ginger ale. This is another flick I'll sometimes turn on for background noise if I'm in need of some audible company.After the awful (but, somewhat redeeming, I'll admit... if you catch me in a good mood) entry of Part V, an entry which was neutered by the FCC, this was such a surprise for most F13 fans. The future had appeared bleak until Tom McLoughlin took the directorial reigns and blew us away with not only his superb directing chops, but an amazing script to boot! ... A former mime directing an 80's slasher ... There has to be a joke in there somewhere, right? Oh, forget it.If you haven't seen this yet and consider yourself a fan of 80's horror and slashers alike, I'm not sure what you've been waiting for.

It's not just horny teenagers in an abandoned house and Jason happens to show up and kill them which about 4 sequels are. Tommy Jarvis wants to make sure Jason is dead. (Pretend Part V never happened!) Him and a friend go to the cemetery to make sure, but Tommy accidentally brings Jason back to life. This is the one where Jason becomes more of a zombie and walks, instead of running. Tommy gets thrown in jail, and the Sheriff's daughter, Megan begins to have a crush on Tommy.

82,baumer,The last of the passable Friday the 13th's,6,26 August 1999,"When I first saw the poster for the film, I was excited. It is a great atmospheric poster with its dark colours and the mask emanating light from it. I was also excited about the title. Jason Lives, that means that they are bringing him back to life and Roy will stay dead. Now, if only the film could have been as good and creepy as the first four, it would have been a great film. As it stands, this isn't as good as the first four but it kicks the hell out of the last three. So what we are left with is a passable entry in the series.Jason comes back to life via Frankenstein tactics, which should make him even more powerful. And there are scenes in here that would support that theory. One being when one of his victims is bent over backwards and gets snapped in half. So his brutality is still alive and kicking quite nicely. But what this film is missing is the ""feel"" and the ""texture"" of the first four. And to be honest I can't really put my finger on it, but there is just an intangible missing from the sixth episode that was so prevalent in the first four. It's strange though, this film does a lot of things right. It has Jason lurking mysteriously in the background and it uses some decent shots. But it just wasn't that scary. It was entertaining and humorous and that is fine, but I don't want to see a funny Friday the 13th, just as I don't want to see a funny Nightmare On Elm Street.The way Jason is killed in this one is actually quite good, because we are now starting to get into the folklore of Jason. What makes him tick and what can kill him. Having Tommy research the method of death is a good way to go. It's just too bad that they didn't just leave it alone after that. Or better yet, if they actually wanted to make a Jason Goes To Hell, have them go back to their roots and use the techniques that scared us back in 1980-84. Because now Jason is just a pale replica of what he once was. He hasn't quite eroded in this one, but he is coming close.Friday VI is not a bad effort, it just could have been so much better.

84,mentalcritic,They don't make them like this anymore...,1,20 September 2004,"and for that, I am eternally thankful. By the time the FT13 franchise got to six episodes, it was plumbing such depths that it couldn't even bring a memorable kill to the table. Like the previous five films, part six recycles so many plot elements from each other, and other, more creative films, to the extent that one can forget which episode they are watching after a while. Part six doesn't even try to be original. It's a simple case of Jason getting resurrected, killing a few people, then getting killed again.Even the kills are not unique enough to be fun anymore. We've seen it all before, and the other staples of the FT13 series have been stripped back to such an extent that they cannot compensate. The sex quotient of this episode basically consists of sticking the camera in the female lead's lap, and the actors are wooden enough to make Keanu Reeves seem expressive.Speaking of the actors, they're an irritating bunch this time around. It's no easy task to be a secondary antagonist, but the whole ""where the red dot goes"" exchange, among other things, just turns one off the characters in an instant. It might have worked if there had been some setup, or moments when the characters don't seem like complete bastards, but sadly, the makers neglected to add this to the script. The most developed character in the entire film is Jason himself, and given that his entire backstory was developed in the first two episodes of the franchise, that's not saying very much.As an experiment, trying naming the ways in which the cast are killed off during this episode. I can only remember one, and the manner in which it was realized does not make it all that interesting. I'm not even sure that I'm remembering something from another episode and transferring it to this one. Believe me, this episode needs all the help it can get.Not surprisingly, the cast of this film have never acted in anything that could vaguely be described as above this level before or since. As a further exercise, try naming anyone who acts in this film. It's like trying to name the cast of a menswear commercial. That basically summarises the entire film. It is a waste of eighty-six minutes of your life, from which you will literally remember nothing, even if you watch it as part of a group.I gave Friday The 13th Part VI a one out of ten.

85,hnt_dnl,"Another overrated ""even"" movie",2,26 October 2021,"Growing up, I remember liking the even-numbered Friday the 13th movie over the odd ones, but now that I'm older, I think I'm re-evaluating my critique, or at least I'm finding the odd ones better than I remembered and the even ones worse. I know that the acting in these movies is notoriously not good, but Part 6 JASON LIVES (1986) might have arguably the worst acting of the series! The acting is so BAD. Everyone overacts. Why is every character so hyper in this movie? Everyone is literally shouting and yelling their dialogue at the top of their lungs. Why does the Sheriff sound like some gumshoe in a 1950s film noir flick? Lol He was obnoxious and mean from the first second to the last that I was so glad that he bought it in the end. And the Sheriff's flirty, bug-eyed daughter, who looked almost the same age as her ""father"" wasn't much better. And they look nothing like each other anyway. Then all the ""teenagers"" in this movie are completely forgettable. Part 6 is also notoriously the first film where the camp actually had campers this time as there are a lot of little kids in this movie, some of whom actually act better than the adults.Thom Matthews is easily the worst of the 3 actors who played Tommy. John Shepherd and Corey Feldman were so much better in the prior 2 movies. And why is Tommy like 30 years old in Part 6 when he was only 10 in Part 4 which came out 2 years earlier? And when a movie makes me forget that Horshack from Welcome Back Kotter is one of the 2 characters in the infamous opening sequence, THAT is a forgettable film indeed. Then there was the suspenseful music played over EVERY scene. Even during suspense scenes, music should be played sparingly and there are times when silence is scarier than noise. I remember as a kid thinking that this was one of the best sequels and even the best movie of the franchise, but that couldn't be further from the truth now that I'm older. I took it way too seriously back then and even looking at it as a silly slasher flick, it doesn't hold up at all. The gross overacting and lame dialogue make this one a weaker entry in the series. The movie tries to be dead serious and comes across as 100% laughable. ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder"" does not apply to this movie.

This Friday The 13th entry is in my opinion better than all that came before it, this can be due to the fact that this was the first movie I ever snuck into after being turned down at the door. (I did get into The Final Chapter) it was certainly worth it because of all the entries this has the best quality of the bunch, in that the production values while cheap are more polished.

90,jluis1984,The beginning of the end...,6,14 November 2005,"Many people dislike Friday the 13th. Many find the series stupid, not scary and consider it ""mind-less entertainment"". I believe that's because they have not seen the previous 5 movies. Part VI is were the now considered classic Jason clichés(unstoppable, mindless zombie who can walk faster than you run) was created.The story: Tommy Jarvis, the boy who killed Jason in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, has decided to destroy Jason's body in order to stop the nightmares that haunt him and face the demons of his past. He must have the worst luck in the world because, as he impales Jason with an iron stick, a thunder fall as and brings back Jason in a Frankenstein-homage scene. Now that Jason is back as a zombie, it's up to Tommy to stop him... Bad news is that nobody believes that Jason is now a living dead, and Camp Crystal Lake has been opened again under a new name, so Jason has a lot of work to do.This movie follows Tommy's attempt to finally kill Jason, but it gave me the impression that the movie was done with the purpose of pleasing Jason's fans who were disappointed with Part V. Unlike previous movies, where Jason was the hidden killer, here he receives a lot of exposure and has the highest body count.This movie may help to illustrate the evolution of the slasher genre through the 80's. The movie is more campy & funny and less scary & gory. Gone is the suspense of both Parts 1 & Miller's 2-3, and gone are the realistic gory killings of previous movies. Jason goes over-the-top but at the same time tones down the graphic violence of the killings.Support Character Megan plays the sheriff's daughter who is more concerned in getting in Tommy's bed than with Jason's Legend. She is probably a reflection of that long gone age that were the 80's.Direction is fine, lighting is just fine... neither good nor bad, just the usual 80's slasher. Since Jason became supernatural the series went downhill and it's no surprise why the Friday series lost it's impact and ended up battling the other ""used to be good"" franchise in ""Freddy VS Jason"".Good slasher, probably the last good Friday movie, but don't expect too much.A solid 5/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This movie is the bomb this movie is the best horror slasher 80's movie in my opinion. They don't make movies like this anymore. I really wish that Hollywood would make movies like this one today. This movie has everything I just love to death from the setting, from the music from the actors just everything it has in here.Tommy Jarvis goes to the graveyard to get rid of Jason Voorhees' body once and for all, but inadvertently brings him back to life instead. The newly revived killer once again seeks revenge, and Tommy may be the only one who can defeat him.Thom Mathews is the best Tommy Jarvis in my opinion I love this actor so damn much he is so underrated. Tom McLoughlin resurrected Jason Voorhees and he made so damn good job the best film he directed and writing it. I just love it so damn much. Jennifer Cooke was great as Megan Garris and she was likable I love her so damn much in this movie. I love David Kagen as Sheriff Garris he grow on me he gave 100% of him. I love Kerry Noonan as Paula she had the most heart in this movie. I love Tom Fridley as Cort seriously he looks like young Johnny Depp in this movie. Whole cast is serious and does excellent job I love everyone in this movie. I love Bob Larkin as Martin on the graveyard I love his lines ""Some folks sure got a strange idea of entertainment."" I love the actor so damn much in this movie. I love the graveyard the scene that was filmed in this film I love C. J. Graham as Jason Voorhees he is excellent as Jason I love him so damn much on the screen. He gave 100% of him, oh he didn't? Yes he did! It was so joy able to watch this movie in Thursday that I was jumping from excitement so much I love this movie.I love the songs from Alice Cooper who performed the songs for this movie I wish Alice Cooper would have been extra in this movie. He was extra in John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness which he produced and sung the song Prince of Darkness. I love soundtracks from this movie: He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask) the best song ever. I have heard the song many times. Teenage Frankenstein and Hard Rock Summer are the best soundtracks from Alice Cooper. The Song Animal is the best song from the movie I am listening I loved it. I have so fun with this movie the best of the best.I love the kills, ""even if it has humor on it"" what humor? I haven't seen any humor in the movie but I saw a great slasher film that's what I saw. Martin Becker made special effects and he was great I love practical effects in this movie I love good kills.This movie has Jason walking around like a Terminator from the first film we even have a Deputy Colone (Vincent Guastaferro) aiming with Dan Wesson Model 15-VH with a big laser sight on Tommy in which Megan use the gun either. It see similarity with these movie and with The Terminator from the 80's. The resurrection scene for Jason is excellent made given these movies I can go with it. I love the James Bond homage in the opening credits. This movie felt a little bit more like a movie from the Halloween franchise with Tommy and company going after Jason and that is probably why I loved it.I love the final climax showdown between Tommy and Jason on the lake set on fire in the climactic scene in the boat. Tommy is attacked in a boat in the middle of the lake and ties a boulder around Jason's neck to trap him. Jason fights back, holding Tommy underwater long enough to drown him. I love the sacrifice scene from Tommy that he sacrificed him self and he chained Jason in the lake which he belong. Tommy is a bad-ass in this movie is my action hero.I love this movie to death I love everything about this movie it is my number 1 favorite Jason film. This movie also has action I forgot to mentioned but it has ton's of action it is great entertaining action horror film.This movie get's my favorite Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 the best Friday the 13th slasher movie ever I love it to death. They aren't movies like this one today we don't have them anymore.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
92,eminkl,Awkwardly executed and translucently obvious,3,18 April 2020,"After a lukewarm response to the franchise's new, Vorhees-free direction, the studio mandated that Jason somehow return from the grave in this ridiculous slasher sequel. FYI: repeated lightning strikes (and a conveniently-placed hockey mask) are enough to convert a rotting, maggot-riddled, decade-old corpse back into a stalking, menacing killer. I can't decide if it's genuinely this stupid or if the series has finally become self-aware enough to poke fun at itself. Either way, it's a swing and a miss. Beyond said resurrection and the victims' frenzied scramble to isolate themselves in the darkness and await a swift judgment, there's nothing to this plot. Just a bunch of random kills, pointlessly short ones at that, with the usual assortment of paper-thin caricatures and a grab bag of genre tropes. The entire film is literally explained in full during the bad, two-minute long Alice Cooper song that accompanies the closing credits. Tommy, the only recurring character to last for three films, has been recast for the third time and now plays something of a bumbling charlatan, spouting mystic wisdom from the depths of nowhere. Naturally, that's accepted as gospel and provides our only means for an escape from this madness. Typical of the series, it's pitifully acted (apart from new player David Kagen, who struggles to bring a dash of vigor to his watery role as the town sheriff), awkwardly executed and translucently obvious. The return to familiar territory provides a very mild improvement over the stinky fifth chapter, but that's not really a compliment.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
93,The_Movie_Cat,`I've seen enough horror movies to know any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.',5,9 February 2003,"The first of the Friday movies to introduce a supernatural element, this may have led to the execrable Jason Goes To Hell, but is introduced here with considerable style. As with the title quote, It's more knowing than usual, and while not clever enough to be considered post-modern, it still amuses on occasion. One of the funniest bits is the title sequence, where Jason does a Bond-spoofing `gunshot walk'.Fantasy had flittered around the series right from the start: Jason was a deformed mutant living underwater, and the sequels had seen him take would-be fatal blows yet survive. Here though he's resurrected by lightning.None of the films from the third onwards could even remotely be considered scary, so Jason Lives inserts comedy characters to pep things up. It's quite funny seeing Jason doing his usual stalk n' slash through the woods only to bump into some executives playing paintball. One of the subtler jokey references is a momentary shot of Jean Paul Satre's `No Exit', which is a nice touch.This time around the camp workers have small children to look after, so the usual `horny teens take their clothes off' scenes are notable by their absence. This also creates a narrative problem in that you know no film would show infanticide and so you also know the children are intrinsically safe.Some of the exposition is a little heavy, the dialogue often dumb, but at other times it can be humorous, as with the following exchange:`Why don't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's alright?' `We have. Tried to track you down, the phone there's disconnected.' `Doesn't that tell you something?' `Yeah, they should have paid their bill.'Direction is also above average for the franchise, with a nicely shot climatic underwater sequence. 5/10.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
94,fernandoschiavi,"Part 6 can be considered one of the best in the franchise, it's worth it for Jason's triumphant return, for the creative massacre, for the conclusion and soundtrack",6,7 September 2021,"Massacred both by critics (who was never very sympathetic to the franchise) and by the fans themselves, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning left a clear lesson: the movies would not survive without Jason Voorhees, who in that film was just the memory of a of the characters and an identity to be assumed by the real antagonist of the story. Thus, Paramount wastes no time and already makes explicit in the title of his new misadventure: Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Vive. But not only is the return of the son of Pamela Voorhees the big draw, but also that the playfulness has finally arrived at Crystal Lake. And that, amazingly, is great.The plot starts practically with a retcom of the previous one, with Tommy Jarvis (replaced by Thom Mathews) still tormented by his visions with Jason and determined to do something about it. With the help of a friend, they invade the cemetery where the killer's body is buried, but after a gruesome twist, lightning strikes Jason's corpse and he returns as some sort of indestructible zombie. Stronger, painless and relentless, he advances to a new camp built in the former Crystal Lake, now occupied by a group of children, and Tommy is the only one determined to stop him.The most important thing to appreciate Jason Vive is to accept ridicule. In every major franchise, at some point the movies start to become self-conscious and flirt with an openly trashy line, see Freddy Krueger's absurd nightmares in Wes Craven's movie sequels or even agent 007, which he saw in Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan opportunities to use ridicule to his advantage. So when Jason is struck by lightning in one of the stupidest scenes in the series (Tommy opens his coffin and starts kicking him unnecessarily, creating the problem he needs to confront), and we see his increasingly monstrous face roaring, we see that Paramount knows what kind of film they want to make. The film even has a vignette in the best James Bond style, with Jason entering the frame and throwing a machete towards the screen!The main feature of the film, in relation to the series, is the fact that Jason starts to show, definitely, superhero status, the kind that seems to have a closed body. Jason easily resists gunshots, slams, drownings and road accidents, leaving behind any remaining human traces and turning into a monster in human form. The origin of his powers was never explained (or was it the energy coming from the rays?), and I believe the fans never bothered. In this chapter, too, the series descends into humor. Proof of this is an unnecessary sequence with a paintball game in the first act of the film, which has nothing to do with the rest of the story. This, without a doubt, is one of the most embarrassing moments of the entire series so far. The attempt to add dark humor works as an attempt to bring a new element to the series, but takes away any tension, mainly because, in general, the jokes are very poorly written.But it's not all bad: the film marks Jason's return to Crystal Lake, and that's very welcome, reminiscent of the first two films in the series. The lake is there just as it was left, and the cabins look the same. The inclusion of children in the camp brought an extra element that had been quickly explored in chapter IV, precisely with the character of Tommy, here again the protagonist of the story, who has his continued story within the ""saga"" (but again we have another actor the interpreting). With regard to the children, we can observe Jason's behavior towards them, but the script is far from threatening them, and in the end the serial killer ends up not killing any infants, as would be expected.The attempts at innovations in this film were so many that even in the soundtrack we noticed changes, for example. In addition to the well-known suspense songs from the series, we have songs sung by the famous Alice Cooper, including the song ""He's back The Man behind de mask"" was a clip created solely for this movie. Also from Cooper, there are other songs like ""Hard Rock Summer"" and ""Teenage Frankenstein"". Felony also makes his mark on the score with the song ""I'm no Animal"". We still have good references to the movie ""The Nightmare Hour"", when a girl named Nancy wakes up scared and says she had a nightmare about a man chasing her. I found it interesting and if you like the Freddy Kruguer franchise, you will smile with this scene, simple, but very symbolic.The film's deaths are more neat than in the previous chapter, although quite caricatured (the chief of police, for example, who is folded in half like a hospital bed). Some of Jason's actions are clearly forced to ensure greater drama, which is nonetheless a cheap manipulation by the script: why Jason fills a victim's room with blood? This same kind of hatred did not occur when he ignored, in front of him, the girl near the end of the film, leaving her alive. There are also some continuity errors that show the lack of care in finishing the film, something that would happen again much later: in one scene, day is breaking, and then it is night again; Jason's clothing is very new and clean for someone who came out of the coffin practically in a state of decay. Anyway, details that, added together, show that the producers wanted to make money more than providing a somewhat coherent story.Already with this trashier approach, the script by Tom McLoughlin (who also signs the direction) manages to elaborate a plot that could even be more cliché and sleepy if we were using the old atmosphere of the series, but that takes on fun contours here. For example, McLoughlin creates several subplots that don't connect to the main narrative, just to create different ""antologies"" of deaths around the old Crystal Lake. It's worth noting the nonsense of a corporate paintball game that is soon frustrated by Jason, or when a couple in a Volkswagen Beetle meets the killer in the middle of a road, and the girl practically predicts the Scream franchise when she says ""I've seen too many horror movies to know that a masked person in the middle of the night is a problem,"" in a good sample of the film's amusing metalanguage.Effective in the script, McLoughlin is also a creative director. While he doesn't bring deaths as elaborate as those in the Final Chapter, the director is amused to bring a little humor and nonsense to Jason's attacks, and even puts us on his side through several stages; never before have we seen the killer before the victim, and here we even have reaction shots of the masked man, who seems surprised at his own brute strength. Also worth mentioning is the clever montage, which creates subtle raccords purely through the order of the shots, like when Jason hits a guy right in the middle of the forehead with a knife, and the next cut shows us a dart board on the wall.Of course, it's an imperfect result and it misses the balance. The desperation of Mathews' performance as Tommy seems to suggest the subject is in the wrong movie, and it doesn't help that Jennifer Cooke's character has an almost unhealthy crush on the protagonist. It's funny, but we didn't make a big deal out of these characters, just the policeman played by David Kagen, which gains more strength towards the climax. It's a shame to see the core of the camp's children, as we never got to know them completely, limiting ourselves to a few quotes and catchphrases.Tom McLoughlin's film brought innovation, but without leaving the tradition left by the previous ones, some deaths come with a lot of humor, such as the paintball player who is thrown into a tree and the impact is marked by a Smiley face. But all of that makes the movie fun. Jason is stronger and crueler, after this movie, he would never be the same as we saw in parts 2, 3 and 4, but his thirst for blood would continue to grow more and more. With a good pace and even some suspense, something that practically didn't exist in the sequels from the third part onwards, this Part 6 ends satisfactorily with a beautiful death of Jason, who returns to the depths of the lake of ""Forrest Green"" - and it is ironically greeted with a sign at the bottom of the lake that reads ""Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake "". The script has nothing new, but the characters escape the commonplace of the series. There is, for example, the couple who spend the entire movie having sex, nor the goofball who runs uselessly after their hot friend. Part 6 can easily be considered one of the best in the franchise, it's worth it for Jason's triumphant return, for the creative and diverse massacre, for the conclusion and for the soundtrack.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
95,mario_c,"""Zombie-Jason"" has a good heart! He doesn't kill little kids!",2,19 February 2009,"This movie is bad! Comparing with the previous five movies, it's by far the worst! It starts bad and it ends awful, and I think there's almost nothing good in it! The beginning is just ridiculous because it starts almost like the fifth part, and again with TOMMY (the character is just in the same age he's in the fifth movie, but it's with a different actor! Ridiculous!), but with the silly idea that JASON would back to life by the power energy of a lightning, becoming a ""Zombie-Jason""! Terribly absurd, but not as much as the pathetic humor the movie has. Better, it tries to be funny, with pseudo dark-humor, but it ends being just pathetic. And we must also notice that this ""Zombie-Jason"" has a good heart! Yes, that's true, he doesn't kill little kids! Worst movie in the series so far! If it's true that the previous five might be a bit repetitive, in the plot, scenarios and characters, it's also true that they could be called masterpieces comparing to this low cost piece of crap! For me this movie lost the entire JASON mystic; what didn't happen with the previous sequels! Even the soundtrack was spoiled!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
96,acidburn-10,Back On Form,8,13 June 2007,"After the somewhat not bad but disappointing part 5, I'm glad to say that the series is back on form with this one. Definitely one of the better ones in the series.The plot = Tommy Jarvis is back this time played by Thom Matthews attempts to make sure that Jason is dead and will never come back, but instead he accidentally brings him back to life as a zombie and again Jason heads off into the woods killing of happy go lucky teens, can Tommy stop him once and for all or will he end up as another one of Jason's victims.Part 6 is a definite step up in the series, Add to that Jason now being a Zombie which spiced up the game, some gnarly and ambitious set pieces (all about that RV scene), a couple of inspired kills (the body bending bitouch!) and some hard pumping Alice Cooper songs and you get a hands down crowd pleaser. I was also glad to say that they have better actors this time and likable characters, also the James Bond type opening was brilliant. Although only a few things that were slightly disappointing like the fact that the series is no longer scary anymore or the death count in this one isn't as high as some of the other ones, but other than that this movie kicks ass.Tommy Jarvis is yet again played by a new actor Thom Matthews who gives a solid performance really strong and engaging performance and he's also really good looking which really adds to the boost. Jennifer Cooke (Megan) was sexy and was also a great character she's my 2nd fave heroine in the series next to Amy Steel, and what's also nice to see that she's not one of the virginal stereotypes heroines, she's quite flirty and likes sex as much as anyone and she's also the sexiest girl in this movie and the entire series and plus her chemistry with Thom Matthews was really engaging and spot on. David Kagan (Sheriff Garris) was fab as the tough cop he had all the best lines and also loved his bad ass routine, it's again nice to see the cops are more developed in these movies usually they're just there in Slasher movies as comic relief and to just add to the numbers. Tom Fridley (Cort) played his part well and was really funny. Cort's girlfriend Nikki (Darcy Demoss) although a small role but she was fun, Paula (Kerry Noonan) and Sissy (Rennee Jones) were also fine in they're roles and Deputy Rick (Vincent Guastaferro) was quite amusing in his role as the bubbling cop who gets outsmarted by Tommy and Megan and he also has the best line in the ""Wherever The Red Dot goes you bang"".I also like to mention that the directing in this flick was brilliant McLouglhin injected the movie with a Gothic atmosphere, lots of slick shots, some effective slow motion and a tighter than tight pace. I also loved the fact that he's taken Jason in a new direction, and plus the paintball gun scene was brilliant.All in all it's obvious that part 6 was created with love and effort Not only does did the flick continue the Jason saga with confidence and class; it also had no problem standing on its own two undead feet. Granted, it wasn't the blood-fest that were the earlier entries and the fear factor was on the low jive but the top notch production values, the lovable cast, the superior script makes this more than just a standard Slasher flick.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
97,Darkside-Reviewer,Jail!,6,19 August 2020,Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives was the first movie in the Friday the 13th franchise to feature a resurrected Jason Voorhees who after lightning strikes his dead body becomes an unstoppable killing machine with super strength and the ability to always find a hockey mask with an axe mark in it from part III.The decision to bring the Jason Voorhees character back from the grave was due to the previous entry Friday the 13th part V: A New Beginning underperforming at the box office which at the time was the lowest grossing movie in the franchise although the movie did make a profit of $22 million dollars (US) against a $2.2 million dollar (US) budget which is still a huge profit. The movie also suffered from poor reviews by both fans and critics who labelled the movie as nothing more than a quick cash grab with a predictable and laughably bad twist ending.Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives was released just one year after Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning and completely ignores the events of Part V and wastes no time bringing Jason back to life before the opening credits have even been shown. The movie stars (Thom Mathews) as adult Tommy Jarvis who accidentally causes Jason Voorhees body to get struck by lightning reviving his worse nightmare and making him even stronger than before. Most of the movie focuses on Tommy Jarvis trying to convince the Sheriff that Jason is alive and the other half is of Jason Voorhees doing what he does best killing people in fun and twisted ways.The Friday the 13th franchise is notorious for having a lot of it's most violent death scenes cut by the MPAA and Friday the 13th Part VI is no exception. The previous entries tried adding more gratuitous nudity into the movie to make up for the lack of violent death scenes but Friday the 13th Part VI did something different this time around instead of nudity the movie was given a more comedic tone. The movie doesn't take itself to seriously and is a lot of fun to watch it does deliver some cool and interesting kills with some jokes and moments that will genuinely make you chuckle once or twice.I recommend watching Friday the 13th part VI at least once just for the experience alone. There aren't many mainstream Slasher movies from the 1980s that are as funny and violent as this movie is.,Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

99,innocuous,A mixed bag in the series....,4,24 November 2009,"I'm not a big fan of the series anyway, so you'll have to take my comments with a grain of salt. Some of the other reviewers have pointed out that this entry gets back to the basics of the series. I don't think that I would agree. The whole Jason ""mythos"" is pretty incoherent in this movie and doesn't make much sense. It certainly isn't consistent with the two previous movies (which were pretty bad) or the first two (which were heavy on the slasher and light on the supernatural).What IS a big improvement here is that you get some more imaginative killings. Jason also has a bit more personality than in Parts III-IV, which makes for a bit more fun, but demystifies the whole endeavor.We can't end, however, without pointing out that Part VI has NO (nada, none, zippo...) bare breasts. Maybe I got a censored DVD from NF, but there were absolutely none in the film I saw. (Actually, this might explain why the editing and continuity seemed a bit off. But if you think you saw some, let me know what scenes they were in.) I mention this only because it is such a notable departure, not just from the series, but from ALL 80s teen slasher flicks.So, there you have it. Better than some Jason flicks, but not as good as the first two.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

He decides to go back to Crystal Lake Town where his remains are buried and make sure his body is cremated but unfortunately he accidentally brings him back to life like Frankenstein through a pole in his chest thus making him into a powerful and very strong zombie-like creature that is hard to kill and is out for more senseless killing.

The camp has reopened for business for everyone wants to forget those tragedies as the nightmare has returned for another round of butchering.Truly awesome installment of the wickedly cool Friday The 13th saga! this is one of the best installment thanks to a sharp sense of dark humor, an Alice Cooper soundtrack and an early appearance by Tony Goldwyn. After the last movie didn't satisfy the fans due to no appearance of the real Jason in the last movie when they intended to have a different killer in each sequel but the makers decided to bring Jason back from the dead.

He was pretty much just a hard-to-kill human in parts 2,3 and 4 (and Jason wasn't even the killer in parts 1 and 5).  So they finally decided to make this guy truly unstoppable!I wouldn't say this was a very mind stimulating movie.  This film was made purely for the fans!  There is no real rhyme or reason to the film, it's just Jason running around killing people.  I guess that's cool if that's what you want.The cast was surprisingly good, some of the acting was sub-par, but what can you expect from this sort of movie?  There is one cast member that I think really deserves some notice, Jennifer Cooke, a fine actress and quite the looker too.  It was also a pleasant surprise to see a younger Tony Goldwyn (""Ghost"", ""Kiss the Girls"", ""The 6th Day"") in a very small role in the film.I didn't think this installment was anything spectacular, but it had some good stuff in it.  Like I said above, the story is for the fans, so don't expect anything special.  If you liked the previous Friday the 13th films, then go ahead and give this one a shot.

104,raypdaley182,Really Awful!,1,21 October 2007,"I have to start by saying Jason Voorhees died drowning as a child, the killings at Crystal Lake were done by his mother who died in the 1st film and will be referred to as either ""Jason"", The Killer or Hockey mask.This film is similar to part 5 in that is doesn't start with a recap of the previous films and has a new actor playing Tommy. We are supposed to assume this follows on from part 5 as he is being taken by a nurse to destroy the corpse of ""Jason"". Clearly this nurse doesn't know he escaped hospital in the previous film and doesn't question why Tommy has the proper ""Jason"" mask (which he didn't have, he had Roy's mask with the blue stripe so they made a mistake already).The lightning hitting the metal fence rod is VERY unlikely (so another mistake and the plot derailed from this point).1st dead is Allen Hawes The Nurse. tommy drives to the local sheriff in Forest Green (formerly Crystal Lake!) and admits to grave robbery and is put in jail. The next people we see are 2 camp councilors on their way to Camp Forest Green and run into Hockey Mask, 2nd dead is Darren the male councilor. 3rd dead is Lizabeth the female councilor.We are then introduced to a group of kids working at Camp Forest Green who come to tell the Sheriff (he is Megan's father) that the 2 main councilors are missing.This is the 1st ""Friday"" movie where The Killer has actually been seen in daylight. Filling the standard role of Crazy Old Man (there's one in every part) is Martin, The Cemetery Caretaker. Megan implies today is Friday The 13th (so his 1st 3 victims were all killed on Thursday 12th, the WRONG DAY, IDIOT!) and a bus full of kids arrive at the Camp.We are then introduced to Larry & Stan who are paint balling in the woods of Forest Green, I assume the guy with the machete who is 4th to die is the ""Bert"" that Larry & Stan were talking about. Larry, Stan & the unknown female executive are 5th, 6th and 7th to die. (We never see if Roy dies) Tommy decides to go check the cemetery as the police are escorting him out of the county and he is captured and driven out of Forest Green by the sheriff & Rick, his deputy.Right, the young adults working at the camp are Cort (the buff huge ego guy), Megan (the sheriff's daughter), Sissy (the feisty black girl) and Paula (the Molly Ringwald lookalike). We then meet Steven & Annette picnicking in the forest and Martin is 8th to die. Steven & Annette are 9th & 10th to die.Paula & Sissy go to check out a scream which turns out to be young Nancy (who thinks the monster was ""real, like on TV"" and deserves to die for saying that). Nikki (the girl Cort was screwing in the Winnebago) is 11th to die & Cort is 12th to die (pretty stupid of The Killer as he was driving, and where DID The Killer get that tool-belt he was wearing?). Deputy Rick finds the bodies of Darren & Lizabeth and The Sheriff leaves Megan alone in the jail to go join Rick.Tommy phones there and Megan goes to join him. By this time The Killer has reached the camp. Some limbs of one of the paint ballers is also found by Rick. The Killer cuts the camp phone lines (pointless as The Sheriff's office is empty anyway) & Sissy is unlucky 13th to die. The Killer scares Nancy (carrying Sissy's corpse past the cabin window) & Megan & Tommy are corralled into a roadblock and caught by her father.Nancy finds The Killer's machete and takes it to Paula who takes her back her cabin. The bodies of Cort & Nikki are found and Tommy is finally given an alibi by Megan. Paula finds the phone out and the machete gone and is the 14th to die. (There are now NO live adults at the Camp to protect or watch the kids). Megan tricks Rick, frees Tommy and locks Rick up so they can escape to banish the soul of Jason.Tommy does at least admit Jason died in Crystal Lake (In 1957 he says) and they intend to banish The Killer by sending him to the same place and fate. The sheriff and 2 other cops arrive at the camp to check things out. The Blonde Cop is 15th dead & the dark hair cop with the mustache is 16th dead after trying to comfort Nancy.The Killer is shot 6 times by The Sheriff (and had been shot by the dark hair cop at least 5 times) and runs into the woods as Megan & Tommy arrive. Tommy goes to the pier (finding the dead blonde cop) leaving heavy chains in a boat. Megan's voice attracts The Killer and The Sheriff attacks him (unarmed! idiot!) and is 17th dead for his troubles. Tommy ties the the chains on a huge rock & waits for The Killer who goes for the kids, spares Megan and goes out to Tommy wading into and under the water (which according to Tommy's theory SHOULD have killed him there and then). Tommy sets fire to the water (with gasoline) and fights with The Killer who jumped onto the boat.Tommy gets the chain tight around The Killer's neck as the boat sinks and is strangled underwater, Megan dices The Killer with the boat propeller and he is 18th dead. Megan brings Tommy ashore and gives him CPR meaning Tommy Jarvis has now survived 3 movies. The film ends showing the chained body of ""Jason"" with an eye open so the undead is still undead and Tommy's idea failed. A weak ending.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
105,jhaggardjr,"Best ""Friday"" movie after part 4",5,3 March 2002,"I thought the ""Friday the 13th"" movies should have stopped after the fourth movie which was subtitled ""The Final Chapter"". The fifth film, subtitled ""A New Beginning"", was a disaster. However the sixth film to follow, ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"", was an improvement over part 5. And it's still better than the other films that followed afterward, making it the best ""Friday the 13th"" movie after ""The Final Chapter"". This movie is just the same old stuff that we saw in the earlier movies: Jason Voorhees stalks and kills people around Camp Crystal Lake (which has been renamed Forest Green for this film). So, big deal. To Jason it will always be Camp Crystal Lake no matter what. The question is how many people Jason will kill and how he does them in. But this film has one major element that the other movies in the series lacks, and that is humor. The humor is handled very well here, and it helps the film to be much better than it could have been. Plus one thing that I was glad to see once in a ""Friday the 13th"" movie, none of the characters using drugs for a change. However, those elements can't make ""Friday the 13th Part VI"" a masterpiece. It doesn't even top the first couple movies in the series. It's all too familiar with all the violence and gore. And therefore, I have to give ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" thumbs down. But not a big thumbs down like ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" or any of the movies that followed this one. It has some good things working for it. As far as the acting goes: Jennifer Cooke is pretty good (and very attractive) as the heroine, but David Kagan comes off very annoying as her father the sheriff.** (out of four)",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
106,PedroPires90,Great one,8,14 August 2021,"It's between this one and Part 2, right? Technically, this is the best one. Tonally, I probably prefer the Part 2 as a Friday the 13th film.Hard to decide between the two - which are the best of the saga - and very curious, as they show us two very different Jasons (on Part 2 he didn't even had the mask yet; on this one we see, for the first time, the supernatural Jason).",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
107,baileycrawly,Flawed But Enjoyable,8,27 October 2019,"I have one big issue with his movie from the get-go.Part V ended with a fantastic twist (I won't talk about what it is for fear of spoiling that film). It made me really excited to jump into this one only to find that this movie.... did nothing with it. Literally. It's like it never happened (to me, at least, it made no narrative sense).That being said, I really love the Tommy Jarvis story arc of this franchise. For me, they've been the best, most entertaining ones, and this was absolutely no exception. I found myself getting into the characters and story arc of this one more than any of the others, which isn't typical of the sixth entry in a slasher franchise.THIS was what I wish the original had've been. It's got some story flaws, but they can be overlooked in favor of a really good, well-acted story. And we also need to add a mention to the fantastic soundtrack, with special nods to Alice Cooper's Man Behind the Mask and Felony's I'm No Animal.I really enjoyed this film.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

111,mcfly-31,the last really good one,7,30 November 1999,"Hate to sound harsh, but Tommy is a dumb ass.  I mean, Jason's dead and buried (for several years after part 4) and I suppose because of the events of the previous film, he reeeeally needs to know Jason's expired.  So he and a buddy dig him up to cremate the body just to be absolutely sure.  Before this can be accomplished, an angered Tommy shoves some fencing in Jason's chest, which is then hit by lightning resurrecting the wacko.  So if you think about it, Tommy is responsible for the 16 people that die in this movie, which, to me, makes him a dumb ass.  But fortunately he was so that we could be supplied with entertainment and Jason definately doesnt disappoint.  3 heads slashed off in one swing, face into a mirror, head twisted off, etc.  Writer-director McGloughlin should be credited as making the last good film of this series, his woodsy-campy atmosphere right on the money.  And Graham was the best Jason, with that intimidating fast walk of his.  The ending, though without the usual splattering of Jason, is still inventive.  Matthews is a better Tommy, as John Shepard was not brought back to play the part, but I couldnt see him having Matthews energy anyway. Cooke is very cute, but as far as the other femmes or their breasts, this is one of the rare ""Fridays"" without nudity.  But this is still great, with that nicely shot, creepy opening and a good sense of humor.  Not very scary, but these films havent been scary since the first one, with the emphasis put on gore in the following films.  In my opinion the last good one before things went downhill.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
112,domino1003,The Best (And Funniest) of the series!,8,23 July 2005,"""Friday The 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" is incredibly funny.Now, when one usually says ""funny"" when it comes to a horror film, some people assume that ""funny"" means unintentional laughs.Seriously, it is funny. And the laughs are intentional. It makes for an interesting mix, though. One moment you're screaming your head off, the next your laughing your head off. What gives? Well, thanks to Tommy Jarvis, the survivor from part 4 (And now played as an adult by Thom Mathews), Jason is revived by lightning as Tommy is attempting to cremate him. Tommy gets away, and Jason is back to his job, which is killing stupid, horny teens.Meanwhile Tommy is arrested. Seems that the people that live in Crystal Lake (Now called Forest Green)would rather forget about their association with Jason. Megan, the daughter of the disbelieving sheriff, helps him to escape. Tommy is determined to finish off Jason once and for all and knows where Jason is headed: To Crystal Lake.Some of the deaths are brutal, but also incredibly funny (The corporate team, for example). But the lines are funny, too (One kid hiding under a bed says to another kid, ""So, what WERE you going to be when you grew up?"").As for Jason, he is pretty much all business in this film, using whatever weapon is available (Especially his trusty machete).The best of the series before it started going downhill and New Line took over the franchise.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Through an improbably series of events involving an iron fence post and a thunder storm, Jason is resurrected and Horshack bites it. Frankenjason spends the whole movie wandering around and killing folks while Tommy tries to convince a hostile sheriff that Jason is back. This is one lousy film.

115,emperor_bender,Another great F13,7,19 February 2008,"I enjoyed this movie as much as the last. Here we follow Tommy Jarvis again. The 5th movie doesn't seem to exist in this one, but that doesn't make it any less good. This movie tried to mix in some comedy it seems, I thought the 5th movie was funny, this one wasn't bad either. This movie had some interesting kills, as well as a few random but brilliant scenes. Plus, Tommy Jarvis is played by Thom Mathews, who starred in the awesome Return of the Living Dead, and its awesome sequel Return of the Living Dead II. He didn't even seem like the same person in those movies (notice how I said ""person"" not ""people"", ROTLD fans will know what I mean). Plus there were some actors in this movie I had actually seen in other movies. Like Thom, Alan Blumenfeld (Larry the paintball guy), Tony Goldwyn (Darren the head counselor), Nancy McLoughlin (Lizbeth, his girlfriend I guess). My biggest grievance is the guy who played Jason, he just didn't play him the way Jason should be. Jason was too fast, and too human like. I give this a 7/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
116,Gafke,A lot of fun,8,11 February 2006,"After the disappointing pile of crap that was Friday the 13th Part 5, Jason Voorhees fans should appreciate this return to the real hockey masked killer and his nemesis, Tommy Jarvis.Tommy, who viciously slaughtered Jason Voorhees as a little boy in Part 4, is now an emotionally troubled and very angry young man, played by Thom Mathews (who also appeared in one of my favorite zombie films The Return of the Living Dead). Tommy has been plagued by bad memories and nightmares ever since his slaying of Jason and so decides to trek out to Crystal Lake with his buddy Hawes (aka Horshak) to finish Jason off once and for all. After digging up Jason's grave and opening the cobwebby and maggoty coffin, Tommy goes ballistic, stabbing Jason's dead body with an iron spike ripped off of the cemetery fence. Unfortunately, Tommy has extraordinarily bad timing: a lightening storm descends over the cemetery and one convenient lightening bolt later, Jason is alive and well and is ripping Hawes's heart out of his chest with his bare hands. Tommy is then off and running, trying to warn the local sheriff of Jason's resurrection, but the sheriff dismisses Tommy as a nutcase and later believes that the young man is responsible for the new string of bloody murders. However, the sheriffs pretty blond daughter believes Tommy and decides to help him, breaking him out of prison and hunting Jason down...but not before Jason can decapitate a bunch of yuppie paint-balling executives, slaughter an annoying fornicating couple in a mobile home, slaughter two camp counselors at the newly re-opened Camp Forest Green and terrorize a little girl. Can Tommy finish what he foolishly began and kill Jason before he and his new girlfriend are killed themselves?This, along with part 7 and 8, are my favorite sequels in the Friday the 13th series. Thom Mathews is great as the haunted and ultimately very foolish Tommy. C. J. Graham is satisfyingly brutal as Jason Voorhees, displaying all the right qualities of rage, curiosity and dumb innocence that Kane Hodder would later improve upon. This is a somewhat spoofy, darkly funny and satisfyingly bloody installment in the prolific series. The opening sequence, featuring Jason's maggot-ridden corpse, is perhaps the best pre-credit sequence of any of the Friday films yet. Hardcore Friday fans should not miss this 6th sequel. 8 out of 10 stars for Jason Lives!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
117,bh_tafe3,Good Stuff,6,11 December 2008,"This is the Friday where things get a little silly, and that isn't a bad thing. As a matter of fact, they do such a good job at over the top stupid in this one that it's a damned good thing.Tommy Jarvis, who's recovered his sanity, (partially, he is still a mental patient), sets out with a friend to dig up Jason's body and cremate him. Tommy believes that this will destroy his evil once and for all and free Tommy for a normal, happy life. Well that last part's just speculation on my part as he doesn't actually say that, but the part about ending evil is solid.So he gets stuck into Jason's corpse with a big long piece of metal which is truck by lightning and revives Jason who dispatches Tommy's friend and then, in a piece of film making worthy of Scorsese, the camera zooms in on Jason's eye and we see one of the greatest opening credit sequences ever! Jason, channeling James Bond, walks suavely in front of the camera, pulls out his machete and slices down. Kill me now, my life is complete! This is the greatest moment in movie history! Seriously, it's pretty funny stuff from here as Jason goes on a tongue in cheek murderous rampage, killing some truly stupid people, many of whom are quite funny. And Tommy saves the day, ending the rampage he in fact caused.There is a sex scene in this, but I can't remember any nudity. Anyway, fun movie which put some life back into Jason, and this is the movie I always think of when people ask me about the Vorhees character. Good stuff.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

I was disappointed with 3,4, and 5 it just didn't have it like 1 and 2 did. In the opening scene the movie gets you hooked with a very exciting opening; without going though the previous movies. I just thought it was a waste to take 10 minutes or so to catch the viewer up on the previous movie. I thought the cast did a great job, they all worked together, to produce one hell of a sequel. My favorite character was Sheriff Garris, his character was great. I also liked the fact that more than one survived Jason's wraith. I didn't think Megan would be the one to save the day, though. I thought it would be Sheriff Garris that would end up saving Tommy. That would have been some kind of bond, since Garris couldn't stand Tommy at first . Those two were at each other's throat in the beginning. The ending was great and Megan was the biggest surprise to me; and THX to Megan, Tommy survived. This film had it all the excitement, gore, and humor. I was really impressed with this one,a great job done by all. As for the sequels that came after,sorry but they just couldn't compare 2 Jason Lives.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
119,DigitalRevenantX7,Best of the Paramount-era sequels.,5,17 April 2008,"Plot Synopsis: Years after he killed serial killer Jason Voorhees, Tommy Jarvis visits Jason's grave in order to destroy his body. But he accidentally reanimates it. Now an unstoppable zombie, Jason heads back to Camp Crystal Lake, killing anyone who gets in his way.This is the sixth entry in the ""Friday the 13th"" saga. Unlike the previous five films, which were all formulaic hack-&-slash, this one has a lot going for it. The acting is better than average, the heroine is a lot more savvy than those before her, the script throws up a lot of in-jokes & references (loved the Bond-style opening credits), the killings are more spectacular. In fact, this entry is the best of all the Paramount-era sequels.

120,squeezebox,"An improvement over PART V, that's about it",4,28 January 2003,"JASON LIVES is marginally better than A NEW BEGINNING, but still pretty lame. Tommy Jarvis (Tom McGoughlin from RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD) and a friend (the guy who played Horshack on Welcome Back, Kotter!!!) travel to the cemetery where Jason is buried to make sure he's really dead. They dig him up, see he's in there, dead as a doornail, but a convenient bolt of lightning brings him back to life. Jason gets up, dons his hockey mask and gets back to work. The only real difference between this one and the others in the series is its attempts at slapstick humor, which don't make things much more interesting. A guy's head is impaled on a tree branch which breaks off revealing a smiley face, Jason does a double take when he sees a camper rocking as two teens screw inside, a trio of survivalists are decapitated simultaneously, a guy's head is crushed causing snot to squirt out of his nose, a girl's head is smashed into a wall leaving an imprint of her face, and other various ""moments"". Not much in the way of skin, relatively restrained gore and the aforementioned hokey humor make this one a fairly boring entry. It does, however, have an amusing parody of the James Bond opening at the beginning and features a theme song by Alice Cooper over the closing credits.

Part One was Good, but Jason wasn't there. Part Two was boring and introduces Jason. Part Three Jason gets his mask, very entertaining. Part Four Jason dies, quite good. Part Five was a dream, bad sequel. Part Six has Jason coming alive and is my favourite out of the lot. Part Seven has Jason battling a girl with telekenic powers, not too bad. Part Eight has Jason walking in Manhattan, slow but has some good scenes. Part Nine was one of the worst, with a ridiculous storyline. Jason X was superb. Apart from Jason X, this movie has the most death toll, Jason kills his victims in a entertaining way. Great Fun.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
122,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Thrilling And Entertaining Sequel. One Of The Best Films In The Friday The 13th Series.",10,8 October 2014,"Friday The 13th Part VI:Jason Lives is an excellent and thrilling sequel and is one of the best films in the series that is filled with great atmospheric direction,a good cast and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make Jason Lives my favorite movie in the series and a classic in the Friday The 13th franchise.Friday The 13th Part VI:Jason Lives finds Tommy Jarvis(Thom Matthews)is still haunted by the events in part IV and V wants cremate and burn a dead Jason Voorhees(C.J Graham)at his grave site but things go wrong when Jason is brought back from the dead by a bolt of lighting and is ready to kill again at his old stomping ground Camp Crystal lake(renamed Camp Forest Green). With the help of feisty Camp Counseler Megan Garris (Jennifer),Tommy vows to destroy Jason once and for all.Friday The 13th Part VI:Jason Lives is a brilliant Friday The 13th sequel and is one of the best and better films in the franchise that was my introduction to Friday The 13th and Jason Voorhees and to this day remains my favorite Friday The 13th film. After the unintentionally hilarious Friday The 13th:A New Beginning left a bad taste in Friday fans mouths,Jason Lives was seen as a return to form for the series and has become a fan favorite since it's release in 1986. What makes Jason Lives very entertaining and memorable is the way writer-director Tom McLoughlin approaches the material giving the series a shot in the arm giving fans a movie that is stylish and atmospheric as well as very explosive and thrilling with intensity and fun. And while Jason Lives has most of the trademarks that are associated with the Friday The 13th series and other Slasher movies there are thing Jason Lives that feels fresh and creative with an energy and pace that never stops until the very end. One of the things that makes Jason Lives such a great sequel is the Humor that is hilarious and nonstop with lines and characters that are funny which makes JL light but not too light. The Humor and laughs are also funny because the pop culture references and self aware thinking that the characters have which predates the Humor and style that Scream(1996)would do 10 years later. Although the film is funny there is a creepy and intense atmosphere with white hot suspense that hangs over the film with fog,dark clouds,rain and wind which is a homage to the universal Horror films of the the 1930s and 40s and when Jason is around the atmosphere is more intense. Where most characters in Friday The 13ths and other Slasher films are lined up to be killed and slaughtered the main characters in JL are likable and memorable to the point we feel bad for them when things start to go haywire. What's interesting about JL is the fact that little kids are at the camp which raises the stakes of the movie even higher because when you watch the movie you will wonder would Jason go after the kids? Watch the movie and find out. By the sixth film in the series Jason not only became a Horror icon but also a pop culture icon and antihero and with Jason Lives Jason is the star of the movie. When Jason comes back from the grave he is stronger and more powerful than he was before because guns,knives or any other weapon will stop him from killing people in a brutal fashion. While Jason in 2,3 and 4 was running a lot in Jason Lives he is in some cases a Zombie who walks really fast and no matter how far the victims run Jason will catch up with you. The blood and gore are on full display here with Jason doing what he does best and that's sneaking up on his victims and killing them in gory ways with some of the biggest body count in the series and while the blood and gore is light compared to some of the other films in the franchise the red plasma is still there. Jason Lives is Jason at his brutal and bloody best. The ending in Jason Lives is amazing and one of the finest endings in the entire series with tons of thrills and excitement with a few surprises that will stay with Friday The 13th fans. An incredible ending.The cast is wonderful. Thom Matthews is terrific as Tommy Jarvis with Matthews bringing the right emotion to the role. Jennifer Cooke is wonderful and sexy as Megan Garris,a camp counselor and sheriff Garris' daughter that helps Tommy. C.J Graham is outstanding and menacing as Jason Voorhees and is a great precursor to Kane Hodder's Jason. David Kagen is fantastic as Sheriff Michael Garris,a tough sheriff with a heart of gold and Megan's Father. Renee Jones(Sissy),Kerry Noonan(Paula),Tom Fridley(Cort),Nancy Mcloughlin(Lizbeth)and Tony Goldwyn(Darren)do fine jobs as the other camp counselors. Vincent Guastaferro(Deputy Rick),Courtney Vickery(Nancy),Darcy DeMoss(Nikki)and Ron Palillo(Hawes)give good performances as well.The direction by Tom Mcloughlin is amazing and stylish,with Mcloughlin always moving the camera and giving the movie an atmospheric and stunning look. Great direction,Mcloughlin.The score by Harry Manfredini is sensational,creepy,intense and is one of the best scores in the series matching the tone of the movie perfectly. Incredible score,Manfredini. There is also great Rock songs in the movie from Alice Cooper(He's Back-The Man Behind The Mask,Teenage Frankenstein,Hard Rock Summer)and Felony(Animal).In final word,if you love the Friday The 13th series,Jason Voorhees,Horror films or Slasher movies in general,I highly suggest you see Friday The 13th Part VI:Jason Lives,an excellent and thrilling sequel that is one of the best films in the franchise. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

124,Rendanlovell,Yes,7,20 July 2020,"This is by far the best of series and not just because it's the most tongue in cheek. It reminded me of the tone in Killer Klowns from Outer Space. It's very goofy and self aware but it takes itself serious for the most part. The paintballers near the beginning are a little too slapsticky for my taste. Other then that I love the the tone of this.Jason is actually a menacing villain who is genuinely terrifying in moments. He is treated seriously as the villain of the film. The other characters are much more goofy but the threat is taken seriously which is why this works. Plus, Jason utterly annihilates everyone he comes in contact with. He folds a guy in half, throws a guy into a spike, rips a girls head off, and decapitates 3 people at once. There's a few memorable kills in the other movies but this has like 10 great kills.Another thing I loved about this is that it actually has a story. There are characters you like doing things based off their own intuition. They make decisions based off things they know and take measures show they are right. You understand them and why they are doing the things they are doing. There's a great sheriff character who believes Tommy Jarvis is replicating Jason kills and he tries to keep him detained. Meanwhile, Jason wreaks havoc on every person he comes across. Characters have things to do, people are likeable, and characters actually take steps to stop this unstoppable force.Who has rightly, finally become a supernatural type force who needs to be handled in specific ways. Which means, as an audience, we know what's happening at any given time and can see what they are trying to accomplish. This is also the most visually interesting so far. There's many sets and locations that keep things fresh. It's absolutely the best Jason movie and leagues better then every single other one in the franchise. The characters are compelling, the story has plot points, and Jason is totally menacing as he stands on top of a burning RV he toppled.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Now we have a graveyard, a skeptical sheriff, scared children, and an RV. Just when you think there aren't any more new ways for the victims to die (or for Jason to die again), along comes something you don't recognize. This entry has plenty of ideas, it makes the previous chapters in the series, especially parts 1 & 2, seem like time-wasters. What I also admire about the making of ""Jason Lives"" is that the filmmakers make Tommy truly care about what Jason is doing. Or maybe that's just because he's older.

One storming night, he manages to talk his friend Allen (Ron Palillo) to accompany him to Jason's grave. In a hope to clear his head once and for all and end his nightmares, Jarvis must prove to himself that Jason is indeed dead. They dig up the grave and Tommy stabs the dead corpse with a metal fence post. Before you can say Frankenstein, lightning strikes the post and bang! Jason lives just like the title says. The rampage begins all over again with Tommy having no luck convincing the local sheriff (Kagen) that Jason is back and on the war path. The body count starts as Jason makes his way back to Crustal Lake just in time to see a new crop of camp counselors who are actually taking care of real campers this time. This marks the first time in the six film series that actual campers are on the grounds. Part VI, with its ""Frankenstein"" opening has a lot of energy and the storm provides realistic atmosphere. Director Tom McLoughlin adds a much needed sense of humor to this chapter and the film more than delivers on the body count fans expect. The characters are paper thin as usual, because if one of them were to think for two seconds the movie would end. There are a few jump scares that work and some solid gore as usual and a high body count. For those looking for more of the same you'll get it, if you're looking for something new?

The ressurection of Jason on a graveyard is a bad-ass smart idea in the film. Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) stabs Jason (C. J. Graham) with a steel and a lightning storm resurrect Jason from the dead is a smart idea and the best scene I have ever seen. Writen and dircted by a bad-ass director Tom McLoughlin who was the best choice for this movie. The director made a Jason unstoppable supernatural force ever in the franchise. Starring Thom Mathews as Tommy Jarvis the hero in this movie he is a bad-ass action hero I have ever seen.Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives and Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood are my two favorite horror slasher films. This is my top number 1 favorite film in the franchise The New Blood is my second favorite slasher film. This film has action, great death kills, gore, love the graveyard scenes, I love the cast. I love, love, love this movie to death!I love Jennifer Cooke as Megan she is one hot sexy babe but Tina Shepard (Kar Park-Lincoln) is my favorite final girl. I love Megan to death she is one hot sexy babe. I love Paula (Kerry Noonan) she was the heart of those kids counselors. I love Cort (Tom Fridley) he looks like young Johnny Depp in A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) my personal favorite slasher film of all time. I am A Nightmare On Elm Street fan that is why I name my username like that. I love David Kagen as Sheriff Garris he was a bad-ass a cop who has to do his job by protecting kids and his daughter I love him.Thom Mathews is the only Tommy Jarvis for me not Corey Feldman or that actor from Part V. Alice Cooper made songs for this film: He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask) which is a bad-ass song, Teenage Frankenstein and Hard Rock Summer which is hard to get this song. I love Animal by Fellon which it is a bad-ass song.This movie is fast paced, the pacing is fast, death kills the gore are excellent but I still prefer The New Blood death kills better than Jason Lives. My favorite scene is when Jason slashes with machette paintball players three at once. I love when Jason stabs with a knife Cort in the head and the van flips ovrer and explodes it has an excellent explosion but New Blood has better explosion than this film. Jason Voorhees played by C. J. Graham was believebl enough and scary. C. J. Graham was a trained marine and he obey orders and everything that director said.The Finale is a bad-ass scene on the boat Tommy Jarvis set a trap for Jason and chains him, while he burns the lake on a fire bad-ass scene. This movie is a creative the film has kids in it for the first time, which is more interesting. They don't make movies like this anymore. Excellent horror film from the 80's Jason Lives is tied with The New Blood I love both of the films to detah and so damn much.

129,ReelCheese,"Highly-Charged Jason, Highly-Charged Movie",7,10 June 2006,"From its spectacular, squirm-in-your-seat opening to its exciting finale, ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" delivers. Still haunted by his killing of the masked maniac two films ago, our hero Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) ventures to Jason Voorhees' grave just to be sure he's really dead. When a lightning bolt strikes the metal fence post Tommy uses to puncture the corpse, Jason is resurrected (remind you of someone?) and ready to hack his way through another terrified group of campers and innocent bystanders. But with no one ready to believe that Jason is indeed back, it again falls to Tommy to put evil in its place.The ""Friday the 13th"" series got back on track with this installment following a Jason-less fifth entry that remains a bitter disappointment for many horror buffs. Director Tom McLoughlin struck a magnificent balance between breathing a new life into the franchise and maintaining the look and feel of what fans have come to expect. The picture is fast-paced, smart and, at times, legitimately scary. Jason suddenly seems more evil and terrifying given his newfound strength as a member of the Walking Dead Club. McLoughlin's oft-praised attempts at humor are rarely successful, but at least he chose (wisely) not to mock the zombified star, as the most recent Jason films have.""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" is not Hitchcock, but it is a highly-entertaining effort that never once reveals its low-budget limitations. Horror fans and those looking for a good scare will be pleased.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
130,geminiredblue,Good Old Spooky Fun!,8,19 November 2014,"The Jason series has gone through its share of ups and downs. Most of the sequels rank somewhere in the middle. But, right in the mix, Part VI is hands-down the most fun. The story: Tommy Jarvis (the Corey Feldmen character in Part IV and the troubled teen in Part V) has finally decided to end the nightmare once and for all. In an awesome opening scene (on a dark and stormy night, of course) Tommy and a friend drive to the cemetery where Jason is buried. Upon digging it up, Tommy angrily desecrates the body. But wouldn't ya know it, because of that dark and stormy night, some lightning gets channeled into Jason. Now with recharged batteries, the man in the mask rises from his tomb to wreak terror and bloodshed on the quiet town once more. So now, Tommy and a few friends try to put Jason back into his grave. But things aren't gonna be quite as easy, since Jason's more powerful than ever and the police are hellbent on placing the murders on Tommy. Overall, it's a brilliant and witty entry. Worth tracking down for some good old spooky fun!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
131,happyendingrocks,"Note to self: if you defile the grave of a mass murderer, don't do it during a lightning storm",6,20 April 2011,"This sixth installment of the Friday The 13th franchise scores some points right off the bat by pretending that A New Beginning doesn't exist. But with an increased emphasis on humor and one of the tamest rosters of kills in the series, this outing is decidedly uneven, and it still falls somewhere in the middle of the rankings for the most enjoyable film of the franchise.Thom Mathews takes over the role of Tommy Jarvis, although his portrayal is not nearly as sensible as the admittedly solid turn by John Shepherd in the previous film. The best thing Mathews has going for him is a strong resemblance to Michael Dudikoff (a real missed opportunity there; an 80's F13 film featuring Dudikoff versus Jason might have been pretty awesome). The opening scene, in which Tommy ventures to Jason's grave to dig up and cremate the body to send him to hell (?!) features some great images of a zombified Jason, but most viewers will have trouble getting past the rather nonsensical impetus for the killer's resurrection, which requires him being struck by lightning not once, but twice. Of course, I won't be dropping a spoiler when I tell you that Jason is brought back from the dead, upon which he embarks on the killing spree that you were hoping for when you put this DVD into your player. And you should under no circumstances question how Jason still has eyeballs despite being severely decomposed and overrun with maggots. Just don't, okay?One thing the film does do rather smartly is drop the pretensions about there being a mysterious killer at work here. While previous films utilized time-tested POV camera work and kept actually seeing Jason under wraps until the final reels, Jason Lives acknowledges who the star of the show is in its very title, and he's seen in all of his rotted glory every step of the way.The afore-mentioned humor is largely rather lame, but there are moments of brilliance. A couple of clever sight gags, such as a pre-teen camper falling asleep reading Sartre's ""No Exit"", show a bit of intelligence on behalf of the film-makers. Though most of the one-liners fall flat, the film almost reaches genius with a line from Martin, the drunken cemetery care-taker who stumbles across Jason's exhumed grave. In one of the great fourth-wall-breaking moments in movie history, Martin looks directly at the camera as he wonders aloud, ""Why'd they have to go and dig up Jason? Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment..."" One plot point deserves special mention, simply because it's an interesting idea and infuses a bit of realism into a series that has never really bothered with that sort of thing. The denizens of Crystal Lake changing the town's name to ""Forest Green"" to avoid unsavory attachments to the Jason legacy is a very nice touch, and again it shows that the film-makers at least put some thought into this one.Perhaps the biggest problem with Jason Lives is that there is almost zero gore in the film. Since this installment is bereft of scares or suspense, the very least we can hope for is a few interesting kills to satisfy the promise implied by Jason's name on the marquee. Sadly, that element is notably non-existent here, and while I'm not sure whether the MPAA or the film-makers are to blame for the tepid approach to the violence in Jason Lives, we are left with a slasher movie without the slashing, and none of the bloody bits even come close to the fare we would get in an average episode of CSI. The only red sauce on display here comes courtesy of off-camera suggestions, with blood splashing against windows and the like, and all of the victims meet their fates in rather uninspired ways that belie the gleefully sadistic carnage that made this franchise what it is.While the finale is executed in a silly manner, the idea of returning Jason to the bottom of Crystal Lake is actually a pretty interesting one. Of course, we know he doesn't stay there, but there is a fitting full-circle feel to the conclusion, and if this had been the last entry in the series there would be something almost brilliant about that. But, you know, there's ultimately not.The whole movie seems to be built on the assumption that the words ""Friday The 13th"" in the title will guarantee a certain audience, no matter how relatively mediocre the actual film is. Jason Lives is certainly semi-enjoyable, but there's nothing here that suggests a kick-start to the fading franchise. I promise it gets better, but then it also gets far, far worse before it gets better again, so it's pretty much up to you to decide where you want to draw the line on the series.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
132,ryan-10075,"""So, what were you going to be when you grew up?""",7,10 December 2020,"Great and certainly the best opening to a Jason film we are given a FRANKENSTEIN-like beginning from writer/director Tom McLoughlin. Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews) and his buddy Allen Dawes (Ron Palillo) go to the Crystal Lake Cemetery or rather the Lake Forest Green Cemetery being renamed to erase any memory of Jason Vorhees. There Jason is brought back to life, but now he is much stronger as he is like a zombie. Tommy then goes to Sheriff Garris (David Kagen) who puts him in the slammer believing what he is hearing from the boy doesn't make any sense.No give or lulls in the action. In my opinion McLoughlin knew what the Jason fans wanted. My favourite Tommy Jarvis is Corey Feldman, but Matthews does a fine job as the older, more troubled Jarvis. They did sort of throw away certain elements of part V with Tommy like his need for meds and seeing Jason everywhere. In the end though you have to be ready to smirk at the story. Very meta, McLoughlin added more humour than any other Jason, and filled with some good laughs.Since Jason (this time played by C.J. Graham) is back there are lots of kills and much more senseless murders. Unfortunately, it also adds to much more senseless sequels as this is the Jason going forward. The lumbering, never running, very big, but also not near as scary Jason.If you felt dissatisfied with part V, I would say tune into this part as Jason is back and it is a really good return. One of the better entries in the series. Alice Cooper has 3 songs in the soundtrack including the title song ""He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)"".

133,Toronto85,Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives,6,16 March 2011,"Well, it's not as good as everyone says. Friday the 13th Part VI does resurrect Jason Vorhees, which is great. But this does not have the same feel of the first four films, or even the fifth for that matter. It is low budget like the rest, but it seems more sophisticated and humorous. Friday the 13th's aren't supposed to be funny and smart. They are supposed to be gritty, messy, gory horror fun. Something about this rubs me the wrong way. Anyways, the plot... Tommy Jarvis accidentally brings Jason to life while trying to dig up his body. Yeah. Eventually Jason starts killing some random people in the area and the keystone cops automatically blame Tommy. Meanwhile, a group of young camp counsellors are setting up for the kids. Jason of course attacks the camp killing some more people.Things I like about this one. I like that it goes back to it's roots with the camp setting. The first two were about camp counsellors paying with their lives for being ""negligent"". I like the spooky atmospheric scenes with the woods. And I like Thom Matthews as Tommy Jarvis. There's just something that is wrong about this one. It's over-hyped as one of the best Friday's, better than the first four according to some even. It doesn't have the feel of a Friday film. The two officers are the most annoying people in the franchise next to Ethel's screaming son on the motorcycle in Part 5. They continuously blame Tommy despite blatant evidence pointing to someone else. And they changed the name to Camp Forest Green? After reflecting a bit here, the biggest problem for me in this is Jason. I don't like ""Zombie Jason"" compared to ""human/backwoods"" Jason. He moves slow and everything just like a zombie. He was much scarier when he was a psychotic, disturbed human who could run after his victims. He isn't scary at all in this. There are some good parts like the creepy wooded scenery and that one kill where the counsellor gets pulled by Jason through the window. It's a step up from the fifth installment, but definitely not as good as many give it credit for.6/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
134,Mr_Censored,Jason Lives to stalk another day.,7,20 February 2009,"""Hey Nikki, what are ya doin' back there? Taking a dump?"" - CortSitting down on a Friday The 13th and attempting to sit through a marathon of ""Friday The 13th"" movies can be quite the arduous task. Not because they are bad films, per se, but because for the most part -- especially in regards to the first five films -- they work with a pretty well-worn formula that keeps each installment a little too familiar and too close to it's source material. Even as a horror fan who adores the franchise, it's easy to see how critics and pop-culture in general became disenfranchised with the series. All that changed for a moment, though, in 1986 with the sixth entry in the ongoing saga: ""Friday The 13th Part VI: Jason Lives.""As an attempt to break up the monotony, director Tom McLoughlin injects not only a campy sense of humor, but a bit of action, Gothic imagery, and 80's cheese to boot into his film. If the films that preceded it felt a bit redundant when viewed back to back, then ""Jason Lives"" serves as a refreshment. The kind of horror sequel that could only be born in the 1980's, it's full of highly-stylized, over-the-top death-scenes, an abundance of over-acting and plenty of self-referential humor, often breaking the fourth wall to let it's audience know that this film is a different monster (or zombie) than what came before. It's a film that's tailor-made for a built-in audience, for sure, but those who are up for a good time with old Jas-face will hardly leave disappointed.Thom Matthews (""Return Of The Living Dead"") portrays the troubled Tommy Jarvis in this film, returning to Camp Crystal Lake to make sure Jason is truly dead and buried. One thing leads to another, though, as Tommy and Horshack unwittingly revive the maggot infested corpse of Jason Vorhees, via electricity. Jason makes his return to camp -- now renamed Forest Green -- in hopes of stalking yet another batch of unsuspecting, fun-seeking teenagers. With the mind-set that only he can stop him, Tommy constantly butts heads with the town's sheriff, enjoys the lap of said-sheriff's daughter and breaks more than a handful of laws in an attempt to finally lay Jason to rest.Admittingly, the story is less engaging than previous films, but then again, this is meant to be a less-serious film, and it's the better for it. We don't dwell on Tommy's skeletons here, and the characters are colorful 80's clichés, portrayed by actors so bad that they are good. While it's death scenes are memorable (but cut heavily, as always) it's worth noting that the sex is played down quite considerably for this installment, with virtually no skin being bared. This was quite a change from the borderline pornographic ""A New Beginning"" but in no way hinders the genuine ""Friday The 13th"" feeling of the movie. Truth be told, it's still just as much fun as one would expect from a Jason flick, while being very witty and very well-made. It knows it's the sixth installment in an increasingly ridiculous franchise, and ""Jason Lives"" is by far and away one of the best trips to Camp Crystal Lake you could take.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

136,kingofdanerds,A great return for Jason,8,27 January 2021,"After the failure of Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning, Friday the 13th Part VI; Jason Lives was made in hopes that it would fix Part V's problems. It did for the most part. Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives was released in 1986. The film was once again a box office hit and even a critical success as it was the first Friday the 13th film to get any sort of critical praise from critics. Of course, the audiences loved it to and to this day has become a fan favorite. The film stars Thom Mathews (Return of the Living Dead I and II) and this time around the man behind the mask is C.J. Graham. In the director's chair we have Tom McLoughlin who also wrote the screenplay for this film. Tom McLoughlin has also directed the Stephen King TV Movie Sometime They Come Back, episodes of Friday the 13th: The Series and Freddy's Nightmares.Tommy Jarvis is still facing trauma from all of those years ago. (Note: This film does seem to retcon Part V). Not satisfied that Jason is dead, he and a friend go to Jason's grave and Tommy makes sure that Jason is dead. What he ends up doing is resurrecting Jason. So now Tommy has to put Jason to rest. But will anyone believe him when he tells that Jason is back?Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives is a unique film in the franchise and that is not a bad thing though it may seem that way at first. Instead of a dark and serious tone like the previous films, this film goes for a more lighthearted approach which does work fairly well in this film. Jason Voorhees is back in this film and this time around we see him as zombie-Jason which from here on out is what he will be like. Jason is much more powerful and is an absolute tank. He is fairly scary in his presence but his whole outfit is one thing that I never cared too much for. It is not that I don't hate it but compared to all of the other looks for Jason, this one ranks pretty low. I do not know if giving Jason a toolbelt and gloves is an interesting idea or anything. The kills in this film are very creative here but sadly a lot of it was cut due to the MPAA. There is not much that can be seen with the effects which is a shame as I do like looking at the effects of slasher films and deciding whether or not I like them. My only complaint is the fake blood used. To me, it looks too translucent and looks more like red slime. Other than that, I have no problem with the kills here in this film. The cinematography is really nice and this film looks like the cinematography had some sort of effort put into it. It looks well polished. Especially the climax which is different but still really good. It is one of my favorite in the franchise. It is something that just has to be seen. The tone has shifted in this film series from horror to horror-comedy which seems to be a good idea as to not make another stale horror film. The comedy in here is slapstick mostly with some fourth wall breaking. All of this is done really well. It gets a laugh out of me. Wanna hear Tommy hurl insults at Jason. You got it! The film succeeds in this area because that is what they were going for. Tommy Jarvis is the main focus of this film and so far me, the other characters are not as important. In my opinion, Tommy Jarvis in this film is a mixed bag. I think the performance is good. But as for character, this version of Tommy is probably the weakest in that area. He does not resemble anything that we have seen previously and that is also taking into account of the possibility that this film retcons Part V. Which if you think about it, perhaps the events of The Final Chapter did not have the same effect on Tommy in Part V as it is in Part VI. But to me, it is not very likely. Aside from all of that, Tommy does have a better outfit than Jason. The acting here is also pretty solid as well. The soundtrack is my personal favorite in the franchise. Not only do we have the regular music that is a common staple in this franchise but also some music that fits with the comedic tone. But more importantly is the Alice Cooper music. Now, I am not an avid Alice Cooper listener but I really dig the music here and it is really awesome.Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives for me and for many is the best film in the franchise because it does something a little different. Definitely give this one a watch.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
137,RhapsodyReviews,"Thank God, Jason Lives.",7,7 October 2019,"Review:
'Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives' is an American slasher film written and directed by Tom McLoughlin. It is the sixth installment in the 'Friday the 13th' film series. The premise for this movie sounds like the exact same thing on paper, but the writers really brought something new to this movie which I really didn't think was possible in the sixth film in a franchise. It also involved kids and throughout all the other films you didn't think anybody was safe from Jason, so that made for a creepy element of the film.
The film follows Jason Voorhees who, after being accidentally resurrected, stalks another group of camp counselors.
This movie starts a new era of acting. The actors in this movie are actually pretty good, however some of the dialogue they try and say does feel forced and campy at times, but these movies were very low budget and it didn't take me out of the experience as much as it would if the acting didn't hold up.
Jason feels like an unstoppable killing machine in this movie and that's what you want when you put in a 'Friday the 13th' movie. You don't want to see a guy in a hockey mask walking toward some running teenagers like some of the previous feels felt like. You want to see a giant beast of a man taking shot after shot, but still comes after you.
Overall, this film sparked a fire under the ass of this franchise. You will definitely have a great time watching this movie if you love slasher movies, monster movies or are just a fan of Jason himself.

138,DustinRahksi,"Ridiculous, but enjoyable.",5,16 February 2013,"This film is overly comedic, but feels more satisfying than part 5. Now at the beginning of this film I could tell something was wrong, Tommy is a completely different person, he is no longer quite and secluded. Not to mention what happened at the ending of part 5 somehow didn't get incorporated into this, I think they just chose to ignore part 5.This film is pretty over the top, with the writing and some of the deaths. One death has a guy getting his arm ripped off and then being flung into a tree, leaving a bloody smiley face imprint. There was a lot of pointless kills, but I'm not complaining. This film is one of the bloodiest in the series, there is a cabin actually painted in blood, that was awesome. There's a scene where a guy looks at the camera and starts talking to it. The film is treading old water with bringing back the camp counsellors. The final act at the camp looked absolutely beautiful, the woods, cabins, lighting, leaves falling, it all looked great. Great atmosphere during this part. There was one freaky part where Jason is looking through the window into the kids cabin, imagine if you actually saw that. My biggest complaint was the Tommy character, I prefer part 5's Tommy better. I also find it strange how the lead actress is so excited and cheery all the time.The film is enjoyable, I still think the first four parts were the best, but this one is pretty fun.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
139,FKDZ,Highly lacking in all departments,3,12 October 2020,"I have a hard time finding a lot of good things to say about this movie in general, its seems to hit that perfect mediocre and boring balance. Whilst there are more incompetent movies before this they at least could make you laugh.The few things that really let me down, and it was already a negative in the previous few were the ''side plot'' seemingly random kills just to get the numbers in I guess. It completely detaches you from the main plot, and from the very instant the scenes begin you know they are just there to be killed. Also the opening sequence is so slow, with some again weird decisions. I do like the way Jason looked right out of the grave, pretty damn scary but that didn't last for long nor was it used very well. It seemed like they never really wanted to get up close to his face because I'd look bad or something.Now another thing about that focus on the side plot is that we barely know any of the camp teenagers/staff. They might as well be some randoms visitors. No background, no interesting characteristics. Just nothing memorable about this movie.Now the most disappointing thing here is the kills, in a slasher, especially F13, the kills are where its at. But wow it's terrible here, most of it is heavily cut and censored which you can outright notice. And with that, all the kills are so lackluster and unsatisfying. There's no fun stuff like the previous movies like a machete to the face, or an exploding head (even though it look hilarious). In this movie it's all just very plain and played safe. If an unrated or whatever version exists I'd rate it higher but for this wide release version its very lackluster.Then Jason, he feels kinda off, the way he walks or is put on camera just doesn't really get that creepy vibe that it had in the previous movies. There are arguably some cool shots like Jason standing by the window looking at the kid. And him walking along with one of the counselors/camp staff. But aside from that there's not much.Now what really irked me was the final scene and the way Tommy decides to rid of Jason, honestly it's just a incredibly stupid idea/writing and the whole fight scene was extremely boring and overdone. But maybe this was also just my general mood against the film, I just wanted it to be over. Like really? Sit alone in a flimsy boat with a big rock and chain? Little kid Tommy Jarvis was smarter than that.It gets a 3/10 for me for being at least okay in a few departments like acting and directing.

144,hoernkeem,"Friday the 13th part VI: Jason Lives review (1986, Tom McLoughlin) Ridiculously cheesy still, but the best one of the best of the Friday bunch",4,1 April 2021,"Friday the 13th part VI: Jason Lives (1986, Tom McLoughlin)
This is the 6th outing in the Friday the 13th slasher series of films, and one of the most well received since the series' inception. Ultimately this is still very much a bad slasher film, but it does have a few inspired moments during the completely trashy, dated picture. After the atrocious misstep, even for a Friday the 13th movie, that was part V, this film immediately and definitively reestablishes Jason Voorhees as the antagonist of choice. There was an idea to reinvent Tommy Jarvis as the new antagonist, but part V was so poorly received that the idea was abandoned. It also puts us squarely back in the realm of camp counselors at Crystal Lake which is exactly what the Jason mythology demands. This is the third and last film to feature the character of Tommy Jarvis as the film's main protagonist. The script for all its flaws does do some very early meta humor and fourth wall breaking which sets it a bit apart from its cohorts in a positive way.Tommy Jarvis, played by Thom Matthews, is still haunted by the killer Jason and sneaks into a cemetery to dig up and completely destroy whatever is left of Jason's rotting carcass as a means of cathartic closure. Here is were we get one of the few references to the fact that Tommy was in a mental institution which is about the only acknowledgment of the events of the previous film. In this misguided endeavor Tommy inadvertently resurrects Jason. While it was kind of implied before this is the first time it is explicitly shown that Jason is an otherworldly, supernatural, superhuman killing force. Tommy is forced to flee and regroup as Jason recommences his single minded slaughter of everything human. Jason first stumbles across a couple lost on a back road where you get some meta humor as the girl driving the car references seeing enough movies not to get out of the car when confronted by a masked psycho standing in the road. The action centers around Camp Forest Green rechristened from Camp Crystal Lake aka Camp Blood. Young impressionable camp counselors have once again shown up with little to no memories of the horrors committed there. It is hilarious because it really seems like these young people have no business being counselors. They are more like a random group of friends they picked up at a beach party. Tommy runs to the sheriff in order to warn everyone and comes across like a raving lunatic. The sheriff's age appropriate daughter weirdly likes what she hears and, of course, she is one of the camp counselors so despite being thought crazy by the cops Tommy has aid he can enlist in his crusade against Jason. Despite Tommy's warnings the counselors are picked off one at a time along with the scant police force and a few others who just happen to be in the way setting up the final confrontation where Tommy once again gets the best of Jason consigning him to the depths of Crystal Lake, but for how long as we know Jason is only dispatched to be revived again for the next sequel.This film does have a few decent aspects to it, but that cannot disguise from the fact this is dated slasher silliness at its utmost with horrible acting and an equally bad script. Tommy sounds like an insane mental patient throughout, which he basically is, however, that is an odd position to put the film's protagonist in. All of the young adults are cannon fodder to be killed in abrupt and somewhat creative ways although they slyly avoid Jason confronting any of the children. I guess even this series isn't quite ready to hurdle that taboo. Just about all the characters continually make the most horrible decisions putting themselves and others in harms way.

145,Condemned-Soul,"After a slew of disappointing entries, 'Jason Lives' is a cracker",8,30 March 2020,"A real treat for those who stuck with the series up to this point, writer/director Tom McLoughlin creates a solid slasher that not only includes competent dialogue, but makes Jason a force to be reckoned with.Undead Jason is the best thing that could have happened to the series after a severe case of diminishing returns; he's a ruthless zombie wielding a machete and sporting his now-iconic hockey mask - and, incredibly, it works.The characters aren't obnoxious and are actually worthy of supporting in their terror (which is a first for the franchise) while the director also manages to get the best out of returning composer Harry Manfredini with an effective score.Overall, although the series should have ended here on a high note, 'Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives' proves an entertaining entry with a villain worth fearing again.8/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

147,shaun98,Not bad really,6,15 April 2002,"Believe it or not, the sixth entry in the long-running slasher series is actually a decent movie. The basic plot is pretty much the same, but it's better constructed than most films of this type. It's competently made, with some atmospheric photography, evoking some of the eeriness of 1930's horror.Refusing to take itself seriously, ""Jason Lives"" displays a healthy, refreshing sense of humor. In-jokes and sly digs at the slasher genre abound. Notice the line, ""I've seen enough horror movies not to trust a guy in a funny mask."" Or the self-reflexive wink at the ancient cliché of vehicle engines stalling at the worst possible time. There's even a Bond spoof, probably the funniest bit in the movie. Of course, this being a slasher, it couldn't do without the expected gore scenes and shock moments. I freely admit I actually jumped a few times. Some of the gore effects are pretty good, although it's obvious when they were cut at the MPAA's behest. The climax is fairly effective, and for a moment I actually wondered if Tommy Jarvis would survive.Despite my praises, this isn't really a ""good"" movie, at least not in the conventional sense. The plot is still pretty thin, and the supporting characters are as annoying and disposable as ever. Still, it's worth a rental for horror fans.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

150,TheMovieDoctorful,The Golden Standard For 80s Slashers,10,18 May 2015,"While I've made my opinions on the superiority of 90s Horror over 80s Horror quite clear in my review of The Faculty, I'll always have a deep love for the Friday the 13th franchise. If 80s Horror gave me anything, it was Tetsuo: The Iron Man, An American Werewolf in London and this. Admittedly, the Friday the 13th franchise does have some pretty bad entries, but it's better and stronger entries can work as horror films, satirical self parody, and even surprisingly good character study. With that being said, Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI is not only the best film of the Friday the 13th series, but the best slasher movie pre-1992.This movie makes the brilliant decision of taking a more satirical, comedic tone rather than take itself 100% seriously, and it's a smarter film for it. The dialogue, the behavior of many of the characters and even some of the kills give off the impression that this movie knows the clichés of the genre, and it chooses to subvert them rather than repeat them. This, rather than merely repeating genre cliches and conventions with the tepid and half hearted excuse of ""lol irony"", is the key to truly great Horror comedy. Jason Lives walked so that Scream could run.The acting is phenomenal from all involved, easily the best the series has had to offer. Thom Matthews is an extremely likable and compelling lead as Tommy Jarvis. He gives a touch of insanity to the character of Tommy Jarvis, and makes the wise decision of making him a good combination of fearful and emotionally fragile yet heroic and proactive in his mission to save Camp Crystal Lake from the notorious Jason Voorhees (Who is more evil than ever in this installment, even threatening the lives of children attending Camp Crystal Lake for Summer break) Tommy's arc from the weak, scared victim of The Final Chapter to the courageous, self-sacrificing, noble hero of Jason Lives is told phenomenally, almost like Luke Skywalker's transition from naive farm boy to Jedi Knight in the original Star Wars trilogy. It took 3 films for Tommy to finally face his fears, but in Jason Lives, he is finally prepared, and it's pretty badass. Jennifer Cooke does a fantastic job as Megan, creating an extremely charismatic, likable character. She's just as proactive and courageous as Tommy and arguably more intelligent and an even better leader. David Kagen does an excellent turn as Megan's father Sheriff Garess, giving off an intimidating yet still tongue and cheek performance that fits this movie's tone perfectly. In fact, almost all of the characters here are fairly likable and easy to root for. None of the teenagers are people who I want to get killed, they're all good people and that makes for a more tense and investing ride.Jason Lives also features some of the best kills of the entire franchise. Thom Matthews puts more of an emphasis on the supernatural nature of Jason's character here, (This is the first of the ""zombie Jason"" movies, where Jason is an actual monster/zombie rather than just a psychotic and murderous deformed human) which leads to some creative and EXTREMELY entertaining kills. Jason is at his most fun to watch here; decapitating 3 people in a single blow, flipping over trucks, twisting people's heads 360 degrees around. The death scenes here are extremely memorable.The atmosphere here is phenomenal, without a doubt the best I've ever seen and probably ever will see in a slasher movie. It truly feels like something straight out of the Universal Monster movies or Hammer Monster Films, complete with foggy moors and graveyards and lightning clashes. Even Jason's intro into the movie, where he is resurrected via a lightning bolt to the chest, feels like something out of a Frankenstein flick. This is helped by a very creepy and tense score by Harry Manfredini.This right here is by far the definitive Jason movie, if not slasher movie of the 80s. The acting is fantastic, the characters are likable, the kills are insanely fun to watch, the atmosphere is, dare I say, beautiful. I really can't find anything bad to say about it.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
151,RobertF87,"One of the Better of the ""Friday the 13th"" Films",5,27 March 2006,"This is probably one of the best of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Revolving around recurring character Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews) and his attempts to convince the police of Crystal Lake (now renamed Forest Green) that psychopath Jason Voorhees has been resurrected as some kind of zombie, the film never pretends to take itself seriously.In fact the intentional humour is the films saving grace, as the series' trademark gore and nudity have been significantly toned down in this instalment, which makes it less of a guilty pleasure. However, despite the weakness of Matthews in the lead role, most of the teenagers are surprisingly sympathetic and likable, which makes a change.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
152,nick121235,Too undecided about what it wants to be,6,19 October 2016,"The weakest edition to the series since Part II. Friday the 13th has always been campy, and the previous installment, A New Beginning, introduced overt comedy to the films. Jason Lives tries to continue with the humor aspect while re-introducing the original killer and Camp Crystal Lake setting, but it just doesn't seem to work this time around. Friday the 13th is fun because it's already humorous, it knows it, but it doesn't bring it to the forefront, more often opting for a nod and a smile as it plays straight into the horror trope. Jason Lives revs the humor from Part V up a notch- into the realm of self referential and meta-humor, anticipating the wave of films that would follow Wes Craven's Scream almost exactly a decade later. But the effort is too weak, never really giving us a strong delivery in that field, always wavering on the edge of the Modern and Post- modern. And it gives us this half-hearted effort in lieu of the traditional elements of the Friday the 13th series- namely a strong atmosphere and baroque set and visual storytelling style. If you're not a completist I doubt you'll have made it this far, and so I doubt you'll be willing to skip, but this is just my two cents- that Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives is the weakest entry in the series up to this point and if you can bear it, go from Part V to Part VII- both great examples of movies with great atmosphere.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
153,chucknorrisfacts,"One of the better ""Friday"" films...",4,19 October 2007,"Okay, so this movie isn't great, but it's one of the better ""Friday"" films. It has a character named Tommy Jarvis, first established in ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"", the fourth film in the series, visit Jason's grave at Forest Green cemetery (formerly known as Crystal Lake cemetery) and there he inadvertently resurrects Jason and spends the duration of the film trying to put a stop to him once and for all.Camp Crystal Lake evidently has been renamed Camp Forest Green, most likely in an attempt to distance itself from its murderous reputation, but it makes no difference as Jason starts killing off more camp counselors, one by one. Don't these people ever learn? The ending is actually pretty good, and it almost makes sense that Jason would be stopped by being tied to a boulder and sunk to the bottom of the lake. The same lake he drowned in as a boy all those years ago. The problem is we have seen Jason wade his way through the water in previous films, which they shouldn't have done.The filmmakers should have left water his weakness, in ""Freddy versus Jason"" they claim it is, he even appears deathly afraid of it, but yet any viewing of ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" would show he can make his way pretty far out into the lake to kill a young woman on a flotation device without him drowning. Water should be his weakness; the hard part should be luring him out into the water.Anyway, I'd say this movie is worth the rental, it is one of the better ""Friday"" sequels.

155,jed-estes,A Film To Live By 5,10,16 August 2006,"Ha, Ha! I wish this was all I had to write about this film because those two words explain the film thoroughly. This is a hilarious comedy under the charade of a horror disguise. After the mess that was The New Beginning Jason had to evolve if he was to survive in the late eighties and a comedy was the best way to ensure this. All of the horror element beats are replaced with side splitting punch lines. Tom McLogoulin new exactly what he was doing. Seeing his previous horror effort One Dark Night shows that he can mix comedy and splatter together in a refined meeting of greatness. This film is one of the best in the series just because it's different. All the films before this and after take themselves seriously but this does not and it is magic. I would be afraid to see what a director would do with this style today. They would probably take an opportunity to make fun of the fans. But when this was made it was chance for the fans to laugh with the film, not be laughed at and that is what the studios are missing today. Only a couple of the Scary Movie films have marginally reached what this film did in black comedy. I love this movie and I love the guy who plays Jason in it. C.J Grahme is a master in the suit, though not the best (Kane Hodder holds that title) Grahme still rocks the man behind the mask out in this installment. I hope he returns to the role someday. The music in this one is the best in the series. Alice Copper did the soundtrack and his theme song ""The Man Behind The Mask"" is the standard by which all other Jason soundtracks should be judged.

Unfortunate campers are mince meat for the notorious serial killer who stalks the grounds of camp Crystal Lake, and Paramount pictures is once again able to capitalize on the never ending pre-adolescent fascination with graphic murder and heartless retribution. This entry in the series was probably our most favorite due to several factors that set it apart from the others. 1986 was the year, and its predecessor ""A New Beginning"" was somewhat of a disappointment for fans due to an unexpected twist in the storyline (the killer was not Jason, but a vengeful paramedic??) This time Jason is back, and there can be no doubts to his identity.Our story starts off as Tommy Jarvis, (now a grown adult) is unsatisfied with the fact that Jason is gone for good, so he returns to his grave to ""finish the job"" which results from a lightning strike that apparently resurrects the maggot ridden zombie Jason making him stronger and more ticked off than ever. Now, Tommy (played by Thom Mathews of ""Return of The Living Dead"") must prove Jason's existence and clear his name with the help of the Sheriff's likable pretty daughter all while Jason's angry corpse violently disposes of sex-starved vacationers, weekend warriors, lawmen and passers-through alike.This has an exciting and fun opening sequence including an excellent beginning credits James Bond-like montage, good cast that has fun with it, innovative killings, and a twisted sense of humor. C.J. Graham's Jason is a good one and a sympathetic lead role and satisfying climax make this a worthy sequel. Highlights include: fist through the gut, impalement by iron shank, arm ripped off, triple machete slice, broken bottle through throat, double machete stabbing, face through wall, Rambo knife through skull, neck snapping, dart through forehead, crushed skull, and a cop broken in half...""Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment"".",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

162,The-Last-Prydonian,Jason Lives proves to be a fitting title as Tom Mcloughlin reinvigorates the franchise,6,1 July 2017,"The sixth in producer Sean S. Cunningham's humdrum horror franchise, the fifth sequel which would have seemed like a somewhat pointless venture, as it has increasingly just become an excuse to milk as much out of the Friday the 13th cash cow for all it's worth. However with Jason Lives, a title which is something of a contradiction in terms given the context of the story, the series went in something of a new direction as there was a divergence in to supernatural territory. It also adopted a more comedic tone with writer/director Tom McLoughlin taking up the reigns. With the psychotic, hockey masked mummy's boy lying peacefully in his grave after coming to a an unceremonious end at the end of The Final Chapter (a moniker that would prove to be an ironic misnomer), Tommy Jarvis, (Thom Matthews) the troubled hero of Jason Lives, and who was the young boy survivor of that film who's character was again, seen in the lacklustre A New Beginning, can't put Jason to rest in his mind. Determined to do so he breaks out of the mental institution where he has been residing with fellow patient Allen Hawed (Ron Palillo) to exhume the killers grave and burn his maggot infested corpse to cinders. Of course things don't go quite according to plan when Tommy, who upon clasping eyes on Jason's decomposing remains stabs it with a metal fence post after snapping and briefly losing his composure. What follows is a tremendously silly resurrection scene as a bolt of lightning strikes the metal fence post, still embedded in the lifeless body and reanimates the murderous behemoth. Tommy manages to evade Jason while Allen proves not to be quite so lucky. Donning his iconic hockey masked, the newly zombified killer sets off for Camp Crystal Lake, which has been renamed Forest Green with an inevitable blood bath and a showdown between Tommy and his old nemesis on the cards.From the offset, it would be quite easy to mistake Jason Lives as just another generic slasher movie in a franchise which had already ran out of steam by the time it's fifth instalment had come along. Although quite frankly, the first movie was nothing more than a poor man's Halloween and it's sequels flat out mundane. Thankfully however, while not a classic of it's genre but any stretch of the imagination, this outing manages to stand out among the rest. Silly and dumb though the film is, it's more knowing in this regard and Tom McLoughlin who directed as well as wrote the screenplay treats the material with more affectionate irreverence. It's dumb and silly but it's blatantly so that he's winking at the audience from behind the camera. I'd go so far as to say that as it stands, it could be seen as a precursor to Wes Craven's Scream Movies. The story itself is of course standard fare and the means of Jason's rising from the grave is downright ridiculous, and owes some kind of of a debt to the Frankenstein story. Jason after all is a lumbering monster in a similar vein to Mary Shelly's iconic antagonist. There's also some stupid plot twists with the actions of the movies main heroine investing too much trust in a short amount of time in the movies frantic hero. The Sheriff is also your hackneyed obstacle (who is also conveniently the father of the lead female) who typically doesn't heed the main protagonists warnings and eventually suspects him as being the killer. As for the overall standard of the acting, they're solid enough although ropy at times but then I wasn't exactly expecting Academy Award winning quality here, and it could have been worse than it actually is. Never the less, if you leave your brain behind and just go with it, it's not bad fun and there's some innovative kill scenes. Yes, the scene with the executive paint-ballers is too comedic and clownish and is out of sync with the whole tone of the rest of the movie, while the fact that none of the kids under the care of the camp counsellors miraculously go unharmed is unconvincing, but this is still watchable undemanding fodder which while not a class of it's genre makes for a passable enough way to waste an hour and a half of your time. Plus it has the added bonus of that thumping good theme tune performed by Alice Cooper",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
163,Lando_Hass,Easily one of the best Friday the 13th films out there....,9,24 October 2002,"As many people may know, all the Friday the 13th movies have done extremely well up to part 5, but after that, the series started to do poor at the box office. Not one Friday the 13th film has made over 40 million dollars, but came awfully close to the 40 million mark. In my opinion, Friday the 13th Part 5 ruined the series' reputation. However, though Friday the 13th Part 5 sucked badly, Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives actually delivers the goods. The only thing that makes this film different from the other Friday movies, is the fact that this one doesn't have ANY nudity, or sex scenes whatsoever. Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives delivers some mediocre acting, some of the actors did a good job, and some didn't. Sheriff Michael Garris (played by actor David Kagen (I)) is one of the main characters father. He believes that Tommy Jarvis is just a little insane in the head, due to the fact that Jason murdered his family. David Kagen (I)gave a really bad performance to say the least. In one scene, his daughter Megan (played by actress Jennifer Cooke (I)) asks her father when one of the murders occurred. He says a specific time, but he says it terribly. However, Thom Mathews does give a great performance as Tommy Jarvis. Another improvement from the the 5th and 4th installment was the fact that the character Tommy Jarvis has changed, he is no longer the bumbling geek he once was. In the first Friday film, is was a straight slasher. The plot that applies to Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, deals with more of a supernatural nature. Here's the story to this installment: Tommy Jarvis has finally been released from the asylum. One night, he plans on sending Jason to hell once and for all. He digs up Jason's grave, and attempts to set it on fire. Once he opens the coffin, pure hatred fills his body. He runs to the entrance to the cemetary, grabs a VERY sharp bar, and continuously stabs Jason's dead body. The mistake he made was leaving the bar jammed into Jason's stomach. When Tommy gets out of the hole, he grabs the gasoline. Before he could even get close to the grave, lightning hits the metal bar that was jammed into Jason's body. The electricity runs through Jason's body, and resurrects him. That's when the killings begin. There is merely nothing wrong with the plot, I in fact think that its cool, but some Friday the 13th fans might not like it. The make-up, and gore effects are still in the movie. Jason is cool and all, but I didn't like his make-up, or his mask. The actor who they got to play Jason (C.J. Graham) was a little to small for the part of Jason, I mean, the mask was bigger then his head. I thought that Jason's suit could have been a little bit better too, but who cares. When you look past all the flaws that Friday the 13th part 6 has, you will probably find an overall entertaining movie. After seeing Jason X, I realize that Jason wasn't all that powerful in this installment to the series. Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives deserves the high score of a 9 out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
164,legendaryunderdog,What was Tommy Jarvis thinking?,7,27 September 2007,"Of all the Friday movies this one is a tough pill to swallow. Tommy Jarvis has had a tough time coping with the fact that he killed Jason in the Final Chapter (part 4). For some reason he feels it would be best if he went to the cemetery where Jason's buried and dig up his corpse in order to cremate it and end his painful memories of long ago. Like always, things go awry and good ol' Jason comes back to life and the carnage ensues from there. This movie is a little better than the others surrounding it (part 5 new beginning and part 7 new blood) but it still lacks real good acting characters (with the exception of Thom Mathews, who played Tommy very well). Otherwise it's just another cheesy teen sex-slasher-splatterkill Friday installment, although I must say that Jason is very creepy in this installment. I do recommend this movie to slasher fans galore but don't expect a boatload of good acting and huge scares. Overall the movie is pretty decent. Watch for Horshack (Ron Palillo) from Welcome back Kotter as Tommy's friend in the beginning of the movie.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

This isn't that bad really.  The beginning with the part on how Jason comes back to life is really great and just goes to show how stupid people can be. I'm not going to ruin it due to the fact that many other people already wrote it down under their summary so why bother wasting your time.  Some other good parts are the paint ball scene where Jason kills some people who work together while playing paint ball and getting some anger out; a scene where a couple is in a Volkswagen bug and the lady says, ""Darren we need to stop and turn around. I've seen enough horror movies to know that anybody wearing a hockey mask with an ax is not good.""  Of course they get killed in gruesome ways.  I liked how they actually had kids as campers in this movie. All the other Friday movies just showed the teens getting the camp ready, but never any kids. I mean Jason actually went into the cabin and a little girl woke up, she closed her eyes, said a prayer, and when she opened her eyes Jason was gone. Then the little girl looked under the bed just to make sure he wasn't hiding.  I also liked the female character,which just happened to be the sheriff's daughter,  Jennifer Cooke.

166,Colbridge,Lighter in tone Tom McLoughlin attempts a crowd pleasing entry but it dumbs down the franchise,4,9 November 2021,"Part 6 is almost a parody of itself in Tom McLoughlin's lighter take on Friday the 13th as he introduces more humour, restrained gore and no nudity in comparison to the previous movies.From the ridiculous premise of Jason being resurrected by a bolt of lightning (a nod to Frankenstein's monster perhaps) to the James Bond style opening you know from the outset that this is not to be taken too seriously and that we should all just sit back, roll with it and have a good time. For me this was the wrong road to go down and only serves to cheapen the franchise.After reluctantly green lighting a new movie based on how well the previous instalment did at the box office, it seems Paramount Pictures finally acknowledged by the mid-80's that there was a huge worldwide fan base out there and turned a low budget slasher series they hoped would go away into a mainstream annual entertainment event, with this chapter being the most accessible to a wider audience with it's comedic tone, less sadistic kills and turning Jason into an iconic, hockey mask wearing brand.Jason Lives is therefore in sharp contrast to the sleazier, darker tone of Friday the 13th Part 5: A New Beginning (1985) and almost ignores it's existence accept for bringing back the adult Tommy character, played by another actor, and tries to be more of a crowd pleaser with sight gags and raucous Alice Cooper rock songs. It feels like it was designed for inviting your friends around for a few beers and having a good time, whether you're into horror or not, rather than staying true to the original.McLoughlin is consciously making amends here for the criticism of Part 5 that upset many fans because it didn't actually have Jason as the killer in it but, guess what, neither did Part 1. For me Part 5 works better than Part 6 but if you want a dumbed down Friday the 13th then this one is for you.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

168,boondocksaint20,The best of the series,7,14 June 2001,"I grew up fearing these movies in the 80's, but now in college, they've developed cult status galore.  All of the films are obviously low budget films with horrible acting and very little style or panache to fill in the gaps between deaths.  But we all know what kind of movie this is before we watch it anyway...we watch these movies because, let's admit it folks, cheap scares and a high body count that we all find ourselves counting provides us with wonderful entertainment.  This one is actually well done in my opinion. It has good horror elements and plays off the comic relief well, though, maybe a little too much so.  This is one of those popcorn munching films you have to rent with a room filled with people just so you can laugh at it's stupidity...but the great thing about this film is that it succeeds in letting the viewer know that it is making fun of itself.  After part five (which I will say wasn't as bad as most people say it was, but by no means was a GOOD movie at all either), the producers needed to revitalize the series, and they did so successfully.  For anyone checking the Friday films, definitely get the first one first, but the order in best to worst of the series is 6,4,1,7,3,2,5,8,9.  Definitely worth the 99 cents it costs to rent this slasher flick.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

He digs up the grave and stabs Jasons corpse with a fence pole multiple times. All of a sudden a lightning bolt hits the pole and brings Jason back to life, putting on the hockey mask and reeking terror at Camp Crystal Lake ounce more!Before Jason Lives, Jason was a human being. When he was killed in the Final Chapter, he was forgotten in the next sequel because he was still in the grave. Now this film brings to life the Jason we all know, the zombie Jason with the moldy face and rotting flesh with blood everywhere and such. This seems to be the last good Friday the 13th film till Freddy Vs. Jason came along. In this film, Jason is played greatly by a good actor. Jason now has a tool belt and gardening gloves, gay?, and his old hockey mask that Tommy drops the mask into the grave. Jason brings the slaughter back with chopping heads, snapping bones, crushing faces, and putting his arms into peoples chest. The plot is the same, Jason is alive and wants to kill, the acting is good, and the film is bloody with the usual Friday the 13th affects. Good film, 7 out of ten.

Part 6 is one of the best.  Tommy makes a good hero, the storyline is well-paced and entertaining and there are a multitude of interesting characters rather than just brainless teenagers (although there are a few of those).

I can enjoy all of these slasher movies, but this is the one that pleases me the most. There is a lot of gore and a killer soundtrack with music by Alice Cooper. Thom Matthews (of Return of the Living Dead fame) makes a memorable performance as a grown-up Tommy Jarvis (from parts 4 & 5). The death sequences are intense and unique. I really like the characters Sissy and Paula (you actually feel sorry for them when they get knocked off). I especially like the fact that this time there are actually young kids at the summer camp. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie. A+",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Part 5 to me only maintained 1 level of truth and that was Tommy Jarvis at the edge of sanity forced to the brink to find out Jason's true demise. The first 15 minutes of part 6 is my favourite of the series. The killings are all top notch and Jason's zombie like persona was able to make the killings become extremely innovative. Unfortunately this was the first outing where the MPAA started to really hone in on the violence in this series and the gore level here is diminished significantly. In fact compared to today's standards this is pg-13 to 14a level of violence. Alice Cooper soundtrack is just awesome and the acting better than usual.,Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

He killed Jason Vorhees, the mass murderer who terrorised the residents of Crystal Lake. But now, years later, Tommy is tormented by the fear that maybe Jason isn't dead. So Tommy and a friend go to the cemetery to dig up Jason's grave. Unfortunately, instead of finding a rotting corpse, they discover a well rested Jason who comes back from the dead for another bloody rampage in Friday THE 13th PART 6:JASON LIVES!This film starred: Thom Matthews, Jennifer Cooke & David Kagen.In my opinion, this wasn't the best entry in the Friday the 13th saga and out of the first 6 it was probably the worst. Tommy Jarvis was a completely changed character from the 5th film to this one. As in the 5th film he was scared, haunted by Jason scared of him, but in this one he taunts Jason when they are face to face and doesn't seem scared of him and just ants him dead as he is an enemy to Tommy.

I didn't think any of the acting in this movie was any of the best, but enough to get by. The paced sort of lagged a bit at times. By this movie Jason is an established killer so everybody's expecting him to do his job. A little comedy here and there was not needed to the story, but somehow still wound up being put in the movie.

180,Skeletors_Hood,The Mask is Back,9,18 September 2001,"Okay, here we go.  This is perhaps the best Friday film made.  It portrayed Jason as a force to be reckoned with, and who is here to stay.  After part V, we NEEDED VI, just to give us faith in the hockey mask again.The only thing wrong with V was the lack of Jason, which was a bad move on Paramount's part.  Granted, they were trying a new slasher for the film, even trying to make Tommy, the Corey Feldman character from part IV, the role of slasher, but that just didn't cut it with the fans. Now, Jason's back where he belongs, and this is the first movie of where the Friday series where things start to get great.  For one thing, Jason is scarier now, because he no longer needs to worry about bodily harm, therefore making him unstoppable.  The soundtrack has just the right tweaks to make it chilling, and the loop in the story about Tommy being the killer made this more than just the typical slasher movie, but giving it a subplot, and believable characters.  AND we finally get to see something that camp Crystal Lake never had in the movies...KIDS!  Helps make things believable, and the scene where Jason looks at the little girl in the cabin, without making a move to harm her it just wonderful, showing that maybe he isn't as cold hearted as people think, or that he really is just a boy inside a man's body.A great movie in many ways, and I love it...to death!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
181,pleiades10,The title says it all...,5,30 August 2000,"Yep... After being brutally killed in self defense at the conclusion of the ""Final Chapter (Part 4)"", and existing only as a haunting image in the ""New Beginning (Part 5)"", Jason comes back. But at least something HAPPENS to make him come back... he doesn't just crawl out of the grave on his own. Tommy Jarvis, the hero of the previous two installments, goes to visit Jason's grave, to make sure he's dead and gone. He gets the shovel, and... whoops! almost slipped into SPOILER territory! Let's just say that Jason gets a charge from life in this scene!Tommy witnesses Voorhees' resurrection, and tries to alert the authorities, who won't listen, because it's common knowledge that Jason is dead. So, unencumbered by the lawman, Jason sets out to do what he does best, slaughter teens (and a few adults for good measure as well.)This movie does not take itself seriously, from the James Bond spoof opening, to the comments made by the kids actually attending the camp, to the graveyard worker who looks at the open grave and says... well I don't want to spoil it, but it is clever and funny. The finale is also rather cool, and the soundtrack by Alice Cooper certainly kicks things up a notch.A recommended entry in a series that was really showing it's age by this time.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
182,jhigginbotham151,Really enjoyable installment.,7,10 May 2014,"I really enjoyed this installment, it had everything I had wanted. It isn't your standard, straight up horror/slasher film, its a slasher with some some personality, some dry humour, its also entertaining as all hell, unlike most slashers.Jason is brought back like the Frankenstein monster (cool reference)by Tommy and from there he goes on a big killing spree (not much different I know), but this time he's a bit more serious, a bit scarier actually, the kills don't have the same over the top factor they used to, its no Jason X thats for sure but I like how they brought back a more serious Jason and the fact this Jason isn't as bulky as Kane Hodder is, it makes him a little more unsuspecting, even more frightening in my opinion.The characters are really great in this one. The two cops, Jason, Megan, all memorable characters with memorable personalities. Yes, we still have the classic throw-away 'kill me now' characters for Jason to slaughter at his own pace but the main characters we genuinely don't want to see get turned to mush.The humour is really off beat, the one-liners of the cops, the bitchy yet good hearted attitude of Megan and some of the kills are hilarious. The kind of 'in on it' humour is also used to good effect, giving the film a slight meta vibe.But like I said, Jason ain't no clown in this one. There's a moment where he slowly gets closer to a scared child and you are genuinely scared for her.Overall, since i'm working my way backwards here, Jason Lives is the best in the series since Jason X, although for different reasons. Definitely check it out.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

The bodycount is still pretty disappointing, landing somewhere around 15, the gore is almost non-existent, the plot is as weak as you might expect and for once there's not even any boobs to be seen.The beginning is about the only thing in this movie that doesn't make you fall asleep, mainly because of some stupid gags and a particularly funny James Bond imitation by Jason.Otherwise this is as boring as a horror movie can get.2/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

To see what I mean check out the paint ball party scene, i have never laughed so much at a Friday the 13th movie as much as I laughed at this. The laughs are intentionally put in and they work well.

Anyway, part 6 is interesting in that there is a final battle between Jason and Tommy, and that the coming back of Jason was done in the graveyard. (It gives a more descriptive, more literal explanation of Jason's return, at last.) Also, this is the first film that they decide to make the characters try to forget Jason for good, by pretending he doesn't exist and never did.This one does, however, have it's faults, but I suppose that's to expected.

192,Kelly G.,An unexpected highpoint in the series.,7,17 March 1999,"Even though I've been rather tolerant of the ""Friday"" series, parts 4 and 5 were so lame I'd almost given up. I'm glad I kept going, because I would have missed this fun entry.Since virtually all of the ""Friday"" films have the same plots, characters, sets, e.t.c, it's kind of difficult to pinpoint the exact elements that make one film good, and another one bad. That's probably the reason why fans of this series can argue for days about which films are good and bad. The factors that make this watchable are VERY subtle.First, there's the opening bit, the old ""evil monster gets resurrected in the spooky graveyard amidst a raging thunderstorm"" gambit. Just seeing the main character digging up Jason's grave as the rain and lightning crashes around him, I felt a warm glow inside.And unlike the last film where the humor was needlessly mean-spirited and was focused on the gross main characters (it was kind of like Jason killing the cast of ""Police Academy""), here the humor is not as cheap, dealing instead with the concept of the film. I found myself chuckling through the majority of this as Jason pretty much has a fun time dispatching the ALMOST likeable characters.If you've never seen one of these films, I would recommend you start here, as it's fun. Although you'll probably start at the beginning and work your way up. God help you.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
193,Celluloid_Fiend,This Is Where The Story Should Have Ended!,6,28 February 2019,"As one of the longest running horror franchise in movie history, there really isn't much left up the sleeve of the ""Friday the 13th"" series to scare us with by the sixth installment. So, they decided to focus less on horror and a little more of fun. The results are not too bad, as far as sequels go.Determined to make sure Jason is dead once and for all, Tommy Jarvis (played by Thom Mathews) digs up his body with the intent to cremate him. Instead, he accidentally reanimates Jason and the killing spree begins again. Can Tommy stop the now-undead murder machine, or will the local Sheriff (played by David Kegan) and a town that wants to move on from the horrors of Jason Voorhees end up getting him, along with all of them, killed in the process?Right off the bat, if you are expecting straight-on horror from this outing, you are sure to be disappointed. Writer/Director Tom McLoughlin opts to take things a bit less serious than past chapters of this saga have been, adding in an element of humor to the mix and toning down on the graphic gore (although, personally, I think we could have used a little bit more of the latter). It's a formula he would use in many of the horror works he'd do after this, for both the big screen and the small one. While in less capable hands such things usually become a train wreck, McLoughlin never lets the humor stray too far into goofy slapstick and utter parody. There are a few of the in-jokes and camera mugging moments that are groan worthy, but overall the humor never totally overpowers the more horrific aspects of the film, as has happened in other attempts like this.The cast, which is mostly a ""who's who"" of television roles, does an overall solid job with the material they are given, with Thom Mathews and David Kegan the real standouts. Mathews does a great job of making you feel for Tommy's plight, while Kegan's sheriff is a great foil to Tommy. Jennifer Cooke (who fans of the 80's television series ""V"" will remember) is sexy, but never in a trampy way. In fact, there wasn't really anything in the way of nudity in this film, unlike so many others of its kind, but I never even missed it, as I was just having a lot of fun watching things unfold.In a lot of ways ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" was one of the earliest films that help to bridge the gulf between horror and humor, that many others would follow for the next couple of decades. And while those efforts are certainly a mixed bag, I think they made it work well enough here to make an enjoyable little popcorn horror-comedy, provided you don't think about the actual plot too much. Die-hards of straight-laced horror and gore, as well as this saga's previous chapters, will probably not find this film to their tastes. But for horror buffs who can take their scares a little less seriously, this film is a great way to kill an hour and a half and have some fun doing it. It's a fairly enjoyable sequel to this franchise and certainly a decent horror-comedy in its own right.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

195,Duzniak38,An Average Installment...,10,3 August 2006,"Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives is a good instalment, which goes back to the roots of what the Friday the 13th series is all about. However, this is so similar to some of the predecessors that it practically recycles parts of the story and plot. That aside, Friday the 13th Part VI does deliver the gory goods and also provides plenty of black humour, which opens instantly, with a James Bond parody in the opening credits. Inventine gore and death is once again present in this sequel, ranging from a triple decapitation to somebody head being smashed into the metal side of an RV. Part VI does contain some of the least interesting characters out of the series, in my opinion, save the paint-ballers maybe. Scenes alternates from where they take place; the woods, the lake, the cabins, in a motor home, in broad daylight and in the dark. This variation provides interest because we see and feel that Jason can still get you in the middle of the day. The script is what you would expect, pretty average. The acting is on good form, especially from Jennifer Cooke. Jason does indeed live, but this premise certainly isn't the most liveliest.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

First the comedic aspects mixed with the general Jason flare built up over the last few films, excluding the first and fifth makes this film stand out the most. The next reason is zombie Jason's debut in this film, which is also a fan favorite in the series. I also feel like this film and the final chapter have the most rewatchability due to final chapter having some of the best effects in the series and an at least coherent plot, this one is the most rewatchable because of the campy comedy used throughout as well as some generally interesting characters including Tommy Jarvis and the sheriff in this film.

What happens is a disaster! When Jason is brought back to life, he begins his reign of terror on the familiar grounds of Camp Crystal Lake, now renamed Camp Forest Green.

When Jason walks out ala James Bond, you know that the movie isn't going to take itself seriously and lets the audience laugh along with the screams, as it borders parody at times, but keeping with the true spirit of the series.

208,Zombie-Kermit,Probably My Favourite of the Series.,7,16 June 2008,"God, this is a great mindless horror movie. This seems to be the part of the series where they just decided ""Look, people don't watch these movies to be scared anymore, they watch them to see Jason cause carnage."" So what do they do? Well for the most part they forget about the type of scenes where they hear a noise, and it turns out to be a cat or something like that. Then they throw in a bunch of corny humour, and last but certainly not least, bring back our man Jason and throw all his limitations out the window. Sounds like the perfect recipe to me.Yes, it has the most ridiculous plot so far in the movie, (Remind me to write in my will that before burying me, I want my family to have me struck by lightning a few times and see if that helps) but who really cares? It's all part of the fun. It was offering something new to the series. As much as I love the other movies, most of them were all pretty similar in terms of plot, with characters that were hard to distinguish from one another, to me anyway. Sure the movies were all different in a couple of ways, but they still had a fair few similarities. Bunch of teens in a secluded area getting picked off one by one. Sure Jason Lives sort of has that, but it's a much smaller part of the movie. A New Beginning tried something new, but it didn't really pay off for them. The thing about the other movies were they were essentially about the killer taking out the people for most the movie. The minor exception to that rule was The Final Chapter, which contained some awareness to the situation, but even that came under that profile for the most part. Jason Lives seems to focus more on the fight against Jason. There are characters who know what he is doing from the start.Another thing I like about the movie is the fact that the kills seem a lot cooler to me. Normally you would just see characters see Jason, have a scared look on their face and get killed. Or a character killed so fast they probably wouldn't even realise that they are being killed. It's not a major problem but it wasn't really what I wanted to see every time. Now scenes in the range of someone firing rounds of shotgun shells into Jason is more like it. The movie has removed a fair few of the Friday the 13th series, such as bare breasts and drug use. It seems like they really wanted to offer the fans something new, and I feel that they really succeeded with this movie. There is lots of awesome and pointless violence, heaps of lame jokes, and an awesome soundtrack (Alice Cooper! Hell yeah!) and just plain Jason being awesome. This is not a movie to watch if you want to be challenged intellectually or anything. It's a movie you watch when you want some mindless entertainment.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Graham)'s body, because he thinks he is still alive. When he opens he's coffin, only to find him dead, he jams a sphere in his chest just for the hell of it. Out of nowhere lighten strikes the sphere. And just like Frankenstien's Monster, JASON comes back from the grave the as UNDEAD. Now how can Tommy kill what's already dead and heading home to Crystal Lake(now called Forest Green).This is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The death scenes are inventive and sometimes funny. the way Tom though of to bring JASON back was sweet. Jennifer Cooke as Megan has to be the sexiest eye candy of the series. Thom Mathews's Tommy is also a standout role and the best one. In each film there is a different character study of how he is becoming. And David Kagen role is a screen stealer. The comedy dosen't even hurt the film. A must see for JASON fans, because this is like a love poem. This is also the start of Zombie JASON.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
211,troutman,Jason Lives & bores the viewer to death!,2,9 March 1999,Apart from Jason Goes To Hell this has to be the biggest pile of crap to have the Friday the 13th title to date.Ignoring the stupid way that Jason is brought back from the dead the film itself has no plot at all - most of the others in the series had at least a flimsy plot onto which they could make money out of.It's at this point in the '80s that horror really started to go down the toilet and this film demonstrates why. During the late '80s many of the films tried to use humor however it helps if you are making a horror film for the film to be scary.Not all the fault for this film lies with the film makers as it was hacked to pieces by the censors - however I can't see that the film would have been any better had they left it alone.,Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Unfortunately, his plan ends up accidentally bringing Jason back to life and he has to warn everyone in town of his return.Jason Lives goes for a much welcome tongue in cheek approach to its horror and is all the more interesting for it.

217,Krush_Burner,Jason Voorhees vs. Tommy Jarvis: the final round,10,4 December 2014,"This part is one of my personal favorites. It has less suspense, that is true, but offers a lot of other things to enjoy. First of all, Jason Voorhees is back – and he's on the road of revenge again. It is interesting that ""Jason Lives"" strictly follows the classic plot structure (which was introduced in the very first part of ""Friday the 13th""), but at the same time film manages to incorporate new elements into the basic story. This is possible mainly because of returning of Tommy Jarvis, who is now actually steals the show sometimes. The subplot of Tommy and Jason's clash is the basic story driver here, and it's working pretty good to keep your attention. Secondly, most of death scenes are remarkable for one reason or another: Jason is on the killing spree, and there will be no mercy for anyone who tries to stop him. Thirdly, this part has a very catchy soundtrack, including not only Harry Manfredini's famous tunes, but also some portions of good old 1980's hard rock (most notable song is, of course, Alice Cooper's ""He's Back"" which plays during the end titles).

Listed as the best Jason film by fans of the series, although so far I would call it the worst outside of the universally panned fifth film. Not only does this begin a series of 'Friday' films where Jason is for a lack of better words a supernatural zombie, but it also marks the point in the franchise where Jason became the film's hero rather than antagonist. The film also brought in an abundance of campy humor that really felt out of place at times, although admittedly some of the gags were pretty neat. There was some cool kills and impressive make-up effects, but the cast was largely forgettable and there was a number of incredibly stupid moments most notably the bumbling paint ball players. Worst looking Crystal Lake to date, with the foggy atmosphere of the woods creating the illusion that Crystal Lake is down south, when all the other films pointed toward a New Jersey area location. What I did like about the film was that the killings took place while the kids were at the camp, something I've been waiting to happen for awhile.

This particular installment is surely better than Part V (not a big accomplishment), but marks the last of the series that I can stomach to watch. Parts I-IV are absolutely classic and crucial slasher/horror films, but after that things get a bit hazy.On the bright side, ""Jason Lives"" features Jason at his absolute most brutal and ruthless, throwing girls through windows and tearing off body parts left and right. The reincarnated/zombie back-story is more than just a bit over the top, but the part is well played and Jason is somehow even less human than before. There is blood just about everywhere in this one, and the body count is very high. I love the couple in the beginning trying to scare the killer off when he stops their car. Hint: IT DOESN'T WORK!The downside however is the ABSOLUTE OVERUSE of comedy relief. Even Mr. Voorhees himself gestures and behaves comically a couple times and that I just can't bear to watch. Tommy Jarvis seems to be based somewhat on Ash from the Evil Dead flicks in this movie with his attitude and one liners, but Megan is nigh-unwatchable due to her horrible overacting and poorly executed intentional childish attitude.I almost would say this movie should be avoided due to it's constant terrible humor, but it does have some great kills, and every fan of the series is mainly into those anyway.

228,cwstone,10/10 - (Relatively Speaking),10,12 November 2020,"Jason Lives is, for my money, the best in the Friday the 13th series. So I give it 10 stars based solely on that opinion. This isn't King Lear but it is an uncommonly clever slasher film. It's stark contrast to the other installments is what ultimately puts it over the top.
Jason Lives' director wanted to try something different from that tried and true formula that would have normally apply. That in itself commands a certain level of respect. Luckily in this case he really is able to pull it off.
Now, there's nothing wrong with dopey fun slasher movies. They don't ask for much and the successful ones deliver what we ask of it. Insane violence, a good villain, and a healthy dose of good looking ladies sans clothing. I enjoy the other Friday the 13th films (even though after this one they really started to go downhill).
Jason Lives appeals to me but just in a different way. It's tongue and cheek approach to the story is kind of endearing. The explicit violence and the self seriousness of the other films is left behind. In its place we are given a healthy dose of tongue and cheek winks at the audience and self referential humor. It's a lot like Scream in that respect but Jason Lives did it first and better in my opinion.
This is a film that acknowledges its ridiculousness and what were, even at the time, considered to be played out horror tropes. In not taking itself too seriously it shows us a certain level respect. I find myself even more willing to go along with it. Typical horror fare does not concern itself with catering to our higher levels of thinking. And as I said, that's perfectly fine too.
Jason Lives has some legitimately funny moments but it also doesn't play around. Jason is still mean as hell and the end body count reflects as much.
But this is a film that seems to take better care of us than say Friday the 13th Part 2 (which I also like). Many of primary characters here aren't the typical scumbags living and working in Crystal Lake. Even the pissed of Sheriff is sympathetic. He cares about his daughter's safety and very reasonably believes that Tommy is dangerous. The counselors mostly come off as nice kids and seem interested in the welfare of their charges. They don't fit the stereotypical horror characters who are usually, at best, selfish and self indulgent. We don't feel bad when they die, we just enjoy the process. But here we have characters whose deaths are sometimes kind of bummer. The actors who plays Tommy and the sheriffs daughter especially have us rooting for them to survive! We don't miss the excessive gore because this installment is able to be effective without it. Although damn, some are pretty brutal.
Add some breaking of the fourth wall, nods to the old Universal horror films, good characters, decent story...this feels like the best rounded of the series.
Jason 6 is not anything brilliant, but it took an established horror franchise and tried a different approach. It works and I think it will work for you as well. Have fun!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

I hope Jason X will turn out like this one rather than something like Friday The 13th Part 4 (very boring and stupid)Rated AA 14+ (In Canada) for brief strong brutal violence, coarse language and some sexuality.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
230,Porkchop_Express,The best F-13 film to date,10,28 May 2002,"F-13 'Jason Lives' is the best Jason movie to date. This one has it all...the best script, dialogue, characters & music. Most of the songs are performed by the shock master himself, Alice Cooper. The movie picks up years after part 5, where a older Tommy Jarvis goes to the cemetery that Jason is buried at. He wants to see with his own eyes that Jason is 'truly' dead. But a accident happens, & Jason comes back to life...again. Tommy tries to warn the local Sheriff, with no luck, so he must stop Jason. The movie returns to the camp environment, where the film had strayed away from. The movie is strong from start to finish, & you won't be disappointed!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
231,geno-young,This one bested the original and all others...,10,14 October 2017,"This film is the first on the list of (surprisingly) many ""Friday"" fans. I found this out when I saw about 100 comments on a photo on the ""Friday The 13th: The Game"" Facebook page; and rightfully so. This film has it all, it's fast paced, entertaining, terrifying, gory, funny and sexy all in one big package! There seriously isn't a dull moment and the momentum never falters. I say that this sequel is better than all others including the original because of how well done it really is. Jason is back home at Camp Crystal Lake and really goes to town on everyone in his way. The kills are unmatched, and the entire film puts you in that classic, sexy 80s feel and although there is humor, Tommy Jarvis' warnings go unheeded and there is an overall feeling of foreboding dread. Of all of the films, the kills on this one are really imaginative and unique with Jason utilizing a handy tool belt for his instruments of death. Needless to say, this cast is the best out of any of the films, with some really compelling performances (a thing that the ""Friday The 13"" series isn't known for); which really makes for a standout film. I really like that they're on site at the actual campground of Crystal Lake for the first time since Part One, and you really get that summer camp feel. Another factor that makes Part 6 so great are Jason's new found abilities, which debut in this film. No more is Jason the large, freaky, deformed fast moving masked maniac that we were introduced to in parts 2-4, but rather now an unstoppable force of nature, this is the introduction of Undead Jason, with all of his freakishly powerful abilities. Jason LIVES in this film and by extension, terror lives this film! After the dismal fifth entry, Paramount KNEW that they had to comeback in a really big way with Jason, and that's exactly what they did! This is the best camp film ever made hands down, and Jason really puts on a KILLER show!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

The producers had to improve on Part V, so they traded in some of the grue of the earlier sequels and concentrated on laughs and well placed sight gags. The action takes place some time after Part V as Tommy escapes from the institution and digs up the rotting corpse of Jason Voorhees, guess what happens next? No need to answer as ol' Jay goes on a rampage the likes of which this series had never seen before or since. Also, Jason is no longer in the shadows of Camp Crystal Lake, he is allowed alot of screen time and is given a personality, complete with head twitches and gestures, something that would be improved and expanded upon by Kane Hodder in future Friday installments. A good way to spend a rainy day or a dark night in front of the tv, now go rent!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
234,fridayfan1,One of the best!!,8,2 April 2001,"Okay, you'd think that by the time they reach part six that they would be running out of ideas..not so, this is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The characters are likeable, and the music is great. Of course it's still just Jason slaughtering more teens, but in this one the death scenes are much more original. After watching part 5 one might have given up on the series, but trust me after watching part 6 you will realize why you love watching Friday the 13th.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
235,MikeyMo_nl,Delivers what you expect and more,7,29 October 2002,"Jason, the legendary Hockeymasked slasher has made quite a franchise of himself throughout the years. A pretty good accomplishment considering his main trademark, the hockeymask, was  only introduced in the 3rd installment. Most movie franchises have 3 films the most (Godfather, Back to the future, The Omen, RoboCop etc.) so when a movie's main gimmick (the hockeymask) is introduced after 2 movies it's quite an achievement that people Can you imagine Freddy without the gloves from day 1? I can't.So after reading reviews here about good ol' Jason's movies it occured to me that some people do more slashing at his movies then he does in all of his movies together.Unfair I say, because 9 out of 10 times you get exactly what the people behind the movie promise you: 1,5 hour  long halfnaked pot smoking teenagers in the woods who get chopped up by a guy with a machete and a hockeymask (ok, so in part 1 it was his Ms. Voorhees and in part 9 it was a worm) You know what you can expect when you watch a Friday the 13th movie, and still some people review the movies like they were expecting a Usual Suspects!Well this is the 6th installment in the series which reached a total of 10 movies with the release of Jason X last year. This is one of the better installments I must say. Out with all the seriousness, in with a swift and slick slashermovie featuring ol' Jason. There are excellent scenes in this one, the paintball-office-nerds- scene being the best one. Offcourse this being a typical slashermovie from the 80's you can expect the standard typecasting; everybody takes him/herself extremely serious (except for the 1st victims in the Beetle), there's the standard rebel teenagers who don't listen to dad, there's the ignorant local sherrif who doesn't believe that there is a supernatural serialkiller on the loose, there's the hero who wastes more time running around warning about the killer then trying to stop him. The only thing it lacks, but what we do expect in a friday-flick, is hot nude teengirls (played by girls who are way in their 20's offcourse). That's too bad, since Jason made it standard that if you do smoke pot and/or have pre-marital sex (although playing strip-poker is enough to get yourself killed) it is kind of a downside that the only sex-scene in the movie is one where the people having sex have all their clothes on and just move silly.Well, I cab rave about this movie because it brings you the Man with the mask in a high-bodycount-story with a sense of humor. Too bad there were no naked teengirls, but there are plenty of other Friday-installments in which they do get chopped up.I rate this one 4 out of 5 compared with other Friday the 13th's",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
236,raimi3,For Fellow Friday Fans,7,18 August 2003,"Judging by this movies rating and a seemingly never-ending supply of bad reviews gracing the front page, I felt it was time for me to speak up.First of all, in my personal opinion, this is one of the best Friday's. The purpose of this film was to bring back the Jason character from his one year hiatus with a new flair. He was to be an undead zombie (an attempt at advancing his scare factor) that could no longer be killed conventionally (not that he ever could, but still). He would be stronger and he would no longer need weapons to kill his prey. Many a death in this movie are the labor of bare hands. And, for the first time, Jason wouldn't be hiding out or lurking in the shadows. Jason is shown in more shots from above the waist than he ever had been. The filmmakers didn't save full shots of him until the end of the movie like the other Friday's had done. Jason is very much a full character in this movie, rather than the usual stalker in the dark that is only shown as a pair of legs or a hand with a weapon. This is a trend that would be followed in every Friday film after this one.This is the first Friday film to play to the fans. It becomes obvious in the early stages of the film, that the goal isn't to scare the viewer as much as it is to impress them with Jason's new found strength and weapon arsenal. This is also a trend that later Friday's would follow. Basically, this movie reinvents the series. The character of Jason is now a vehicle to get from one death to the next, and the audience spends more time following his tail lights than we have before. In my personal opinion, this is not a bad change.This movie still offers up some good scares, although a seasoned horror film watcher won't really catch them. One of my favorite scenes has a stranded Tommy Jarvis (the hero) calling from a boat floating in the lake to Jason on shore. Jason is within seconds of killing Tommy's love interest, but drops the task in favor of pursuing the hopeless Tommy. Jason marches into the lake and soon becomes hidden by the deepening water line. Tommy now knows that Jason is underneath him, and could pop out at any moment.Really people, this movie isn't that bad. If you care enough to search the site for this movie, than it is only fair that you get treated to at least one good review. And for Kane Hodder Fans, C.J. Graham did a good job too don't you think? Bonus points for the songs by Alice Cooper.7/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
237,jackbruns29,The most fun out of all the sequels,8,31 December 2020,"I love this movie. Once again, I'm all with Jay Bauman of RedLetterMedia. Part four might've been the best overall, but this one is the funnest. It's the one most like a rollercoaster. Turn your brain off and just go with it.To start off with, Jason is resurrected via lightning strike after being dug up by Tommy Jarvis. Yes, with another actor, Tommy Jarvis makes his final appearance to date in a Friday the 13th movie. From there, it ascends into all the glorious tropes you expect from this series - except it's even better. Because besides the camp counselors making their triumphant return, we finally actually get children in the movie. Yes! Camp Crystal lake finally actually gives the camp counselors something to do besides being killed off by Jason.Now, it doesn't have as much gore as the previous installments, and no real nudity, but the atmosphere is great. The story is great. The characters are great. The humor works. It's part six. They did the best job they could with this franchise - with this movie. One of my favorite horror movies of all time.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

The characters here are pretty much likeable cannon fodder, the killings are fairly inventive but again YOUR MPAA spoilt the fun.

However, a lightning bolt hits Jason and he wakes up, kills Tommy's friend, and heads back for Crystal Lake.

241,adamoconnell,"brilliant sequel, brilliant soundtrack, brilliant massacre",10,3 February 2010,"this is undoubtedly my favorite Jason movie, and I consider it even better than Graduation Day! The first thing that makes this movie is the humor. it is not overused like most people would do to it for this kind of film, but Tom Mcloughlin knows what we Jason followers like and he delivers an excellent sequel. then of course, since its Friday the 13th, why not have some great kills? Well, this movie has just that, but it works, and it doesn't seem forced, like Jason has to kill him because he's a 2-D character that we don't want haunting the script. nope, all the characters are actually kind of likable, and for once, I felt that we weren't overpopulated with horny adolescents. Jason slaughters them, sure, but this time, he's killing counselors. I mean yeah, maybe that Hawes fella was a bit goofy, but he got one hell of a way out, so if you think about, you almost sympathize with these victims, rather than just Jason, but as always, you side with the Big J and just have fun. its a tradition. Characters are developed and this is actually my favorite part of the film. the funny characters. now, atmosphere. is it scary? well, thinking what i said about humor, you might think this one is one to skip if you looking for a good scare, but there is a very intense scene with Jason getting ready to take out camper Paula by redecorating the cabin with her-Jason loves red. but, the door blows open, Paula goes to close, nothing happens. its actually is pretty creepy in its own right, and for that I really love it and congratulate it. Another strong point is the score. no Harry Manfredini this time round, just Alice Cooper! yeah, my favorite song of his, it really does kinda put you in Crystal Lake. The acting is superb. the best for all Friday sequels ( I love John D. LeMay and Steve Williams in JGTH, but everyone here is great) they are believable and I don't think I've latched on to a horror victim like this before. i am emotionally attached to this movie, its wonderful.

It has a good horror line. It actually builds suspense. There is only one gory scene, but besides that it is good. The plot involves determinded Tommy Jarvis going to Jason Voorhees grave to make sure that he is dead with his friend. Upon digging up the grave, lighting his a metal pole Tommy shoved into Jason and shocks Jason to life. Jason gets up and kills Tommys friend by pulling out his heart. Tommy drives down to the sheriff's office to warn the sheriff. Meanwhile Jason kills a couple. Bla Bla Bla. The paintball scene is pretty cool. It enjoyed the credits. The acting is alright.

243,Htom_Sirveaux,"Easily the best in the series up until ""Freddy vs. Jason.""",6,31 December 2011,"And it pains me to say that, considering that Kane Hodder is my favorite Jason, and he didn't show up until the horrifically below-par ""Part VII."" But as far as ""Friday the 13th"" films go, ""Part VI"" takes the cake as the best.The first thing they did right was bringing back Jason, and by that I mean the REAL Jason, not some copycat killer like in the fifth film. Adding in Thom Matthews of ""Return of the Living Dead"" fame as Tommy Jarvis was also a nice touch. Determined to destroy Jason Voorhees' (C. J. Graham) ""mortal"" remains to ensure that he never comes back (yeah, right), Tommy and his friend inadvertently wind up actually facilitating the exact opposite of what they intended when a stray lightning bolt strikes the iron prong Tommy impales Jason's body with in a fit of rage, resurrecting the mad slasher for another showdown with promiscuous and/or intoxicated young people.What follows is the best-scripted film in the series up until Jason's future showdown with Freddy Krueger, as he returns to what he does best, procuring himself a machete and inflicting his brutal revenge on just about everyone he meets. The nice thing about this movie is that while it's an old formula that kept getting recycled, the victims in this movie weren't nearly as obnoxious as they were in both previous and following films (the same can be said of ""Part VIII""). Furthermore, the film manages to poke fun at itself to the audience's amusement while at the same time being faithful to its series. The ""final"" showdown between Jason and Tommy is quite entertaining as well.It's hard to bring originality to a film series that is beating a dead horse - and even harder for a slasher film series, which are notorious for beating a dead horse in the first place - but ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" succeeds. If you're a slasher fan, don't miss it; you probably won't be disappointed.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
244,randomorwhat,The best Friday? Perhaps...,8,7 October 2008,"There can be no denying the cult status of the original Friday the 13th. Or even, for that matter, its two sequels. This sequel separates itself from its predecessors in its tongue in cheek approach to horror movie clichés and clever cinematic techniques. Homages to Nightmare on Elm Street, Frankenstein etc., are controlled well without relying on previous horror tradition.One thing that separates this is perhaps its pure enjoyable nature. This film is amazingly fun to watch and well acted. At some point, when I come to watch he film again, I will give a point-by-point analysis of why this film has such a place in my heart. Until then, suffice to say - excellent kills, sufficiently good acting, a well-shot film, and cleverly directed (watch for the breaking of the forth wall...tres pretentious)",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
245,tyhemp-2,Jason really LIVES...,10,19 December 1999,"With the exception of part 9, ALL of the ""Jason"" movies just keep getting better!  In my honest opinion, this sequel comes in third as far as Jason ""sequels"" go (ps:part 1 will always rule) and this sequel comes in right after parts 2 and 4.  Part 1 is simply a classic.Director/Writer Tom McLoughlin has literally recreated Jason after the turn of events in part 5, replacing the character's once-human figure from parts 2-4 with a better, more menacing, grosser, unkillable, zombie-like figure. In this installment, it seems that Jason has stopped chasing his victims and has become a little more quiet and subtle about his ""kills"".Most of all, McLoughlin really makes ""Jason Live"" in this movie.  Jason thrives!!  McLoughlin, in my opinion, has directed what is probably the most ""scary"" Jason of them all.  I've seen them all a hundred times, and I still jump when he appears in the window in front of Sissy.  The acting is extremely acceptable from its predecessors, especially the roles of Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews) and Sheriff Garris (David Kagen).  Even the camp counselors liven up their roles a bit.  Though it was inevitable for them to be slaughtered, I still thought that it was cool that I still remember their characters.  There is just something about this one.  Jason Lives has an excellent story line that delivers, however, the gore is relatively low at certain times, but McLoughlin never fails to bring it all back with shots of that very very bloody machete of Jason's.This sequel contains many of my favorite death scenes so far in the series. What McLoughlin did in this movie that previous directors didn't was he actually made Jason unpredictable.  I mean, you KNOW he's gonna kill the counselors, but you don't know when or where. I absolutely LOVE that feeling of uncertainty.  McLoughlin has Jason lurking out of windows, behind doors, and the scariest part is when Jason is unknowingly in the motor home as the teenagers pull away from camp.  There is also a lot of the usual CH CH CH HA HA HA and deep black darkness to enhance Jason's (CJ Graham's) menacing figure.For once I didn't want any of the characters to get killed.  I enjoyed all of their roles.  I especially didn't want Paula (Kerry Noonan) to die, and her responsible, soft-spoken, motherly role had me rooting for her to be the lone survivor.  That was a first for me...except for Chrissy in part III I never really cared much for the campers.  However, my hopes were mutilated in the cabin when Paula dies probably Jason's most notorious kill to date. My God, that cabin is bloody!Overall, I recommend this installment to any hardcore Jason fan.  It is a real horror movie, this time it's for real.  Rent it, buy it, do whatever! It's great!   Jason Lives...he breathes...he can never die",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
246,ArmandTanzarian,Let sleeping dogs lie.,5,27 July 2007,"Here, Tommy from Part 4 decides, years later, to 'make sure ' Jason is really dead by digging him up and sticking a metal pole thru him. Naturally, the pole is struck by lightning and Jason comes back to life and a new rampage begins. There's a few changes to the formula in this one: Firstly, Jason is now a super strength, indestructible zombie type, his running days are long over. A lot of the action is taken away from Camp Crystal Lake as Tommy has various run-ins with the local Sheriff trying to persuade him Jason is real. Therefore, the idea of being claustrophobically trapped in CCL is lost in this one. Instead we get a hackneyed 'race against time' sort of thing where Tommy is trying to save the newly arrived kids at the camp and few counsellors. So we get Jason making his way there, leaving behind an OTT body-count while Tommy has to give the Sheriff the slip/bust out of the jail etc etc.Anyway, from reading some occult books (seemingly mid-film) Tommy decides that to kill Jason they need to drown him in the lake where he originally drowned as a young boy. Hmmm, hang on a minute - didn't Jason not drown at all? But anyway, Tommy manages to chain him to a rock and leave him at the bottom of the lake, with his neck chewed up by a boat propellor for good measure. Of course, at the very end we see Jason's eye is open, paving the way for part 7. This film has a different mood and tone than 1-4, probably due to the slight change of plot/location. Saying that, the earlier films were hardly 'The Shining' in terms of atmosphere so that's not a great loss. The body count is a bit OTT with extra characters appearing and being killed in the same scene, as if they had a stock of death scenes on the shelf to use in this franchise and just edited on in here and there. There's a bit of humour in this one and a few references to the conventions of earlier films and this genre; the drunken grave digger, some cynically wise cracking kids, the cynical authority figure etc. Anyway, a few changes to the formula, but the end result is still the same, a 'paint by numbers' slasher film bereft of real horror, tension or scares best enjoyed for laughs, and despite the high body count the actual gore is quite scaled down. Part 7 followed, which was passable, as apparently no one thought to remove the body from the bottom of the lake after Part 6. It was downhill from there with the 'original' (pre Jason X)F13 films tho with 'Jason Takes Manhattan' taking place 90% on a boat and the truly awful,'Jasonless'(rip off of 'Shocker' and 'Fallen' with elements of the equally bad later Halloween sequels ) part 9. Anyway, it's unfair to judge these films against 'real' films so I'd say that this one is probably one of the 'best' of the sequels and is passable'ironic' entertainment.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
247,ThomasBleedPHD,Easily the best of the franchise,8,20 July 2015,"The Friday the 13th series has a lot of movies under it's belt. Most range from ""bad enough to be good"" or ""entertaining despite it's flaws"" while some titles fall into ""just plain bad"" territory (A New Beginning, Jason Takes Manhattan and The Final Friday.) But for the most part, this franchise has been surprising competent for the number of films it's put out. It's ratio of good to bad entries is about 9- 3.""Jason Lives"" however, is easily the best standalone film of the series. (I'm not counting Freddy vs Jason because it's a crossover.) It pretty much sets the standard that a Friday the 13th film should strive for.The plot is pretty standard fair, Jason running around in the woods killing teenagers and tertiary characters while a pair of moony-eyed protagonists try their hardest to stop him. What makes this movie unique is that it's the first one where Jason is ""undead."" Making him nigh-invulnerable to conventional weapons and totally impervious to pain. He shrugs off gunshots and stab wounds, smashes his way through walls and tosses people around with relative ease. Jason becomes a sort of hulking, lumbering Frankenstien-type monster. Probably why he was revived with a lightning bolt in the intro.Complete and total '80s slasher cheese, this movie is an absolute blast for people who enjoy these kinds of films. This movie in particular features a touch more comedy then previous entries. Lots of goofy '80s comedy stuff and clever little one-liners. But the funniest moments in this movie, surprisingly, come from Jason. His dull, blank reactions to everything around him are hilarious. His slow head turns, his blank stares, his long pauses. It's like he's constantly saying ""Are you serious?"" in his mind before he kills someone.But what really surprised me is that I ended up liking the other characters in the movie. The protagonist, the love interest, even the one character I really hated got a great moment near the end and I actually felt bad to see him die. This movie hits the mark perfectly. It's everything a Friday the 13th movie should be. If you're only ever going to watch one of these movies in your life, this is definitely the one. But you really can't go too wrong, so long as your one movie isn't ""The Final Friday.""8/10 - The most Friday the 13thiest Friday the 13th movie ever made.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
248,zergling_seb,A Great Jason Flick.,7,3 December 2006,"OK, so Friday the 13th has not been known for particularly great and compelling movies. But I really feel that Jason Lives proves the critics wrong about the entire series. OK the movies starts off with the only teen to appear in more than two films Tommy Jarvis, he's driving around and tries to cremate Jason, big mistake! Jason begins to get up (after being hit by lightning.) And bing boom bam, it's the basic Jason formula. Kill, rip, stab, repeat. OK, so you've obviously gotten used to this, Jason kills the kids who have sex, drink, blah blah. The real great part about this series is really the establishment that Jason actually has a weak spot. Up until now it's been hitting Jason in the face with an ax or a machete. But now Jason becomes an even deeper character.But enough of that! Jason continues to kick teens around like the little children they are. Oh and of course the old gravedigger. Jason continues to stay in Tommy's mind, Tommy is jailed for being disruptive and causing havoc. It then comes down to a final showdown at the camp where Jason nearly drowned many years ago. Jason goes (and this surprised me...) and kills the Christian, peppy, la la girl. Not only kill, but he massacres her (including being thrown through a window.) Jason finally fights Tommy, Tommy takes Jason to the lake (lures) Jason eventually is put underwater and has his eye cut out by a motorboat propeller. (A fact which every director since has decided to ignore for some reason.) This to me is the one Jason movies that if I had to choose to represent the ENTIRE series, I'd pick. Good kills, actual character development, and just Jason in general being kick ASS! The only real problem is that again the director decides to stick with the same formula. It can get very tiresome, very quickly. Still an awesome movie and I would recommend this 100%",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
249,partybabe1998,Amazing!,9,11 July 2014,"Whoever said this film was the best in the series, you're right. Jason Lives revolves around Tommy Jarvis, the hero from parts 4 and 5 who has just witnessed Jason's return from the grave. Tommy tries to tell the police but they are skeptical. meanwhile Camp Crystal Lake( now called Camp Forest Green) is reopening for the summer, when murders start happening at the camp, Tommy is blamed and subsequently locked up. The only person who believes Tommy is the sheriff's daughter, Megan, who breaks him out of jail and drives him to the lake so he can get his final revenge on Jason. What else can I say? Jason Lives is action packed, gory, humorous, suspenseful, and even kind of heartwarming all at the same time, the score and soundtrack are amazing, The male and female lead have great chemistry, the acting is pretty decent, the characters are very likable, The kills are creative, and Jason(played expertly by C.J. Graham)has an awesome look in this movie. So I would strongly recommend Jason Lives: Friday the 13th part VI.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
250,Halloween1247,A Great Friday the 13th Movie,7,10 October 2015,"After Friday part 5 was a commercial failure, fans screamed out for the return of Jason (the REAL Jason)and the answer came in the form of a Frankenstein lightning bolt. This one movie changed Jason for life by making him a zombie and separating him from the slew of slasher villains(namely Michael Myers).The films starts off with Tommy Jarvis digging up Jason's corpse and preparing to burn it, but out of nowhere a lightning bolt strikes Jason's corpse. Jason has now been reanimated, Tommy's worst fear. Tommy runs to the police, but unfortunately for him Sheriff Garris ( David Kagen ) knows that Tommy as spent time in a mental hospital. Thinking that Tommy is crazy, Garris locks him up for the night. The next morning, His daughter Megan and some counselors show up, hoping that the police will know where some of the friends are, not knowing that they were killed by Jason the night before. Megan takes an interest to Tommy, which leads to her helping Tommy in his quest to stop Jason. The thing that gives this movie an advantage over most installments of the franchise is has a bit more plot than your average Friday the 13th movie. This movie does not have an amazing story by any stretch of the imagination but it is nice to see some effort put into the story, rather then just go with "" Jason's on the loose "". The thing I like most about the narrative is that the director (Tom McLoughlin) makes his characters self-aware , a decade before Scream did this. In order to fit this happy-go-lucky slasher flick Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews) is altered appropriately. Tommy had a serious case of P.T.S.D in the previous film, but that all changes. Tommy is now just guy with some issues. Tommy's nerdier aspects are changed too, like his love of making masks and special effects. These changes make Tommy less complicated and interesting, but I personally like Thom Matthews as Tommy. Matthews has this kind of charisma that makes for an entertaining performance and he has good chemistry with Jennifer Cook as Megan. Megan is a little different from the usual Friday The 13th final girl. The usual final girl in a Friday film are mature and not heavily involved with someone, the exception being Amy Steel's Ginny Field. Megan is more assertive and outgoing then the others before her, and is definitely not mature. Sheriff Garris is almost a secondary antagonist in the film. He is always locking Tommy up and all together, just making stopping Jason more challenging. He does do the logical thing for a person in his position to do though, like when he locks up Tommy for grabbing for some guns. Would you let a guy you know has mental issues go and grab a loaded gun? Or when he fires his gun at Jason, sees they have no effect, and instead of just standing there like most slasher film characters, he makes a runs for it. Now about Jason Voorhees, the REAL Star of the movie. While Jason does not change much physically except for a rotted head, he does get this bad ass utility belt which makes him a horror movie Batman. Some people complain that Jason is too zombie like but I think this is a fine as Jason still gets the job done and he has never been the fastest killer around. It became a problem in later sequels when Jason can punch off heads or twist head around with a push. Speaking of the kills, they are not as over the top or creative as the kills in the previous films and pretty light on the gore and that can sometimes be a deal breaker for slasher films for some people. Also this film has no nudity, something that all the others have. The films score is made by Harry Manfredini and is not the usual Friday the 13th theme. The usual themes in the previous movies are here, but there is some new additions. One particularity memorable theme is the one that plays as Jason dawns his hockey mask. The new themes had some freshness to the series, which was really needed at that point. The film also features a few songs by Alice Cooper. There is a particularly good song "" The Man Behind The Mask "" that was made for this movie, that is really fitting. And finally at the end of this film Tommy Jarvis chains Jason to the bottom of Crystal Lake, bringing the series full circle. There is a cut ending where Jason's father is shown and it is hinted that he would make an appearance in the series. It sucks that this ending was cut from the film because if Jason's father had made an appearance in a sequel with Thom Matthews as the lead, this could have actually created a story in the series. Unfortunately Paramount took the easy way out and this did not happen. All and all this is a great slasher movie and easily one of the best of the series, if not the best. It sure as hell is my favourite, and I would recommend this movie to newcomers to the series (or the first one) even though it is the sixth installment, because in the Friday the 13th franchise almost all of the movies are the same. Although this movie lacks any actual horror, it is still an entertaining and great sequel.Worth a watch for slasher movie fans7.5/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
251,barrosjared,"Cheesy, Self Aware Slasher Film!",7,2 September 2018,"Friday the 13th: Jason Lives, finally reaches higher than mediocrity or downright awfulness in a sequel; it's good. The cinematography and music score are top notch, Harry Manfredini added new tracks to his score, which is definitely 1980s music, but it works. The story is a precursor to Scream and can be funny, but the silliness becomes far too much in some scenes. The paintball scene is just slapstick, Looney Tunes style silly. That is another thing to bring up, the film is NOT scary! It is not very creative in the kill sequences, the buildup is not very great, some of the kills are just too goofy and are not very disturbing like earlier installments. Thom Matthews is Tommy Jarvis, he is one like able dude, but has lost that Part 5 psychology aspect that is very interesting. Jennifer Cooke is ok, but is charming enough. Now let's talk about Jason Voorhees himself, while he has always been portrayed as a mortal human being in the previous sequels, this film resurrects Jason as a unkillable, zombie character with superhuman abilities. This allows the murder sequences to be more over the top. I don't prefer this portrayal of Jason, he is much more frightening, interesting, and much more grounded than he is in this film. Even though I have been mostly bashing on this film, I love it. I can appreciate it for it's quality, the best installment since the original F13. Is this as good as the first F13 in the strict sense? NO! But it was never trying to be and it is incredible fun! 7/10",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

260,JackBurtonsMullet,A nice package of campy fun.,7,8 July 2013,"""Friday the 13th"" has always been an audience-polarizing series ever since the first one appeared in 1980. The sequels up to this point have ranged from decent to banging-your-head-against-the-wall stupid. That's how most horror films were at the time. The only ones that ever really did anything different were the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Re-Animator"", and ""Evil Dead"" films. These gory classics had everything that the audiences wanted, and the self-deprecating humor that even got the critics to love them. ""Jason Lives"" wisely takes cues from those films and what we got was the best ""Friday the 13th"" film in the series.This movie knows how ridiculous it is, and it wants you to know it too. The basic premise draws inspiration from the classics like ""Frankenstein"". Jason's carcass is brought back from the dead by a bolt of lighting, and the carnage continues. This sequel definitely has a twisted sense of humor, which is exactly what this series needed. It needed to really take a look at itself and just give in to its own stupidity. The rest of the series would then follow this movie's formula. This includes the girl with psychic powers in ""The New Blood"", Jason taking Manhattan in ""Part VIII"", Jason being blown up and his soul coming back to haunt everyone in ""Jason Goes to Hell"", and Jason in space in ""Jason X"". Obviously there was a huge drop-off in quality as the sequels came and went, but ""Jason Lives"" still endures as both a satire and a slasher classic.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

I mean, it's as if the makers of the film knew what we wouldn't admit to - the 5th film was a mess and the series wasn't top-notch to begin with - these movies, at times, can be inherently silly.I don't watch these movies thinking that they are the best examples of what can be done with horror. So, why take it so seriously? The first two films were straight up trying to be frightening, but part 3 and beyond...I have much love for these films and this one features better than average acting, some solid humor and Tom McLoughlin did a great job directing this one.

So when part 6 came out, it was just cool to see Jason back doing what he does best, slicing and dicing. and they almost had to bring him back from the dead. I mean, what else were they going to do. but watching it now, I just laugh at how they give the fans what they want, jason actually walking around in the woods, hacking people up.

The potential was there in the earlier films, but he has always been essentially a clumsy big guy who manages to kill people by pursuing them relentlessly. In six, he gets some style, the triple decapitation is awesome as is the first counsellor's death! The story line is cohesive, but not ground breaking, but hey its a Friday the 13th film!! But the scenes with the kids add a new dimension to Jason's character The acting is ok, with a stand out performance from CJ Graham who's Jason is brilliant!

265,badjabs25,Excellent Horror Movie! This one Excels!,10,8 August 2013,"As most of my generation that grew up in the 80's we grew up with some of the greatest iconic horror villains of all-time, Freddy Kruger, Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. I have always been drawn to the Friday the 13th series over all others. These movies are some of my favorites of all-time.I am also a bog believer in that in a horror series the original does not and is not always the best in the series. This is the case with the original Friday series. Jason is Friday the 13th so in saying and knowing that it takes away the importance and value of the Original film released in 1980. No kids or young adults are/were going to be scared to camp out in the woods or go to summer camp in fear of little old Mrs. Voorhees. This film is excellent in that from start to finish it is entertaining. The music in this movie is also the best of the series IMO. The opening title starts with wind blowing then fades to a dark sky with lightening. Then it shows a lake with trees, very eerie and creepy. The theme is incredible. Tommy Jarvis is played by Thom Mathews and he excels. This is a very iconic film and one of if not the best in the series. CJ Graham is the most imposing Jason ever at about 6 ft 6. Hodder might be the best but Graham looks incredible on screen with his movements and stalking. Alice Cooper delivers ""he's Back (the man behind the Mask) as the most well known and successful song from the series. This one from start to finish Delivers!! I Highly Recommend",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Now it's up to Tommy to stop Jason's mindless killing and put him back where he belongs.My opinion OK this movie is a DEEP sequel and to tell the truth it isn't expected to be Great or even average to that but to my surprise I actually enjoyed this film more so than I did the first. The death scenes were sorta clever and Jason to me looked at his best. The 1st scene was a little stupid though coming back through lightening get real. From then on was kewl and Jennifer Cooke's performance was pretty good as well. I wish they showed her boobs though but sadly they didn't have any cleavage in this film . I know shocking isn't it.Also the way they killed Jason was pretty original. Having little kids there made it even better. Although this is the best in the series in my opinion its still just another Friday the 13th sequel there nothing special about at all and to tell the truth it had it shouldn't have ever been made just like all the rest of the F13 films after part 3. To tell the truth like Freddy said in the features on the DVD Jason is very boring and slow. He just walks *Hack hack* and then your dead hes not ruthless as most call hes teddy bear compared to the other killers and how they torture their victims.People really like Jason for some reason I don't know why but I can't stand him I'm more of a Myers fan thank you very much.

267,NightmareVacation2,Great made-for-TV movie -spoilers-,9,31 March 2007,"Before Britian actually caught up with America and got a thing called Satellite TV, the only Friday the 13th movies to actually be shown on any of the 4 channels we had, was this instalment and Jason Takes Manhatten.....this really does say something because of all the entries, these two are the least brutal, the least scary and don't seem to garner up the same hatred and disdain as the other entries do. This film is still a great Frday the 13th movie and is far from the worst, but this film lacks from the real feel of a Friday movie....they're more tongue-in-cheek, less on-screen violence and a more coherent Jason. In this entry Jason appears more co-ordinated than before, he even seems more human and seems to have more intelligence. His clothes are a little cleaner and less ragged, his trousers even to hint at a nice pert bum and he even seems to be a little more aware of who he is and what he's doing, yes this might add something different, but it also takes away the real nastiness that Friday the 13th used to bring. Although heavily cut, the movies' kills are not all that spectacular, some are inventive, but in order to boost the body-count a lot of the kills are quick, dull machete kills. Another thing that takes the feel away from the other movies is the fact that many of the characters are not connected to each other so it's hard to get an atmosphere going of a camp in peril......the cast of children give the film a softer feel too..hence why this is the entry that is shown on British TV the most....a nice change for a Friday movie...but one Friday comedy is all we really need....keep them horror movies....not comedy-horror movies....",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Tommy is the best in this one because he's not some weakling geek like in the past two films. This one has a great storyline, some good death scenes, and some cool special effects for Jason's return from the dead.  C.J. Graham plays one of the best Jasons and is right up there with Kane Hodder (parts 7-9).  Plus the songs from Alice Cooper makes this a great one overall!  Although the death scenes may not as elaborate as those in some others, this one is a good one overall, and it's good at the end to show that he's still 'alive' so-to-speak.

This movie is dumb but very fun and I had a good time watching it. It's pretty self-aware and it knows what it is. Jason also does a lot of super wacky fun kills which is a blast. This Jason is definitely one of my favorites movement wise. I'll keep this review short because all I can say about its flaws chalk up to it's a Friday the 13th movie I mean there's only so much you can get from that plot and script wise.

270,Willarddance,The best of the series,7,25 June 2003,"CAUTION: Possible SpoilersAlthough Jason part 6 is the best of the Friday the 13th series that is not saying much.  The other Friday movies I watched for laughs but this one is actually a decent movie. Jason is much tougher in this film then in the previous ones. One scene a police officer shoots Jason with a pistol multiple times but Jason still lives. In the previous movies if Jason got shot he would have died. I think its good that Jason is stronger because as a human he was kind of pathetic. This movie didn't have as many pointless and stupid parts as the ones before and was entertaining from the beginning where Jason is resurrected to the end where Jason and the hero, Tommy Jarvis fight in Crystal Lake. This movie was funnier and was better in all respects (except in suspense, you see Jason the whole time) then the other movies.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
271,calivachris,Jason Lives,7,19 November 2021,"It's obvious that none of the ""F13"" movies are Oscar-worthy works of art, but they're always entertaining, especially around Halloween. After the events of Part 5 and the imposter Jason, the real Jason is resurrected by a lightning bolt (Frankenstein-style) after Tommy Jarvis returned to his grave to dig up Jason in an attempt to destroy the body by cremation. During the attempt, Tommy snapped from a moment of PTSD and began frantically stabbing the body with a metal fence post. After his moment of insanity, Tommy left the post impaled In Jason's heart and it was struck by lightning, jolting Jason back to life. From then on, it's really more of the same- Jason decapitating unlucky campers and counselors at Crystal Lake. What makes Part 6 a cut above most of the rest in the series is the comedy bits, clever one-liners, and the acting is surprisingly pretty good, considering the fact that it's practically a B-movie slasher flick. It ranks with Part 4 as being the best in the entire franchise.

272,geekiousmaximus,Great Fun Horror that doesn't take itself too seriously,7,13 October 2017,"Let me start off this review by saying that Friday the 13th Part VI is by no means an excellent film. It's drenched in the 80s and has a lot of very cheesy moments. But, in all honesty, I feel that this sort of adds to the charm of the movie. This was the Friday the 13th movie that knew that the franchise would never put out a legitimately good horror film to rival the likes of Halloween. Because of this, the film doesn't take itself too seriously and, as a result, we get what is probably the most enjoyable film in the whole franchise.The film starts out with a grown up Tommy Jarvis driving with a friend to the grave site of Jason Voorhees. Tommy says that he doesn't believe Jason is really dead and feels that it is his duty to put him to rest and make sure he stays dead. But, when Tommy stabs the corpse of Jason with a metal rod, lightning strikes the rod and resurrects Jason as a super-powered zombie. The rest of the film follows Tommy trying to hunt down and end Jason, while also including plenty of what we really came to see: Jason killing people in the most outrageous ways.Right off the bat, you can see an immediate problem with the plot of this movie. Tommy goes to kill Jason once and for all at the start of the film, yet if he hadn't done anything, Jason would have probably stayed dead. The story line has a lot of very strange plot holes like this. However, if you can suspend your disbelief, and just enjoy the absurdity of the scenario, you will have a very fun time. No film that starts off with a James Bond style opening is taking itself very seriously to begin with. So the audience shouldn't take it too seriously either. The fact that this film doesn't take itself too seriously works to the film's advantage in the end. Much like Evil Dead 2 or Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3, when the film doesn't take itself too seriously, it can turn out a very fun and entertaining experience. Part of what makes this experience, in the end, is just the absurdity of some of the kills. This film probably has some of my all time favorite deaths in the Friday the 13th franchise. For example, a paintball player is killed when Jason grabs him by the arm and throws him against a tree. When his face hits the free, it leaves a smiley face indent on the bark. That alone is kind of funny and will get a chuckle out of the audience. But what's even funnier is when Jason looks down and lifts up the severed arm of the paintball player, and looks at it as if he's surprised by his own strength. Bits of tongue and cheek humor like that scattered throughout the film are part of what makes Jason Lives such an enjoyable experience. In the end, Friday the 13th Part VI is by no means a good movie. there are a million plot points that don't make a lot of sense, and an incredibly forced romance between Tommy and the Sheriffs daughter. However, if you can suspend your disbelief and look past a lot of the flaws in the plot, you are in for a very enjoyable experience. A lot of self aware, tongue and cheek humor, along with some good forth wall breaking moments, really makes for a fun and enjoyable experience. This movie is a self aware horror comedy that, much like Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3, just gives the audience what they want, Jason killing people in absurd ways. I would definitely recommend this movie to any horror fan who likes some good tongue and cheek satire.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
273,HurricaneDaddy,The Ultimate Jason Film,10,22 June 2021,"Jason Lives is the most self-aware, comical, and symbolic film in the Friday the 13th franchise, and that's a great thing. It's just fun from beginning to end. The Frankenstein homage in the graveyard to the James Bond title sequence to the gravedigger breaking the fourth wall to say ""why'd they dig Jason up? Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment."" It's just great. Tommy Jarvis hunting Jason is fun--he's the only thing in the movie that plays like there are real stakes. The rest is all satire. I mean, there's a kid at the camp that fell asleep reading a Jean Paul Sartre paperback and one character tries to pay Jason even though he just killed someone right in front of her. The movie just oozes meta-horror and it did it well before Scream popularized the meta-horror genre. I watch this movie about twice a year because it is so entertaining.

274,alishearer-69327,"Silly, and Self-Aware with a James-Bond-sequence title card starring a recently resurrected Jason Voorhees",5,14 May 2021,"Before I get into this review, I just want to state that the Friday movies have never been a personal favourite of mine, my favourite Friday movie being a 6.5/10 at most. I don't have anything against the franchise, I just don't understand its excessive popularity compared to movies like Star Wars, for example. I won't let this bias affect my opinion on the movie and the review itself but I just wanted to make my opinion clear.Jason Lives, Part VI of the Friday franchise, is, from what I've gathered, widely acclaimed among fans. From my viewing, I have very mixed opinions on the movie, however, the kills are great, the movie is fun, risqué scenes are toned down quite significantly in comparison, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, referential lines being dotted around the 1hr 46min runtime.I enjoyed the fact that there seemed to be children staying at the camp in this movie, making it a very refreshing addition.Tommy Jarvis was an alright character, I guess, he kinda just caused Jason to be resurrected from the grave and attempted to convince the stubborn officers that he'd returned until the brief climax where he was unleashed
However, the acting is cringe-worthily awful at points, although, to me, this adds rather comedic elements to the movie and can make it more enjoyable to specific audiences.Something I noticed that I'm unsure whether was due to a certain edition or was included in every version of the movie, was its intensely abrupt ending. Perhaps it was because I watched this later into the night but, unlike the other movies from the series that I have watched, this movie's ending just felt very flat, the climax completing without any form of aftermath explored.Overall, Jason Lives, just like every other movie in the franchise, is an incredibly fun watch that isn't intended to blow minds and leave audiences in awe. If you're looking for a somewhat gory 80s slasher full of idiotic teens, self-aware references and a James-Bond-esque title card starring a recently resurrected Jason Voorhees, well, you've found your match made in heaven.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
275,EpsilonX,"The best one, along with part 2",10,5 July 2007,"first off, i'm not sure if there's spoilers, but I figured i should probably check the box anyways. Wow...this movie actually had me getting nervous at points. The only other horror movies to do that were Halloweens 1 and 2. that being said, jason is at his best here (i've seen 1-6 and jason x, will watch 7 and 8 probably tomorrow (i have the box set)). They actually show him before he goes to kill people instead of just showing his hand and the weapon or whatever. Honestly, that bugged me. but it was executed very well in part 2. every second of this movie was awesome. From the opening with jason's grave, to the ending battle against Jason at the camp, I was glued to the screen. I only looked away once, and that was to shift positions on the couch. The plot was well done for a movie of this style, and as annoying as the cop was, i didn't want him to die, unlike in part 5, which had a superb start but the rest....*fart noise* Tommy, along with Ted from part 4, and the red haired kid and the lead girl from part 2 is one of my favorite characters from the franchise. Many creepy moments in this movie, such as when Jason is watching the girl (megan, is it) walk through the cabin and he follows her, and many action moments, such as when he busts through the door and when he causes the RV to crash. The characters were also extremely likable, from the first few seconds I saw the dude with the ripped jeans and earrings (I don't remember his name) I liked him, and his little speech about the Indians cemented him as my favorite character in the movie...his early death didn't really help much though. And, I couldn't stop laughing through the entire paintball scene with that nerdy looking guy in the hat.While most of the other Friday films just introduced the character then killed him/her off right away, this film actually took time to develop them (not enough time for some characters, but they did good considering its a Friday film) The fact that there's a Camaro helps too. they are cool cars I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good slasher.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Nothing new, but it's funny, scary... and it has a story (not just body counting)!!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
277,castortroy78,Jason is back and he is cool,8,7 May 2002,"Okay, okay.  There is no real point ragging on this genre because we all know what to expect.  If you don't like these type of movies (ie horror movie sequels) then hey, don't watch them.  That said, I love this movie. In my opinion it is the best Jason sequel and one of the better horror movie sequels ever.  Friday the 13th was starting to get stale, trying to stretch the concept a little too far towards unbelievable and to remain serious (number 5 anyone? what was with that?).  So what did the writers do?  They worked out what was cool about the movie series and served it up.  Jason is undead, so have some fun with it.  And this movie does, from the James Bond style intro to the imaginative death scenes.  This one gives the viewers something to cheer about, and for the first time we are cheering for Jason. How annoying are the camp counsellors?  C'mon Jason, kill that Cork guy, and kill him well. The Winnebago sequence is an absolute winner. C.J. Graham is a great Jason, and really gave Kane Hodder (an absoute champion) a direction to take him for the subsequent sequels.To wrap up: this movie saves the series. Sure, it ain't gonna win an academy award, but it is great for a late night, a few beers and some mates.Haven't had Jason X in Australia yet and I am hanging for it!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
278,friendofjordie,Great Installment to the Friday the 13th Franchise,10,20 November 2011,"Fans were awaiting the return of Jason, and he arrived with a bang. After seeing Friday the 13th Part 5: New Beginning my expectations were lowered, and with the announcement of Part 6 I was a little skeptical. However, upon viewing I can safely say that Jason Lives is a solid entry in the series. This is accountable for five major reasons...1) Atmosphere: The foggy, dimly lit, spooky scenario is perfect for Friday the 13th. I also love the huge amount of leaves constantly blowing in the strong wind.2) Kills: The murders in Part 6 are great, I quite like when Jason bends the sheriff in half. Also, there is a lot less cut-aways and Jason always has new inventive ways to annihilate his victims3) Acting: The acting in this installment is better than the others. Thom Mathews is way better playing Tommy Jarvis than the mute from Part 5. The supporting actors are all good, and the combination of Tommy's seriousness and Megan's playful attitude are a great mix.4) Direction: Tom Mcloughlin did a great job blending humour with suspense in this film. There is a lot of good camera work and creepy lighting.5) Humorous Attitude: Part 6 really understood that the seriousness of the early movies was getting old, so this on decided to go the more comedic route. Thats no to say no other movie had done that, but this one brought it back after Part 5. In conclusion, this little horror flick is a fun title to have in your collection and my favourite Friday the 13th movie, along with Part 4.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
279,ifitrocks,Best of the entire series....nuff said!!,10,29 November 2005,"Where can I even start with this one. First of all the graveyard resurrection scene was amazing. If you don't think the lightning reanimation was one of the best moments in cinema history, than you have problems. Just add these elements: Super-hot Jennifer Cooke(I was eight-years old when this movie came out, and you can safely say she made puberty start a little early that year.)/ a beefed-up 1977 stirrup-shifted Camaro(need I say more)/ actors who could actually..get this..act!!(an amazing concept for this type of film)/ a great ending(the fiery lake was rockin')/ and an RV with a chrome shifter, blaring out Alice Cooper!! If that's not enough to make you want to see this gem, than I have nothing more to say to you.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
280,dccomics58,I've got the whole Enchillada...,4,16 March 2015,"Friday the 13th part 6 is not a passable film. The acting is terrible at times, most of the dialogue is laughable, and the kills lack suspense. It has a high production value but they repeat the same formula over and over. The character motivations here are very questionable-mostly in the beginning. Whats up with those cops? A guy races in looking for help and you threaten him with a revolver? Saved from a lower ranking solely on artistic merit and Jennifer Cooke. Its an improvement over part 5, but that film was so bad even I could produce something better than with knowledge from some intro film courses I took in college.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
281,zombie84,Its doesnt get any better than this!,10,24 June 2000,"Well,if you didnt like this one, then you wont like any of them. This is without a doubt the best F13 movie to date. Its just kicks ass on so many levels!first the acting. This is Friday the 13Th part 6. You wouldnt expect good acting. but you get it.Granted,its overacted sometimes, but this has the best acting of any of the F13's. Thom Mathews is great as Tommy Jarvis, the slightly wacked-out kid from part 4 and 5 . He gives a believable performance and is probably the best role the series has to offer. The slimy ""bad cop"" Sherrif Garris is nicely over-played by David Kagen but in a good way.The script is good too. Not only is this one of the only Friday the 13th movies where the dialogue is not clumsy and the plot is not full of more holes than Jason is by the end, but its funny too! Some of the deaths are played for laughs and the characters actually have personality. This is one of the few movies in the series where the charcters are not so annoying that you cheer as Jason impales them. The paintball players are a prime example of this. The whole scene is one big joke and it works perfectly with the bouncy army theme played with it.and Jason himself. I dont know why, but he seems really intense in this film. And more human too. Just the things he does in the film that are never matched by any of the others like the scene where he walks through the childrens cabin and kneeles beside the little girl and just watches her.like he is remembering his childhood.And that look he gives the camera when he hold up the arm of the paintaballer,like he gets the joke.There is just that little hint that Jason is still a human under that mask that is so subtle you almost miss it. C.J. Graham's subtle performance as Jason is almost as good as Kane Hodder's animalistic portrayal of Jason in the last few films.the deaths are simple yet extremely effective. they arent the ludicrously elaborate ones in the previous ones but they are done with style, something missing from all the other sequels. the tree face smashing death and the Winnebago scene are examples of this.then there are the creative deaths(*caution: minor spoilers* one man is folded in half the wrong way so that his heels touch the back of his head and another has her face smashed so hard against the inside of a winnebago that her face leaves an imprint in the metal).But for me a big part of what makes this film so good is the suspense created by director Tom McLoughlin. Usually i just watch the F13 movies to see jason beat the crap out of a bunch of annoying college kids, but this time i was like ""look out!behind you!"" and it surprised me. This is one of the few movies in the series where there are genuinely suspenseful moments. There are some amazing sequences in here as well. The opening scene in the cemetary is one of the best openings for any horror movie i have seen.its just so intense and well directed and the pacing is great.The Jason scene in the Winnebago is cleverly crafted and even a bit humerous. Tom McLoughlin even manages to get the people to act.what? acting in a F13 movie? well, its no oscar performance but its good enough for low budget 80's trendy horror. and there is some good music in here too.what more can i say?this is as good as it gets.if you dont like this one then theres no hope of liking any of them.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
282,dannyosull,One of the best horrors I've seen from the 80's.,8,20 May 2006,"From the start in the graveyard, this movie has very few slow moments or times where it lets up. The acting of all characters is surprisingly good and at times deliberately funny. Thom Matthews and Jennifer Cooke really filled their parts well. The lighting throughout the movie, by night, is perfectly balanced and far exceeds the standard as given by Parts 2 & 3. This film never lets up action-wise either.C J Graham has really defined a new Jason in a very menacing, intimidating and ultra Powerful way. That scene where the camper overturns and he climbs out onto the top of it unscathed while it's surrounded by flames is just one example of how awesome a being he has become. The eerie musical scores for scenes like this really do the film justice as well. In general, his reactions and his movements are absolutely perfect to the tee. C J Gramham has really nailed this one. It's a pity he never did Jason again. I also liked that you see Jason a LOT in this movie. It really helps you identify with the main character of the series while it takes away from none of the suspense. The death scenes are well varied and some are well devised.The plot and the flow of the story shows that the director really knew what he was doing. It's very coherent and easy to follow. The ending couldn't have been better. Jarvis set up the trap so well! But even then, Jason was one tough cookie to kill! Even with Megan's help! It's not long drawn out and its just done so well.So, all in all, it really has the elements in place that all the other movies should have.Try and check it out when you can!",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

Tom Mcloghlin brings an interesting direction to the film. And unlike Jason X he stays true to the fans and all that is great about Friday The 13th. And i,ve been a friend of the Friday films since i could walk and this was the first one i saw and is just as good as the fist four films and in my book this and the whole other parts of the series are my favorite movies of all time. Oh and if you like the Friday The 13th films you might wanna check out these other great horror titles Phantasm, Nightmare On Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead and Saw.

285,motherrussia-69884,Average Slasher Film From A Terrible Slasher Franchise,5,31 March 2020,"The film isn't bad or terrible but ultimatley its forgetable , it adds nothing to the genre but adds a great deal to the series as Part 6 : Jason Lives marks a major tone shift for the series for better or worse.See Jason lives is peppered with lots of comedic moments and in all honesty it is more of a comedy - action film than a tradition slasher with was all the movies before 6. The comedy is bad actually its okay alot of the moments land except one near the end and the charaters are likeable which I can't say for films before 6 ( excluding 4 ) as alot of those characters in the earlier films were just jerks.Finally the ultimate problem of this film is that the latter half of the film is meh which is bad as the beginning really showed potential for comedy.The latter half is basically action while the first half is comedy either way it was an enjoyable , forgettable film.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

As always Jason goes on a killing spree.Megans dad believes Tommy is the killer,Jason kills at least 20 people . The only bad thing is lack of gore and no nudity. Several cuts had to be made to avoid an X Rating They were Allens insides were ripped out by Jason. He dragged the guts to were his heart laid steaming. The camp counselors in the car death were trimmed. Darren slid down the spear leaving his insides on it. The paintball players decapitations were trimmed. In the cabin were. Paula gets killed there were shot of entrails going down the walls which was cut for obvious reasons. Sissys death was toned down. mpaa Rating R for profanity a sex scene and graphic violence.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
291,tjakebarnes,One of my favorite Fridays,10,18 October 2008,"This Friday was probably my favorite besides the original of course. It has a strong plot with some really cool death scenes. The acting is actually pretty good compared to all of the other ones. Thom Matthews makes a good cut for Tommy Jarvis. Also I like the setting of this one. It's not like one big cabin and and a small lake in front of it like in part 3. This actually looks like it would be the REAL camp crystal lake. Also there's really cool things that Jason does that really make you fear him. This movie does have a bit of gore in it. But not to much so you'll throw up. Jason uses a variety of different weapons like a pole, a knife, an arrow, and of course his beloved machete. But he also uses his own bare hands in a couple of scenes. So once again this is one of my if not favorite Friday. I would recommend it to any Friday fan or just horror fan.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
292,zzombie13x,The best in the series!,10,29 October 2004,"These movies have always been favorites of mine. They are silly and over the top and they are more equated with an amusement park ride than any other films. That being said, Part 6 is my favorite of the bunch. Why you ask? Because this one is where Jason ceases to be just some guy who is really tough to kill and takes him rightful place as an UBER-ZOMBIE. This is also the Friday where the people making them finally got that there is a specific audience for these films and we don't really care about good acting or great storytelling. We go to these movies for one simple thing, to see Jason hack, slash, maim, and dismember as many foolish campers and Crystal Lake locals as is possible to squeeze into 90 minutes.If you are of the ilk who likes this type of film, Jason 6 is among the best of the bunch. The plot is irrelevant, the bodycount is good (clocking in at 16 deaths), and Jason makes use of some interesting tactic to dispatch his victims. One other notable addition to part 6 that wasn't really implemented in other Jason movies, is a real sense of humor. There are some small but great moments where you can't help but at least chuckle. As i mentioned earlier, this is a movie for the fans. Simple as that. If you aren't into these kinds of films, you will hate it. for those of us who are into these movies this one is a super fun ride that delivers what it sets out to. Non-fans need not apply.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
293,icouldnotthinkofanythingelse,The begin of the ultimate downfall of the series.,2,13 July 2007,"This is my least favorite movie in the series and arguably the worst in the series, besides Jason X.SEVERAL REASONSThe score: I guess they decided to give up on the classy score in the previous films and bring in some ultra-cheesy synth. Why? I don't know.Jarvis: The actor who they chose was HORRIBLE for the part, not to mention just a horrible actor period. Besides, isn't he supposed to be 16-17?The Beginning: Need I say more? OK, so let's forget the creative setup of the last two films and have Tommy Accidentally bring jason back to life because for some reason he felt he had to stick a pole in his chest....just ridiculously stupid.OK...the humor was half-assed, mildly funny anyway. It didn't make up for the total lack of suspense and coherency...but there were a cool few kills...i'll give it that.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives

(Machete, lethal, huge, and not able to die) this movie is the start of Jason's for say... ""re-knewel"" as the king of the Hockey mask himself... it wouldn't be the same if everyone were to watch Freddy vs. Jason and then go and rent Firday the 13th because its not the same Jason that they think of! this film portrays Jason and basically casts his shadow on the true Lethal Hockey Mask slasher... Jason VoorheesThe only thing that made me mad is at the end of A new beginning... Tommy looks like he kills the counselor... and in this movie he talks and is like a good boy! WHAT HAPPENED? I thought that Tommy was gonna be the new Jason or something... but no way Jose' they had to bring Jason back! and i'm happy they did because i missed him!

296,davis_joseph_m,Jason keeps on living.,8,29 March 2006,"Jason Lives is one of the best of this series. Long before ""Scream"" director Tom McLoughlin spoofed horror movies, before it was popular. With the ""Frankeinstein"" way of bringing Jason back to life, to the opening sequence that mocked ""James Bond"". After ""A New Beginning"" the Friday series needed a positive entry into the series to stay alive. Part 6 was scary and very enjoyable. Jason was better and meaner than ever before. This was also the first Friday film to introduce Jason as a zombie back from the dead. We all have to remember by the time this series reached part 6 it was not about a great storyline or anything else any other movie must do before being made. Friday the 13th can break any rules people pay to see Jason slaughter people nothing else. I believe Part 6 is where all that started. Part 6 might not have been the number one movie at the box office, but in 1986 its total when have been around $34.2 million which is pretty good for a series that at that time was only at part 6. Thank god there have been many more. Jason is our 21st century Frankeistein.",Friday the 13th Part VI - Jason Lives
