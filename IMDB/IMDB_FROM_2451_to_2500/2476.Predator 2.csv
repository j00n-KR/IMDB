0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not as good as the first, but a good sequel",8,13 April 2011,"The first Predator is a classic, and I wasn't actually expecting much from this film. But I was surprised, as this film is quite good and much better than the AVP films and the recent film. It mayn't be as efficiently paced, the film could have been shorter and it may lack the sweaty and claustrophobic tension of the original. But there is an atmosphere that does make it a compelling watch, it is quite dark and suspenseful when it needs to be, and while the story isn't quite as interesting it is well-constructed with a broodiness and sensual style that doesn't make the film dull. The dialogue is serviceable, as is the direction, Danny Glover is suitably hard-edged and Gary Busey is interesting as the sinister government official. But it is the spectacular effects and excellent action that drive Predator 2 to a greater level. Overall, a good sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Predator 2
1,Leofwine_draca,Sequel to the classic is a great piece of popcorn entertainment,10,12 October 2016,"It was always going to be a hard job to create a sequel equalling John McTiernan's suspenseful and testosterone-soaked 1987 jungle epic PREDATOR, but somebody had to do it. That somebody was Stephen Hopkins, who fills this 1990 sequel with lots of spooky and creepy alien vision, humour, plenty of hard violence and bad language, and lots and lots of action. The end result is noisy, violent and excessive. As such, it's a very entertaining film to watch and a fine sequel, although in no way can it hope to match up to Schwarzenegger's classic of the science fiction genre. Only in a few scenes - the excellent subway train one in particular - does PREDATOR 2 equal the sheer horror of PREDATOR, instead focusing on plenty of violence and blood in order to outdo the gore of the first film (which is still more shocking).The all-star cast is packed with familiar faces, with Danny Glover and Gary Busey leading the way. Everyday action man Glover at first seems to be an odd replacement for Schwarzenegger, but he grows on you as the film progresses, delivering his lines with relish and creating a sweaty, human hero. Busey in comparison has great fun as a slimy villain, a man who hopes to catch the Predator in a stalk-and-slash sequence which involves video monitors and is clearly inspired by a similar moment in ALIENS. Basically, Busey is playing the same villainous character as he has done in all his other films in the past three decades, except with a little more humanity this time.Lower down in the cast, we have Ruben Blades as Danny, Glover's Hispanic buddy who becomes an early victim for the Predator; Maria Conchita Alonso as Leona, a female officer; a still very young-looking Bill Paxton as Jerry, a sexist cop full of bad jokes; and finally Adam Baldwin (who stars in loads of films in unmemorable roles) as Busey's right-hand man at the top of the conspiracy. Even further down in the cast, there are minor turns from the likes of Robert Davi as an FBI man (again!), Charles Napier, and Calvin Lockhart (THE BEAST MUST DIE) as the exceedingly odd Jamaican drug lord King Willie. The exceptionally tall Kevin Peter Hall, of course, plays the Predator, an old hand at this kind of thing since he first appeared in THE WARNING back in 1980. Unfortunately this turned out to be his last screen role before his death.PREDATOR 2 is not one of those forward-thinking films which set future worlds far in the future, beyond our lifetimes. Instead this film's future is set in 1997, so already it is dated. Don't expect any futuristic landscapes, however, as things are just the same as they were in 1990, except perhaps a little more violent as seen in the exceptional set-piece opening of the movie, a street war between drugged-up wackos and the entire police force of Los Angeles. There's even a media-satire angle in the film which was done first - and better - in ROBOCOP. The first half of this film is standard cop thriller, with Glover's unorthodox methods leading him to fall foul of his superiors. The second half, from the subway train sequence, is basically one long action scene shifting from location to location, set-piece to set-piece.The film is packed with explosions and tons of violence, heads being torn off, brains being sucked out, and millions of people being slaughtered and shot apart. Such sights are countered by scenes of broad comedy, like when the Predator finds himself in an old woman's bathroom and she comes to fight him with a broom. The action and shooting bits are well-staged and generally exciting though. The ending disappointed a lot of fans by being a bit anti-climatic and twisting things around with the introduction of a whole family of Predators, but I liked it personally - it offered up an unexpected surprise on first viewing. PREDATOR 2 is a great popcorn movie and one I wouldn't change a scene of.",Predator 2
2,SnoopyStyle,weak sequel but not all bad,6,15 November 2014,"Los Angeles is a gangland warzone and LAPD lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) is in the middle of it all with his team Danny Archuleta (Rubén Blades), and Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso). However Mike encounters an unexplainable invisible presence. The bloody gangland feud is actually the work of the Predator. Captain Phil Heinemann (Robert Davi) pulls them off the case and mouthy newcomer Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton) is assigned to his team. DEA agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) takes over and he keeps pushing them away from the case.The movie is loud for the sake of being loud. There is definitely good action and there is no sense of subtlety. It starts by turning L.A. into a wild shooting gallery, adds a splash of voodoo, and puts Glover in the center of it all. Glover does a good job but he's no Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's not a particularly good movie but it's not bad either.",Predator 2
3,classicsoncall,"""What you're dealing with is way over your head.""",6,19 January 2016,"I can't come up with a legitimate reason why this film was made. It does nothing to advance the Predator mythology, where they came from, why they're here, etc. We eventually find out that they hunt for the sport of it, but that's not really demonstrable here, contrary to what I see some other reviewers rave about. The main Predator here seems to be focused on a territorial gang war in the heart of Los Angeles, but doesn't seem constrained to taking out just the bad guys. He's an equal opportunity killer who picks his targets and puts them all away with equal impunity, drug lords, cops and civilians alike. The idea that Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) gets to go one on one with a Predator and come up victorious seemed like an over the top stretch to me, and all the relentless action without a meaningful story just wore out it's welcome after a while. It wasn't until the full complement of Predators made their presence felt at the end of the story that I figured out why they primarily went after the Jamaican drug gang. I think it had to do with who had the better looking dreadlocks.",Predator 2
4,jboothmillard,Predator 2,3,28 June 2005,"I remember seeing this once before, and probably thinking it was rally good, but a second viewing was a good idea, from director Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, The Reaping). Basically in Los Angeles there is a big gang war between the Jamaicans led by voodoo high priest King Willie (Calvin Lockhart) and the Colombians led by Ramon Vega (Corey Rand), and Detective Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) is trying to stop it. Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) partners him with cocky Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), and they are investigating the recent killings in the city. Of course they find out that the murders are not being committed by gang members, in fact the whole city is under threat from an extra-terrestrial danger. Forensics prove that the deaths were caused by an alien creature, The Predator (Kevin Peter Hall) who has returned to Earth with his infra-red vision and shoulder cannon and blades to hunt and kill humans for trophies (skulls, etc). Also starring Rubén Blades as Danny Archuleta, Maria Conchita Alonso as Leona Cantrell, Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Captain Phil Heinemann, Independence Day's Adam Baldwin as Garber, Kent McCord as Captain B. Pilgrim and Morton Downey Jr. as Tony Pope. The casting of actors like Glover and Paxton doesn't really do much, the city setting is no comparison to the jungle, there is hardly any decent violence, all in all it is a bit of a boring watch, a silly science-fiction action thriller. Adequate!",Predator 2
5,Woodyanders,An enjoyably over-the-top sequel to the excellent original,8,20 January 2007,"This jaunty, ultra-violent sequel to the top-drawer original has the titular nasty extraterrestrial (the massive Kevin Peter Hall; the murderous mutant bear in ""Prophecy"") hunting for hapless'n'helpless human prey in bleakly futuristic Los Angeles, which by 1997 has been turned into a brutal and chaotic urban war zone hell that's practically run by two opposing drug cartels. Out to bag the pernicious intergalactic fiend are loose cannon maverick cop Mike Harrison (a game portrayal by Danny Glover) and arrogant military scientist Keyes (a typically lively performance by the ever-crazed Gary Busey).Although completely predictable and pretty mindless, ""Predator 2"" nonetheless still sizes up as an enjoyably over-the-top sci-fi/action item thanks to Stephen Hopkins' brisk, stylish direction, first-rate make-up f/x by Stan Winston, a stirring score by Alan Silvestri, wall-to-wall in-your-face explosive action set pieces, a breathless frenetic pace, and plenty of excessive graphic splatter. The capable and interesting supporting cast qualifies as another substantial asset: Ruben Blades as Harrison's amiable partner Danny, Maria Conchita Alonso as foulmouthed female flatfoot Leona, the always delightfully dynamic Bill Paxton as cocksure badge bandit Jerry Lambert, Robert Davi as jerk fed Heineman, Calvin Lockhart as flamboyant Jamaican drug lord King Willie (his back alley confrontation with the Predator is one of the picture's definite highlights), veteran character actress Lilyan Chauvan (Mother Superior in the splendidly sleazy sicko Santa slasher classic ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"") as a stern coroner (Lilyan easily cops the film's best line when she explains that one victim was ""boned like a fish""), and, in an especially adroit piece of casting, infamously odious tabloid TV talk show host Morton Downey, Jr. as obnoxious loudmouth reporter Tony Pope. Foxy popular porn star Teri Weigel briefly appears clad solely in her birthday suit. Good, trashy fun.",Predator 2
6,Tweekums,A predator is hunting in the city of Los Angeles,6,8 February 2016,"In 'Predator' Arnold Schwarzenegger and a group of elite commandos found themselves up against an alien predator in a remote South American jungle this time it is Danny Glover and some cops against a predator in the city of Los Angeles. It is a hot summer and the predator has been drawn to the war between rival drug-gangs which the police are struggling to deal with. Glover plays Lieutenant Mike Harrigan; a tough cop who realises that something strange is going on; a group of heavily armed gangsters are wiped out by something that doesn't appear to have been armed. He is determined to get to the bottom of it but is ordered to stay away when federal agent Peter Keyes appears on the scene. Inevitably the predator strikes again and it isn't long before one of Harrigan's team is killed and he won't be the last. The slaughter continues until Harrigan confronts the predator in a fight that only one of them will survive.After an enjoyable first instalment this sequel is a bit disappointing it isn't bad; just not as good as the first. Danny Glover is a good lead but doesn't have the presence of Arnie. This problem is even greater for the rest of the protagonists; the first film had the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and Jesse Ventura while here we have Rubén Blades, Bill Baxton and Maria Conchita Alonso and the last of these is the toughest! Gary Busey is pretty solid as Keyes even if his character is a little cliché. They try to make up for the lack of tough characters with some fairly forced comedy. If you can ignore the flaws there is a lot of over the top action; most of it fairly bloody and it does build nicely on the events of the previous film even if there are no returning characters. Overall this is an okay action film that fans of the previous film will probably enjoy; just not as much.",Predator 2
7,ma-cortes,"Acceptable sequel in which the bloody alien has inexplicably returned to L.A , taking on a motley group of polices",6,26 February 2014,"Exciting and thrilling motion picture in which a varied group of polices must fight an evil alien in the big city . Amidst a territorial gang-war, a sophisticated alien hunter (Kevin Peter Hall , he had studied African tribal dances in order to get into the feel and flexibility and to give him a personality) stalks the citizens of Los Angeles and the only man between him and his prey is veteran LAPD officer, Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover ,at one point Arnold Schwarzenegger was going to co-star in the film, but chose to do Terminator 2) , being only helped by his underlings (Maria Conchita Alonso , Ruben Blades , Bill Paxton). This nail-biting picture contains action-packed from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , emotion and entertainment . Action movie told in terms of urban warfare in which a misfit bunch formed by Policia and FBI agents battle a malicious extraterrestrial . This is a brutal , violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of previous Predator film . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . The ending part is particularly exciting stuff though it makes no great sense . With more time than the original film , Stan Winston, Stephen Hopkins and Lawrence G. Paull came up with ideas and designs with more exotic weapons such as the retractable spear, the detachable pincers, the Frisbee blade, the net, etc. for the Predator to use to differentiate this film from the previous one . Interesting script by Jim Thomas and John Thomas , the original storyline of the film was to have taken place in New York City, but writers quickly changed it to Los Angeles because of budget concerns , as the scene where the Predator raises the skull during the lighting storm was to have taken place atop the Chrysler Building . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughterhouse sequence took about four days to shoot and was extremely difficult, according to director Stephen Hopkins, due to the amount of water used and the lighting of the sequence . Very good cast such as Danny Glover , Bill Paxton , Ruben Blades , Maria Conchita Alonso , Adam Baldwin , Kent McCord , Robert Davi and Gary Busey . Excellent makeup by professional expert , Kevin Westmore , and magnificent FX , especially the semi-invisibility which was well realized . Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Alan Silvestri ; Alan was quoted as saying that his score will be influenced by prior original score for the 1987 film . In fact , the final credit is heard the classical soundtrack by Alan Silvestri from Predator I . Colorful cinematography but sometimes dark by Peter Levy , and all the main locations were filmed in Los Angeles . The motion picture was professionally directed by Stephen Hopkins , though clearly inferior to prior part . However , the film was re-cut over 20 times, according to director Stephen Hopkins, because of more graphic shots of mutilated bodies and decapitations by the Predator. Other films about Predator series are the following : The original and the best ¨Predator¨ (1987) in which Arnold leads a team of CIA-hired mercenaries into the Central American jungles , being filmed by John McTiernan with Arnold Schwarzanegger , Jesse Ventura , Bill Duke , R.G. Armstrong , Carl Weathers , Elpidia Carrillo who appears briefly in ¨Predators II¨. Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy .

8,BA_Harrison,Los Angeles has a serious illegal alien problem.,8,6 February 2010,"John McTiernan's sci-fi/action/horror hybrid Predator was a virtually flawless exercise in testosterone fuelled, gung-ho action and nerve jangling, jungle-based tension which benefited immensely from star Arnold Schwarzenegger's impressive on-screen presence. Who else but seven times Mr. Olympia title winner Arnie could feasibly take on a huge 7ft tall extraterrestrial hunter and emerge victorious?Apart from Danny Glover, of course. That's right, 'I'm too old for this s**t' Murtaugh, Mad Mel's ageing sidekick from Lethal Weapon.Amazingly, that is who is pitted against the ugly alien trophy hunter in Predator 2; and yet somehow, despite this unusual casting choice, this sequel still manages to be extremely entertaining stuff, largely thanks to a no-holds barred approach by director Stephen Hopkins, who packs his film with explosive, non-stop action set-pieces and a large helping of gruesome gore.Set in the very near future (1997), the film sees an alien hunting humans in the urban jungle of Los Angeles, focusing its attention on the city's Colombian and Jamaican gang members, who are involved in a territorial war. When Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Glover) leads an investigation into the mysterious deaths of several Colombians, he not only comes between the hunter and his prey, but also upsets a shady government plan to capture the creature in order to study its advanced technology.Although this plot might not be as lean as the original's, it does offer an exciting new arena for the action, plus a variety of colourful characters for the predator to kill and display in his trophy cabinet: there's the despicable Colombian and Jamaican gang members, of course, all of whom are larger-than-life caricatures well deserving of the nasty deaths that they receive; then there are Harrigan's doomed police buddies, Danny (Rubén Blades) and Jerry (Bill Paxton) whose deaths serve to give our hero a good reason to risk life and limb for revenge; and last, but definitely not least, we have the brilliant Gary Busey as federal agent Peter Keyes, who has 'dead' written all over him from the start.Inevitably, the action all boils down to a prolonged fight between Harrigan and the skull-plucking, spine-ripping alien, with the brave cop eventually tracking the monster to its spaceship for a final showdown. It's at this point that Glover feels most miscast in his role: if Arnie's highly trained, muscle-bound special forces commando Dutch barely survived his close encounter, what chance would an LA street cop have? This minor quibble aside, however, Predator 2 still provides the spills and thrills I demanded, throws in some rather cool touches along the way (xenomorph skull, anyone?), and is generally a much better movie than many would have you believe.",Predator 2
9,paul_haakonsen,The hunter has come to the city...,6,18 December 2015,"For a sequel, then the 1990 released ""Predator 2"" movie was actually quite alright, and did manage to live up quite well to the predecessor movie from 1987. And while director Stephen Hopkins had changed the setting from an actual jungle to the urban jungle was a choice that he executed quite nicely, because it really did work nicely on the screen.The story in ""Predator 2"" is not a continuation of the first movie, nor did it really have any particular ties to the first movie, aside from the predator creature and concept - at least to what I observed.There is a great amount of action in the movie, just as in the first movie. But actually they upped it from the first movie to a more intense level. So be prepared for a lot more gunfire.The urban setting was at first a somewhat odd choice, but it really, really worked quite well, and it was a thrill to have the movie set in a sprawling city.As for the acting, well, while the cast list really holds some great names in each their own right, then I wasn't that particularly thrilled about Danny Glover for the lead part. He is not a bad actor, don't get me wrong, I just have problems with seeing him as a proper action actor. Kevin Peter Hall returns for his formidable predator performance once again.""Predator 2"" is essentially action-packed from the very beginning and up to the very end, with heaps of action and thrills in between.As with the previous movie, then the special effects team handled their job formidably and presented some great eye-candy for the audience. The predator design is so wonderful and there were some really nice treats in the details once we went inside their spaceship.An entertaining movie with just a few minor bumps along the way, but quite well worth a place in the ""Predator"" franchise.",Predator 2
10,michaelRokeefe,"Close to being rediculous, but entertaining",8,7 September 2020,"The Predator, after a decade, comes to the mean streets of LA, gang violence is rampant and cops under leadership of Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) haven't a clue how to end the body count. Secret government troops, under command of Peter Keys (Gary Busey), doesn't do any better calming the mayhem. Brutal violence enough to go around. Also featured: Ruben Blades, Maria Conchita Alonso, Adam Baldwin, Bill Paxton and Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator.",Predator 2
11,hitchcockthelegend,Very undervalued sequel suffering because of the first films success.,8,30 April 2008,"Los Angeles is imploding with mayhem as gang wars fill the streets, an under pressure police force try to restore order, but both parties have another foe to worry about, a Predator is in town, and he's about to up the ante.Gone is Arnold Schwarzenegger, gone is John McTiernan, and gone is the jungle setting, so following in the foot steps of the ultimate beefcake movie that was Preadtor 1987 was an unenviable task it seems. Yet I personally feel that Predator 2 stands up to scrutiny as a fine entry into the sci-fi/action genre. Locating it among the urban decay of L.A. works real well, and pitting the Predator against a tough grizzled (but hardly giganticus beefcakeus) cop (Danny Glover) gives us a smart brains against brawn story. Also cutely is that director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim & John Thomas have actually got the Predator cleaning up the streets of L.A., in fact another two hours of Predator hunt and kill tactics and crime in L.A. would have been completely eradicated! There is plenty of bloody snotty gore to appease fans of that persuasion, and it's nice to report that the characters on show do actually impact as part of the story.Voodoo magic man!It has a fine cast that reads like a who's who of action films, Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Robert Davi (Die Hard), Gary Busey (Under Siege), Rubén Blades (Once Upon a Time in Mexico) & Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man), whilst Kevin Peter Hall dons the Predator suit and suitably kicks arse again. It's not genius, it's not even ground breaking, but Predator 2 is a fine and entertaining genre piece that sadly seems to forever be undervalued on internet forums.Who's Next? 8/10",Predator 2
12,Theo Robertson,Certainly Better Than Its Ill Deserved Reputation,7,26 April 2008,"PREDATOR 2 is a strange type of sequel . It doesn't feature any of the characters from the original movie which probably explains its box office failure . You can just imagine an audience squealing with delight when the studio let it be known there was going to be a follow up to the first film , only for the audience to weep in disappointment when they found out it was starring Danny Glover rather than Big Arnie . Sequels without the original characters never seem to do well as the recent 28 WEEKS LATER show ( It's a much better film than is given credit for ) but I think the producers deserve some congratulations for trying something different Certainly this movie gets off to an explosive start with the LAPD in a shoot out with a Latino drugs gang and it's safe to say that both the pyrotechnic and stunt team earned their money with this shoot . Like the original this is an action/adventure film and there can be no complaints that this is a boring movie . Stephen Hopkins directing may be slightly uneven but he does very well in some scenes such as the aforementioned opening , the metro sequence and the scene where a decapitation takes place overdubbed with the character's screams as his head is carried away . The violence may be more "" ugly "" in the words of Roger Ebert but I preferred this more than the comic strip violence of the original . My only real criticism is that the ending is rather flat compared than what went before All in all a rather enjoyable movie for those audiences who are in to action adventures and SF . It's a hugely under rated movie which people should judge for what it is rather than what it's not . Okay it doesn't have Arnie blowing away lots of bad guys but when you compare it to these dire ALIENS V PREDATOR movies it's actually quite good and hopefully now its reputation will go up slightly",Predator 2
13,Scarecrow-88,Predator 2,6,10 December 2010,"The Predator warrior alien in on another safari for human skulls and this time its playground is the LA streets with cop Danny Glover and military man Gary Busey both wanting to catch him for different reasons. The plot includes Jamaiican drug lords, subway thugs, and a military interest in the Predator warrior's weapons technology. Director Stephan Hopkins(A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET V) essentially directs this PREDATOR film like a Die Hard/Lethal Weapon with an alien warrior the enemy instead of drug pushers or weapons dealers. Danny Glover is pretty much Murtaugh from LETHAL WEAPON without the family or Mel Gibson, only thing missing is ""I'm getting too old for this sh#t."" You know, though, I kind of like the idea of a hardened, seasoned narcotics cop as the Predator's opposition, instead of the usual titan of muscle, some trained assassin, or a soldier of fortune. The problem I personally had with this film is the murky and dark moments where we can not see any of the violence or action, such as the awful ""strobe lights"" subway massacre as the Predator causes mayhem and death towards civilians and punks on board(or the meat packing factory towards the end when Busey and his para-military men seek to ""freeze"" the Predator with liquid nitrogen, as to seize and study it). Bill Paxton has a really obnoxious cop character quite similar to dorky roles like in WEIRD SCIENCE before stepping to the plate for more complex dramatic roles as he matured as an actor. Robert Davi is wasted in a minor part as Glover's superior, warning him to tone down his ""John Wayne"" routine. Ruben Blades and Maria Conchita Alonzo have supporting parts as members of Glover's team, soon, like Paxton, coming in contact with the Predator. The trophy room(which houses the memorable skull of an alien xenomorph) and ""cauterized"" wound sequence(where the Predator has to repair a wound due to Glover severing its arm which contained the auto destruct device) are two of my favorite moments in the film. Hopkins has some very impressive virtuoso camera movements such as when Glover is on a ledge as the Predator holds on to his arm or following a chase from the street to the tops of buildings, eventually leading into an elevator shaft, finally ending with the duel between cop and alien inside the creature's ship. I loved how Glover uses the Predator's own weapon against it, the circular blade which resembles a type of boomerang.",Predator 2
14,Hey_Sweden,"You can't see the eyes of the demon, 'til him come calling.",7,7 June 2018,"Writers Jim Thomas & John Thomas take their formidable alien hunter character from one kind of jungle to another, in this tale of gang warfare in 1997 L.A. The Colombians and Jamaicans wage bloody battles, with each other and the cops, and one good cop (Danny Glover) and his cronies are frustrated that they can't seem to make headway. This is really an ideal environment for the Predator; it will have no shortage of worthy targets.Expect a lot of bloodshed, a lot of weaponry, and a lot of in-your-face action in this lively sequel that portrays a slightly futuristic Los Angeles that is quite over the top in terms of violence. It begins with a genuine bang, and rarely offers let-ups - the pacing is definitely first-rate. It does harken back to the first film at times, and also strongly echoes ""Aliens"" towards the end. It does also take viewers a little further into the culture of the Predators, and teased fans with the possibility of a future ""Predator"" / ""Alien"" mash-up with the sight of a Xenomorph skull in a Predator trophy room (this, of course, first came to pass 14 years later).Glover is fairly amusing in a VERY intense, profane portrayal, with Ruben Blades and Maria Conchita Alonso offering fine support. Gary Busey is good as the shady government man who claims to be with the D.E.A. but in fact has a different agenda altogether. Bill Paxton typically steals his scenes in a very Private Hudson-esque performance. Kevin Peter Hall once again plays the murderous title creature, in what was sadly one of his final performances. Morton Downey, Jr. is appropriately cast as a sleazy, loudmouthed journalist. Calvin Lockhart has a regrettably brief cameo as Jamaican drug lord King Willie. Other familiar faces like Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin, Kent McCord, Steve Kahan, Henry Kingi, Lilyan Chauvin, and Teri Weigel also turn up.Composer Alan Silvestri doesn't just repeat himself here, which is good; he expands upon his familiar themes from the original film. And the production design by Lawrence G. Paull is top notch, both in terms of the crime-ridden L.A. streets and the design of the Predator spacecraft.It's of course not meant to be innovative in the slightest. It's just good, tough, straightforward, hard-edged action entertainment.Seven out of 10.",Predator 2
15,LeonLouisRicci,"Lacks the Poetic Charm of the OriginalLoud, Inelegant, & Blustery",5,4 January 2016,"This Sequel came (lost money) and went with Critical and Fan Disapproval. The Original was a Powerful, Poetic, and Beautifully Photographed Jungle Adventure with Horror-Sci-Fi overtones, extreme Action, and one of the Great Movies of its Era. Perhaps Arnold's Best.This one was and is a major Disappointment. The Tone of the Thing is Ugly, Loud, and Crass from the very Beginning. The Movie never settled down and continued to Irritate and Annoy for most of the Running Time. Danny Glover is Miscast and Beyond His Capabilities, Bill Paxton is slightly Amusing but Over-Acts to the extreme, Gary Busey is OK but hardly saves the Movie. The rest of the Cast go through the motions and are Unremarkable.The Ending was the Best part Visually as it took a breath and Restrained from the Shouting and Over-the-Top Antics and let the Film Glide to a more Natural Conclusion. But most of the Film is so Obnoxious, with Ear Piercing Dialog and Less than Involving Shoot-Em-Ups.Most of the Characters are Unlikable and get on the Nerves, both the Cops and Criminals. The Movie Lacks Elegance and Barely Passes as Entertainment. Only the most Calloused Action Fans and Forgiving Sci-Fi Types will garner any Enjoyment out of this mostly Mishandled and Semi-Failure. Average and Typical at best.",Predator 2
16,poolandrews,"""It's a war zone down here Dave!' Decent sequel but not as good as the original.",7,8 April 2006,"Predator 2 starts in 'Los Angeles 1997' where Colombian & Jamaican gangs of drug dealers have turned the streets into a war zone with shoot outs & executions a seemingly daily occurrence. Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) & his team, Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso) & new boy Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton) are on the front line fighting against the terror these gangs bring to the streets. However there seems to be a new player in town, a new kind of killer loose, a killer without mercy, without motive, without discrimination & one who loves to kill. Harrigan & his team have nothing to go on except a spear head made from a material that is unknown on Earth & the sudden appearance of shadowy FBI figure Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) & his team of men who seem very interested in capturing whoever or whatever is responsible for these brutal killings. It's not long before Harrigan realises that what he is up against is not of this planet, it's the ultimate killing machine, it's the ultimate predator...Directed by Stephen Hopkins I thought Predator 2 was a good solid sci-fi/horror/action film but was not as good as the original Predator (1987) which had the perfect blend of blood, guts, big guns, testosterone, one-liners, action & explosions. I cannot say the same for Predator 2, unfortunately. The script by Jim & John Thomas shifts the action from the jungles of Central America to the urban jungle of Los Angeles which is my first problem, I just thought that the hunter/prey situation worked so much better in the isolated harsh jungle than the sprawling city of Los Angeles. Danny Glover is no Arnold Schwarzenegger in the running around with a big gun blowing things up stakes & they just had to include the clichéd misguided scientist who wants to capture the predator so we can study it. Also, if these FEDS were so clever why did they leave the only piece of information that could lead Harrigan to them & the predator on the computer for that pathologist to find & yet manage to completely delete everything else? Having said that Predator 2 is a good film, it moves along at a nice pace, has one or two decent action scenes & provides solid entertainment.Director Hopkins could have done a better job, for a start just having people randomly fire guns at nothing in particular is neither exciting or original & I actually thought the action scenes lacked a certain spark & seemed a little dull even down to an almost incomprehensible train sequence in which you can barely tell what's happening because it's set amidst flickering lights. Danny Glover looked a bit old & out of shape as well as he tries to do a Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon (1987), wasn't Glover purposely the old slow one in the Lethal Weapon films? Apparently Predator 2 was cut down to get a lower rating so don't expect buckets of blood or gore, there are some skinned bodies, a decapitated head, someone is cut with a razor wire net, people are impaled on spears & there are plenty of gunshot wounds but there's nothing here overly nasty.Technically Predator 2 is great & has that big budget Hollwood polish to it, the special effects hold up well even today & the predator creature is just plain cool, isn't it? A lot of the original's music is reused here which also seemed out of place & inappropriate at times. Predator 2 has a fine cast which it wastes, Paxton is always watchable, Robert Davi is criminally underused although Conchita Alonso annoyed me with her hairstyle & irritating accent.Predator 2 is a good film of that there is no doubt but I much prefer the original, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Definitely worth a watch though as I think most would enjoy it.",Predator 2
17,zardoz-13,Not as Good as The Original But Good Enough to Pass Muster,8,6 October 2018,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"" director Stephen Hopkins took over ""Predator 2"" with an entirely new cast toplining Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Gary Busey, and Maria Conchita Alonso, when both director John McTiernan and original star Arnold Schwarzenegger went thumbs down on the sequel. Mind you, ""Predator 2"" qualifies as a better-than-average follow-up, but other than Kevin Peter Hall who suited up again as the space alien, nobody else reprised their roles. Meantime, ""Predator"" co-scenarists Jim and John Thomas who penned the original shifted the action seven years into the future and set it in Los Angeles where Latino gangs were at war with a gang of voodoo dopers. Like the original film, the temperature has risen above 100 degrees, and a horde of new Predators have arrived to contend with the bloodthirsty drug lords that have turned the City of Angels upside down with one bloodbath after another. LAPD Detective Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover of ""Lethal Weapon"") and his crew of detectives are up to their necks in violence and mayhem. Just as they are about to solve the mysterious slaying taking place, Harrigan is ordered to stand down by his superior, Captain Phil Heinemann (Robert Davi of ""License to Kill"") when an enigmatic Federal Investigator, Peter Keyes (Gary Busey of ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot""), shows up to take over the investigator. Harrigan is about as insubordinate as any formulaic cop can get, and he doesn't let jurisdictional interference get in his way, particularly after his closest friend and fellow crime-fighter, LAPD Detective Danny Archuleta (Rubén Blades of ""The Two Jakes""), is killed by this alien. The saving grace of ""Predator 2"" is that we learn more about the Predators, and we see the chief Predator behave like John Jay Rambo after Harrigan surprisingly cuts off one of its forearms and the intruder has to medicate himself in an apartment bathroom while the occupants of the apartment are watching ""Jeopardy"" on television. Indeed, the Thomas siblings show us the interior of the Predator's spaceship. Not only does our hero kill the Predator with one of its own weapons, but he also blunders into the spaceship and encounters several other imposing Predators. The biggest surprise of ""Predator 2"" occurs during the finale when these monsters allow Harrigan to live and hand him a flintlock black powder pistol with the year 1715 inscribed on it. Hopkins keeps the action hustling and bustling with Harrigan and Keyes at each other's throats when they aren't dealing with the indestructible ""Predator."" Bill Paxton enters the arena as another LAPD detective who has transferred into the war-zone precinct and tries to sweet-talk LAPD Detective Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso of ""Extreme Prejudice""), but she seizes him by the genitals and warns him to back off. ""Predator 2"" does more for the Predators than the human heroes and Glover and company emerge as driven detectives. My favorite scenes are the bathroom scene when the Predator tends his wounds and later when Harrigan confronts the Predators in their spaceship. ""Predator 2"" also shows audiences the interior of the aliens' spaceship and some of the trophies on display are none other than the Xenomorphs from the ""Alien"" franchise. Later, Twentieth Century Fox spun off both franchises with two ""Alien Vs Predator"" chillers. Grafting a Predator movie onto a conventional, no-holds-barred urban police thriller wasn't the greatest premise, but ""Predator 2"" amounted to an above-average epic.",Predator 2
18,Boba_Fett1138,Average sequel to a fantastic first movie.,7,8 August 2011,"This movie is disliked not so much because it's a bad movie but more so because it never becomes nowhere nearly close to the level of excellence of the first 1987 movie. But lets be honest, this movie is not bad at all, especially not when compared to other similar genre attempts.Still they did plenty wrong with this movie and made some serious bad steps. First of all; its settings. The jungle playground has this time been replaced by a large city. Yes, I get it, the city is often regarded as an asphalt and concrete jungle but that is just a figure of speech, no need to take it as literally as they did in this movie. Its settings already take so much away from its concept, that still made the first movie such a strong one.But also the hunting game of the Predator himself seems to have changed this time. Yes, this in itself is also partly due to the fact that it's being set in Los Angeles, that of course is being inhabited by millions of people. How can you effectively play an hunting game in it? No matter were you go, there are always people, so it's easy to kill. And that also seems what the Predator is doing in this movie; he just randomly kills people, without really toying with them first, or put any real effort into it. This takes away so much of the tension already and is part of the reason why this movie really isn't half as effective as the first movie.But what perhaps even more troubled me was that the roles were more or less reversed this time. The main character is after the Predator, instead of the other way around. As a matter of fact, the predator doesn't even seem aware of the Danny Glover character, until half way through or so. Because of this the movie for large part is lacking a real sense of danger, which again, takes away so much of the movie its tension.Another mistake they made was that they showed the Predator way too early on. He's in the first few minutes of the movie and gets fully shown, pretty much right away. The Predator is supposed to be a, literally, invisible hunter, who strikes out of nowhere. No need to show him all the time, in order to make him a scary killer and monster. They really wanted to show off way too much with the Predator this time and all of his cool new weapons.Typical sequel stuff. It tries to desperately to be bigger and better than the first movie, while it's actually involving a totally different cast and crew this time, which already makes this feel like a totally different movie from the first one. I'm not saying that John McTiernan (the director of the first movie) is a brilliant director but his touch was perfect for ""Predator"", while Stephen Hopkins is a director who has basically never surpassed the level of average, with any of his movies.But that's all the negative stuff. The movie still has plenty of redeeming qualities in it. The story is quite weak but at least it's entertaining and ensures that the movie never becomes a boring one. There is plenty happening and the movie also has some amusing and good characters in it, played by some fine actors. Yes, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Bill Paxton and Robert Davi all play some very typical roles for them but that's simply what they are good at and is why their characters work out and become entertaining ones. And like I said before; just compare this movie to any other genre attempt and you have to conclude that this movie is simply a good and enjoyable movie for what is is.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Predator 2
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"I realize that the thing's invisible, but you still missed the mark",6,14 May 2008,"Following up on a film the effect of which was largely based upon not seeing the entity that we dread, and slowly building up to showing it/him, is not an easy task... just look at the Halloween sequels(if you can stand the sight). Well, you don't have to. Still, it really ought to be possible to do better than this(and I say that without even caring that much for the first). Clichés are introduced right from the start of this. This tries so hard to be cool(to live up to its predecessor, presumably) that just about every character(and the ones who inhabit this tend to, in general, be difficult to take seriously) who actually has lines delivers at least one ""badass"" quote, and yes, that does get every bit as ridiculous to watch as it sounds like it might. The plot doesn't measure up to the first, and the fact that someone watched Aliens, and really, really liked it(be it a writer, either the one with the unfortunate name or his brother, or the director) shows, and I don't mean that in the meaning that it is noticeable, but more ""show"" as in something you'd be charged a fee to enter, and once you enter the large, colorful tent, you'll view such sights as dancing animals and acrobats. It's tough to ignore. The pacing is decent. This has something the first didn't stoop to: a sex scene. Pleasing the young male demographic at the cost of potential sophistication. I'm not going to claim that the first was some piece of art, but still. The acting varies. There are good things herein: the effects improved since last time around. Weaponry is expanded. Hall is still spot-on(R.I.P.). There is plenty of action, and it's mostly nicely done, not to mention shot and edited well. This isn't bad, it's just not that far from average. I recommend this to fans of Predator, the creature as well as the movie. 6/10",Predator 2
20,neil-476,The suits succeed,9,25 April 2010,"Most of the time the suits in Hollywood play it safe and go for the lowest common denominator - ""This worked, so we'll do it again."" Every now and then, though, they increase the risk element and, sometimes, they come a cropper.So picture the discussion: ""That Schwarzenegger movie - ""Predator"" - that did well. Let's make another one."" ""Great. Let's sign up Schwarzenegger and find another jungle."" ""I've got a better idea. We already established that these things hunt for entertainment - why don't we have one hunting in a city instead? Cheaper to shoot in a city."" ""OK. But how would we get the Schwarzenegger character to a city?"" ""Even simpler. Don't have him - have someone else. Cheaper still. More to spend on those cool camouflage effects."" ""But without a star - "" ""Oh, we've got a star. The Predator."" Maybe the conversation didn't go exactly like that, but that's pretty much the result - a fairly modern day urban sci-fi action thriller.And it's pretty good, too - there's a decent story, it rockets along nicely, the cast and effects are all good.This is an excellent sequel and a very good film.",Predator 2
21,Uriah43,Welcome to the Jungle,6,30 August 2016,"Ten years have passed since the alien creature that hunted the mercenaries in the Central American jungle was killed. Now another one is back--but this time he has chosen the urban environment of Los Angeles as his hunting ground. And as luck would have it, Los Angeles just happens to be in the middle of a major gang war between the Columbians and the Jamaicans when he arrives. To deal with this sudden crisis between the two rival drug gangs, a police officer named ""Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan"" (Danny Glover) has been assigned this case but what he doesn't count on is an alien creature getting involved, who not only presents another serious problem, but his presence also results in a special government agency with a top-secret clearance and a plan to bring this creature in-preferably alive. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that although Danny Glover performed in a fine manner he didn't quite measure up to Arnold Schwarzenegger's standard in the previous movie. But the action was still pretty good and having supporting actors like Gary Busey (as ""Special Agent Peter Keyes""), Bill Paxton (""Officer Jerry Lambert"") and the attractive Maria Conchita Alonso (""Officer Leona Cantress"") certainly benefited this movie as well. In short, although it wasn't quite as good as the preceding film, it was still entertaining enough and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Predator 2
22,AaronCapenBanner,Miscast Sequel.,5,27 August 2013,"Arnold Schwarzenegger was unable to reprise his role of Dutch in Part II, so who should be cast to oppose a new Predator menace, this time in the urban jungle of Los Angeles in the near-future, where rival drug gangs are being decimated by the predators? How about...Danny Glover! Ridiculous you say? Yes it is, but that doesn't stop it from happening of course! Glover is game, I give him credit there, but he just isn't a believable opponent for the Predator, since in reality, he would have been dispatched quickly, not having the training or bulk of Dutch; instead he survives because the script says he does, or because he was just lucky! Could have been a decent sequel otherwise, but needed more story preparation as well, though the ending is good.",Predator 2
23,FlashCallahan,Want some Ganja Man?.....,7,6 April 2013,"Harrigan is a cop fighting the good war against drugs. But recently, the major drug lords have been killed off in a very brutal fashion. His superiors tell him to stay out of it, but Harrigan knows that something is wrong. His instincts are right when he discovers that the person behind the murders is none other than a human-hunting alien who likes to make trophies out of his victims' skulls. But how can Harrigan stop the Alien when it can turn invisible and kill him without him knowing it.....Predator was so ahead of its time when released, and such a fool proof high concept movie, it will stand the test of time, and will always be heralded as on of the standout movies of the eighties.So a sequel was inevitable, and while its nowhere in the same league as the Arnie movie, its a lot of fun, despite many plot holes and stereotypes.I was an odd choice for Glover to play the lead, and one cannot help think that it's just Murtaugh on a really bad day, but he does the job well, and comes across as a more human hero, much like McClane in the greatest movie ever made (Die Hard).It's plenty more gruesome than the first, and there are some good set pieces, but it references the first movie heavily, from lines, to connotations, and even the soundtrack is more or less the same.It looks slick, and the editing is pretty cool, and their is plenty of good, if a little pointless support from some very good actors, its just that they are given very little to do, apart from Busey, who is Glovers little nemesis.The last fifteen. I uses is a lot of fun, and you all know by now the huge reference to AVP come the end.It's not groundbreaking stuff, and the effects are a little duff, but its still a solid action movie.",Predator 2
24,movieman_kev,just pretend this sequel never was,3,12 October 2005,"The Predator is now in the urban jungles of LA and it's up to Danny Glover to end his slaughter. Mixing unneeded humor with an undesired change of scenery leaves this film wounded before it even reaches the starting gate. Glover is NO Arnold in the least, the acting is horribly overdone, you could tell that a Predator line of toys would soon be on the way, a horrid lame story, crap special effects, all combine to make this one to miss. The only notable scene whatsoever is towards the ending that captured the imagination of fans of the Predator and Aliens franchises. But all for naught because after and impossibly long wait all the audience would get would be the highly Craptacular AVP mockery masquerading as an actual movie, which only served to make this one look good in comparison.Eye Candy: Teri Weigel gives frontal My Grade: D DVD Extras: 5 minute & 42 second 1990 promo featurette; 3 minute, 41 second Making of from 1990; and Theatrical trailer",Predator 2
25,Aaron1375,The ending saves this one.,6,26 March 2003,"For the most part this Predator highly disappoints.  What hurts it is no Arnold and no really good star to take his place.  Glover is ok, but he is just not a guy I want to see go one on one with the Predator.  He just doesn't look like he will stand a chance.  Yet, he is the main character in this one and for the most part this sequel moves a lot slower than the original.  Glover is a cop in the middle of these drug wars.  Unfortunately, the drug wars are a great target for the alien hunter, the Predator.  So it starts killing left and right and we see Glover look for evidence.  The movie finally gets good at the end as there is a great cat and mouse hunt with the Predator and Glover and Gary Busey who is part of some gov't agency who wants to get hold of the Predator alive.  This last part of the film really saves this one from being a total disappointment, but it is still a let down.",Predator 2
26,Red-Barracuda,Predator goes to L.A.,7,21 November 2010,"This sequel is set ten years on from the events in the first movie. The main difference is that the action has been relocated from the jungle into the big city. Danny Glover plays a renegade cop who patrols the violent streets, and becomes aware that something is going around and slaughtering people in a very strange and nasty way...guess what...Predator 2 is not a bad sequel really. It is, of course, markedly inferior to the original film but who could seriously expect otherwise? It does follow the earlier film's template, however, in that it mixes science-fiction, action and horror in equal measure. The addition of the L.A. setting is good. It's an L.A. of the future of course – the streets are a war zone between gangs of criminals, and the Predator steps into this violent world and makes it even worse. It's an action-packed testosterone-fuelled film with a number of tense set-pieces. It never gets boring. Overall, Predator 2 is an enjoyably violent and unsubtle movie.",Predator 2

28,thesar-2,Robocop Vs. Aliens: The Battle of the Future (1997) Begins!,2,10 July 2010,"I'll admit I've had my fill of ""guilty pleasure"" films in the past. Predator 2 was one of them. Was.What starts off with a good concept, bringing the Predator from Jungle Predator to the city, it solely falls flat. Unfortunately, two other examples fit this same mold (Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan and The Lost World: Jurassic Park) and both had the same crummy result.The difference here is, I'm a huge Jason Voorhees fan – but his (so-called) Manhattan scenes don't happen until about 10 minutes until the movie ends. Same with Jurassic Park; the dinos journey to San Diego, just in time to see the finale of the already-too-long film. I'm not so much a Predator fan, though the concept of bringing him to an industrial jungle of sorts intrigued me. On paper, it's cool, but it's the execution that's lackinganything good.And, ironically, what I hated from the first film – the lack of a solid plot, was the thing I really hated about this sequel: too much plot. We have voodoo gang members, a rogue cop, a visiting Predator, instant Global warming, the future world of crime, a secret government agency and a miniature history into the Predator's existence. This movie was all over the place and wanted to cram too much in, when it would've been just fine with the simple concept of Predator taking a wrong turn in Albuquerque and ending in L.A.Also, what gives with both a ""Robocop"" theme – probably not coincidentally, the other Sci-Fi ""Future"" Part II, Robocop 2, came out a few months before this one. Or the exact duplicate scenes stolen from Aliens? It's no wonder the Aliens would battle the Predators soon enough. Heck, even Before-He-Matured Bill Paxton was in both Aliens and Predator 2. (See a MUCH better side of Mr. Paxton in Frailty and A Simple Plan. Shoot, he was better in Twister and his The Terminator extras scene.)While I barely want to comment on the addition of Morton Downey, Jr. – God, he was a horrible personality in TV and he's not much better here, I will have to mention poor, poor Danny Glover. Sure, no one can replace Arnold Schwarzenegger – NO ONE – and I'm sure that wasn't their 100% intentions, but come on. Glover did the best he could with the role, but only played a more serious version of his Lethal Weapon character: Sergeant Roger Murtaugh. Granted, outside of the Lethal Weapon franchise, Grand Canyon and the original Saw, he hasn't been in the best movies. (No, I have yet to see The Color Purple – I can't reference to which I have not seen.)The movie takes place in the far-distant future of 1997 (7 years from when the actual movie took place) in Los Angeles. It's 109 degrees and it's crime filled with a Voodoo Cocaine Gang that holds both Lieutenant Harrigan (Glover) and the Predator's (Hall) interest. Technically, the invisible hunter Predator is helping the police, and World, as a whole, but tracking down and slaughtering the gang members, but this doesn't stop Harrigan from investigating and getting his partners killed in the process.Eventually he meets up with 1980's icon (yeah, I know this was released in 1990, but his career wasn't quite over yet) Gary Busey who plays super-secret agent out to trap and harvest the Predator for the military. Sound familiar? Anyways, along with goofy, and completely unfunny sidekick, Jerry (Paxton) they get deeper in the web of the Predator's plans for, well, hunting.The movie ends cleverly – and I won't spoil it, this is one of the movie's highlights. Okay, I'll give a clue: they'll eventually produce a similar scene in Bride of Chucky's opening scene.All the key players from the 1980's/1990's action films are here as are the clichéd scenes, but the movie has zero heart and the potential for a unique sequel was squandered. And that scene where the soldiers are about to be ambushed and Harrigan tries to get their superiors to get them out of harm's way while watching from monitorsp#ssed me off. It's one thing to mimic a movie, but to blatantly steal from the superior Aliens is just plain bad taste.",Predator 2
29,gridoon,Inferior sequel.,5,30 September 1999,"Inferior, if not uninteresting, sequel to one of Arnold's best movies. While the original began as a Rambo-type actioner and then turned into a claustrophobic thriller, this one emphasizes action, shootouts and mayhem throughout. Extremely loud film, it is not recommended for people with ""sensitive"" ears.

31,lost-in-limbo,The hunting safari has hit L.A.,6,24 March 2008,"From the get-go this sequel had big shoes to fill, and so to live up to that it ups the hysteria, violence and of course the predator's involvement. For better or worse, it just can't match the original, although it's still a highly entertaining trophy sequel. The lousy reputation it has been branded with doesn't do it any favours, because it's far from bad. Truly this is one frenetic story that shifts from the cops battling rival drug gangs (Columbians and Jamaicans), to taking on the Predator. Yep Danny Glover finds himself smack right in the middle of the nightmare, and eventually playing a cat 'n mouse game with the predator. Glover is suitably fine in the lead role, but it's the support that features largely. Bill Paxton's loose cannon cowboy-cop is fun. Maria Conchita provides bite. Rueben Blades solidly works off Glover and Gary Busey's edgy intensity always diverts as a fed. Robert Davi and Morton Downey Jr. appear in minor support. And donning the predator suit again is Kevin Peter Hall. The novelty of the creation might not be as potent, but still it's an admirable creation that Hall fitted perfectly and brought to life with personality.Music director Stephen Hopkins makes his debut, and floods the screen with relentless flashes of sweaty style, and hardcore action. Watch for the cracking climax. While keeping with the blood n' guts of the original, it demonstrates a far nastier quality (which replaces the original's break-neck tension) and this could be associated to the seedy, rundown locations of an urban jungle that's L.A. The film has that sombre, rough, ugly and dirty feel. You could say it's pretty much the same routine (or set-up), just done in a different environment. The high-octane camera-work, blends in with the rapid editing and music score is explosively arousing. It's quite excessive, and pumped up on those technical fronts, but never becomes a mess. Well not much of one. The plot moves quickly by not giving too much away and throws in some interesting references, or possibilities to where this franchise could go. Sure reading too much into it can bring out the ridiculousness, and senselessness of the exercise, but we're not expecting art here. An unjustly mangled sequel.",Predator 2
32,Robert_duder,Definitely a far cry from the original but certainly has its merits,6,5 February 2013,"Predator 2 was inevitable. You can't jump start a story with a creature like Predator and now want to explore everything there is about him and rightfully so. However, there were some serious mis-steps in the making of this sequel and casting was definitely part of it. The fact that Schwarzenegger did not return having decided (rightfully so) to do T2 was a huge misfortune for the film makers. Furthermore choosing Danny Glover as their star was simply a big mistake. I like Glover but he's a supporting/character/sidekick actor not a star that can carry the film. Taking the Predator out of the jungle was interesting but ultimately a bad decision. There was something instinctual and animalistic about Predator hunting in the jungle and it just seems awkward and forced in the city landscape. The most important thing about Predator 2 is the details they put into learning more about what and who the Predator is. We see their ship, more into their arsenal and their vision capabilities. Predator 2 feels like it leans more into the horror genre than the action and while the Predator focus is good it loses a lot of points in style, plot and action.I don't want to harp anymore on Danny Glover but his role in this was ludicrous. Schwarzenegger was so good because it was completely believe that this war bred soldier could fight with everything he had against this larger than life being from another world. Glover does the same and in fact seems to give the Predator an even bigger battle than Schwarzenegger did without pushing himself as much and that just seems ludicrous. He was the wrong choice for this film. Gary Busey is decent as the Predator obsessed Peter Keyes. He doesn't get a lot of scenes but he does well in them, just a tad cheesy at times which is typical Busey. Kevin Peter Hall returns as The Predator and he deserves mention because his massive hulking presence and his body language speaks volumes and makes you believe this being from another planet. Supporting cast including a very young Bill Paxton, Maria Conchita Alonso and Adam Baldwin in decent but small mostly insignificant roles. Paxton is fun but brief without a lot of depth to his character. I almost would have bought him as the hero before Glover.Another strike against Predator 2 was the loss of the amazing John McTiernan for Stephen Hopkins. Nothing against the guy because he's done some good TV later on and a (meaning one) decent movie, The Ghost and The Darkness but he didn't have the same level of commitment or experience needed to do this one justice. As I mentioned, its not a complete loss. There are some solid scenes, some decent action and the last scene on the spacecraft is impressive to Predator fans. I really felt like the biggest issue was Glover in the starring role. He doesn't carry the film that way it needs to be. Obviously you can't experience Predator without seeing this film but it certainly is a bit of a let down once you've watched the first one. Its a little less cheesy than the first but lacks that certain classic feel. 6.5/10",Predator 2
33,bowmanblue,Your dad versus the Predator,7,26 September 2016,"Just in case there was ever any doubt, the action sci-fi film 'Predator' was an absolute classis in its genre (okay, so it'll never win much praise in terms of deep and meaningful character arcs, but if you're looking for Arnie butting heads with an unstoppable alien then you've hit the jackpot). It was so successful that a sequel was green lit pretty soon afterwards. Most people imagined that Arnold Schwarzenegger would reprise his role without question and were left pretty surprised and disappointed when he turned it down. However, not many would have predicted that the man destined to go toe to toe with one of cinema's nastiest aliens would be Danny Glover.'Predator 2' isn't a bad film, it's just got Danny Glover in. I know that sounds pretty harsh. And, actually, I like Danny Glover. The problem is he's just woefully miscast here. He dresses like your dad and appears overweight while he shuffles around on set. It's not his acting that lets him down, it's purely his physical on screen presence. Plus the fact that he's hardly known for his 'action' roles. Yes, Lethal Weapon was sort of an action film, but he was the 'comedy side-kick' and it was part 'buddy cop' movie. He just doesn't work in the role. And that's a shame, because, as I said, Predator 2 isn't bad.It's now set on the streets of L.A. instead of the jungle, a move which limits the claustrophobic atmosphere, but I can live with that. Plus you see a lot more of the alien itself. Again, not really a problem, especially when you see how much they have upgraded his weapons. Not only to we get a chance to see the inside of a Predator's spaceship, but he's here sporting all the latest 'human hunting' technology that he predecessor couldn't seem to afford. And then there's the action itself. It's actually pretty cool. The special effects are well done and the action is exciting, all in all giving quite a ride for a 1990 movie. But we're just stuck with Danny Glover.Like I said, it's not his acting that's at fault, he just doesn't look up to the challenge. He huffs and he puffs, but her certainly doesn't blow the house down. Perhaps the only reason we root for him is because he looks so much like an underdog when fighting an unstoppable alien with tonnes of futuristic technology.If you like the Predator franchise (or rather the first film, because everything after that has been well and truly divisive!) then realise that this one doesn't come close to the original and never will. However, go into it with your expectations lowered and it's at least a fun little monster movie. Don't worry... it's still head and shoulders over those two Aliens vs Predator movies.",Predator 2
34,lesleyharris30,"A Sequel that was simply Made for Money,",4,16 August 2015,"Predator 2 is an awful movie with a poorly written storyline and a mostly mediocre cast. It's a very disappointing sequel, I had very low expectations going in to this for the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in it, but it managed to be even more of a let down than I expected, there is no thrills, even when the predator is on screen I didn't felt any bit of terror as I did with the original, and getting the creature to say stupid comedic lines didn't help. The only redeeming factor about this movie is Danny Glover in the lead role, he is a very charismatic actor and the confidence in his performance is very evident, it was nice to see him shine as a main character, even if he deserved so much better. My main issue with the movie is that it was made for no reason other than making money, the director isn't the same, the cast isn't the same, the studio just decided to throw together a sequel with a bunch of people because the first one was a success, the beautiful set pieces and the very clear hard work that went it to making the original is clearly absent here. Little horror, too much mediocre action, it's a very disappointing sequel and I couldn't possibly recommend Predator 2 to anyone. A deadly alien begins hunting the streets of Los Angeles for his prey. Best Performance: Danny Glover Worst Performance: Gary Busey",Predator 2
35,CuriosityKilledShawn,A vastly superior sequel. Absolutely brilliant.,10,5 November 1998,"'Silent, Invisible, Invincible. He's in town with a few days to kill.' Has there ever a tagline cooler than this? I'm telling you there hasn't. Long, long, long underrated Predator 2 seems to be finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves. Why all of a sudden? Because when standing next to the extremely crap AvP, it looks like pure gold to those miserable cynics who disregarded it when it first came out because Arnie was not in it. Fair enough, a Terminator, Conan or even Commando film without Arnie just wouldn't work. But the 7-foot tall, Rastafarian, otherworldly hunter is the star of this film and this time round he gets much, much more screen time. We all know what the Predator is so Stephen Hopkins shows off this ace instead of hiding it up his sleeve.The year is 1997 and the City of Angels is boiling under a 109-degree heatwave. Columbian and Jamaican drug lords have turned the streets into a war-zone. The police are out-manned and out gunned and incompetent. The last thing they need to deal with is the Predator.The titular hunter has returned with an increased arsenal of weapons and is keen on slicing and dicing the aforementioned druggies for fun. During a brutal gun-battle on the streets he watches Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover), a slightly-crazed renegade cop, blow away half a dozen Columbian scumbags and chooses him as his ultimate prey. Naturally, Harrigan and his ethnically diverse team of cops have enough problems without having to worry about their skulls ending up in the Pred's intergalactic trophy cabinet.Making matters worse is faux-DEA Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) who pretends to be after the druggies but is really more interested in swiping the Pred's advanced technology. Yeah, good luck with that! From start to finish Predator 2 is brash, unsubtle, in-your-face wall-to-wall action. A hectic, breathtaking succession of non-stop, increasingly exciting set-pieces. The final 45 minutes will you wetting yourself with excitement I kid you not. While Hopkins (fresh from his Nightmare on Elm Street 5 debut) has remained constantly employed he's never really become a star director, which is a shame since he has a slick, cartoonish style and is far more talented than most other anonymous directors. Like John McTiernan did in the first, he provokes a dusty, sweaty and overbearingly hot atmosphere in the daytime scenes and an alien, Gothic feel to night (pun intended). The way he captures LA on film just makes you NEVER want to go there.Fans of Alan Silvestri's score of the first film can take comfort in the fact that all of his cool themes are back (they were rudely ditched for AvP) and more evolved. It's probably the most engaging score he's done. His Latin drums, sinister, shrieking, Hermann-esquire strings, yawning, haunting urban sound effects and occultist voodoo chants dominate every scene and give each one its own unique voice.But it ain't just that. Everything from set-design and cinematography to sound-design and film editing is nothing short of brilliant. If you think I'm overreacting just watch the film and see for yourself. There's nothing mass-produced or conveyor-belt about Predator 2. Twentieth Century Fox chucked loads of money at it to make it the most sophisticated sequel it could be. Everyone involved seems to have made a huge effort and done their absolute best.It's sad that action films like this are not made anymore. Predator 2 is a classic, the kind of movie that feels torn straight from the pages of a 1950's pulp detective novel and crossed with a Twilight Zone episode. 10/10, no doubt.",Predator 2

37,callanvass,"I have a soft spot in my heart for this sequel. It's quite entertaining, if nothing else.",7,24 January 2011,"(Credit IMDb) LAPD lieutenant Mike Harrigan and his cocky detective partner Jerry Lambert soon realize that what seemed a bloody feud between voodoo high priest King Willie's Jamaican gangs and Ramon Vega's Colombian drug gang is actually the work of a scary third party. Peter Keyes's federal team shields the crime scene even for the LAPD. BUt after forensics proves it must be an alien, who keeps making victims, the chase brings them all together.This has been lambasted time and time again by Predator fanatics. While I can see why, I enjoyed what it tried to do. It tried to make the creature relevant in public; unfortunately the script isn't able to pull this off. What it does give us however, are exciting shootouts, some exciting suspense, great chase scenes, and I might get flamed for this, but a great, and charismatic lead in Danny Glover. Aside from the ugly outfits he wore, he really pulled his performance off beautifully. It has some great secondary characters as well. I also enjoyed the mind-games played by The Predator in the subway scene. How he just stalks the people, especially Paxton's. Its goofy nature served the movie well, and for what it was, I highly enjoyed it. The first was a master at creating tension, suspense, and balancing it all perfectly with action. This one is more the action route, but it doesn't mean it's not good. I just think people were disappointed, Arnie didn't reprise his role, the setting obviously threw them off, and they didn't like Glover's performance. The finale was a bit too neat for me though, it didn't feel that realistic. Am I really supposed to believe, they would let him off that easy, just because he was valiant and courageous in his efforts to fight them? The gun from early times was a nice touch though. No, it's not perfect, but it is underrated entertainment. Yes it's a failure, but an entertaining one. Hey, at least it's not like the Alien Vs Predator Movies! Performances. Danny Glover gets lambasted like no other for his performance here, but I thought he was fantastic. His intensity knows no bounds, and his sense of humor benefited the film the greatly. Some say, he basically brought his Lethal Weapon stuff here, but I disagree. He has traits of the Murtaugh character, yes, but he is clearly darker in his approach. He was a likable hero, and I thought he followed up Arnie very well. Gary Busey plays crazy like no other, and he was a treat to watch, when on-screen. Maria Conchita Alonso Acts with her accent, and was utterly terrible in my mind. Miscast is an understatement. Bill Paxton always plays a great sleaze-ball, here is no different. (It's my specialty!) Morton Downey Jr. is annoying, he did his job, I'll say that.Bottom line. Far from perfect, but it's certainly entertaining in my books. It has plenty of pro's that outweigh the cons in my mind. Take it for what it is. A less intelligent venture into the real world, turned into a full-blown action picture. Hopefully you'll see my point. Recommended 7/10",Predator 2
38,851222,One of my favorite sequels ever,10,28 October 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Predator 2"" (1990) is simply put, one of the best sequels ever or at least in my opinion it is. There were a lot of negative response regarding this picture when it came out. After watching this movie for 7-10 times in my life (seriously) I simply can not understand, why was this negative reaction. These are the reasons why in my opinion ""Predator 2"" is superb entertainment, based on negative stuff that I have read:1) The setting. It's a sequel, so if it would be set in jungle again, it would repeat itself. ""Predator 2"" takes place in urban setting, so it's 360° different than the first picture. The city itself is not overdone in futuristic style, it's 1997 (future at the time when movie was made) and crime chaos is on the streets of L.A.2)No Arnie. Really? Is that an issue? How realist is would be if out of nowhere, the same person would encounter the creature from outer space on second time. Yes, there are legendary examples like ""Alien"" franchise (only first two pictures), but I don't think it would have worked equally good in this franchise. The new setting – logical that it has a new lead.3)D.Glover is not an action hero. Not true! He's superbly cast here as a lead hero. In this setting, he's a cool, mortal detective who gets in very unusual situation and acts as our everyday hero. He's not Arnie, and he shouldn't be – it would be more funny if they would have cast D.Lundgren type actor as a synonym to Arnie.These are pretty much the main issues that audiences / critics have got upon it's release.Overall, ""Predator 2"" is superb entertainment, superb sequel - you can't ask for more.",Predator 2
39,Bored_Dragon,Better than first one,8,11 July 2017,"Since I started to maniacally watch movies a few years ago, I realized that widespread opinion that sequels are as a rule worse than original movies is simply a prejudice without any foundation in reality. People mostly stick to their disappointments and use them to prove this prejudice, completely overlooking the very big amount of sequels that are better than originals and a huge number of those that are at least equally good. I think that in total score, the sum of equal and better sequels overtakes the number of lousy ones big time. This one is a good example. It is hard to compare Predator and Predator 2, because, aside from Predator himself, those movies have nothing in common. They are hardly the same genre. But to me, the sequel is incomparably better. Much deeper and more developed story, with more background, better characterization, more diverse action, much better acting... I gave 8 to first one, but it was sentimental stretch and rating within the genre, cause that movie left a big mark in its time, while I rate Predator 2 unbounded to a specific genre, so the difference is essentially much bigger than just 0,5.8,5/10",Predator 2
40,The-Sarkologist,The predator comes to town,6,17 November 2018,"And here is another one of those movies that I watched umpteen number of times in my youth, though funnily when I watched it again recently a part of me felt that it just was nowhere near as good as I originally thought it was, and it certainly is nowhere near as good as the original film. Okay, maybe the effects just weren't that good back then, but the thing is that is forgiveable, even though they seemed to be pushing the boundaries with this film. Then again, they seemed to be pushing it just that little bit too far at times, and as such failing, or simply being lazy, such as the scene at the end when Danny Glover encounters all of the predators. However, I suspect that in the days of the ridiculous overuse of CGI, we tend to see through bad special effects much more than we did back in the days when this film was first released.
Where the first film was set in the jungle, this film is set in Los Angeles in the near future (based upon when it was released, not when I watched it) where crime has degerated to the point that there is open warfare in the streets. Funnily watching the huge gun fight between the Columbians and the police at the beginning of the movie made me realise that things didn't seem to turn out like that. In fact, considering how gun violence in the United States has evolved some could suggest that it has turned out a lot worse.
I guess the setting of the film is in part where it falls down. The original movie seemed to flow just so much better. The events worked, and there was some logical order with how they came together. For some reason that didn't seem to be the case in this film. For instance, the Predator just seems to randomly appear in places with no rhyme or reason. Sure, the gunfight at the start has some logic about it, but turning up at the apartment of the Columbian Drug Lord, and the whole subway scene, really didn't seem to make all that much sense. Also King Willie, why was it that he had decided, just at that point, to appear and confront him?
Yet that confusion really only appeared in the central part of the film, particularly the subway scene. However after that scene, where the Predator returns to the slaughterhouse district, this seem to start flowing in a logical order much, much better. In a way it just felt that the creators really had a bunch of disparate ideas that they simply threw together just to make a sequal. Hey, it isn't as if the film is bad, I still quite enjoy the film, and it certainly brings back a lot of memories. Oh, and you just can't beat some of the one liners that are thrown about, even in a film that doesn't have Arnie as the lead.",Predator 2

43,paulclaassen,Rather give it a skip...,3,12 May 2019,"Unfortunately - as with so many sequels - 'Predator 2' does not live up to its predecessor. The film was merely a detective crime thriller and not as atmospheric as the original film, being set in the city. Way too much comic relief as well, and completely out of place.The film suffers from way too many conveniences and plot flaws. So, Predator is now a crime fighting hero, huh? I don't understand the Predator's motives in this film. And where did he come from by the way? How is it that he happens to target the right (bad) people at the right time? How did he know to go for the bad guys in the movie? Why did he just happen to always be where Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) was?And why does he return to a crime scene?

46,eddie_baggins,No classic but a fun 90's action/horror regardless,6,1 September 2020,"Swapping the actual jungle for the futuristic concrete jungle of a 1997 Los Angeles, a sitting torn apart by gang violence and crime, Predator 2 is a very different beast to its beloved forefather but its also far more enjoyable than many gave it credit for upon a relatively cold reception on release.There's no Arnold Schwarzenegger this time around and none of the epic set pieces, one line zingers or thrills of the 1987 original but director John Hopkins managed to make one of the most 90's movies of the era as we follow Danny Glover and Bill Paxton's detectives as they get more than they bargained for when they try to take on the violent gangs plaguing their city.Filled with insane over the top violence, non-pc comedic undertones and a bunch of one dimensional characters that are merely fodder for the titular alien hunter, Predator 2 is not a nuanced cinematic offering but it doesn't try to be anything its not and in the process does a great job at trying to be a different film to its predecessor, no doubt a reason why die-hard fans of the first installment found it hard to warm to Hopkin's effort.It's also interesting that the film, in trying so hard to offer a different take on the Predator experience, hides its main asset for the majority of the films first 60 minutes, with more screen time given to the gang aspect of the tale early on as our deadlocked friend watches and observes from a far but once he takes centre stage as the police force narrow in on his hideout, Hopkins film barely lets up as it unleashes a barrage of violent confrontation's that would have genre fans smiling with glee.Taking it all in their stride is Glover and Paxton who do what they do best without ever trying to over extend themselves and they get solid support from bit players like Gary Busey, Rubén Blades, Robert Davi and Adam Baldwin, who all get very little to do but have fun while their allowed in an exercise that was quite clearly not overly interested in progressing any of its human components to more than fair game for its centerpiece act.Considering the dire quality of other Predator outings in the years that were to follow Hopkins film, bar the fun but forgettable Robert Rodriguez outing Predators, Predator 2 remains the second best offering in the series outside of the classic first event and a film that is exactly what the 90's excelled at when it came to over the top and excessive big screen spectacles.Final Say -Loud, brash, dumb and a whole lot of fun, Predator 2 is by no means a classic but its 100 or so minutes of pure over the top good times that eventually allows its main attraction to have a great time for our viewing pleasure.3 beef loving aliens out of 5",Predator 2

(And the fact that Glover is a much better actor than Arnold has quite a bit to do with this.) The movie looks gorgeous, and the effects are just as impressive as they were in the first film. Storywise, it makes just as much sense as the original- perhaps even more so: rather than tracking errant Humans through a jungle, the e-t goes straight to the source. Makes sense, huh...? The bad rap this one seems to have gotten on this site is a bit of a mystery, as it's just as good as the first one.",Predator 2
48,TheMovieDiorama,Predator 2 falls prey to its own stupidity.,4,2 January 2019,"There's a fine line between silly entertainment and stupid irritations. This sequel to the testosterone packed 'Predator' is unfortunately the latter. McTiernan's creative and focused direction has gone. Schwarzenegger's charisma has been terminated. Luscious jungles have been substituted for the dirty streets of Los Angeles. And in doing so has somehow recreated its predecessor almost exactly, yet with mundane results. Amidst the turf wars between armed Colombians and Jamaican drug cartels, an LAPD officer comes across unusual killings which soon finds him encountering the eponymous extraterrestrial. The Predator. There are no ""choppas"" to get to. Just meandering through urban alleyways and dark subways, in an attempt to survive. Many perish as the alien lays its eyes upon its prey. But only one man can stop him. One normal old-ish lieutenant that lacks the intuition and beefiness of Schwarzenegger's character. Mike Harrigan. If a Predator can decimate an entire elite special forces unit, but struggle against a generic wise-cracking officer. Well, he ought to pack up and go home. For some unknown reason, this alien conveniently follows the lieutenant and kills the cartels for sport. No idea why it's just them, I guess the plot needed it. Then towards the end, the mask comes off. Glover ironically starts to say ""you're one ugly mothe..."" until the Predator actually speaks and shouts the expletive, completing the infamous quote. How. Ridiculously. Stupid.It's not even a case of the Thomas Brothers' screenplay being clever enough to contain a commentary on drug warfare. It's just bad. Each character harnessing annoying clichés, and each actor hamming up their performances to maximum potential in an attempt to have relatable qualities. Paxton is obscenely irritating and fails as the comic relief. Glover just didn't work and felt more like ""Lethal Predator"" than a true sequel. The one liners unsuccessfully withhold any staying power, making the original even more unforgettable. Aside from the gritty opening sequence and the enjoyable final battle, there's not much content that substantiates originality. It follows the same narrative structure as its predecessor, just in a different environment and with stupid additions to the plot.

Also, this one doesnt have that macho factor like the original.This second installment of the Predator franchise takes place ten years after the events of the first film n the events of this one is set in Los Angeles where the predator, notable for hunting humans for sport throughout armed conflicts, enjoys killing gangsters, cops n drug cartels.
The entire train sequence is shot in the dark with shaky cam, flickering lights that we cant conclude whats going on.

56,Anonymous_Maxine,Nothing can be scary with such goofy looking feet.,4,3 November 2004,"What a snoozefest. In this disastrous sequel to the vastly superior Predator, we are left to wonder whether someone actually, in good conscience, thought it would be a clever idea to move the Predator into downtown LA, or whether it just took place closer to the movie studio because no one in their right mind would bankroll a film like this, so they couldn't afford any location shoots. My money's on the latter. And another thing, Predator 2 is set in the distant future (far off 1997!!), why would they do something like that? The movie came out in 1990 and then there was only seven years before we saw that downtown LA (specifically the criminals) do not look anything like they are portrayed in the movie. Look at Back to the Future II, for example. It was made almost 20 years ago, and there is still more than a decade before we will all see how wrong they were in predicting what the future would look like. At least the rest of the movie was good.The streets of LA look a lot like they did in the Robocop movies, and the criminals look like they did in Robocop 3, by leaps and bounds the worst of the series. We get all these criminals who are dressed up like circus clowns, and the movie even throws in some crime kingpins that look like caricatures of witch doctors and whatnot. Like they were flown in straight from the mountains of Nepal and asked to say a few lines for the camera. Is this supposed to create the sense of isolation and unfamiliarity that the first movie created so well? Please.Danny Glover takes on the role of Lieutenant Mike Harrigan, basically the leader on the search for the killer who keeps leaving bodies stripped naked, often with things like heads and spinal cords pulled out (not cut, but pulled) and hanging upside down, until the FBI, I think, shows up to take over the investigation. The endlessly watch-able Gary Busey steals the spotlight in every single one of his scenes, but mostly because Glover, also a massively talented actor, for some reason gives a halting and simply bad delivery of his horribly written lines. Busey's character is also pretty badly written, but he has such a recognizable presence that you almost don't notice. Ironically enough, it works to Busey's and the movie's advantage that he simply plays the same character that he almost always plays in his movies  himself. The script is so full of clichés and unrealistic conversation that it sounds like it was written in an afternoon, if that. Had the writers read these lines out loud to themselves while writing it, I assure you they would have realized how ludicrous it sounded.The movie starts with a ludicrous shootout scene between the cops and entire herds of criminals, as the two gangs, you might say, fight for control of the streets. In the pessimistic future view of the movie, much like the Robocop films, crime is out of control, and as you see here, the police are out-manned and outgunned by the drug gangs on the streets. The Predator watches over this whole shootout, always out of sight, no doubt wondering why these creatures are so intent on killing off their own kind.Here's another interesting irony of the movie, the Predator, as is to be expected, comes with all kinds of new weapons, a remodeled mask, and lots of cool gadgetry, some of it meant for self-applied medical treatment, and yet some of the things that are brought over from the original film are just botched. We learn in this movie that the Predator doesn't make himself invisible, but is somehow able to bend light. That's even more impressive than invisibility! It almost gives you the perception that the Predator carries at least some of the power of something like a black hole, but the shimmer effect is just badly done here. I would have thought that a newer movie would have been able to improve upon the one from a few years earlier.Bill Paxton, 4 years after his performance as the over-the-top and entirely too cocky Private Hudson from Aliens, turns in a performance in this movie as exactly the same guy. Overly confident despite being in completely over his head. His role here, as he explains in his interview on the DVD, is to act entirely too sure of himself, like Billy the Kid, until he realizes what he's up against, at which point he turns into the whining baby that he was in Aliens.The only thing that the movie successfully brings over from the previous film is brought over as an excuse to allow a lot more guys to get killed and to make an excuse for the weakness of this movie's plot. The original team killed off by the Predator in South America was a top secret elite team of special forces, as Peter Keyes (Busey) explains to the clueless Harrigan (Glover), which is why the police forces involved have no idea what's going on. This allows for plenty of deaths before the FBI can convince the insubordinate police force (Harrigan, as it were) to believe them that the drug gangs are not involved here, and that they really do need to back off. Seriously, guys. Let us handle this. It's top secret. Harrigan, come on, back off. You don't know what you're dealing with. You don't have the resources or the knowledge to fight this enemy. I know that your friend was killed, but you just have to let us handle this. We know how to get this guy. Come on, Harrigan. I can't tell you what it really is, just let us handle it. OK fine, you see, there was this elite team in South AmericaThe best scene is the hunt scene about three quarters of the way through movie, and it's not good that this is the best scene because it is monumentally stupid. They come up with this great plan to have a room flooded with ultra-violet light while all the men wear these heat-proof spacesuits so the Predator can't see them and on top of that, they put this special dust in the air that will adhere to the Predator's body and make him visible. Great plan, except for the massive flashlights that everyone wears on their shoulders. This is the FBI! I learned in 7th grade that almost without exception, there is NO LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT. Did the FBI not realize that these flashlights were going to generate heat? My GOD.The Predator is just as ugly as in the original, but the mask has been reduced to a cheap Halloween mask, almost as bad as the Green Goblin's mask from Spider-Man. He's got this cool boomerang weapon that seemingly can cut through anything that it comes into contact with, but he talks in this movie. I hate that. Here's this alien, and he learns English just enough to deliver a couple of one-liners at exactly the right moments. At the time of this writing I have yet to see Alien vs. Predator, but I can only hope that they don't talk to each other in it. Leave the talking to Freddy!(spoilers) The grand finale of the movie starts off with a massive hole in both the script and basic logic. Harrigan finds himself hanging from the cables beneath an elevator as it descends, and he's screaming at the people inside it to stop the elevator so it doesn't crush him. Forget the fact that elevators stop a good 6-10 feet above the ground at the bottom of their shafts, this one not only has a rough hole at the bottom, but when Harrigan lets go of the cable, he falls through it and into a massive open area. The scene could ALMOST be saved if it were the basement, but it turns out to be the Predator's cavernous lair. Right there in the basement of some building in downtown LA. And no one ever noticed. We get this lengthy fight scene between Harrigan and the Predator, after which a whole crowd of Predators shows up (why they didn't come out to help their friend is not explained or wondered about), so Harrigan accepts defeat, but it turns out that they only wanted to come collect their dead and give Harrigan a gun from the early 18th Century, raspily muttering, 'Take it.' What the hell is this??Predator 2 is such a bad film that the Predator is the hero rather than the villain. He is the center of attention and we are watching to see these clueless morons get killed by him rather than to see them use their tactical expertise to do away with this unknown enemy, as was the case in the original film. Director Stephen Hopkins has turned the movie away from the action/sci fi of the original and into a horror movie. It's just too bad he couldn't do the same with the comedy that he worked on before this movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5.The movie ends with a hint at a Part 3 (with the line 'They'll get their chance.') and I can only hope that AVP is that movie, because the last thing we need is more of this!",Predator 2
57,southdavid,Hot Mess.,4,5 March 2019,"My plan to cycle through the Predator films once more and write proper reviews leads me to sit through .... And sit through I did .... ""Predator 2"".Set in the distant future of 1997, this time the Predator's hunt takes place in downtown Los Angeles during a heatwave so intense, Danny Glover occasionally doesn't wear the jacket of the oversize woollen suit. As the police clash with the various gangs battling for control of the cities underworld, a series of deaths from all sides bring Glover into contact with the Alien creature.I'm tempted to say that time has not been kind to ""Predator 2"" but I can guess that it was probably not particularly well received at the time. Whereas the first ""Predator"" is a masterclass of efficient storytelling, the sequel is a mess of confused ideas and illogical choices. It's never entirely clear what the Predator is actually doing in the city, it feels like it should be looking for the strongest example it can find amongst the gangs and the cops (which turns out to be Glover) and then it ought to try and take his skull as a prize. Instead it kills, fairly indiscriminately, for a while claiming the skull that it wants, at which point you'd assume the safari is over and it should go home.Another factor that makes the movie almost unwatchable is the dialogue, it's terrible, which is not uncommon for an 80's action film but all of Glover's lines are mumbled whispers and all of Bill Paxton's are shouted a full volume LIKE THAT'S HIS SPECIALITY !!!!!!!!! There's not an ounce of subtly to any of the performances anywhere, though again 80's action films weren't exactly renowned for them. The CGI effects haven't aged well, but the practical ones are still pretty good.Suspend any sense of logic, of a preference for acting rather than reciting lines and there's the essence of a decent film here. Maybe more of a focus on the CIA team that know what's going on, rather than wasting time with the gang nonsense could have led to more of Sci-Fi slasher, but instead we have this confused shambles.",Predator 2

The case becomes personal, when one of his team is killed by the notorious SOB. Glover leads a real likable, of course, Paxton, as a new eager beaver cop to their group, again steals the spotlight, where the performances by these players are quite impressive, as again watching the beautifully agile predator do his stuff is breathtaking up close. I really did like Maria Conchita Alonso's performance in this too, (another ""Where is she now?"" question) Not making Glover's job any easier, is a special FBI team, led by Busey (top form) who provide the answer to Glover's dismayed and frustrated team. The one on one fight with Glover and beast, is very drawn out too, but also unveils a more deadlier surprise, where we end up with what you could say, is a unpredictable resolution, like a long third act, where at the end of the film, like Glover, we are beat, and the L.A heat really works well for this atmosphere of chaos. Quite a smart, and well made sequel, more grizzly than the first, let me tell ya. Great poster design.",Predator 2

This takes place 10 years after the first film in 1997 L.A. where it's become a war zone. When a mysterious alien (Hall) starts wiping out gang members, police Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Glover) investigates with his co-workers. After his cop friend, Danny Archuleta (Blades) becomes the next victim, Harrigan stops at nothing to find his killer and soon learns it's a predator from space that likes to hunt for sport. Busey plays Peter Keyes, a scientist who is intent on catching the alien and reveals the details to Harrigan about what he's dealing with. Alonso plays Leona Cantrell, a tough pregnant cop and Paxton plays Jerry Lambert, a hotshot cop nicknamed, ""The Lone Ranger."" Glover and Busey are great in this and it's nice to see them back together after ""Lethal Weapon."" I recommend this good, suspenseful sci-fi sequel.",Predator 2

""Predator 2"" sans Arnold Schwarzenegger, focuses only on the creature itself. Instead Danny Glover gets his shot at the sly creature. Playing the hot-headed Lt. Mike Harrigan, he's doesn't complain about being to old for this. The Predator kills anyone in his path, not only cops and crooks, armed citizens as well. I didn't realize that he had a limit in his killings. He doesn't kill pregnant women. That's subway scene is the one I'll remember well. Unlike Dutch who relies on his military skills, Harrigan went medieval on the Predator like he does on criminals. To me that's anger management. When he kills the creature more come out of hiding, and he asked ""Well, who's next?"" Then one of them gives him a gun from 1715. After he does that the Predator said he's ""BEEN THERE"". Boy, is history screwed up! Even though this is Kevin Peter Hall's final run as the Predator, he won't be forgotten. Rating 5 stars.",Predator 2
61,FiendishDramaturgy,Different style from the first ~!,8,4 September 2004,"This movie starts out with a gangland riot/war happening in LA. Okay, no problem. Then it drags a voodoo bocur into the scene and I was like, ""WTF?! This isn't PREDATOR!"" I checked the box and sure enough, it was. So I unpaused the DVD and started again.This attempt is completely different than the first in the attempt to modernize the Predator story. The characters are less solid, but more likable even though they included Bill Paxton. I don't mind Bill Paxton too much, actually. You know him. He was the whiner/fake spy in True Lies with Schwarzenegger. He played the whining punk leader that got his hand nearly ripped off in the first Terminator. He was the whining brother to Wyatt Erp in Tombstone. He also played the whiner Hudson in Aliens. And so now they want us to believe him as the ""Cowboy;"" a renegade tough guy cop. Okay. I'll buy it. But I want a refund and a Coke, okay? The Predators were done in a slick style in this attempt. I'm not going to say better, but slicker. Their gadgets were better conceived, as were their abilities, and you really felt like you got a bit more movie for the time you spent watching it.The story was solid and the performances were better than average. The first one was slow and suspenseful; a device well used in suspense type productions, as ""Predator"" was. This one moved at an even pace and wasn't slow anywhere.I'm too impatient to enjoy that suspense-building device, though. When I go see a monster movie, I want action. I need the character development, but the monsters better be aggressive at some point! But this one gives you both. You get to know the characters and to care about what happens to them, through the exchanges in virtual non-stop action sequences. This movie starts off with action and ends with action. Niiiice production. Very nice.You also see the Alien tie-in in this installment. At the end, when Danny Glover is standing inside the Predator ship, notice the Alien skull hanging on the back wall.It rates a 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",Predator 2
62,elshikh4,Predator vs. Dirty Harry !,6,27 August 2020,"Predator (1987) took place in the jungle, and in the present day of its year. So transporting the events from the jungle to the city, and - somehow - into the future, was too bold from its sequel's side. Because, as you know by heart, sequels that don't repeat their originals are scarce. And while Predator 2 (1990) managed to be bold and scarce, it couldn't be brilliant though.Casting Danny Glover as the lead was beautifully different. For one reason, he's not Arnold Schwarzenegger; the megastar of the first movie. And for another, he's a black actor; and it wasn't that common to have an Afro-American as a lead of an action sci-fi blockbuster in Hollywood at the moment (even Denzel Washington wouldn't be one unless 5 years later in ""Virtuosity""). However, Glover wasn't charismatic enough, despite the cool shades, and his character wasn't a real character in the first place; he's a flat version of Dirty Harry, yet against a serial killer ""alien"" this time!Although the script has a few creative points; like building up a potential crossover between the Predator's and the Alien's franchises, or like the strange powers of the Predator himself. However, hastiness invaded nearly everything else. For instance: The Predator is on a killing spree, without a hidden agenda or a smart reason. The lead suffers from acrophobia inexplicably. The relationship between him and his colleagues is laconic, therefore feeling sorry for their deaths is out of the question. And not the very well known matter of: How the Predators spaceship is landed in the middle of the city without anybody noticing?, No, it's originally: How the lead found himself there that simply and quickly?! Well, fabrication was less raw in other B-movies!Let alone some dullness as well: The lead is hanging out of the car in the first sequence, to an extent that makes him a very easy target for the gangs he was facing. The woman, who the Predator broke into her bathroom, sensed his existence so late, despite the fact that he pulled down her wall first. For a man who's afraid of heights, the lead dealt with that roof in such a competent way that miscarried a thrilling moment competently. When the Predator handed over a 18th century pistol to the lead at the end; it seemed like a pointless move (particularly with no later prequel to explain that, as it was intended). And the comic relief, through Bill Paxton's character, was horrible, serving as additional factor of horror instead!It's obvious how this movie is affected by Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop (1987), the near hit back then, in terms of having a dystopian futuristic city, crazy street gangs, bloody and gory action, with thin satirical voice; concerning the hungry media, and the failed authority. However, I'm the world's number 1 non-fan of RoboCop, and I deem Predator 2's affection by it is one of its worst aspects!Since my childhood, I witnessed how loading movies with sex, nudity, violence, and foul language is a must in most of Hollywood production, as maybe something desired or profitable. But now, I give up. I can't stand that at all. These elements are nothing but degeneration. And with the maximum use of them, or the minimal, they damage more than entertain. Hence, their presence in Predator 2 was nasty and annoying. Enough to recall the one-F-word-for-every-sentence compulsion!Director Stephen Hopkins, who can make dazzling action movies like Blown Away (1994) and The Ghost and the Darkness (1996), did an average job this round, knowing that he had just 2 months to shoot and edit, with no enormous budget. I liked some of the subway sequence tension, the third act chasing, and the first minute in the police station sequence as one hot and clever long shot. Nevertheless, the whole movie was another B-grade B-hubbub, and by its end you have to feel deficient and empty.The music and the cinematography were fair. You can say that again about the special effects; which could embody subtly the Predator's steps in a wet ground by merely wind and water fans. Though, the highest mark must go to the art direction. Every scene has diligently atmospheric detailing, and that's what gives this movie its creditability and specialty.Predator 2 wanted to be distinct, but the lack of efforts or money, plus submitting to close hits or the market requirements, diminished its freshness and attractiveness. Recently, it was considered a cult, but that wasn't for a late rediscovery of a long forgotten excellence in it; I think that was due to the lesser sequels that came after it, which made it look good in comparison. Anyway, for me it's like a Dirty Harry sequel, with the same ending shot of its movies by the way, yet without Clint Eastwood or actual fun.",Predator 2
63,freemantle_uk,A drop in quality,6,20 April 2020,"I did a double bill of the first and second Predator films and there is a big dip in quality between the films. The idea of simple enough: take The Predator to the urban jungle. And the action with The Predator is strong like when he takes on a group of Jamaican drug dealers, and when The Predator attacks a subway cart. It was the film that added to the mythology of the Predator universe like the creature's sense of honour, taking trophies and being coming to Earth for centuries. At least it was trying to expand the universe. But the filmmakers took the baffling decision to set the film in the near-future and it looks more like it was set in the Robocop universe and the characters aren't as memorable as the ones in the first film.",Predator 2
64,kevin_robbins,This is a slight step down from the first film but still a must see,8,26 September 2021,"Predator 2 (1990) is in my DVD collection and is available Amazon Prime. The storyline follows the return of our intergalactic trophy hunter in Los Angeles while it's in the middle of rival drug cartels running the city and the police force chasing their tale trying to bring them down. When a police sergeant emerges as the most likely to stop the Predators plans, he becomes the trophy the predator has been looking for. This movie is directed by Stephen Hopkins (A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: A Dream Child) and stars Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Gary Busey (Gingerbread Man), Rubén Blades (Once Upon a Time in Mexico), Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man) and Bill Paxton (Aliens). The storyline and execution of this is a hair down from the first one but still awesome. I loved seeing the Predator in the big city settings and his killings of the gangs were a perfect way to start the movie and establish his presence. The soundtrack is in this is very good and the kill scenes were similar to the quality of the first film. Glover seriously felt like the movie was Lieutenant Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon) versus Predator and Bill Paxton was excellent as an awkward eager beaver. Overall this is a slight step down from the first film but still a must see. I'd score this an 8/10.",Predator 2
65,dee.reid,Awesome Sequel,10,28 October 2000,"Predator 2 is awesome.  It in no way tarnishes the first Predator film.  The first Predator's victims ranged from South American guerrilla soldiers to American soldiers, now the second Predator's victims range from Columbian and Jamaican drug dealers to street gangs to federal agents.  I think the setting (1997 Los Angeles)of Predator 2 adds to the overall intensity of the film.  The Predator in the first film was old and experienced, the Predator in the second film seems a lot younger, but just as deadly.  What really separates Predator 2 from the first film is the assortment of weapons.  The weapons I think, are the highlight of Predator 2.  My favorite is the flying disc.  Anyway, Predator 2 is a far superior sequel with a great plot.  10/10 P.S. Look for the Alien skull in the Predator's trophy case.",Predator 2

A sequel that's so good & so well made it's nearly as good as Predator (1987)!!! Yes & that's saying something as Predator is a CLASSIC & i love both movies. Grew up watching the predator films from video & adore these movies they are both fantastic Sci-fi Classic's. PREDATOR 2 has a new fantastic setting, the boiling pot urban jungle of war torn Los Angeles & oh my it's a war zone. The Excellent Danny Glover is a tough LA cop called Harrigan who is in the middle of a crime wave of murder & gangs & an invisible predator,all tearing up the sweltering hot Los Angeles city streets.You can almost feel the sweaty summer heat atmosphere that's engulfed Los Angeles!!!Predator 2 is also gory as hell, brutal & action packed.The excellent Director Stephen Hopkins, who also made the underrated classic urban survival Thriller JUDGMENT NIGHT, does a truly fantastic job of creating the Predator mythology & creating such intensely exciting action sequences & such memorable characters!!!! Bill Paxton (R. I. P) is excellent, Robert Davi is great, Gary Busey is brilliant, the whole cast is superb in this incredible sequel.Even the Predator looks better here & the urban environment is such a more exciting & visually pleasing setting this time around. The gangs that are terrorising the city of angels are scary with Jamaican voodoo drug lords & Colombian gangsters & plenty of bullet riddled shootouts scenes that a gloriously violent & a Harrigan's team of tough cops trying to stop all this crazy shi# it's a brilliant movie.There's also a real Detective Noir vibe mixed into all this, a proper Detective story with Harrigan piecing together all this carnage like skinned bodies hanging up at crime scenes & mysterious weapons left at slaughter sites & lets talk about Harrigan who Danny Glover really brings to life in a mouthy, arrogant & brutal portrayal of the angry L. A Cop with a big chip on his shoulder about everything & who does not like authority at all, he's a great character.Predator 2 is BRILLIANT, the atmosphere is dark & moody & the cinematography is stunning like a gothic urban playground it looks fantastic!!! The music is outstanding again just like the first film but this has more of a voodoo jungle vibe & tone & it works perfectly,i really do love this childhood classic of mine it's EASILY a 10/10!!!!

68,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Underrated gem,10,8 April 2017,"Predator 2 is a gem of a film, and don't let anyone ever try and convince you otherwise. It's just so different and so much crazier than the first that I think people had a knee jerk 'wtf' reaction and panned it. It's tough to top the sheer bombastic overdrive of the first one, which is considered a classic, but if anything the sequel switched the nitrous dial past maximum and blasts off into the stratosphere of excessive R rated chaos, an impressive feat. It also switches settings, from the sweaty jungles of South America to the equally sweaty and opulent grime of the urban jungle, namely Los Angeles of the future, bursting at the seams with so many over the top criminals and hectic, delirious violence that by the time the Predators show up they not only fit in, but seem relatively sane compared to everyone else. Seriously, every human character in this film is a coked up tornado of cartoonish energy and brashness it's hard to keep up unless you've hoovered up a few rails yourself prior to sitting down and popping in the blu ray (the blu ray of this is wicked by the way, gorgeous transfer). So get this: Danny Glover, before he got too old for this sh*t, basically serves as a renegade SuperCop in this hellhole of a metropolis, waging all out war on loads of feral gang members and degenerates, constantly leaned on by the obligatory pain in the ass of a police commissioner (Robert Davi, god bless his republican ass) and backed up by a team of state of the art badasses, including Aliens's Bill Paxton, who gets all the best lines and delivers them with the gusto the material deserves. He's also backed by Ruben Blades and tough girl Maria Conchita Alonso, whose appearance and scenes with Paxton call to mind him and Jannette Goldstein side by side in Aliens, or is that just the fanboy in me having an aneurysm? Together they achieve 80's action movie squad goals by messily wiping out as much of the criminal faction in the city as they can, including weird Rastafarian crime lord King Willie (Calvin Lockhart, spooky as all hell), until something else comes along. Something they can't see, hear, or easily empty clips at whilst cheerfully spewing profanity. The predators have branched out, and this time there's more than one, giving their inherent tactical nature a whole new twist. So who better to take on these extraterrestrial game wardens? Glover of course, who positively froths at the mouth. You know you're overacting when Gary Busey has to keep up with you, and he does his loony best as some hush hush Fed who has been keeping tabs on the Preds for sometime, and has big notions of taking them down. It's all in good fun, with jaw dropping, spectacularly brutal set pieces, violence that would not go over well these days (the 80's didn't give a f*ck, man) and a seriously chaotic vibe humming through the whole breathless ordeal. I'd even be so bold as to say that this is the better of the two Predator films, upon getting all misty eyed and craving a rewatch after writing this. Go ahead, shame me. It's just too great of a flick to be as under appreciated as it is. Oh, and watch for a sly cameo from another otherworldly baddie late in the third act.",Predator 2

This sequel is actually more violent than the original, it moves faster but the story is thin. Although the film has some surprises, especially in the third act. Die Hard fans of the original will probably enjoy this sequel. Fans of action films or science fiction will probably see this as a guilty pleasure.

72,I_Ailurophile,Over the top action fun,8,16 May 2021,"Vicious street gang warfare, opposed by wildcard cops. An unparalleled extraterrestrial hunter, stepping into the middle of it in search of a prize trophy. Danny Glover, action hero. From the tropical jungle, 3 years before, to the concrete jungle - this is 'Predator 2.'What a cast! Danny Glover is one thing. But: Robert Davi? Gary Busey? Calvin Lockhart? And, ah, of course Bill Paxton is here, too. This is bloody, violent, wholly ridiculous - and absolute fun.Jim and John Thomas' screenplay goes all in: boneheaded dialogue, gratuitous nudity, extreme violence and gore that seems to one-up 87's 'Predator,' and more. To their credit, the cast eats it up, especially Paxton, whose newly transferred Detective Lambert is crude, unlikable, and annoying - but he embodies the role so very well.The effects, props, and set decorations seem slightly improved even over this film's predecessor of a few years prior, certainly helping to build viewers' immersion in the story. Alan Silvestri's score is fantastic, doing just as much to keep us deeply engaged.As is so often the case, it's taken me a long time to get around to watching this movie. For a long time I had some minor reservations: Changing from a jungle to an urban setting just isn't as appealing to me, like when classic Shakespearean plays are adapted and modernized to another time and place. I'd long assumed on this basis that 'Predator 2' was, to at least some extent, inherently inferior to the 1987 classic.I'm pleased to see I was quite mistaken: This is fun, exciting action flick. No one in the cast is the typical action hero like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but that untypical casting works in this feature's favor. This also reveals additional details about the yautja and their capabilities that only adds to the thrills. That I had any presuppositions about 'Predator 2' in the first place simply feels silly now.What it comes down to, ultimately, is that this is an action movie, bloody and over the top with outstanding visuals. If this is the sort of film you enjoy, then you've either already seen it, or should have it marked down on a cinematic to-do list. Regardless, 'Predator 2' is a great time, well worth seeking out.",Predator 2
73,dworldeater,Totally underrated and pretty solid sequel to the classic 1st film,8,6 August 2019,"Predator 2 is the often overlooked sequel to the sci fi/action masterwork Predator. The main argument that most people have about Predator 2 is that it is not as good as the first film. That may be a good point, but there also are not a whole lot of movies in general that can top the testosterone overload of the 1st film. As far as I am concerned Predator is untouchable, but for a follow up Predator 2 is still very good. It is also very different, taking place 10 years later in the concrete jungle of Los Angeles. The Predators decide on this as their hunting ground in the middle of gang wars, humans are easy prey. Predator 2 is a very fast paced and solid movie with a ton of great action and f/x with a great ensemble cast with Danny Glover doing a great job as the lead as a very dedicated and tough cop. The cast is rounded out with Ruben Blades, Bill Paxton and Maria Conchita Alonso. Plus CIA agents Gary Busy and Adam Baldwin. There is action galore and the movie looks great and moves quick. Predator 2 is the only sequel/spinoff that I accept and respect, all of the other sequels/reboots are beyond terrible and don't get me started on those AVP movies, all of the above are pure garbage. As long as you don't expect this to be of the quality of the1st film, Predator 2 is still great and absolutely worth watching.",Predator 2
74,Agent10,Kind of a downer,5,13 August 2002,"Sure, this sounds like a good concept, but unfortunately, Arnie never showed up. While Danny Glover was solid in his role as Harrigan, this film couldn't capture the original coolness of Predator 1. While there is a lot more action and bloodshed, this is probably one of those films that should not have been made for the sake of being made. For shame.",Predator 2
75,questl-18592,Predator 2: Concrete Jungle,7,30 September 2020,"Sequels are tough, but I think Predator 2 actually does a pretty solid job. We take the alien super hunter out of the jungle and throw him into the city, replace the commando Arnold and sub in seasoned veteran cop Glover. It's not perfect but I think it mostly works, people are solid here and the predator is always a fun character to watch. Can't say anyone needs to go out of their way for this, but there are worse things to toss on if you need some background noise.",Predator 2
76,PredragReviews,"""He's in town...with a few days to kill...""",7,2 May 2016,"Following a wildly successful film is never easy, especially one backed up with the star power of an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who apparently chose not to reprise his role as he didn't care for the script, feeling the idea of a Predator film set in a major metropolitan city was a poor one. The best thing about the Predator is that he is more detail now. He looks a lot better than he did in the first movie, and the movement is much more tribal, all praise goes to Kevin who studied African tribes so he could master being the Predator, and it really shows in this film. The Predator's weapons are fantastic. You really do get to see the Predator's arsenal in this film.Glover and director Hopkins do a good job, but the effect is kind of like going from tender, juicy steak to a hamburger. The impression I got of the species is that their whole lifestyle, be that as it may, seems to revolve around the hunt, and the more difficult the prey, most likely the greater the prestige and status. If that's the case, why do they visit the Earth, specifically to hunt humans? Let's face it, we're pretty easy targets, given their technology, weapons, and various other strengths. Sure, once in awhile they may come across a worthy opponent, like Schwarzenegger's character in the previous film, or Glover here, but in general, they mop the floor with us. However, this movie never garnered the attention that its predecessor did. This is likely due to the fact that we all wanted a Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up and got a slightly more humorous, plot-driven Predator featuring more of an everyman type of hero.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Predator 2
77,Sandcooler,Perhaps better than the first,8,15 August 2010,"There isn't really any valid reason to like this sequel better than the original. Director Stephen Hopkins isn't exactly John McTiernan, Danny Glover isn't quite Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Gary Busey isn't much of anything. Why do I like it better then? Maybe it's because this sequel has way more of an underground feel, which the original sorely lacked. Absolutely everything looks vile and sordid, which is pretty appropriate given the subject matter. This is specifically obvious in the subway scene, that part is beautifully filmed. Also, despite the fact that Danny Glover isn't exactly the action hero Ah-nuld was, I do find that the ending fight in this movie is actually more impressive. A very worthy sequel.",Predator 2
78,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Awful sequel only salvaged by a good ending,5,18 July 2015,"Were it not for a rousing, tour de force of an ending, this would get my vote as being one of the worst sequels ever made. The studio wouldn't pay Ahnuld what he wanted to come back for this second go round, so we were stuck with Danny Glover, who is all right as a supporting character, but not a lead. They also wouldn't pay John McTiernan what he wanted, so we got a director of a low budget horror film (Nightmare on Elm Street 5) McTiernan also started with a low budget horror, (Nomads) was the studio hoping for a clone of John McTiernan in Stephen Hopkins?All of the action film elements from the original are gone, so is a lot of the sci-fi angle, the suspense, and anticipation of the Predator, the well written dialogue, and mostly all which remains is an excessively gory, blood- drenched film, dealing largely with voodoo and gang violence in LA, with the Predator taking on only a supporting character role.But in the rousing final act, as Glover finally does battle with the Predator, the film really comes alive, in 30 or so minutes of chasing and fighting; the highlight of the movie. We learn a bit more about the Predator's weapons, which doesn't mar what we found out in the first film. These climactic sequences rival those in the original film, if you can endure this film's first hour.Sadly, Kevin Peter Hall died shortly after the release of this film.",Predator 2
79,brando647,The Predator Arrives in the Urban Jungle.....,6,19 January 2009,"Another Predator has arrived at Earth for a bit of sport...It's been ten years since the team of special forces was ambushed by the first Predator in the jungles of Central America. In the year 1997, Los Angeles is in the midst of an intense heat wave and a gang war between the Colombians and the Jamaicans has engulfed the streets. As if that wasn't bad enough for Lieutenant Mike Harrigan of the LAPD, these conditions have attracted the attention of an intergalactic hunter, another Predator. A Predator on the loose in Los Angeles; as much as I loved watching the original Predator go wild in the jungle, this concept seemed to be a sure-fire hit for me. Well, the reality of it wasn't so kind and the results come out a bit mediocre.I had a hard time determining what it was about this film that failed to impress me. It wasn't the storyline, as it was a decent, simple plot. The visual effects in the movie were also impressive for their time period, considering it was all done before computers made the job easier. We are also treated to a good amount of violence and gore, as we'd come to expect from the franchise. So what about the film makes it so average? I guess it would have to be the writing and the acting. There were a lot of moments that had me rolling my eyes at how clichéd or campy they were. One of the biggest contributors was Danny Glover in his role as Harrigan; every line he delivered felt as if it was ripped from some other generic ""angry cop"" movie (for a great example, check out the scene where Harrigan is getting chewed out by his superior following the initial street battle). Glover spends the entire movie running around, waving his gun, and yelling at people. Bill Paxton...ugh...the man was grating on my nerves from the moment his character was introduced. Paxton arrives as Jerry Lambert, the newest member to Harrigan's team and a renowned ""lone ranger""; his loud-mouth over-acting had me counting the minutes until the Predator would pay him a visit. Maria Conchita Alonso, Rubén Blades, and Gary Busey were the only cast who didn't annoy me in some fashion, though neither Alonso or Blades has a very large role and Busey wasn't immune to groan-inducing dialogue (i.e. the lions/tigers/bears bit).Though, I don't know if these issues are with the script, the cast, or a bit of both. Regardless, it's enough to prevent the film from being of the same caliber as the original. The effects are great and I'll always count the Predator as one of the greatest sci-fi creatures, but this sequel could've used a bit more polishing and a little less camp in it.",Predator 2
80,elliotjeory,Worthy sequel,8,10 June 2020,"Good sequel with more predator action scenes and more weapons. Danny Glover was at his best kicking alien ass and the late Bill Paxton as well as Gary Busey excel in the supporting cast.

81,fntstcplnt,Predator 2 (1990),6,4 March 2020,"Directed by Stephen Hopkins. Starring Danny Glover, Gary Busey, María Conchita Alonso, Ruben Blades, Bill Paxton, Adam Baldwin, Robert Davi, Lilyan Chauvin, Kent McCord, Morton Downey Jr. (R)About a decade after one of their kind went toe-to-toe with jungle mercenaries, the Predator alien returns to Earth, this time to the hotbed of summer heat, firepower, and bloodshed called Los Angeles for good, gruesome sport; police officer Glover, evidently not quite too old for this such-and-such, is determined to end its killing spree. Fairly mindless and unoriginal programmer (and sleazier than needed), but also appreciably aggressive, gritty and violent; those looking for trashy B-movie-in-a-shiny-package satisfaction unsullied by CGI overkill and political correctness should admire its splatter and chutzpah. Too many supporting characters are underused (or irritating), and director Hopkins can't bring the same level of testosterone or expert staging that John McTiernan did to the original, but it does manage to provide the occasional scrap of cheap thrill and gory pulp one expects out of this kind of venture.62/100",Predator 2

I find the main character charismatic and the Predator terrifying, I was captivated by the story and action, the characters. I appreciated its edgy jokes, interaction and acting and bet the movie if that was made today it would become an instant hit. The tone was completely different (more towards police drama) and perhaps that's the reason that put off many fans of the original but in no way it characterizes it as bad as this ridiculous score. It brought some surprising twists and revelations which I won't spoil for you.",Predator 2
83,MartianOctocretr5,"Action packed sequel, but clumsily done",6,31 January 2010,"Not perfect, the film resorts to some tired plot devices. However, there's enough non-stop chaos and violence for any action, horror, or sci-fi fan. It's an adequate sequel, but certainly not anything extraordinary. A few new bits of information on the Predator's origin are introduced.The basic plot: Rasta alien creature goes to New York to hunt the hunter and feed on bloody carcases. Hunters here refers to gang bangers, and gruesome crime scenes of their remains strewn about puzzle investigators, including the cop hero (Danny Glover). The cop goes on a vigilante pursuit of the creature, and their ultimate mano-a-mano encounter is handled well. Along the way, the movie fulfills its obligatory cliché requirements: dumb guy wanders alone where he doesn't belong; government interlopers dressed in black want to cover everything up; and the monster shows how tough it is by destroying the bathroom of some old lady's house.Trying to meld two conflicting themes that don't fit together is a big problem this film doesn't solve. The stark reality of vicious crime lords of the inner city and a malicious fantasy killing machine may each be formidable in their own arena, but mixed together forfeits their believability and consequently any power as antagonists. They become comical caricatures of themselves, in a world that is neither fully real nor fully imaginary. The loss of the charismatic mercenary hero from the original Predator doesn't help much, either. There are superior visuals, like the interior shot that's used in the final sequence. The film never slows down, and something new is always unfolding. Acting is decent, but the script writer gives most characters poor lines and little dimension. Why the alien doesn't exploit its advantages is unclear. And he AGAIN conveniently loses most of his most lethal weapons at just the right moment? Flagrant foul, script writer. Can the renegade cop get rid of the menace, and make the streets of New York once again safe for violent crime? The film is entertaining enough to sit through and find out, but it will help to fast-forward through some of the sillier scenes.",Predator 2
84,BrandtSponseller,Too hip for the room?,10,27 January 2005,"Series Note: Although this is a sequel, it's not strictly necessary to watch this film after the first. I almost always to prefer to watch film series in order, but as the Predator films are not constructed as chapters in a novel, there may be some advantage to watching Predator 2 first--namely that the Predator itself is explained much better in this film, so it might help viewers fill out unstated backstory for the first film.Set in a ""future"" 1997 (the film was released in 1990), we're shown a Los Angeles suffering from both a mounting heat wave and mounting anarchy. Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) is a rule-breaking, short-tempered downtown cop. He works closely with Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Leona (Maria Conchita Alonso) and recent transfer Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), all eccentrics in their own way, and all but Danny equally rule-breaking. The film begins with a Colombian drug gang engaging in a shoot-out with the cops. The police finally manage to defensively drive them into a building, but when they at last converge on the gang, it seems that somebody, or something, else has finished the job for the police. More drug gangs are attacked, and it seems as if there may be some kind of vigilante on the loose. But when a secretive government task squad, headed by Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), enters the picture and takes increasingly odd actions, it seems that something even more bizarre may be responsible (a fact also given away by the film's title, it's relationship to the Predator series, and obvious shots involving the titular character early in the film).For my tastes, Predator 2 is an example that breaks the supposed trend that ""sequels are never as good as their predecessors"". I think Predator 2 is a brilliant film, better than the first film by two points. This one is a 10 out of 10 for me.Let's get the more obvious comments out of the way first. As a horror and sci-fi leaning crime actioner, director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim and John Thomas have created a fast-paced, exciting, visceral film. This is a story set against burgeoning anarchy and chaos is a gang-filled urban environment, and Hopkins appropriately never decreases the intensity of the film--we barely pause to take a breath. While that may be exhausting to some viewers, and the rapid pacing might lead some to confusion, anyone with a taste for action films should love it, plus the genre-melding is accomplished without a hitch.The cast is quirky and excellent. Keep in mind that I have a taste for surrealism, camp, absurdism, and so on, so that makes me appreciate the acting in the film even more. I'm a big Bill Paxton fan. His performance in Predator 2 is a good example why. I also like Danny Glover a lot, and he turns in a great performance. Additionally, we have Gary Busey, one of the odder actors in Hollywood (just watch his comments on the DVD extras)--a fact that to me always pleasantly comes through in his characters, and the incomparable Morton Downey, Jr., basically playing his ""real life"" television talk show personality, is even present as a ""guerilla"" journalist.The music, special effects and every other technical aspect are also excellent.But what makes this film even better is the brilliance beneath the obvious aspects. The Predator, because of his goals, is usually unseen, hidden or camouflaged in his unique way, and most of the time he's watching others. Thus, Hopkins permeates the film with images of voyeurism, hidden views, reflections, veiled appearances, and so on. There are tens of brilliant shots through windows and/or showing our primary visuals through reflections. The heat, which not only amps up the chaotic atmosphere of the film, also enables Hopkins to make everyone sweaty throughout most of the film. The sweat creates reflections. There is the regular presence of the media covering the story, being voyeurs on the film's action. Sometimes we see things through their cameras. There are a lot of televisions and computer screens throughout the film. There is a subtle theme of voyeurism via public display of personal snapshots. We become literal voyeurs, in the sexual sense, by watching the film for one brief scene. The L.A. police become voyeurs of the task force's actions. During the subway scene, much of the action becomes hidden because of a marvelous strobe light effect. I wouldn't doubt that if we watched the film with only this aspect in mind, we would probably find it present in some way in every scene, in nearly every shot.I know this film is sometimes panned, but it would be undeserved. It may be a case of the film being too hip for the room. In any event, you shouldn't miss Predator 2.",Predator 2
85,areatw,Another average action flick,4,26 August 2017,"The first 'Predator' movie is probably one of the most overrated ever made. The sequel, 'Predator 2', is practically the same movie but set in a city instead of the jungle. One of the few things the first film had going for it was the setting, which added some much needed tension and suspense to an otherwise underwhelming film.All of that is lost in the second film and all that remains is a bunch of over-the-top action sequences. After so long, the relentless action becomes tiresome and the absence of a decent, interesting plot doesn't help either. Ultimately 'Predator 2' is just another average action flick, just like the original 'Predator' movie.",Predator 2
86,DunnDeeDaGreat,I like this movie,9,30 January 2002,Predator 2 is a decent sequel. It's know where near the first one action but Danny Glover is a likeable hero.

88,vip_ebriega,The urban jungle is his home now!,7,14 February 2007,"My Take: Actually equal to the original in most ways. A thrilling guilty pleasure all the way. I loved the original ""Predator"", but I was quite surprised to see that I liked the sequel lives up, and sometimes even outdoes it. The original drags just quite a bit, the whole commando plot. This sequel has cops against drug dealers, but doesn't wade in the subplot for too long, like the original, making it more fast-paced. Danny Glover may not be quite as effective as Arny was in the original, but he manages to get the job done well. The special-effects and Stan Winston's new Predator adds to the greatness. Although much of the gripping tension of the first film is repeated, it's still so excellent in bringing about some new thrills all its own. The film takes place in the ""future"" (1997). Drug dealers have turned the local L.A. streets in to a war zone and only the rough-and-tough L.A. cops to stop them, but can they stop the alien Predator? Well, finding out will be such a viewing treat. Stephen Hopkins may not be a director worth winning an Oscar, but he does his job well. Alan Silvestri's music has improved a little from the first film. Though it gets some bad criticism, PREDATOR 2 is an adequate follow-up to the first film, providing a more suitable hunting ground for its monster. It's entertaining in the ""it's-a-sequel"" sort of way. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Predator 2

The strength of the original was in its simplicity, with the quality of the action, effects, star power, and solid direction adding to the overall enjoyment. This has all those things, but it just isn't as memorable. And because we mostly all knew what the monster was and what it looked like before the movie even started meaning there was no surprise in the reveal, or no wonderment during the leading events.

Danny Glover may not be Schwarzenegger but he is quite good in his role as the cop. The action is well mounted and the big difference of having the Predator in a city VS the jungle makes for some very interesting atmospheric moments and what not. There's also some SEX!

There is just one thing that I like equally in both films, the light green blood, damn I wish I had blood of that colour and not that dumb red stuff.

I don't get why It did got 6.2 on IMDb I give it 10 out of 10. I love the action I love Danny Glover he is my favorite action star! From Lethal Weapon 1 & 2 he is terrific he is the action hero I wanted. Gary Busey and Danny Glover they both started in Lethal Weapon. In this movie they were great. I am a big fan of action flick Predator 2 and is not a stupid movie! I am comparing with Lethal Weapon 1. Because Danny Glover star of Lethal Weapon was the main cast and hero. Gary Busey from Lethal weapon was FBI agent and Glover's nemesis like was Gibson's nemesis in Lethal Weapon. The movie has great action tough the plot wasn't great but was 90's action and I love it. It is my childhood movie and the last good Predator film and worthy sequel of all time. I don't like Predators (2010) and I think Predators it is a rip off the first film. When people criticizing movies I love them because I am a big fan of Predator 1 & 2 so I really don't care. Arnold Schwarzenegger turn down the offer to reprise his role from the first movie he said the story set in the city would be bad idea and maybe it was. The new Predator the actor form the first movie had new technological weapons than in the first one. I love Predator 2 no matter what everyone say's I love my childhood movies and I enjoyed the score too and the movie it is not bad as people are saying, it is underrated I love it.There are many elements that I enjoyed in the film. The score, the action scenes and Danny Glover. The predator was there as a test of rites or passage which is pretty clear by the end with the elders showing up to collect his body. I think this film is highly underrated and no where near as bad as some say about it.Why I love this film as much, that I love the original film?: because of action, it is sequel to the first movie, Kevin Peter Hall stars in this movie actor from the first movie , it has Predator movie theme score, more Predators showed up at the end. Glover gets a gun from 1717 sorry if I did not wrote correctly. I always love Predator 1 & 2 movies no matter what, if it was terrible or not.Some people are saying similar things about Predators but I am not listening them, I love them and I am listening to my self. Predator 2 does have error hole the story shouldn't be set 10.years after first movie in 1997 Los Angeles because the movie was released in 1990"" so it should be set in that year. Kevin Peter Hall returns as Predator. When Gary Busey say's The Lions, The Tigers, The Bears, o may your the Lion and this is the Jungle. Predator 2 the story is set in Urban jungle and is different than the first one. You are 100% right predator 2 doesn't copy predator 1 it has his own story. Predators did copy the first movie. Oh and AVPR Requiem they stole the line from Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator! I think both movies are great. I love both of them. I only liked Predators because the story was set in an amazon Jungle and it relaxed me. Predators does have a lot of mistakes and I hate it. Lauernce Fishburne from The Matrix and CSI with who was he talking? when he set the fire for Brody and his friends ugh. The rest of the Predators film I don't like. Predator 2 is the best one! It is better than Predators! I love Predator 2. Danny Glover and Gary Busey are the main cast and they completely rock. Predator 2 is the best action movie ever. More sci-fi and action more facts about Predator, they are more Predators.They are cops and FBI agents best action movie in 90s i love you Danny Glover killed him at the end of the movie Arnold did not killed him he only wounded him, Predator activated self distraction advise and he blows him self up,so Arnold did not killed him. A lot of people does not get this movie. So if you hate this movie than don't watch Predator 2,go and watch Smurfs instead stupid morons!Predator I and II are excellent films. Part III was outrageous and out of question. It has since become a cult film among fans.Amidst a territorial gang war, a sophisticated alien hunter stalks the citizens of Los Angeles and the only man between him and his prey is veteran L.A.P.D. officer, Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.This electrifying action sequel unleashes the deadly invisible Predator in another jungle -- the urban jungle of Los Angeles. Danny Glover stars as a lieutenant who mistakenly concludes that mangled bodies found by the police are the work of feuding gangs. Instead, he finds himself confronting a savage alien who has come from a distant world to hunt humans for sport.

94,The_Movie_Cat,"""Make thense, man!""",3,15 August 2010,"The Predator movies really are one of the worst examples of the Hollywood machine. US-centric movies where foreign characters are one dimensional stereotypes serving as cannon fodder only. Just look at the recent second sequel (or fourth, if you count those ""Aliens vs"" entries) where it's clear all along - spoiler ahead - that the two characters surviving till the end will be the Caucasian male and female leads.In fairness, such a description does not quite describe Predator 2. While there are some appalling ""Jamaican"" accents on show, some gun toting Columbians and a shockingly gratuitous example of female nudity, the lead here is a mid-40s Danny Glover. While it's never quite made clear why the Predator doesn't kill Glover's cop in any of the many chances he gets (other than the fact that it'd make for a far shorter movie) it is kind of nice that a lisping black man gets to be the lead in a mindless action movie.Also, in fairness, the characterisation of the white American characters doesn't fare much better... a group of one-dimensional cut outs who talk constantly about their ""ass"" and everyone is a maverick who bucks the system. You've seen that kind of movie before, right? It's a film where a female cop responds to cheesy flirting by squeezing a man's testicles and where the Predator's first words are ""MF"". It's just that kind of movie.Co-written by John Thomas(!) it's a feature that gives no respect to its audience, feeding them inane clichés and patronisingly weak dialogue in order to bolster the runtime. All of the Predator films are weak on plot or genuine motivations, noisy, bloated excesses where the only thing rewarded is the stupidity of the audience.",Predator 2
95,Vivekmaru45,Good special effects does not mean being a good film.,6,17 October 2010,"The first one Predator(1987) was a masterpiece. This sequel is below the standard that the 1987 film set. The direction is good but not extraordinary. The director Stephen Hopkins (A Nightmare On Elm Street 5, The Ghost And The Darkness, Blown Away) handles his crew well and does the most with the script and budget allotted to the film.Now here's the problem. The HORRIBLE CASTING. I was offended. No ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER??? And who the hell was DANNY GLOVER in 1990? Nothing. This film propelled him to stardom because he stole the role of Arnold. This film is not meant to be a comedy so why cast Bill Paxton??? Also not to mention that Gary Busey(Hider In The House) looks awkward.The rest of the bunch of nitwit supporting cast don't deserve mention except the minute role played by Robert Davi. Poor guy had only a few lines to say in the film.Now the special effects. This is what SAVED THE FILM FROM FLOPDOM. We seen the new weapons wielded by the predator a net is used and a spear and lastly a sort of discus which returns after killing its intended target. Also multiple points of view of the predator is seen. Taking of trophies is the same as with the first film.The plot: Los Angeles: a turf war between heavily-armed Colombian and Jamaican drug cartels. A Predator observes a shootout between the police and Colombians, watching as Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drives the Colombians back into their hideout. Before the police can pursue them, the Predator crashes through a skylight and kills the Colombians using its advanced weaponry. Harrigan and his detectives Leona Cantrell (María Conchita Alonso) and Danny Archuleta (Rubén Blades) enter the building against orders and find the Colombians slaughtered. Harrigan pursues their leader to the roof and shoots him, catching a glimpse of the camouflaged Predator's silhouette but dismissing it as an effect of the heat. Harrigan is rebuked by his superiors for defying orders and is introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), leader of a federal task force purportedly investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), the newest member of Harrigan's team.The Predator next kills several Jamaican cartel members who are in the act of murdering the Colombian drug lord. Despite being ordered to wait for Keyes, Harrigan and his team enter the penthouse apartment where they find the Jamaicans' skinned corpses suspended from the rafters. Keyes expels Harrigan's team from the scene, but Danny returns later to investigate further. He retrieves one of the Predator's speartip weapons from an air conditioning vent, but is killed by the Predator. Harrigan vows to bring down Danny's killer, believing that the perpetrator is an assassin involved in the drug war. A forensic scientist determines that the speartip weapon does not correspond to any element on the periodic table. Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie (Calvin Lockhart), a voodoo practitioner who tells him that the killer is supernatural in nature. After Harrigan leaves, the Predator kills King Willie.Cantrell and Lambert are intervening in a mugging on the subway when the Predator attacks them. Cantrell herds the passengers to safety while Lambert faces off against the Predator and is killed. The Predator is about to kill Cantrell as well, but releases her when its thermal vision reveals that she is pregnant. Harrigan pursues the Predator but is accosted by Keyes, who reveals that the killer is an extraterrestrial hunter that sees in infrared, uses active camouflage, and has been hunting humans for sport around the world. Keyes and his team have set a trap for it in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits and cryogenic weapons in an attempt to capture it for study. However, the Predator sees through the trap by using its mask to scan through various electromagnetic wavelengths and kills the team. Harrigan intervenes, shooting the Predator several times and removing its mask.Still alive, the Predator kills Keyes using a bladed throwing disc and escapes to the roof. Harrigan knocks it over the side and finds himself on a narrow ledge with the Predator hanging below. The Predator attempts to activate the self-destruct device on its forearm, but Harrigan uses the throwing disc to sever its forearm and destroy the device. The Predator falls through an apartment window and uses a medical kit to treat its wounds, then flees through the building. Harrigan follows it down an elevator shaft and finds its spacecraft in an underground chamber. Inside the ship the two face off in a final duel, with Harrigan finally killing the Predator by impaling it in the chest with its own throwing disc. A number of other Predators appear, collecting their dead comrade and presenting Harrigan with an antique flintlock pistol labeled ""Raphael Adolini 1715"". Harrigan escapes the ship as it takes off and reaches the surface just as the remainder of Keyes' team arrives, furious that they were unable to capture the alien. Contemplating the pistol, Harrigan speculates that the creatures will eventually return.Overall 6/10. Add to your DVD Collection because of the Special Effects.",Predator 2
96,Maziun,Bad sequel – a rather dull slasher with Predator in it,4,25 July 2013,"Predator 2"" is a strange kind of sequel. It doesn't have any of the characters from the first movie in it. It's a different film that ties it's action in with previous events. The director John McTiernan and original star Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down the project . Instead we have a relatively unknown director Stephen Hopkins and a star cast – Danny Glover , Gary Busey , Bill Paxton and Robert Davi. The plot is basically the same (alien versus armed people) , only the setting is different.""Predator 2"" is a disappointing sequel. The original film had good and original concept , great direction and an action star in main role. This movie has none of that. First problem – the setting. The concept of predator made sense in jungle . The jungle playground has this time been replaced by a large city (asphalt and concrete jungle , get it ?). This is a VERY bad move, it takes what was so fresh and puts the audience into too well-known territory of slasher movies.Second problem – the cast . Danny Glover is the main star in ""Predator 2"". Here , Glover gets to play the part of Riggs instead of Murtagh and it's a very odd choice. He gives a decent performance , the best in the movie and has a certain charisma. Still , Glover as the man who could defeat Predator is simply unconvincing. I understand that movie makers wanted someone more like a regular guy this time for audience to root for , but Glover is not tough enough for action star (who was the real star of ""Lethal weapon"" – he or Gibson ?). I would suggest casting Sylvester Stallone , who can be convincing as both tough guy and regular guy at the same time , but that's me.Glover is pretty much alone in this .Schwarzenegger had great support from Carl Weaters , Bill Duke , Shane Black , Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham . Here Glover gets annoying Maria Conchita Alonso plus Bill Paxton and boring Ruben Blades. Robert Davi appears for less than 5 minutes . Their characters aren't interesting or particularly well played. Only Gary Busey is quite nice as the FBI agent.Third problem – the story. Predator is just randomly killing people, without really toying with them or any real effort into it. The Predator is barely in the film, as there are huge sections where the Predator is absent, focusing instead on it's boring story. The story is utterly predictable , characters have rather lame dialogues and all in all the story is an excuse for blood splatter with lame characters that die very graphically in many different ways. The movie also seems to try a little bit of satire on future Los Angeles (something in Verhoeven style) , but it ends rather laughably over the top.Fourth problem – the direction. Hopkins tries to create some horror atmosphere in here , but fails . Even worse are the action scenes that feel very amateurish and are devoted of any spark. ""Predator 2"" has a rather slow pace, fits into the horror more than action and unfortunately unfortunately, is a lot less effective in doing so. It can't settle on one mood , it tries to be both horror and action , but neither is done right. Hopkins is more interested in visual style , and while ""Predator 2"" looks pretty cool is almost completely devoted of any real tension or excitement.The good things ? The movie looks cool. The use of Jamaican gangs seems like a original and cool idea.The music by Alan Silvestri is still good. The gadgets are cool (weapons and the ship). The movie does become fun in third act when FINALLY we get some tension and excitement. There's even some nice humor (""I don't think he gives a s**t"" , ""alright , who's next""). I also liked the Easter eggs (the head and the gun).It's true that ""Predator"" was a hard act to follow. However , there was no real need for the sequel to be made. If you can't do something right, don't do it at all. This is obviously MUCH better than those horrible ""Alien versus Predator movies"" ,but still a disappointment. I give it 4/10.",Predator 2
97,Libretio,"Pumped-up sequel, dumb but watchable",4,14 January 2005,"PREDATOR 2 Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo SR(35mm and 70mm release prints)Given that the original PREDATOR (1987) was little more than a routine potboiler, expectations could hardly have been lower for this pumped-up sequel, in which the eponymous alien beastie - a super-intelligent being, able to render itself invisible, amongst other things - arrives in LA of the near-future (1997) during an outbreak of gang warfare which maverick cop Danny Glover is struggling to contain within his jurisdiction. When various gang members fall victim to the aforementioned predator, an ultra-secret government agency (led by no-nonsense Gary Busey) wrests control of the case from Glover, who becomes personally involved when his partner (Ruben Blades) is torn to pieces by the alien fiend.Glover is a little too old for the kind of macho heroics displayed here, though his commercial profile was on a high at the time, due to his appearance in the hugely successful ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and his professional approach to the less-than-stellar screenplay is mirrored by an equally talented supporting cast, including Maria Conchita Alonso, Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin, Calvin Lockhart and a young-looking Bill Paxton as the rookie cop who has a memorable encounter with the title creature on a fast-moving subway train, the movie's pièce de résistance. As the monster, Kevin Peter Hall suffers manfully beneath Stan Winston's extraordinary makeup design, and Morton Downey Jr. (gag!) cameos as a sensation-seeking news reporter. Stephen Hopkins (THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PETER SELLERS) directs the material with a glorious disregard for subtlety or logic, and while the results may be too loud and obnoxious for some, it's fast-moving and completely unpretentious, despite levels of violence which probably pushed the boundaries of the R-rating in 1990. Followed by AVP: ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (2004).",Predator 2
98,kuarinofu,Much worse than I remember it,6,2 November 2019,"I remember loving the original Predator as a kid. I saw it first in the 90ties since I was only 1 y.o. when it came out originally and there was no way I could've fully experience it in a movie theater anyway since we still had USSR in my country back then (Ukraine).I saw it many times after that and each subsequent viewing only made it better. It was back then and still is one of the best action sci-fi movies of all time mostly because of good direction, action, nice casting and acting, great memorable lines, ARNIE, and some entertaining 80ties cliches.With Predator 2, I only saw it once or twice when I was younger and I thought it was just ok. Wasn't really interested in re-watching it up until The Predator came out. Along came the disappointment.Predator 2 is not as abominable as The Predator (2018), but after just re-watching it I felt somewhat disappointed. It's not as good as I remember it to be. And don't get me wrong, the setting is great, Predator in a big city, awesome! The expansion of the Predator lore, the production overall was great, I loved all the new toys and I remembered playing AvP and AvP2 PC games which I'm sure were inspired by Predator 2 (since the original had much less details on that).Yet besides the above-mentioned, everything else I just can't tolerate. This film really feels like a product of it's time. It doesn't feel like somebody's vision. It's a generic set of 90ties cliches but completely directionless. It's a ""whatever works"" film. No direction at all, sloppy writing that doesn't make sense, inappropriate casting, out-of-place bad comedy scenes, crazy overacting, voice-over narration and tons of expository dialogue. I don't want to start picking on individual scenes because there's just too much to pick on.It makes me a little sad that a Predator in a big city idea was handled so poorly. They had the ideas though, a Predator in the middle of a drug gang war is great. They had the visuals as well, some great scenes over the city, in the subway and more.But the final product is just a directionless mess of good and bad scenes. This Predator doesn't feel like a threat. They borrow too much from other films like Cameron's Aliens and I overall I think this film suffered greatly because of the early 90ties trends in Hollywood.Predator 2 is not the worst film in the franchise though. Original Predator is obviously out of the question, Predators was also a great film of it's own, then Predator 2 and the latest being the worst of them all.",Predator 2
99,vostf,Just bad,2,1 December 2008,"Of all the possibilities for a sequel they made all the easy and bad choices. Simply put, a predator in LA is just boring. It slaughters people then disappears, but not altogether, and back and forth. Plus the more you see it (when it's time for a heads-up), the more it looks like a man in a suit (a well-known problem in horror flicks since Cat People or The Creature from the Black Lagoon).The story is a big mess, characters are thrown in the middle, every one of them just fodder for bloody action. Danny Glover is artificially locked in the role of a naive brutal cop, an odd characterization for the man in charge here (maybe they wanted to add some kind of Lethal Weapon subtlety). The ""creative"" team put 90% of its energy in fleshing up the Big Alien Hunter, and finding reason to have it run away until the final showdown which, in turn, is overlong (tough to kill your ugly darling, uh?).The first Predator had the benefit of creating the unknown menace in hostile jungle. The big team of over-armed hunters gradually became the game. With the expectations for the first installment this didn't make sense to build the narrative away from a team of experts trying to come to grips with that elusive phenomenon. Or it would have made more sense to go for a musical staged by John Woo: John Doe Meets Predator.",Predator 2
100,DonFishies,Lacks the fun of the original,4,24 May 2006,"Predator 2 is a disappointing sequel. Plain and simple.The original film was fueled purely by testosterone, but it had a good concept (an alien hunting for sport), and was executed pretty beautifully. The action never slowed down for a break, and it was clearly, one of the best action films of the 1980's. Plus, it had Schwarzenneger. And it was in the jungle, where the concept of the ""predator"" actually made sense.Whereas in the sequel, he is in futuristic gang/war-ridden Los Angeles (why did it always have to be LA, were there never any other cities that were thought of to become infested with violence years later?). He is still hunting, but as opposed to buffed up marines, he's taking out gang members and city cops.Danny Glover stars in the film as Liutenant Mike Harrigan, who replaces Schwarzenneger's Dutch, as the main protagonist of the film. He is attempting to fight against the gangs, but once this mysterious ""killer"" appears on the scene, he attempts to bring him to justice. Of course, he has opposition from a federal agent (Gary Busey), and most of his department, but he still attempts to put the pieces together anyway.I'm not sure if it's just me, but Predator against Danny Glover just really does not sound anywhere near as fun as Predator versus Arnold Schwarzenneger. It seems like they took anything that vaguely made the original film enjoyable, and tried to tone it down a lot. Main adversary went from a pumped up Austrian, to a skinny African-American. The vast jungle went to a big city. It just does not have the same feel, look or enjoyment at all. In fact, it all seems downright ludicrous and silly.Subplots come and go, only vaguely mentioning the original within them. Others are just mentioned, and never gone back to. Supporting characters come and go, never really having a chance to shine (I'm thinking Bill Paxton and Adam Baldwin here, but there were many others who just seemed to have all the fifteen minutes or less of dialogue to use within the film). They attempt to throw in some satire with the whole gang situation, and with the news reports that are oft shown within the film, but the only ones getting the jokes are the filmmakers. And the entire gang element just comes off entirely as over the top. Voodoo rituals? I'm sure they could have found something much more original than that. In fact, removing all of that garbage would have alleviated the running time, which just seems to cry that it is too long for it's own good.As for Predator himself, the effects to bring him to life are just as good as they were before. Sure, in many scenes his camouflage suit looks really terrible, but in others it looks great. When he's not wearing the mask, you can noticeably tell how much more advanced the technology was when the second film came, as opposed to the original. He looks that much different.The film as a sequel just does not work. There's nothing in it that made the original so enjoyable in the first place, which is the cardinal mistake that always seals the fate of a sequel. If this was the original film, then we never would have gotten another one. Now if only they left out the alien skull. Then we never would have had the even worse Alien vs. Predator.4/10.",Predator 2
101,gigan-92,I'm Whole Heartedly Surprised,6,8 November 2010,"This is one of the movies in a long list of movies that I had sincerely hoped would have turned out better. Am I too rough on it? No, I was merciful to be honest. I could rate it lower, but that'd be delving into AVP territory, which not even this film dares to go. But it goes God awful close. The story was all right but needed an awful lot of re working. The characters in ""Predator"" were interesting, likable, and had bad ass lines so it was in turn sad and painful to watch them die. As much as I wanted to care about the characters here, I just didn't it. The cast had potential, come on, Danny Glover and Bill Paxton. The atmosphere set up right from the beginning is not a terrifying and somewhat subtle one, as in the last film, but an overly loud, drug, sex, gang and voodoo ( wtf?) filled sloppy mess. It was like watching the film ""Do the Right Thing"" (which is a good film by the way) on crack and with a predator thrown in the mix. In all fairness, the climax was somewhat cool and I enjoyed it but it just wasn't that involving. What a shame.",Predator 2
102,0w0,Schwarzenegger was smart enough to avoid this dumpster fire,3,2 March 2021,"I haven't watched such a terrible movie in a long time. I was actually expecting it to be AT LEAST as good as Predator (1987), but it seems that Schwarzenegger was the smartest man in the room at the script meeting because he was smart enough to not attach his name to this terrible film in ANY way.NONE of the movie makes any sense. It's almost like the movie was directed by a director who had EXCLUSIVELY done comedy movies their whole life, and now they decided ""Eh, what the hell? I can direct this action film too!""... No, Mr. Comedy Director... No you can't.It's painful to watch, especially if you just watched Predator (1987) or any of the other AVP films. Predator 2 (1990) is by far the worst AVP film in the entire franchise. I highly recommend that you steer clear of this film and just skip it completely when doing a watch-a-thon of the AVP movies. 3/10.",Predator 2

Again, this predator was amazing. We definitely see more of the predator in this one. What I enjoyed the most about Predator 2 was that the setting takes place in a city called Los Angeles or LA, which is a lot different compared to the original. That was a good thing because not only it's different, but makes the movie more interesting to watch, otherwise it would've been a carbon copy of the first one. Also, the cast of this movie was brilliant. I would say the cast is better than the original. You have actors such as Danny Glover and Gary Busey, who also starred in the movie, Lethal Weapon. Danny Glover was outstanding in this movie. What Arnold was in the first movie, Danny was in this second instalment. Danny Glover carried this movie all the way. It's really difficult to choose who was the better one though I liked them both equally. If you enjoyed Predator, you would enjoy Predator 2. You should at least give this movie a chance.

106,dr_foreman,one ugly movie,2,8 September 2004,"""Predator 2"" is a nasty little film. It's foul-mouthed, racist, and tedious, and it even features a bit of pointless (and decidedly non-stimulating) nudity. It's a real 1980s holdout, with flat action scenes that are too one-sided and blandly shot to be exciting (first, the gang members are totally whaling on the cops; then Glover arrives, and the cops are totally whaling on the gang. Yawn.)One commentator has pointed out that, since the main character is an African-American police officer with two Hispanic partners, the movie can't be racist. Sorry, but even that doesn't offset the stereotypes on parade here. Basically, the film equates minorities with urban hell. And let's not forget the silly voodoo business - that religion never gets proper respect, does it?Scene after scene falls utterly flat. Glover (an awful actor if there ever was one) argues with his superiors constantly, but we never really know why (they don't obstruct him, as far as I can tell). In fact, he ultimately comes across as unreasonable himself, prone to exploding into silly cursing rages about nothing much.The Predator itself is okay, though hardly the most inspired of aliens. It learns a bit of English as the film goes on, but only so it can match the tedious human cast curse-for-curse.I did enjoy a few segments, almost despite myself; the subway scene is exciting, though I can't figure out why the Predator seems immune to Bill Paxton's bullets (later on, Glover doesn't have any problems filling it with holes!)On the whole, though, this is an utter tanker. I'll repeat my usual complaint and shut up - the Alien and Predator franchises probably shouldn't be merged again because the Aliens have about ten million times the class. Even the weakest Alien movie is leagues ahead of this dribble.",Predator 2
107,LebowskiT1000,I LOVE this movie!!!,10,2 February 2002,"I just watched this movie again tonight for the first time in a long time, and I have to say that this movie is GREAT!!!  I know I'm going to get hurt for saying this, but I actually think I like Predator 2 just as much, if not more than the original Predator.  I'm not sure, but I kind of think that I saw Predator 2 first, which may be the reason, but I think the true reasons are the following:I loved that the Predator has more weapons, and the action sequences were more interesting.In this film they do a much better job developing and explaining the Predator.  This isn't just a crazy beast that kills things left and right. This is an intelligent being that is looking for a good hunt.  I love that the Predator doesn't attack anyone that he doesn't consider a threat or isn't a challenge.  I LOVE that he has compassion and respect for an expectant mother.I have to say there are only 2 or 3 little things that I didn't like about the movie, but they aren't anything I can't deal with.  I wasn't too fond of the Predator being struck by lightning...sure, it looks cool, but don't you think that would hurt him pretty bad?All in all, I genuinely LOVED this movie!  I don't know what is is about this movie that just doesn't sit well with a lot of the reviewers on this site, but I loved it.

111,Cinemaniac1984,I had a great time watching Predator 2. Certainly an underrated sequel with nonstop blockbusting bloodthirsty fun.,7,1 October 2021,"Predator 2 was always going to be a hard act to follow as a sequel to the blockbusting megahit Predator (1987). This time Predator 2 has a new cast, new setting, and an advanced and deadlier Predator. It's still a highly entertaining movie and I still have a soft spot for Predator 2.The movie takes place in a wartorn Los Angeles 1997 where the city is plagued by a heatwave and a gang war between Colombian and Jamaican gangs in which the LAPD is fighting a losing war. LAPD Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) leads a small group of fellow cops including Detectives Archuelta (Ruben Blades), Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonzo) and the newly transferred Lambert (Bill Paxton). Things get more complicated when gang members start to become brutally slaughtered at the hands of the Predator (Kevin Peter Hall) who is also in possession of advanced weaponry compared to the first Predator that landed in the South American jungles 10 years prior. Special Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) has a hidden agenda as he warns the LAPD to stay away from the investigation. Lieutenant Harrigan, not one to back down, defies orders and is more determined to find who is responsible for the brutal slayings that are occurring around Los Angeles.The new cast in Predator 2 was excellent. Danny Glover is a legend as Lieutenant Mike Harrigan who is more than willing to bend the rules and defy authority to bring to an end the gang war and take down the Predator. Ruben Blades, Maria Conchita Alonzo and the late Bill Paxton are terrific as the fellow cops caught up in the battle. Gary Busey as Special Agent Peter Keyes was great and is in a more straightlaced role instead of the crazed and unstable characters he is famous for.Director Stephen Hopkins who previously directed the horror movie A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child (1989) has a great time turning the ultraviolence up with a combination of science fiction action with a touch of horror with gunfights, explosions, gruesome carnage and all out action. He had mixed success with movies such as Blown Away (1994), The Ghost and The Darkness (1996) and Lost In Space (1998). He did have better success a director for TV shows such as 24 and House of Lies.Predator 2, though not on par on the original 1987 classic, is certainly way better than the other sequels and spin offs that have failed to meet the hype. It has come under scrutiny by the classification boards in the USA, UK and Australia for its violent content. Predator 2 is definitely shameless fun with a great cast.

This is sloppy, clunky, predictable, moronic, with clichéd dialog and cheesy acting and effects.There are indeed moments of intense action and suspense but it all falls apart when the actors speak the dialog that has been given to them. All of the money and interest went into the special effects and action and none into the script or dialog.Also, not much of it makes sense. Los Angeles is huge. I know because I live here but wow! The alien just happens to always be where the police are. Just around the corner, over the top of the building, on top of the subway train.

Other players included stars, Bill Paxton, Gary Busey, Adam Baldwin and Morton Downey Jr, each mixing together as rude co-characters defusing Glover's progress to catch the predator. The story is pretty ridiculous, violent in nature creating an entertaining but senseless plot. The film however does get slow at times, forming some major pacing issues.

When his team members and others continue to be slaughtered, he catches a glimpse of the killer- The Predator who can become invisible at the touch of a button, and wipe out anyone with ease. Gary Busey and his team including Robert Davi attempt to catch the Predator but fail, and it has set its sights on Glover as its next victim. A final encounter approaches, but it may not take place on Harrigan's terms.Predator 2 is a letdown after the first film was so good. The action, tension and excitement here is toned down and inferior, but luckily it is still above average. We lose Arnie, but Glover does well as the cop with a fighting spirit. The supporting cast is good, Alonso is feisty, Paxton is as good as always but not given as much to do as I would have liked, Busey is his usual scary self, as is Davi, and Blades is OK. However, the sense of teamwork that should have been present, that was a strong part of the original, is gone. There are many good visual effects here, improving in some ways on the original, and the Predator has a few new and interesting weapons at his disposal. It just lacks the spark of the original though, and does not create much excitement. The dialogue is not as good, but average action stuff, and the direction is solid but does not have the style and grasp of technique that McTiernen has. A good action, sci-fi with plenty of violence and fun, but a poor sequel which good have been better.7 out of 10",Predator 2
118,akshatmahajan,Unnecessary and boring,3,15 September 2020,"Predator 2 was an awful sequel which was not even needed. It's a very disappointing sequel. It had poorly written storyline and bad cast. For first one hour, this film didn't seem like a horro movie but a gang action movie. There is no thrills, even when the predator is on screen I didn't felt any bit of terror.The performance of Danny Glover as the lead character is also not good (almost bad). This movie should not hav existed. It spoilled all the fun of the original. I am glad they came with Predators (2010) and improved their mistakes.Overall, this is possibly one of the worst sequels I have ever watched and would not recommend it to anyone.",Predator 2
119,theshadow908,Good sequel.,7,17 January 2006,"Predator 2 takes place 10 years after the first Predator movie. Another Predator, attracted by the heat being given off by Los Angeles in the grip of the biggest heat wave in years, comes down and starts killing people in the city. When the Predator kills gang members, an L.A. detective begins to investigate.Though this sequel isn't as good as the first Predator, it still provides good entertainment and good performances from Danny Glover and Gary Busey. The Predator has a lot more mystery added too it, and the new weapons are awesome. The movie has good pacing and a lot of good action scenes. The only problem is that it's just not as fun a time as the first movie was. Some of the more intense action sequences didn't really come through again in this movie.If you're a fan of the first film, you should really see this, but just know it's not as good.",Predator 2
120,fciocca,Really bad sequel. Who wrote such an awful script?,3,8 May 2021,"The second installment on the Predator franchise is extremely bad. Usually sequels tend to be not as good as the original movie, but you need to put a lot of effort to make something so awful. The cast was a disaster, especially if compared to the first film. Where do they found such actors? They clearly don't know how to do their job. I have found really annoying especially Bill Paxton and Danny Glover. It was really painful to see their performances.The story is rushed, there is no buildup, no tension at all, and a lot of narrative elements are just copied straight from the first movie, therefore is very repetitive and there is basically nothing new. The final confrontation between Mike and the Predator is just lame, nothing to do with Schwarzenegger setting up traps for his enemy at the end of the first movie. Here it seems that the police officer is just lucky. There is no skill, no real obstacle to overcome. The ending does not make any sense, it tries to establish something for a sequel, but fails to provide a proper explanation, creating a huge plot hole.This movie is not even good as a parody and I don't know how 20th Century Fox could distribute this back in the 90s, ruining a franchise that had a lot of potential. In fact more than 10 years passed before Fox decided to give another chance to this franchise. I was extremely disappointed, considering that the first chapter was very well done.",Predator 2
121,mikeiskorn,Exciting!,7,7 March 2021,"A great action packed film. If the first was about Arnie and this showed more of the Pedator side, then that's fine with me. Glover is fantastic, too.

122,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest Action Films And Movie Sequels Of All Time. An Excellent,Underrated Classic.",10,19 March 2013,"Predator 2 is one of the greatest Action movies of all time and one of the greatest sequels of all time and is very underrated. Filled with great direction,brilliant Action,score and fantastic special make-up effects,Predator 2 is not only an excellent classic and not only one of my favorite Action movies,but one of my favorite movies period.Set in Los Angeles,California in 1997,ten years after the first film,Predator 2 tells the story of a futuristic Los Angeles where on the streets L.A cops are battling drug dealing Jamacians and Colombians for control of the streets. When a new Predator comes into the city and starts hunting and killing off Jamacians,Colombians and then cops,maverick tough cop Mike Harrigan(Danny Glover)wants to get the Predator who's in town with a few days to kill.I can not understand for the life of me why Predator 2 has such a mixed reputation with most Predator fans. There's a lot very silly reasons for the mixed reputation,""Arnold wasn't in it"",""Danny Glover was wrong for the role and miscast"",""The City setting was wrong"". Even in 2010 when Predators came out some were even saying that Predators was better than Predator 2. In my opinion all of those reasons are terrible and wrong and while Predators was a good movie in it's own right it is not better than Predator 2. One of the reasons I love Predator 2 is because of the futuristic urban setting in Los Angeles and that right from the beginning it gives us viewers a dark future in 1997 where violence and drugs rule the streets and people are living in a record 110 degree hot weather and where there's no rules. The city of Los Angeles is not a pretty place in 1997 and The Predator picked the right place and right time to hunt big game. What I also love about P2 is that while this film is a sequel to the original,P2 works and becomes it's own film and doesn't try to repeat the same things as the original which I think is a creative and bold move by the filmmakers. P2 is also a great sequel because it expands the universe of the Predator franchise and gives fans surprises and shocks. If the first film was a combination of Rambo and Alien,then P2 is a combination of Lethal Weapon and Alien giving viewers a thrilling and fantastic cop story and becoming it's own film with new characters giving viewers a wonderful Film-Noir detective story with the main characters trying to figure who's doing the killings and why. The main characters like Mike Harrigan,the other cops and the other characters in this film are different from the first which I think is a great thing. If the characters in the first film were strong commandos with huge muscles,the cops in P2 are regular looking people which I think makes the characters look more vulnerable and gives the film a sense of danger especially with the main character Mike Harrigan. Mike Harrigan is a great character who's tough and can fight and is different from Dutch from the first film because when you look at Dutch against the Predator you think he could survive,but with Harrigan you ask will Harrigan survive fighting the Predator? This Predator is a different Predator from the first one. Where as the Predator in the first one was much older and more mature,this Predator is younger and more reckless not hiding all the time and using the city of Los Angeles as his own playground hunting down drug dealers and cops not playing by the rules. The Action scenes in the film are great and are definitely up there with the first film because like the first film's Action there's a build up and intensity and when the Action comes it kicks you in the stomach. The ending of the film is great and lasts about 45 minutes and there isn't a wasted moment. The ending is fast-paced and is an amazing mixture of Action and Suspense. A great ending.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Danny Glover gives an excellent performance as tough cop Lieutenant Mike Harrigan,with Glover bringing toughness and intensity to the performance. And as for some of the fans who said that Glover wasn't right for the role and was miscast they're wrong,Glover was amazing. Kevin Peter Hall is brilliant in his performance as The Predator,giving us the same body language and subtle movements as in the first film. R.I.P Mr. Hall. Gary Busey is amazing as Peter Keyes,an agent who's been after The Predator for years. Ruben Blades does a great job as Danny,Harrigan's partner and friend. Maria Conchita Alonzo gives a great performance as Leona,a tough female cop. Bill Paxton is wonderful and funny in his performance as the new cop Jerry. Adam Baldwin does a good job as Garber,Keyes' right hand man. Calvin Lockhart is creepy and memorable as King Willie,a Jamacian drug lord. Mortan Downey is hilarious as Tony Pope a news reporter. Robert Davi(Captain Heinemann),Kent McCord(Captain Pilgrim)and Henry Kingi(Scorpio)give good performances as well. The direction by Stephen Hopkins is excellent,with Hopkins bringing a dark,Gothic visually stunning atmosphere to the film and using great camera movements. Hopkins also does a great job with the Action scenes and does the Action like it was easy. Great job,Hopkins.The score by Alan Silvestri is brilliant and intense and fits the dark tone of the film and matches the first film's soundtrack. Great score. There's also a few great rap songs from Papa Dee that go with the film.The special make-up effects by Stan Winston is amazing once again and while The Predator is different,the make-up remains the same and is amazing. R.I.P Stan Winston.In final word,if you love the first Predator,Action films or Sci-Fi films I highly suggest you see Predator 2,an excellent,underrated Action classic and brilliant sequel that deserves a second chance. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Predator 2

The Lions, The Tigers, The Bears...Oh My!",7,23 November 2020,After the success of Predator 3 years earlier the task of creating a worthy sequel would be a tough one and although not as good as the original classic it is a very entertaining and competent sequel as Lt Harrigan (Danny Glover) and his team hunt a predator who has been doing hunting of its own in downtown LA but has some resistance in the form of Keyes (Gary Busey) who is also on the hunt. Its a great action film and with Glover and Busey you have actors bringing charisma to the characters,Predator 2
124,Eternality,"A critic sums up best, ""The perfect example of how to bury a franchise quickly and efficiently.""",5,3 August 2010,"If Predator 2 were to be accused of lacking something, it would be the spirit of its predecessor. John McTiernan's Predator was one of the most memorable sci-fi thrillers in the late 1980s. Predator 2 is the opposite - one of the most forgettable. In the tradition of bad sequels, Predator 2 has none of the thrill of the original, and more unfortunately, none of the fascination that the Predator creature once offered to moviegoers.Combined with appalling acting, and 'cheap' special effects, and lots of unnecessary blood and gore, we get something similar to an awful scare fest. It ends rather well for a bad movie (we get to go into the Predator mothership). However, the rest of the movie fails at almost every level. A critic sums up best, ""The perfect example of how to bury a franchise quickly and efficiently."" SCORE: 5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Predator 2
125,ExpendableMan,A worthy follow up that outdoes the original,9,2 September 2007,"There are purists out there who would have you believe that the first Predator movie is the better one. Not so. Predator 2 is by far and away the superior example. Relentlessly bleak and gloriously violent, it is a far, far darker story than its 1987 forebear. Furthermore, it adds a whole new layer to the Predator mythos that wasn't fully covered in the original. Thanks to this film, we got some understanding of the Hunter's culture. They were revealed to be members of an honour bound society with their own castes and structures, rather than blood-letting monsters with no restraint to speak of. Alongside this is Danny Glover's powerful lead role, a vision of Los Angeles as the epicentre of violent culture clashes (foreshadowing the racial tensions that led to the 1992 riots) and some brutally relentless action sequences. And yet despite all this, it's still looked on as the lesser of two movies, when the only argument to suggest this is ""cos, you know, Arnie isn't in it is he?""Set in the then-future 1997, Predator 2 negates the rain-forest location by pitting the Hunter into the concrete jungle of LA. The city is on the brink of collapse, torn apart by street wars between rival drug gangs. Fittingly, the film begins with an out-gunned police force struggling to deal with a trigger happy band of Mexican coke pushers. Arriving at almost the same time are the veteran police man Mike Harrigan (Glover) and the Hunter, who watches and waits, selecting targets to add to the trophy cabinet. One horrific burst of mechanised violence later and Harrigan has a mystery on his hands, involving mutilated corpses and an invisible killer who vanished into thin air. Setting out to solve the case, Harrigan and his fellow officers pursue the Predator while trying to deal with the drug lords and a Government team that knows more than they are telling. Then things get personal when one of Harrigan's friends is killed...Danny Glover is nothing short of brilliant in this film. Older and wiser but more out of shape than Arnie, he is a far more realistic opponent for the Predator to face than the Governator ever was and shows what happens when your average cop fights the alien, rather than a pumped up superman. No disrespect to Arnie, but Glover is also a better actor and inhabits his character completely, going about his job with the same reckless professionalism but also a sense of embittered frustration. Harrigan is no hero, he's just a man who's spent more time in the trenches than most.The Hunter meanwhile is still just as formidable in the second round. This one is a bit more headstrong than the first, not afraid to waltz into the middle of firefights and rip Jamaican gangsters to pieces, but also a bit more vulnerable. The city after all is unfamiliar terrain and Harrigan has mastered their environment, giving him an edge that he perhaps wouldn't have held in the wild. In true sequel fashion meanwhile, the Predator gets a wealth of cool new weapons to play with, including a net made of razor wire, a spear tip launcher and best of all, a shiny metal disc perfect for slicing FBI guys in half.Shame then that the supporting cast isn't quite so colourful as Dillon, Mac, Blaine et al. The eighties action heroine of choice, Maria Conchita Alonso makes a decent appearance as a ball busting cop and she is joined with her Aliens co-star Bill Paxton as the smooth newbie, but neither are as memorable as the commandos were. Thank God then for Gary Busey, chewing up the scenery as the head of the investigation team.Aside from that though, Predator 2 is definitely the better film. It's a lot grittier for one thing, the cartoon gore of the first replaced with some gruelling ordeals. It's also much darker, thanks to the air of urban paranoia and allusions to drug smuggling and prostitution. The only thing that really lets it down is the fact that it relies a bit too heavily on racial stereotyping, but that's easy to forgive when you've got a finale as terrific as this. Lasting over three quarters of an hour, the final bout begins on a packed train, moves to a slaughterhouse where an elite team of specialists take on the Hunter in a frozen abattoir, before Harrigan gives chase to the alien, pursuing him over rooftops, down the the side of buildings and into the dark underbelly of the city. It hasn't got Arnie in it? It doesn't need him.",Predator 2
126,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Underrated decent my personal favorite action slasher film in the franchise almost good as the original,10,6 February 2019,"I don't understand the hate for this film In my opinion Predator 2 is almost good as the original. It is my personal favorite action film it is not better than the first Predator (1987) because original Predator is everyone personal favorite action movie it is mine. This sequel in my opinion is a good action slasher movie as the original, I love this film to death. It has bad-ass good music score theme from Alan Silvestri. Has solid cast, tons of action and gore horror elements in it. It is mixed between those two elements. The Predator Is an alien mysterious fierce adversary with supernatural power. There is a war in Los Angeles a rival Colombian and Jamaicans drug cartels declared war against cops on the streets during the hot summer.The Predator comes to Earth and descending upon a Los Angeles besieged by rival drug gangs in order to hunt for human trophies, one of which could be LAPD Detective Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover). I love the third act of the film which is more interesting.I understand Arnold is not in here, but Danny Glover and Gary Busey did a great job with there characters. Directed was by Stephen Hopkins who also directed Judgment Night (1993) after this movie and he directed solid and well the film I have enjoy it. I love this film not much as the first one but I love it. I would put this movie right above Lethal Weapon I love this movie. I love the rivalry between two leads Danny Glover and Gary Busey they both acted together 3 years earlier in ""Lethal Weapon"" they were much better in here. Gary Busey as Peter Keyes FBI agent was solid excellent I love him in this movie. We also have Rubén Blades, Bill Paxton from Aliens who did a good job as detective and Maria Conchita Alonso who also co started with Schwarzenegger in The Running Man. Elpidia Carrillo as Anna from first Predator (1987) appears in one scene.And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2. Kevin Peter Hall did a solid respectfully acting The Predator in both of the films. This predator has more weapons than the first predator had. Kevin Peter Hall R.I.P. I really miss you. I love the designee for the predator by Stan Winston. This Predator used camouflage and incredible extensive combat skills. I love the horror elements in this movie in which Predator slashes people's heads and he skinned them alive. Predator kills 5 Jamaican gang members in the building. Predator jumps on a train and he kills everyone who is armed. I love the horror elements in which you see a skull on predator's spine. Predator is on a safari ""Lions. The Tigers. The Bears. Oh My..."" . I love that this Predator is tough alien and he is hard to kill, he doesn't let him self getting killed.LAPD Detective Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) is the best bad-ass action hero who goes after Predator him self who killed his best friend. What happens after Mike Harrigan and the Predator appear in the future is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Glover (the hero) and Hall (the villain Predator) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking.Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Hopkins-Glover style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic, Shotguns, Handguns and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The setting is not in in the jungle but it is in the urban jungle and I disagree with Arnold and everyone who say's it is a bad idea. So what if it doesn't take place in the jungle again. The city setting works in my opinion. The skulls of the different species was a great touch too.I love this film I always did it defines my childhood and I disagree with Siskel and Ebert and the Ending was great. I love also female reporters in this movie and police force.I have this movie on DVD and Blu-ray disc they are releasing this movie and the first Predator (1987) in Blu-ray 4k.",Predator 2

The most important reason is that we get to see more screentime with the Predator in his original form, his weapons are upgraded, his kills are getting even better, we see a transition from the jungle to the city which is an amazing job from the director, we see a better character development, a pretty cool fight in the end between the main characters, a beautiful looking alien ship and a cool Alien reference.

128,geminiredblue,An Okay Predator Movie,6,18 December 2013,"The first PREDATOR movie introduced us to the iconic character: an intergalactic hunter with an awesome assortment of high-tech weapons. It was aided further by a stellar performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger. At some point, you knew there had to be a sequel in the works. In PREDATOR 2, the Predator has staked a claim in the Los Angeles of the near future. Armed gangs are running rampant in the streets, as police officers try to maintain law and order. Danny Glover plays a detective who's shocked to find gang members getting butchered in increasingly bloody fashion. As his investigation digs further into the truth, he uncovers a sinister plot involving Gary Busey and the government. And yes, the Predator gets to do what he does best: Slaughter in a variety of eye-poppingly creative ways. While it's pretty good as a sequel, the film is just ""okay."" No-one's character, including Danny Glover's, is all that interesting. Moving the location from the jungles of Central America to the streets of LA doesn't seem to work as well either.

Alien Hunting Ground,2,21 July 2017,"Awful sequel to the 1987 classic starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, where this time, the protagonism passes into the hands of the cuttlefish-faced Danny Glover (""The Color Purple"", ""Lethal Weapon""), in which is undoubtedly one of the worst interpretations of his career. He even moves his ""Lethal Weapon"" character to this film, a cantankerous cop!And that's not all: Bill Paxton, Arnie's co-star in ""Terminator"", fills his place in this sequel. That doesn't mean that half a loaf is better than no bread.This rough sequel was made for those who, after seeing the first, imagined what it would be like if Predator climbed an urban bus and the balconies of the flats instead of climbing the jungle palm trees. It was a HUGE success that Arnie decided to star in ""Total Recall"" instead of starring in this bullshit of movie. The same goes to the director of the first, John McTiernan, who dodged a bullet directing in the same year ""The Hunt of the Red October"".This sequel honors the saying of ""Second parts were never good,"" and supposed the beginning of the end for the alien character of ""Predator"", since the poor have not taken advantage of good way in any of the sequels that have been made , They are all a garbage, and when they put it so that it was faced against Alien, already was the height of absurdity.In this returns Kevin Peter Hall from the first one, but newcomers as: Maria Conchita Alonso (""Running Man""), Robert Davi (""Raw Deal"", ""Licence to Kill""), Gary Busey (""Lethal Weapon"") complete the recurring roles.A piece of garbage. To see if they leave in peace the films of Schwarzenegger, and they do not make more sequels shreds of their films nor more remakes, that they are well as they are!!The movie is not that there is much good to say. Bad if, and a lot, although it is so insubstantial and lacking in interest that I do not know if it's worth it to waste time dissecting such a mess, since it is also one of the sequels that piss me off, so I'll say something to Mr. Hopkins , sure you read me.Look Stephen...Steve...we know you're mediocre, you just have to see your intolerable ""Lost in Space"" (1998) to realize that you do not have much to offer us, so I do not understand how you embarked on a project like this and you produced such colossal garbage. Can you promise me that you'll continue with your crappy ""The Reaping"" films and leave our favorite bugs alone? I hope so, I and many more will thank you.",Predator 2
130,jerekra,Gets Pretty Good At The End.,7,4 February 2009,"Predator 2 is the second film in the predator series. While not nearly as good as the first Predator it is not a bad movie.Basically the plot is similar to the first film but this time the Predator hunts down people in Los Angeles.Schwarzennegar is not in this film. He was awesome in the first Predator so it is kind of sad that he is not in the sequel. However you should also remember that the Predator is more important to the film than Arnold was. However still I was hoping he would be in this film.Danny Glover instead plays the lead in this film. WHile not nearly as good as Schwarzenneggar he is a good actor, not great but good. Glover does a decent job in the lead but he uses some of the worst language you will hear in a film.The rest of the supporting characters in this film I did not like at all. Predator 2 has a really bad cast compared to the first predator. There are no Carl Weathers and Jessie Venturas to bolster this cast, instead there are Gary Buseys and BIll Paxtons. Paxton is awful in this film. The supporting cast in this film is not developed enough so that when some of them die you do not feel sad for them like when the characters in the original died.Another thing I did not care for was how bad the language was at times. It seems that everyone just says bad words just to do it and it really kills the dialogue.I did like things in the film though.One thing I liked is that they further develop and show you new things about the predator that were not known in the first. Like how they only attack species that have weopons, do not attack children with fake weopons, and do not attacks expectant mothers. This goes to show that they are not all bad and that they have morals which is good. Basically they think that the Predator may have killed everyone but that is proved to be false if you think about it because of the morals that I just spoke of. The Predator gets in a lot of action and there is one extremely funny part involving the Predator in an old womans bathroom.Also the duel between Glover and the Predator is pretty good. It is great action and a pretty intense battle.This film has a pretty sub par plot and bad language but it also develops the Predator in a good way and has some great action. An above average film but not without its flaws. I do recommend it though.",Predator 2

132,Gresh854,Exceptional Sequel,6,5 September 2018,"Not bad. Not bad at all. Danny Glover V Predator is a decently steady follow-up to the original action-heavy, sci-fi blended cult classic. I absolutely dug the new Los Angeles setting; it gave me some nostalgic Escape From New York/Robocop vibes. The acting is overtly over-the-top, but that sort-of adds to the pleasant ludicrousness of the film. We also get some more fearsome Predator moments, even a healing sequence which I did not ever predict I'd need until now. There's some vigorously unexplained nonsense occurring regularly in Predator 2, but I mean, come on, it's a Predator movie, I'm not asking for a perfect action masterpiece, just a elementary, lively, cheesy, unwinded thriller, and that's essentially what this sequel granted me with.

Unlike the first hunter, however, this individual appears to be older, more cunning, more ruthless, and better equipped with more high-tech weaponry. Even with government agents on the creature's trail, it will take the tough-as-nails cop Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) to take down the ultimate hunter.Undeniably awesome, Predator 2 has the same charm as the first movie while bringing in its own brand of coolness to it. The cast is great. Danny Glover's character doesn't mess around and will stop at nothing until this monster goes down, a worthy successor to Arnold's character Dutch as the film's protagonist. Bill Paxton, who has had his share of Terminator and Alien action, now has deal with the Predator while being the comic relief in this movie. There's a lot of action to keep this movie going, especially the final confrontation that makes up for the one-sided beat-down Arnold gets in the previous film.

134,Mr_Censored,Murtaugh Vs. Predator,5,27 March 2009,"Transplanted from one jungle to another, ""Predator 2"" finds our favorite alien with a fetish for gun-play hunting the streets of Los Angeles, during an intense heat-wave and an escalating gang war. Danny Glover (of Lethal Weapon fame) plays the Lieutenant bound to break all the rules and get down the bottom of a string of mysterious deaths that leave its victims skinless. Dealing with a cocky new cop (Bill Paxton) and a mysterious government official (Gary Busey) bound and determined to undermine his authority, our flawed hero finds that gang violence is a cake-walk compared to what intergalactic game hunters have in store for his city.Directed by Stephen Hopkins (""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"") and written by Jim & John Thomas (the men who brought the first ""Predator"" to life), ""Predator 2"" is a much different beast than its predecessor. Hopkins, who got his start in horror (and it shows) is much more interested in setting up the mood and a few stalk sequences than he is on mind-numbing action. In stark contrast to the original, this one has a much slower pace, fits into the horror genre a little neater, and, unfortunately, is a lot less efficient in doing so. The biggest problem with the movie is that it can't settle on one mood. At times it feels like a b-movie, or a tacky horror/monster movie. On the other hand, it attempts (and fails) at some social commentary, dating itself in the process. What results in the end is a nice-looking film without much below the surface. I suppose it didn't require much effort to write something as lean and mean as the first, but it's remarkable at how unremarkable the story of ""Predator 2"" is. Aside from some more elaboration on The Predator itself (which may or may not be a good thing) there is hardly anything worth writing home about. You might enjoy the shocking death scenes, the bizarre weapons that The Predator and the cops shoot each other with, and Heck, if you haven't subjected yourself to the ""Alien Vs. Predator"" flicks yet, you might appreciate a subtle nod to that ""other"" alien franchise. It earns points for its solid cast, with Glover and Busey playing themselves while a fresh-faced Paxton hams it up. Otherwise, what we have here is a typical, moderately enjoyable, but utterly forgettable and inferior sequel. All the more credit to the makers of the film for trying something different than the first.

This, on the other hand is simply a bad film, despite moments when it is trying, with quite dire results, to be ""funny"". One must suppose that the director or producer thought it was stroke of genius to cast the utterly moronic micro-celebrity and has-been Morton Downey Jr  as , get this, a tabloid TV celebrity. ( Wow, what a stretch for his ""talents""). One must also suppose that the swordcane wielding ganja/rasta/reggae/ voodooman was INTENDED as a comic creation.One must even suppose that the Bill Paxton character was intended to be funny as well as dashing, brave, macho, etc.But there is no need to belabor this. Predator 2 was, simply put, one of the worst films of 1990. Danny Glover is fairly good, and The Gary Busey character is amusingly obsessive- thanks to Buseys  hammy acting, NOT the brain-dead script, but on the whole this a film to avoid., or , perhaps, a film one should only watch as part of a ""bad film festival' on the same bill as Universal Soldier,Road House, Maximum Overdrive, and others of that ilk.",Predator 2
136,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Predator 2 (1990),4,6 March 2008,"Not as good as the first film. It was average. At times it was hard to keep paying attention. Now i have watched Alien, Aliens, Predator and now Predator 2. This is the worse of the bunch so far. But i am yet to see Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. Judging from the first two Alien movies. Alien is the way to go. Now that i have watched both Predator movies i don't think they are as special as any other movie. I really don't see what makes them so special.A big problem i have with this movie is that it shows us interesting things. But then they tell us nothing about it. Its like your friend saying ""I got a big secret but i'm not going to tell you"". It seems they are making way for Predator 3 but i have seen nothing about another sequel. It can be irritating.The acting was OK. Danny Glover has never been a good actor in my eyes. At times he over-acted and other times he under-acted.Another problem was the Predator. In the first movie he was a smart and brilliant killer. In this he seemed stupid and sloppy. But i don't know if it was the Predator from the first film.There were some good bits. There was some decent action scenes and great lines. But that is all there is really.Only see this if you have seen the first film.4/10",Predator 2

This time without Arnold Schwarzenegger, but with Mr.Lethal Weapon himself: Danny Glover. This was sort of unusual to me, since I'm more used to see him in comedies. The location are now no longer a jungle in Central America, but Los Angeles. There are a street war going on in the movie between different drug-gangs, but that's not the most important. Of course, that is Glover and his investigation that eventually leads him to the Predator. Gary Busey is in this movie too, as leader of a special team specializing on the Predator. Although he's a good guy here, he seems like the same asshole he always does. Overall, I have to warn viewers about this movie, because it isn't any good.

140,nims-1975,Predator 2 is an absolutely amazing and awesome film,10,31 May 2020,"Predator 2 came out in 1990 3 years after the first Predator film in 1987. It doesn't or didn't matter that Arnold Schwarzenegger was not in the sequel because the sequel had an excellent cast and also had Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator. Predator 2 is an action packed sci fi horror but the sequel is not set in the jungle it is set in the streets of Los Angeles. Predator 2 is set in 1997 and the streets of Los Angeles are very dangerous and are torn apart by extremely violent battles between the extremely ruthless, violent, malicious, dangerous and maniacal Colombian drug gangs, Jamaican drug gangs and the beleaguered Los Angeles Police Force. Lt Mike Harrigan(played by Danny Glover) is a powerful and firm LAPD Lieutenant and wants to do things his way with the help of the other LAPD Cops. One other thing that has happened and got Lt Mike Harrigan feeling shocked and suspicious is that something out there has killed many people and has left them absolutely slaughtered and skinned alive with their bodies hanging high up above, some of them the Colombians and the Jamaicans. The thing that the cops don't know is that there dealing with an Alien called The Predator. When FBI Agent Keyes(played by Gary Busey) is introduced to Lt Mike Harrigan by Cpt Phil Heinemann(played by Robert Davi and Cpt Pilgrim(played by Kent McCord). Keyes is a big egoed and stubborn nemesis who Lt Mike Harrigan doesn't like but has to put up with. More deaths keep happening by The Predator including one of the LAPD Cops Danny Archuleta(played by Ruben Blades) who the other cops loved. Jerry Lambert(played by Bill Paxton) is introduced to the LAPD and Lt Mike Harrigan wants Jerry and Leona Cantrell(played by Maria Conchita Alonso) to find out as much as they can about Keyes because Lt Mike Harrigan is suspicious about his nemesis Keyes and thinks that he's responsible for Danny's death. When they find out that Keyes has and is doing things to cause problems, Lt Mike Harrigan is furious about what he sees and reads about Keyes. Leona and Jerry work together in dealing with the violent battles/ killings that are happening in L. A and are eventually killed on a Train alongside many other people by The Predator. Things get a lot more tougher for Lt Harrigan because all the members of his team have been killed by The Predator and it's just him now who has to kill The Predator. The FBI want to see Lt Mike Harrigan, and when he's with them Keyes tells Harrigan using computers and graphical images what they are able to see and what they are dealing with and that they are dealing with an Alien. Keyes and his team can see The Predator on the building rooftop and Keyes wants to go out on the rooftop, meet the Predator and kill it. Keyes is fascinated by The Predators sophisticated weapons and The Predator itself and wants to kill it, but Keyes is big egoed and stubborn and thinks he can destroy The Predator himself but the thing is when Keyes is on the rooftop his life is in danger and doesn't know that The Predator is a very advanced hi tech Alien with a powerful Arsenal and that The Predator is lethal. Keyes is full of ego, thinks he's more powerful than The Predator and will win but he couldn't and got easily destroyed by The Predator. Predator 2 is as good as the first Predator film, it may not as be as fast as it but Predator 2 has it's own speed and it is an absolutely brilliant sci fi horror film which does have some spooky and scary scenes and is also filled with action, violence, tension, horror, awesome and amazing special effects. This film is also more about The Predator, who he is etc and you also got to see more of him in this film. The Predator also had more weapons in this film, his weapons were extremely powerful and awesome. The films main three characters Harrigan played by Danny Glover, Keyes by Gary Busey and The Predator by Kevin Peter Hall really stood out in this film. Predator 2 is a film which I definitely recommend and also has some absolutely brilliant acting by Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Kevin Peter Hall, Ruben Blades, Maria Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin and Kent McCord.",Predator 2
141,bayardhiler,Just As Good As The First One.......,9,29 September 2013,"Okay, maybe not quite as good as the first one but come on folks; it's pretty damn close. As many of you probably know already, ""Predator 2"" was the highly anticipated sequel to the 1987 hit and upon its release has inspired countless hours of debate over the years as to whether it's great or dreck. It should probably go without saying that I myself consider it to be an excellent sci-fi/horror picture infused with a certain urban grittiness and the dark underbelly of metropolitan America. Set in the mean streets of Los Angeles in the year 1997, the story revolves around a viscous drug war that has grown out of control for most of the cops. Most of the cops that is, except for a handful of detectives led by LT. Mike Harrigan (played by Danny Glover with the same tenacity that he showed in ""Lethal Weapon""), a tough as nails street warrior who does whatever it takes to get the job done. However, it soon becomes apparent that not all of the killing is being done by humans as a mysterious team of govt. agents come to town led by Peter Keyes (played by Gary Busey with his typical crazy zeal) and the fact that the physical evidence just isn't making much sense. It doesn't take long to figure out that he's back; that alien with a face that only mom could love! The first thing that makes the movie as good as it is would be the setting of Los Angeles. If you think about it, moving the setting from the jungle to the big city was very risky and despite what the detractors say, it works. It brings the grittiness that one sees all too often in the urban jungles into the mix which helps create a sort of crime thriller/slasher story for the characters, thus making the story more intriguing even though we already know what the killer is. The second thing that adds to the movie is Danny Glover's performance of Harrigan. Some might say that Glover was miscast in the movie, that he can't do action movies like Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Well, to those I ask what category would you consider the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies to fall under? Romance? Oscar? Shakespearean drama? Of course not! And although Glover is once more playing a cop, he does a good job distinguishing Harrigan from Dect. Murtaugh in the ""Weapon"" films. Murtaugh if you recall, was always the reserved one, the one who didn't want to do anything crazy but always ended up doing so because of his partner Briggs. Harrigan on the other hand, just doesn't give a sh**. Except when it comes to heights, that is. Finally, there is the predator itself, played once more by the late great Kevin Peter Hall. Although he is covered in makeup from head to toe, Hall gives the predator every bit of a unique personality and attitude that many actors probably couldn't if they were in a similar situation. The writers also give the predators new weapons such as the retractable staff and a flying ""frisbee"" of death. Plus, there's a little bit more teeth on the predator's makeup this time around which only adds to its awesomeness. The movie also stars Bill Paxton with his usual bigger than life persona, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, the supportive Ruben Blades, the always memorable Robert Davi, and in a well done performance of a particularly slimy TV reporter, the late Morton Downey Jr. To sum it up, don't listen to the detractors; watch the movie yourself and see a time when Hollywood still took risks with great results.",Predator 2

Arnold missing is the least of this movies problems. Everything in this movie is annoying from the moment it starts.

144,NerdBat,A Milestone,6,19 April 2018,"Don't get me wrong, I still feel like the first film was the most important to the series, but as someone else said, this one tends to focus more on the Predator rather than those being attacked by him. I will admit it tends to go a bit far with the vulgar humor and language, so much so its like one of those syfy original films where if its disgusting, it gets said by someone at some point.

No main star from the original, different director, it just seemed to reek of cash in failure.But in truth, this film is a rare gem. It's different to the first film yes but it's popularity as a cult classic is undeniable. The film paints it's own unique story instead of thieveing off of and re-treading the first instalment. The Predator itself is given much more of a personality this time, with the kills being more obviously trophies rather than just butchering everything and it is given much more of a background and don't forget, this is the film that gained widespread popularity about the concept of these creatures verses the Aliens with the now infamous 'trophy room scene'.The film races along like most movies of the era, i.e. very good and is possibly one of the last action films to be purely an action film before CGI really started to poke it's nose in about a year later.It would have been interesting to see Schwarzenegger in the film for curiosity's sake, even for a cameo but people just don't seem to see the genius of casting Danny Glover. The film takes the original and flips it on it's head, instead of the South American jungle we get a concrete jungle, and instead of a buffed, super trained commando type we get a middle aged, overweight black cop with street smarts and an attitude which gives the Predator a whole new adversary to try and outsmart.Predator was a great mid 80's defining action film. This sequel is as much a defining action film of it's own era (late 80's, early 90's) as the first one along with Total Recall and Batman and should not be overlooked as a flimsy follow up because it simply isn't.

147,chvylvr80,This is on a par with Predator,7,11 September 2003,"Yes, you may not agree with me but I think that Predator 2 was as good as Predator and it even had something the first movie lacked: more screen time for the Predator. The Predator movies are a fan boy's dream come true as the Predator is arguably the best alien on film. The Alien movies and The Thing nonwithstanding. It's not Citizen Kane or anything but the film has plenty of action, decent performances and plenty of the Predator, including the showing off of a few new gadgets of his. I always liked the fact that Predator 2 is set in an urban environment, the jungle is too remote. Not enough prey you see. Although Los Angeles 1997 doesn't look like that then or now,(most parts anyway), the movie does a good job of putting the Predator in what I like to call a target rich environment. Danny Glover isn't Arnold but he does a good job as the lead anyway. Arnold didn't make the first movie good, the Predator did. I think a lot of you miss that. The late Kevin Peter Hall does as well as you can ask from a character with no lines or facial expressions to speak of. Bottom Line: A decent follow-up to Predator. If you haven't seen it yet check it out.",Predator 2
148,tom_koopa,"Not as mysterious as the prequel, but still a good movie",7,21 May 2009,"Predator 2 isn't really a sequel, in the way that it follows Dutch who barely escaped the creature in the prequel. Instead, this movie focuses on a different cast, in a different environment.The jungle has been replaced with an urban one.This movie isn't kidding around. Hard-core actions and language are the core of the film. As said in the movie several times: ""This is war"". A war between drug gangs and all sorts of thugs, dominating the life on the street.In all this chaos, the Predator hunts.It's a wild goose chase at first, which slowly changes into a determined hunt for the creature, as it kills more and more people.Predator 2 showed a lot of new gadgets and weapons for the creature, which were used again in AvP and AvP2. It also added more depth to the creature's background.One thing is what this movie lacks: mystery. Partially because you already know WHAT the Predator is and what it does. But the fact that it now lurks amongst the roof tops and buildings, doesn't just crawl under your skin like it did in a real jungle of the prequel.Acting, music and story are still excellent.

Shane Black made some questionable decisions when it came to the directing and editing, and, alongside his buddy Fred Dekker, the screenwriting, which led to a nonsensical plot, bad dialogue, weak story, unfunny comedy, and ridiculous plotholes. However, as bad as that movie is, I can at least sit and enjoy it if I don't take it seriously. This movie, however, I can't enjoy no matter how I try to watch it. Why? Well:While the dialogue in ""The Predator"" was bad, the dialogue for this movie is even worse.The characters are either cliched or just annoying or uninteresting.The acting was meh.The pacing is atrocious.This movie has some of the worst ADR I've ever seen.It looks hideous.Cop movie cliches.Killed my partner. Gonna get revenge.The editing was obnoxious.There was some really forced stuff:
Keyes' man shooting his tank. He just kept shooting it. And it took several bullets to pierce the tank? Okay.Keyes expositing to Harrigan in the trailer. First off, he tells us stuff we already know and would've been able to figure out on our own, and why would he bother telling Harrigan this stuff? In fact, why would he keep him alive?The bomb in the first movie destroyed enough Jungle to cover 300 city blocks? I doubt it. Think about it.Is this movie devoid of merit? No. For example:Kevin Peter Hall once again kills it as the titular creature.The costume they made for Kevin is fantastic, even by today's standards.I like the scene where Harrigan says, ""Okay. Who's next?"" That was actually funny.Bill Paxton also goes all-out in the movie, as he tended to do.The movie introduces some pretty cool Predator gadgets: The Smart Disc. Multiple vision settings.

It could have used a little more police-procedural feel to it. But it did a good job. It is entertaining enough for multiple watches. I thought that some scenes, I could do without. It needed about 20 minutes more content than it had. It felt like the story was rushing to some crescendo. The ending was the worst part.

Predator 2 is filled with DRY HUMOR and TONGUE-IN-CHEEK throughout mostly the beginning to the middle of the movie which pretty much ruined the movie. Then on top of the near comedy dialog and absolutely stupid gunfight scenes at the beginning, some of which were comparably right out of a Leslie Neilson Naked Gun there were ridiculous scenes such as where they just walked out of LA Police Administration building and the vehicles in the street are all 1950's and 1960's vintage cars including THREE IDENTICAL RED MUSTANG COUPES in the traffic next to each other in the same shot (00:40:25 in the movie). The Gangstas in the gold Cadillac with the zebra vinyl top that had bong smoke billowing out of it would have been right at home in a Cheech and Chong movie
Finally about half way through the move after the subway metro scene the movie straightens up and gets serious.

This film focuses on ACTION; and it delivers!My favorite parts are: 1) when the 'Predator' crushes up glass and plaster, spreads magic goo on it, sets it on fire in a small blast furnace he carries, then spreads it on his owwies to stop his leaking green blood (!); and 2) the circular weapon that keeps on cutting, even after it encounters considerable mass! I want one of those; AND that fancy collapsible spear! Does Walmart have them, ya-think?The film is really about how much grit a person has to combat an evil force -- who -- get this -- isn't there for love or money, just the trophies (Read: skulls) of his conquered victims.

The creature design on this Predator is disappointing, and doesn't come close to the coolness of the first one -- even if this one has a huge (seemingly impossible to hold) spear and smart-disk. The story is sloppy, as well as the tone and atmosphere. There's elements missing from the first (gore, characters we can relate to and root for) that made it so good, and elements added here that go just too far: the nudity.All in all, definitely skip this if you liked or loved the first Predator movie.

160,moviemattb,"Schwarzenegger or not, its at least entertaining",7,14 October 2018,"When I watched the bonus features of the first ""Predator"" movie, a poster for ""Predator 2"" pops up, and I never would expected that there was a sequel to ""Predator."" So I checked out the trailer for this movie on Video Detective, and I thought it look very intense. I did watch this on television, alongside with my little brother; it was TV-edited and I thought I loved it. As time went one, I bought the DVD as a 2-Disc set, and my opinion has changed as I thought ""Eh, it was okay, no Schwarzenegger, but not bad at all."" Now, as I watched this movie a couple a days ago, and I really end up enjoying it for what it is, than I ever give credit for. The movie takes place in Los Angeles of 1997, as crime was out of hand, where Mike Harrigan is trying to end the war, but gets stalked by a Predator, where it hunts and slaughters some more. Now Harrigan must face the Predator, and give everything all that he has got. Yes, its not as good as the first movie, but its not really that bad. Here is why: the movie is directed by Stephen Hopkins, who would go on to direct ""Lost in Space,"" ""Judgement Night,"" ""The Ghost and the Darkness,"" ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers,"" ""Race,"" and is well known for directing the fifth ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" movie. I thought he has done a fairly decent job on making this an entertaining movie. He is no John McTiernan, but didn't do a bad job either. The special effects for the most part are good, despite some bad outlines. Stan Winston still does a great job for designing the Predator, while Kevin Peter Hall does a great job for portraying the Predator. It is cool to see all the toys the Predator uses, and showing the side of its character for what it kills and doesn't kill. The action scenes are really well done, and the atmosphere itself is fine in its own right. The music by Alan Silvestri is really good, and it really does make my blood pumping whenever an action scene pops up. Also, its really one of his best scores that he has done in his career. The cast in this movie all did good, and like the first one they're not three dimensional, but they're at least likable. Danny Glover doesn't need to be like Schwarzenegger, but he was good enough to be his own character, and does give a good performance. Gary Busey plays a good human bad guy, Bill Paxton is also fun, despite the fact he is ripping his role from ""Aliens."" Sure it would be something to see both Glover and Schwarzenegger sharing some scenes together, but it is what it is. The story is not as engaging as the first one, but its not bad. There are some moments that I thought were bad such as the Predator getting struck by lighting as if it where ""He-Man."" Also, the Predator in the bathroom, where it jabs a needle to its chest, and makes that weird sound which for some reason makes me laugh. Not intentional, but couldn't help but laugh. ""Predator 2"" I thought was good enough to be an entertaining movie that has good action set pieces, decent suspenseful moments, great music, good performances, and some memorable lines of dialogue. Schwarzenegger or not, its at least entertaining. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",Predator 2

Danny glover is wonderful in the role as a total BA police officer and Gary Busey is good as the black ops government agent.This film is good, give it a chance and you won't be too disappointed.",Predator 2
162,quadrophenia-69524,Memories....,1,4 May 2021,I watched this film when I was young and loved it watching it just recently I have to say it was dumb you could tell from the start that this film was made on a film set the shooting scene at the start I was expecting the director to come out shout cut. Then the film just goes down hill from there Danny Glover was good but the other actors where all a bit wooden and the lead Jamaican guy willy I think he could have had bit more to do as he only lasts so long which was dissapointing.,Predator 2
163,scott-sw,Great sequel!,8,3 December 2007,"Call me disrespectful or even blasphemous, I liked Predator 2 better than the original. Three years after a claw-faced alien hunter eliminated a US Army Rescue Team stuck in the jungles of Central America, another alien drops in to takes its place and have a hunt in Los Angeles. Such is the premise for Predator 2. However, while the first Predator was twenty years ago, the time frame for Predator 2 is 1997 - ten years after the South American incident. However, this time a top secret government agency led by Gary Busey knows about the creature. They have gone by the testimony by the two survivors of the first Predator (although neither appear in the sequel). Busey also relates witnesses have seen the creature in Iwo Jima, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Apparently, the creature is drawn by heat and conflict. No wonder this one takes place amidst the drug wars of Los Angeles While conflict and gore are much like the first movie, there are aspects of Predator 2 which are imaginative and different. One fun aspect was Morton Downey, Jr as an over zealous reporter. Another was the use of science by the good guys. While the first movie has military grunts guessing about the creature, this top team knows the Predator can only see in the infra-red spectrum. We also learn a little more about the Predator itself. Believe it or not, it show ethics in its hunt. For example, in one scene when the creature attacks a commuter train, the cops are amazed that the only ones attacked were the armed civilians. Moreover, it spares one cop who was pregnant. Also, the last 30 to 40 minutes will physically wear an audience out. It is the typical out-of-the-frying pan into-the-fire suspense as Danny Glover attempts to confront the creature in a long chase sequence. It is also good to see that Danny accomplishes what Arnold couldn't. The best part is a wonderful twist on the ending, but to reveal that would truly be a crime. It does have some pratfalls, though. First is the very prejudicial lens of the story. Every Jamaican is obsessed with voodoo, drugs, and violence. Moreover, the violence and profanity pushes the limits even for hardcore testosterone freaks like me. Finally, the acting is less to be desired. With so many action stars like Danny Glover, Gary Busey, and Bill Paxton, you shouldn't expect a whole lot. Of course that is to be expected in an action film. But just once, can we do without a cop who is always obnoxious, smart-mouthed, smarter than his superiors, over zealous and reckless? Despite the flaws, action freaks will definitely enjoy Predator 2.",Predator 2
164,dudedazzreviews,Predator should never have had a sequel!,4,12 October 2010,"Last time it landed in the jungle. This time, it's chosen Los Angeles. Ravaged by open warfare between rival drug gangs, L.A. is the perfect killing ground for the Predator, who is drawn by heat and conflict. When the police find mutilated bodies, Lieutenant Mike Harrigan thinks it's the work of the feuding gangs. Then a mysterious government agent arrives and orders him to stay off the case. Instead, Harrigan sets out to learn what is really going on, and comes face to face with the savage alien in a climatic, electrifying confrontation After watching the brilliant first Predator movie, I must admit that I didn't really have high hopes for this movie and I was right in doing so. The story is quite weak and has been done before in the first movie except for this time, it's in Los Angeles. The characters weren't written very well as you really couldn't care what they had to say or what happened to them at all. The acting was mediocre, Danny Glover gives out a great performance as usual in most of his movies but it's a shame that it can't be said for the rest of the cast who starred in this disastrous sequel. The writing wasn't really very good at all and the direction wasn't bad but it could have been better. There were some good action sequences but that's all Predator 2 really has to offer. All in all, a disappointing and pointless sequel to the brilliant Predator.I really wanted to like this, I really did but I just couldn't get into it at all. I thought there were some okay scenes but it just wasn't enough as the story starts off weak and remains so to the end. I thought the acting was very average, Danny Glover did a good job as usual but the rest of the cast were pretty bad. It's very unfortunate for Danny Glover as his talents are just wasted in this movie. I think one of the big problems with Predator 2, except for the story, was the characters in the movie. I just didn't really care for any of them! I didn't care what they said, I didn't care whether they would stay in the movie or not, I just couldn't care for any of them. Everything was just bad except for Danny Glover and some of the scenes done in the movie. If you loved the first one and think the second one will be bigger and better, stop thinking that because it's not. If you keep your expectations very low, then there's a chance you may enjoy this, however I didn't. If you like sci-fi horror movies, you might like this.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Predator 2
165,fletchy-57354,Perfect sequel,8,4 March 2021,Predator 2 gives you exactly what you want and more. Definitely underrated and needs more attention. Compared to The predator (2019) this film is a masterpiece. Danny glover is solid.,Predator 2
166,Newsense,Rumble in the concrete jungle,10,7 February 2009,"I remember when I first saw Predator 2 I didn't think it was better than it's predecessor but it was still loads of fun.Premise: Predator stalks it's prey in Los Angeles right in the middle of a gang war between a Hispanic gang and a Jamaican gang. Lt. Harrigan(Danny Glover) investigate the bizarre murders of these gang members while a special agent named Keyes(Gary Busey) plans to capture the Predator to study it.Opinion: Predator 2 is an action packed ride with a few flaws. The only person you get to know is the hot-headed Harrigan. Everybody else in the movie comes and goes. Danny's anger is over the top sometimes. But the the storyline is decent and Harrigan stood his ground and fought Predator to a standstill like Dutch did without getting a royal buttkicking like Dutch got. The best scene would have to be where Predator wreaks havoc in the subway train. Predator 2 was trying to be its own story not copy of the original. And for those of you bashed it because of Roger Ebert lets not forget that he gave Rocky And Bullwinkle, Blair Witch Project, Indecent Proposal, Cheaper By The Dozen 2, Conan The Destroyer, Spun and hold your breath Speed 2 and Home Alone 3 thumbs up! Think about that next time you blindly accept his opinion at face value. At any rate, if you are looking for a great sequel Predator 2 will not disappoint.",Predator 2
167,Aries_Primal,Kinda dissapointed,5,16 February 2018,"Another movie trying to surn american cop into a hero. I am huge fan of predator but there were a few too obvious mistakes. First when the female cop standed against Predator at the subway he saw she was pregnant, the baby was turned with head up since I know baby's head must point down only if there is no pregnancy problem. 
I just could not miss the way Harrigan lost his gun at the slaughterhouse and Predator jut crashed it as it was made of plastic. Or it was. No matter how strong he is, iron hit on the ground can't turn into pieces. And btw when Predator throw that disc he cut the other cop on two, a bucket of blood just came from the upper part of the body, but it never came to the ground. Probably it was busy with something more important.
But the big fail is coming at this site, why you should ruin it showing the actor playing the Predator? First movie never announced it and it was for better. Details are important, you know.",Predator 2
168,HotDoggyBoomBooM,just one word - UNDERRATED,10,2 March 2021,I never seen danny glover's flicks but this movie is the best. nothing more to say and it's sad that they made this go away just like that.,Predator 2
169,boondocksaint20,A worthy sequel,8,2 October 2002,"First off, I'll say that this film is actually quite good, but is not as good as the first movie b\c it definitely had a lot to measure up to from the 1987 hit.  The first one was brilliant with its claustrophobic atmosphere and interesting characters that were very cool and made us feel a slight pang of loss as they got dispatched by the Predator.  The atmosphere was one of the key elements in the first movie, and it also gave Arnie a real challenge for a change (Whose blood didn't get pumping when Arnie pulled his 'Heart of Darkness' boyscout tricks in a all out fight with the Predator?).With all of that said, I'd like to say that I really like this movie. Though there are some kinks in it as well as some bad dialogue, it is overall a pretty exciting movie.  I think it's safe to say that there is quite a bit more bloodshed this time around, which is good and bad.  It is good b\c the action scenes are, simply put, awesome.  The war between the cops, the drug dealers and the Predator is always no-holds-barred, and though some of it is definitely Hollywood (I didn't know drug dealers had access to military weaponry?) there are a lot of realistic and also daring scenes (the subway shootout is definitely one of them).  The bad part of the excessive action is that there really isn't as much tension in the stalking process this time around.  Though, the first time I saw this, I was 10 years old and excitedly scared out of my wits by this film (and who wouldn't be? The Predator is one of the most horrific killers ever to grace the silver screen), it doesn't quite have the build up when Arnie and his troops were being stalked in the jungle.  However, there are still quite a few tense moments as well as good scares in this film especially since the Predator is one frightening looking SOB!The best part that I loved about this movie was the way they portrayed the Predator.  When I was a kid, I just saw him as a mindless killing machine, but this now, after watching it recently, I saw how they portrayed him with an ethical code of honor with whom he kills and how (noone that he considers a real threat).  I notice his favorite method is to methodically kill everyone in a group, by any means necessary and then spare the bravest or toughest opponent for a one-on-one battle.  I think it was genious how the creature stalked Harrigan after witnessing his heroics in the beginning and how the movie never blatantly pointed it out (via someone to explain it all to the audience).  Definitely an interesting idea, which is rare for a sequel. The acting is pretty good, overall.  Danny Glover did a good job with his role as Harrigan as well as Bill Paxton (who, by the way, has one of the coolest pre-death scenes ever).  The dialogue lacks in some areas, but is made up with the solid directing and pulse pounding score by Alan Silvestri. The script could have used some fine tuning, but the action never lets up and the movie, as a whole, is paced very well.  All in all, this is a worthy sequel to one of Arnie's best.  I don't understand why so many people on this board put up negative reviews for this movie, despite the flaws mentioned above.  I think the filmmakers put a little more thought into the average action film and it shows. Overall, this is an entertaining movie to watch on a quiet Friday night after work, with a nice cold beer and a pack of cigarettes at your disposal. Like many on this board have said, it is a underrated gem.  Now when can we expect Aliens vs. Predator, already?!?  8/10",Predator 2
170,fibreoptic,You can't see the eyes of the Demon until him come callin,10,24 August 2004,"Now i love the original to this but unlike the majority of people i think that this one is the best of the two. It doesn't have Arnie, true but did Arnie really make the first one so great? I don't think so. Gary Busey is in this along with Danny Glover. I do think this movie has its faults but it's so much fun, it's so exciting and adds so much to the Predator universe including the start of the 14 year wait for Alien Vs Predator which ended up not being really worth the wait for. It's all about another Predator who lands near Los Angeles in the middle of a blisteringly hot heatwave. It witnesses a cop played by Danny Glover take on a couple of warring drug gangs which impresses it no end so it decides that Glover is the worthy prey it needs to hunt whilst being hunted itself by a top secret Government organisation lead by Gary Busey.*Slight Spoiler*Predator 2 is full of thrills, excitement, spooky terrifying atmosphere just like the first and gore. The characters are just as deep as the original too. We find out more about the predator too in this. The only thing that maybe irks me a bit is that realistically Danny Glover is nowhere near capable of defeating a predator mainly due to the fact that he is just a cop and he is kind of fat unlike Arnie's character in the first who was an elite commando leader but that can be explained away as luck. Danny Glover is one lucky S.O.B. in this.In Predator 2 we have drug gangs, drug wars, drug lords (gotta love King Willy who says the coolest line ever in movie history), top weapons, action, excitement, tension and of course, a bad ass predator. The effects are great, the acting is good and the music and sound effects in this are pretty much the same from the original so huzzah! You will probably disagree with me but this has a slight edge over Predator 1 and Aliens. It definitely beats the crap out of the rather disappointing Alien Vs Predator. Watch Predator 1 and 2 instead even though if you are a fan of either aliens or predator then nothing and no one will stop you from watching AVP. Regardless of AVP's lack of quality Predator 2 is amazing so i'm giving it 10/10",Predator 2
171,RoboRabbit89,Predator 2 is a damn good time. Very Underrated sequel.,8,4 October 2018,"This film has a weird history: some love it, some hated it but
in all seriousness this IS a good sequel, especially with expanding the
Predator universe (AVP and AVP-R) and the various video games/comics.The sequel is set around ten years after the first film (I'm assuming it's
set sometime in the near future because theirs futuristic highlights throughout
the city. I'm including the original Predator as well).
Set in Los Angeles during a summer heat wave we meet Det. Harrigan 
(Danny Glover from Lethal Weapon) in the heat of a shoot out and his
team are battling a gang war against Colombians and the Jamaicans.
And in similar fashion Harrigan's team mates are killed off one by one
including gang members by another Predator, however Harrigan has an edge, he knows what he's up against because finds clues that the Predator leaves behind,
leading him to learn the skinned bodies and odd tech is from a creature not
of this earth.
With the not so help from a government group led by Agent Keys(Gary Busey)
Harrigan has the added advantage of battling the Predator, disrupting it's
invisibility tech and finally avenging the deaths of his team!I love Predator 2 very underrated, it's as good as the first.
Now most people will argue that Arnold was not in it but
Danny Glover is another icon of the 80's and he carries the film with ease.
The real reason Arnold was not in this is because he committed to do
(Total Recall and Terminator 2: Judgement Day) so there you go.Overall, a fun and enjoyable sequel to the first.
I give it an 8/10. Please if you want to see this 
definitely see it, it's as good as the first, i mean it's different
but that is exactly why I like it. Highly recommend.",Predator 2
172,shakey_jake53,pretty decent sequel,8,1 February 2003,"A lot of people give this movie a bad rap but it was not that bad.  Sure the dialogue is not very interesting in some parts and you dont learn much about the characters, but the action scenes are good and seeing inside the Predators spaceship was cool.  The film, I think, is amazing from the subway scene until the end, since its mostly cool action scenes, and Gary Busey's explanation of the Predator is good. Also, the shootout with the Jamaicans is cool.  If your looking for a movie where you dont need to pay attention to dialogue or characterization and just want to see action, this is the one to rent.",Predator 2
173,Exiled_Universe,Somewhat interesting yet somewhat entertaining,6,6 June 2019,"Ok, i dont really know weather this movie was better of worse the the first. I mean it still barely had the predator in the whole entire movie until the end. And even those 2 second shots of predator that you get are mostly him invisible and its getting really boring seeing him that way. Also, this movie has WAY too much infrared vision. I mean it has it almost in every scene of him just stalking people and it gets tiring very fast. The first was bad but not this bad. The acting could have been better and there was no gore whatsoever. This movie could have had so much more to it than this and that goes for the first one as well. I mean at some times it can be generally entertaining. It feels like an 80's movie with all these unnecessary gunfights in the beginning. The movie is BEYOND a snails pace in progressing in the story. I mean it was 1990 exact so if it was in mid or late 90's then it probably would have been at tad better. I dont entirely hate this movie, like i said, at some points it is cool and fun to watch. ANOTHER THING, HOW IN THE HELL DOES PREDATOR TALK. He's a freaking alien but i mean aliens can do anything really. A one time watch for sure and also for you too.",Predator 2
174,KillerLord,Worth Watching...,6,27 September 2008,"If you can look at this movie as a stand-alone movie, which it is not, then one may perhaps have some appreciation for some of the aspects of the movie. But this movie is meant to be a sequel to the original Predator that starred Arnold Schwargenneger. As a sequel, I would brand it as one of those sequels that essentially have nothing new to offer but are their predecessors done in a different way. In the original Predator, we have Arnold and his team of commandos venturing into the jungle hoping to find some human enemies to deal with and later realize that what they are facing is out of this world.The battleground was the jungle and the match was between Arnold and Predator. The sequel has not much new to offer. All it does is change the battleground to the city and this time a city cop played by Glover has taken up the task of hunting the hunter namely the Predator. There was some decently done shots in this movie, some battles that will not fail to keep the action-genre fans happy. But all-in-all there are unnecessary vulgarities in the movie. There are obscene dialogs and more brutal deaths and dead bodies. It seems like they have been added to make the movie more spicy.What is interesting is the ending scene of the movie. Glover has won the battle and to his horror, he sees more of them come towards him. But all they do is pick the dead body of their fellow Predator and take him away. One of the Predators nods in Glover's direction and hands him a gun. The gun is very old. One interpretation of this scene could be that the Predator meant to tell him that they have been around for a very long time and have been hunting humans as a personal sport or a hobby. This leaves you with unanswered questions. The movie could have dwelled more about the history of Predators rather than just give a lame hint in the end that their history was not a short one.The movie could have taken off in a more creative direction perhaps explaining the purpose, origin and history of these creatures. Instead the movie chooses to be a pure action flick packed with a lot of kills, explosions and reel type action. From this point of view, the movie is entertaining though not much new material can be found here. Overall, a movie worth watching though could have been done in a better way.",Predator 2

176,DorianWynHowells,Good film. Good sequel. Contradiction?,8,9 January 2002,"Moving from the jungle - or what's left of it! - the action shifts to L.A. in this sequel to the 'Predator'. As the tag line reads - ""He's in town with a few days to kill"", and that is what the Predator does best.THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE SO BEWARE - '**' INDICATES A HUGE SPOILER!As the story is set in L.A. during a massive drugs war, the alien has loads of fun killing many, many, victims. We must remember that he visits Earth (and many other planets) for sport. He is here to prove himself in some ways. He is here for...trophies.This film is very clever. In the first film, the Predator was a new species that we were absolutely terrified of - he was the enemy. We wanted Arnie to win at the end. In this film, our loyalties change from time to time. It all depends on who the alien kills. ** When we see him massacre an entire gang of cocaine snorting villains, we are secretly smiling and wishing them dead, because that's what the police want. But when the 'good guys' get targeted, we despise the Predator. Very clever how it plays on our emotions.Danny Glover puts in a 'Lethal Weapon' style performance as his tough, shoot first ask questions later character Mike Harrigan. He and his team think that there is a vigilante on the loose doing the work for the police, little do they know that there's an alien among them, watching mostly every move they make!** Gary Busey, the moment we see him, we know he's not all he seems, and it turns out that the government and Busey himself know of the Predator's existence. They have been studying him, they know why he comes to Earth to kill, and when. He comes for the thrill of the hunt, and especially when it's a warm climate, and there are constant references to the heat in this film!****** Poor old Bill Paxton - will he ever survive a film!! He dies in 'Aliens' as a hero, and here he also dies bravely. Much humour comes from his character, and it was a shame to lose him, but hey, when the hero needs a good reason to off the villain, let the villain kill someone on the hero's side!! Twice!!Many sequences in this film are directed well. The opening shoot-out. The subway scene. The meat factory scene. All great tension builders.We learn far more about the alien in this film. We are even taken to their spaceship, which is a great work of engineering!The pace of the film is good, only letting up for emotional reasons, and the blood and explosions just keep on coming! The first films are always the best (apart from a select few sequels - Godfather 2, Aliens) but this doesn't fail to impress, it is a worthy sequel, and one that seems to have been carefully planned.There has been much speculation of a 3rd installment to the series, but if it's anything like the Alien Legacy, better leave it there really. Much talk surrounds the possible Alien Vs. Predator film - now that is one I would really like to see!!!But this is still worth 8/10.

Glover is brill as the main head honcho, with Bill Paxton once again doing the manic role he seems to love... also has a great ending. Not getting well received on IMDb, but then again, they know nothing about some of the films as far as I'm concerned...

I love the first Predator movie and the franchise it launched, but this one expanded that franchise by showing us an environment that maybe we didn't expect or anticipated and by showing us variations on the Predator itself. It also establish the government agency OWLF as a force chasing after predators which forever it was part of the universe in comics and books and so on ever after. This one has a lot to offer if you take it for what it is and forget the fact that it doesn't have Arnold. Danny Glover gives a dynamic performance And he has a great supporting cast around him.

181,underfire35,The Predator Moves To A Lakefront Apartment.............,4,17 July 2005,"After the success of the original PREDATOR in 1987, a sequel was bound to show up sooner or later. In 1990, PREDATOR 2 hit the movie screen to lackluster response. As with most sequels, it failed to capture, or duplicate convincingly, what had made the first film so popular. The first PREDATOR was a violent, well produced action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as the leader of a band of army commandos who are hunted by an alien creature in a South American jungle. The film remains a holdover from my formative adolescent years and I have come to appreciate it as a tight, suspenseful action thriller with inspired makeup design by Stan Winston. Well, in the sequel (as the tagline would suggest), the scene has changed from the actual jungle to the ""urban jungle"" of L.A. Where, during a heatwave, the city is beset upon by another malevolent visitor from beyond the stars. The hero this time is the tough L.A. cop (is there any other kind?) Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover). He is surrounded by mainly disposable characters who are designed to be threatened or avenged: Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso), Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton, still in his screeching whine period; see also ALIENS), as well as various captains (Kent McCord, Robert Davi) who repeatedly tell Harrigan he is a ""loose cannon"" or that he is ""officially off the case"", etc. There is also a subplot involving a gang war between the Colombians and the Jamaicans, the turmoil being covered by a tabloid journalist (Morton Downey Jr. [!]) who adds bits of editorial insight into the various happenings. Adding to the cluttered attic that is the plot of PREDATOR 2 is a group of military researchers, lead by Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), who are out to capture and study the Predator; it is through them that Harrigan gains a more formative knowledge of what he is dealing with.PREDATOR 2 is one of of those sequels that fleshes out the ""mythology"" of an enigmatic concept. We get insight on what the creature eats, various medical gadgets it uses, a brief glimpse at a ""trophy case"", and lengthy conversations on numerous behavioral patterns. In PREDATOR 2, we learn, for example, the actual ""physics"" of the creature's cloaking device, which is great trivia, but much of the mystery is explained away. The result of all these explanations is that the Predator becomes mundane, a bit of a bore. In the preceding film, many of these questions are left unanswered or implied, focusing on the tension and isolation of the events. Gone also is the juxtaposition of the original storyline: the soldiers are professional killers who encounter something that is even more dangerous than themselves. They are not heroic in any real sense, but highly skilled men on which the tables have been turned. In PREDATOR 2 we get the more straightforward good cop versus the evil alien scenario which is not as satisfying. Black and white is not as interesting, to me anyway, as the varied shades of gray that the original film created.The fact that PREDATOR 2 has many well produced action sequences, but very little character development, should come as no surprise considering that it is directed by Stephen Hopkins (LOST IN SPACE, JUDGMENT NIGHT, BLOWN AWAY, THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS). The first PREDATOR did not exactly have the most dynamic characters, but John McTiernan, and his actors, did much with narrative shorthand in creating a functional situation in which the viewer was, at least, concerned about the ultimate outcome of the commando's plight. In the sequel, however, the cast is mainly B-list, and those who aren't are wasted. Danny Glover steps into the lead role, but seems out of place as an action film tough guy (his character in the LETHAL WEAPON series, the closest comparison, had much more nuance). I would guess he was cast to lend some credibility to what is, in essence, an attempt to produce the same financial return as the original. It would also seem that the filmmakers expected a veteran actor like Glover to carry much of the human drama of PREDATOR 2 without much help from the supporting cast. Not to be overly critical here, the film does have some good points: Hopkins has a flare for explosions (forgive the pun) and gunfights and PREDATOR 2 is fun to watch for those reasons. Alan Silvestri returns as composer, adding layers of aggressive rhythm to his themes from the first film. The film looks good and the production design, particularly the interior of the Predator's ship, is impressive. I can't really say that I like PREDATOR 2, but it has enough action and goofy sequences (the scene in the subway were every passenger carries a gun for example) to make it a mildly entertaining guilty pleasure. 4/10",Predator 2
182,badfeelinganger,One of the most inventive and underrated of all action movies: 'Predator 2',10,16 September 2014,"A gritty, entertaining, and action-packed follow up. Long, long, long underrated Predator 2 seems to be finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves.it looks like pure gold to those miserable cynics who disregarded it when it first came out because Arnie wasn't in it.Fans of Alan Silvestris score of the first film can take comfort in the fact that all of his cool themes are back - they were rudely ditched from AvP - and more evolved. It's probably the most engaging score he's done. His Latin drums, sinister Hermannesue strings, haunting urban sound effects and occultist voodoo chants dominate every scene and give each one its own unique voice.Everything from set-design and cinematography to sound-design and film editing is nothing short of brilliant. If you think I'm overreacting just watch the film and see for yourself. There's nothing mass-produced, or conveyor-belt, about Predator 2. Twentieth Century Fox chucked loads of money at it to make it the most sophisticated sequel it could be. Everyone involved seems to have made a huge effort and done their absolute best.Sure, we all love Arnie but, with his bulging biceps and brick-wall mentality, he's not the kind of screen icon your ordinary film-goer can really relate to. Danny Glover, on the other hand, is the common man personified: irritable, durable and beset by myriad woes. In an obvious nod to the recent success of 'Lethal Weapon', Glover is once again cast as a police lieutenant fighting a bloody battle with drug runners on the streets of LA. The twist is that now it's 1997, the drug lords are out of control and the streets of South Central have basically become one giant war zone. Plus there's a heat wave on. And then this bloody alien shows up,The rest of the cast are great, too, 'Predator 2' is more interested in character than how much a guy can bench, so here the muscles are replaced with mouths: Bill Paxton essays one of his most memorable roles as brash country cop Jerry 'The Lone Ranger' Lambert, Maria Conchita Alonso is perfect no-bullshit action-heroine fodder as Glover's partner Cantrell and Gary Busey performs his usual eye-rolling, wisecracking shtick to perfection as shady Special Agent Keyes, a role originally intended for Arnie's big comeback. Our gain.It's got great action sequences,The original was essentially an action spectacular with a spot of blood and a touch of sci-fi. 'Predator 2' is all over the place: is it a police procedural, a 'Robocop' style future satire, a science fiction thriller, a gangland drama, a black comedy, a monster movie? The answer is all of the above, plus everything the original was, leading to a fantastically unsettling sense of unpredictability, as a series of radical tonal shifts take the move from all-out action to gut-churning suspense in a heartbeat.Conceptually, PREDATOR 2 is the perfect sequel. It does not attempt to recreate the first film, but rather moves the setting to the next logical location: The concrete jungles of LA. The Thomas Brothers turn in another action-packed script that attempts to outdo the original at every turn. There is more blood, more violence, and more gadgets as this sleek new urban Predator sets out to collect his human trophies using metal shurikens, razorwire nets, and spears. The redesigned costume and differing attack patterns show us that the Predator race is as varied and diverse as our own, which leads up to a shocking finale aboard the Predator spacecraft. Danny Glover offers a welcomed change of pace from Arnold and the gang, playing a breakneck cop with no regard for authority. PREDATOR 2 comes as close as any sequel could to reproducing the thrills and non-stop action of the original, while giving us something new entirely.",Predator 2

184,Amityville15,"Silent, Invisible and Deadly. It's in town with a few days to kill...",5,12 July 2014,"This sequel to the 1987 hit film Predator unleashes the deadly Predator in another jungle - the urban jungle of Los Angeles. However the cops think that the mangled bodies that have been left at crime scenes have been put there by vicious gangs obsessed with voodoo. Instead, he finds himself confronting a savage alien who has come from a distant world to hunt humans for sport.This film starred: Danny Glover, Bill Paxton & Gary Busey.Predator 2 is no where as near as good as Predator, and in fact it's not a good film. This film is not enjoyable, it's slow and boring. In my film collection I had the Predator trilogy, now after watching this again, I only have the original because this film annoys me so much I have also lost interest in Predators (2010).

185,Hellrazr360,Grittier Setting Sets Odd Motions Towards Predator,10,13 February 2006,"Finding a typical sci-fi blockbuster that doesn't stand out much more than being mediocre isn't hard, anyone can find a DVD for any sci-fi movie at Blockbuster and find their rent disappointing. Predator 2 follows in this routine and doesn't come out as much more than a gritty sci-fi sequel to a superb predecessor. It's not that Predator 2 is necessarily a bad movie, it's actually fairly enjoyable. Yet Predator 2 isn't much more than what you'd get out of a typical movie purchase or rent. I did like how Predator 2 tries to be original in itself by having a gritty and urban setting however. There's also some great acting by Danny Glover who somehow manages to make the movie seem much more tense with his personality. But aside from that Predator 2 does nothing much to stand out as being a good movie. Yes, you do get to see the Predator kill and assassinate multiple victims in the movie for your viewing pleasure, but the producers have given the Predator a bit of a soft side, which just doesn't feel right after its predecessor. There will be those that think the twists that Predator 2 offered from the last Predator are great and make it an excellent sequel, others will be completely letdown by it as they'd expect much more after Predator. Next time you go to Blockbuster and want to watch a gritty urban sci-fi thriller Predator 2 might be worth your time, just don't take it too seriously.",Predator 2
186,amraampk,great experience,9,26 January 2010,"In 1st installment the creature landed into jungle ,in next it chose city in grip of chaos , L.A.

Its Dolby digital experience was very much great.I remember when the predator goes to hunt the local gang leader ,face to face , the sound his steps were making my seat shaken.

187,movieguy81007,Better Than The Original,10,27 August 2006,I think Predator 2 is better than the original. This was the first film to be rated NC-17. Danny Glover does a good job being Harrigan. The city is a better place to be than the jungle for the Predator. The action is good in this film. A long time ago I bought the original Predator thinking it was better than Predator 2 than a few years later I saw Predator 2 and I liked it better than the original. The Predator in Predator 2 is cooler than the one in the original. I also think the Predator's space ship is cool in this one. Also in the trophy room look for the head from Alien. I hope they come out with another sequel. No matter how many times I see this movie I never get tired of it.,Predator 2
188,eddie052010,Makes the first one look like Citizen Kane.,3,24 October 2014,"Movie sequels are films that usually have a poor reputation. Due to how the original film is well received (whether in popularity or in box office) and because of this has a lot of hype surrounding it, the sequel has a lot of weight to carry on it's shoulders, and because of this, is very disappointing when they often don't deliver. Sure, there are some exceptions here and there, but often movie sequels are often regarded unfavorably as they usually can't live up to the hype. This is definitely one of the prime examples of that. A bad story, bland characters, a lack of threat from the main villain and more helps this to become one of the worst sequels ever made, and makes the first film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.The story is that a decade after the original film, the Predator is on another hunting season, this time in a gang controlled Los Angeles, with many being killed off in the process. However, when a cop is murdered, his friend Lieutenant Mike Harrigan starts investigating trying to find his killer. Along the way he will have to deal with menacing drug kingpins and corrupt federal agents. The plot is one of the major problems of the film. Not only does it move at a significantly slower pace than the first film, but many of the multiple sub-plots it tries to establish (i.e. the corrupt federal agent, how his right-wing attitude towards certain crimes is being investigated) aren't interesting and often go nowhere, due to how either the characters in these sub-plots are killed off or how they are swiftly forgotten about after only a few scenes. It is hard to get invested in anything in the movie due to how not only is the plot very boring, but the characters are (with the exception of the main character) either very bland (e.g. Gary Busey's federal agent, the police captain) or pointless (e.g. Mike's female co-worker, Bill Paxton's comic relief sidekick who is clearly meant to be this film's version of Shane Black's Hawkins from the original). Not only that but by the end of the film, there are many loose ends that it doesn't tie or characters whose fates aren't revealed, and because of that you are left with a lot more questions than answers. That leads me to the biggest problem with the film: the Predator itself. Don't get me wrong, he is one of the best aliens ever put on film, and the first film did a very good job of establishing this, warts and all. However, this film doesn't do the creature justice at all, as the near-invincible hunter from the first film is reduced to little more than cannon fodder. Sure, Aliens did the same thing, but at least in that movie, the aliens were still hard to kill cannon fodder, to the point where most of the marine characters die because of it. Here, the Predator is killed by a average-built cop, quite easily I should add. This makes the Predator much less of a threat than he was in the first film. Sure in the first film he is killed off, but Arnie barely managed to survive against him and it was by bare luck that he managed to triumph. It was also a fairer match in the first film as well, considering that Arnie was an experienced soldier with a bodybuilder frame, and it was more plausible how Arnie managed to succeed in that film because of it. Considering how Danny Glover's character is not only less well built than Arnie but is also a cop should have made the fight more challenging, however the fact that wins so easily reduces any sort of menace that the Predator had in the first film. It doesn't help that the Predator is barely in the film, as there are huge sections where the Predator is absent, focusing instead on it's boring story. This amount of restraint would be excusable if this were the first film in a franchise, but not in the sequel where we expect to see more of the main antagonist. This is worsened however when he does show up to kill, as it's a major disappointment, as his killing sprees are either not shown or shot quite badly, especially during his subway massacre where it's shot so dark, it's hard to see what's going on. Considering how the first film's writers and subsequent creators of the franchise are on board once again, it's baffling that they've reduced their creature's coolness and menace by not only giving him less screen time and making him less of a threat this time round. Amazing. The film also suffers from political problems as well. The film is very right wing, as it supports it's hero despite his Michael Winner- esque actions (e.g. disobeying orders, attacking federal agents) and is slightly racist as well, portraying all of its Jamaican characters as drug dealers which is made worse due to the way they speak and act. It's quite surprising no-one on production noticed this, and because of this, it's politics are very questionable at best and flat out disgusting at worst.All of these problems make Predator 2 one of the worst sequels ever made. From it's poor storytelling, weak character development, terrible use of the Predator to its alarming politics, Predator 2 is a film that should be avoided like the plague, for not only being terrible on its own but a terrible sequel to a brilliant film. Sure the original is problematic, but the sequel is perfunctory in the extreme. Watch the original, as you'll get more from it than you will from this trash. Avoid at all costs. Watch the original and stick with that.",Predator 2
189,gabriel-80,Highly underrated,10,16 April 2016,"I don't know why Predator has such a bad reputation. I agree that the acting is somewhat wooden at places, BUT, and it is a big BUT; the overall feel of the movie is quite simply awesome. The action scenes are more than awesome. The expansion of the universe quite brilliant.There are so many memorable and quite iconic scenes in Predator 2, that still look amazing by todays standards (2016). The killing of King Willie, the train scene, the butchering of the drug lord by the Jamaicans, the slaughter house, the final mano e beast scene, the revelation right at the end and most importantly the excellent expansion of the universe. Extremely well done.Compared with Predator movies coming since 1990 the Predator in this one still feels invincible. Like a true force of nature. Not like the dumb ass, clumpsy predators in the extremely bad Predators.Unfortunately the guy in the suit, Kevin Peter Hall, is no longer with us. His other worldly moves inside the Predator latex simply can't be replicated, as evidenced by the extremely heavy handed Predators in the Predators movie.Two thumbs up! Great movie! Give it a shot! I actually think it is better than the first one.",Predator 2
190,eldergod-1,Bloody entertaining,8,9 February 2005,"The second part of the popular ""Predator"" series is better than the first, even without Arnold Swartzenegger (here Danny Glover is the main hero). The story, however is much more interesting. New Predator arrives on Earth, attacking L.A. and some of its dangerous inhabitants - gangsters from Colombia and Jamaica. The extra-torrential hunter has real fun with the stupid voodoo magicians and the narcobarons, but his prime target is a brave cop. So the cop must not only save L.A. from various bandits, but also survive in a battle with the unstoppable alien killer. ""Predator 2"" has no ambitions to be a great film and it isn't; however, it is highly enjoyable and entertaining. And the third movie (""Alien vs Predator"") is even better!",Predator 2
191,stewiefan201,Predator 2 has less interest in its title character. It's too much about the action.,4,29 December 2007,"Predator 2 stars the same alien type from the original film, but it's a different predator this time. The predator comes to Los Angeles to hunt down people, which basically consists only of drug dealers and cops. The cops are led by Lt. Mike Harrigan (Glover), a tough cop with a chip on his shoulder. His team is attempting to fight off Jamaican and Columbian drug dealers, all in the meanwhile the predator comes to town. The predator commences in killing drug dealers and skinning them without leaving a single trace. Harrigan and his team are stunned as to who is orchestrating these murders. Meanwhile a federal agent Peter Keyes (Busey) seems to possibly have more information as to what is going on. But sooner or later Harrigan and his team encounter this strange, violent creature, which leads to an all out war to stop it.Predator 2 contains very good special effects. The makeup effects make the Predator look stunningly realistic. And some of the sets are truly amazing looking. This sequel also begins to answer a few mysterious questions that fans of the original had.However these virtues don't really make Predator 2 a good movie. Danny Glover tries his hardest but the script is more into the action than the dialogue. Gary Busey I feel should have been the lead character. He was far more interesting than Glover's character, and in the end Busey's acting had more charisma. The clichés also arise in the form of annoying news reporters, a lead cop who's too into his job, and generic shootout action. The rest of the actors just kind of sit around with dialogue that makes them sound like idiots, and just leads most of them to their deaths. Bill Paxton's character Jerry Lambert for instance is very annoying and unlikable.I understand that most people will see this for its action, and that will more than likely entertain them. However it is not often that movies centered around action, forgetting good dialogue and characters, end up very good. While the original Predator movie added intrigue and mystery to to its title alien, this film ditches that for a few high pitch action sequences. Which while entertaining do not make up for the malfunctioning rest of the film. Also the Jamaican drug dealers never truly add anything to the story. I kept thinking they were hinting at the Predators being spiritual beings involved in voodoo or something. But no, as it turns out the drug dealers are there only for a bunch of bloody kills.The Predator is not as interesting in this sequel as he was in the first. The jungle was a better setting than the urban jungle of Los Angeles. The original Predator was more about the build up of tension, and the mystique of the creature's reason for being on Earth. Predator 2 is all about the violent bloody payoff which hurts the title character. There are very few significant answers to what these Predators are all about, and when the answers do appear there is still not much insight.Predator 2 suffers from bad dialogue and clichés. But mainly from a lack of interest in its title character, with the movie focusing more on the action. Special effects do not save a movie, sorry. I give Predator 2 a 1.5 out of 4. Go watch the first instead.",Predator 2
192,Stefan_Loves_Movies,Not what I expected it to be...,5,25 October 2021,"Predator 2 (1990) is a peculiar movie. The movie's biggest problem is the LOCATION. I feel like it doesn't suit the Predator franchise at all. The jungle from Predator (1987) makes more sense compared to the city from this movie. Despite Danny Glover's efforts to offer a compelling performance, I was hoping that the story would continue with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist. The plot is actually decent, maybe with a few adjustments, it could have turned out to be a pretty good movie.Tossing everything aside I feel like Predator 2 (1990) is a failed sequel.",Predator 2
193,jackcwelch23,Turn your brain off fun,7,5 September 2017,"Predator 2 lacks the suspense of the original. It makes up for it somewhat with pure action - shooting, explosions, slicing, dicing and heads ripped out of bodies. Going from Arnie to Danny Glover is an inevitable let down. I just didn't care as much about Roger Murtaugh tussling with a predator then I did the Terminator. It is very fast paced, which is both a plus and a flaw, as it never gets too boring but has no real tension leading up to the kills and is just keen to amp up the body count. Also has hammier acting and a sillier feel, mainly thanks to Gary Busey and Bill Paxton chewing that scenery real good. Has its moments, but not enough of them. One to watch when just in the mood for action and nothing else. If you want something truly exhilarating though watch the original.",Predator 2
194,vocklabruck,Garbage!,2,9 August 2007,"I didn't have any idea about the Predator 2 story. This film first came a long time ago and I had forgotten the hype. I watched it last night... so I was expecting something similar to Predator 1. Well, actually I didn't have high expectations since I found out that Danny Glover (?) had taken Arnie's place.My first disappointment came just at the beginning when the first shoot is over a kind of forest. The surprise was that after that forest you see high buildings and the overprint ""Los Angeles 1997"". I said ""WTF, Predator in the city???"" OK, I accepted the fact, but then I realized that Danny Glover was portraying about the 90% of the same character he portrayed in Lethal Weapon! In fact, at some point I started to ask ""When will Mel Gibson appear?"" Come on! Danny Glover being the tough guy who will defeat the Predator? Give me a break. What they were thinking? I don't have anything against Danny Glover but they couldn't find another actor or what? I still had hopes because I had seen Bill Paxton was in the cast. How stupid I was! His character was like the character he had in Aliens! But worse, because at least in Aliens he was a marine. Here his acting was OK, but well, I was expecting a good backup for Danny Glover or something like that, not an annoying cop. By the way, why Bill Paxton's bullets didn't do anything to the predator???And why latino gangs? Oh, yes. American films always with that racism. Before there were the blacks, then there were the latinos, now probably the gangs are semites.The film is full of implausible things. Where is the police, the army, the authorities? If you know there is an alien killing people in the city probably you would order an immediate evacuation! And how the predator came to the city? This is something never explained in the movie! And there is NOTHING in connection with the first one, just a brief mention of the events where only 2 people survived.I am not a die hard fan of Predator 1, but this sequel really stinks.",Predator 2
195,TheReviewMaster,The Last Great Predator,10,15 May 2015,"Although Predator 2 is basically the same story as the first film, I have always believed it lives up to the original on many levels, offering a different vibe and atmosphere, a different spin. When I watch the original, I watch it for its machismo, bravado, dirty dozen in the jungle vs. an alien hunter story. When I watch this sequel, I see a dark, Gothic, ghost story where the ghost is really an alien hunter able to camouflage and haunt its victims. I may be the only one who gets that vibe from this film, but the cemetery scene is what really dangled it in front of me.The whole subway scene is epic and brilliant in its own right, Danny Glover's character may not have the physical presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but he has the right type of attitude to keep me interested, and he surrounds himself with the most colourful characters living in the corrupt future city he fights crime (and an alien) in.Alan Silvestri's score is once again phenomenal, pumping, altering it just enough to give it a familiar yet fresh vibe. The new motif's he introduces are perfectly fitting, taking the jungle to the city.All in all a film I love just as much as the original (and to be honest, I think I may have watched this one more than the original).",Predator 2
196,Z21708,Good early 90s cheese!,8,29 July 2020,"Predator 2 was directed by Stephen Hopkins and was released in 1990. The film centers on an LA cop in 1997 (i.e. seven years after the film was released) in a near-dystopian future. The plot centers on a gang war while Los Angeles is hit with a gruelling heat wave, and a Predator is hunting these gangs while John Harrigan, a cop played by Danny Glover, is tracking down the creature.The effects were good for the time period this movie came out. I think the Predator costume looks fantastic, but the cloaking effect has not aged well. It looks really cheap by todays standards.The story itself is fine, it's excusable. If anything, you don't watch a movie like Predator 2 expecting Schindler's List, you just watch it to see a badass alien hunter hunt people.Overall, I really do like this movie. It's well directed and the acting is good as well. Definitely check it out if you haven't watched it yet.",Predator 2
197,Aphex97,A bittersweet taste...,6,10 June 2001,"...is left in mouth after viewing this movie. I absolutely love the original ""Predator"". This sequel, while offering some good action sequences, is just too bogged down with the cliched squabbling over jurisdiction by the local cops and federal officers (Not to mention, the police characters were silly and cliched to the point where I was shaking my head in disbelief).
However, the film shines when the creature is on screen. The monster is intrinsically fascinating. Watching him operate and hunt should be more the focus of the movie. We've all seen countless boring good cop/bad fed movies. With a premise as interesting as the Predator in the big city, one would think the writers would make the creature the star of the film instead of silly police politics. This movie lacks the correct focus.Final rating: 6/10. My mind reels with all these thoughts of wasted potential. Noob Aalox",Predator 2
198,Progressive-Element,A worthy sequel,8,24 May 2013,"Predator 2 takes us into a then-futuristic 1997 Los Angeles, a city that has become a war zone between Colombian and Jamaican drug gangs, with the police caught in the middle. Perfect hunting ground for another Predator.This Predator is a lot more macho than the one in the first, taking on whole gangs of people by himself. As a result, there is much less suspense involved, with the film delving a little into slasher movie territory with it's unstoppable killer, but the creature still makes for a most menacing foe. This one has even more hardware to play with.Arnie refused to star, but rather than go with another muscle-bound action hero, the film-makers went with a more workman-like hero, maverick cop Mike Harrigan played by Danny Glover. Danny makes for a likable hero, and proves more than up to the task of taking on the alien foe. Bill Paxton is amusing as the loudmouthed 'Lone Ranger', annoying at first, but you come to admire him. Maria Conchita Alonso is a heroine very much in the Vasquez mold. Gary Busey is cool as Keyes, a 'Fed' who clearly knows a lot more about what's going on that he's letting on. While antagonistic, it's difficult not to feel some sympathy when he tries to capture the Predator in an elaborate trap - one unfortunately the Predator can see right through.The film has a relentlessness characteristic of the best actioners, and throughout it's running time, it never slows down for a minute, even in talky scenes.The climax proves to be exhilarating, though it's here the film starts to 'borrow' a little too heavily from other movies. The sequence with Keyes trying to trap the alien has too much of a whiff of Aliens about it - not helped by an earlier scene that had a 'cameo' of sorts with a familiar-looking skull - while the rooftop battle smacks a bit of Blade Runner. The final showdown though is worth it, a one-on-one between Mike and the Predator that provides heart-in-mouth suspense.Not as good as the first film, but a far better sequel than could have been hoped for.",Predator 2
199,cmcastl,Superb sequel to Predator,10,10 March 2017,"Just watched Predator 2 again. Forgot how good it was.There is always the danger of the law of diminishing returns with sequels but not with this one. Danny Glover is a superb protagonist against the Predator. It was brave and right of the producers to let him, a black American, be the star. He carries the film marvellously. There aren't that many big budget films which will risk a black actor in the lead, even today.This a violent, often gory sci-fi thriller but it is a master-class in how a film of this genre should be done. Well-produced, scripted and acted. Excellent special effects for the time. The Predators really are ugly sons of *******, beautifully realised. All the supporting actors support to the full. It is, at the time of writing, sad to be reminded of how good the late, great Bill Paxton, God rest his soul, could be as a supporting actor. He cornered the market in being killed by aliens of one kind or another! This is a great sci-fi thriller but any great sci-fi thriller ought to harbour a philosophical moral or two. This one does. There was a time when human beings could only survive by being hunters, as well as gatherers, and I have no problem with that, at all. But when hunting becomes merely a Sunday or safari sport that is something with which I, as many like me, do have a problem. And these Predator aliens mirror this dilemma. You sense that with their superior technology they know the risk to them from their prey is usually minimal. It is good to see them get their come-uppence.IMHO The subsequent Alien versus Predator film was simply silly.",Predator 2
200,Cross18,just as good as the original,10,24 April 1999,"When I heard they were making a sequel to Predator.  I mean, the first one was so good I thought they would ruin it by making a sequel.  But let me tell you, I wasn't disapppointed.  Predator 2 is just as good as the original.  Danny Glover is at his best (Yes, I'm including the Lethal Weapon movies) as Mike Harrigan, an L.A. detective who's hot on the trail of our skull collecting alien baddy.  The special effects are awesome, the Predator looks great, and the action scenes are cool as hell.  I highly recommend Predator 2 to anybody looking for a good action movie.",Predator 2
201,Rayvyn,A sequel that is far better than the first film! Rare!,10,30 June 2002,"Rarely a sequel is better than the first movie in a series. Predator 2 is one of those rare times. In Predator 2, the acting, story line and action sequences are superior to Predator 1. Predator one was good and introduced us to the Predator. However Arnold's acting was a bit bad however the purpose of the first film was not to garner Arnold Schwarzenegger an Academy Award nomination. Danny Glover is a much better actor. The movie opens up with a scene of a jungle much like the one in Predator one. Then it shows that that jungle is right outside Los Angeles, a concrete jungle.  The second film also gave us a glimpse into the future. The future then was 1997. It showed how drug gangs ruled the cities and acted more like armed political factions than the traditional drug gangs. You have the police who are basically under siege and powerless against these drug gangs. Cops are out gunned and out numbered. Then we throw the Predator in the mix. I found myself cheering for the alien as he killed members of both drug gangs in pretty creative ways. Then comes Danny Glover's character LAPD Lieutenant Mike Harrigan. He's tough as nails and commands a unit of ""elite"" cops. The members of his unit are also great actors in their own right. There's Maria Conchita Olanzo, Ruben Blades and a young cocky Bill Paxton. Harrigan is targeted by the alien Predator after the Predator witnesses Harrigans heroic rescue of wounded cops in the opening fire fight. As the movie moves along we find out that as the Predator is hunting the Hispanic drug gang, the Jamacan drug gang and the police, a secret government group is hunting the Predator. The leader of this secret government group is well acted by Gary Busey. Busey and his group want to capture the alien and learn about it's technology. This makes for more people with guns the Alien can hunt. This makes the movie more complex. But it all boils down to the Predators desire to go one on one with Mike Harrigan. Then the Predator gets what he wants however the Predator becomes the prey and Harrigan the hunter. In the end we get a glimpse or the sense of honor the Predators have after Glover kills the Predator. The Predator's buddies actually respect Harrigan and give him a trophy for his kill.    I recommend watching both Predator movies. However if you want a more believable and complex story with better acting. Predator 2 is for you.Rayvyn",Predator 2

And far less macho posturing as well, making this film one of the very few movie sequals that manages to be better than the original.Danny Glover is very well cast in the role (albiet he seems to have laryngitus) and is supported well by Bill Paxton if not by Maria Alonso (Who still cannot act) Although we have a few hollywood sterotypes (the yardies, generic SA drug gang) everything fits in well here.The Predator of this movie is younger and brasher than the one in the first, eager to get trophies he feels are worthy of his alcove and quite happy to kill anyone else carrying a weapon in his presence.The chase scene and ending to this film were both very satisfying:(After following the predator out of the destroyed bathroom in the old folk's apartment: Harrigan: ""It's OK! I'm a Cop!!!"" Old lady: ""I don't think he gives a s**t"")The expanded Predator armoury was welcome as was a glimpse into a Starship/trophy room and a better idea of the honour code they follow.Basically, If you say Awesome!!/Kick A*s a lot, salivate over unfeasably large firearms and like watching guys with *ahem - ""Enhanced"" muscularity you will prefer the original.",Predator 2
205,guidomaschio,Underrated and overlooked sci-fi that I consider to be a cult movie,7,31 August 2002,"The first Predator was good, and this is as good as that was. When I watched it I was really pleased by the story, the action and the FX.This movie gives us a close look into the Predator world .. and this gives a special flavour to it.Really really enjoable; the only complaint is that Arnold is missing ... but Glover did a good job too.Vote 7/10",Predator 2
206,sunshinebeachcinema,"A creditable sequel, bringing together some favourite genres",8,2 September 2013,"The original Predator (1987) is a highly regarded classic '80s action flick with a sci-fi twist, and Predator 2 is a worthy sequel, expanding the Predator myth, throwing the titular antagonist into a new setting and delivering another slick action thriller. The backdrop is the urban jungle, dystopian future Los Angeles circa 1997, where the high crime rates of the early '90s have given way to open gang warfare, with the overstretched police department struggling to keep control. The city is suffering from the worst heat wave on record, another facet to the dystopia possibly projected from fears of climate change. Apparently, the Predator is drawn to ""heat and conflict"" and has come on safari.The lack of leading man Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as many other elements from the first film is something of a risk, but this allows Predator 2 to avoid becoming a tacked-on sequel; it is instead very much a standalone film. The only returning cast member is the 7'2"" Kevin Peter Hall portraying the titular Predator. The new star is Danny Glover, fresh from Lethal Weapon fame, as maverick cop Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.Worn down by the attrition of a demanding environment, Glover's character is a tough, but aging man, in contrast to the one-liner spouting, superhuman Schwarzenegger. Of course, this is why we loved Schwarzenegger, and why he is the perfect choice to go head to head with such a savage alien beast. Nevertheless, Lieutenant Harrigan provides a different kind of grizzled humanity. Unlike Schwarzenegger's former Green Beret, Harrigan is a cop, not a soldier. He is a man who knows what he needs to do, and the conviction to persevere against all the odds, even if he is starting to become slightly less confident in his own abilities.For a film that takes the saga in so many different directions, Predator 2 remains faithful to the series with plenty of parallels and call- backs. In both the first two Predator films, Our human hero goes on the hunt with a team of close friends and allies; before long, they become the hunted and are picked off as the film continues, leaving the last man alone to survive a few rounds with the Predator in a battle of wits and strength. The technology is consistent: the Predator comes packing his three-dot scope laser, infrared vision and explosive countdown timer. But he also showcases his medical kit and trophy cleaning equipment (a lot more grotesque than it sounds when said trophy is a victim's skull).The Predator is once more instilled with the alien sense of honour seen in the last film. The hunting tactics are expanded, we watch in horror as the Predator collects trophies: the cleansed skulls of his prey, and notice as he seeks out and values the challenge of a leader (from drug kingpin ""King"" Willie, to Harrigan himself). While brutal, he refrains from harming the unarmed or the vulnerable, including the pregnant detective Leona.The first part of the film plays out like a classic cop movie, albeit one with a dystopian flair, and higher stakes from the start. After an intense opening shootout, Harrigan enters the building where a gang are holed up, only to find their targets have been ritualistically slaughtered. Before long, Harrigan and his team are investigating a series of similarly brutal gangland killings, but are thwarted at every turn. Much to Harrigan's chagrin, an FBI team led by Special Agent Keyes (Gary Busey) begins to muscle in on his jurisdiction and stop him working the case. Clearly, not everything is what it seems. Busey's performance is typically eccentric, frequently garnished with generous helpings of ham as he quotes from the Wizard of Oz, once Harrigan's persistence wins through and Keyes starts spilling the beans. A new director takes the reins for this sequel. John McTiernan, who went on to direct Die Hard (1988) was replaced by the relatively unknown Stephen Hopkins. He relies perhaps on a tried and tested action-movie style, but a lot of thought is given to the pacing, which is intense, and barely lets up throughout. In fact, once the Predator's decimation of the FBI task force ups the ante, the remaining screen time is devoted to Harrigan's pursuit and combat with the Predator. Yet despite this, it is not exhausting in its intensity, and remains entertaining.Effective use is made of point of view shots, as the Predator watches his prey from various vantage points above the action. We can be sure it is him, and not just misdirection by the use of the infrared scope he uses to see. The Predator is then unseen as shots swoop around the urban rooftops. Often, all we see is the shimmering haze of the Predator's camouflage device, which is frequently misidentified as just another hazy shimmer in the sweltering Los Angeles heat wave – until, of course, it is too late. A suitably disorienting strobe effect is used in a memorable scene on the subway, when a whole host of armed thugs and civilians become easy pickings for the beast.Much of the film is not so subtle, the cops are rebels, the gang members are stereotypical, and the language through back and forth in anger and desperation is frequently crude. There is relentless wall to wall violence that could be deemed excessive by the faint hearted, but I think this is par for the course in any film that tries to do justice to an alien warrior who hunts humans for his sport. We are again left with the sense that any victory against such a Predator is little more than Pyrrhic.It's hard not to enjoy Predator 2. A creditable sequel, it brings together some favourite genres, from the procedural police story, through the mystery of an unseen killer, to the science fiction of the hunter from another world, into a solidly entertaining action film.",Predator 2
207,dpg-87522,A Greedy Movie,4,2 June 2020,"""Predator 2"" (1990) came 3 years after the original, and it didn't surprise people much when it was released, technically this second installment was a failure.
""Predator 2"" locates us in Los Angeles where a new predator begins hunting the people who inhabit the place, and this time the star is not Schwarzenegger because he wisely preferred to do ""Terminator 2"", this time the star is the gun cop deadly Danny Glover, so he and his friends prevented this beast from stopping before it hunts them all.
Technically it's the same plot from the first movie, in fact they blatantly use the same formula, that the main star survives alongside the girl, but not without first killing the predator.
Stephen Hopkins (The director of the film) fails to do a good job, although the action sequences are fine, the direction can be said to be not bad, but the special effects fail to be better than those of the first, the The way in which the film tells its plot is very simplistic and the only performance that I consider extremely acceptable would be that of Danny Glover, the others note that they were not very enthusiastic about being in this movie.
Something good that I have to say is that I like that they explored the character of Predator more, now you know that he has codes of honor that consist of not killing children, that there is no killing pregnant women and also not killing unarmed people, also that their species They are a series of hunting fans, they are on the ground because they like to hunt, but here a problem arises, if we consult a dictionary you will read that the definition of predator is:""An individual of an animal species (the predator or predator) hunts another individual (the prey) for subsistence.""
So the reality is that we realize that the title of the film is wrong, predators hunt because as I said, they are hunting fans, not because they need it to survive, therefore, the film should be called "" Hunters ""or something like that, but realistically, I think they named it the way they put it, because it sounded more attractive. Or maybe I'm thinking too much about things.
One of the big mistakes of the film is that when trying to be intense, it manages to be ridiculous or silly, an example is when Danny empties a shotgun magazine from the predator, once he is lying down, he removes the mask then we see his face and it feels the moment of how the film tries to make you nervous about what is going to happen, but it does not succeed, that scene is silly, I at least if it were, the moment to see the predator lying down without thinking twice I empty another charger to make sure he is dead, but no, he stares at him almost waiting for this other to wake up, and surprise! It is exactly what happens.
One of the main problems I had with the first is the forced execution that the main protagonist does not die, as I said at the beginning, this second installment does not die either, what I cannot understand is why? If the predator did not have one, but many opportunities to kill him, but for reasons unknown to us, this one did not do it, and it is exactly that, which removes emotion from much of the film, you know that whatever happens the protagonist will win , even though the predator beats him in every way, one might have believed that the scene where all the predators appeared to Danny, they were going to kill him, for killing his partner, but no, no Why kill? I don't know, they even reward him! Why? Again I do not know, if any fan of ""Predator"" is reading this and knows the reason for the above, I ask you to illuminate my ignorance, please.
And since it's classic for these kinds of movies, they may have those kinds of questions that don't have an accurate answer or just don't have an answer, for example, why in the opening scene of the shooting, there were no snipers? If it was a dangerous shootout between narcos that was destroying everything, or what was the need to subway a scene of two people having sex? If it doesn't contribute absolutely anything to the film, then there is a scene where we are shown the city police station and I wonder how is it possible that a police station is in the state in which I show it to you? It's a police station not a market, why the hell did the predator kill Danny's partner if technically he wasn't armed? Although he had his weapon holstered, but he was not using it, and they did not intend to.
But well, in conclusion ""Predator 2"" is one of those greedy attempts to exploit a product from the point of view that no one is interested in, either because it feels unnecessary in a certain way, its quality level is lower than that of the first, but it may be able to entertain you because of its entertaining action or because you feel interested in knowing more about the predator.",Predator 2
208,ShadySovereign,Predator will never be the same after this...,2,14 April 2006,"As a loyal fan to the first Predator movie, I was really expecting more out of the sequel (Predator 2) which was released in 1990. Although there are more things learned about the monstrous Predator species in the sequel, there are so many downsides that disappointed me, and many unnecessary additions to the Predator saga.The story takes place in 1997 in Los Angeles, where the once-starry-eyed city is now a zone of local gang warfare. Amidst the gang wars, something is causing brutal killings in various parts of LA. A tough detective (Danny Glover) sets out to see who is behind these gruesome murders, while a secret agent (Gary Busey) has his own plans for the mysterious killer...The main problem with this film is that it's less realistic than the first one. I wouldn't believe that Los Angeles would be so dark & dank in 1997. The police couldn't have been weaker than the ridiculous gangs in the city. And furthermore, Danny Glover doesn't look tough enough to face the Predator (he should have stayed in the Lethal Weapon films). All these points are an insult to fans of the first film.Another problem is the fact that Xenomorphs (from the film ""Aliens"") were actually linked to the Predators. In the film, a Xenomorph skull was shown in the Predator's trophy room in its spacecraft, which means that Predators have hunted the creatures before. If the stupid film-makers didn't put that damn Alien skull in the movie, the link between Aliens and Predators wouldn't have existed. Furthermore, there wouldn't be any trashy sci-fi films and video games that linked the two franchises together (such as the film AVP and the Aliens vs. Predator video games). Sadly, this link has been established and nothing can be done about it.Finally, the Predator in this film was extremely weak. Unlike the frighteningly powerful Predator in the original film, this Predator is pretty much a novice. It actually gets beaten by a puny little police officer. Its attempts at scaring audiences are absent, as this Predator spouts ridiculous one-liners. Its makeup effects look terribly fake when compared to the first movie; it looked more funny than scary. Worst of all, it is hard to believe that this naive Predator would hunt in a city. Who cares if the weather is hot there?! Would a Predator go hunt in the Sahara desert then? NO! There ARE a few good things about this movie. Gary Busey's performance was great; he was arguably the most memorable character in the movie. There are some impressive areas where the Predator attacks people, such as in the meat factory. But those are the only good things about this mediocre sequel.To sum up, this movie is definitely NOT for faithful fans of the original film. Only hardcore fans would like this film, and action-movie fans would like it too. But to others, this movie will remain a disgrace to the Predator franchise.I give this movie a 2/10.",Predator 2
209,pronins,Why such a low rating?...,8,24 July 2020,"Having rewatched all of the Predator films recently, I must say this is a very good film, still. Obviously the first film was a classic, but Predator 2 is an interesting take on the original, placing the creature in the city, instead of the jungle. The acting of the supporting cast isn't great, but Danny Glover is very good and delivers a more relatable, ""human"" protagonist character than the superhuman-looking Schwarzenegger. There are many fun action scenes throughout. A very enjoyable film worth watching.",Predator 2
210,angie-27,just as good as the original,10,4 April 1999,"Now, Predator 2 has taken a lot of flak from Pred fans, all of them saying that it's not half as good as the original, but I disagree.  Predator 1 was an awesome movie, and Predator 2 is just as exciting.  Danny Glover is good as an L.A. cop tracking down the predator.  The creature looks even cooler than the one in the first one, and the special effects and action scenes are way more intense.  Predator 2 is one of the best movies ever made.",Predator 2
211,adudewhoiscool,Pointless but entertaining sequel,6,22 December 2006,"""Predator 2"" is an entertaining movie. Unfortunately, it was not to the level of the first ""Predator,"" but that was expected because most sequels are worst then the previous movie. You will enjoy this film more if you had not seen the first one. If you had seen the first one, you should still enjoy this but not as much as the other. Nonetheless, ""Predator 2"" is a pointless but entertaining sequel.""Predator 2"" takes place ten years, 1997, after the first ""Predator."" Lt. Harrigan (Danny Glover) is a cop fighting the good war against drugs. Unfortunately, the major drug lords have been killed in a very brutal fashion. Harrigan's superiors tell him to stay out of it, but he knows something is wrong. His instincts are right when he discovers the person behind the murders is none other than the Predator, a human-hunting alien who likes to make trophies out of his victims' skulls. Can Harrigan stop the Predator? The biggest problem with this movie is its silly premise. The first ""Predator"" was fun with a Predator in the jungle stalking his prey. This one involves the Predator stalking its prey in the city of Los Angeles. Some people may enjoy this factor, but this reviewer was not one of them. It is much more exciting in the jungle of Central America. Arnold Schwarzenegger also rejected the opportunity to reprise his role as Dutch because he thought the premise was too ridiculous. You should not blame him because if you had read the script, you would have probably turned it down too.A minor problem is Danny Glover. As everyone should know, Danny Glover is no Arnold Schwarzenegger. In addition, as everyone should think, it is a lot less fun thinking of Danny Glover kicking a Predator's butt then it is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny Glover was not bad, but he just does not have that instant coolness that Arnold has. It would have been more entertaining if ""The Governator,"" aka Arnold Schwarzenegger, was in ""Predator 2"" instead.There are some positives though. Many of these positives were improved from the previous ""Predator."" The special effects were an improvement from the first ""Predator."" The action, the violence, and the gore factor are also improved from the previous film. The way they expanded on the Predator by giving him more gadgets and weapons was very interesting. Bill Paxton is always enjoyable in his supporting roles.Overall, this is a decent film. This is not anything worthy of owning, but it is still entertaining. This would have been better if three things happened: the first reason would be if the first did not exist, the second would be if you had never seen the first one, and the third would have been if you had seen the first one but were not comparing the two. This reviewer made a comparison to the first and that was his mistake. If you had not seen this film in a while, or would like to see it, you should rent it because it is still entertaining.",Predator 2
212,parkerchristman,Kinda 'Eh',7,21 May 2019,"I found parts of the movie slow, parts that were like 'wtf!?'But there were some solid scenes. I definitely enjoyed Gary Busey.

213,jhall_moviereviews,Probably the best sequel to any movie ever made,10,5 September 2020,It's a classic. I loved the first one and loved this one. Danny glover hunting down a predator in the city streets of LA is badass. Just as good as the first if not better!!! I love movies like this from the 90s I used to rent this movie and the original monthly from blockbuster I loved it so much. No way in hell a 6.3 out of 10.,Predator 2
214,shortround8391,Very disappointing......,2,18 April 2009,"Yup, you heard me, a real disappointment, especially after how great the first ""Predator"" movie was. But of course, everyone could've seen this coming, because that's how sequels tend to be like; very, very pale in comparison to the original.This time we have the Predator not in the jungles of Central America, but now in the streets of Los Angeles that has become over-run with a gang war between the Jamaicans and the Columbians. Putting the Predator in the big city wasn't a terrible idea, because where else could you put him besides the jungle? But the thing is, it worked a whole lot better when he was in the jungle, because you could feel the deadly silence and the claustrophobic feel. But in a metropolis like LA, you're just gonna find yourself being distracted, and you can't focus enough on the Predator to be intimidated by it. And also, the film spends over 20 minutes trying to hide the Predator behind its camouflage, question is, why? We've already seen the Predator before and we already know what it looks like, so the movie is basically wasting time trying to keep us guessing.But what really killed this movie for me was Danny Glover. And ""Predator 2"" did nothing for him except prove one fact; Glover can't play the bad@$$/maverick cop. Why? Because that's just not him, he's better off being the good cop who plays by the rules in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. He somewhat acts very awkward when he tries to be the tough guy, but that's just ruined by his stilted mannerisms and his good boy face. An the bottom line is, he's just not very convincing. And what makes it even worse, is that his character ""Mike Harrigan"" is totally shallow and not a lot is explained about him. For instance, who is Mike Harrigan? What are his motives for him being a maverick? Did he used to have a family? What were his past experiences like? Movie doesn't say. In the original ""Predator"", we knew who Dutch Schaeffer was, we knew he was an ex-combatant who got involved in too many battles and he's seen a lot of death happen. And that's when he decided to tone himself down and become a rescuer and not an assassin.And also the supporting cast is way outta the league of the one in the first movie. The special forces team members were their own individual characters and we basically wanted to see a spin-off prequel for each of those characters. But in Predator 2, all we get is Bill Paxton being bought in to do what he does best; comic relief. But the jokes that tells are so out-of-place and awkward, and in a few small parts, you can tell that Paxton is just embarrassed to be there in front of the camera and spewing out those crappy lines.Gary Busey's performance is nothing special, and he basically just keeps the same expression throughout the whole way. And the idea of an NSA agent trying to capture an alien isn't even realistic.But one thing I liked about this one is that it revealed new facts about the Predator itself. It reveals that it follows a code and a law and the killings that it commits is just an act of sport. And it only kills those who are armed and it doesn't strike at a pregnant woman so it won't take away any innocent lives.But the action just doesn't interest you and the suspense is pretty much abysmal. Just watch this if you want to learn more about the alien and if you are a real die-hard fan of the first movie....even though you might be disappointed.",Predator 2
215,jremigio2001,A great film of Predator,7,26 May 2020,The first Predator was great I seen them all including Aliens vs Predator and Aliens vs Predator Reqiuem and Predators I so much love to see their home planet and all the Predators and the Predator King. I like this crossover it teases Aliens vs Predator and ties in Aliens and Aliens 3 into the story. Bishop from Aliens is Weyland in the year 2004. Arnold turned down come back to the sequel. In the first Predator he wanted an experienced director the creator set back as an actor. They got the idea in bringing Lethal Weapon actor Danny Glover to star in he gladly accepted. Nice to see some Lethal Weapon action blended into the Predator series.,Predator 2
216,Sargonarhes,This is one of my favorites,10,14 July 2000,"I saw this movie years ago, first day at the theater, and I still enjoy it a lot! First I will tell all the fools that want to compair this movie with the first one, DON'T! This movie must stand on it's own! What are the odds of another Predator hunting Dutch (Arnold) again? Too high of odds to make it believable! That was what made most movie like these too stupid the same people getting attacked by another one of those killers, give me a break, (you know, movies like alien, scream, friday the 13th. those kinds)",Predator 2
217,idontneedyourjunk,I'd rather have some candy,3,29 May 2018,"South Central LA seven years into the future has turned into even more of a cesspool than before. Luckily, there's angry/yelling-man Lieutenant Mike Harrigan to sort crap out.He's angry/yelling at the lack of backup while he's breaking protocols, he's angry/yelling at his captain while he's disobeying orders. he's angry/yelling at the CIA while breaking jurisdiction and getting his officers killed.This part was supposed to go to Schwarzenegger (who said no to the script and the director), so to compensate, Danny Glover did alot of steroids? No muscles, just the anger issues.Director Stephen Hopkins, hot off directing Nightmare On Elm Street 5 (the 2nd worst performing in the series), just gave the following direction:""Be angry. Like, you've just snorted a line that was cut with caffeine. Off your wife's back while she's screwing your boss. Here, hold still while I inject you with some more steroids. I just watched Born On The 4th Of July with Tom Cruise. You want to be good as Tom Cruise? Boy, that kid can run. You should run,too. Not fast, because you're too old for that crap. Just run angry. And can you yell a bit more?""So it's Predator 1 in the city instead of the jungle. Only we're starting from scratch again, so it's mostly everyone running around clueless about what is hunting them, and the predator is using the cloaking device, and it's a big reveal! Only you already knew it was a predator and you've seen them before.There's a minor subplot of drugwars, which is the Jamaicans vs Colombians that makes no sense and goes nowhere  everyone dies], but mostly it's a secret CIA group hunting the predators  they all die as well] with angry/yelling man getting in their way, until he chases one back to the spaceship, kills it, then gets a memento before they leave. End scene.As per usual, alot of the blame can be laid at the feet of the executives. They forced multiple rewrites to cut the budget. They refused to hire the same director because he wanted more money than what he got for the first Predator movie (he had just finished directing Die Hard). By this stage, Arnold pulled out because of the bad script and bad director (also, he wasn't offered enough money). Turnaround for the entire movie was 8 weeks (4 shooting, 4 editing) on a shoestring budget with an inexperienced director, who in his own words, said ""I'm pretty immature, really, so it was kind of a laugh"".The movie was only greenlit after the comic series were successful, which led directly to AVP, despite this awful mess.Starring:-Pretty much the SFX crew from the first movie, including the original costumes. The spear gets stolen at the end of shooting.-Tom Boyd, everybody's favorite oboe soloist, whom we haven't heard from since 'An Early Frost'.-About 5 dozen stuntmen who double as nearly every small part role. Seriously, you want small parts in big movies? Be a stuntman-Totally not too many chiefs with 8 producers-Hal Rayle, voice of the predator, was the voice of Raphael in the original TMNT TV series-Teri Wiegel, Playmate November '86 (not a stretch to have her having sex in this movie).

A Playboy co-worker suggested adult films, and the rest is history, with 88 adult movies-Elpidia Carrillo, Anna from the 1st movie, only one of two characters in more than one Predator movie. Her speaking part was cut, so she only has a background cameo in one scene. She is actually a serious actress in Hollywood and Mexico.-Kent McCord as Captain Pilgrim. Sounds like a poorly thought-out superhero. He had previous experience on the beat as Officer Jim Reed from Adam-12 (60/70s cop comedy/drama)-Adam Baldwin, whose one scene was to try and get angry/yelling man to not be so angry or yelling. No prizes for how that went-Robert Davi, His role as captain was to tell off angry/yelling man every time he broke multiple laws, but let him keep his badge. Starred in the 90s TV series ""Profiler""-Bill Paxton, as a smartass, wise-cracking glory-hunter with incredibly bad lines and complete lack of chemistry with fellow actors.

218,Kranadon65,Mess of a movie,4,5 October 2021,"Predator already let the cat out of the bag with the creepy scary unseen alien and it worked.The best part was the alien wasn't revealed until near the end of the movie .Now with Predator 2 much like every
other cash grab sequel that gets made when the first movie is a blockbuster - there is nothing new added - we already know who and what
the antagonist is so rather than try and do something different they simply just rehash the originals plot with the only difference being location . Another mistake is the miscasting of the hero -Danny Glover - he is totally wrong here and looks and acts much like his Lethal Weapon counterpart - overacting and hammy plus he does not have the body for an action hero-a bit scrawny. Almost as if they cast him just to be PC for a black actor. And don't even get me started on Gary Busey's phoning it in portrayal of a covert special ops type guy who's been tracking the predators and seem to know all about their recent activities by having all this intel from the mission that Schwarznegger and his crew went on in the previous movie . The action scenes are just a repeat of the predator killing and skinning people and hiding etc. The ending is ridiculous too when you think about how hard these creatures are to kill and Glover does it rather easily and when several other predators show up ,they dont kill him -the leader simply throws him a pistol from the year 1715 (showing that these creatures have been around hunting humans for centuries )and then leaves . Its like this stupid honor system where the predators respect Glover now that he' s in a sense become the hunter instead of the prey. 4/10 and that's generous.",Predator 2
219,jneiberger-1,"Just a really, really awful movie",3,16 September 2018,"I don't understand the love for this movie. Everything about it is awful. The story, dialogue, acting, directing, photography...all horrible.",Predator 2
220,lourensini,Teaching how Seconds are the Last of the Firsts.,3,22 February 2012,"Since we loved Schwarzenegger movies, and 87'predator is Frakking AMAZING, I must agree with the guys who says Predator 2 is a pile of junk. And I don't care how much famous Danny Glover is, because he's character in this movie tryies to be so tough, that it becomes as funny as a Beverly Hills Cop. And when you look at his gun, all you can think is ""what da heck he's using? because is looks like a plastic pistol you can buy for your 8y old nephew.About the acting? That ain't no acting, just script lines being reading. And by this I mean: not even from Danny Glover. And the script itself doesn't help at all.Another thing, important as such is how are the scenes captured. In determined point of the movie, you'll see King Willie speaking in a dark alley with Mike Harrigan just like he were the most spooky persona on planet, and the way camera, script, and lights are mixed in this particular scene, they make him look like a stupid lunatic. He wasn't supposed to me stupid, just crazy. And this, my friends is just the beginning of a great fall.I can't understand how much morons soldiers and cops are created to be. Right in movie finals scenes, super soldiers show how much they have been trained for, by teaching the most stupidest things a soldier shouldn't do. I guess the cops and mafia goons from Leverage TV Show were probably inspired by Predator 2. No joke.This predator photography also sucks and doesn't help much along the story, actually, make it boring since the beginning because all of those shots taken from Predator Views. Except for a little bit of new predator dark, light, heat and something else visions. That's it.I've been telling about the bad stuff so far But two thing are interesting: Predator sense of prey and the final twist.

222,pitabox987,From the lush jungle to the urban jungle!,10,21 February 2020,"I probably enjoy the pacing of this movie considerably more than the original, don't get me wrong the original is a good movie as well, but I enjoyed the tempo of this movie more, I prefer the faster pacing and to be honest I find it more fun without Arnie; Danny Glover is just a regular (albeit excessive at times) cop and it shows us what happens when the predator messes with the wrong regular guy.Instead of tossing in a beefy he-man character like Arnold we get Danny Glover; showing us you don't need to be a muscular titan to stand up to the predator, regular guys can kick ass too, and also that the Predator isn't an invincible force, it can be hurt and is no stranger to pain, truly relying on stealth and deception as it's allies to get the best of it's opponents instead of simply going in all guns blazing, killing everyone in one shot with plasma weapons which honestly gets boring after a while.I also love that this movie delves more into the backstory of the Predator, we're shown that it doesn't just hunt humans exclusively, it also hunts other species; seeking the best from each world as trophies from throughout the galaxy for it's collection (humans included.) It also shows that Predators have a much longer history with Earth than the first movie ever implies, going back centuries (millennia in actuality).Say it's crap if you want, but you might be watching it from the wrong perspective; it's not a straight action movie like the first so don't expect that; it's more of a black comedy in places, and is well worth it!",Predator 2
223,Gorgorgorgoroth,Funny how people think this stupid franchise is connected to Alien all because of an EASTER EGG,1,20 March 2017,"Sooo... an alien hunter from God-knows-where travels to Earth to hunt gang members? A gang member's head is worth the hunt? It's funny how many times when the Predator was cloaked, people STILL saw it. Yeah, some ""advanced"" extraterrestrial that thing was, right? One thing I never understood was why was the Predator so interested in Danny Glover's character? Of all the characters, Danny Glover just happened to be the special snowflake to the Predator. The Predator stalks Danny Glover to the graveyard but doesn't attack him, so what was the Predator doing? In the beginning of the film, Danny sees the Predator (while it was cloaked. Yeah, some high tech that thing was, right?), the Predator is just staring at Danny, and the Predator jumps down. Umm... so why didn't the Predator try to kill Danny at that spot?The meathouse scene was ridiculous. The Predator is LITERALLY in the middle of guys with guns and everyone misses their shots. The Predator is right at their faces with that stupid looking spear and killing them. Those guys with guns couldn't kill an alien hunter that is OVER 2 METERS TALL and right at their faces... wtf! After Danny shoots the Predator and the Predator is knocked out, he takes off the Predator's mask and when the Predator wakes up, it grabs Danny's neck and throws him away. Why didn't the Predator just kill Danny at that spot? When the Predator throws its flying pizza cutter looking thing to Gary Busey, Gary's lower half body falls but where is his upper half? Stupid logic.The Predator tries to blow itself up all because Danny tackled it off a building. But Danny prevents the bomb by slicing off the Predator's arm and the Predator starts falling to an old woman's bathroom.You know, at this point, I think it's really funny how this Predator can't kill a cop, even when this Predator encountered Danny many times in this film.After the Predator treats its wounds and runs away, Danny follows it to its ship. Predator was running away from a cop? LOL! Aww, I guess a cop was too difficult for the Predator to kill, even though Danny at this point has no gun.At the end, Danny kills the Predator in hand to hand combat... wait a second, hand to hand? LMAO! And people think Predator is strong? Some old ass Predator shows up and gives Danny a gun from 1715 as a reward and the other Predators take the Predator's body. So according to this movie, when you kill a Predator, its leader will award you. If you belong to a clan where the leader would reward anyone who kills you, you might want to look for a better clan to join. You know, not only was this movie very stupid, but I think it's more stupid how retarded Predator fans think this franchise is connected to Alien franchise all because of a Xenomorph skull easter egg... EASTER EGG. EASTER EGG. EASTER EGG. They don't share the same universe, retards. Movies do easter eggs all the time, they don't mean anything. It was just a joke, the director said so if you watch the making of Predator 2. Are people really this dumb?Predators got killed by humans multiple times in hand to hand combat yet people think Predators can kill Alien? LOL! Arnold beat a Predator's ass by using sticks... STICKS LOL. If Predators are extremely strong then why the fvck do they hunt humans for sport? Predators are obviously not that strong compared to humans. Go ask Adrien Brody, he killed a Super Predator in hand to hand combat.Anyway, stupid movie, stupid plot, and stupid franchise. This franchise really needs to stop piggyback riding on the Alien franchise. It's getting old.",Predator 2
224,willsgb,LA dumbed down and action-movie'd up for a predator safari,5,27 May 2008,"The opening scene to this movie sets the subsequently maintained tone appropriately and somewhat absurdly; an anticipatory predator theme tune sweltering in the LA backdrop, as the now familiar heat vision pans across the city, which is quickly revealed to be in the midst of a city wide gang war between Colombian 'Scorpios' and the Jamaican 'voodoo posse'. and the dialogue actually gets tackier then that. in a street that looks like a primary school kid's idea of a ghetto, Colombians with weaponry that would make Dutch whimper with joy kill the hell out of the police, while a frenzied over the top news crew rants excitedly about the conflict, bullets flying past their ears. along comes the cavalry, in the hilarious form of Danny Glover, who looks like he has a hangover and a hernia, labouring around for the duration of the film with an expression of sheer exasperation on his face. he drives a car into the maelstrom, ignoring the likely possibility that a stray bullet, or perhaps grenade - which those silly coked up pendejos have already used to slow-mo blow up a police car - could kill the expletive out of hernia Harrigan right there and then. as it happens, his bravado gets his fallen colleagues out of no mans land, and the Scorpios retreat into a dilapidated factory to pack some more weapons and snort a mountain of beacon.the predator spies Harrigan's headstrong heroics, and we don't hear it but he probably gives himself a hernia of his own laughing his head off, before mopping up the Hispanics. that would also explain how the good lieutenant manages to obscenity him up in the end, with his own Frisbee (the weaponry the predator sports in this film is pretty cool though, quite a plethora). we find out that Harrigan also has a fear of heights, just to reinforce his manliness. we're introduced to a police station that looks more like a punk gig, and a bunch of characters that like to shout and look moody and self assured while engaging in dumbed down banter that makes me want to watch another film that doesn't kill my intelligence. Bill Paxton is the worst of these, trying to be a mixture of Hudson and Hawkins, and failing so embarrassingly that i only stopped cringing when the predator skewered him during that epileptic train scene.the sets are pretty tacky and contrived, however, more a surreal dumbed down OTT characterisation of LA then the real thing, as epitomised by the skunk-mobile king Willy's boys drive around, blazing a trail to Willy so hungover Harrigan can shudder at Willy's demon babble. then the funky rasta gets decapitated in a pretty cool face off, before the train scene. Busey and his cutout fed boys keep flitting in and out of the picture, ineptly arriving late to every butchering in their plastic helicopter and pissing Harrigan off. eventually, Harrigan's team decimated after a few encounters, the knocked up sassy and annoyingly accented crew-cut Leona spared, Keyes' fed team and Harrigan converge on the slaughterhouse, where the predator has been nailed on one of his feeding times - like the first film, the predator is worked out in order to be beatable. instead of enhancing the mystery the original otherwise promotes with some unexpected twists, it turns out to be little more then a strong, ugly dude with cool toys to kill the other boys, and a clockwork schedule that even the sheer idiots that populate this film can work out. all the same, it takes out the feds and Keyes pretty swiftly and scares the shizam out of hysterical Harrigan, which leads to a tag chase around a few buildings and finally though an elevator shaft to the predator ship.notice my skillful swear word dodging. sarcastically, of course, but for a reason; this is exactly what the film didn't do, instead indulging in character decisions and dialogue that makes British televisual 'drama' Eastenders look erudite, insightful and metaphorically rich. the predator is not expanded on either, because everyone, from the gangs to the press to the police to Keyes and his feds are complete idiots, and each fight with the predator reveals something new in the most patronisingly presentable way - oh look! it spares the pregnant. oh look! it has a net and a spear and a blade gun. oh look! it can see in every spectrum of light, as helpfully demonstrated by Keyes assuming it can't. very clumsily done and shamelessly tacky and plastic, much like everything else about the film; and a great shame, as there were good aspects to it and given a revamp in style, setting, dialogue, plot, score, cinematography - well, everything, it could have been challenging and a worthy sequel.let's not forget how similar the plot is to the original, and how it tries too hard to emulate everything the original does naturally and fails as a result; let's concentrate for a moment on the saving grace of the film, the final battle. the ship is interesting in design, and the gun given back and the revelation that they visit often and are many are tantalisingly revealed and enjoyably observed. Glover still seemingly has that pesky hernia at the end as his drags himself out of the tunnel to confront the cardboard cutout fed who tsks and frets because that nasty but usable alien got away. still, as Harrigan looks up and remarks 'you'll get another chance' the viewer eagerly enjoys an ending that slightly makes up for the rest of the generic 90's action movie mess, and offers the hope for superior, imaginative, exciting sequels to come.well, after 2 separate and unfortunately equally horrific match-ups against the aliens, a bunch of comics that pitted the predator against all manner of characters from Tarzan to Superman, a bunch of games and enough rumours to crash the internet, we're still waiting.OK pussyface, it's your move.",Predator 2

226,er-guille,"In one word, AWFUL",1,19 April 2008,"I just saw this movie for the first (and hopefully) last time. I like the actors here, Danny Glover, María Alonso, Ruben Blades, Gary Busey; but the script just couldn't get it. I mean, Glover is a great character actor, Ruben Blades can portrait his roles in a very believable way; but the script is sooooooo lame that no actor would have been able to make this piece of c.... take off. Besides, it looks like a fourth rate production, cheap effects, cheap photography, cheap edition. The characters all look phony, false, with the same depth as the paper the script was printed on. No story line to talk about. The story was no story at all. Just a collection of scenes with almost nothing to connect them through, besides the gore, the blood and the alien. Predictable as hell!!!. Not a single surprise in here. The first movie wasn't really great, but at least was enjoyable. This abortion of a movie does not deserve even a place in the Razzie awards. It's too bad even for that!. After seeing this so called movie, I found myself with a little problem. Now I don't really know which film gets my award for the worst movie ever. This or Fast and Furious. The choice is difficult. Don't loose your money buying or renting this. Don't even lose your time seeing it on cable!",Predator 2
227,Griever_2112,I think this is a good follow up.,8,20 August 2013,"We go from the jungle of Central America to the Concrete Jungle of Los Angeles. In a very violent ""future"" Los Angeles (the movie was filmed in 1990, but takes place in 1997) 2 major drug cartels have turned the city into a war zone. It's also during a massive heat wave. The perfect hunting environment for a certain alien hunter.The star of the movie is Danny Glover, fresh off Lethal Weapon 2. He played Lt. Mike Harrigan a veteran, and grizzled, Los Angeles police officer. He is similar to Dutch (Arnold's character from the first movie) in that he has rules and cares for his teammates.The movie starts off with a shoot out between cops and Columbian Drug Cartel. The cops are able to drive the bad guys into their hideout, and while those coke whore are reloading, something crashes through the ceiling and wipes them out... I think you know where this is going.The movie plays out differently then the first one, where during the course of the events it seems like the Predator takes a fixation on Danny Glover, first taking out the Columbian Cartel they were fighting, then a group of Jamaican Cartel members, but then it gets weird.The Predator goes back to where he killed the Jamaicans, and find Danny Glover's partner and takes him out. Now he was armed, but there was no conflict and his gun was only drawn in self defense really.I know the whole ""honor code of the Predators"" is from the comics and such, but the movies is what established that line of thought so I stick with that.Then the Predator stalks Danny Glover killing the head of the Jamaican Voodoo Posse right after he leaves, leaving part of his partners necklace in a cemetery.The climax is really neat with the audience getting too see a Predator ship, internal and external for the first time really. Plus multiple Predators at once too.Visually the movie was good. The story was solid, and different enough from the first to distinguish it.I would have marked this higher if they had done more connection to the first. For example, Gary Busey's character Keyes, he knows about the Predator from debriefing tapes that Dutch and Anya gave after the events of the first movie. But they were cut from the final production (not sure if ever filmed) but that would have been a great tie-in, and making the connection cleaner, at least for me.",Predator 2
228,vladthelad8666,Absolutely delightful sequel.,9,13 April 2020,"It's mind-blowing how many people seem to despise Predator 2, and I can't find a single reason why. Yes, it has a handful of goofy moments, that make certain moments in the movie a bit lighter, but none of them make it less serious or enjoyable to watch. None of the action has been stripped down and it's just as bloody and violent as the original, or even more as seen in a couple of scenes. The most successful thing ""Predator 2"" has going for itself, is the fact that it's completely different from the first movie in almost every aspect. This time the movie is set in another type of jungle - a concrete jungle. Los Angeles is torn between a war and a raging heat, which means hunting season is open. Even the design of the yautja warrior is new and fresh, and really suits the vibe of the city.The characters are also very different from the original, as then we had trained commandos, and now it's up to a couple of LAPD officers to solve the mystery, of who or what is killing all the gang members. Right from the start, it's very obvious that the character of Danny Glover (Michael Harrigan) is not like good old Arnie, he is a very headstrong man, who doesn't follow any orders, but cares about his fellow colleagues, and especially his team. They are also very well written, and have great chemistry between each other, which may be because Bill Paxton (yes, he is in this one as well) is just soo charismatic.A great little detail, that casual fans may miss, is that every predator behaves differently. The Jungle Hunter never went after the insurgents and observed quietly, while the City Hunter slaughtered the gang members, even though it wasn't necessarily for him to do so. Throughout the whole movie, he is shown to be more aggressive and maybe more impatient than his brother.The soundtrack by Alan Silvestri takes inspiration from the original movie, but still manages to stand on its own, and provide solid tunes for all the action-packed scenes.Personally, this is my favorite movie in the whole franchise. It greatly expands the lore of the alien hunters and doesn't shy away from new ideas, many of which work in favor of the movie, especially the scene on the predator's ship, where we even see the first ever crossover between the Alien and the Predator's universes. It's a movie every sci-fi fan should see, it's a great classic, that holds up really well, taking in considerations the things that come after this movie of course.",Predator 2
229,alangiruk,A Wasted Opportunity,3,18 March 2003,"I hope there is never a special edition release of this terrible sequel to the original. This is a non starter right from the beginning due to the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger.Danny Glover is a useless Arnold replacement. I have never been impressed with this bloke (not even in the Lethal Weapon films) and this film has done nothing to change my view. Watching him, one of the first thing you say is:
'There is no way this guy can take on the Predator'.Acting is just average and in some cases very poor (particularly  by Glover's three cop partners in the film). Granted, some scenes do stand out. Especially the bit where the Predator is fixing himself up after a duel with Glover. But that is about it.However much you like this film, you can't say it's a successful continuation of a prospering franchise. All it succeeded in doing was killing of the Predator series. Stick with the original.",Predator 2
230,johnnycage10,"Good dialogue, good action, great cast = great film",10,23 November 2004,"The title summarizes it well. Despite what the nay-sayers would have you believe, don't take their word for it. Predator 2 is every bit as wonderful as its great predecessor. I'm very surprised that people think that P1 was better than P2. Why? Because of the dialogue where Arnie goes 'We're not assassins, we're rescuers only' and people believing that BS? Please! My verdict  Both Predator films are outstanding. It's just too bad that idiot Paul Anderson was the one who was in charge of directing the pathetic attempt at a 3rd movie. But then again, this isn't the place to discuss the trauma that was Alien Vs Predator. The action in P2 starts fast and furious from the very beginning. The characters are emotionally charged, with Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Maria Alonso all giving good performances, with smaller characters, such as their captain and the police chief above him, still being decent characters who are played respectfully well by their actors. I suppose audiences nowadays want to see more of the stereotypical politician/idiot of a police captain and chief, and maybe they couldn't handle seeing a police chief who had justifiable gripes with his officer's behavior. At least that's my theory. ******MINOR SPOILER******* Gary Busey leads the other half of the cast, those being the federal agents who are out to freeze the predator and steal its technology. This is definitely Busey's best performance next to Lethal Weapon 1. His character's a hard@$$ who doesn't have the desire to talk to anyone who isn't within his tight-knit agency, so much so that it's obvious he's going through major pains when he finally cracks and tells Glover's character all he knows. Must've been hard for him. And oddly enough, Busy and Glover make a decent team, even if it was one that resembled two magnets that naturally act against each other. We find out a bit more about the predator's background. His ship was nice, ditto for his array of new weapons, and the ending where we see that predators had been on earth for centuries was cool. So they CAN speak English, hehehe ******END SPOILER******* And the bit where Glover's character greets Morton Downey Jr's as the latter is bugging him for comments after yet another series of murders? Beautiful :-D My first minor gripe about this film is that there are a few too many expendables who show up simply to be chopped up by the predator. While the first movie had a small number of characters, so that every death was noticed and counted, the second one has literally dozens of cops, federal agents, drug dealers and civilians who encounter and are killed by the monster. That created some amount of de-sensitivity to the violence, which is bad, although the predator's victims are never forgotten by Glover's character as he relentlessly goes after the monster, which is good. My second gripe is that the villainous drug dealers are all one-dimensional, as there's nothing more to them than standard run-of-the-mill bad guys who kill with no regard for the sanctity of human life. It would've been nice if we had at least one drug dealer who had a positive side to him, just like the police officers' and federal agents' negative sides that were so superbly put on film. But then again, that's a problem that the first movie suffered from also  showing 'terrorists' who kill for no reason, and who only exist to be exterminated by Arnie and Company's righteous soldiers.I suppose the reason for that is because the audience wants simplicity and the freedom to place people within Good and Evil labels, and doesn't want complicated social explanations that can turn a good person into a bad one. If only it was easy enough for me to say that it's just a movie and it shouldn't be taken more seriously than that, but it's not, as this is the image of 'evil drug dealers' and 'evil terrorists' that the ignorant masses see that makes it so easy for slimeball politicians to manipulate public opinion. But that's a whole different discussion altogether. To summarize  we have locals cops on one side who want the predator's head for killing some of their own, and we have federal agents on the other side who want the predator's head so they can steal his technology, and lastly we have drug dealers who want everyone's head simply because those people exist. And the predator is running amok in the middle of it all. That makes this a great film. Just remember to keep in mind why Danny Glover's character is so outraged at the predator's killing of humans, because human life is supposed to be precious, and it's easy to forget that when so many characters in this film act otherwise. After all, we have enough people in the real world who think that life is cheap. No point in seeing fictitious characters who do the same.",Predator 2
231,strangelexicon,An excellent sequel,10,4 August 2006,"I can imagine that Predator-2 would not be as popular as the movie that preceded it but even so, there is absolutely nothing so bad in this movie to justify its extremely low rating. I guess that a lot of voters don't actually follow the Predator franchise. The director delivered exactly what a fan wanted with urban LA providing the sweaty, suspenseful atmosphere and background, loads of action and the Predator kicking ass. They've also introduced a new array of Predator weapons which don't seem out of place at all. The Predator related murders getting confused and mixed up with all the crime and gangster related violence in LA, was pure genius or at least a very good move. The opening sequence to reintroduce the Predator was amazing. This movie was extremely realistic and gory as well. It is too under-appreciated.

This sequel keeps you on the edge of your seat and is everything you'd expect from a ""Sorry, we can't get Arnie"" sequel. We'll let him off though, as it was because of Terminator 2 - but just think, Arnie WOULD have done this film if it WASN'T for T2, and that would've been something AMAZING! But for what it is Predator 2 is still a very good, epic Predator movie. And, sadly for the last time in a Predator film history, it has a STAR. Danny Glover wouldn't be my obvious choice for a Predator detective but he really, REALLY pulls it off. He get's so freaked out. I only enjoyed Saw because of his excellent performance in Predator 2. My final thought is that I'm gutted, as always, I never saw this in the cinema. The music again is brilliant and in true sequel style they haven't changed the themes, the Predator theme music is my favourite film score of all time, Predator 2 is nothing short of the first - well executed and most importantly, just like it was the first time round :) Here's to Predator 2! WANT SOME CANDY!??",Predator 2
233,jdengraver,Why the hate?,8,31 January 2021,"Arguments over which is better; 1 or 2, will never be resolved. They're both great movies that have their strengths and weaknesses.Predator 2 is a ""stand alone"" sequel as it doesn't neccessarily require you to watch the first film.I'll admit, Danny Glovers character is an unusual candidate as the Predators ""worthy adversary"" compared to Arnold's ""Dutch"" Schaeffer and perhaps that's why people slammed this film.Where ""Dutch"" is a highly skilled and battle hardened special forces soldier, Glovers character is a tougher-than-average detective, suffering from OCD and authority issues.I'm able to look passed that disparity because I'm not here to watch the hero. I'm here to watch an intergalactic hunter tear junkies and gangbangers limb from limb.Some other review complained that the ""baddies were stereotyped"". Well, it was filmed in the early 90s pal. There were no such thing as ""diversity quotas"" or ""affirmative acrion"".The warring factions are Columbian drug cartels and Jamaican voodoo gangs. Hence, that is the demographic required to portray such characters.As for this particular Predator; it seems that he highly underestimated his adversary. It's the only reason I can think of as to how Lt Harrigan (Glover) is able to get the upper hand on him.The story itself has a few more nuances and layers than the original and that can make for more enjoyable viewing.Try not to compare the two. They're both great action movies. Neither one is designed to win Academy awards.",Predator 2
234,VisionExile,Not quite rocket science but pretty good. A welcome urban elaboration.,6,24 July 2019,"When compared to the first Predator, this one slightly falls flat. Very few good one-liners, and no Arnold Schwarzenegger. No Jesse Ventura either. BUT, more blood and upside down corpses than the original sort of helps this installment. The final scenes (with the ancient pistol) definitely add 1 star and bring up some great questions that could make for some good sequels. AND, the Predator has more screen time as well as revealing more subtle elements to its character (i.e. not killing a pregnant woman or child). Yes it is kind of just different window-dressing applied to a favorite villain. Yet, the urban scenery and Danny Glover -NOT Arnold Action Hero- kind of makes for an enjoyable elaboration on the original movie. Would it be better if everything from the first was just revisited in the second as a rehash? To me, it is great to see the Predator wreaking havoc in gritty, drug war-torn L.A. The different city environments and scenarios are great, and Glover is a welcome character (NOT a super Alpha male in some fantasy video game setting). He is good as an almost ""everyday"" cop who physically stands no chance against the alien. Instead, his reliance/opposition to others and THE SYSTEM is an interesting angle. The city itself allows some nice different canvases (subway, skyscraper, dangerous alleys) for the Predator to interact in. Sort of an Urban Jungle of its own.The plot isn't really riveting, and maybe there are scientific holes here and there. But I watched it mainly for the Predator- to see the great hunter in action and dueling against new foes. Definitely welcome is the return of the familiar heat vision, voice translating, and light-bending camouflage. New weapons and a peek into the alien spaceship/trophy room are also great tidbits. Details, yes, but cool to have more elements to understand the iconic character with. More Predators (with names - check the IMDB trivia section) arrive in a fantastic short scene, too.Overall this movie isn't as cohesive as the first- numerous side distractions that detract from the focus. It is hard to understand who/which are the key points and how they affect the pursuit of the Predator. Glover pursuing the alien alone in L.A. would have made for a more streamlined story. Gary Busey does well as a government agent who works with and against Glover. His personality is unhinged and erratic, and would have been a good addition to the first Predator movie. And, some of his crew's pursuit of the Predator seemed to predict the look of the X-Files....at least the use of flashlights, government secrecy, and rogue violent tactics. The addition of Morton Downey Jr. is surreal to anyone who remembers his tv show. Interesting elements of media voyeurism and reality tv are acknowledged here in their early stages.I'd watch this again. And recommend it to anyone who likes older action/sci-fi movies. It doesn't need to be viewed shortly after the original- it stands alone and can be appreciated without knowing much from the first Predator. Being a fan of the first movie helps though. Good Sci-fi with a big budget and great (old-style) effects.",Predator 2
235,StarWarsMoviesSuck,One of the best sequels of all time,10,8 January 2017,"I'm throwing on an extra point, since it's one of my favorite movies to watch. P2 is not a perfect movie, but it's a fun and thrilling experience. If the third act could be completely overhauled, then it would rival Predator 1 in overall quality. What P2 has that P1 does not have is the fun-factor. It has more colorful characters and a wide variation of scenery, offering a very good presentation of Los Angeles. The decision to make it more humorous was a correct one, but unfortunately problems arise.The third act for whatever reason became a campy mess. Let me just add her as well that I wish Keyes would've lived, as he was a solid character as Harrigan's mysterious rival. The predator up to his unmasking was presented masterfully, but the unmasking turned it into a comedy puppet. Did Fox do this on purpose to make the movie flop? Who knows. Regardless, it excels where most sequels do not, and as-of today is the only true sequel for the Predator franchise",Predator 2

238,Tom16uk,Not for the faint hearted,7,17 June 2005,"I was very surprised by how good this film was. You would have thought that the absence of Arnie and the quiet, tension building jungle would wreck the film. Instead, it see's a different side to the Predator.Los Angles is the setting for this film, with a surprising date of 1997. The view of this year from a 1990 perspective is not bad at all. The settings and cast are all great, and make the film very atmospheric, because cleverly, the cast are all very stereotypical of modern American people - Bill Paxton plays a young, out going rookie cop with terrible jokes, the Jamaican drug gangs.. well enough said there. And Danny Glover plays a good typical cop, who looks as though he's had experience at his job and says a great line to Bill Paxton ""Welcome to the war"" (upon Paxtons joining of the cops) The Predators arrival is well noted after some Jamaican drug gang members get slaughtered and hung up. Of course, the Predator takes people out all the way through the film - his calling card being to hang his victims up, legs first. Somehow though, you get the impression that the Predator just doesn't belong in this city, and that he played a much better role in the first Predator film.The special effects are really no different than the first film. The predators invisibility still shown very cleverly by the magnified scenery, giving the outline of his body so we can see him. Again though, this works a lot better in the first film, because he camouflaged nicely in all the jungle. The addition of more weapons is very interesting though - a deadly round Frisbee and spear come in very handy.Of course though, the most talked about part of this film is the scene in which we see an alien head in the predators trophy cabinet. Its Not just any old alien head, but one from the 'Alien' films.After people saw this during the 90's, they realised what had to come soon..AVP! (Aliens vs. Predator, 2004) Its no big deal now of course, but it would have been interesting 15 years ago.I would love to say this is an excellent film, but somehow I think that the jungle suited the Predator best. But, for the fans out there of action, I would say have a go! Its a gory film, but the neat additions to the first film do a lot of justice.",Predator 2

This movie is a great way to see more of that incredible being, yet the rest of the cast is so incredibly bad that most of the time you feel like you're watching a d-movie. Enter Danny Glover and you know that this is Hollywood, but even his appearances make you roll your eyes most of the time. The dialog is crap, it's like you take macho-lines from other movies and just mix it all together to get this movie. Interestingly, most of the characters had some kind of an accent. A nod to Arnie, maybe?You need to see this film if you like the predator, or want to fill the missing link between Predator 1 and the newer AvP movies.But it's far from eye candy!",Predator 2
241,predatorlm,Underrated classic,8,1 February 2021,"This movie didn't deserve the hate it got. Danny glover was definitely the best among the cast and Gary Busey was very fun to watch. Although at first glance it may look like a predator duplicate in a different setting but if you watch the movie it is pretty vital to the predator lore, even more than the first one. It shows a lot about how predators think and there traditions while the first was just an action movie. I love both but it's easier to undervalue the second one so it's important to point out it's strong points.",Predator 2
242,Dutch90,Underrated Sequel,8,14 April 2018,"Predator 2 gets a lot of flak, mainly for not featuring Arnold and not living up to its predecessor. While it definitely does not best the 1987 original, I will argue that this is still a sequel worth looking into. First, the things that are true about the criticism leveled at Predator 2 - yes, it lacks the atmosphere and tension of the original Predator. The inhumanly muscular, quintessentially '80s' mercenaries from the first film are gone, replaced by more conventional cop characters, led by Lethal Weapon's Danny Glover who ironically portrays Mike Harrigan a loose cannon closer to to Riggs than to Murtaugh. The iconic jungle setting is changed to Los Angeles, inexplicably set 7 years into the future without any sort of technological advances or plot elements that make this a different LA than it was in present day 1990. Predator 2 is a somewhat more conventional, pulpy action/horror film, full of explosions and cheesy moments such as an over-the-top closeup of a decapitated voodoo shaman's head, frozen in a scream. The film plays with its titular monster's iconic hunting gear, adding all sorts of new gizmos that have since become a staple of Predator merchandise and memorabilia, almost losing itself in the vast array of weapons and gadgets that the creature now has at its disposal. What is also true is that the plot does little to avoid cliches, ranging from cop cliches (Harrigan butting heads with his by-the-book, office-bound superiors) to sci-fi horror staples such as the shady government spooks who are trying to capture and weaponize the creature (clearly inspired by that other Fox horror series, Alien).But what is also true is that Predator is just a very fun film. It realizes its potential cheesiness and just goes with. Less subtly so than the original, which may add up to people's dislike of it. While the Predator is somewhat demystified by appearing much earlier in the film and spending considerably less time behind its light-bending camouflage, the film teases us with a massive amount of lore that we only get to glimpse (they have a culture, they gather all sorts of extraterrestrial trophy's including the famous Alien's head) and have still only scratched the surface of. While this has been explored to greater lengths in the expanded universe, and not always in a good way (the comic book Predators are basically Klingons at this point), the filmic universe hints at a unique and mysterious society that we're still yet to fully appreciate. Also, the film is full of action and maintains the Predator's aura of an elusive, unstoppable force that treats humans as little more than wild animals to be hunted down and mounted on a wall.In short, Predator is more than a Schwarzenegger vehicle. The Predator creature is definitely capable of carrying the series beyond a single human lead, and is definitely worth seeing even if it isn't facing the Goverator.",Predator 2
243,highflying_falcon,"Too much action, not enough plot.",4,25 July 2004,"Although there is no emphasis on the origins of the predator in both films, at least the first one had a reasonable plot.This sequel had way too much gun fights especially in the films intention of portraying the future(filmed in 1990 but story based in 1997).The actors were okay however with Danny Glover playing the main role as a cop trying to avenge his friend. There were scenes where the predator strikes at a group of seven armed drugdealers and a train full of armed passengers to one where it is running away from one person which was a bit unreasonable I believe.Though I wouldn't recommend it, everybody is entitled to their own opinion.",Predator 2

If we ignore the fact that it's a sequel, we can ask ""does the movie stand up in it's own right"".  That's the problem, with the Predator history, it does continue the story well.  As a movie in it's own right, it's just an Average Action Flick.  The story revolves around Lieutenant Mike Harrigan who is trying to keep LA from blowing apart as two rival drug gangs fight over their turf.  A new player comes to town and yep, it's that one ugly mother f*****r.  It's basically a re-hash of the story of the first movie except relocating it to LA.The acting is fairly solid.  Danny Glover is pretty damn good, where as Busey seems a bit erratic.  The action is nice to, although some of the effects are a bit ropey.Overall, it's an alright action flick, but nothing great.

Another scene is were the Elder Predator gives Dany Glover a gun from the 1700's.And the scene were the ships takes off into space and it turns out it was underground the whole time!

Predator was a surprise hit with Schwarzenegger leading the way. So if we can't get him back we'll find everyone else from the 80's action genre to be in it. Glover and Busey from Lethal Weapon, Paxton from Aliens, Maria Conchita Alonso from The Running Man, and Adam Baldwin from Full Metal Jacket. Oh and why not throw in the loud mouth of the day Morton Downey Jr. just to round things out.If that isn't formulaic enough lets have the Jamaicans be the bad guys. After Bond faced Voodoo in Live and Let Die it became the hip new adversary. Sure there was no real reason for it, but why not. A few years earlier it would have been ninjas.The movie is jam packed with bad puns and stereo typical characters. The loose canon, the ladies man, the hard as nails woman, and the lone hero.There are some nice elements but most of them were story ideas from the first movie. The gun from the French Revolution and so on. All and all it's not a horrible movie for it's day, it just doesn't improve anything on the original.

The special effects and story was good, even Carl Weathers did a good job as Dillon and the action scenes were excellent...... PREDATOR 2 doesn't even follow on from Predator, no Arnie or any of the original characters from the first film. Instead, PREDATOR 2 introduces us to an annoying Gary Busey with a cheesey grin on his face, some annoying Jamaican gangs, Bill Paxton, Maria Conchita Alonso, Ruben Blades and Danny Glover... The idea the predator being in a city full of that amount of violence and not being harmed earlier in the movie is ridiculous. The thought of the predator wiping out a while Jamaican gang who are armed without a scratch on it is hilarious and Danny Glover and Gary Busey treats the movie like a comedy rather than a serious film. Bill Paxton is annoying as he's always moaning, acting like a fool or crying. The action maybe be nearly as great as the original but doesn't deliver as much as the original.

The opening scene is beyond amazing...so over the top. Endless killing and chaos. The predator played by the late great Kevin Peter Hall, is perfect. Unlike in the new AVP movies, the predator stalks and kills people the way he ought to. There are a ton of wicked death scenes in the movie. Very inventive with a whole array of new weapons.Solid story, cool quotes, decent acting (except for Bill Paxton) and tons and tons of action! This movie is a load of fun. If it wasn't for Paxton trying to revise his role in Aliens (and failing), I would have given this movie a 9.

252,neo_jenner,Want some candy?,10,25 April 2004,"I've always loved this movie ever since I saw it way back in 1990 at the theater. Predator is great, but part 2 is equally great. It may not be quite as primal and fast paced, but it more than makes up for it with well developed characters, a more detailed back story and compelling setting, and a deeply developed story. If the predator wasn't in this movie, the story set up would make for a great movie on its own.You may not realize it when you're watching it, but the climax of this movie is nearly 45 minutes long! Starting from the subway shoot out, the tunnel chase, the street-roof chase, the slaughter house fight, the roof top fight that spills into the apartment building across the street, the elevator shaft, and finally to the Predator ship itself. It is a breathless series of action sequences strung together so well that it's almost astonishing to look back on it and imagine such effort was crafted to make this movie.This movie would never be made today. A sequel without the main character from the fist movie? A whole new setting? This would be seen as too great a risk, but in 1990 movie studios were still run by creative people, not accountants. This movie is a true, unsung classic of sci-fi, coming from an age when great care was put into genre movies that had strong stories, good characters, and dialogue that didn't sound silly and forced. Lines weren't meant to become one-liners, they were just so memorable that they ended up that way.""You can't see the eyes of the demon, until him come calling."" ""Okay P-ssy face, it's your move."" ""Danny Boy.""And of course...""Want some candy?""Granted, those aren't as good as the classics from the first Predator, like:""You son of a bitch!"" ""I ain't got time to bleed."" ""Knock Knock.""

""You are one ugly mother f---er.""and of course...""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""Last but not least, the music score from Predator 2 is one of the best ever. Alan Silvestri hasn't topped his work from this movie which has to have one of the most complex, layered, and just flat out astounding main themes ever composed for an action movie, or any movie.And of course, it had the cameo that sparked the whole Alien vs Predator phenomenon.

Also, here's the possible spoiler, I notice that they violated the tagline from the original, which indicated the predator had never been on earth before. That is hardly the worst thing about the movie. I rated it a 4, but debated giving it a 3. I thought the ending was pretty weak. Gary Busey was a little too over the edge for me, and too draconian. I felt the Busey character could have been taken down a notch or two and improved the believabilty of the movie. Glover, whom I like, was weak.

256,CubeRic9000,A city tearing itself apart - insert Predator here - and watch what happens!,7,13 August 2011,"It's refreshing to see many reviews on here that really rate this film. As people have said, there is more Predator time on screen, the action sequences are exciting, new weapons, all these things really add to this being a great movie. But for me, I find there is one main element which made this film on a par with the original, and some may say, even better.What was executed perfectly, in order to differentiate it from the first, is the mood of the piece. This is one eerie, complex, and at times downright terrifying film. The way Los Angeles was painted for this, as the platform for the story to go to work, is simply ingenious. The entire movie works to represent a city in the depths of despair. There are a few key scenes I would like to touch on here.Firstly, the film immediately starts by placing the viewer in the near future (well 1997 was the near future when the film was released), in a very bleak Los Angeles, which is boiling over in a cesspit of crime. Street warfare is taking place on a mammoth scale, between the authorities and drug gangs. The sheer ferocity of the warfare to open the film, can't help but make a viewer engage and feel uneasy about this city. Adding to this is the aggressive nature at which the drug gang goes to work. Restocking their weapons, encouraging each other, snorting drugs mid fire fight, there is no fear of consequence, a frightful thing to witness. Then insert a Predator into story, and make an already horrific scene worse, leaving behind an unexplainable bloodbath.Secondly, the police station scene also works very well to set the mood. No violence or warfare, but just a police station jammed to the walls with criminals, needing to be processed. It is here that our main character (Lieutenant Mike Harrigan) explains the drug war, to a new recruit. I really like the scripting in this scene, and throughout the movie. The dialogue is clever, and paints a vivid picture of the situation, with no gloss or wasted words, just descriptions spoken with exceptional potency. A hidden gem in this scene also helping to set the mood is the sweat. Everyone is sweating profusely from a heat wave, and the dust in the air is lit by intrusive beaming rays of sun through the filthy office windows. It all works so well to present a city and a police force nearing breaking point.Thirdly, for vicious intensity, I cannot go past the action scene on the subway train. The opening shot of a subway train thundering past, immediately feels intimidating. Add in a sweaty crowded train, more criminals, and our main villain, and we have a showdown in a tight space whilst in motion. This for me is probably the creepiest scene from the whole Predator franchise. And although so many elements are mixed together to make it special, the lighting takes all honours. The use of strobe lighting effects, and gun muzzle flashes, make this edge of your seat viewing. This is horror at the highest level, played out to perfection, in an action film.There are so many parts of this film that work to set and complement the mood of the piece. From the scenes mentioned, to the drug gangs voodoo magic rituals, a back alley meeting with a drug lord, and also the sickening and deplorable media coverage of Hard Copy. So many filmic aspects, from the dynamic and contrasting characters (without the macho) and the richness they bring to a dire situation, a score that is decisively injected throughout, and the lighting of the night to perfection. This truly is a great sequel, and don't get me wrong, the Predator steals the show once again. But I believe the silent achiever was the portrayal of a city with little to no hope left, which really is the all important catalyst to making this an original and highly entertaining film.",Predator 2
257,towt,Quite a good movie,9,30 December 2007,"Usually, most sequels to films aren't as good as their original. While this didn't have Arnold-like heroes, it still was very true to the Predator universe. The characters were well developed and you felt connected to them in a small way. Harrigan is quite the police officer. Bill Paxton is in this too, which is kind of cool as he played Hudson in Aliens.So, instead of a Jungle Jungle to fight in, you get a concrete jungle. Mix in drug warfare and such, and you have the ingredients for a very good movie.*Spoilers beyond this point* The final human vs predator battle scene is nothing short of amazing. This is what predator fans want in a film. And the issuing of the rifle to Danny Glover is a nice touch too. Since predators live on trophies, that is a neat thing.I hope they may another predator instead of these AvP movies, which are becoming a bit disappointing.",Predator 2
258,blackacid,Entertaining and under-rated... MCU prototype?,7,9 November 2015,"If there's a failed precursor to the Marvel Comic-book Universe this is possibly it.On a list of movies that got a critical kicking they didn't quite deserve, Predator 2 is a comic book movie that promised a crossover franchise and although flawed, it holds up well 25 years later and in many ways is ahead of its time. Heavily inspired by the Dark Horse comic that featured Dutch's brother as an LA gang cop, the lack of Arnie, who's wage demands were knocked back by the studio, clearly went against the movie from the start.In retrospect, Danny Glover's resourceful, seasoned LA gang cop is sound replacement and delivers in what is possibly his best action role. Compared to Murtagh in Lethal Weapon half a decade earlier, he looks a lot younger, fitter and buff enough as a believable opponent for the Predator.The supporting characters are total comic-book and right on the money.These larger than life, stereotypes fit beautifully into this world and there are so many of them, Colombians, Jamaicans, Bill Paxtons, that you don't have time to stop and think about their lack of dimension. They're bubble gum, and fun. A real treat for me watching 25 years on is the atmosphere and feel of the classic 80's sci-fi movies still celebrated today. Predator 2 almost seems to exist in the same universe as RoboCop, borrowing heavily from the aesthetic and attitude of the media, the overcrowded police station and Lewis in Maria Conchita Alonso, which is something that may have seemed derivative at the time but in retrospect, would not seem out of place now with the MCU. Drawing on many influences of the time, throwing them in a pot and seeing what comes out the other end is part of Predator 2's charm but also part of the problem, especially as it veers a little too close into ALIENS territory later in the film, however I can live with that and looking back makes me nostalgic for a great era of sci-fi. But it's not without flaws and there are a couple of problems I had at the time that are amplified now. On release, I felt the film was toned down, not as violent as the first and that it had possibly been edited for a lower rating. In retrospect, it's actually a far more violent film than the original, there's blood and bullets everywhere, but what I was picking up on and what I see clearly now, is more to do with the way Predator 2 is lit and shot. Stephen Hopkins was hired to direct only his 3rd film coming straight off the back of Nightmare On Elm St 5, a film that is widely regarded as the weakest of that franchise and aside from Lost In Space has mostly directed TV since.So it's no surprise that a lot of the scenes in Predator 2 look far less cinematic that they should and instead have more of an X-Files vibe. The lighting is too bright and colourful, whilst watching, you can't shake the fact that this is staged and shot on a set. In my view, it suffers the same problem as RoboCop 2 whereby the lower budget of the preceding film gave the original a rough and ready look, where the sequels ramp up the production values to the point where everything looks far too polished and fake. But crucially, the make up and blood looks almost clean enough to eat and the death scenes are just underwhelming.Exploding heads and chests are replaced with sparklers and cut away shots, which work well in the right context, the Reservoir Dogs torture is a great example of getting it right, but here the camera avoids everything so there's no pay off. You just get fragments and sweeps which are very effective in terms of replicating comic book panels but after the imaginative bloodbath of the first movie, you're left feeling short changed.During the opening sequence there are some brilliant cuts shot between VHS camera's, grainy, hand-held, shaky that represent the view of the media. They look far more realistic for my money and that's how I would have liked to have seen this picture shot.Overall, Predator 2 is a bold and innovative precursor to the MCU.It's a movie that appears to have been designed by a studio with bold plans for a bigger universe, heavily hinting at crossover potential and I would have loved to have seen this era of Fox expand into the Alien Vs Predator territory it hinted at, rather than the damp squibs that came a decade later. Ultimately, Fox picked an inexperienced director who didn't have the resume of a John McTiernan or James Cameron, presumably so that they had more control but in doing so, paid the price with a sequel that almost kills but lacks the genuine wonder and sincerity in its execution, that made the first movie so compelling.",Predator 2
259,Sausage_Demon,Great sequel,10,3 August 2007,"The victim of unjustified bashing, Predator 2 is one of those rare films that is as good as it's predecessor. P2 takes the Alien hunter into the jungle of concrete and brick known as LA. The beauty of this film, as with the original is it is effectively a war film with an Alien thrown into the midst, there is a plot that goes on in the world of P2 that has nothing to do with the ET Hunter until he starts offing people on both sides of the fighting. Drug lords and their gangs are out of control, the streets are often turned into bloody open battlefields as the police battle the gangs for control of the city, an awesome plot which is then amplified by the arrival of the Predator. The opening scene is of one of these battles and brilliantly introduces all the main characters to the story (barring Bill Paxton's character). The acting is good, and you care about the characters (something I found occurs in 80's-early 90's films more than modern film) and even if you remove the predator from the film you have enough depth and character to make an film based entirely on the police vs. gangs.The only thing this film didn't do as well as the original was I feel the Predator's eyes, there were too big and Human looking in the extreme close ups, whereas the original had those small nasty looking ones. But that is all, and it is something you don't really notice until you watch the film in depth many times.Despite the poor rating on IMDb, and what bad things people say about this film it is as good as the original, it furthers the plot, it ups the ante, it does all the things a good sequel should do. Great film.All we need now is a Predator 3, which would be cool to see set in a place of desert warfare.",Predator 2
260,msr-22559,Highly Underrated Sequel,8,25 March 2020,"Many people think that a sequel is supposed to better a previous film, when all a sequel is supposed to do is try and equal the qualities of a previous film with a different story.Predator is one of the greatest action Sci-fi movies of all time, so of course it was going to be a difficult task to produce something that even came close. While Predator 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, it's still an entertaining movie throughout, with a decent cast including Danny Glover, Gary Busey and Bill Paxton.It's a shame that it didn't gross more money at the box office upon its release, in which it almost certainly would've done if Arnold had reprised his role. However, I think this is one of the first big budget movies that didn't require a ""superstar"" to achieve a satisfying outcome, and while some would argue that it may have turned out better with Arnold in the leading role, this shouldn't detract from what turned out to be a classic action Sci-fi movie on its own merit.",Predator 2
261,fart_fire69,shame,6,25 November 2002,"Well I must agree with the on going trend that this movie wasn't as good as the first one. Even though Danny Glover was decent, and that the Predator had more weapons, the trophey case (which introduced the idea Alien vs. Predator), and the different/multiple Predators on their ship.I think what sucked about Predator 2 was that it didn't have the bad ass attitude of the Marine squad with their big ass guns and shoot first ask later attitude. I also hated the bad acting from all the supporting actors. It got really annoying (like bill paxton's character). Also, the stupid comedy events like the stupid granny with the broom killed the realism of the movie.I think it was a great concept for a plot, just the director went a whole different route from the first movie.",Predator 2
262,NightoftheDawnoftheDayoftheDead,I like it.,8,22 March 2003,"I may like this movie even more than the first Predator.  I think no-Arnold is actually a good thing here.  I've seen him plenty of times, and in this movie the ""cool"" factor and the focus is pretty much all on the Predator. More Predator weapons are seen, you get to see the inside of a Predator ship, including a trophy room. (look for the scene of the window of a shop with stuffed animal carcasses for a nice comparison to our culture)People don't seem to like this movie, and I don't remember it thrilling me terribly the first time I watched it either.  Having recently watched it however, I think it's a great action movie.  It's not really set in reality, more of a near-future setting, so they can get away with the crime ridden city and packed police stations.  It's almost a comic book setting, but gritty enough to work in live video.  The director gave the movie a great claustrophobic feel. This movie has more action, more Predator, more Predator weapons, less characters that aren't a whole lot more than muscles, not that those kinds of characters can't be fun either.. and I think it's a lot of fun, and doesn't even get too out there.  The slaughterhouse scene could be very debatable with the silver suits and liquid nitrogen guns, but it made sense in the context they were using them, and I think those suits even look somewhat like the Predator's own suit, with the shoulder mounted devices and all.  Those suits were human technology to avoid detection by the Predator, the Predator's suit is technology to be stealthy against the humans.If you don't like a cool alien killing all kinds of people, shootouts, gritty city settings, and excess blood and explosions, what are you watching an action movie for in the first place?  I like the city setting much more than the jungle/no-technology setting of the first film.  Don't get me wrong, I love the first film.  I'm a fan of the Predator in these movies, not Arnold, so I have to go with this one if I'm going to choose favorites here.",Predator 2

It's definitely a flaw when the movie tries to repeat the same ''what is it?'' suspense. But there are still good parts to P2. I'm not so sure about the little pressie Danny receives at the end, but I wouldn't give it something like, 4/10. I still enjoyed Predator 2 despite the flaws in it. (Oh, and by the way, the Predator DOSEN'T see the light through the normal thermal vision, too everybody who says that). I think all of us know there's been a lot worse crap B-movies horror movies made. Although it dosn't compare to other horror movies either, Pred 2 is just above average.",Predator 2
264,TRENTY28,Better than the first!,9,26 May 1999,The last 20 mins of this film have to be one of the most action packed of any film and make this film in my opinion better than the first.The first one was fairly predictable with its military mumbo jumbo thrown in.  This sequel carries a more pacey feel to it throughout.

268,sean-1225,Why all the hate?,8,3 January 2011,"Last night I watched 'Predator' for the first time after receiving it for Christmas. I love nearly all of Arnie's movies, and this is up there with his all time greatest. It was fantastic and I enjoyed it all the way through. Its a must see movie and well worth watching if you enjoyed films such as Terminator, Alien (not Alien VS Predator though, thats where things really get bad) or any action/horror/science-fiction movie in general. Then I watched this movie... Honestly, all I can say is that this was a great movie. It was absolutely fantastic and could even be as good as the first one. Im not going to explain the full plot or anything at the moment because you can easily look that up, but I am going to say that Danny Glover done a great job as being the protagonist, who basically in short is looking for the Predator. The Predator is looking for humans to hunt for as a sport. People complain about this movie saying that the Predator is killing random people, which was not the purpose of the first movie. The Predator is in a new kind of jungle, L.A, where he can easily find targets. We got to learn more about the Predator himself, his weapons and what his ship looks like. Also the movie has some great lines, and the best Predator 2 is great and just as good as the first one: 8/10",Predator 2

However... a fair warrior who hunts for sport.The megalomaniac intro of the movie... is perhaps one of the best intros in action movies EVER! A vote of 5,5 is not to be taken seriously.This is a classic action movie - it has a solid storyline and suspense and of course... some special effects.

270,abbo450,the killer of a franchise,2,25 August 2007,"The original Predator was a really good film to watch. Although it wasn't particularly scary, it was fun, exciting and it had Sir. Arnie. So when I rented this out a couple of nights ago I was expecting something similar, fun but chilling (despite Glover). Instead I get a stupid boring piece of garbage! As I expected Glover is awful but everyone in the film gives terrible performances, even Paxton is average after his brilliant performance in Aliens. The script is full of senseless dribble and the racist gangs are so- American stereotypical, drug smoking lunatics. Also I have an unusual quip about the language. I have no problem with swearing in films and sometimes it is sort of essential. In this film they just pack it in, every 5 minutes a person swears!. I'm sorry but this is too much and totally ridiculous and pointless. And then we come to the worst thing about it, The Predator. Arnie's guy was menacing, stealthy and strong at the same time which is helped by the total beat down and laugh scenes at the end of the first film. Also it looks brilliant, just as good as the alien effects. This makes him formidable and certainly not someone you'd want to meet. In this film the predator could have been beaten up by a hard teen. You need the creature to be threatening in a these films for it to work, this weedy thing doesn't help things and coupled with the other terrible parts of this film it turns into a cesspool. The thing that ""saves this"" is the interesting ending where we discover some of the culture of the predators. Them rewarding glover with a trophy and the collection of skulls on the spaceship's wall is very insightful and was the only decent thing in this film. All successful sagas (and by that I mean 4-7 films) the sequel needs to be quite good. If this had been better I think we could have seen a lot more predator films but this pile of garbage destroyed a potentially great franchise.",Predator 2

Then he starts seeing blurry outlines (too predictable). Then Predator shows himself on a subway train killing a few. In the climax the cop chases him to a slaughterhouse where he injures Predator. The fight takes them through an apartment complex,the streets, and into the sewer system when they reach the Predators ship. In a fight the cop ***SPOILER*** kills the beast.

The first Predaor movie set in a jungle with Schwarezeneger and his crew was a totally epic movie from the beginning to the end...a classic.. a real masterpiece that I can watch again and again! So this movie Predator 2 has only good ending, and also epic music which is copy/pasted from the original Predator. Everything else in forgettable from actors to the idea to set story in big city.

Predator delivers spectacular visual suspense right from the start and beckons an electrifying climax between Harrigan and the deadly Predator, essentially I find this film to be a lot more gripping and intriguing than the previous Predator motion picture but as far as I'm concerned both movies give a unique visual performance that is intercepted into the hearts of the audience.",Predator 2
274,staven600,Odd sequel,7,20 February 2016,"I loved this film. It's really, really bad, but easily one of the funniest films I've seen recently. For some strange reason it's set a mere seven years into the future from 1990, 1997, during a heat wave and gang war in LA. The fact that it's in the future doesn't add much to the story, but I guess the cars look a little different. And the guns. Danny Glover is wound up in the most ridiculous way and for no justifiable reason. One minute he climbs out of a gangster's limo in a cloud of smoke and tells them to lay of the ganj as he goes to see a mystic informant, and the next he's rushing around mad and wound up for no reason like a raging paranoiac with a fear of heights and no time to masturbate who curses birds. Bill Paxton is also ridiulous as his short-lived up and coming partner. The funniest scene in the film has him try to get in the hotboxed limo that takes Glover to the informant, before running after it and shouting ""f--k!"" as it drives off. I don't know, I guess he really wanted to get stoned. It's a weird film, and does not make much sense. Danny Glover's character has an intense fear of heights that means the finale of the film is a little longer than usual. I guess it serves to give him a disadvantage to the predator but they don't use it. Instead he climbs out down a ledge and curses about how he doesn't need birds, then finds himself in a spaceship. The characters are all ridiculous, especially Glover's character, who shouts at everything and runs around talking to himself. In one scene he rushes after Gary Busey's equally frustrated agent and grabs him by the collar, but while other films would have him approach casually like a bad ass, or meet him in a corridor, this film has him run out of his office and run down stairs, barging past people, despite the fact that Busey is walking slowly away. It just looks silly and I'm sure it's intentional, because there are many other things that make no sense. In one scene Paxton and Glover are both wearing suits and trilbies, despite having never worn them before, and they never wear them again. It's just slightly bewildering, and kudos to the film makers if it was intentional, because it works without being obvious or self conscious.I don't know, I'll definitely be watching this again, but although unique it's not as good an action film as the first Predator.",Predator 2

It was considered a B movie and got middling reviews and keeping this in mind Predator 2 should seem like a decent sequel. Predator 2 is different in many ways- None of the main cast return and the setting isn't a lush jungle in Mexico anymore, it is downtown los angeles. But there are some decent set pieces and one in particular where the Predator descends upon a gang is quite good.

279,r_scott73,"Second Time, Almost as Good as the First",7,23 March 2012,"Unfortunately, 'Predator 2' is something of an underrated film. It is not as polished as its predecessor, but it does work. By transplanting the action from the jungle to an urban environment, the sequel manages to feel original and does not seem as though it is a simple retread of what has been seen before. Combined with the change in setting is a change in cast, which also works to ensure that the second movie does not unduly ape the first. The film succeeds best when it evolves the character of its titular creature - in terms of technology and the Predator's outlook on hunting, innocence and the suitability of its trophies, the film manages to provide a pleasing depth. The movie's greatest stumble comes in its sometimes uncertain tone. It is mostly serious and action oriented and yet occasional lapses into surprisingly broad humour (including one bizarrely and exceptionally misplaced comedic sequence during the film's climax) undermine an otherwise well crafted action film.Interestingly, the film's post-final-confrontation tag sequence is very, very good - better even than the comparable scene from the first movie. The ending sequence is simultaneously ominous, thrilling and suggestive of (potential) future instalments - a great ending can cover a multitude of sins and in this case, the strength of the film's denouement is such that it leaves the viewer suddenly anxious to see the rest of the story - unfortunately as yet not fully explored.",Predator 2

Special effects, actors, music and scenes are awesome, great FX as well for a movie from 1990!
To the ones saying this movie sucks since Arnie is not in it, he wouldn't fit anyways... This is about regular bad-ass Cops that meet an Alien entity of which they know nothing about! That's the Whole idea! Using Arnie would spoil all of this, specially since he was a 'Mercenary' and weapon expert and he also already knew how to defeat the Alien threat!
Also the set would be ridiculous... A guerrilla fighting an Aline threat in the middle of LA... Do people really think that would work? Get Real.
Amazing movie and one of my all time favorite sequels!",Predator 2
281,TotenRot,"Decent action, but the plot aims for the wrong audience",7,7 December 2004,"This is a decently entertaining movie, but with some flaws.The biggest flaw in my opinion is how the gangs are portrayed in the beginning. The characters seem to cartoonish and unreal, making a bad first impression, than can last for the whole movie. However, I find the main characters in the movie, although maybe a bit too charicaturish, are doing a good job making you care about them just enough to be interested in their fate.The biggest problem with the plot is that everyone who sees the movie has already seen the first Predator movie. The plot tries to do what the first movie did, make the audience wonder what this creature is. But we all already know what the guy is, so that part of the plot misses the audience.The rest of the plot mostly works though, and we do get to learn a bit more about these ruthless killers.I give this one 6.5/10. A bit above average.I've read several other comments about this movie, and I feel I need to clear up some misconceptions:**** SPOILERS ***** The Predators does NOT speak English. They replay parts of recorded sound. And being intelligent creatures having spent centuries on earth, they're able to put these recorded bits and pieces into context and replay them at an appropriate moment.The predator did NOT see HEAT from the light sources. He scanned different frequency bands until he saw some other emission reflected from the dust in the air.The other predators did not help out their friend, because it was his battle. The predators hunt to show their manhood. Getting help from the others would probably mean lost honor, or some such.The ship was not in the basement of the building. It was below, in some abandoned tunnel or cave or something. How it got there in the first place, yes I agree that's a bit strange.Yes, the elevator would not crush anyone underneath. But hanging below one closing in on the ground may cause a momentary laps of reason. I think the main character is not the only one who would struggle thinking clearly in that situation.",Predator 2
282,a_forbes,"Predator fans will like it, but others should steer clear",6,12 August 2004,"In this sequel to Predator, a new alien hunter appears in the urban jungle of Los Angeles in the ""future"" of 1997. As a fan of John McTiernan's superior sci-fi thriller, Predator, I can enjoy the sequel on the level of more-of-a-good-thing. Unfortunately, it is not a particularly good film. Danny Glover does his best to be a tough, no-nonsense cop, but the role is written so poorly that it comes off as rather lame. The acting is, for the most part, very poor. Especially irritating are Morton Downey Jr. as a sleazy journalist and the usually solid Bill Paxton (playing his typical live-wire character, but here lacking the strong guiding hand of his best directing partner, James Cameron). On the plus side, Rubén Blades provides solid support as Glover's right hand man, Gary Busey is as good as ever, and Calvin Lockhart is brilliant in an all-too-brief part as Jamaican druglord King Willie. Director Stephen Hopkins infuses the film with style and good action, but the film lacks direction. It is also very dated, being an obvious product of 80s-90s transition period.6/10 -- Good fun for fans of the original, but not likely to win over anyone else",Predator 2
283,DoctorKingSchultz,Not A Good One,5,23 January 2012,"I just finished watching this about five minutes ago. I've liked Predator for years, the Alien films for even longer. Hated AvP for a few years, and disliked Predators since that came out. I figured I HAD to see Predator 2. The concept is interesting; a Predator stalks his prey in Los Angeles while the city is experiencing a crime wave. A change of scenery from the first Predator. Sounds kinda cool, right? Wrong. The movie shoves that crime wave down your throat from the start.The movie begins with an over-the-top, silly shootout between these downright ridiculous gangsters and the police. I don't like to be nitpicky, but these guys are packing more firepower than the Marines. They retreat into their little hideout and snort coke by the handful, rejuvenated and ready to kill more cops. It's just dumb. I thought ""Okay, maybe this is just to emphasize that the city is full of these heavily armed bad guys."" Throughout the rest of the film we're constantly reminded that ""Hey! I'm big, scary, and tough an- What?! What's that? A shadowy figure just stabbed my friend! Shoot it!"" I mean, yes I suppose the original Predator had it's fair share of silly moments, but they were carried out with far more class than this garbage.I don't want to compare this to the original; it's a bad film on it's own. The characters are cardboard cutouts. I'm all for having your typical array of characters in a film, but there needs to be some redeeming factor, something that makes up for it. The thing that stops this movie from a score any lower than a five is the Predator itself. It's a great monster! It combines all the aspects of your standard scary creature and gives it an intellect and tons of gadgets. Combine that with the concept of ""Now we're the hunted!"" and that's why the Predator has become such an iconic figure in the Sci-Fi world.I'll admit, about an hour, hour ten minutes into the movie I started to enjoy it. Not so much the one-on-one showdown with the Predator, but when Gary Busey and his guys were hunting the Predator. It was slightly suspenseful, as opposed to the hour of film before it. I was entertained. But right when the Predator reaches out and makes the audience jump and scream, and it delivers it's line, that's when the movie shifted back into mediocrity. That brings me to another point.While this doesn't weigh in on my score or opinion, how can the Predator talk without it's mask? Or better, how can it speak English without it's mask? I had thought all the dialogue we've ever heard from a Predator was from recordings it had made. As well, after the Predator's mask is removed, when we see things from the Predator's point of view, we still see in the heat vision that has become such an iconic part about the character. I mean, I could poke holes like this into some of my favorite movies; I don't mean it as criticism. Just wondering if I know the monster as well as I thought! So if you're reading this and shaking your head, still thinking ""This idiot doesn't know what he's talking about; it's a classic!"" Fine, so be it. I just can't understand these (mostly positive) reviews on here. Or at least, the ones I saw mostly ranged from seven to tens even! Hey, it's all opinion, and mine is that the film is bad. You DON'T have to watch it if you like the original, it'll just leave you very, very disappointed. I never thought I'd say it, but if you're looking for more trophy-collecting action, watch Predators!",Predator 2

285,krazyguy100,"The same things happen, only this time it sucks.",4,5 July 2012,"Now here is a textbook case of doing everything wrong in a sequel. 1990's Predator 2 refuses or fails to preserve what made the first Predator any good, makes some terrible creative decisions, and falls into a toxic vat of clichés. It has story problems, casting problems, and originality problems. The novelty of the Predator has worn out in this film, and the whole thing was a bore from start to finish. It's no wonder that this movie isn't brought up much when discussing the Predator franchise; it's overwhelmingly forgettable.So this time around, the locale has changed from a dense Mexican jungle to the city of Los Angeles. While this film could be admired for risking such a style change, the effect is unoriginal and very out-of- place. It takes away from the Predator's primal mystique. Also, for whatever reason, the script introduces an entirely new cast of characters, without a single returning actor and scarcely a mention of Arnold's original team. Again, this is not a bad change in and of itself, but here it only leads to a rehash of familiar plot devices. The audience already knows that the mystery killer is an alien hunter, but they still have to spend over an hour watching the main characters figure it out. Where's the fun, or the suspense, in that?The same can be asked of the Predator itself. At this point we've seen what the Predator can do, and this movie doesn't offer any new tricks. It looks the same, acts the same, and shamelessly rips itself off by copying the heat-vision POV (which is utilized randomly and pointlessly here), as well as the mask removal scene. They even reuse the 'ugly motherf@#$er' line. The movie would have been better served if the antagonist was a new variant of the Predator with some new tricks up its sleeve, à la the 2010 sequel Predators.Like the first film, Predator 2 has some character issues. Replacing the always enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger is Danny Glover, who makes a horrendous protagonist. He is constantly angry, overly violent, and completely unlikeable, and is just not believable as an action hero. The rest of the underdeveloped cast is just as bad, relying either on forced exposition to describe characters or painfully obvious archetype clichés to develop them. We hear about how much of a hero Glover's character is even though this is never demonstrated, and about his longtime friendship with his police partner, though this is never proved in their interactions. At one point, a female cop grabs a flirting Bill Paxton by the family jewels and threatens him to leave her alone. Okay, we get it; she's a strong and independent woman who doesn't take crap from anyone. There were many better ways to show it. Ultimately, you won't remember any of these characters ten minutes after you finish the movie.Put all these factors together and you get a severe lack of entertainment. While the first film was riveting and intense, this one is just an unremarkable bore. The story was lame and unwanted, the Predator itself is now derivative, and the characters are pathetic. The best thing about it was the musical score, and of course it was ripped straight from the original. The most interesting thing this movie had to offer was the possibility of a crossover with another classic sci-fi monster (and we all know how that eventually turned out). Don't waste your time with the lackluster Predator 2. I give it 2 out of 10 stars.",Predator 2

288,deathadder-13878,Rushed and busy,5,3 July 2016,"After the unexpected success of part 1, Fox to no one's surprise green lit a sequel. Rather arrogantly not wanting to make a movie on Arnold's terms, Fox slapped together a contrived sequel without Arnold. What little chance this sequel had to equal the original is obliterated without him.The original was a very macho, tribal movie. An almost ridiculously rugged (but likable) cast faces off against a powerful monster in the jungle. This time with no Arnold, the cast is more generic and the tone is more ""urban"" or ""edgy"". Part 1 is a product of Reagan, Part 2 the product of the rather confused state of pop culture in 1989-1991, when the 80's were dying but the 90's weren't established yet. More PC too, what with just one of the four main cops being a white guyPlot? A ""futuristic"" version of 1997 L.A. (the weapons are a bit more tricked out, the subway has gotten more popular, the clothes and hair styles mostly in keeping with very late 80's fashion) is beset by a nasty heat wave and drug fueled crime waves. Danny Glover is a maverick cop dealing with smarmy superiors and sleazy reporters. Along for the ride are his fellow cops: A butch lady officer, a forgettable Hispanic guy, and Bill Paxton overdoing his cocky poseur shtick that worked much better in Aliens. He's hardly the only one overdoing it here; virtually everyone is, though the bombastic and vulgar script, and the movie's overall manic feel probably make the actor's performances seem even worse.The Predator starts off by killing criminals. The action is pretty well shot, violent too though the MPAA apparently toned it down. But we don't really care since they're just generic criminals. The original wisely had the Predator killing American soldiers from the get-go. Eventually the cops realize that something ain't right about the killings, with the Hispanic cop retrieving the Predator's harpoon type blade from the crime scene. The FBI's closing in, too. Glover meets the head of the FBI unit (Gary Busey, giving a typical performance that I found entertaining) while the FBI is planning a trap. Lure the Predator to a controlled warehouse in which the Predator's infrared won't work. Glover watches on closed circuit monitors as Busey and his team attempt to capture the monster. It's a steal from Aliens, with each guy's suit outfitted with a camera to capture their POV as they're picked off one by one while a shell shocked superior goes numb. This director is no James Cameron, though, as the scene has about 1/10 the suspense that the Aliens scene had.Glover chases the Predator throughout the city. Some good stunts, the make-up work on the monster holds up pretty well as we get to see a lot of in the last 20-30 minutes. They should've spared us the lame humor involving naive bystanders, though. The Predator makes his way back to his mother ship that's hidden below the city. Glover soldiers on. Here we see an attempt to match the first film's showdown. It just doesn't work this time. In the first, Arnold barely won in spite of his muscles and his traps, against a wounded Predator. Somehow Glover, after furiously chasing the Predator to his HQ and having no time to prepare, successfully fends off Predator 2.0 with the help of a Pred. disc weapon which presumably would be a clumsy weapon in the hands of a normally built man. Other Predators suddenly appear, impressed by Glover's cunning. They spare Glover who must frantically escape the area as the ship blasts off.What reason does this have for existing? The characters are largely shrill stereotypes, the setting doesn't really make much sense. ""The Predator's attracted to heat and disorder."" Why?. And much of the Earth is hot and violent. What makes L.A. special? I guess you could be cynical and assume that the writers were lambasting SoCal by saying that it's so wretched it would attract killer aliens. Besides, setting it in an urban area requires contrivances to keep the Predator near the cast. L.A.'s a big place, how come Glover and his buddies keep running into the Predator? The movie takes on a very episodic, check-off-the-boxes feel. Whereas the original felt like a ride that gradually gained speed and momentum.I'll give a 5 for technical merits (good stunts, make-up, and adequate photography/editing/music). But it's basically a cash-in, and Fox should've waited for and listened to Arnold.",Predator 2

It's not the first, but it's OK.Does a good job of building suspense around a creature we've already seen, with the increased gore quota, new weapons, and the Black Ops plot etc. It furthers the franchise mythos quite well.Unfortunately the budget/ rushed production schedule/ Stephen Hopkins inexperience as a director show through. For example, the end fight is a bit of mess. To sell the idea of Harrigan playing possum, i'd have included a shot of Harrigan dropping the disc before he falls to his kness, so it's a surprise to us (and the Pred) when he has it in his hand and stabs old dreadlock head. But what do I know? It's also a shame some of the spider-man type stuff, with the pred jumping from building to building, car to car, in a shopping mail etc didn't make it in for production reasons Cast is OK, with Danny Glover playing against type, and it just about works.",Predator 2

That he also takes out most of the rest of the cast too, is just a bonus.The original had pace, style, suspense and a cast you cared about. This has none of those.

Mike (Danny Glover), is a cop who tries the clean the streets that are infested with drugs and gangs but when mysterious deaths occur among gangs and a fellow cops, Mike is drawn to the case. Not knowing that a predator roams the streets of LA Mike digs deep into the mysterious deaths but Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) a government investigator, intervenes and is pushing Mike out. As Mike is losing more fellow officers, its becomes a personal war but he doesn't know where or who the killer is. When more evidence surfaces up and more deaths occur, Mike is after the killer but Keyes deviates the plan and introduces Mike to their hunt, a hunt for Predator.

This film tried new things and worked but because people don't like some scenes, one bad review and apparently it makes it have a six point three rating, if people watched this again and critics weren't so picky and duldged themselves into the plot a bit more then they would maybe enjoy more. Really this film should be at least a 6.5, a maximum of 7.2.

299,Pizzaburn,"A progression, not just more of the same..",7,25 January 1999,"Predator 2 is an excellent sequel to the original, but only if you saw the original and understood what it was about. Plot points in the original suggest that the Predator is from a more advanced culture than ours..not only technologically, but also their games. He's on holiday, hunting  for trophies, using a Bushido-like code of honor.A lot of this backstory was covered well in some very successful graphic novels. They served to amuse the faithful, but failed to bring the rest of us up to speed. This leaves too much detail hidden from the audience as Danny Glover tries to piece together what he's up against (and makes his conclusions harder to reach).It appears that the director has seen those helpful expositions, or he was able to infer them from the original movie. Either way, the action is too diffcult to follow the first time around unless you know the Predator already. Once you see the ending, you have enough info to go back and enjoy the film the next time.The movie is true to the source material, but not true to the audience.

When he THINKS he knows what makes the Predator tick, the Predator shows the audience who's the boss in this movie.The story is a bit thin, and plays on the cult-status of Predator (1) , but the movie manages to portray the feeling of fear better than Predator (1).More high-tech weapons, more action, more stalking in ""familiar"" surroundings, more more more. This movie has it all... More suspence than action (YEY!!!).I gave this movie a 7...",Predator 2
301,G-Crusher,This movie was cool.,10,13 July 2000,Okay I saw this movie in a local video store and a friend said I should see it.  I did.  It was a blast to see. This movie while it didn't make as much money as the original explored more of the Predator's background than the original did.  The Predator also sported more weaponry than Predator did. Also it showed the Predator's ship and that they live in clans.  Although number one had more action I believe that this film shouldn't be overlooked.,Predator 2

303,NGcs,Predator in different surroundings is still just as menacing,7,14 April 2012,"I not only think this is a worthy sequel, but it is in many aspects even better than the first Predator (1987). Comparing them would be pointless, obviously the first the great one, setting the standard for the sequel, but in my opinion Stephen Hopkins does a great work adjusting the theme to his own taste and in terms of setting the mood and atmosphere, he even surpasses the original. I understand many people didn't like the fact that it didn't take place in the jungle, that the mood is now not only mysterious but also gritty, but in my opinion it is only for the better, the slaughterhouse district is a suitable choice for the intelligent extraterrestrial skull-collector to reside. Predator 2 focuses much more on Predator, and has a lot less character development, the acting is noticeably worse, and you don't get memorable witty comments from Danny Glover, or classic funny one-liners like ""get to the choppa'!"" from Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first, you do however see a much more diverse set of scenery, which are always very much connecting to the original theme. I personally really liked the final fight in the catacomb-looking tomb, but the rooftop scenes are also noteworthy. This sequel is criminally underrated, I however, recommend it.",Predator 2
304,obsidian_guardian,makes predators look pathetic,3,17 April 2012,"I will never understand why people find this movie better than Alien vs. Predator. This movie completely demeans the Predator in multiple ways. First off, Arnold was barely able to kill this thing in the first movie, even when he had like six other military guys helping him out, and yet somehow Danny Glover is able to single-handedly kill this thing? I don't think so! Secondly, the Predator's face looks so fake in this movie. The Predator's face looks like something out of one of the Gremlin movies. I don't understand how they went from making a creature that looks so realistic to making it look so cheesy. Also, the fact that a drug lord apparently knows about this alien makes no sense. Not to mention the fact that the Predator tried to activate its bomb while neither him nor Danny were seriously injured makes the Predator seem like a real wuss. And the fact that the Predator got shot multiple times in the subway without so much as flinching, and yet when Danny shoots it the Predator nearly dies apparently. Need I go on?

I always try to underestimate a film so that I can be pleasantly surprised afterwards when it turns out to be surprisingly entertaining. But never in my life would I have thought my low expectations would be shattered to a million pieces by this sequel. The original was quite good, this was not.Had I watched this film alone, I would have turned it off 20 minutes into film, but thankfully a friend and I were laughing our a**es off at the idiocy of the supporting characters, the dialogue, and the goofy action sequences. Good time all around, but for all the wrong reasons.This film doesn't contain one character I like, let alone someone I can endure, their all so incredibly two dimensional and annoying with all their one liners and the random use of swear words, that movie sure was ""hardcore"". Perhaps the one person this film could've have done without was that tough female cop, a cop that has nothing much more to add than to emphasize the obvious and look pi**ed off, to which we later find out she is pregnant, but never hear from her again.

Luckily, it moves on to the stereotypical Jamaican drug gangs ... and doesn't get much better.Funnily enough, as I was watching the movie, I was thinking -- wow, this predator guy never kills chicks. It looks like women are the new dogs of Hollywood (because nobody lost money adding a scene in post where the dog makes it out alive). Not that I feel patronised ... OK, I do.Anyway, it turns out that the predator doesn't kill pregnant chicks. Now, I understand that hunters have some sort of code about that, you know, not killing female deer during Spring or something. This is presumably so that there are more deer to kill next year (how sweet). But consider, there are six billion humans on the planet, I really doubt that the predator gives a crap.Anyway, there are many problems with this movie (e.g. you need a certain level of manliness to have your gunfire injure the bad guy), and few redeeming features.

The time travelling predator idea is way awesome....imagine no magnums etc etc to finish off the pred, that would be so cool. I'd also love to see more Predator anime movies as they can go where films can't (due to constraints on effects and budget).

309,hiwatt,biggest stinky c**p,1,18 January 2000,"This movie plain sucks. I am a really big fan the original predator, but this movie is junk compared to it. This movie totally undermines the whole principal of the predator. The predator is a hunter, not a mass murderer. He doesn't go around killing everyone he can, he picks choice kills and hunts them. Why did he kill all those people in the subway? Who knows? He didn't even take trophies of them. The scene with Keys when he tries to capture the predator is totally predictable, woo, i wonder whats gonna happen. Maybe his whole team will get killed by the predator. Hmm, its a real toughy. Then we get the predator running into some apartment, crushing some wall tiles, and making some kind of healing substance. Is there something i dont know about wall tiles? or have they always had medicinal properties? Maybe its a pred thing. Then comes the ending scene, which totally baffled me. Danny Glover survives a fall down a elevator shaft, and ends up in a predator ship that somehow got into a underground tunnel. Well, how in the hell did the predators manage to get a ship into a tunnel in the middle of a city with no one noticing? Anyways, danny starts beating up a predator which has killed about 50 people through the movie with ease, but some how now has trouble killing danny, whose gotten his butt kicked throughout the  entire movie. Well *surprisingly* danny glover kills the predator, when all of a sudden.. a bunch of other predators appear. They seem to have no problem with the fact that one of their buddies just died, because they dont do squat to him, besides giving him some old gun, which makes no sense at all. What does this old gun symbolize? I have no idea. Well danny decides its time to leave, so he jumps out, and we have almost the exact same ending as predator, only in a city setting. Everything in this movie is pretty bad. The predator couldnt hold a stick up to the one in the original, he just doesnt have the same amount of skill. The jamacian drug lords are laughable stereotypes, pot smoking, rastafarian, pimps with uzis. Danny Glover is the typical cop who cant stay out of trouble, with his rag tag posse of cops who all manage to get killed. I want to know why in every sci fi movie, they always have to have some scientist who wants to try and capture or make peace with some monster who has killed countless numbers of people. I have to agree with the person who was talking about danny glovers pants. They are freakin hilarious. At least 2 sizes too  big and drooping all over. Everything in this movie stinks. Dont see it. Its got every hollywood cliche all rolled into one movie. Stay far away from this movie.",Predator 2

It also greatly expanded the Predator universe and franchise. It introduced a whole new bunch of Pred weapons, tactics and behavior which never ever seemed out of place and were perfect fits. It explored their race further. All these were added to full effect in the AvP and AvP-2 PC games which were smash hits so imagine how horrible it would be if this movie never happened? The urban (steel jungle?) setting contrasts against the previous jungle setting and is a major plus for this movie. This movie was also extremely realistic and gory.

314,Hot_Wheels,Even better than the original!,9,23 June 2002,"Seeing how this movie has been rated, I can't help but think that it's been very overlooked simply because Arnold Schwarzenegger passed it over. But Predator 2 does not suffer from that absence in the least, and in many ways it surpasses its predecessor. While the original was very exciting and action packed, (with not a few over-the-top one-liners) it wasn't particularly story driven. Pred 2 offers much more insight into the Predators as an alien race, but still keeps them an intriguing mystery. And with the fanbase and wide open storyline, it's a real pity they haven't made a third sequal.The streets of L.A. make for a great setting in this perfectly paced film, and all the actors fit there roles very well, with the one exception being Gary Busey, who seems to be totally out of his element playing government agent Peter Keyes. Everything else in this film is nearly perfect, with a simple but well thought-out script, very good special effects, and not a few hanged and skinned bodies.

Danny Glover was decent as the lead role and could be funny from time to time, but the best character for me was King Willie. In the little screen time he had he was brilliant, his stand off with the Predator is the best scene in the whole film. Still, it lacked really likable characters unlike the first film that had Billy and Blaine who were just such badasses. Big arnie is missed here also as the cigar smoking army general. But the cast in this film wasn't exactly weak, other than the mighty King Willie, Lt.Keyes played by Gary Busey was a solid character, as he always is.

The story was good and exciting to watch. However, there are so many things wrong with this movie, by the end I was screaming at the scream 'Just die!' as in my opinion it would f made a better ending.It's the little things that made the movie such a let down, such as: In the sex scene, the Jamaicans burst though the door and it takes the people having sex five seconds to realize they are there and too the massive crash. When the woman gets strangled by the predator, how the hell did she survive? The predator wold not of just left her there after only getting the job half done? When the predator is holding onto Mike's arm when he is hanging off of the roof, how did Mike stay on the building because he was not holding onto the building and the predator must of weighed a ton. Mike cannot die, no one could survive an explosion like that, take on and kill a predator, drive into a gang of armed drug lords hanging out of the car door and live to tell the tale. Why didn't the predators kill Mike when they had the chance, instead they let him live and gave him a pistol from the 1700's. This confused me and ruined the film even more for me. The reference to alien with the skulls was not necessary as the movie 'Alien vs. Predator' had not been made yet.

And all the characters were annoying, even the Predator went overline with too much talking. Not even Danny ""im too old for this s**t"" Glover could save this sorry excuse for a movie. And get this, they use a perfectly good line from the first movie ""your one ugly..."". Please. Go home and get a better script people.Why they handed this task to some nobody who had only directed two films(one of them known for possibly being the worst Freddy Krueger movie) is a mystery.

It has everything that makes a film an 18, tonnes of gore, tonnes of swearing and tonnes of strong nudity. But i don't care, because this is such an amazing film. It's hard to describe what a breakthrough this was when it was released. The Predator is an alien who hunts other beings for sport, it can turn invisible and has an incredible arsenal. The original Predator had about ten people in it, but it didn't matter. This film has tonnes of actors including the amazing Danny Glover and its still as good if not better then the Shwarzennegger original. If you want a gory, sexy, sweary and action packed film that's for the male majority only really, get the double edition DVD; this includes both films.

While the first film was indeed a masterpiece, I think this one just clinches it, apart from anything else, because of the variety of funky weapons this Predator uses.  It makes the action scenes much more interesting to watch, as he continually pulls out different weapons for each of his prey. Also, Kevin Peter Hall puts across a surprisingly deep performance for such a violent creature.  All too often, monster bad-guys are all ""Grr, Argh"" and show very little intelligence, but this boy is smart. Of course, this movie inconspicuously links to that other great Sci-fi saga, the 'Alien' films, by showing the skull of an Alien drone in the Predator's trophy room.  It's only glimpsed twice in the movie, but provides the only on-screen basis for the 'Aliens vs. Predator' franchise.

And now I know why that is.If you think you get the same experience as the first, you'll get so disappointed. I can't recommend any watching it. It's a total waste of time.",Predator 2
326,g_radek,I don't think he gives a s**t,7,26 December 2003,"Each time I have just watched Predator 2 I feel like watching Predator, but I never wanna see Predator 2 having just watched Predator . Strange? The sequel's really great, but lacks this morbid atmosphere of the original. It's nice to see new Predator's weaponary like a disk or a net and improved tools for curing his wounds, but it will never beat Predator.",Predator 2
327,reddragonman1,Predator 2...best movie EVER!!!,8,1 March 2007,"Most think that the original surpasses this movie in every aspect, but for the fools who believe in that assumption, you will be hunted down and gutted like a fish. This movie is amazing, with cool action scenes, great acting, awesome predator scenes, realistic makeup, and all crammed into one movie, and if it had anymore greatness, I think the T.V would explode. Even though Arnie isn't in this one, who could be a better replacement than Danny Glover? No one.The one thing that makes this movie better than the original is the fact that there are TONS of scenes with the Predator in them. Unlike the first, where it takes the predator FOREVER to show up, you get a glimpse of him right off the bat, which is what makes this movie pimplishly cool. The only reason this movie gets a nine, instead of a ten, is the scene where those two random people were having very violent sex. That scene was very freakish. I mean, these two people are doing it, and then suddenly all of these Jamaican gangtas come in and tie the guy up by his ankles and cut his heart out, and in the midst of all this, the predator decides to show up.What is he doing in there, besides killin' him some gangstas? It makes no sense. Anyway, it's a good movie. Watch it, and be amazed.",Predator 2
328,godzillaman631,Awesome directing.,10,11 May 2013,"The Predator franchise is one of my favorite franchises to date from the Arnie Predator to Adrein Brody in Predators. This movie stars Danny Glover as Lt Mike Harrigan in a 'futuristic' Los Angelis, for 1990 it was the future of 1997. The streets are overrun with two gangs the Colombians and the Jamicans. These gangs fight for control of the city and the police are outmanned and out gunned. Ifthat is not enough for a movie then a new slick Predator shows up and kicks there butts. The use of never showing clear view of the Predator until later in the movie is amazing. The director Stephen Hopkins makes great use of lighting and fast cuts to make this one of the best scifi/horror/action movies ever. 10/10 watch it.",Predator 2
329,johnnymc_67,Door swings both ways??,6,19 April 2005,"This was never going to live up to the original.The first film,being the master piece that it was,would never have been as popular as it is if Arnold had not being apart of it.So in this movie we have to settle for Danny Glover!Why him?He spends the whole film prancing around in his old man pants looking very old age pensioner like.The Predator,being the main star,is given some major screen time.The predator design can't be faulted,he looks amazing.His spear is his only problem,its too big and bulky to be used by an efficient killing machine.The plot.....now here is where we kinda fall off the wagon.In theory its a solid enough idea.The predator is drawn to LA by the heat wave and conflict between the police,the Jamacions and the Colombians.The predator spends no time in dealing with the Colombians,next up are the Jamacians in a pretty thrilling sequence of events.Then Mr Glover's friend buys the farm and Mr Glover takes it upon himself to find the killer.you can probably guess the rest.There's a pretty decent subway sequence,and a very ""Aliens"" like Slaughter house sequence.Then the film plummets into a lack of ideas.a cat and mouse chase scene takes place to kill some time before arriving at the predators space ship which looks as if it was thrown up on a sound stage in about five minutes.overall its OK.The acting is nothing special.The plot runs out of ideas and there's a cameo from an alien",Predator 2

I love Eurotrip and Ace Ventura, buy I KNOW they arent the best movies ever.The acting in this movie is probably up there on the top of mount rushmore for bad acting.Some people say worthy sequel, or better than the first one, don't blame blind people for having an opinion.. Donald Glover with a big toy gun, and I think he might be two months pregnant, is now the TOP PREDATOR after freakin Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team of commando's? F outta here. I never thought I'd say this, but Arnold can act circles around Glover and that says a whole lot.Don't get me wrong, there is an audience for movies like this. I enjoy watching a bad movie from time to time, but when I saw the reviews over here, I had too say something. This movie is a 10.. So what is the godfather then, at best its on the same level as this for those people?! F OUTTA HERE!!So, yeah..",Predator 2

333,plissken-85800,Predator 2,10,23 September 2015,"Well, I never understand why this movie wasn't a hit when it released in 1990. Why lot of people said it was a bad idea to brought a Predator in the city? Big cities aren't as jungle-like? And because of the Predator do what he do to have hunting trophies, which better place than a metropolis as L.A? Some complains Schwarzenegger decline his part...And then? Predator's movie is about...Predator, first! So, atmosphere isn't the same also because in the first one it was about few men and Predator 2 is about...all people from L.A. I liked when I seen first time and I like yet today for same reasons: action package,new weapons,bad ass acting of Danny Glover (opposite job he had on Lethal Weapon series), gory scenes, alien skull, subtext Predators went on Earth since at least 200 years ago... Directing from Stephen Hopkins is nice and warm (Elm Street 5, Ghost and Darkness, Judgment Night...), score from Alan Silvestri's amazing, SFX are great, set design from Lawrence G. Paull are cute...About sets, one scene tortured me since last 23 years. It when Predator raised skull while lightning, on a top of a building with golden eagles head. Because I loved N.Y.C since...ever actually,eagles head remind me it was sculptures from Chrysler Building. But the movie depict is located in L.A. So I was very confused about this architectural item and couldn't understand why Chrysler Building was shown in this L.A movie. Now, I know it's because the first script should be located in N.Y.C and because of financial aspects, J&J Thomas (writers)changed location of shooting. I guess Chrysler Bg set was made (and shot) before writers relocated action on CA. In a word or 100, don't watch Predator 2 as a ""mirror sequel"" but as a kind of variation of the first one.",Predator 2
334,ruthiemckinnon,does what you want,9,9 September 2006,"this movie came at the end of 2 weeks going through all the alien films and then AVP. i remembered predator2 vaguely from when i was a kid. but back then it was all about arnie. thinking it couldn't be worse than AVP i picked it up to finish off all those series of films....and its really good. my expectations were low, but this turned out to be exactly what it should be. wasn't too serious, had good action. great score and was well cast. danny glover isn't arnie, but he was born to play bitter rule breaking hero cops. from the quotable lines ('f**kin voodoo magic')to the gun wielding commuters in the subway, the film delivers what it should. in the days of disappointing franchise whoring (AVP I'm looking at you), predator is worth another look.",Predator 2
335,mglover1981,Awesome Action Movie,8,8 January 2020,"First of all, there is no Arnie which is actually fine as I'm not sure how he would have fitted into this movie (and I'm a huge Arnie fan).
Secondly, I'm not sure why this movie gets so much hate for not being ""realistic"", it's a movie about an alien hunting humans for trophies after all!!!
Thirdly and lastly, Danny Glover does a great job as the lead, he's a no nonsense get the job done cop who doesn't like taking orders, this sounds cliche but would a play by the rules cop be able to take on a predator? Errr no! Great movie with plenty of entertaining scenes.",Predator 2
336,tommy-logie,Get to the sofa....,8,3 January 2008,"the first time when i saw Predator 2 (years ago),i wasn't totally satisfied. It starts out very cool with the gang-war and everything. But then Danny shows up. And that was a bad idea. I mean they had Bill Paxton(Game over man). If they just put him in charge i think it would turned out better. But hey thats just the only thing i lacked on predator 2.For the rest the movie is suppa. Nice action shots. The Pred is awesome , with the new weaponry and stuff. the scene where he throws his disc that slashes the cadavers and finally separates that human... gabba gabba. The scene where he heals himself...jep there is cool stuff in the movie.And of course the ending in the trophy-room where you see the glimpse of the alien skull... i loved that. So for those who want check out the series go rent Predator 1&2 and if you want to go all the way you MUST rent Alien and Aliens. Get to the Sofa----->surround on extreme and prepare for the ride of your life mwoehahahahahaha",Predator 2
337,hellfire_80,Not being as good as the first doesn't stop it from being fun!,8,20 February 2008,"Brett Ratner, Renny Harlin, Chuck Russell...studio directors. They make the movies that don't have the 'directed by...' tag line at the end of the trailer or TV spots. Movie nerds know 'em and typically, we hate 'em. They are on the front lines of the b-grade genre crap with a-grade budgets we complain about all the time, directors for hire. And amongst them: Stephen Hopkins, who has consistently given me the most entertainment out of the crappy movies he's made.Let's make things clear, Predator 2 is most definitely NOT better than it's previous film. The first film was a bare bones story made interesting by the expert direction by John McTeirnan, who ratcheted the tension up to then unheard of levels by sheer skill. He knew that GOOD action was always about the ANTICIPATION. Predator 2 however is a different beast.It's loud, in your face, and with more bits added on. It's dumber, with horrible(-y great) dialog and two dimensional characters wasting the talents of Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, and countless other unusually high profile actors. But that doesn't matter, this is a genre sequel, it's not about the talky-talky or character development, it's about the ACTION! And THIS is where we get to Stephen. He saves the film from what could've been a horrible nightmare of a flick. The guy knows how to stage a scene and make it interesting, and he keeps the film going at a quick pace so you don't have time to really think about the dumb parts, while still keeping it reigned in so things that NEED to make sense DO. The presentation of the Predator himself is actually one of the few things he did BETTER than the original. THIS movie's Predator knows how to make an entrance! And the action set pieces are exciting and expertly done (and makes ya pine for the days when an action scene was actually STAGED and DIRECTED and not just shot with a shaky camera). Simply put, it's a well shot movie.And that's what I've noticed this guy does. Predator 2, Ghost and the Darkness, Blown Away, Judgment Night. These aren't good 'films', but they're GREAT 'flicks'. They're fun and exciting, even if they aren't too bright. They're flaws skillfully overcome by the direction, something that I've yet to see Renny or Brett pull off.Now if you go into this movie LOOKING for something bad about it, you won't have to look far and it'll be a terrible experience for you. But if all you want is a good time and nothing else, you won't be disappointed.",Predator 2
338,beryl-rae,Sparing Pregnant women in or out of Character.,9,26 February 2008,"Have seen Predator 2 three times on channel 4 and now own it. Disagree that sparing pregnant Police Officer was out of character after all they are intelligent beings and one assumes have strict rules regarding who or what they hunt. They spared a female from the first film because she was unharmed. No the actions are in keeping with supposedly intelligent races although our own leaves a lot to be desired. One thing though where is the economy to support all this technology? We need to know more about their home world and civilisation obviously they are at the hub at a vast trading network. Having seen other Predator films including 'Alien vs Predator (the first one). Their technology seems to change slightly from film to film. Either these are continuity mistakes or we are supposed to be seeing the result of scientific progress. We also know little about what they. The fact that one visits a slaughter house does not mean they live off raw meat, certainly not frozen, especially since they seem to carry their own version of a Bunsen burner and flame in that all purpose wrist device. We know also they have an automated medical centre on their ships. This seems a direct rip-off from Star Trek in some ways. What would be a great future film if they got some of the original Start Trek writers to work on a Predator film perhaps we might see some fleshing out of these intriguing aliens and not Manga style gore.",Predator 2
339,wasamic,OK movie but some of the language was SO unnecessary,3,14 February 2009,"Well this movie was good for action but the story was @@@! OK the predator in this movie say ""#@@ happens,Danny,$$%#k,mother %$,damn, and keep it,Um you think that is enough I mean holy crap. Even the people cussed allot I like cussing in movies but when @#$# is said every 3 seconds there is a problem...a big one some times you want to see some serious dialog with out foul language. Like in star wars did Luke say %$#@ when he got his @!%$ hand chopped off no and that was so much better than this !@@. But Danny did a good job acting but i really think Arnold could have been in this and it wouldn't have been as bad. The acting from the female cop was the worst I have ever seen in a film in a long time, but its a good action film so go see it.",Predator 2
340,angusmustdie,A good B movie worthy of surviving the test of time,7,19 January 2013,"Believe it or not, I actually prefer this movie over the original title. While watching Arnie deliver one liner puns that you'd expect to hear from your own father is always delightful, I find that Predator 2 had more depth. Danny Glover had a more interesting character, with some funny one liners of his own. And seeing Bill Paxton in a movie is always a treat, as he always has the best and funniest deaths, yet you like his character enough to root for him anyway.I really like the expansion on the Predator Culture, you can really compare them to the Klingons, but with movie production costumes and arsenal.The sense of mystery these creatures have will keep one awake at night looking at the stars just imagining.All in all Predator 2 is no masterpiece of film making. But it is a solid action movie, that deserves it's spot in the Predator Franchise.",Predator 2

Big Mistake,3,16 January 2005,"Great movie made about a stealthy alien hunter that only takes on the best of warriors of whatever planet or race that it encounters. Predator starring Arnie a great SciFi action flick. so inevitably a sequel was going to be made. now who to star? Arnie not available/ didn't want to. hmm Stallone maybe ? oh wait I KNOW Danny glover!an ageing black guy who's co star in the lethal weapon series only did another sequel because glover needed the money. for god's sake the guy has to stop between take for an hour to catch his breath again. was Samuel l. busy? hell i'd have preferred will smith play rather than Danny ""im getting too old for this S***"" Glover.so fans of predator prepare for a disappointment Arnie beating the creature was barely plausible. Danny glover fighting one should be a foregone conclusion. but maybe the predator was an ageing out of work hunter? still its not bad. it could have been worse it could have been as bad as alien resurrection.",Predator 2
343,GarryAbernethy,"great film, lacks the panache of the first, but as a stand alone movie, it delivers on intrigue, good cinematography and suspense",10,10 March 2005,"the first film was a cracker, with great characters, and action and suspense throughout. it was a refreshing idea and a great action film, and in someways the second title creaked under the pressure and expectations brought about from the 1st. it lacks vivid characters, and is like a poor take on the original, set in LA to give it the excuse of being different. however i believe it is by far the superior film of the two, containing much more depth than predator 1, and a cracking dark storyline to boot. the predator in the city could not be more lavishly produced, the cinematography is superb, and the city is as much a part of the film as the predator. the ending sequence is s brutally simple yet deeply engrossing and satisfying, a superb movie, that like alien 3, fell to thick, brainless action freaks who loved the movie before. both alien 3 and predator 2 are superb dark gripping dramas that are not to be missed",Predator 2
344,lezboss-85436,If you loved the original!,9,22 July 2021,"Truly a great sequel that you rarely get too see. Yes, of course there are flaws 'Alien sculls' for instance and it is in a different genre of style to the original but it's the closest thing we've had to it even till now the year or 2021. Cast was great, setting somehow worked really well considering the original. It still has as similar feel to the original, the predator especially, still as cool and possibly even more menacing but with more on screen time that works and witb an expanded weapons arsenal which honestly is iconic and feels real in terms of what tech the race would have. It is really a super dark 90s scifi horror flick in the likes of split second, with great memorable characters and lines, mixed in 90s comedy that somehow works with Paxton and Glover and heavy on in the gore aspect. Still in 2021 the greatest ominous alien species and threat ever created on screen... yes Alien is also amazing but Predator is something else... a superior race that is far more advanced... and hunt other species for sport. Predator 2 still holds up as easily the best and only other Predator movie that can be respected as a Predator movie or sequel related to the original in my opinion. Watch it! And watch it again as I have more times than I can count... but not near as many as the original 😉",Predator 2

A falta de um bom roteiro, que resulta em actores a fazer papeis de um bando de personagens clichés, com a personalidade bastante forçada. A cidade, apesar de parecer uma boa ideia, o predador dentro de um ambiente povoado da cidade metropolitana, só resulta na perda de suspense e da vibe que o primeiro trazia com o silêncio inquieto da selva.
Para resumir, atores promissores mas com falta de um bom roteiro, cenas desnecessárias que não acrescentam nada ao filme e a perda de identidade do original predador.",Predator 2

The good thing about this movie is that you actually get to see the predator more than you do in the first movie. Although i think the first movie was quite a bit better than the second but if you haven't seen it i recommend you do also seeing the new weapons and gadgets was great but the smart disc was just a bit over the top as the predator threw it, it didn't even spin in the air, and being able to see cables as the predator is falling down the side of the building, but other than that the movie was great and i give an 8/10, and as you watch the movie have a good look in the trophy case.",Predator 2
