0,TheLittleSongbird,A blockbuster that takes a bigger approach and with brains and heart,8,20 July 2014,"As someone who really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, expectations were high for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. And apart from a rushed ending and the underdeveloped human characters Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't disappoint and is just as good. It looks amazing for starters, the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and atmosphere and the scenery is equally striking. But the visual highlight, and most likely the best thing about the film, are the special effects for the apes, that they look so real and that it's hard to believe they were done by computer is testament to how good they look. The soundtrack is haunting and rousing with no dirge-like tempos and it doesn't feel overbearing either, even with sound with as much authenticity as here. The script also impresses, it's very intelligently done and has a lot of tension and heart. What impressed even more was how simple and nuanced some of it was, like when the apes speak they only need to say a few words and it still feels like it's saying a lot, a couple of times even a sideways glance brings more impact than you'd think. The story takes a bigger and somewhat bolder approach than Rise of the Planet of the Apes and this is an instance of it working very well, especially with the visceral action sequences which are very tense and look terrific and in the incredibly intense and emotional final act. It's compelling stuff where you feel compassion for and identify with every step of the way with Caesar and his family. Matt Reeves' direction doesn't make the mistake of being overblown or lethargic, there is at least a sense that he knows what he's doing. The acting is solid, Jason Clarke and Keri Russell are charming leads and Gary Oldman while criminally underused still gives a spirited performances. But other than the special effects the other highlight is the characterisation of the apes, which is just superb especially for Caesar(who is by far and way the most relatable and most compelling character in the entire film), Andy Serkis never fails to amaze me. All in all a really well done blockbuster, although the human characters do not register anywhere near as well as the special effects and the apes characterisations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
1,Leofwine_draca,Too worthy for its own good,4,27 February 2017,"DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the latest in the long-running franchise, following on from the reboot RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. This one was directed by CLOVERFIELD's Matt Reeves and features a mostly different cast to the first, albeit retaining Andy Serkis as the chief chimp Caesar. This time around the action is on a much larger scale, depicting a constant running state of warfare between surviving humanity and the organised primates.It's a very different beast to the first movie, set in a post-apocalyptic world enhanced by CGI effects. And the CGI is the main thing you'll take away from this film, which features some truly fantastic work; the motion capture in particular is quite brilliant and the main apes are the best I've ever seen. They've come a long way from Gollum all those years back. Even the eyes are beginning to look realistic, which is saying something.The rest of the story is a mixed bag. There are some good actors in the mix, including Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman, but the whole thing feels a bit too messy, a bit too grand and overwhelmed in CGI spectacle at the expense of depth. Me, I'm not too keen on CGI action scenes and these are typical for the format: explosive, fast-paced, and never involving. The script isn't as good as it should be, and the overlong running time gives the whole movie a sluggish feel at times. What you're left with is a comic book-style movie about humanised apes which is far too serious and would-be worthy for its own good.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
2,SnoopyStyle,You'll believe an ape can talk.,8,23 April 2015,Human civilization collapses after the spread of the Simian Flu and worldwide fighting. The Apes that escaped from the Gen-Sys have formed a thriving colony of super smart apes under the leadership of Caesar in northern California. A group of humans led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) encounter them which turns deadly. Carver kills one of the apes. There is a large human community gathered in the remains of San Francisco led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman). They need to restart the generating station but it's located near the ape home. Malcolm has girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee). He goes to negotiate with the apes while Dreyfus prepares for war. Meanwhile Ceasar is challenged by Koba.The realism achieved with the ape characters is terrific. They are almost human and distinguishable from each other. The story is compelling. The most interesting thing is that this is more of an ape movie. The apes have some of the most interesting roles. Clarke leads the human contingent competently. Oldman adds a little gravitas. This is a great sequel to the surprisingly good 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'.,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
3,Hitchcoc,Did Anyone Ask How?,5,19 April 2016,"So we have a culture of apes and a post apocalypse group of humans. They live in San Francisco. They are trying to survive. The apes have evolved awfully fast to my thinking, having a functioning society where they communicate and build. Of course, the two forces eventually meet. All the clichés emerge, with the humans being fundamentally evil (well, the apes have their moments as well). There is all kinds of give and take, but prejudices take over and violence emerges, eventually leading to an upcoming war. One previous reviewer hit the nail on the head, however. If one asks any questions about what has emerged in the human camp, there are way too many crimes against reality. Everyone seems well fed and prosperous (although we are told supplies are running out). How are they getting enough food? What is their day to day purpose in life. They all seem to spend too much time grousing about things. Anyway, the animation and computer graphics are amazing. The apes are much more interesting than any of the humans. Unfortunately, a contrived story doesn't make up for the plot deficiencies.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
4,Prismark10,Bad dawn rising,3,12 November 2014,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes had intelligent storytelling which paid respect to the old Planet of the Apes franchise taken out of mothball. Just look at the way they set up the Charlton Heston film.Here with a new director it has all gone out of the window as they brush up a bad draft of a X Men film and sprinkle a little of the Lion King and Animal Farm. So you have a setting just 10 years after the Rise movie where Apes have become hyper intelligent and can even speak English even though they have been living in the woods just off San Francisco. They have started to build living quarters, they have domesticated horses and can even ride them.Humans have gone backwards thanks to a simian virus and joined the ranks of the homeless that currently populate San Francisco. They seem to be living in some closed off quarters struggling with power and heat, despite tribes in Africa, Asia and Australia have been living in the open land for thousands of years without issues and so have the apes in this movie, out in the cold forest just off San Francisco and they are advancing in brain power.Caesar is the alpha ape, The Professor Xavier of the movie. His right hand ape called Koba (which happened to be Stalin's nickname, hence the Animal Farm link) distrusts human, he is very much Magneto. When some humans turn up to the woods hoping to repair some old dam their presence causes distrust and tension within the ape community.However even the humans who spend their time whining are not solid. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) wants to reach out to the apes and work together. Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) does not see the Apes as a threat and think they can easily be dispensed with. Although no one notices that as a leader he seems not to have done a good job advancing the human race.Of course these prequels will lead to set up where the apes take over the world but it's rather clumsily done with Koba leading the pack. Ape may not kill ape but Koba rather does it openly. So some apes are worth more the other apes then and the apes do not seem to mind this. In fact Koba can ride a horse and fire guns from both hands at the same time. I am sure San Francisco has a law against hands free horse riding!Outside of the battle scenes at the latter part of the film this was more Yawn of the Apes as I struggled to get into this film mainly because I found the whole story absurd and the script laughable.So you have a party of humans having sensitive negotiations with the apes in the woods. You take with you a guy who hates apes, blames them for the Simian virus (even though the virus was man-made) and wants to wipe out the whole stinking lot off them. Nice move as you have a two dimensional character whose whole plot purpose is to upset some apes and therefore go to war with them.Technically the film is very good with the CGI apes that are more lifelike than some of the human cast who come across stiff or just plain dull, like they cannot believe some of the lines they have been asked to speak.The film is ponderous as it tries to follow on from the first film that was a surprise critical and box office hit. Despite the technical wizardry it is cliché ridden and formulaic.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
5,claudio_carvalho,Another Spectacular Prequel,8,30 November 2014,"Ten years after the worldwide pandemic of the deadly virus ALZ-113, the human civilization is completely destroyed. In San Francisco, Caesar has become the leader of evolved apes and has a son, Blue Eyes. When Blue Eyes and his friend Ash stumble with a group of humans under the command of Malcolm (Jason Clarke), there is a friction between them. However, Caesar orders the human to return to the derelict San Francisco City. Then he goes with a group of apes to the city to tell them to stay there since they do not want war against the human, despite the hatred of his second in command Koba against humans. However Malcolm returns alone to the woods to meet Caesar to explain that they need to repair the hydroelectric dam to recover power in the city to save the survivors. Caesar accepts his argument and let him work with his family and a few technicians in the dam. Meanwhile the leader of the humans Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) decides to arm the survivors since he does not believe in the apes. However Koba wants the war against mankind and he provokes a situation of intolerance and consequent confrontation. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is another spectacular prequel of the successful franchise of the late 60's and early 70's. It is impressive how well written this emotional adventure is, having well developed characters and situations. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Planeta dos Macacos: O Confronto"" (""Planet of the Apes: The Confrontation"")",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
6,nogodnomasters,Talking apes with bigass spears!,8,23 January 2018,"Roddy McDowall is now out of a job being replaced by a sexless CG ape. During the opening credits we quickly discover the ALZ 113 virus has killed off many humans creating a quarantine condition which for some unexplained reason caused rioting and killing off more humans. In spite of the weak plot point, it was more probable then the original dog/cat virus which lead to breeding apes with long gestation periods as pets.The film spends time building ape character with perfect English syntax subtitles. In this plot, our quarantined humans are running short on fuel and seek to restart a hydro-electric dam in ape territory and seem willing to go to war for oil, er ah, energy if need be. Koba, a neo-con ape, doesn't trust the humans and wants to have a first strike. (Koba was a nickname for Stalin.)Some of the initial soundtrack and imagery reminded me of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" with later scenes of cooperation reminiscent of the final film and TV series. There was nothing bad about the CG apes, except they got their money's worth from them. The ape on ape fighting was far too long, reminding me of that first Iron Man film.Okay, this film is done. I am ready for the film where women wear the Linda Harrison loin cloths.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
7,kosmasp,They get it right ... again,8,8 October 2014,"For a sequel to a remake this is exceptional good. The story (even if predictable at times) is nicely told. Everything shown makes sense. It expands the universe created by the ""first"" movie (even has some ""evidence"" of what happened then) and evolves. Although you could argue that some ""things"" devolve.For a science fiction movie, this really does put a lot of weight onto the characters and the general drama that situations can bring up. It also shows society, with all its good and bad sides. It's tough to ""control"" everybody or make them see reason. Unfortunately this is something that is not only true in this movie. The trailers did not promise too much ...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
8,lee_eisenberg,How can we survive in the future?,6,9 June 2015,"Both of the ""Planet of the Apes"" prequels have political themes. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" focuses on the maltreatment of animals in laboratories. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" poses the question of how people will survive if society collapses, and whether we can find common humanity or simply have more wars. The differences in the attitudes of Caesar (a pacifist) and Koba (a warmonger) reflect those among the humans. Caesar has resisted the base impulse towards violence, even though he was the victim of violence perpetrated by humans. He's the Nelson Mandela to Koba's Pol Pot.While it's not a masterpiece, I still think that this movie is a good allegory. It poses the question: if we band together, is it for a noble cause (embodied by Caesar) or is it for evil (embodied by Koba)?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
9,jboothmillard,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,8,2 August 2014,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a fantastic reboot to the franchise which started with five original films, and a one-off from director Tim Burton, and it was a great warm up to the bigger scale from this sequel, from director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In). Basically human civilisation, martial law, economics and generated power have collapsed following the worldwide spread of the ALZ-113 virus, chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis), who was made super intelligent by the viral-based drug, has become leader to the new community of intelligent apes in the Muir Woods. Humans seem to have disappeared, but one is spotted in the forest by Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and Ash (Larramie Doc Shaw), son of Caesar's friend Rocket (Terry Notary), following human Carver (Kirk Acevedo) panicking and shooting Ash, the small group of humans are ordered to leave by Caesar. Remaining humans, genetically immune to the virus, came from the ruined city of San Francisco, living in a guarded tower, scarred bonobo Koba (Toby Kebbell) has a grudge against humans because of his mistreatment, he prompts Caesar to give the humans a message, he speaks that they do not want war, but they will fight and defend their home, he demands the humans stay in their territory and the apes will stay in theirs. With no generated power the humans in the ruined city are running low on supplies, human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) agrees with fellow leader Malcolm (Zero Dark Thirty's Jason Clarke) they should try to reconcile with the apes to activate a hydroelectric dam in their territory, to provide long-term city power, Malcolm is given three days to do so, while Dreyfus remains and arms the survivors with weapons from the armoury. Malcolm is joined by his wife Ellie (Dark Skies' Keri Russell), his son Alexander (Let Me In's Kodi Smit-McPhee) and group members Carver and Foster (Jon Eyez), but he enters the ape community alone, speaking to Caesar he explains about igniting the power of the dam generator, the ape leader allows this, as long as the humans surrender their weapons. The humans slowly bond with Caesar and other apes, mutual distrust starts to subside, there is a moment when Carver is caught with a concealed shotgun, but Caesar's wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) is gravely ill, reconciliation restores as Ellie is permitted to treat her with antibiotics. Meanwhile Koba investigates the human city, he finds the armoury and confronts Caesar, the leader does not want to take any action, the scarred bonobo taunts that he has ""love"" for humans, they get into an aggressive fight, but sticking to the law, ""Ape Not Kill Ape"", he stops himself and forgives Koba, in anger Koba returns to the city, steals an assault rifle and kills two human guards, and he kills Carver and steals his lighter. The dam is repaired and power is restored to the human city, during a celebration for this Koba starts a fire in the ape settlement, and unseen by others Koba shoots Caesar in the chest, he falls from the settlement tree, Koba claims that humans have killed Caesar and orders that the apes wage war against the humans, Malcolm's group hide as the vengeful apes head for San Francisco. The apes steal various weapons from the human city armoury and charge towards the tower, breaching its gates they overrun the building, cause heavy casualties and imprison captured humans, Dreyfuss flees underground, Koba orders to kill all unarmed humans, but apes including Ash refuse, citing Caesar's teachings, Koba therefore kills Ash and imprisons all apes staying loyal to Caesar and his laws. Malcolm and his group find Caesar barely alive on the ground, they take him to his former home in San Francisco, where Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco) raised him, Caesar tells that Koba shot him, knows his notion that apes are better than humans was naive, and he grows nostalgic watching a home video from his childhood, Ellie finds Blue Eyes and brings him to the house to find his father alive. While Blue Eyes returns to the city and frees the caged apes, Malcolm goes to through the city's underground and finds Dreyfuss, him and some men have made radio contact with other survivors in a military base who will send an army to fight the apes, but also Dreyfuss wants to detonate the C-4 underneath the tower. Caesar and the freed apes confront Koba at the summit of the tower, while the leader and the scarred ape fight the C-4 is detonated by Dreyfuss, he dies and the explosion causes part of the tower to collapse, but the fight concludes with Caesar overpowering his enemy, Koba begs for mercy, reminding the leader that apes don't kill apes, Caesar says he is not an ape and lets Koba fall to his death. In the end Malcolm informs Caesar that human military reinforcements were called, both sides realise that the opportunity for peace has diminished, Caesar explains that humans will never forgive apes for starting a war and tells Malcolm to leave safely with his family, Malcolm disappears into the shadows and Caesar gathers with the apes awaiting for battle to come. Also starring Karin Konoval as Maurice, Enrique Murciano as Kemp and Lee Ross as Grey. Oldman is good but perhaps underdeveloped, Clarke and Russell are good at being nice, Kebbell is great as the vicious chimpanzee with a grudge, and of course Serkis propels as the leading ape who despite bad feelings cannot help but empathise with humans. It does indeed feel like a Shakespearean tale, with betrayal, deception and brutality in the mix, it is fantastically scripted, combined with explosive scenes and amazing CGI special effects, it is a most satisfying blockbuster experience that that pulls at both the strings of the heart and mind, a brilliant science-fiction action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
10,ma-cortes,Nice and passable sequel with great visual effects by means of Motion Capture,6,5 August 2014,"Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . Based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by ¨Planet of Apes¨ that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years . 8th movie in the series , it deals with Caesar (Andy Serkis) a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (the fate of Will -James Franco- after the events ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is unknown, but there is a clue , when Caesar returns to his house you can see a sign with an X on the stoop by the door , usually this means someone living there is infected) and a Primatologist Caroline Aranha . The chimpanzee gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that gives rise to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape uprising . Later on , Caesar seeking justice for his fellow primates , as he carries out a riot in which simians turn the tables . Meantime , lots of simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas murder violently every human in sight . Then , a growing nation of genetically evolved apes led by Caesar is threatened by a band of human survivors of the devastating virus unleashed a decade earlier . They reach a fragile peace helped by a group of good humans (Jason Clarke and Keri Russell ; Matt Reeves cast her as the female lead, fifteen years after giving her her most famous role when he cast her as the lead of his TV show Felicity) , but it proves short-lived , as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species . At the ending happens a spectacular , fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Koba (Tony Kebbell) . Then Caesar leads an animal revolt against his enemy in which humans battle the apes led by an intelligent ape .This is an entertaining , big budget sci-fi flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about origin of human being , racism , apartheid , though also packs action, intrigue and amusement . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the second live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling, self aware animal . Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Unlike the previous films, this is the second Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . The performers are very fine , particularly Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs , Jason Clarke , Keri Russell , Gary Oldman are pretty good , the characters are well drawn . Andy Serkis, Terry Notary, and Karin Konoval are the only actors that returned from ""Rise"" to play the characters Caesar, Rocket, and Maurice . Judy Greer replaced stunt-woman/dancer Devyn Dalton as Caesar's mate, Cornelia, and Toby Kebbell replaced stuntman/motion capture performer Christopher Gordon as the scarred lab chimp Koba . Remaining cast formed by Gorillas , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of Motion Capture they are still oddly convincing . In addition to the apes, visual effects company Weta Digital created other digital animals, such as a herd of deer, a grizzly bear, and CG doubles of the live horses . The deer were created using key-frame animation and the digital crowd enhancement software Massive , the bear through key-frame animation, and the horses with a mixture of key-frame animation and motion capture . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be an impressive flick full of action , battles and suspense . In contrast to former movies , this film shot motion capture mostly in exterior sets. Andy Serkis remarked that shooting outside in motion capture suits made all the actors playing apes so sweaty and smelly that they hardly dared to come close to other people after a few days . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver and Bomback , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human beings and animals . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Michael Seresin . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , it's full of fury and sound . This motion picture was well directed by Matt Reeves , being the first ""Planet of the Apes"" to filmed and released in 3D and first Planet of the Apes film to be shot in the 1.85:1 ratio.Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The previous ¨Rise of the Planet of the Apes¨ by Rupert Wyatt with James Franco , Freida Pinto , John Lihtgow , Brian Cox , Tom Felton and Andy Serkis ; the original and the best turns out to be ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , followed by ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) and finally Tim Burton version (2000) with Mark Whalberg , Tim Roth , Helena Bonham Carter and special appearance by Charlton Heston .",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
11,BA_Harrison,Better than Rise.,7,23 February 2020,"I struggled with Planet of the Apes reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, finding the plot dreary, human lead James Franco rather bland, and the CGI ape effects less than convincing. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is far better in terms of storyline, progressing the narrative nicely into post-apocalyptic territory, and the digital trickery to bring the apes to life has improved. That said, I'm still not 100% sold on computer generated animals: it's clever stuff, to be sure, but even the best CGI isn't good enough to convince me that they're anything but pixels.Take the opening scene, for example: an army of apes hunts a herd of stags through the woods, only to be confronted by a bear. All of the animals are CGI, with the fancy camerawork swooping in and out of what is a presumably CGI enhanced environment. It's an overload of not quite completely credible visual wizardry that immediately reinforces the fact that most of what we are seeing has been realised with a fancy 3D software package. Since so much of the rest of the film relies on this technology, the whole experience, no matter how skilfully told, doesn't quite sit right. It's a shame because the acting and direction are very good, and the writing enjoyable (not always plausible, but still fun) with plenty of pathos and loads of action, as the human survivors of a 'simian flu' epidemic come to blows with a civilisation of intelligent apes lead by chimpanzee Caesar (performed via motion capture technology by Andy Serkis).If you're a fan of all things ape, then the positives outweigh the negatives, ensuring that the film is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. If anything, it does provide the awesome sight of a snarling chimpanzee riding a horse while firing two machine guns.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
12,paul_haakonsen,War has already begun...,7,15 May 2017,"The 2014 ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" was actually a rather impressive addition to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, and it was a very entertaining movie.Writers Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Rick Jaffa and Pierre Boulle did a good job in constructing a well-rounded storyline with interesting characters and lots of action.There is a nice continuation to the story, picking up from the 2011 ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". Which puts the two movies together quite nicely, especially if you watch these back to back.The storyline in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is good, and it picks up a good pace right from the very beginning, and it continues on in this pace all throughout the entire movie, which leaves for a very entertaining movie experience.Furthermore, the characters in the movie, both man and ape, were well-rounded and detailed, having distinctive personalities, traits and characteristics.And they had a great ensemble of acting performers on the cast list. I did really enjoy Gary Oldman in his role in this movie, as it felt like the role was custom-written specifically for him. Andy Serkis did a great job with his performance as Caesar. But it was generally a nice thing to see a relatively unfamiliar ensemble of cast for a movie such as this.The special and practical effects in the movie was quite good, and it really worked out quite well because it was so realistic to look at. And having good special effects is a definite must for a movie of this kind.There is a good amount of action in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" as well, combined with an interesting story.My rating of this movie is a very solid 7 out of 10 stars.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
13,Quinoa1984,"Apes, humans, politics and war",9,1 August 2014,"If the first movie (Rise) was really much more about and the characters (that is slightly stronger emotion in establishing Caesar and the humans, all of whom are gone now), this is about ideas, and looking at what happens when war is, as is so often in the world of the past and today, an inevitability.What happens when the Apes have to contend with the straggling humans that are left? What happens when a ruler has to contend just as fiercely with dissent in his own government so to speak while also having to find a balance with the 'others' that both post a threat AND want to find a path to peace? like the 1968 Apes movie, more so really, this looks at the world we live in and transmogrifies it into the popcorn world. Captain America did that earlier this year, and so did X Men to an extent. This has so much to chew on in terms of politics (America, dems vs republicans; Israel vs Palestine; ""you're with us or you're with the terrorists"" jingoism) and yet it's a fun movie to watch amid the high drama. maybe the humans are just slightly more developed in the first movie than here (but they are just fine and Clarke and Russel and Oldman do well). Maybe the final battle between Caesar and the rival Magneto/Khan Ape, Koba, becomes too much like any given fight between two rivals in an action movie, and some of the circumstances leading up to it take some suspension of disbelief. But the movie is filled with so much gray areas, so much about how both sides, at least in several circles, want peace or at least stability along with such a towering presence in Caesar (Andy Serkis does his best ape since... King Kong) that it flies in the face of a lot of dumb blockbusters that don't have any thought behind it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
14,BandSAboutMovies,More apes,5,3 January 2020,"Matt Reeves is known for the American remake of Let Me In as well as Cloverfield. He's had pretty great success at making Apes films, as he was behind both this film and 2017's War for the Planet of the Apes. He also wrote the fun popcorn flick Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. Oh yeah - and he also created the TV show Felicity.Ten years later, a group of people in San Francisco struggle to stay alive in the aftermath of the Simian Flu epidemic that's wiping out humanity, all while Caesar tries to maintain dominance over his tribe of apes located in the Muir Woods.The humans are led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke, the remake of Pet Sematary) and they accidentally encroach into ape territory in search of a hydroelectric dam. Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his friend Ash encounter the humans and Carver injures the latter. Koba, a bonobo scarred by human tests, urges Caesar (again, Andy Serkis) to go to war with the humans. However, Malcolm, his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee, who was in The Road and played Nightcrawler in the later X-Men movies) become friends with the apes, even treating Caesar's wife Cornelia's illness.Judy Greer, who played that role, has a husband who is a huge Planet of the Apes fan. They had a chimp husband-and-wife cake topper at their wedding, while Planet of the Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes played at the bar.Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), another human leader, takes up arms, Koba goes into action. He sets the ape settlement on fire, nearly kills Caesar and blames the humans. When Ash refuses to betray Caesar's teachings, Koba throws him to his death and locks up anyone loyal to their fallen leader.War between ape and human is inevitable, even if Malcolm and his family save Caesar and nurse him back to health. Koba must fall, the first human army must be defeated and then the tribes of apes will be ready for the War for the Planet of the Apes.Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver returned to write this film, joined by Marc Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard, Insurgent, The Wolverine).I dig that the orangutan is named Maurice, which is a reference to Maurice Evans, who portrayed Dr. Zaius in the original films.The ending is pretty great, too. Koba is left hanging from a ledge after being knocked down by Caesar. He tries to say that ""Ape shall not kill ape,"" but Koba has already broken that rule many, many times by killing Ash and other apes. Caesar declares that Koba is not an ape and kills him.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
15,michaelRokeefe,"""Apes...do not want war!""",8,21 January 2015,"It has been ten years since their escape; a massive group of super-intelligent apes, led by Caesar(Andy Serkis), live deep in the woods and thrive in a hunting/gathering culture. A group of civilians not killed by the Simian Flu pandemic are gathered in San Francisco and have been degraded by civil unrest, economic collapse and a shortage of power. A small group of humans led by Malcolm(Jason Clarke)have found an abandon hydroelectric dam in the woods and being able to repair it and get it running again could provide much needed power to summon other survivors for help. But something has gone very wrong; an ape has discovered the group. An iffy peace agreement is reached between the humans and apes, but goes awry when a human gun is found that breaks the treaty. An all-out war is unable to avoid, with the conflict determining which species will dominate the planet.This installment of the franchise seems to be written better and there is noticeable character development with the humans as well as the apes.

16,Theo Robertson,Much Better Than The First Film Which Isn't A Massive Endorsement,7,20 July 2014,"After seeing RISE on Channel 4 last night I promised myself I wasn't going to waste two hours of my life and money on a bus and cinema ticket to watch a Hollywood blockbuster sequel . Maybe the Summer heat has been frying my brain because I found myself taking a long walk to Edinburgh city centre and spending £8.20 on a ticket to watch DAWN . Perhaps I was trying to teach myself a lesson in that I should always stick to gut instinct ? When someone makes a decision they should stick to it otherwise bad things might happen DAWN starts in exactly the same manner as RISE finished . Simian flu sweeps across the world killing billions of humans and this economy of storytelling is very effective indeed . Unfortunately when we're introduced to the surviving humans there's been a massive spanner thrown in to the works because they're all living in a small district of San Francisco . What's wrong with that you ask ? Common sense should tell you that's the worst place you can stay in after a catastrophe . As John Wyndham and John Christopher point out in their novels a city is nothing more than a concrete desert . Surely they'd be hundreds of thousands of dead bodies in the city ? Won't this lead to all types of secondary diseases ? How you going to farm crops in a city ? I suppose there might be some supplies left but after ten years of industrial collapse people still have access to cigars and cigarettes . I'm guessing simian flu only affects non smokers ? I'm also guessing you're not supposed to think too deeply about this scenario because it doesn't really hold up to much examination . Characters are shown to having access to military hardware but the military are conspicuous by their absence . This is probably down to plot function . The human survivors need access to a hydro dam just outside the city in order to gain electricity and kick off the plot . The human enclave need electricity in order to power communications to contact other human communities but it's impossible to believe that in ten years after the flu outbreak not one single warship has berthed in the docks , or a military plane has landed at the airport or a self sufficient military unit has entered the cityAnother slight problem is that the characters are like in the previous film rather one dimensional and underwritten . We've got the nice male human character , the nice female human character , the bad ethnic minority human , the good ethnic minority human etc and this is mirrored by the ape community . If you've any knowledge of Soviet history you might just second guess how things pan out in the ape community and it's the actors playing the apes in a motion capture suits who make the biggest impression . If you're going to cast Gary Oldman at least give him a part deserving of his talents and have him do something interesting with his character It's a pity the film is let down by a succession of small flaws because I did like it but wanted to love it and the movie doesn't quite pull it off . It is a solid relatively dark blockbuster better than the film that preceded it and better than most Summer fare that's been released over the last few years but don't think it's anywhere near deserving of its position of 150 on the IMDb top movies list and feel like the HOBBIT movies will quickly drop out of the list . As it stands the original franchise was probably more enjoyable as a whole due to its imagination",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
17,utgard14,"""Ape not kill ape.""",7,1 December 2014,"Spectacular sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes continues this wonderful reboot of the '70s movies. This one is a reworking of the story from Battle of the Planet of the Apes, which was the weakest entry in the original series. 'Dawn' is superior to 'Battle' in every way, although a notch below 'Rise' in my book. The story picks up ten years after the events of 'Rise.' Caesar is now the leader of the apes living in the woods north of San Francisco. The only humans remaining are the ones immune to the virus introduced in the prior film. The humans and apes have a tenuous relationship that is further strained by humans attempting to enter the ape habitat to reactivate a hydroelectric dam. Caesar wants peace between the humans and the apes, so he allows them in to fix the dam. This doesn't sit well with some of the apes, particularly one named Koba, who wants to wipe out the remaining humans. Extraordinary action scenes and CGI highlight the second half. I actually wasn't very impressed with the CGI in the first few scenes. I felt the faces on some of the apes looked kind of cartoonish. But it seemed to improve after that and I had no further complaints. The first half is full of incredible character moments (not that those are missing from the second half entirely). It's a really well-written movie. One of the best things about this series (and the original) is the great writing and characterizations. They could easily appeal to the lowest common denominator market and just have mindless violence and apes ninja turtling it up but they don't. They don't sacrifice story for spectacle and yet they still put out an exceptional blockbuster-style movie. Michael Bay could learn a thing or a million.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
18,zardoz-13,Ape-solutely Fabulous!!!,9,20 July 2014,"Watching ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" reminded me of Hollywood cavalry westerns from the 1950s, like ""Broken Arrow,"" where noble Native Americans confronted white settlers over land rights with a cavalry scout serving as a go-between to negotiate the issue. Invariably, no matter how amicable relations between the two factions got, war erupted with deplorable results. Fanning the flames of dissent, unscrupulous whites often took advantage of defiant Indians with contraband liquor and firearms. The Native Americans chieftains as well as their white counterparts respectively contended not only with treachery within their own ranks, but also the collateral damage such senseless violence yielded. Mind you, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is not a western. Occasionally, this futuristic, Twentieth Century Fox release resembles one. When they scrimmage for war against mankind, the marauding apes arm themselves with fully automatic weapons, saddle their horses, and stampede through the remnants of the human race like pugnacious Apaches. This imaginative, visually resplendent, PG-13 rated, sci-fi saga depicts no-holds-barred warfare. You won't see anything that might sicken you. Casualties by gunfire occur on both sides, but ""Cloverfield"" director Matt Reeves keeps the violence comparatively immaculate. You won't witness anything as savage as the beach-front ""Saving Private Ryan"" battle scenes. Meanwhile, unlike its provocative predecessor ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""Dawn"" dwells more on the dynamics between the apes rather than the humans. Incidentally, all the primate characters alive at fade-out in the original make encore appearances. Caesar (Andy Serkis of ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) dominates his horde as the alpha ape, while his creepy lieutenant, Koba (Toby Kebbell of ""RocknRolla""), abuses his trust. Naturally, villains are always more gaudy than heroes, and Koba makes an incomparable adversary not only for Caesar but also the human leader, Malcolm (Jason Clarke of ""Lawless""), who wants to live in peace with the primates. Koba emerges as one wicked ape. He does everything but twirl a mustache like a vaudeville fiend. ""Total Recall"" scenarist Mark Bomback along with original ""Rise"" scribes Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver give Koba two memorable moments. Koba is the kind of villain who displays no qualms about killing and requires little provocation to resort to violence. Koba's disarming antics that lull two clueless, heavily-armed humans into a false sense of security are impressive.""Dawn"" resumes the narrative thread about a decade after the events in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" If you missed ""Rise,"" you may find yourself at a disadvantage with ""Dawn."" Although we never saw him die in ""Rise,"" the human protagonist, Gen-Sys geneticist Will Rodman (James Franco), who emerged as Caesar's surrogate father, has not been accounted for, so he could still be alive. However, he never shows up in ""Dawn."" Meantime, the ALZ-113 aerosol that Rodman developed after the failure of ALZ 112 has wiped out most of mankind. Designated as the Simian Flu, only the strongest humans survive, while the apes thrive. You may remember Rodman's lab assistant, Franklin (Tyler Labine), died from exposure to ALZ-113 during an experiment on Koba in the first film. Before he died, Franklin infected Rodman's next door neighbor, international airline pilot Husiker (David Hewlett), who is ultimately responsible for spreading the virus. As far as we're informed, a small community of humans residing in the ruins of San Francisco have been struggling tenaciously for ten years after the events of the first movie to survive. Nominally, this lone group of humans are led by a former soldier, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman of ""Lawless""), who is preparing to arm his people. They have exhausted their make-shift power supply and are about to be plunged into darkness. An engineer named Malcolm has convinced Dreyfus that if they can reactivate a nearby a hydroelectric plant then they will be in good shape. The obstacle to bringing the plant back on line is that it lies up in the forest where Caesar and his apes have settled and lived in peace for ten winters. Malcolm takes his wife and son along with a hydroelectric employee, Carver (Kirk Acevedo of ""The Thin Red Line""), who knows how to start it up. Unfortunately, for everybody involved, Carver has struck out ahead of Malcolm and company and he stumbles onto two young chimps. Terrified by their presence, Carver whips out a revolver and wounds one. No sooner has he shot the poor chimp than Caesar and an army of apes, gorillas, and orangutans have surrounded the humans. This sounds like the Apaches surrounding Randolph Scott in the desert after he has encroached on their land. Predictably, Caesar is not happy with this turn of events. Similarly, no sooner has Caesar agreed to a truce to allow Malcolm and his people crank up the hydroelectric plant that Koba undermines Caesar's authority.The CGI in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is twice as impressive as its predecessor. The entire ape cast wore motion-capture suits. Meaning, they didn't have to undergo elaborate make-up and costuming like their forerunners in the first franchise. Back in those days, the actors who played the apes wore simian gloves, simian feet, and a simian's head, while the rest of their bodies were concealed in outfits that dictated their job. Andy Serkis is amazing as Caesar, and his performance as a simian is about as close as anyone will come to impersonating a primate. Toby Kebbell is likewise awesome as the villainous Koba. The apes are as convincing as they can possibly be, and you will be astonished at how life-like the actors and actresses are, particularly when they move. Lack of depth undermines the human characters, principally Gary Oldman's Dreyfus, while Carver is not only hopelessly paranoid but also hopelessly impetuous. At two hours and ten minutes in length, ""Dawn"" advances the storyline beyond the original, and Reeves stages several spectacular set-pieces. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" amounts to far more than just monkey business as usual.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

20,view_and_review,This Movie has Serious Wow,8,11 August 2014,"It's amazing how my brother and I walked out of this movie having two divergent opinions about the most crucial part of the plot. The Simean Flu has spread and wiped out the majority of mankind while a small but formidable band of apes has benefited from the genesis of this virus. A group of people are trying their best to hold on to what little bit of civilization they have left and doing that requires electricity. Accessing that electricity is the tricky part because it is in the heart of ape controlled territory. This is where my brother and I part ways.He identifies with the apes whereas I identify with the people. He sees the apes in a more human sense having a sovereign right to the land they occupy. He uses for his argument people of the past that have been intruded upon and had their land and rights taken because they didn't have the weapons, tech, or manpower to protect themselves.I, on the other hand, identify with the humans and see the apes as apes that happen to be more intelligent than normal. My argument: those apes can step aside so that humanity can survive. No, I'm not saying eradicate them, but I'm saying that if it comes down to human survival and ape survival I'm not having a second thought about the matter. Just because they can grunt out a few words doesn't mean that we sit down and negotiate. We need access to that area and you're in the way.I know I'm phrasing it in a very crude and blunt manner but essentially my point is that survival is paramount. People and animals alike will do some very extreme and not-so-civil things to survive; especially if they're on the brink of extinction. The very fact we were debating this issue so vehemently makes this a good movie. The 1968 Planet of the Apes was also rich with symbolism and a socially relevant message. Was it symbolism in this movie? Was it awaking a social awareness? I can't say. Perhaps it was for some and perhaps it was mere entertainment for others. Whatever view you have I still think the movie was done well and was a good prequel to the original.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The dodgy screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback has clunky exposition and some eye- rolling sequences (to wit: a teen explaining a 'kegger' to an orangutan in a bonding attempt!) and listless direction by Matt Reeves, the wooden acting of Russell and waste of Oldman (clearly cashing a paycheck in a retread of 'villain' for 'villain''s sake) and lackluster lead human Clarke barely registers any hope for humanity.

22,neil-476,Very good part 2 - roll on part 3!,9,18 July 2014,"It is 10 years since Caesar liberated the San Francisco apes and, since then, the simian flu bug which escaped at the same time has decimated the human population. The group of humans surviving in San Francisco have nearly consumed the remaining resources and, on mounting an expedition to try to reactivate the electricity generated from a dam, they encounter Caesar's now well-established ape colony in the forest. Malcolm (representing the humans) and Caesar are able to reach a co-operative understanding, but the human group is prepared to get what it wants by force if necessary, and Koba (the scarred human-hating chimp from the first film) wants the remaining humans destroyed. The power games which result could end in tragedy.The story here is fairly familiar (albeit not necessarily having been done with apes before!), but it is unwrapped well - I never felt that it was overly predictable. It is always moving onwards, always engaging, often exciting, sometimes moving, and the marriage of CGI trickery and real world images is so good that you never know what is real and what isn't. You very quickly stop wondering at the trickery, and simply accept the reality of these intelligent apes.The ape performances are probably, on balance, better than their human counterparts - you care about Caesar in a way in which you never really care about any of the people.This was a very enjoyable sequel.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
23,ferguson-6,"Monkey Me, Monkey You",8,13 July 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Admitting a weakness is the first step. Yes, I am a proud, long-time fan of this series. My soft spot for these films began when I was a kid - mesmerized by the 1968 original, while watching from the back seat of the car, as the clunky metal speaker hung on the window and my parents sat in the front. Oh, and yes, I was wearing my pajamas! It's pretty much impossible to describe the technological advances in movies since Charleston Heston stumbled into one of the biggest shocker endings the movies have ever provided (and that was 46 years ago!). Heck, the advances since the 2011 movie with James Franco is staggering to see. The combination of real actors, CGI and fantastic motion capture technology make for a realistic look that is unsettling at times.Many know the work of Andy Serkis (Gollam, King Kong) who is considered the master of motion capture acting, and here he returns as Caeser, the leader of the apes. Only this time, he has real competition, especially from Toby Kebbell as Koba, his friend who was previously mistreated in the lab by humans ... thereby explaining their opposite view of the few remaining humans.This entry from director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) picks up 10 years after the 2011 movie. The apes have established a very cool community in the forest, while only a few immune humans survived the lab-born simian virus that was leaked. The apes have continued to get smarter and even have their own culture and code (apes don't kill apes). The surviving humans have fought amongst themselves and only recently organized a faction with Gary Oldman's Dreyfus as their leader. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) takes a small group over the Golden Gate to see if they can reignite a dam which could produce the energy so desperately needed in human town.Almost immediately, humans and apes meet. The big philosophical chess match begins with Malcolm and Caeser negotiating for cooperation and peace, while Koda and Drefus see war as the only solution. Alliances are drawn, fragile accords made, loyalties are questioned, and hierarchies crumble. See, it turns out the apes are like us, and we are like the apes.There is a terrific battle scene, but the real joy here is the personalities and look of the apes. It is fascinating to watch the interactions ... and that final shot is startling! The only downside is the caricature of Carver played by Avecedo. He is the token human d-bag but his character is so over the top it ruins most of his scenes. Luckily, there are very few ... and they are offset by the really cool horse dismount displayed by Caesar. If you buy into this, it's a tension-filled jolly good time.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
24,anaconda-40658,Dawn of a Franchise Born Again.,9,13 July 2015,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014): Dir: Matt Reeves / Cast: Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell: One of the very best editions of this franchise. It regards the emerging sense of hostility with the reality of a virus that has wiped out most of mankind while apes seem to be progressing. Andy Serkis is brilliant as the ape leader Caesar whose army of apes desire to live peacefully until humans trespass. Apparently these humans need to get through to the dam in hopes that they can spark electricity through to a ruin San Francisco and hopefully find other survivors. Tobey Kebbell plays another ape named Koba whose memories of abuse from humans have caused him to separate from Caesar's second in command to rage war against humans. Director Matt Reeves previously made Cloverfield and Let Me In. Here he creates an entertaining epic with convincing special effects. The apes are a fantastic creation with Serkis, Kebbell among others acting under makeup and CGI visual imagery. The one big flaw is that the human characters are total cardboard. Jason Clarke and Keri Russell provide little if any personality to the limited material they are given, and Gary Oldman is the human version of Koba with the exception that the role is bland. The apes ride in on horse back striking back at the humans while Caesar realizes some flaws in his thinking and reclaims his position from those corrupting peace into war. Great theme regarding co-existing and the reality of mankind drawing wildlife into a smaller living space as we constantly overtake and bring about the dawn of greed.

After the outbreak of simian flu, the majority of the human race has been wiped out, and only a handful of immune humans are left to fend for themselves.After an encounter with a group of humans looking for ways to generate power, and after an incident which involved human shooting an ape, Caesar eventually allows the humans to get access in order to help them.But Koba, an ape who is bitter about being tested on so severely, thinks Caesar has a weakness for humans, and stabs Caesar in the back, trying to take back the titular planet.A sequel was inevitable, ROTPOTA was a phenomenal achievement, both story wise and technically.The sequel carries on the narrative from the very last shot of ROTPOTA, and this is a very clever turn from the writers, as it gives the apes the upper hand from the beginning.One cannot deny the monumental effort WETA has done on the ape effects, they are brilliant and as groundbreaking as Bullet Time.Serkis is once again king of the Mo Cap, and breathes life into Caesar, making him sympathetic and full of empathy, but at the same time very volatile and unpredictable.Kebbel though, almost steals the film as Koba, this is the fear factor of the film, and there is one scene, where he is toying with two humans, that is almost unbearable, because you just know something bad is going to happen.And this is the weak part of the film, the human element. Apart from Malcom, the humans are your stereotypical characters, and Russell is wasted as Ellie, just when you thought her character was going to be fleshed out a little more, she literally disappears.And then there is Oldman. And while the guy is a fine actor,there was no real need for his character to be in the film. I know it's supposed to balance with Koba, but his character is literally in it for no more than fifteen minutes, and doesn't really do much.Other than that, its a solid, intelligent movie, that proves that big summer movies can be entertaining, as well as a solid script, and clever narrative.Transformers: Age Of Exhaustion, take note......",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Gary Oldman looks bedraggled enough.Liked the San Francisco setting and City Hall scene though the Golden Gate was under utilized. More familiar landmarks and scenes of SF could have been used.

The virus unleashed at the end of that film has wiped out most of the human race, but a large group of survivors live in a walled section of San Francisco while the chimp Caesar and his band of apes live in the forests north of the city. The humans need to take control of the dam near the ape's village to secure power for their city, which leads to both friendly and hostile relations. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell lead the human cast.This film's on par with the previous one, so if you liked that one you'll like this one too. The CGI is both good and yet cartoony. Strangely, the CGI in ""Jurassic Park"" was better, and that was 21 years ago! But, hey, they're better that the FX on Syfy and you get used to 'em after the first act.The forest cinematography is awesome, but the story is only mildly compelling. The characters are okay, but bland and the plot fairly predictable. For instance, when Keri' Russell's character goes to the ape village you know exactly what she's going to do; and when Caesar spares a fellow ape you know exactly what that ape's going to do. Overall, I was expecting better, but it's a decent addition to the apes saga and ranks about the 4th or 5th best in the entire series.The film runs 130 minutes and was shot at Golden Ears Provincial Park, Campbell River & Vancouver, British Columbia with beauty shots of San Francisco.GRADE: B-",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The evolution theme is not very evident at all.This does continue the thin thread of the drug causing the apes evolving. There is drama and action though no fitting conclusion. There is another human force coming but not arriving before the end of the movie. That appears to be the set up. The Ceasar character from Escape From The Planet of the Apes is still going at the end of this one. The special effects here and Ape CGI costumes are amazing.The battle sequence at the end is a reminder of a milder form of District 9.The human costumes are quite realistic though the humans do not get much to do in this one other than killed or be killed. There is a c-4 bomb sequence that is like the bomb sequence at the end of Beneath The Planet of The Apes. That one destroyed the whole planet but now that the film has moved to the Pacific Coast, the destruction at the end is more laid back, but these apes mean business. With the openings here I could see several directions this could go.In the documentary about the original series, FOX being broke, had to make the apes in the first movies into a primitive society. Rod Serling's original script treatment would have those Apes with a more Scientifically advanced society. With today's CGI, I think someone should go back and dig out Serling's original Idea and make it into the next film. Where to go with the next one depends.

31,lasttimeisaw,Intense sequel with great promise for next step,7,4 August 2014,"As a compulsive purist, it is aching to write this review since I missed the opening scenes for 10 minutes at least, watched it in a shoddy 3D screen and the surging audience after Ramadan blindsided both me and (obviously) the cinema, thanks to a long queue and the lack of countermeasure from the tickets office, what a mood-killing damper!So the first scene I saw is the confrontation between the human squad led by Malcolm (Clarke) and the apes, with Caesar (Serkis) now crowning as their leader. As most of the mankind has been obliterated by deadly virus from the preceding RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2011, 7/10), a desolate dystopia scenario cannot be more familiar to present audience, which effectively tips the scale to the uprising of apes versus man's dominant lethality and sets up as a logical prequel to PLANET OF THE APES (1968, 8/10). The animation capture technology of personifying thinking-talking apes has again proved to be a chief accomplishment in this franchise reboot, Serkis, Kebbell (plays Koba, the ape presents strong animosity toward human race due to the suffering of inhuman treatment in the human lab) and Thurston (plays Blue Eyes, Caesar's eldest son) impressively morph into their primate personages by aping human movements, body gestures and facial expressions with minute verisimilitude. The plot draws lessons from Shakespearean complex, conspires to a ferocious ape usurper and bluntly puts him in the villain default (unlike its prequel, where rapacious human beings are the arch enemy). When the internecine friction takes the stage, mankind is subjugated to sideline, Malcolm and his family are amicable friends, but Dreyfus (Oldman), the leader of the remaining humans and his gangs are frivolous saboteurs doomed in their narrow-mindedness. Jason Clarke believably justifies that he can lead a blockbuster too given a proper chance, him, Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee form a close knit, as the last hope for men; Gary Oldman, bears the ambiguity in his actions, is a pitiful sacrifice for the wrong cause. Apes are the stars, maybe in the next installment, no men is required, the film will still be overwhelmingly compelling, suffice to say, the CGI effect and action set pieces are among the best of the year, particularly the ones involve the mobilities of great mass, gun-wielding apes' charging on the horses, one scene when Koba attack a tank with a 360 degree shot of its surroundings, superbly orchestrated! The final showdown is also fluidly white-knuckle with vivid tumbling down veracity, although the casualty is conspicuously underestimated to create a spectacle that the number of apes is not drastically declined after the monolith wreckage. The director chair is handed from Rupert Wyatt (for RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) to Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD 2008, 7/10 and LET ME IN 2010, 7/10), a wise decision since the scale and gravitas clearly go up a notch, but the 3D surplus does hurt the viewing, too dim and overstretched in this case, otherwise I might rate it higher, perhaps I should give it another try and catch up with the missing parts.

With the environment and graphics and all. The story on the other hand is passable but just didn't really grabbed my attention and emotion as the first one. With the development of the story being all super slow-paced and all. The beginning started off strong, than the story started to go in a pretty cliché direction. However seeing how the first one ended, this is probably the only way the story could have gone. It has the right elements to make it a good movie, but I personally didn't find it all that great with the praise it's been getting. As the movie progressed it just started to get duller and duller. I was tired while watching this film, but I rarely fall asleep during a fresh movie. I however fell asleep during this one. It's a alright watch, but far from being standout movie compared to the first one.6.8/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
33,sddavis63,A War Movie More Than Anything,4,20 August 2017,"This is the first (of probably several) sequels to the 2011 ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" that rebooted the series. At first it seems to work pretty well, taking up basically at exactly the point the previous movie left off (albeit ten years later) with the apes living in the forest outside San Francisco. They've progressed nicely, have built a nice home for themselves, and have learned sign language (which does seem more realistic than having them speaking fluent English would have been - although Caesar and his rival Koba do have some linguistic abilities.) Caesar is in charge of the ape society and everything seems more or less good with them. Not going so well, though, is human life. The simian virus has killed millions and there are a few stragglers left in the city, who are running short of power after all this time, and decide that they could make use of a dam to power their homes. Unfortunately, the dam in right in the middle of ape territory - and the apes are none too happy about having humans around.This is a movie about confrontations. Most obvious is the confrontation between the apes and the humans. Neither like or trust the other. Humans still see the intelligent apes as just plain animals, while many apes remember and resent their treatment at the hands of humans. Obviously, the human move into ape territory is going to lead to conflict, and that conflict takes up a good part of the movie. But there's also the confrontation between Caesar and Koba - another ape who thinks that Caesar is far too kind and sympathetic to humans - and a battle emerges between the two of them for the leadership of the ape community. As it turns out, intelligent apes are pretty much like humans. They want their own way, and eventually power and brute force determines which one gets their way. Those things make this a pretty dark movie when compared to the original.Somehow, this movie didn't really grab me. I have to admit that I even fell asleep for about 10 or 15 minutes and wasn't interested enough to go back to see what I missed, although after I woke up I did manage to stick it out to the end. I liked the original reboot. I found it very thoughtful and thought-provoking. But aside from the Caesar-Koba battle and the reflection on power and corruption, this movie lacked some of that thoughtfulness. In many ways, this became a war movie more than anything, with apes attacking the human city. The human characters are all completely new. There are no holdovers from the original movie. I did miss James Franco from that first installment. In this, Jason Clarke plays the main human character, but Malcolm didn't connect with me the way Franco's Will did. In fact, none of the human characters really seemed well enough developed to mean anything to a viewer. And - as I said about the first movie - somehow the CGI apes don't really connect with me either.I didn't expect this to be as good as ""Rise"" - and it wasn't. It was too much of a war movie filled with battles. (4/10)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
34,Hellmant,Yet another masterpiece form Matt Reeves!,9,13 July 2014,"'DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This sequel to 2011's 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' is the eighth installment in the 'PLANET OF THE APES' film franchise and the second chapter in the recent reboot series. It was directed by Matt Reeves, who also directed the 2010 teen vampire romance remake 'LET ME IN' and the 2008 found footage monster flick 'CLOVERFIELD'. It was written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (the last two also wrote 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES'). It stars Andy Serkis once again (as Caesar) and costars Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell and Codi Smit-McPhee (who also appeared in 'LET ME IN'). I found it to be a really entertaining and well made science fiction flick; an improvement over the last installment and the best of the series since the 1968 Charlton Heston classic.The story is set in 2028, ten years after the ALZ-113 virus killed off most of the humans on the planet. Caesar (Serkis) leads a growing ape civilization in the Muir Woods. A small group of human survivors, who are immune to the virus, live in San Franciso. They're lead by Dreyfus (Oldman) and are desperately in need of a new source for power. The humans think they can solve their problems by restarting a hydroelectric dam's generator, located in the community of apes. When the two societies discover each other, many (on both sides) want to go to war; out of distrust, bigotry and paranoia. Caesar tells the humans to leave them alone and they won't be harmed but a human named Malcolm (Clarke) begs Caesar to let a small group of human survivors work on the generator. A bond forms between Malcolm, his friends, and the apes but others don't want to give peace a chance; especially an ape named Koba (Kebbell), who wants revenge for past abuse he suffered.I was pleasantly surprised by how much more the movie revolves around the apes, rather than the humans. The story is really a lot more about the inner struggling of the ape civilization and how it falls apart, for a lot of the same reasons humanity has similar problems. The movie also, of course, deals with the bigotry and hatred that forms between two different societies but it focuses a lot more on the increasing flaws of a new civilization (which at first seemed ideal and perfect). We say human nature causes a lot of our biggest problems but this movie argues those same problems arise in any civilization. It's a really well made and thought provoking movie (and the visual effects are spectacular).

35,cherold,Dreary and ponderous,4,17 April 2017,"Based on some reviews, I went into this expecting a big action blockbuster. But based on the first hour, which is all I could take, this is more of a dreary morality play about the white man and the noble savage. In this case, the noble savage is simian and the white man is not entirely white or man, but that's still the feel. The few remaining humans after an apocalypse encounter a tribe of flourishing super-apes. Some believe in co-existence, some not so much. The movie is very much of a mind that noble people who want to work together will be undercut by jerks. In order to make this happen, the movie even creates an unconvincing reason for the head noble human to drag along a virulent anti-aper along with him into the jungle. It's the sort of predictable situation this movie seems inordinately fond of.The CGI is pretty good. The apes aren't quite real, but the scenes where masses of them would coalesce are pretty impressive. But outside of that this is pure tedium.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

37,Robert_duder,"Shaping out to be one of the best ""mainstream"" franchises ever made period.",9,29 July 2014,"The first film ""Rise Of The Planet of The Apes"" literally floored me. It was probably one of the best films of 2011. It wasn't just the story, the performances, the special effects but just how everything worked together and as another IMDb reviewer pointed out it completely transcends what we know as the ""hollywood Blockbuster."" Dawn of The Planet Of The Apes takes everything that was great about ""Rise"" and builds on it exponentially. Where in the first film we literally watched Caesar grow up and fell in love with him. We watched in horror and fascination as he rose to lead the Apes. In Dawn, we see their entire civilization and become immersed in their lives in the most believable way you could possibly imagine for a so-called ""science fiction"" film. I was once again nearly in tears more times than I care to admit because you become beyond attached to this beautiful creatures. Are there good guys? Yes...human and Ape, and bad guys...human and ape. This isn't really about who is right and who is wrong but rather two civilizations trying to find middle ground. The world is wiped out by a virus, not by the Apes. I can only hope and pray that they continue making this film as brilliant as it has been this far.I have to start with Andy Serkis. This guy has literally revolutionized Hollywood and entertainment as we know it. I'm not sure he's getting the credit he deserves for being a pioneer. Starting with Lord of The Rings and then King Kong and now playing Caesar...he is absolutely astonishing considering his entire persona is hidden behind CGI. He is essentially a voice actor but a step beyond thanks to motion-capture and he has this incredible way of making you become completely and utterly attached to his character. Caesar would not be Caesar if Serkis was not playing him. He is brilliant period. Jason Clarke isn't the strongest member of the cast but he does a solid job. Compared to perhaps James Franco's leading role in the first film, he pales in comparison but this instalment is all about the Apes so the human counterparts don't matter as much. Clarke still shows some intensity and some good emotion but I would have liked a little more chemistry between him and Caesar. The amazing Gary Oldman was harshly underused I thought. He had a great character and was excellent but I felt like there was more there and that they could have built on him even more than they did Clarke. Still he was amazing. Keri Russell was also underused as Clarke's love and a main character as well. She is still very good but much like Oldman there could have been more there. Kodi Smit-McPhee rounds out the main human cast and he was very good too and had some really great emotional scenes. Toby Kebbell is absolutely mesmerizing as Koba. Between him and Serkis they should both be award nominated for not only pioneering this technology but giving jaw dropping performances. Nick Thurston also deserves mention as Casesar's son who will bring tears to your eyes with his bravery, courage and moments of leadership. I also have to mention Karin Konoval who has a very small role as she did in the first film as Maurice but he is quickly becoming my favourite character.I honestly thought when director Rupert Wyatt wasn't returning to helm the second film that it would not be nearly as good. I felt like Wyatt's style and talent was one major thing that made Rise so good. Well, I'm proud to say that the film makers kept the ball rolling. Matt Reeves who is actually someone who doesn't have a TON of experience brings this world to life in an incredible way. This may shape up to be easily one of the best films of 2014 and I'm almost certain one of my personal favourites! I hate CGI which sounds ridiculous considering the backbone of this film is CGI. I will say that it shows in many, many scenes. I was almost distracted by the animation and blatantly obvious use of computer graphics BUT they are heads and tails above other so called ""Blockbusters"" because the story, script, characters and actors are SO good that you actually understand the use of CGI and don't mind it one bit. This film is an emotional roller coaster with plenty of action, drama, romance and an underlying message about social behaviour, family, war and history. It actually builds on and pays homage to what I think they tried to do with the original classic Planet of The Apes films. This is outstanding. See it now!! 9/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
38,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"The dawn of a new era in serious, motion-capture-driven story-telling.",9,21 February 2018,"One of the best things about this entertaining and intelligent action-thriller is the way that it doesn't pick sides, doesn't paint the humans as stereotypical villains in the way that something like, say, 'Avatar (2009)' does. Instead, it portrays its delicate situation with nuance in a way which allows everyone's perspective to be both clear and understandable. Even the main ape antagonist, who's militant sensibilities stem from a deep-rooted mistrust in humanity established in the prior title, has reasonable and somewhat supportable motivations. Once the set-up is out of the way and the action - which is bigger in scope, spectacle and success this time - begins, the feature still keeps its focus on character and this is what allows it to remain as emotionally resonant as it really is. 9/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
39,bowmanblue,A solid sequel,8,25 January 2015,"'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is actually a remake of... well, who cares? It was one of the 'lesser' original 'Apes' movies and no one really remembers it. It is however the confirmed sequel to 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' – the movie that officially buried all memories of Tim Burton's misfire remake of the first Planet of the Apes film.The movie kicks off about ten years after 'simian flu' has all but wiped out the human race, leaving the animal population pretty much untouched – especially the primates. Now, our super-intelligent chimp from the first film, Caesar, is in charge of the local ape population just outside what remains of San Francisco. Him and his clan are living peacefully enough (under the mantra 'ape shall not kill ape') when they accidentally bump into a patrol of humans, scouting out the area with the view to repairing the local dam in order to restore power to the city. Let's just say that the two species never really see eye to eye.Despite the best efforts from Caesar and his human counterpart, Malcolm, (played by Jason Clarke) neither the apes and humans who they associate with want to get along. What follows is the gradual build-up from simple tension to outright hostilities between the two camps.If you have haven't seen the previous film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) I would definitely recommend watching that first. Granted, you will probably understand much of the sequel as a 'stand-alone' movie, it's best to watch them in order. That was you can chart the rise of the franchise's 'true star' – the computer-generated ape himself, Caesar. He's obviously created digitally, but performer Andy Serkis deserved much of the credit for bringing him to life. Never has a CGI character been so lifelike and easy to root for. In many cases, he even eclipses the 'proper' human actors. And, just for a bonus, you have Gary Oldman in there, who, as usual, turns in an excellent performance.It's not often that a blatant sci-fi movie can appeal to more than just 'the guys,' but I think this new franchises of 'apes' movies can be appreciated by quite a wide range of people. If you're looking for a sci-fi movie with heart, then you could do worse than the two 'apes' films. Of course it's not perfect, I did feel it dragged a little prior to the ending – the total runtime is about two hours and I think they could have shaved about quarter of an hour off that. But, apart from that, I enjoyed it. Looking forward to the next instalment. No way the film-makers would let the franchise die now!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
40,ThomasDrufke,Apes On Horses,9,10 July 2014,"The Planet of the Apes franchise has always fascinated me but I hadn't been interested until seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few years back. The emotional depth that that film brought to the table was unparalleled in terms of big blockbusters. I was attached to Caesar and several of the other apes. That movie surprised everyone so it isn't much of a surprise that the sequel 'Dawn' looked even better as they hired Matt Reeves as the replacement director. The special effects are some of the best I have ever seen and the acting was surprisingly outstanding. The trailers looked incredible so my excitement was about as high as it could possibly be for an apes movie. And the film doesn't disappoint.The film takes place at least 8 years after 'Rise' and the time jump is much to their benefit. It allowed Caesar to step into his role as leader of all the apes and link between the apes and humans. Speaking of the effects, some of the facial expression the apes gave were just devastating. And for me to say that I was on the verge of tears in a movie where apes can talk should sound absurd but its the truth. Caesar's family is present throughout and his eldest son is the one that hit home. When you see him being put into war unwillingly after life changing events you just cant but help feeling terrible for him. Koba, the corrupt ape who has always believed humans are more dangerous than Caesar thinks is also a conflicting character. There is a scene between him and Caesar near the first act that made me feel sympathy for him and whatever other apes were also tortured. Dreyfuss, played by Gary Oldman also stood out for the short periods that he appears. Much like Koba, he is a man who lost so much that he has lost faith in the world and wants nothing to do with the other species. It's these two characters who keep the conflict rising as peace is on the downfall and war is on the brink. The only real weak part of the film is that the trailers show a lot of the important scenes and I'm a guy who watches trailers everyday. I knew a little bit too much.To say that Caesar is one of the greatest leaders in film history is not an overstatement. When he is on screen you cant help but be mesmerized by the immense strength and gravitas that comes along with the character. Now it is time for the academy to honor the greatness that this film brings to all aspects of filmmaking. I wouldn't go as far as saying Serkis deserves a best actor nod, but I wouldn't disagree if they gave it to him. The performance is one for the ages.The third act is brilliant in every way a film should be. It was unexpected, visually dazzling, and emotionally fulfilling. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the get go. It's one of the best movies of the summer and definitely made it's mark in motion capture history.+Caesar's unparalleled leadership +Special effects and motion capture are just insanely good +Apes facial expressions can be emotionally devastating +Koba & Dreyfuss similarly troubled-I knew a bit too much from trailers 9.2/10SECOND VIEWING 9.6/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
41,Cineanalyst,Aped Humanism,6,4 April 2020,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is an improvement upon the first entry in the rebooted franchise, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011), although the distinctions are about as slight as the difference between their titles, of ""rise"" and ""dawn."" The CGI is better, the lighting and tone darker, and there's a more compelling balance of the shared humanism of ape and man. Although, granted, members of both species are simply either good or bad, and females get the short shrift--one a mother sick with baby, the other a doctor who lost her child and so helps mother become well with baby. Meanwhile, the males play politics and war, within and between species. There's a focus on the parallel between Cesar and his first born and a counterpart human father and son, which further recalls Cesar's upbringing by James Franco, scientist.The cinematography, although another improvement here, still seems rather rudimentary for a picture featuring largely CGI creatures that can climb and swing through environments. It's too bad the camera doesn't do the same, although there's a so-so tracking shot of the human male hero for one wartime scene. The climactic fight sequence is a let down. As for the opening, retracing the spread of the virus that wipes out most of humanity, it's an admittedly hackneyed sequence that cuts together clips from CNN of real-world disasters, images of well-known politicians like President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg, with fictional reports, but such is the reason I watched this movie now.

42,g-bodyl,Perfect Example of a Summer Blockbuster!,10,27 June 2015,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to the Planet of the Apes reboot, which turned out to be a surprise both in terms of reception and financial gains. Thankfully, this film expanded on the goodwill that film left behind and created one of the more moving, action-packed sequels in recent history. For every minute of action, there is a minute of emotion which I love in blockbusters. I love how the film focuses on the aspect of the chimps' lives and how they perceive the humans as a threat. The third act, however predictable, doesn't let up on the action. The one standout here, other than Caesar of course, is Koba. Koba is an angry monkey who lost his family at the hands of humans, and he will do everything he can to kill them all. Matt Reeve's film takes place years after the events of the first film. The chimps have created their own society, lead by Caesar. They believe the humans to have gone extinct. But after a chance encounter with some humans near their home, whom are lead by Malcolm, humans and monkeys start to battle each other to see who are the dominant species. The acting is really good. I wish James Franco returned, but luckily the people who took his place are just as good, if not better. Jason Clarke does a very fine job as Malcolm, one of the few humans who actually believe the humans can co-exist with the chimps. Keri Russell is decent as Malcolm's wife. Gary Oldman is back in top form as the sleazy leader of the human compound. On the monkeys side, Andy Serkis returns as Caesar and does a great job in one of his famous motion-capture roles. Toby Kebbell does a great job as the surprising menacing villains, Koba. Overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes proves that the first film was no fluke. When done right, this franchise can be very entertaining. The questions imposed on us is what would happen if any species other than humans would rule the world. This is a fine look at that answer. A very fun, action-packed movie that also has several key emotional scenes that flashbacks the first film in a memorable way. I am positively giddy in thinking about the third film, because the ending means good stuff will happen. My Grade: A+",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

To me the first movie seemed like a deeper and richer story that was full of emotion and excitement. This one did have some emotional aspects and did have much more action then the first one but to me it didn't feel as full in story as the other one. On the other hand though the different aspects of the war : human vs. ape, ape vs. ape and human vs. human is what really made the movie. It's also a little disheartening knowing that no matter what species or race you are it only takes one to being about an end.

47,atlasmb,Good CGI and an Engaging Story,8,21 July 2014,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is the latest chapter in the POTA franchise. I must admit that I had not seen any of the recent releases--those that rely heavily on CGI--until this one.If you are wondering whether or not this film stands on its own, it does. After a quick updating of the last film (Rise of...), the story advances without any confusion for the viewer.Since this film does use CGI extensively, let me say that the effects are extremely well done. In my opinion, the most difficult thing to pull of is to make apes on horseback look realistic and natural. They came as close to it as I think can be done.Another reasonable question might be: When so many of the characters are apes, are you really able to tell them apart easily? Again, yes. Visual cues are utilized, making it very easy to distinguish the ape characters. This might seem like a given, but it is essential to enjoyable viewing.The story itself is interesting and engaging. The relationship of ape to man is a touchy thing in this film, due to years of abuse and violence. There are those who wish a peaceful coexistence and those, naturally, who wish for war. Even as conflict ensues, opposing forces are at work. It is critical that the inter-ape communication and the inter-species communication be somewhat believable, and the script handles that issue well. There are subtitles when needed. Somehow, they never seem to interfere with the flow of the story.I recommend this film to almost anyone, subject to the PG-13 rating. Though violence is depicted, it is not gory. Nor is it championed. Instead, the film promotes peaceful communication and cooperation.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Even Barton's version had it. For some reason, it did not pull me into the story. As an outside observer, I have to acknowledge its greatness in all technical aspects, but the story itself left me indifferent. I wasn't moved by emotional scenes, didn't feel the tension of drama or adrenaline rush of action scenes. I watch and see it's all at a very high level, but I do not feel anything at all.

50,ironhorse_iv,Hail Caesar! Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is great!,8,14 July 2014,"This movie deserves the praise that it's been getting. It was so awesome very well acted, the visual/special effects are outstanding, and the action was breath-taking. Solid characters and story. Directed by Matt Reeves, the movie serves a sequel to 2011's film, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', which is a reboot of the original 1960/70s Planet of the Apes series. The movie takes place, a decade after the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity; the survivors of San Francisco are trying to rebuild society with power from a local dam. The only problem is that the dam is located, where Caesar (Andy Serkis) build a community of thousands of hunter apes. Seeing no way, around it, Dreyfus, (Gary Oldman), the leader of the human community wants to wipe out the apes community. Second in commander, Malcolm (Jason Clarke) thinks otherwise, and tries to seek out peace with Caesar. However, with mounting pressure from Dreyfus, as well as Caesar's own inner circle from Koba (Toby Kebbell), the two sides might end up in all-out war. A bloody war that Caesar and Malcolm is trying to prevent. Andy Serkis reprises his role as Caesar, as do the other actors who portrayed apes in the previous film, but no others. One thing, really missing in the film is James Franco's character of Will Rodman from the previous film. The last film spent some much thing investing in getting to know his character, only to have the sequel to reduce him as minor call back, with stock footage. You really never got to see, what happen to his character, and that of his girlfriend, Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto). The new human characters are just as bland and wooden as the previous movie was, with the extremely awkward dialogue. Gary Oldman as Dreyfus had too little scenes, in the film. At less, they try to make us emotional invested in his character, when you see him turn on the old IPAD. His final action was quite baffling too - not sure it made much sense given it didn't have much of an impact on the outcome either way. Jason Clarke was alright as Malcolm, but you could put James Franco's Will Rodman in the same role, and it would make the film, six times way better. It would be nice to see Will's conflict of trying to save humanity, while trying to save Caesar. Too bad, James Franco and the producers couldn't make a deal to return. Andy Serkis deserve praise for his role as Caesar. This movie is his movie! Too bad, the Oscars will probably not give him, a chance due to his motion-capture roles. You really see him, as a strong-leader here, challenging his inner King Kong. The CGI apes are so-much better than the previous film. It didn't look CGI, it look like they were really there. Mad props to them, able to create the illusion of wet fur. They look closer to what they look like they did in the 1968 film. Still, a bit too ""primitive"" for a society raise on a smart drug from a high-tech lab. Still, it kinda make sense, since Warpaint and feathers are easily obtained from the natural environment, are light and restrictive, and could serve as identity markers in a wooded/jungle environment where silence might be tactically advantage. The action scenes were way brutal than the previous film. It was nice to see them, put more action in this film, as the last one was indeed, lacking. Still, the whole assassination attempt was a bit rush. Koba was indeed pretty evil, but pretty damn clever. He plays on, Caesar and the human trust. There is a funny scene that remind me so much of a Youtube video of a monkey shooting AK-47 in Africa. Still, it was a bit unrealistic for human still have a hard time, believing that apes are indeed smart, when the last movie show them, hoping weapons and wrecking San Francisco, pretty aggression. I'm surprise that human never went looking for them for this long, when clearly they play a part in the Simian flu. The music score by Michael Giacchino is haunting to listen. Too bad, it's sounds too Dark Knight. I really tell the different. The movie had a lot of symbolism for social commentary. If you pay attention, you might see the graphic novel Black Hole by Charles Burn plays a role of the apes learning to trust the human. The story deals with the aftermath of a sexually transmitted disease which causes grotesque mutations in teenagers. The book was written in a time, where AIDS was killing millions of people around the world. Many believe HIV/AIDS came from apes, originated in non-human primates in Sub-Saharan Africa and transferred to humans. Yes, many believe that AIDS indeed, made in a lab like the Simian Flu. It makes you wonder. Some people might hate the movie, thinking it's offended to certain races. Many might view it as anthropomorphism movie about the plight of the black man from slaves, to dealing with racism, to gaining their freedom. The original 1968, Planet of Apes was an obvious allegory about race. Indeed, people might see that as well. Surprising, the movie does have a surprise end credits audio. Its hints that somebody might not be dead. Still, it was letdown, compare to the ending of the previous film. As of this writing, there are hints to that another movie will be made, and will indeed, be call 'Planet of the Apes'. This will be interesting, how they fit the whole Icarus plot in it. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, it's not for all children. Lots of frighten imagery. The 3D was rarely used. So check it out, in 2D. Overall: Monkey see monkey do. See the movie, indeed. You'll find it, very entertaining.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

52,Reno-Rangan,The fight for dominating the Earth.,7,12 July 2014,"The second movie in the rebooted 'The Planet of the Ape' series and the eighth movie in the franchise. After the excellent 2001 movie, it took a decade for a sequel. Long wait really looked worth and that success led to another quick sequel. I saw the night show before it makes debut in the next day. The crowd was in average number, but I did not bother for that and prepared to enjoy the show. Yes, I had a good time, but not a hundred percent satisfied. So I am going to tell what I liked and not.This story commence after 10 years from the previous movie 'Rise'. It is now post apocalypse and no one rules the world. The apes are living in a group peacefully in the wild. One day they encounter half a dozen of human survivors who are working out to put back the human dominance. The humans and apes do not want a war, but some people inside thirst for it because of the past suffers. Like the tagline, it is one last chance for peace. Does it work or not is what the movie tries to disclose.Have you seen the DisneyNature's 'Project Nim'? It is like what if something terrible happened to that project and Nim becomes a leader to his kind. Here it was Caeser who leads his race towards a fresh and civilized life. A leader must listen his followers and act according to the circumstances. In this story it reveals apes are not far behind in term of vengeance, betrayal and not believing in cooperation to build a better tomorrow together. It is all about the two different race wanted to dominate. This movie leaves a little clue before it conclude that next movie could be 'War of the Planet of the Apes'. I am already saying that will be a massive hit if it offers more action and especially to watch in digital 3D would be a treat for sure. Praying for it to hit the screen within the next two years of time.One thing I don't understand is that so far three movies were made in this series, but every time when the sequels are made the story leaps too much forward. Don't get confused, what I am saying was between these three movies the story won't follow exactly where the before one ended. It commences very much ahead where we have to wonder what might have happened in between the gaps. Yeah, they explain those in a commentary mode in the opening, but I always felt that was not enough. Though, few things make sense, like, somewhere somewhat it reveals the connection between them all.''It's just not about power! It's about giving us the hope to rebuild. To reclaim the world we lost.''Last time, I thought the characters from the first movie going to meet and it did not happen. So in this movie as well thought all of them come together and again the answer was no. Like I earlier said it leaps a long way without proper explanation. Every time new set of actors hops in like a reboot movie. It is not bad, but the story was just okay in this sequel, I mean not a genuinely written screenplay so I think that is why the popular names were missing in the cast. That is, they rejected the offer, I guess. When the press asked about that to the producer in an interview, he said the previous characters are all dead and the story moved on. But the real question is are you convinced by that? If you remember the first movie well like how it ended, somewhere Mark Wahlberg is going to come back in a future installment. That is what I have been expecting all the time.You know, this installment was largely ruled by animated ape characters. I can't say it was perfect, but almost. Those animated characters were in large numbers, I know the hard work behind, but still not convinced completely. Sometimes it looked made up of rubber and plastic than an organic body. World cinema is yet to give the best in that field. The master of motion capture performer, Andy Serkis had been brilliant like always. When there is a demand for character like this, he will be found in the front row. His skills really made those characters to display in a best way possible. So he was one of the highlights in the movie.When it came to the digital 3D, it was below par. Reason might be, it was a more dramatized story than filled with lots of actions and thrillers. Except in a couple of portion, the opening and the end scenes. In my experience this movie is not worth watching it in digital 3D. Since it was made as one you shall not say no to it because that is the future of the cinema and you should take part in the road it travelling.This movie was just good, not an awesome one like critics praising. The critics had a reason to do that, because they want 'Age of Extinction' fall behind so they are lifting this movie. For me, This movie was so simple, definitely not for who is looking for high octane stunt sequences and the story with twists. Entertainment is there and had great surround effects. I loved the first movie, the 2001 version and then the follow-up looked kind of afresh. So my rating kept falling movie after a movie in this series. Not in a large margin, but only by the fractions. Overall, one of the good movie that came in this mansoon.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
53,paulclaassen,"Good, but not as good as Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",6,2 July 2018,"Overlong and slow-moving at times, I did not find this film as interesting or exciting as 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. It is nevertheless an extraordinary film (and I think Caesar is one of the sexiest CGI creations ever!).",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
54,tomgillespie2002,Surpasses it's excellent predecessor,8,20 November 2014,"Very few expected 2011's reboot of a franchise - so clinically killed off by Tim Burton and his failure to grasp the idea of narrative sense - to be any good at all. Yet Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes was not only excellent as a thrilling action movie, but also carefully laid-out and thoughtful in it's scientific approach to the disease that ultimately led to apes conquering Earth and replacing humans as the planet's alpha species. Such a surprising success naturally leads to sequels, and when a director so acclaimed in his delivery of the first instalment fails to re- sign on, disaster is expected. But the apes have done it again, and not only does Dawn stay faithful to it's predecessor's code of story over cheap thrills, but it surpasses it in quality, gradually evolving into a serious study of war.Ten years after the events of the first film, most of humanity has been wiped out by ALZ-113 virus. The escaped apes from the first movie, namely chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis), bonobo Koba (Toby Kebbell, replacing Christopher Gordon), and orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval), are living peacefully in the woods believing the human race to be extinct. They communicate using sign language, though a few of them have learnt some words, and exist peacefully as a multi-ethical community. Caesar has two sons by Cornelia (Judy Greer) - Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and a newborn - and is the alpha with the facially and emotionally scarred Koba as his second-in- command.Unbeknownst to the apes, a small group of humans still dwell in the city, running out of the power supply that is keeping them alive. Led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the pack is living together in a huge building amongst the decaying city outside. A small expedition into the woods leads to trigger-happy member Carver (Oz's Kirk Acevedo) shooting an ape in the head in fear. Caesar and his extended army confront them, but Caesar's sympathetic view of humans leads to him allowing them to return to the city, demanding they leave in human speech. Malcolm is astonished at the ape's intelligence and charisma, and returns with his girlfriend (Keri Russell) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) to treat with him.The cinematography and set design are astonishing, The movie doesn't just give us a plastic apocalyptic world full of CGI-laden establishing shots, but a world that feels real and lived-in. And interacting in this world are some of the greatest special effects in the history of cinema. WETA have outdone themselves here, not only managing to blend motion-capture in an exterior environment seamlessly, but also allowing the actors behind the effects to act. A lot has been written about Serkis's portrayal of Caesar, and it is the actor's best performance to date, but Kebbell too manages to bring emotion and devastation to Koba's face, bringing an astonishing complexity to what could have been a stock antagonist. When the two interact, it feels real. You tend not to gasp at the effects because it simply feels like there aren't any.When the inevitable smack-down ensues, it's after some spellbinding drama. There's no cut-and-dry good and bad guys, just the inevitable roll towards blood-shed. There's blame on both sides in equal measure, and it comments heavily on both species' natural inclination to go to war. They live peacefully apart, but once they discover each other things start to fall apart out of desire, greed and most of all, fear. The action is utterly thrilling, and although it offers such treats as the sight of an ape firing two machine gun's whilst riding a horse, it's mainly because we are so engrossed in the character's stories. Serkis and Kebbell deserve Oscar recognition, but probably won't get it. Tim Burton's ghastly 2001 effort has been near-enough wiped from memory, and this new franchise will surely go from strength to strength.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
55,zkonedog,"Once Again, Apes Outshine Humans",3,4 March 2017,"When this franchise was re-booted a couple of years ago, I had high hopes for it. Though ""Rise"" was a middling movie by almost any description, it provided just enough ""canon"" moments for ""Ape-heads"" like myself to have hope for the future. A future in which an ape invasion of humans could be rendered visually believable, which is what ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" portends to do. On a strictly technically basis, it comes through with flying colors. One can indeed see a believable interpretation of a human/ape war. The problem? It tells such a boring story along the way.For a basic plot summary, ""Dawn"" picks up a number of years after ""Rise"" ends. In the future, humans are decimated by a simian flu (thank you, Big Pharmacy!) and down to pockets of existence. When the San Francisco band of humans (led by Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman) ventures into the redwood forests to power up a hydroelectric dam, they stumble upon a community of apes led by Caesar (Andy Serkis), who has the advanced power of speech as previous developed. Tensions run high between human and ape, with one wrong move threatening to start an all-out war.In the ""old school"" ape films, there is most definitely a ""buy-in"" level, as the ""apes"" are clearly actors in monkey suits. While likely not a problem for sci-fi buffs (like myself), others may not have the imagination for such a ""reach"". With today's movie technology, however, an ape rebellion looks very, very real, with apes swinging through trees and learning new skills as they evolve. No long does one have to imagine the apes taking over planet Earth...you can watch it happen!Sadly, there is NOTHING else interesting going on in this film. You thought James Franco's character was a bit wooden in the first one? ""Dawn"" is oh so much worse. Not a single human character is even remotely interesting, and the plot is about as bland as one can get away with in such a high-profile release. Never once did I feel as if I truly cared about anything that was transpiring up on the screen (aside from a few of the ""ape action"" scenes, of course).Let me put it to you this way: In the film ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", Caesar the talking ape rallies his simian friends to begin a chaotic riot in the first steps towards breaking their human bondage. At the end of that tension-filled riot, Roddy McDowell (Caesar) gives an epic, hair-raising speech proclaiming ""tonight begins the planet of the apes!"". There is not one second of ""Dawn"" that even approaches that sort of high drama. Instead, it is a palate of great special effects tagged with a lousy script/characters. I was really excited about the potential of this new ""Apes"" franchise going in, but this clunker has significantly dulled that enthusiasm.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
56,Floated2,Thought provoking drama,7,2 August 2015,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the critical acclaimed film to the successful sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes released in 2011. This film is more so less different than the original, which Dawn is all about the apes. Caesar, Koba and Maurice (Karin Konoval) are just wonderful characters and are in many ways are lot more nuanced than their generally clichéd human counterparts. The scenes with Caesar and his family: wife Cornelia (Judy Greer), son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and their newly born son are genuinely moving and the way the apes have developed their language skills from the last film, completely convincing. The film is called Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to put it in its place, one would know where the story is heading but what a wonderful world to lose yourself in for two hours, however as the film goes towards the end, one is less interested in the overall tone of the film. The apes were far from interesting as we have seen it before.I have read somewhere that this film felt as a documentary and I agree completely with that comment. The notion of this as a documentary feel is what separates this to the original, and which is why I felt the original Rise of the Planet of the Apes was more enjoyable, fun and overall entertaining. Dawn isn't a bad film, but the overwhelming hype it has taken has reduced its value for me. Overall the film does have good acting and directing, great visuals, but the story is lacking and the tone of the film isn't too entertaining as a watch.- - - - - -As a rewatch 11/03/21' this film is a lot better on another viewing with paying closer attention to detail. It is more detail and longer in runtime than its previous film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), and the tone is noticeably more serious. Dawn is more focused on the apes but we see character development and get a better sense of the characters. Jason Clarke as the lead is quite dull and bland, as are the other human characters bit more focus is on the apes. The story had a rather slow build but once the action comes into place, it becomes highly entertaining. Prefer Rise to Dawn but this film is still very good. Rating changed from 4 to 7.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
57,eddie_baggins,"A movie worth going ""Ape"" over",8,13 July 2014,"It's strange in many ways yet satisfying in an industry sense that perhaps for the first or at least most noticeable time in movie history we have a film in which CGI creations well and truly overrule all human counterparts, for in Matt Reeves perfectly constructed follow up to Rupert Wyatt's well-loved predecessor Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes use of computer wizardry, motion capture technology and motion capture performances culminate in what could be the year's best Blockbuster.In a film filled to the brim with memorable scenes and primate characters, Dawn's cherry on it's very nice top sitting alongside its stunning CGI by the ever amazing Weta group is the outstanding performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar, leader of the apes and most advanced of all the hairy kind. Serkis as Caesar is the perfect molding of character, actor and technology, with Caesar now arguably the greatest ever mo-cap creation right up there with Serkis's other creations Gollum, King Kong and yes even those ever blue Navi's in Cameron's money making machine Avatar. From the close up opening through to the films satisfying conclusion, Caesar (along with his compatriots including the equally praiseworthy Toby Kebbel as Caesar's right hand man Koba) feels completely real, an ape that feels fear, longs for love and fights for family, Caesar is for all sakes and purposes real within this film and real to the audience. While Serkis as Caesar and the apes that follow are reason enough to venture out to the multiplex and catch Dawn it all would have all amounted to nothing if it were not for Reeve's steady hand behind the camera and the story of this newly envisioned Apes universe joining the quality party.Reeves has been working in the industry for some time now, making his debut in 1996 as a feature length director yet not reaching his potential until found footage Sci-Fi Cloverfield made a splash in 2008. On the back of that JJ Abrams led production and following on from the under-appreciated horror Let Me In, Reeves here shows a coming of age as director with an often inspired touch behind camera leading to some of the year's most impressively staged set pieces. Moments within the film such as the Ape's charge on the human stronghold or smaller tense moments such as Malcolm (played by Australian Jason Clarke) venturing into building overrun by some angry apes highlighting that fact that Reeves is indeed the man to take this franchise forward. While Reeves and his Ape chargers are all quite faultless there is no questioning that the film overall is brought back a peg or to by some pretty cookie cutter human participants.Led by the aforementioned Clarke as family man Malcolm the humans struggle to remain relevant in the picture that dedicates far for more effort into the growing of the Ape legion. While Clarke is in no way bad, his reluctant hero Malcolm is far from the human lead the picture needed to jump into near perfect Blockbuster fare. With supports from the underused Kodi Smit-McPhee (the Australian youngster now well and truly grown up) as Malcolm's son Alexander, the lame Kerri Russell as token love interest Ellie and the increasingly over the top and voice raising Gary Oldman as human leader Dreyfus, all human's fail to register on the interest scale or likability scale, again all culminating in the fact that our CGI beasts are the ones we are rooting for.Dawn is by far the most impressive big budget movie unleashed so far this year. A movie that is at many times thrilling, sometimes scary and hugely impressive on a technical level, Dawn is another positive step forward in a franchise that has all of a sudden on the back of these 2 newest additions become one of the most promising properties in the Hollywood canon and if the humans can match our beloved Apes in the next installment, the results will be quite mind-blowing.4 angst ridden teenage apes out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
58,poe426,Great Apes greater than ever...,10,12 July 2014,"DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, like PACIFIC RIM, is so realistically rendered that the fx hold up to microscopic scrutiny; every computer-generated moment was worth the price of admission, from the shot of the darkened continent at the beginning to the shot of the massed cgi simians at the end. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES has set a whole new Standard for cgi and the superstars of those cgi have given us the most convincing cinematic simians since Peter Jackson's KING KONG. For my money, it's Koba (who ""learned Hate from Humans"") who steals the show (while I can't cite the performance of an actor, I CAN sing the praise of the aforementioned superstars of cgi, who rendered the character so 100% believably). If this is the future of Great Filmmaking, so be it. I'm now on board with it. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES benefits greatly, too, from some solid storytelling (although it IS essentially a remake of BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES, the lesser of the original five films); and it's never predictable in terms of the shots we see: everything looks and feels absolutely Brand New, an almost impossible achievement, one would think, given that it IS a remake. The idea of the Apes signing was a stroke of genius because that's how Apes HAVE been taught to communicate (lending the proceedings an air of authenticity). When it comes to the ARTICULATION, Koba again rates top honors: his inflections have the hyper-delivery of the True Primitive in all his rage. (And Koba is ultimately the most tragic of all the Great Apes, having first been abused by and then ""lied to"" by Humans. If nothing else, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the revenge tale of Koba.) Like PACIFIC RIM, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES absolutely MUST be seen on The Big Screen.

59,filipemanuelneto,The promised sequel.,6,20 April 2017,"""Planet of the Apes: Revolt"" is the promised sequel to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", both of which are based on Pierre Boulle's dystopic book. Now humans are a minority, a race facing extinction (what an irony!) that apes seem to be able to seriously threaten. The contact between them reminded me of the difficult and dangerous understanding between different communities when distrust prevails. We can imagine something similar in moments of our past, like the first contact between European navigators and indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example. Distrust, fear, displays of power to intimidation... the film shows these in a very interesting way, with the apes being very similar to us, in behavior and way of think. Unfortunately, the whole film is quite pretentious and full of self-importance: both sides have an exaggerated awareness of the relevance of events to their own community. This is the most boring point of the movie. The actors do a good job, but non-human characters get more interest and dominate the scene. Technically, the film doesn't deserve major criticism. CGI is more cautious than in the first movie and seems more real. Sequences of combat and action are breathtaking, certainly pleasing to those who seek action and adventure.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
60,leonblackwood,Brilliant! 7/10,7,11 January 2015,"Review: Now that I've finally watched this movie, I must admit, it is brilliant but it does take a bit of time to get going. The apes look amazing and there face expressions and mannerisms were excellent but after hearing all of the hype, I was slightly disappointed with the whole pace of the film. I loved what the director done with Caesar's character and the relationships with the various apes and humans was interesting and a joy to watch. I couldn't help but thinking that the movie might have been better if the director would have got some top class actors to work alongside the apes, but thats just my honest opinion. Anyway, the whole humans against apes concept was well put together and I couldn't wait for the Caesar vs. Koba showdown, which didn't disappoint. Its definitely a must watch for all movie goers and I can't wait for the next instalment which has been built up to me a major blockbuster like this one. Great!Round-Up: Jason Clarke, who plays Caesar's human friend, has a unique style of acting which isn't for everyone's taste. He has a distant screen presence which can easily make you forget that he was in a film. He's starred in movies like The Great Gatsby, Lawless and White House Down but I doubt that anyone can remember him in those films. He's also got a role in the new Terminator Genisys movie so he's obviously a actor that's in popular demand at the moment. Personally, I would have cast Gary Oldman as the lead in this film because it could have done with some emotion and depth but judging by the movies takings, it didn't really matter who played the lead. Andy Serkis has become the puppet master when it comes to playing CGI characters. His amazing movements and mannerisms as Gollum and King Kong, really made those movies great and with the new Star Wars and Avengers in the pipeline, there's no turning back for this unique actor.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $709millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama movies about an ape colony fighting against the humans to save there humanity. 7/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

62,matthewssilverhammer,"Complex Characters, Thrilling Adventure, Big Brains, and Deep Soul",9,22 July 2014,"Director Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) continues his hot streak with DotPotA, a sequel to the emotional and financial success from 2011. The premise (apes behaving and communicating like humans) remains terrifying for us hominids, but we continue to root for our supposed ""enemies"". It's a dark and scary film, not without moments of levity, which overcomes some clunky expositional dialogue with huge heapings of heart. Throw in one of the greatest characters in all of scifi (Serkis's Caesar), and a truly memorable villain, Dawn is an intense success. Ten years after the first film, Earth has fallen into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. Humans are dying off from spreading disease, and apes are advancing. This sets the stage for a much larger scale story than the first, dealing with temporary peace treaties and growing dissonance between worlds. So much of the film works, but aesthetics may be its shining point. The ape effects are still pretty spectacular, with the ever-competent Serkis doing some of his best work. There are amazing fire motifs, breathtaking destruction, inventive cinematography, and sets that are beyond fantastic. All of which leads to an end battle that pays offfull of personality and exhilaration. Now, like the first the human characters aren't the strongest aspect of the film, although they are improved here. The filmmakers seem more focused on the complexities of the apes. ""Good"" and ""bad"" never painted in broad strokes, apes being simultaneously heartbreaking, scary, and integral.

63,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Apes"" does it again with riveting emotional storytelling",9,26 July 2014,"Four years ago you never could've predicted that ""Planet of the Apes"" would be rebooted to critical and financial acclaim, let alone become perhaps the most promising franchises born after 2010. If ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a consummate origin story, then ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a consummate next step in a larger story, and proof that a movie franchise can evolve more gradually and still be grippingly entertaining.The sequel picks up well after the end of ""Rise,"" which implied that a simian virus wiped out a large portion of the earth's population. At this point, the apes have established a village outside San Francisco and their intelligence has grown (as has main ape Caesar's vocabulary). When a band of human survivors stumbles across some of the apes, Caesar (played fabulously once more by leading mo-cap actor Andy Serkis) confronts the colony of human survivors (led by Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman) and issues a stern warning to the humans to let the apes live in peace. However, the apes' home is situated next to a dam — the humans' only hope for a power source and theoretically their only way to survive.""Rise"" writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver return and they've remarkably crafted a story as straightforward, suspenseful and emotional as the original (with some help from 20th Century Fox A-list screenwriter Mark Bomback). The entire movie we wait for the other shoe to drop as humans and apes must get along but don't entirely trust each other, and a few dark characters on both sides undermine the good guys: Caesar and Clarke's Malcolm.Caesar is the linchpin of this series. James Franco's character not being part of it says everything you need to know. The fact that the movie spends more time acquainting us with the ape characters than the human ones demonstrates that the creatives behind the film know it too. They should pass that information along to Paramount for the ""Transformers"" franchise.The story is packed with character-building, suspense, painful misunderstandings, betrayal, hope, violence and justice. You really feel the roller coaster ride of the story in your guts, a vicarious feeling that too few blockbusters create, even the really entertaining ones. Caesar is the kind of character that all blockbusters should have and he's entirely done in CGI. That tells you just how crucial good storytelling is to creating characters. They don't have to be human. Not to take anything away from Serkis' brilliance, but Jaffa and Silver should teach a class on screen writing that should be mandatory for the rest of Hollywood's big studio writers. They way they create empathy and stick to basic storytelling tenants in a crude yet effective way is so laudable. And undoubtedly Bomback (""Unstoppable,"" ""The Wolverine"") helped ratchet up the entertainment factor.Director Matt Reeves picks up on all these terrific moments in the script and nurtures them. He lets the plot breathe and gives it time to snowball, and by the time it does, the audience is so invested in the outcome that the ending doesn't have to be great, it just has to give us what we want, which it does. ""Dawn"" is also thematically stronger than ""Rise,"" taking the idea of both apes and humans having both good and evil tendencies to the next level. It's elementary stuff about human (and ape) nature but in this premise it clicks especially well. Through the eyes of a growing civilization of apes and humanity rebuilding we see the chance for a fresh start for human and ape-kind in, which makes the conflict between them so maddening throughout the film yet also riveting.""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" propels the slow-build of this franchise to the point that it almost feels more like a first entry than a second. That's a good thing. So often franchises work in trilogies, but Fox could turn this into a four-film arc easily with the right story. So far, however, the scope has been kept small, allowing for character moments and that emotional connection. They will have an opportunity to blow the lid off everything, but hopefully Fox has learned a thing or two and will continue to make this about Caesar rather than just a war of apes and humans.~Steven CThanks for reading!

65,taylorkingston,A pretty great movie...,9,25 April 2015,"Now, I like this movie. I really do. However, I do like Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes more. But then again, they're completely different movies. One's a prequel to an apocalypse and one is an apocalypse. I do think this movie is a very good sequel to Rise and it holds up strong. The acting is great and the effects are terrific. This movie is based about eight years after Rise, where a virus got out and killed almost the entire population of the planet. There aren't many people left, those who are live in a sectioned off area and try to make the best of things. The apes, including Caesar from Rise, live up in the trees as a family. Caesar now has two children and Maurice has taught and continues to teach all the apes sign language. When humans unknowingly walk into their territory, Caesar tells them to leave. But when they come back, because they need to use the dam, where the apes are, Caesar agrees to let them work, but they need to leave right after and never come back. When humans start to fight against the apes, he tells them that he doesn't want a war, but he will fight in one. Then an ape betrays Caesar, trying to kill him, and stuff just gets crazy. The end leads into another sequel.Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
66,billcr12,Apes vs Humans,7,25 October 2017,"The apes are back once again, and this time they are riding horses. They also have automatic weapons. The apes are led by Caesar, a really smart monkey who speaks English. Andy Serkis is the actor under all the makeup and he is excellent. The only recognizable actress is Keri Russell, best known for the TV series, Felicity. The apes live near a dam which is needed by the humans for electricity. Of course, it all leads to a bloody war between the two groups. The scenery is spectacular and the script well written. The biggest problem is the two hour and ten minute running time. The film is just too long. Otherwise, it is a pretty good movie.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

A great follow up to Rise of the Planet of the Apes(2011), Andy Serkis really gives a great performance as Cesar the CGI ape, they should give him an Oscar. And the rest of the cast are pretty good also, action scenes are pretty intense, and the apes look so real, you'll forget there CGI. Gary Oldman and Keri Russell are good in there supporting roles.

68,PWNYCNY,Can humans and apes learn to be friends?,8,17 July 2014,"Despite the heavy reliance on special effects, the movie features some good acting and manages to tell a story. That being the case, the movie has a major problem: the apes simply are not anthropomorphic enough to inspire empathy. As one of the humans, referring to the apes, says in the movie: ""They are animals!"" And he is correct. Unlike the original Planets of the Apes movies, in which the apes have actually become civilized, in this movie they are still animals ... and act like animals too. Instead of being worthy adversaries, they are vermin. True, the apes mimic some features of human behavior, but it comes off as entirely contrived. The movie sets up a conflict between the humans and apes that tests the limits of plausibility. The movie asks the audience to accept the premise that apes have feelings too, which is probably true of all animals. But when the movie also asks the audience to accept another premise, that apes are of equal intelligence as humans, then the movie becomes a fantasy. The scene showing a chimpanzee and a human being bonding as friends and equals is asking a lot from the audience which has to believe that cross-species friendship, based on equality, is possible. Even more preposterous are the scenes of hordes of chimpanzees fighting like soldiers, operating complex weapons and under a single commander. As much as one may want to sympathize with the rage of the apes, they're still animals. Yet, if one buys into the political implications of this movie, that the apes in fact have a legitimate gripe, then the story has some substance. One could even feel sorry for the apes who simply want to be left alone. Then again, the same could be said for a long list of species and for many human cultures as well that are now extinct. They only wanted to be left alone.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
69,stevendbeard,Great Seqel to a Reboot,7,11 July 2014,"I saw ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", starring Andy Serkis-Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies, King Kong in King Kong_2005; Jason Clarke- White House Down, Zero Dark Thirty; Keri Russell-The Americans_t.v., Mission:Impossible 3 and Gary Oldman-Robocop_2014, Dracula_1992. This is a sequel to a reboot. It's a sequel to the Rise of the Planet of the Apes_2011, which is a reboot of the Planet of the Apes films that started in 1968-I think there were about 5 or 6 of them but I lost count. Anyway, this one takes place about a decade after Rise, with Andy using motion capture to portray Caesar, who is the ape in charge of a group of apes living in the woods outside of San Francisco. A deadly simian virus has just about wiped out all humans; with small groups that were immune to the virus-for some reason or another-gathering in powerless cities, such as San Francisco. Gary is in charge of that group of humans and Jason and Keri are a married couple that are scientists that are trying to find a cure for the virus. There is a dam that Jason wants to get up and running so that they can get back to being civilized, but wouldn't you know it? The dam is smack dab in the middle of ape occupied woods. There are humans that hate the apes as well as apes that hate the humans, which begs the question, 'Are apes really that much different from humans and can't we all just get along?' There is a video showing James Franco from the Rise, with a young Caesar, but there is no new footage of James. The motion capture is really well done throughout the whole movie and when the movie ends, you have no doubt that there will be another sequel. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

In this installment, Caesar and his entourage take refuge but it is threatened by a group of human survivors who need electrical power to survive; the problem is the plant is near Caesar's crib; but Caesar informs them ""I Got the Power""!!!

71,drqshadow-reviews,"Firm, Fiery and Intelligent, But Perhaps a Bit Too Safe",7,31 July 2014,"Set a full ten years after the events of its predecessor, the latest Apes picture has humanity near extinction while Caesar and his ever-expanding family have established a functional utopia amidst the desolation. Most of the first act is a simple, enveloping visual treat - establishing the world as it now stands and savoring the unique visuals of San Francisco (and the surrounding area) in the aftermath of a near-total human annihilation event. Crumbling cityscapes, creeping plant life, reverberations of a lost civilization... this story lends itself nicely to vivid, poignant splashes of scenery, and the effects team is more than up to that challenge. In fact, moving on from that slow, thoughtful series of reflections is a feat the film struggles with. Though rich and layered in its own ways, the story plays second-fiddle to the mood at large, and often feels telegraphed by the events of the first film (not to mention the original series). It's a deep, thought provoking installment, with some lights-out physical acting from the entire motion-capture cast, but I couldn't shake the sense that it could have stretched itself much further than it did. When it came time for the parallel climactic face-offs amidst the fireworks of an unavoidable human/ape warzone, I kept thinking to myself, ""Is this really all there is?"" Firm, fiery and intelligent, but perhaps a bit too safe, too happy to fall back on a set of standard action movie routines. Beautifully dark, it's also a decided step down from the promise seen in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
72,alindsay-al,An excellent sequel that improves on the first film,10,26 May 2015,"I loved rise of the planet of the apes and I was really excited to see dawn of the planet of the apes and this is one of the best dramatic films I have seen in a while. This film takes place 10 years after rise and a virus and civil war has wiped out most of humanity and the apes are living on their own. When circumstances force the two factions meeting hostilities ensue which could lead to either peace or war. Now andy serkis is one of the best actors in the business and his performance as Caesar is amazing in this film. I feel like he is one of the most interesting characters in all of film and you care more about an ape then you do about the majority of human characters in all of film. He is an ape but he is incredibly relatable and an awesome character. Now to the rest of the cast, Jason Clarke plays the lead human and I liked his character he was decent in the film even though he really isn't that important to the film because the real hero of the film is caesar. Similarly Gary Oldman plays one of the leaders of the humans and in the trailers it made out that he was just a true villain but he was really relatable and you understand his motivations as he has lost everything but in truth he really isn't in the film that much. Now the show stealer of the film is The ape koba you see the conflict between him and Caesar and once again you understand kobas motivations and understand why he does what he does in this film. Now I enjoyed seeing the two different factions and how when they interact it leads to Friction which is exactly like it should be. The best thing about this film is that it starts off looking like a simple story but it takes turns that you don't expect and it leads to be a phenomenal story that says allot about society and how people react to the unknown which was really interesting. The script is really good because this is a real drama and the script showed this with the dialogue that pulls at the heartstrings. Also once again giving credit to the directions the film takes to make it much better. The style is phenomenal we have the cgi apes but they look real and you feel like these apes are real which is the biggest compliment I can ever give. Also all the action is the step up needed from the first film and I loved every action scene in this film. Overall this was an epic sequel that needs to be seen by everybody.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
73,estebangonzalez10,The Apes are back!,8,20 July 2014,"""Apes together strong!""A decade has passed since the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (Rupert Wyatt's 2011 film that successfully rebooted this once beloved franchise from the late 60's) and now we find ourselves in a completely different world. The genetically evolved apes have built a new home in the San Francisco woods and continue to be led by Caesar (Andy Serkis). They communicate through sign language and several can speak. The simian virus that broke out at the end of the first film has practically wiped out the human race and it's been two years since Caesar or any of the apes have seen any human activity. But there are survivors living in the ruins led by a man named Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and in order to restore power they need to gain access to a nearby hydroelectric dam in ape territory. Caesar's lieutenant, Koba (Toby Kebbell) hates humans and recommends killing them, but Caesar is wise and wants to avoid war. He gives a few men, led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), permission to work on the dam only for a few days, but this short lived time of peace hangs on a very thin thread.Matt Reeves was given the director's chair for this sequel and he doesn't disappoint. It's just as entertaining and smart as Wyatt's Rise. There have been several strong blockbusters that have come out this year and Dawn deserves to be considered among the best. What this film does right is focus on the apes allowing us to sympathize with their cause. Andy Serkis delivers a powerful performance once again and he owns this movie, although I would have to say that Kebbell's Koba is so memorable that he may just be the best villain in a film this year. The humans don't get much attention in this film so of course there is very little character development going on with them. Jason Clarke plays the most sympathetic character and perhaps the only human worth carrying about in this film. I was a bit disappointed that Gary Oldman wasn't given more screen time or a heavier role. Reeves also cast Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee with whom he worked with in Felicity and Let Me In respectively, but they don't have much to work with here either. The true stars of the film are the apes and there is a significant upgrade in the CGI compared to Rise. The apes look and move in an authentic manner. Dawn has everything going for it, great visuals, a fantastic score, a smart script, and some fantastic action scenes. We spend so much time with these advanced apes that by the time we see them riding on horses and carrying machine guns the entire premise seems plausible. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare smart blockbusters where the action and visual aren't the only aspect of a film that has been given some thought. The apes are given personalities and the tension between the two sides is palpable. It isn't just a lame excuse to give us great visuals and cool looking action scenes; it is much more complex than that, and by doing so it creates much more tension. We are entertained just as much as we are forced to think. They have managed to turn a franchise I really didn't care for at first into an engaging and gripping one without ceasing to entertain the audience. When you spend some time creating believable and complex characters and combine them with cool looking action scenes you have the recipe for a successful movie that will leave audiences entertained and engaged at the same time. Their eyes won't be the only thing that are blown away, but their minds as well. And that is what Reeves and his team have managed to do with this franchise. It is sort of a Shakespearean drama combined with fantastic action scenes that are shot really well (there is a rotating shot from the point of view of a tank that was spectacular). I had a great time and I'm sure most audiences will as well.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
74,Fluke_Skywalker,Monkeys shine,7,12 July 2014,"The plot for writer/Director Matt Reeves' 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is not a particularly complex or intricate one, but the simple and straightforward story is deftly executed. The solid cast further embellish it with a collectively genuine performance that helps to ground the fantastical setting and make it feel real. The real stars here, however, are the titular Apes. Not only is the bulk of the film centered around them, the motion capture technology and special effects that bring them to life is beyond anything we've seen before. These are real characters, giving real performances, and they look, act and feel every bit as real as their human counterparts. It's a phenomenal achievement. One worthy of an Academy award.Though it does drag in spots, offers no real surprises, and lays the melodrama on a bit thick at times, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is a thoughtful piece of popcorn entertainment, and well worth checking out.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

But CGI is ruining movies. (And photography in general) How can we ever believe photographic evidence in a court case, for instance? As I had expected this film was a racial allegory, and we were apparently supposed to be rooting for the apes. Although the filmmakers did at least add some complexity, making some of the apes, as well as the humans, venal and power-hungry. The acting performances of the human characters were adequate but nothing special. As for the apes, you can't really say much with the actors so covered up. The plot sinks through massive holes. For example, weapons in armories are not stored loaded, and people, much less intelligent animals, who are unfamiliar with guns will never figure out how to load them. Cannot recommend this film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
77,jimbo-53-186511,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an engaging film and a great expansion of the story,8,21 December 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is set 10 years after the events that occurred in the first film. This film focuses on a group of human survivors and a colony of apes that have also settled close by. A small group of survivors bump into a couple of apes whilst they are heading towards a dam - they need access to this dam as this is where the main power for the city is located. However, the Apes do not trust the humans and warn them to stay away. Undeterred, group leader Malcolm (Jason Clarke) pays another visit to the apes and asks if they can access the dam in order for them to bring power to the city. The leader of the Apes Caesar agrees, but on the condition that the humans surrender their guns. Initially there is peace between the apes and the humans, but Koba (an ape that was tortured by humans during the previous pandemic) does not trust humans and, against Caesar's orders, begins a war against the humans.Personally, I thought this film was better than Rise simply because it moves much more quickly. I found the first half of Rise to be somewhat slow and ponderous - the second half was fantastic, but I just felt that there was a bit too much filler at the start. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets going immediately; we have the breath-taking opening sequence (the visuals in this film like the first film are simple incredible), the early showdown between the apes and the humans. This sequel hooks you in from the start and the writers never allow you to become bored or to become detracted from the story.The other thing I liked about this sequel is that the writers continue to make you care about all the characters; I liked Caesar in the first film and continue to like him in this film. He's not too submissive, but he's also not completely unreasonable - he's actually a very good leader. Because I liked and cared for Caesar's character it also meant that I cared what happened to him - I was a little bit upset when Koba shot Caesar (although it was predictable that Caesar would be OK). It's thanks to good writing though that we end up caring for the characters. I think the most moving moments in the film were when Caesar was looking at old video footage and old photos from when he was a child (this was when he was laid up after being shot by Koba).The other key character in DOTPOTA is Koba; Koba begins as a somewhat sympathetic character, but unlike many of the other apes he's unable to forgive and forget(which is perhaps understandable given the fact that he was probably treated a lot worse than many of the other apes). He believes that all humans are evil and that killing all humans are key to the survival of the apes. I was actually quite shocked by how evil Koba could be; he even used Caesar's supposed death as an excuse to start a war against the humans even though he was the one that shot Caesar and this is also how he befriends Caesar's son. Koba was a great villain and his disturbing antics certainly made the film entertaining.In summary, DOTPOTA is an excellent sequel that is entertaining, moving, well-acted, visually gorgeous, with a story that is engaging throughout. I thought that the first film was OK, but this sequel is much better.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The clever and deeply impactful story surrounding the race of sentient apes was surprisingly very human and the catalyst for a profoundly emotional storyline that is so intricately detailed in depicting the apes complexity in all its blazing glory that it goes well beyond the parameters of a simple blockbuster and into the territory of a more sophisticated grand epic!One could argue the human characters were not fleshed out and my response would be the new civilization of apes act like a mirror and reflect the very best and worst of mankind.. the whole film is a commentary on mankind for that matter!But I think there is one area we can all agree Gary Oldman's talents were totally wasted!Naughty Approved!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

80,3xHCCH,Simian Supremacy,9,13 July 2014,"I went to watch this film with very high expectations. There was so much acclaim in all these initial reviews that have come out. Everyone extols it as THE best film of this summer. My sons and I went to watch it even if the only screening we can watch at that time was in more expensive 3D. This 3D turned out to be unnecessary, but this film is deserving of all its advanced praise.The story of ""Dawn"" picks up ten years after the events of the first film ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" Simian flu we saw developed and spread in the first film has now all but decimated most of the human population. In the forests, the mutant apes have established their own system, led by the alpha male ape Caesar.When a group of survivors enter the forest in order to reactivate an old dam for their energy needs, they meet the apes' wrath. There arose a battle of loyalty, trust and betrayal in both the human and the ape organizations, escalating into a deadly battle royale in the streets of San Francisco.For a summer blockbuster rich in computer-generated visual effects, ""Dawn"" is actually a very serious film. The first two acts had more words (many of them written in subtitles) than action, and may make some of the younger viewers impatient. The final act is an action spectacle that will undoubtedly be long remembered with its graphic yet poetic images of warfare. This sequel is really more about the apes than the humans. The humans were delimited to playing one-dimensional characters with hardly any back story. The lead human character Malcolm, who was assigned to lead the dam repairs, was played by Jason Clarke. He went on his mission with his doctor girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The leader of the human settlement is Dreyfus, played by Gary Oldman. You will hate him for what he is saying, but upon reflection, that is typical human behavior that he represents.But the apes were a different matter. They were all so well-delineated. Each face was different and all so expressive. The actors behind each ape deserve special mention for managing to evoke emotion from beneath make-up and motion capture technology. Tony Kebbel as the tortured Koba, Karin Konoval (a female) as the intellectual orangutan Maurice, and Nick Thurston as Caesar's impetuous eldest son Blue Eyes. Above all, there is the amazing Andy Serkis as Caesar, the quintessential leader of the apes. This is indeed an award-deserving performance.That is not to say that this film was absolutely perfect. There were some aspects which puzzled me. There seems to be so much more being written in the subtitles than what the apes were signing or gesturing on screen. I know that that scene where Caesar was back in the house of his old friend and trainer Will (James Franco) was nice and sentimental. But it strains logic that a long-abandoned video camera would still have two bars in its battery life. In the bigger scheme of things though, these are minor quibbles.You should go into this film NOT as you would go into a typical summer blockbuster film. You should prepare your frame of mind before you watch this. This film is not fun, entertaining, nor uplifting. Instead this is dark, thought-provoking and disturbing. There is no denying though that this film is a technological triumph in the area of visual effects, sound effects, film editing, musical scoring, cinematography and its effective direction under Matt Reeves.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
81,aharmas,We're Not That Different from Each Other,9,11 July 2014,"""Dawn"" explores new territory in the evolution of a new world society. Its prequel explained the origins of the new breed of apes and explored issues of genetics and experiments on animals, particularly apes. One of the most memorable scenes in movie history has him speaking at the end of that movie, and it's a chilling moment. Overall, the film is pretty good and sets up this amazing second chapter.This is a remarkable film because it gives a detailed look at Caesar's world, and its differences and similarities between them and our world. Because of a tragic turn of events, they're more similar than one expects: they both seek survival and fear each other. Caesar has put together a society where things seem to be working for the most part, except there is a bit of turmoil originating from a few disgruntled members, including Caesar's son and most importantly, Koba. Koba reminds us of some of the most radical members of our own society, and to balance things out, there is Dreyfuss (Oldman), an army man who is a leader of sorts in San Francisco protection agencies, a complex character that becomes key in the final third of the movie.We know from the beginning that fear makes people become irrational and reckless, and since both species are more similar than either would like, mistakes are made, revolutions start, and key figures are threatened or killed. Caesar himself becomes the target of a maneuver instigated by a member of his own tribe. Things deteriorate, leading us to see one of the most spectacular battles in movies. With the help of special effects, striking image after striking image remind us of the power of the movies.Still, nothing would work if the acting, writing, editing, and directing weren't in place. Andy Serkis shines again in a very difficult role. He commands the screen as the dignified leader who must rule a new type of world. He's a complex figure who is loyal to his kind but can't forget his attachment to people in his past. His eyes are certainly spectacular. He has probably topped his work in ""King Kong"" and ""LOTR"".The film takes its place as the best of the year so far. Hopefully people will honor it accordingly when awards are given.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
82,peterp-450-298716,"Superbe,breathtaking CGI ... but a normal chimpanzee could predict the outcome.",7,6 November 2014,"""I always think... ape better than human. I see now... how much like them we are."" After the magnificent ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" from 2011, Caesar the legendary ape who started the revolution for his species, can show up again in this sequel. It's 10 years later and the world has been decimated thanks to the Simian virus. This flu originated from a genetically engineered virus and ensured that the apes became systematically wiser. The magisterial beginning shows Caesar in close-up and from there it's a run-up to an amazing first 20 minutes in which no human is seen and we witness the ins and outs of the apes commune, who communicate by use of a kind of sign language. They have retreated into a mountainous forest near San Francisco, where they have formed a primitive society with Caesar as the absolute leader. They lead a peaceful existence, not aware of the fact that humanity has survived the pandemic. Until such underdeveloped biped turns up one day and immediately shoots an ape at first sight. And that's the beginning of a very interesting struggle for power between two different cultures with survival instinct, self-preservation and demarcating the territory as a central issue. Eventually you start to wonder who really are the primates.Is it necessary to see this movie in less than no time because of the original story with surprising twists? Nope, not at all. It's not really that exciting and even a normal chimpanzee can predict the outcome. But, it's the amazing design of the apes and the sometimes real human actions and emotional traits that they show. Probably the fact that the actors are ""motion captured"" has something to do with it, but it's still breathtaking to watch. At certain moments the CGI wasn't quite correct. Especially the fragments of the horse riding apes. You can notice sometimes that these were computer animations. But that's really nitpicking. The Most part looked lifelike and one can only conclude that the authentic episodes of ""Planet of the Apes"" from the 60's were irrefutable populated by costumed actors.The final confrontation between humans and apes, with Caesar, again played by Andy Serkis (who formerly also performed as Gollum in TLotR), and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) as the two righteous leaders of the two parties, is of course inevitable. Clearly a socio-political theme was ingeniously woven throughout the cheap, ordinary Hollywood entertainment. The mutual distrust with revenge as the cause for the sneaky tricks and treachery. One group is angry because the apes are supposedly the origin of the extermination of mankind. The other group is unnerved by the years of abuse in laboratories and a doomed life in captivity. The result, of course is a clash with also some internal feuds and conflicts.Unfortunately after several memorable and downright masterful film clips, we're treated with some ordinary, cheap action movie scenes. A kind of ""Expendables meets The A-Team"" with heroically swinging of automatic rifles, rockets whizzing around the ears as if the third world war just began and even a tank broke loose. Next to that a big can of sentimentality is pulled open quickly leading to an engaging conversation between Caesar and his son. And then the curtain falls across this magnificent epos with a picture of a real Messiah who parades among his followers. An open end that yearns for an overwhelming third part. But beyond this kitschy final offensive you can admire a few cinematic gems like the appearing of the apes colony in the big city, where they speak to the crowd in an admonishing tone. You could feel the consternation of the crowd after hearing the first words of Caesar. And also the magnificent mimicry Koba used at one time to deceive two armed men. A moment where CGI and facial expressions blend effortlessly. Yes, that's the reason why you should watch this movie.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

84,adamjohns-42575,"""Heh-Hey We're The Monkeys!""",8,16 May 2021,"I have to say that I was genuinely surprised to find out that this film was not rated 15. Although I knew that Caesar was an Ape of peace from the previous film, it was hard to feel at ease in the first few minutes, as the hoards of various Simian beings all gather with some very aggressive stances and even their general appearance. To say that I found it a little bit terrifying would not be a lie and in the current climate of COVID-19, it bears striking similarities with regards to the human population and the situation that they had faced resulting from the effects of 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes'.Getting over my cowardly feelings, I kept going because I knew that I would still enjoy the story. Its easy to recognise things from many other films and TV series that I have seen, none of which I can remember right now obviously, but let's just say that it's not an original concept. That isn't really relevant though as it is done very well and at least in a different scenario (I've never seen it done with Apes before).Nobody stands out specifically for their excellent performance, but there are no bad ones either, making it easy to watch.There is a huge irony to the whole ""Monkey See, Monkey Do"" idea and the attempt to be better than humans, but just ending up exactly the same if not worse. There are also a lot of issues regarding education, discrimination and prejudice that are handled well and could also reflect on life on planet Earth as it currently stands.It will be interesting to see the third instalment and find out how they get from California to New York and how Lady Liberty comes to be up to her neck in it? As well as how it all ends, before Charlton or Marky Mark turn up, dependant on your preference. If it is made as well as this film and 'Rise' it will be good.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

While the adults seem to be in the minority of things. Trying to live and survive. But a family of three, lead by Jason Clarke wants to sympathize with the Apes. He and his family along with others, try to befriend them.Gary Oldman, would not say he is a bad guy but one that is grieving the loss of his family in the movie. In a sense, feels he needs to protect the people from the apes. As they are living and trying to find food and shelter.But really it is a good movie. And shows that a reluctant but surely alliance with time with trust builds. As it does take time between the humans and the apes.

87,davidmvining,Expanding and deepening a series perfectly,10,8 September 2020,"Matt Reeves took the foundation laid in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and he just flat out ran with it, making one of the best looking, most emotionally involving and satisfying, and all around best built film of the franchise. Everything about this film's story deepens and broadens the world and the characters, the visuals back it up intelligently, and the performances even from the secondary rank of characters are all top-notch. This movie is great.In the very first two Planet of the Apes movies there was an overt pessimism and borderline nihilism when it came to humanity and how its current state was going to destroy the future. The franchise largely and intentionally forgot about that, and that always kind of bugged me. And yet, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes actually flies in the face of that thematic base, not presenting humanity as unworthy of its place on top of the world order, but instead it changes the dynamic into a question about the nature of evil and how it can pop up anywhere. Humanity isn't preternaturally evil, and neither are the apes, but it's the presence of evil in both of them that causes the conflict that breaks out.About ten years after the events of the previous film, humanity is a shell of its former self, and Caesar, the talking ape, has moved his tribe into the forests to the north of San Francisco where they are building the beginnings of a new society. They hunt, they sign their thoughts to each other, and they teach their young to read and write in the English language. Their idyllic life gets challenged when, for the first time in two years, humans encroach on their territory. In several ways, the clash of civilizations story that plays out in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes reminds me of Terrence Malick's The New World. Set in a more natural state with an Eden-like idealized society free from outside influence, it's the mere touch and knowledge of the further world that ends up toppling the current order. Things build until neither society can accept the new order fully, and the clash erupts.Well, the humans are moving northward because they are running out of fuel in their sanctuary in the heart of San Francisco. They need to find the hydroelectric dam that fed the northern parts of the state of California, get it back up and running, and redirect the power south. Caesar is smart enough to realize that if he cuts off the humans completely, they're desperate enough to simply come back in force and take what they need, so in order to save the lives of his apes, he allows the work with tight oversight. This does not sit well with Koba, a bonobo who was most cruelly treated by humanity in his previous life as a test subject in scientific labs. The peace that manages to work out between the small group of humans, led by Jason Clarke's Malcolm, and the ape society moves in fits and starts and feels like it could be the cornerstone of something new and good. However, prejudice on both sides keeps it from fully forming. Carver, another human, blames the apes for the disease that wiped out humanity, and his actions of mistrust end up taking the most innocent moments and defiling them.Everything goes wrong, though, when Koba, feeling untrusted by Caesar who seems to love humans more than apes, goes to San Francisco and finds the human's Plan B in the form of weapons testing. There was left a large cache of weapons behind by FEMA, and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman in a small but surprisingly touching role) is having them tested to ensure their usability if Malcolm's mission fails and they need to move in in force. Koba, in a fantastic scene, uses his past as an ape among humans to disarm the two guys testing the weapons and kill them, takes the weapon back, shoots Caesar at the height of the peace between human and ape, and leaves the gun as evidence that humans did the deed.Structurally, it's interesting that the movie is essentially action free until about an hour and a half into the film. There are moments of tension (great tension, by the way) and a very early hunting scene, but outside of that, it's just straight drama. That dramatic work ends up benefiting the movie greatly for when the action does break out and it embraces some visuals that could have felt really schlocky but end up feeling genuine and terrifying. Koba leads the apes in a charge to the tower where the humans have set up their sanctuary, and the apes use horses and the weapons cache to fire upon the tower. I mean, it's images of apes riding horses firing machine guns (sometimes two at a time) in front of walls of fire. You put that at the beginning of a movie or in a story that doesn't have the dramatic support, and it's a cool image but that's it. Because Koba has been so well built and the situation between ape and human so well established, it's an emotional moment of terror as the conflict we knew was possible and never wanted breaks out in full force, demonstrating visually the hatred that had been brewing in Koba the whole film.The resolution of the film is really emotionally satisfying as well. Caesar, spending some days to recover at the hands of Malcolm and his doctor girlfriend Ellie, revisits the home that he and Will shared in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, helping remind him of the gentleness of humanity in the face of the betrayal of his own kind. Recovered enough, Caesar takes some loyal apes into the compound for a faceoff with Koba, and, at the same time, Malcolm has to faceoff against Dreyfus in a similar conflict. The two play really well off of each other because Caesar's becomes a fight on the tallest parts of the tower with Koba, full of dynamic action, while Malcolm's faceoff with Dreyfus is a lowkey affair where Malcolm simply tries to keep Dreyfus from pressing a button. Cutting from one to the other feeds the overall tension, but we don't get overwhelmed by the action playing out. It's an exceptionally well-built final action sequence that way.This is the only movie in the franchise other than Conquest of the Planet of the Apes that really trusts the apes to carry the film. That's not to say that the human characters aren't present, they are, but they rather explicitly act as support to Caesar's story. At the same time, the human side of things are surprisingly touching. It's not that they have their own movies going on at the same time, but Reeves and his writers created enough depth to each of the humans so that they felt real, driven by their own wants and needs, and not just because the plot demanded their subservience. It really is Caesar and Koba, though, who are the stars, representing a conflicting vision of the future that they ultimately cannot bridge. The supporting apes from Maurice, the orangutan, and Blue Eyes, Caesar's eldest son, are as emotionally complex and satisfying as the human supporting characters.The movie looks fantastic with fantastic visual effects from WETA Digital making the apes convincing pretty much every moment they're on screen. The music is really good, even going so far as to evoke the atonal score that Jerry Goldsmith wrote for the original Planet of the Apes. Performances are great throughout, and it's all so very well written. This is an outright great film and proof that Matt Reeves is one of the best big-budget directors working.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
88,Seraphion,Great story about trust and distrust,7,22 July 2014,"Continuing from 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes, now after ten years of the simian flu virus spread and killed off nine in ten humans, the apes group led by Caesar has nested in the woods near the ruins of San Fransisco while some remaining humans are surviving in the city. Seeking to reach a broken dam for electricity in the apes' grounds, the humans send a group led by Malcolm. They meet the apes with a wrong start. Caesar give the humans a chance at repairing the dam. Koba, one of Caesar's lieutenant, goes to the city and discovers the humans' weapons pile up. He then finds Caesar deciding to let the humans stay to help his sick wife and contested it, resulting in Caesar attacking him. Koba goes back to the city and gets a rifle. The humans finished repairing the dam and power goes back in the city. With the rifle, Koba shoots Caesar at night and framed it on the humans. Thus that night the male apes attack the city and overrun it. In the morning, Malcolm and his family found Caesar dying and took care of him. While getting supplies to handle Caesar in the city Malcom comes across Blue Eyes, Caesar's oldest son, and brings him to Caesar. Blue Eyes then frees the apes loyal to Caesar and they all regroup on Caesar. Caesar faces Koba on a tower, but the humans blow up the tower's base, killing many apes and leaving Koba hanging for his life. Koba asks Caesar for help, reminding him the principle that no ape may kill other ape. But Caesar lets him fall after stating that Koba is no ape. Malcolm then tell Caesar to flee as the humans have contacted the military which will come to war on the apes. Caesar says that the apes had already started a war, and he and Malcolm parted ways.The story is very nice, weaving the focus back and forth between Caesar's and Malcolm's group. I like how the movie starts without any human dialog, focusing only on the apes and stayed like that for some duration and then jumps quickly to the humans without losing any story relevance. At the end, it shows that the humans and the apes are not so very different in the end, they both have differences of arguments and betrayals within their own. The story twists are nice, even though they are very predictable. But the direction and execution on how the movie portrays intelligent apes is nice to watch.The acting is a great work. Andy Serkis and the other cast who play as the apes did a great job in doing the sign languages and the body movements. On the other hand, the relatively newer faces of the human cast can also present us a great set of emotion play. Jason Clarke particularly has gone a long way since acting stiffly as a guard in Death Race (2008).The other thing that is great is the sets, costumes, makeup and visual effects done for this movie. Of course the costumes look very realistic, as well as the makeup, that looks like it took a long time to apply. The visual effects are worthy of praise also because they can handle the resizing of the limb body parts of the cast to suit the real simian anatomy. It's very nice to see the high effort put into it. The sets are also magnificent. The ruined city and the Golden Gate bridge are depicted very nicely with all their remnants that still indicate its former glory.My final say for this movie is a solid 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation to go and see it is another sure thing I give you, although I know that most of you may have already seen it. But this movie is worth seeing again for me. It's a nice entertaining piece of work.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
89,rgkarim,Incredible Sequel with All The Right Qualities,9,12 July 2014,"It's about the middle of July and usually about this time we get a blockbuster to save us from the bland, and often carbon copy, comedies that fill the theaters. While normally the movie of choice is some big superhero movie like the Dark Knight or Spiderman, this summer lacks justice driven superheroes running around in tights. Instead the middle of July feature has some harrier characters dishing out justice, ones who were inspired years ago when science fiction wasn't all about special effects. I'm talking about Planet of the Apes, and today I review the latest installment in the series by director Matt Reeves. So let's get cracking on this sequel shall we?Three years ago we learned the origins of how the apes began their journey into dominance over the planet Earth, the ending leaving a cliffhanger that opened up a wide array of possibilities for the sequel to follow. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up ten years after the ending of the first film in a world where humans are on the brink of extinction and apes are the fittest for survival. From the very beginning Dawn opens up with a dark and somber mood, the mere opening hunt a precipice for the intensity that is to follow. Within minutes we are introduced into setting, and immersed into the drama at hand, foregoing drawn out explanations and tired dialog intense scenes and getting right to the situation at hand. Through the use of imaginative design, cinematography magic, and some simple, though effective, dialog the story pans out and keeps the plot going. Over the course of the entire movie, the savage wilderness the world has become keeps one on their toes, wondering what event will offset the perilous balance the world is currently in. While most of it is predictable, from some very obvious character designs, I was engrossed in the movie, happy to see Reeves pushing my suspicions to the limit and keeping my adrenaline pumping with action that fit the timing and lasted an appropriate amount of time. These heated moments would then disperse and often open up characters to conveniently timed interventions that allowed for more details to enfold. For this reviewer, this is the art of storytelling, building components such as action and CGI around a story instead of the other way around. Speaking of CGI, let's talk about the special effects of this movie. Once again the design team has created beautiful effects in the tarnished planet of Earth. The chimps in particular are gorgeous in design, with hair, skin, and scars mixed together to give the main apes differentiating qualities to help tell them apart. Their movement is fluid, the apes lumbering, swinging, and acting in a manner equivalent to their real life counterparts adding more to the realism at hand. Andy Serkis' talents continued to impress me in this film, as he brought the humanity to Caesar in many forms from facial expressions to the awkward hybrid gait he sports. Of course what impressed me the most were the battle scenes, where the fast pace, and explosive action are true tests to the animation at hand. Dawn passes with flying colors, the animation remaining fluid, as the camera captures the hectic warzone between man and ape. Best of all you actually get to see the action, as opposed to other movies where the camera can't seem to stand still long enough to see anything. Though not only are the monkeys well designed, but also the world itself is incredible from the decaying metropolis that was once San Francisco, to the secluded fortress of the monkeys. I felt the world before me could exist, impressed with the creative integration of nature and architecture mish mashed together in ways I would never had thought about doing. Yet the biggest thing the visuals and acting did for me, was stir up a wide array of emotions. Dawn of the Apes is filled to the brim with intense moments that bring out a wide variety of responses over the course of two hours. Caesar himself opens up many of these doors, his facial reactions in particular reflecting his soul, while also being portrayed as the hero from well angled shots. Even the other monkeys will get you worked up as they try to adapt to the changes in their world, only to be treated like scum in a manner that similar to racism. Yet, a few rogue monkeys also reveal the darker and inhumane, or should I say inAPane, manner that makes them no better than the humans they so despise. Of course the biggest thing that affected me was seeing the death of the apes, their high-pitched screams of terror penetrating my core. As for the humans, they too have some moments that are emotionally moving, but they paled in comparison to the CGI simians. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, and Gary Oldman did a fine job acting, but they took a back seat for a good portion of the film, the exception being Clarke, merely providing a little story and situation relief when needed. My words can do very little to justify how much I enjoyed this movie. The dynamic character that is Caesar continues to evolve, bringing so many people into the world and creating a story worthy of introducing us back into the nostalgic world. With great action and suspense, incredible visuals, and a wide array of emotions, this may be one of the best sequels I have ever seen. Therefore I strongly encourage everyone to head to the theater to see this film, as it is also one of the best for the summer. I look forward to the next movie in this series, and hope Reeves will take lead again. My scores for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes are:Action/Drama/Sci-Fi: 9.0 Movie Overall: 9.0",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
90,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,6,13 July 2014,"There seemed to be a lot of audience participation going on during a screening I attended for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. One guy sat near the front and laughed at scenes that were not supposed to be funny. Another guy sitting near me, actually fell asleep for twenty minutes and preceded to snore loudly. Then there was someone who sat in the back and uttered things that made no sense throughout the film's most pivotal scenes. Myself, well I kept looking at my phone (I don't wear a watch so I kept checking the time) because a majority of ""Dawn's"" running time plodded along while recycling the same screenplay (which contains themes of authority, status, and governorship) over and over again.Listen, even after eight movies in the Planet of the Apes franchise have ventured into theaters, humans and hunched over, furry creatures still just can't seem to get along. Oh and I almost forgot, their own kind for some reason, can't see eye to eye either. In this 2014 release containing a large dose of bland, straightforward storytelling undercut with battle scenes borrowed from Saving Private Ryan, the apes grovel and fight with each other till no end (the violence is of the gore-free, PG-13 variety but it still stings).Containing at times, one of the most annoying musical scores in many a moon, featured as a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes with almost none of that film's returning cast members, and harboring sequences that show gun-toting apes riding wild horses (giddyup!), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes reverts to scenes depicting the aftermath of ten years later. In San Francisco, a virus called ALZ-113 infected humans causing their way of life to almost come to an end. In present day, apes are on one side of said city and said (leftover) humans are on the other. The two sides, trying to refrain from starting an all out war, somehow meet to power up a hydroelectric dam set to better San Fran's power generation abilities. The humans, who live in a sort of dystopian future, form a group of leaders led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who believes in saving the human race while forgetting the apes, and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who wants only peace and overall equality from the two sides. Now ""Dawn"" with its lush, dark direction by Mark Reeves (he shot 2008's Cloverfield) and its strong cast, still left me feeling uninterested. It's obviously well made but at times, lacks any adage of genuine thrills, suspense, or perilousness. Also, I miss the old movies in this franchise where the apes almost looked human and spoke perfect English. ""Dawn'"" and the previously released Rise of the Planet of the Apes (from 2011), feature apes that well, look almost exactly like apes. They communicate mostly with sign language and speak minimal dialogue (an example would be one of them spouting the line, ""Apes! Together, strong!). And now as a result, the novelty attached to what's on screen in general, is wearing thin with me. The old ones were tongue and cheek with a smidgen of dark humor. The new ones come off as a little boring and almost too serious.The acting is decent enough even though some of the characters fade in and out of the proceedings. Gary Oldman's Dreyfus is a variation and it piggybacks on his RoboCop performance from February. Nobody wines and winces with his line readings quite like Gary Oldman. Then we have Keri Russell giving a deep, subtle performance as nurse Ellie, a strong woman who grieves the loss of her child from the previous epidemic. Her role is somewhat undeveloped but it's surely no fault of her own. Head ape Caesar is played by Andy Serkis and he's just fine donning the costume and nailing the operatic mannerisms. That leaves Mr. Jason Clarke outgunning everybody with an amazing screen presence and courtliness as a sympathetic figure in Malcolm. He was brooding and intense in 2012's Zero Dark Thirty and he sure does shine here as well.In conclusion, a mixed review is as much praise as I can give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. I liked the creative opening title sequence, the opening zoom out shot, and the first set of minutes that felt like they came out of the silent film era. But as successful and long running as these films are, I find myself watching the same one over and over again. Evolution says that we came from apes (Darwin to be exact). You'd think that our species and their species could I don't know, at least try to cohabitate. Some much for that. As expected, ""Dawn"" leaves the door open yet again for an inevitable sequel (or prequel or whatever). I have a couple of suggestions for working titles: Growing Tired of the Planet of the Apes and Have Had Quite Enough of the Planet of the Apes. Slammer!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
91,rannynm,An Exciting and Thrilling Blockbuster,10,9 July 2014,"What an exciting and thrilling blockbuster! I was worried about this film. This was the 8th add on to the Planet of the Apes series, second to the reboots. So this Is a sequel and an eighth movie. I expected that it would feel a bit stretching, but it isn't. In fact, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' main purpose Is to show another side of these super apes and to set up the story for the next film in the franchise. This isn't just about fighting; in fact, fighting scenes, even though they are epic, take very little part of the film. There is romance within humans and apes families, sometimes, the apes can act funny. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time! Also it has a story line no one expects! The original Planet of the Apes book is about humans that went to a planet ruled by apes. When they come back to Earth, the same thing happened to our planet. The reboots, (Dawn of The Planet of The Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are pretty much prequels. So, Caesar leaves civilization with his ape friends while the human race almost goes extinct due to a deadly virus. The remaining humans struggle for power. Will they be able to find a new source of power or will it be up to the apes and their leader to decide the humans' fate? For me, this is a fantastic addition to the series. They don't try too hard to make it too action-packed and cool looking. The apes look extremely realistic and I really like that. They include some scenes from Rise of the Planet of the Apes which helps to pull it all together nicely. The action and fighting even has some stuff from the original 1963 Planet of the Apes book! The director made it a perfect length and, in fact, this is the first time I've seen what I would call a ""trailer"" movie (a movie that looks like an hour-long trailer for the next one in the series) that is entertaining and includes a surprise ending. My favorite scene is when we see a small group of humans working on the power station. When they wake up, the youngest is sitting with an ape that acts as a teacher to young apes and is very loyal to Caesar. The kid gives him a book and reads along with him. It shows how well they actually understand each other and how alike humans and apes are. It shows friendship and how two creatures of different species can be friends. This film has some violence and intensity so I recommend it for ages 11 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic graphics, a well planned story, excellent cinematography and stupendous acting. Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

92,Kingslaay,"Creative, interesting and entertaining",7,29 July 2017,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes exceeds expectations as it is an engaging and well executed film. The CGI is easily the strongest and best aspect of the film, it adds a great degree of realism to the film and we feel we really are seeing a conflict between man and ape. We see sophisticated apes who are capable of building a world or ecosystem of their own and having their own society. It also showed how the apes and humans were not so different and both were capable of deception. It had elements of Shakespearean plays with its emphasis on power, deception and ascending towards it. The film was easy to understand and entertaining to its end. It also nicely left the door open to a sequel. 7.5/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
93,Matt_Layden,Dawn is an intelligent spectacular Hollywood blockbuster.,9,11 July 2014,"When Rise of the Planet of the Apes was first released, I found myself laughing at the trailers. I thought it was going to be terrible. Boy was I wrong, it turned out to be an engaging thrilling spectacle. I don't know why I seem to keep underestimating this series because I didn't expect this sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to be that great. Not only is the film great, it's probably the best summer blockbuster this year and will no doubt make my top ten list by the year's end. The virus at the end of the original film has almost wiped out humanity. There are small groups of survivors who are genetically immune to the virus. One of these survivors is Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who is on a mission to find an alternative power source since his group of survivors, including Gary Oldman and Keri Russell, are running out of their resources. While out in the forest, he runs into the apes, ruled by Caesar (Andy Serkis). Despite an uneasy truce between man and ape, tension boils and war becomes inevitable. I know people were trying to rally for an Oscar nomination for Serkis and his portrayal of Caesar. That fell on deaf ears. This time around, expect them to make even louder noise. Serkis delivers his best performance in motion capture to date and gives us a deep and inspirational character here. Caesar is a born leader; he commands the screen just as much as he commands his apes. Stop with this nonsense of what is his performance and what the do the animators manipulate. Look at what is brought to the table; we have a compelling character that we care for. I found myself on the edge of my seat with excitement whenever Caesar was on the screen and his second in command Koba is right there with him. Scarred from numerous testing by humans, Koba is a classic tragic character. You know that he doesn't trust the humans; his experience with them is the complete opposite of Caesar's. You know where he is coming from and you know where he is heading. His actions are justified in his eyes and you never outright hate him. This is what great writing, performance, direction and stellar animation is here. We have two unforgettable characters at odds with each other, even though they both respect and love one another. If you were impressed with the motion capture animation of the first film, marvel at what they've accomplished here. You'll rub your eyes a few times thinking these apes were real. The attention to detail is astonishing and should rightly be awarded come Oscar time. A film like Transformers adds nothing new, special or awe-inspiring in terms of its effects. Sure it looks cool, but this film makes the special effects integral to the emotional core of the story. The facial expressions on these apes make you feel more emotion than what many actors try to achieve their whole career. Reeve's stages exciting action sequences in the third act, when both the humans and apes collide. The special effects stay first class. You never lose sight of where you are in the action. Reeves constantly makes sure that we as the audience, are aware of the action in correspondence to the characters. It's refreshing to be able to see what's going on up on that screen. All building up to the emotional climax. This film simply has it all. It runs a long 130 minutes and it feels a tad long due to some pacing issues, but a lot of those scenes are to flesh out the characters. Both apes and humans are given their time and no one really gets the short stick. We spend most of our time with the apes, but we never are told to side against the humans. There are individuals on both sides that make stupid decisions. The film's one clichéd hiccup is that it uses a one-dimensional character that has been written a thousand times before in these films to initiate the tension. I can handle one hotheaded trigger-happy one-dimensional character in this piece because we are given deep and interesting characters to actually care about. Dawn is an intelligent spectacular Hollywood blockbuster in a time when there are thousands of mindless boring flicks that companies just throw money at. This is proof, right here, that with patience, care and talent you can have an engaging thrilling film that people will want to see and talk about. Stop with the product placement, high priced trash that gets spit out of the ass end of Hollywood. We need more films like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
94,pc95,Too Melodramatic at Times,6,22 August 2014,"Directed fairly well by Matt Reeves, I thought this 2nd installment of the newer Apes series, was a bit too long and melodramatic, not as good as its predecessor, but not a dud either. What especially annoyed me was the over-cooked music straining to make you feel grand importance or aching to involve you. That detracted for me and was heavy-handed; Reeves failed to catch it. The CGI was good in some parts and terrible in others - the worst scene being the opener in the forest, where the misplaced shimmering looked amateurish and poor with apes and animals. After that, rendering improved more. Much of the background matte art/stills looked competent, as did the apes who looked much better in San Francisco/city scapes where light sources were easier to render. On the poor melodrama, I think subtitles for the sign language looked silly and ultimately probably should've been left off, although realize without them, much information is lost. Of the actors, Jason Clarke was great, while the others mediocre to poor. The story is fairly good though the plot is not really original.

The rest were just family-values people trying to be good. The lead actor was dull, and why was Oldman cast as a military commander with his squeaky voice - it actually broke like a teenager's when he was giving commands.So much of it was predictable, and you just knew it was going to end with a punch up.

Just watched this for a second time, but it seems to be a different edit, much longer, with less of Oldman. Much better movie - 8/10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
97,brando647,DAWN Surpasses RISE; I'm Excited to See Where it Goes from Here,9,24 July 2015,"DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES continues to prove this franchise as one of the most entertaining reboots to come out of Hollywood in an age where refurbishing classic favorites is the new fad. I was such a fan of the first in this new series (RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) that I actually went to the theaters this time around for the new installment. And it continues to blow my mind in how good these new films are. If you were a fan of the first film, you will most likely find plenty to love in this one. It continues the tale of our species' downfall and the inevitable rise of apes to a position of dominance. It begins around ten years after the end of RISE. The ""simian flu"" epidemic that closed the previous film has eliminated all but a small percentage of the human race, and we're introduced to one survivor camp in San Francisco where their continued existence relies on jump-starting a local dam to restore power. Unfortunately, their journey to the dam leads them into the territory of the apes. The apes, led by Caesar (Andy Serkis, returning), have created their own little utopia, evolving into a functional society, and they are rightfully unwilling to trust the seemingly violent humans at first. Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the man in charge of the human expedition, stands in awe of the apes and what they've become, and he believes a truce can be reached that will allow peaceful coexistence and access to the dam. But there are forces working from both sides that won't allow that to happen.I really love this movie. I'm ecstatic that, despite the potential for the usual big budget explosions and battle sequences, DAWN continues to play on a smaller, more personal scale. Yes, we get some awesome action sequences in the second half of the movie but the first half of the movie, where Malcolm and his team are brought into ape society and we see their early interactions, is the best part. Director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD) and the screenwriters weren't interested in making another generic summer film but telling an engaging story that makes sense in the progression of the franchise. The apes are not yet the reigning species on the planet, but they're getting there. The humans are still around in scattered packets and neither side trusts the other. The apes, particularly Koba (an ape from the first film that experienced the worst of human nature in laboratory experimentation), have lingering mistrust for the proved violent nature of humans; meanwhile, the humans are generally petrified at the concept of an ape that can speak and reason. They're animalswe don't negotiate with ""lesser"" species. The movie plays as a morality tale about xenophobia and our nature to fear things that are different from us, but it tackles it from two angles, showing that the humans aren't the only ones capable of irrational fear and snap judgments of others.Andy Serkis is an experienced motion capture actor but I really think DAWN is the ultimate example as to how talented the man is. Caesar is his best character yet. The technology has advanced to a point where Caesar is so convincing that I was never once pulled out of the movie at the sight of him. Immersed in the film, I never doubted that I was watching a ""living, breathing, thinking"" ape. And his actual performance was fantastic, imbuing the character with emotion and earning the audience's sympathy. Really, all of the apes were done to perfection. Maurice the orangutan (Karin Konoval) never utters a word and yet is still a well-built, three-dimensional character. It was a bold move for Reeves to utilize characters in a major action film that rely for large parts of the film on non-verbal communication in a world where the thought of subtitles will scare off segments of the target audience. But Reeves created a summer movie that aims to be more than the average, striving to tell an interesting story populated with strong characters that just so happens to include talking apes who can ride horses and (poorly) use firearms. I really enjoy this movie and I'm excited to see how well the series has done so far, and I hope they manage to keep the same momentum in the inevitable continuation. The film ends at a key moment in human/ape relations and telegraphs what the next installment will entail. As long as the franchise is handled with the same care and consideration (and especially if Reeves continues on as director), I imagine these movies will be some of the most anticipated (for myself, anyway) movies in the years to come.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
98,mhorg2018,A Brilliant Continuation of the Re-Thinking,10,13 July 2014,"I have been an apes fan since I was a child. The first Apes I saw in the movies was Escape, then a few years later I sat through all Five (the Go Ape! Festival). Dawn is a brilliant film. There are no true villains (which is much like the original. The Apes weren't evil, they were afraid of Taylor). This shows how two civilizations, one rising and one failing clash. The story is tight, the film itself is beautiful. I recommend this to any movie fan. This is similar in tone, to me to Nolan's The Dark Knight. If you took Batman out of it, replaced him with a vigilante, it would still be a great film. It's the same here. The Academy will have to come up with an additional award for actors like Andy Serkis. His Cesar is brilliant. Just a tremendous film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
99,bob-rutzel-1,Unvelievably Good and Seamless,7,1 January 2015,"The surviving Humans (from an animal virus) want to restart the generators for the city. The Apes say okay and the only condition is that no guns be allowed. All agree. Yes, Apes talk. Now you know this isn't going to work, right? Each side has its own hothead who wants nothing to do with this. Let the games begin. I don't know if there were real acting Apes in this, or there were CGI Apes, or Humans made up to look like Apes. This was unbelievably good and everything regarding the Apes was seamless. Hard to believe, I know. Okay, Andy Serkis was Caesar the Top Ape so we know he was dressed as an Ape. There were others, too, dressed that way. The story is a simple one as you may have already figured out. It's the cinematography, photography and CGI that win in here and hold you. Like I said it's all seamless. The CGI is unbelievable. You will believe. And, you may find yourself caring for the Apes.When you see the Apes fighting and swinging among trees you may ask yourself: are they real? These scenes are that good. Nice to see Jason Clark, who did a good job playing Malcom, finally getting a movie shot as he had been in some TV police dramas that didn't run too long and that was sad as those shows were very good as was he.Gary Oldman and Keri Russell were good in supporting roles as were the rest of the cast. We last saw Andy Serkis as Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He played Caesar in that movie and again in this one. He plays Caesar to perfection. The over-riding slogan in this and all Planet Ape movies is: Ape does not kill Ape. Too bad Humans have learned nothing from the Ape movies. Because you may have seen The Planet of the Apes back in the day, you may suspect who is going to win in this one. There may be another Planet Ape movie before we get to see the remake of Planet of the Apes. I am sure there will be a remake. Will check to see if Vegas has book on it. Over all this is very good, seamless as mentioned and the pacing is spot on. You won't be bored. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

100,quincytheodore,"Although the plot is predictable, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes combines great visual effect and refined motion-capture acting into an emotional spectacle",7,11 July 2014,"Much of the novel factor of Planet of the Ape franchise is how believably humane the apes can be, it's also a measure bar as comparing the movies of this franchise in order serves as prove of technology advancement. Andy Serkis has perfected a masterful interpretation of the ape-human mime hybrid. It's not an overstatement that the apes fare better and more convincing than the human counterpart.Visual is splendid and aesthetically pleasing. It's not as extravagant as other blockbusters in recent time, but the art direction offers a unique appeal. Different than most grayish dire post-apocalypse setting, the movie turns to a more organic setting, a lustful return-to-nature background while some of civilization remains still stand tattered. Glossy urban areas have now coated with rustic flavor while the apes territory is leaning towards early civilization settlement. One is deteriorating while the other contrastingly and gradually improves.The movie has one of the best uses of motion capture lately. Apes moves with fluid almost humanized motion even though some of the hunchback traits still persist. It's interesting to see such varied range of emotion that can be conveyed by the apes' while most of them only communicate with body language. Action sequences are well done; a couple of scenes are shot in very interesting point of view or continuous shot. It's a little heavier on action than the prequel.However, the humans aren't nearly as intriguing. Jason Clarke as Malcolm, the engineer and leader figure does a decent job, but he's eclipsed by Andy Serkis' Caesar. He's not really an engaging lead role as James Franco was, and it's a bit underwhelming when the movie tries to compare the two together. Gary Oldman as Dreyfus works with what he has. Being a man with practically a thousand faces, he can pull off any role, but here his character is rather unexceptional.The plot is a bit overused though; those who have seen Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas or Avatar will find little surprise. Granted, there's only so much this ""two civilizations"" premise could go and the movie does go for more mature outlook, but a lot of the scenes foreshadow any twist the movie could've had, even more so for those knowledgeable of the franchise. In the end Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does any movie strive to, it immerses the audience and makes them invest in the character's struggle. With the pace it's going the apes are here to stay.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
101,Sergeant_Tibbs,Bland in every facet.,6,13 November 2014,"I kinda liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It was very clumsy, but entertaining in patches. I'm quite a fan of the 1968 original, but I have no idea why it keeps getting sequels and reboots. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the enduring acclaimed blockbusters of this Summer but I struggled to see why it's necessary. What is it bridging in this franchise? It didn't really answer the question. It's the bleak followup to a relatively bright film in hindsight, depicting a very obvious war that needn't be shown, especially if it wants to say it's due to one irresponsible character. The film is just far too simplistic and on the nose to resonate. It's passable and not necessarily stupid, but it induces eye rolls for being inexplicably bland. Neither the human characters or apes are interesting or essential, as rousing as a Gary Oldman speech can be. It's a shame coming from the director of Cloverfield that it's so visually compromised, though the dark grade is nice enough. Sure, the visual effects are good, but the film takes no risks and it just did nothing for me. I won't be around for whatever the third is going to claim to be.6/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

103,Troy_Campbell,"Enthralling, clever, mature and breathtaking.",10,11 July 2014,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a phenomenal motion picture that I thought couldn't be matched by it's inevitable sequel. I was wrong. Set 10 years after the events of Rise, this follow up sees humankind dwindled down to a small collection of survivors of the Simian Flu, whilst the scientifically enhanced apes are slowly but surely evolving into the superior species. Matt Reeves (Let Me Go) takes over from Rupert Wyatt behind the camera and brings a seamless continuation of astounding visual style and highly intelligent narrative drive. It's easy to highlight the awe-inspiring CGI simians – and the human motion-captured performances behind them – as a standout, because quite frankly, their creation is one of modern cinema's greatest visual achievements along with the Na'vi (Avatar) and all of Gravity. In particular, the ape leader Caeser is a tour de force; Andy Serkis' unparalleled mo-cap work and the flawless, meticulously detailed computer effects that bring him to life combine to craft a mesmerizing and memorable protagonist that sits in the highest echelon of filmic characters, period. Yet while the action sequences are outstanding and the CGI is immaculate, it's the Oscar worthy screenplay that makes Dawn a blockbusting masterpiece. Unafraid to venture into mature, emotional territory, the filmmakers give the plot room to breathe and – as a rarity in mainstream movies – the story propels the action and not the other way around. Additionally, the major players – humans and apes alike – are imbued with multi-layered character arcs and richly textured personalities, allowing the likes of Serkis, Toby Kebbell (Casear's vengeful right hand man Koba), Jason Clarke (the human ""hero""), Keri Russell (Clarke's doctor love interest) and Gary Oldman (the battle weary human leader) to create affecting and captivating personas.

105,brchthethird,Apes. With Guns. On Horseback.,8,13 December 2014,"Not having seen any of the original 'Apes' films (even the Tim Burton remake), I really liked RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES because of its emotionally resonant story and awesome special effects. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES continues in the same vein, while covering different thematic territory. No new ground is broken, per se, but the manner in which it is presented and the talent involved lend it some freshness which would otherwise have been missing from what is already a really good film.DAWN takes place about 10 years after the events of RISE, when the Simian flu has killed off a large portion of the human population. The apes have migrated to the forests and started their own primitive civilization, while the humans hang on to what little they have left in the ruins of the city. With fuel about the run out, they seek to gain access to a power-generating dam, but that dam is located right in the middle of ape territory. Soon, mistrust on both sides leads to a conflict that has far-reaching consequences.One thing I noticed continually while watching this was how far special effects have come. It was only 15 years ago (or so) that we were still using people in ape suits to portray apes, but now since RISE, they are done in motion capture. They already looked really good and photo-realistic in RISE, but here in DAWN they look even better. I think that Andy Serkis did some of his best work ever here, and also the actor who played Koba, Caesar's right hand ""man"" (and later, nemesis). The digital augmentation of the sets and locations was also seamless and created a world you could really believe in.Anyway, moving on to more important aspects. The human cast was all portrayed very well, the standout being Jason Clarke as Malcolm. His character is kind of a human counterpart to Caesar, in that he only wants what is best for his family, and that he is more pragmatic when it comes to certain situations. There's also Gary Oldman as Dreyfus, someone who leans more towards the confrontational side, like Koba. Even though I think his character wasn't given enough development, there was one scene which really sold you on his plight and gave the audience a potent emotional connection to him. Across the board, all of the performances were excellent.Thematically, the film deals with conflict and how we handle it, how it starts, how trust is broken. It's a very basic story, but one that should resonate with viewers of all ages. Also, with the ape culture, there's kind of Animal Farm thing going on where you have two leaders vying for the trust and respect of the people. This is replicated to a degree with the human cast, but the bulk of the movies' themes are handled when the apes are on screen.This leads me to the only thing I can really pick on with the film: that is, while the themes are certainly important, they are handled in an overly broad and unsubtle way. The apes basically act as mouthpieces for the core ideas of the film, and at times you might be tempted to roll your eyes, but then you'll just move on because you're that absorbed in the world being created and emotionally involved with the characters.Overall, I think this represents a significant step up from the previous one, which was already very good to begin with. It's one of the best films to come out in Summer 2014, and I highly recommend that you see it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
106,proud_luddite,Entertaining,7,8 June 2019,"In the distant future, a worldwide virus has killed most of the human race. A community of survivors lives in the ruins of San Francisco while a tribe of very advanced apes with human-like qualities lives nearby in Muir Woods. Tensions and violence erupt between the species.Although this is a science-fiction film and had opportunities for new paradigms, the old chivalry paradigms are still used particularly in the ape community where the men do all the hunting, fighting, and governing while the women stay home and give birth to baby boys. (As an aside, why is it that nearly all on-screen births are boys? If girl children are never seen to be born, then how can there end up being mothers to give birth to baby boys?) On the human side, there is a major female character but, as usual, this number is kept to the usual maximum of one.Besides the misgivings, this is still a finely made film mainly for the special effects and the make-up prosthetics. It is also a good metaphor for current and past wars among humans. Each tribe in the film has a minority of wise people with good hearts who try to find peaceful common ground with like minds on the other side. Sadly, they are attacked for this by members of their own tribe.

107,maurice_yacowar,Current world politics reflected in genetically evolved apes exposure of inhumanity,7,17 July 2014,"The Planet of the Apes franchise is so clearly established that it can be inflected for current issues. Each new version mirrors its time.Matt Reeves's Dawn of the PA makes our first identification with the apes, not the humans. The first episode bares the savagery in nature, as apes hunt down deer and fight off a grizzly. This is nature, red in tooth and claw and redder in 3-D. Still, we also get our first sense of the apes' humanity, in their leader Caesar's sensitivity to his son and his gratitude to the ape who kills the bear. The human father/son story feels undeveloped beside this one.When the humans are introduced they're intruders in that ape world. A thoughtless rifle shot suggests they might be even more murderous than the apes. As the two forces are defined the gap between animal and human narrows. The wise old orangutan (properly named Maurice) can read and teaches the young to read. He also conveys a morality that makes these apes superior to most of these humans: ""Ape does not kill ape."" When the villain ape Koba does, he forces Caesar to one of the two key lines of the film: ""I didn't realize how much like us the humans are."" Caesar's assumption of his species' moral superiority is undermined by his rival's evil.The other key line is Caesar's warning to good human Malcolm: The humans won't forgive the apes for the war Koba started. Caesar forgave Koba his first insurrection, which only encouraged the second. Their world in ruins, Caesar disqualifies Koba — ""You are not ape."" — so he can drop him to his death. But the humans' inability to forgive augurs a continuing cycle of violence, murder and destruction — i.e., on the brighter side, a few sequels; but in real life, the end of civilization as we knew it.Certainly Koba's cunning shows him superior to the drinking arrogant guards he tricks. As the humans note, the apes are not as dependent as the humans upon outside power sources. They're stronger and they have genetically evolved. On both sides there are are good and there are bad characters. But in the post-plague world, in which humanity has shrunk to small bands of isolated survivors, the apes seem to be starting evolution all over again. Win or lose these apes expose the failure of humanity.Those three key lines make the film a clear reflection upon the present human landscape. All over the world, humans are killing humans. That is, they lack these apes' principle. They also deny their kinship to their victims, how alike they are, how trivial their mortal differences. And worse: they don't forgive. Wherever humans are killing humans these days you find inhumanity in action and long-festering differences magnified to justify slaughter. The apes' dawn is our miserable midnight.

They've hired the right directer, the right screenwriters, the right crew, everything needed to make a crowd pleaser that people will still be watching even after the colder months have set in. The movie's finest achievement though is that it shows how real conflict, be it big or small, actually starts and grows as every side, even the ""bad"" guys, have a valid point. I liked how most of the focus is on the apes themselves and that Caesar is crushed between two conflicting minds. And when the action comes it's really well done and carries even more weight owing to that fact that it's actually about something and not just for the sake of filling in gaps between the story.

110,KnightsofNi11,"A bit behind Rise, but the action holds its own",7,19 August 2014,"In 2011 the long dead Planet of the Apes franchise got an unexpectedly successful reboot with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Nobody expected it to kill at the box office like it did, and as a result a whole new franchise was born. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes marks the second, and certainly not the last, film in this franchise and it's a noticeable improvement on the first in some places, and a step backwards in others. Of course, if you're like me and you have a soft spot for dystopian sci- fi, this blockbuster can deliver a solid two hours of entertainment.Dawn picks up a few years after the events of Rise where Caesar and his ape army fled to the Redwoods just before the aptly named Simian flu begins spreading and killing off the human population. Dawn kicks off by introducing us to the post apocalypse where the majority of the human population is dead, and the ape population has grown considerably. The apes now have their own civilization established in the woods; a civilization I was really excited about at the beginning of the film and would have liked to see more of. Instead, those pesky humans come in and interfere with everything, which sparks the central and, after a while, long winded conflict of the film which is humans vs apes. Caesar, because of his upbringing with humans, still wants to trust this race that many of his ape counterparts, specifically Koba, the film's main antagonist, vehemently despise. Unless you're absolutely oblivious you can pretty easily assume that when the humans need help from the apes it kicks off a whirlwind of driving conflict that carries forth an explosively action packed plot. If it's nothing else Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a lot of fun. Like, an absolute blast. Every year I feel like motion capture technology improves exponentially, and 2014 is no exception, with Dawn displaying awe inspiring motion capture performances that blend so seamlessly with the rest of the film. The illusion of movie magic is never broken. The raging human v ape battles are as exciting and as spell binding as they should be. Then, at the same time, the more sentimental and intimate ape moments feel just as real as everything else with an impeccable amount of detail going into each and every ape we see on screen. They certainly feel more authentic than the tiredly straight forward human story. Thanks to astounding technology and fantastic performers, the motion capture performances are honestly better than any of the human performances in the film. Where Dawn suffers is obviously not in its grandeur or its effects, it's the fact that it has traded in layered storytelling for a whole lot of simplicity. Dawn doesn't have a deep seated conflict or textured characters for us to sink our empathetic teeth into. One of the things I really thought Rise did well was the pacing at which it told Caesar's story and detailed his struggle. It felt very authentic and believable as we watched Caesar grow up trying to discover why he was different from all the other apes he was surrounded by. Watching his coping with abandonment and betrayal by his human friends feels so real and my sympathy with Caesar knew no boundaries during Rise. With Dawn we are repeatedly hit over the head with ""Caesar trust humans. Koba no trust humans. Caesar love humans more than apes. Koba love apes more than Caesar. etc, etc, etc."" This dichotomy is laid out within the first 20 to 30 minutes of the film, but we get to be constantly reminded of how it works for the next hour and a half. Dawn doesn't have the storytelling chops of its predecessor, and its script, chock full of unnatural and poorly disguised plot forwarding devices, also leaves something to be desired. But what Dawn does have is the setting, the dystopian post apocalypse world that has been created here is awesome, and the great action set pieces that persist for two hours left testosterone fueled adolescent me very happy. The side of me that appreciates great storytelling was underwhelmed, but not enough to say that I didn't really enjoy Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It was even turned into a stage musical featuring everyone's favourite actor Troy McClure.Then, over 40 years on (Let's ignore the Tim Burton atrocity, for his sake) they decided to start from the beginning again, with Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes (You can always count on these movies for having long titles). This was a very intelligent and moving precursor to future events, with a superb climax on top of the Golden Gate bridge. The ape costumes were amazing too.Now we have the sequel, which is just as thoughtful and heart rending as the 2010 entry, but ups the action ante to 11. There are several fight scenes, between hordes of men and simians, which could grace the final reel of any blockbuster movie ever made. Here though, they only act as a taste of what's to come...The fact that they maintain the perfect balance between pathos and violence throughout is fantastic, and ranks this as one of the most impressive big budget spectaculars I've seen in recent years.

SPOILER ALERT: One complaint I had initially was the manner of Koba's death and how Caesar seems to give in to an elitist attitude that deems an ape (as anthropomorphized human) no longer deserving of being considered an ""ape"" (as anthropomorphized human being). Ultimately, here Caesar falls into the same pit as his human counterparts, as well as Koba, condensing the life-sensitive worth saving. For Koba, it's just apes that serve all his whims. This is solely for many of the people themselves.Deceptively, for Caesar, it is worth saving only that life which fits his morality criteria (which is indeed a comparatively compassionate one). However, I am informed that Koba's breathing toward the credits is being heard and that the character of Caesar after his attempted execution of Koba has not been morally resolved.

114,fernandoschiavi,"In the ironic tragedy of evolution, the nature intrinsic to the two species - homo sapiens and simius sapiens - is, after all, the same",8,21 November 2020,"In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, ten years after the conquest of freedom, Ceasar (Andy Serkis) and the other monkeys live in peace in the forest near San Francisco. There they developed a community of their own, based on mutual support, while humans face one of the greatest epidemics of all time, the simian flu (which, however, was developed by humans in the laboratory) and which wiped out much of the world's population. Without electricity, a group of survivors plans to invade the forest and reactivate the plant installed there. Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the only one who knows the apes well, tries to act peacefully and prevent the confrontation from happening.A prologue to the script is portrayed in defense of family and property, showing a human society more devastated than ever, while the social organization of apes has also reached unprecedented complexity. They act in society, hunting, learning from their elders, taking care of each other. In charge of all this is Cesar, more mature, with some white hair and wrinkles from the experience he lived with his peers since we saw him disappear in the forests neighboring San Francisco. There is no (at least in principle) a dominant group. What is there are humans that also behave like animals and primates that sometimes act according to the most developed rules of coexistence of men. It is not even possible to be sure who started the confrontation that the title announces. Was it, then, the triumph of the individual, independent of the species? It is also not that simple.Although the plot revolves around the tension between the two races, the narrative does not leave out internal political issues for each group, in addition to the individual motivations of the characters. These elements deepen the plot, guarantee different layers throughout and reflect the complexity of our own society. The franchise known for working on political and social issues returns to touching on these issues without boring viewers, unlike The Inception, which oversimplified these aspects. With quotes ranging from the soundtrack of ""2001 - A Space Odissey"" to the battles of epics from the 60s, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is cinema committed to the viewer: to amuse him and make him think. It is darker than ""The Origin"". No less efficient. It has action and provocation in the measure. On both sides there are pacifists, who try to live harmoniously with the different. However, like real life, the thoughts of those who crave power prevail. Those who prefer to extinguish the opponent than try to live in peace. By bringing these themes to the fore, the film joins the list of blockbusters that go beyond pure spectacle.Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, wrote an excellent script that illustrates the behavioral similarities between apes and humans in a masterful way. Especially when there is so much hate and prejudice involved, something that in the film is common to both species. On the human side, Carver (responsible for the shooting, played by Kirk Acevedo) feels angry and blames the monkeys for spreading the disease that killed countless people. This feeling is common to most humans. On the other hand, Koba, overcome by a huge desire for revenge, believes that apes can and should get the better of humans while they still have the advantage. And right in the middle of them are Malcolm and Caesar, who believe that there is a way to live together peacefully.It is on a fine line that Caesar will need to balance his leadership, his family ties and his desires, desires and aspirations in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. His leadership is more than consolidated among the monkeys and his noble posture impresses Malcom, his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and his partner Ellie (Keri Russell). Caesar's pacifism needs to consider all possible angles of all actions and a confrontation between the races is not in his interest, but the hatred between humans and monkeys does not allow enough time for mutual explanations and arrangements - even more so when an ape himself does question of launching into the air a universe built on fragile and suspicious relationships.The complex, malicious and treacherous Koba is the film's great antagonist - and Tobby Kebbell's performance capture is superb. The scarred bonobo - on his face and body - suffered for years in laboratories and does not trust any human being. Ironically, he is in charge of building an intrigue of Shakesperian contours, emulating the most sordid human characteristics and not thinking twice before crossing a line of coexistence defined as a fundamental rule by the apes themselves: monkey does not kill monkey. Koba tries to assassinate Caesar, corrupts Blue Eyes, and sets his own village on fire to provoke an inevitable war between monkeys and humans.If James Franco - who starred in the previous one - did not return, the cast corresponds to the smart script to match. From Jason Clarke and Keri Russell, as the conscious couple who try to resolve situations in a peaceful way, Gary Oldman, always competent, in the shoes of the leader who wants to override what he believes to be the inferior species, and Andy Serkis. Once again the actor lends his features to a character created from the performance capture - it was like that in ""The Lord of the Rings"", with Gollum, and in ""King Kong"" by Peter Jackson. His talent is helped by an increasingly efficient technology: sometimes we are more moved and involved with the monkeys, their looks, their features. It is possible to capture in your eyes and in both actions all the emotions that we are used to seeing in a human being, from joy and sadness to hatred and hopelessness.Several issues are addressed, but the one that stands out most is the difficulty in accepting and understanding others with all their differences, especially when there are deeper problems. It is much easier to simply point out the defects, errors, than to put oneself in place and try to understand. Sometimes reason needs to speak louder than emotion, or impulsive acts end up happening and causing unnecessary friction. Do you realize that prejudice is there? That senseless hatred makes humans act without thinking and thus jeopardize their own existence and that of the entire planet? The writers and director Matt Reeves delve deeper into the subject, without ever forgetting that it is a blockbuster designed to earn a lot in the summer of the northern hemisphere, a great film made to be released in the middle of the year and please the maximum of people possible. And they manage to tell an original, captivating and tension-filled story, filled with exquisite computer graphics.In visual effects, we have the return of Weta Digital, going beyond the work that was already spectacular in the first film, creating other digital animals besides monkeys and taking performance capture to a new level. The work of the Planet of the Apes technical team - The Showdown is so impressive that for most of the film you will wonder if those monkeys are actually created by computers, size is the degree of realism achieved - in a larger number of external shots and in adverse climatic conditions. Apes walk towards the construction of a humanized lifestyle and this is noticeable in the most evolved vocalization, in the expressiveness of their faces, capable of expressing a myriad of emotions and feelings without the need for dialogue, and in the physicality of body movements, which express the animalistic stance of the creatures at the same time that they begin to indicate the first signs of a simian humanization - visible also in the grandeur with which the horses ride.Technically impeccable, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes establishes a gloomy and darker environment than its predecessor. Photography and art direction make up a San Francisco in ruins that impresses, with the world being completely taken over by nature, vegetation that flourishes on all sides. Matt Reeves demonstrates an excellent sense of composition in the action scenes, building a complex clash at night involving monkeys mounted on horses, multiple weapons and even a battle tank, which does not disengage in the confusion of the various coordinated fronts because of the correct positioning camera and the subtle beauty of fire and explosions that sparkle across the blackness of the scene. The director also allows himself to start from the sensitivity of the great initial sequence, which in silent plans reveals the apes' lifestyle and the contours of that nascent civilization, to the malignity of the scene in which Koba pretends to be an ordinary monkey to steal the weapon of two human beings and murder them with extreme cold moments later.From the memory of his creator and friend Will, James Franco's character in Rise of the Planet of the Apes - relived in the respect that is born in his relationship with Malcom and in the return to the rubble of his first home in a moment of sadness and pain -, Caesar realizes that goodness can germinate in humans in the same way as in apes - as well as evil. How much humanity did the evolved monkeys inherit? He had never noticed how human the apes were. To think that monkeys were better than humans was his mistake - and a mistake that took too high a price. In the end, Caesar realizes that there are no absolute and immutable truths about the two races. With a pessimistic ending, which leaves the way open for its conclusion in War for the Planet of the Apes, we also foresee in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes that the fate of the apes seems to be to erect a civilization as vicious as the human. In the ironic tragedy of evolution, the nature intrinsic to the two species - homo sapiens and simius sapiens - is, after all, the same.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
115,KalKenobi83,A Great Follow Up To Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes,10,25 April 2015,"Watched Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes with Jason Clarke(Zero Dark Thirty) as Malcolm , The Lovely Keri Russell(Mission :Impossible III) as Ellie ,Kodi Smit-McPhee (Footloose) as Alex ,Kirk Acevedo(Invincible) as Carver, Gary Oldman(The Dark Knight Rises) as Dreyfus ,Toby Kebbell(RocknRolla ) as Koba, Judy Greer(Love And Other Drugs) as Cornelia and Andy Serkis(Lord Of The Rings) as Caeser , Is it necessary to see this movie in less than no time because of the original story with surprising twists? Nope, not at all. It's not really that exciting and even a normal chimpanzee can predict the outcome. But, it's the amazing design of the apes and the sometimes real human actions and emotional traits that they show. Probably the fact that the actors are ""motion captured"" has something to do with it, but it's still breathtaking to watch. At certain moments the CGI wasn't quite correct. Especially the fragments of the horse riding apes. You can notice sometimes that these were computer animations. But that's really nitpicking. The Most part looked lifelike and one can only conclude that the authentic episodes of ""Planet of the Apes"" from the 60's were irrefutable populated by costumed actors.The final confrontation between humans and apes, with Caesar, again played by Andy Serkis (who formerly also performed as Gollum in TLotR), and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) as the two righteous leaders of the two parties, is of course inevitable. Clearly a socio-political theme was ingeniously woven throughout the cheap, ordinary Hollywood entertainment. The mutual distrust with revenge as the cause for the sneaky tricks and treachery. One group is angry because the apes are supposedly the origin of the extermination of mankind. The other group is unnerved by the years of abuse in laboratories and a doomed life in captivity. The result, of course is a clash with also some internal feuds and conflicts. .

116,agmoldham,Good series,6,27 July 2014,"I suppose the biggest problem the new reboot of planet of apes faces is that we know where the story ends. It's good to report that there's a great deal of fun in the journey though. If you haven't seen the 1st movie of the new reboot then I certainly recommend watching this as the second movie does assume that you are up to speed with the storyline.The start of the movie goes through the breakdown of the human race as a worldwide outbreak triggered at the end of the first movie results in the vast majority of the human race perishing.We then got on with the second movie as after a number of years without contact the remaining humans in San Fran make contact again with the apes led by Caesar. Most of the film focuses on the tensions within the ape community and that mirrors similar tensions in the human community.The movie is pretty entertaining throughout and quite thought provoking.

117,swilliky,An amazing sequel to a reboot prequel and addition to the Apes franchise,8,15 July 2017,"The sequel to the reboot prequel uses the amazing motion capture technology to bring a darker backstory to the original classic. Caesar (Andy Serkis) leads a society of apes that hunt and live in the redwood forests. During a hunt, a bear attacks Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and Caesar nearly dies fighting it but Koba (Toby Kebbell) saves him. When humans stumble upon the apes' home, Caesar speaks, telling them to go. He sends Koba after them to follow. The group of humans is led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who returns to the human settlement in San Francisco to tell the leader of the human society Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) about the apes. Carver (Kirk Acevedo) shot one of the apes and fears what the apes can do. Ellie (Keri Russell) used to research the disease that wiped out most of humanity at the CDC but sees no signs of any further contagion. Malcolm's son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) left behind a sketch book allowing the apes to see the extent of the society. Koba, recalling the ill treatment in the labs, believes they should attack the humans but Caesar cautions against war.Caesar leads a show of force to the gates of the human society and tells them that he does not want a war. Dreyfus is ready to go to war but Malcolm pleads with him to let him go up there and reason with Caesar. He has to take Carver along since he knows the how the power works at the dam. At the apes' fortress, Malcolm is brought to Caesar. Despite Koba's doubts, Caesar lets Malcolm show the dam to the apes. Dreyfus sends men to the armory and Koba sneaks into it though he is caught by a soldier. The men are caught off guard when Koba plays stupid. Caesar has a family to worry about as well and does not want to sacrifice apes in a needless war. He allows Malcolm and the other humans to work on the dam. The apes save the humans lives when an accident leaves some of them trapped in a tunnel but a tense altercation with a baby chimp, Blue Eyes, and Carver shows that trust is still difficult between the species.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
118,bob-the-movie-man,High class monkey business,8,21 July 2014,"There are some films you go to see with low expectations and back in 2011 Rupert Wyatt's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was one of those. After the Charlton Heston classic, a long series of increasingly poor sequels and a failed Tim Burton reboot, apprehension was high. But how wrong could I be. This was 100% a 10/10 film (if I'd been doing these reviews in those days): an epic and gripping story; great performances from James Franco, John Lithgow, Freida Pinto and Harry Potter star Tom Felton; and stunningly executed special effects, with Andy Serkis's performance delivering amazing depth of feeling and emotion. (The scene where Serkis's character Caesar first speaks is one of my top 10 ""most goose-bumpy"" moments in cinema history).Now, 4 years later, we have the sequel - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - which, given how much I loved the original film, I approached with a similar feeling of apprehension. But, I am delighted to say, I was pleasantly surprised.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes neatly takes over in its opening titles where the closing titles of the first film left off. The so-called Simean flu has wiped out 499 of every 500 people on earth, deftly explaining why James Franco and Freida Pinto fail to reprise their roles in the sequel: in fact it would have been an unrealistic cop-out if either had done. Instead - monkey business aside - we have a brand new human cast led by Jason Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty"", ""The Great Gatsby""), Keri Russell (""MI-3's"" 'bomb in the head' girl) and heavy hitter Gary Oldman. These characters are trying to rebuild a new society for the survivors in San Francisco, but their desire for power (of the volts and amps variety) puts them in direct conflict with the emerging simian society deep in the redwoods. Much conflict ensues, not only between the two tribes but between the factions of the two societies.Once again, there is a good story by original writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, joined by Mark Bomback: underneath the set-piece action sequences, the majority of the drama comes from the relationships between the characters, and especially that between Caesar (Serkis) and his estranged son played extremely well by Nick Thurston, culminating in a remarkable stand-out scene between the two in Caesar's old home that is genuinely moving. And another specific callout was Yorkshire-born Toby Kebbell playing the emotionally and mentally wounded Koba: his scenes in the human armoury - think Heath Ledger's Joker crossed with PG Tips advert - are both funny and distubing in equal measure.Is it as good as ""Rise""? No, not in my view. The first film was novel and deep, and ""Dawn"" is more superficial in comparison. It is also far more of an action film (or ""a bit fighty"" as my dear wife described it), with some standout battle scenes that are a masterpiece of special effects. If ""Rise"" could be compared to the original ""Alien"", ""Dawn"" is much more like ""Aliens"" - wham, bang, thank-you Simian.The director this time is wunderkind Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"", ""Let Me In""), directing with panache and a narrative drive that only occasionally lets up for emotional punch. The acting is good and (as flagged above) the special effects are outstanding: the production team clearly saw ""I am Legend"" and wanted to go one better with the San Francisco streets. And all topped off with a fine and un-obtrusive score by Michael Giacchino.Highly recommended, and I am now looking forward to the next sequel, planned for a 2016 release.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my library of other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to ""Follow the Fad"".

This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive: where things are dying, where people survive off liquor and cigarettes, where those who are supposed to love us drive knives into our backs. There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice and, of course, talking apes. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and violence.

121,vampire_hounddog,The best of the trilogy,7,8 August 2020,"In the 10 years since Caesar (Andy Serkis) escaped captivity with the other apes and they left to live in the Redwood forests outside of San Francisco, a virus wiped out most of humanity. When a small group of humans stumble on the ape compound while in search of a dam for water and other survivors a great deal of mistrust exists between the humans and the apes with the potential of both tipping towards violence.Whereas RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2011) merely served as a prelude to this better film, it is in effect a superb re-imagining of BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (1973) with good guys and bad guys on both sides clearly delineated. Serkis most assuredly has more to do in this film and the action and production design are superbly handled. Followed by WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017).",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
122,jdkraus,The ape movie people have wanted for decades,9,30 July 2014,"Who would have thought that Hollywood, a place that masters illusions, could give us talking apes that ride on horses, fire guns, and interact with humans without turning it into a something ludicrous or even laughable? ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is such an achievement. It demands us to take its subject matter seriously and it does so with persuasive reasons. Set 10 years after the ALZ-113 virus has obliterated most of the human race, apes and the surviving humans remain as the two main species. The question of who will rise as the dominant one becomes the predicament as tensions between the two skyrocket into all-out war. The film exceeds just as much in its action sequences as it does in its more neutral moments. The apes are fully developed characters, who communicate perfectly with sign language (accompanied by subtitles) and the writers present these creatures with enough material to make their characters comprehensible. The meticulous motion-capture improves the film's plausibility. For all 130 minutes, I thought I was seeing real apes communicating with one another. The visual effects are that convincing. Just as successful is the story. For an ""ape"" movie, the story is original and much darker in tone. The comparison of human's distrust and paranoia with one another to apes becomes an apparent driving force in the plot. Instead of humans battling each other, there is a situation of apes against apes. They too can have differences that can cost lives.While the apes garner much attention, the supporting human characters take a backseat. Great talent like Gary Oldman has very little screen time, and is only given one short scene for his character. It's a poignant moment, but it feels almost wasted for such a phenomenal actor. Other characters are equally disregarded. The center-most point of the film though is the relationship between the ape leader Caesar and the lone human father Malcolm. It is a nice interaction to view, for both value the same goal of peace and unification, whereas the others of their kind desire the opposite because of past wrongdoings and misunderstandings. It's human and ape nature to fight what they fear and hate. Only the few and smart can see the good over the bad. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a great feat in movie-making. It is the ape movie that audiences have wanted for decades.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Man has been decimated by a virus and the Apes have grown in strength. You do have to suspend your belief at times as the plot is pretty lazy to be honest especially concerning the predicament Man finds himself in. The acting isn't great either, Gary Oldman's character is unbelievable and the rest of the human cast though not awful are merely OK. On the plus side this movie is visually very impressive and the CGI is brilliant. For all the flaws in the plot the film roars along at a great pace and is full of impressive set pieces which leaves you little time to get bored.

125,Dan1863Sickles,A Superb Picture Even From A Purist's Point Of View,8,16 August 2015,"I hated RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES so much that I refused to even see DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES when it was in theaters. Last night I saw it on a rented library DVD and I was absolutely amazed!Let me explain where I'm coming from. I saw the original PLANET OF THE APES on television as a 10 year old in 1973. I waited months to see each sequel as it came on TV. The apes and their world were the center of my childhood. I am an old school Apes purist and I loved the culture, philosophy and political commentary of the original films so much that I truly dreaded the new series. But this time around, they got it right. From the first few minutes I was mesmerized by the intensity of the apes, the beauty of the scenery and set design, the power and simplicity of the dialogue, even when (especially when) it was mostly delivered in sign language. From a purist's point of view, DAWN is not so much a sequel to RISE as a brilliant re-imagining of the fifth and final film in the original series, BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES. The plot is basically identical. Having won equality and a new start, Caesar attempts to create a simple, rural civilization where humans and apes can peacefully coexist. But when an evil ape consumed by race hatred (species hatred) decides to take the law into his own hands, both Caesar's life and his family's future is at stake. The thing that impressed me so deeply is that the same plot was far more powerful and dramatic the second time around. The characters are more nuanced, and the performances more tragic. General Aldo, the gorilla bully in BATTLE, plays much the same role as Koba in DAWN. But the two characters are so different. Aldo was a big, dumb bruiser, and nothing more. He was a bully, and he saw himself as superior to humans. Basically he came across like the mean, redneck sheriff in a Burt Reynolds movie. Koba, with his scars, his blinded eye, and his horrible memories of life as a lab specimen, is a far more tragic figure. His sly, Machiavellian cunning and his utter lack of remorse remind me of Shakespeare's classic villains. Watch the scene where he infiltrates the human settlement and gets two redneck survivors to lower their weapons with fatal results. The ease with which the embittered, scarred ape becomes a clowning, playful monkey (just for as long as it takes to get his hands on a gun) literally sent shivers down my spine. This level of subtlety and the darkness it evokes is reminiscent of Herman Melville's work in stories like BENITO CERENO. Everyone remembers Andy Serkis as Caesar, but I think Toby Kebbell's performance as Koba was just as remarkable. And though many other reviewers have surely mentioned it, I was struck by the fact that the name Koba was used quite intentionally by the film makers. Koba was Joseph Stalin's first alias when he was a young revolutionary in Czarist Russia!The first hour of the movie is absolutely riveting. Only the final half of the movie drags, a little bit, because the film makers couldn't resist the big battle scene with the machine guns and the explosions. Frankly, my impression was that Koba would have overcome the human colony without even needing a battle. He was that clever, and that chilling. But I want to say that as brilliant as the ape performances were, the humans, particularly Gary Oldman as the corrupt colony leader and Keri Russell as the caring human doctor, were solid and convincing as well. This movie was a wonderful surprise. It has restored my faith in the Planet of the Apes as both a sub culture and a way of life.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
126,Shopaholic35,It should have been so much better.,7,12 February 2016,"I wish this movie didn't take so long for something to happen. I was halfway through before it started to get interesting. I wanted action not a heartfelt gorilla in the mist storyline. The special effects were absolutely magnificent though and their surrounds were so imaginative. What's scarier than the animal kingdom, or specifically our ancestors rising up in a war between the species. Probably a lot of things but I still found it quite frightening. I think the scariest thing for me was that the apes began to take on bad human traits. Committing acts for survival is greatly different from seeking power and revenge. I'm used to it with humans but I expect better from animals.The one thing I can't get my head around is even after a decade of living in a post apocalyptic wasteland the humans still had a plentiful supply of automatic weapons and ammo. The only thing guns are good for is conflict and it's pretty weak for the creators to rely solely on them to instil fear.Overall the movie really could have been better.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
127,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,6 August 2017,"The first film clearly elevated the franchise to a very high level of quality, but it still had its flaws ... Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes those issues and solves them while improving everything else that was already great!Once again, Caesar (Andy Serkis) is an outstanding character! It's amazing how I feel so connected to an ape, a very powerful, emotional ape that leaves me at the edge of my seat every time he's in action. Andy Serkis deserves every Oscar there is for his unbelievable performance, he is, without a single doubt, the best motion capture actor ever! What a role!If there's another standout from this second installment, it is definitely Koba (Toby Kebbell). He steals every scene he's in! He's great when fighting and he's very passionate about his perspective on the human race, something that is very well explained and demonstrated throughout the film, giving this character the reason behind his ""evil"" personality.Also, this time around the human characters got a little more development than on the first movie, as it can be seen on Jason Clarke's great portrayal of Malcolm, who brings the emotional human- ape relationship to some very compelling and captivating moments.The visual effects are flawless and incredibly realistic. I mean, there are close-up scenes to an ape's face ... That seems like a freaking real ape! It's that good! In addition to this, the action is awesome and there's a lot more of it than on the previous film. When it goes down, IT GOES DOWN! Just incredible direction from Matt Reeves, congratulations for an extraordinary work!I only have a couple of minor issues: once again, the pacing is a little bit slow, but it did improve compared to the first movie. Some human characters are just assholes because the plot demands them to, instead of being the script (which is also a bit expositional) to justify their actions. However, these are very minor problems that I have with this amazing film!Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves on everything Rise has: marvelous visual effects, well-developed characters (apes and humans), awesome action and a captivating story, with an astounding amount of emotion and compelling moments during the whole runtime. Matt Reeves' direction is near perfection and Andy Serkis declares, once and for all, that he is, in fact, the best motion capture actor ever!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

This movie completely rocked though, I really enjoy not seeing people in monkey suits, and the seamlessness of all of the scenes where Man, and Monkey are face to face. The special effects are just that good. There seems to have been something in that serum they took that makes them really good with guns as well as sentient, but that is somehow never touched on, and the only flaw I really noticed. 10 years later, and the world has changed so much that most people will not believe it possible, but you take us out of the picture for a couple years, and everything will grow right back so it all fits really well. As in the last film there is a strong bond between Cesar, and a few of the humans as he is really the only ""ape"" who was really ever treated well by ""us"". Gary Oldman is good as the leader of the survivors who has lost everything, and only wants to save what's left of humanity, until these talking ""animals"" show up, and get in the way. Cesar is such a powerful character, that you can easily believe that he is real, and actually interacting with the other characters, in fact all of the simians are so well developed, and full of life that you will definitely have your own favorites in no time. Really worth the $300 that it costs to go to the movies (where they have smaller cups, and no longer give refills. What's that about?) but if you want a great movie that the whole family really will enjoy, and though there may be some stuff to scary for the little ones, there are also some really heart warming moments that you will wish they saw if you hadn't brought them along, so your call, but that's how I saw it.

129,griffolyon12,Apes Strong!,10,11 July 2014,"Sometimes there are movies that are simply awesome, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one such movie. A sequel to 2011's Planet of the Apes reboot, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up ten years after a manmade virus, spread via lab experimented apes, has killed most of the human population on Earth. The small pocket of immune humans left find themselves coming into conflict with the genetically evolved apes, led by ape hero, Caeser, in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco. To say anymore would rob you of the experience that this film has to offer, because Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of those movies that reaffirms why I love movies in the first place.This is one of those rare films that actually transports you into another time and place for two hours and convinces you to invest in characters and struggles that are very different than your own. It is through the magic of movie-making that we are able to do this, but not every movie always succeeds in doing so, however Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does.I think one of the best words I can use to describe the construction of this film is confident. There is confidence in the way that director Matt Reeves chose to shoot many of the scenes in one shot, there is confidence in the way that the script foregoes traditional exposition for seeing rather than hearing, and there is tremendous confidence in the way that the filmmakers have used motion capture technology to realize the titular apes. Everything about this film is phenomenal, from top to bottom. All of the behind the scenes talent create this seamless science fiction world that is believable at every turn. I believed for the two hours of this film that there really were talking apes and not just CG-layered men and women in motion capture suits. A great deal of the believability is a testament to the folks at special effects house, WETA, for realizing the apes and creating texture in their hair and in their skin, selling the illusion. However, WETA and the filmmakers could not have sold the apes without the actors portraying them.While most people will talk about the noticeable human actors that play human characters at the fore (who are all awesome in their parts by the way), the real standout performances come from the human actors portraying the apes. By wearing dots on their faces and special gray suits, flesh-and-blood people became flesh-and-blood apes through the magic of computer technology and animation. Everything these actors did on set, their movement, line readings, and facial expressions, are all relayed in the ape characters, but it is the human soul behind the apes' eyes that really make these ape characters memorable heroes and villains.Just like he was in the first film, Caeser is a sympathetic hero, conflicted by his former love of humans and his desires to keep his fellow ape safe. Motion capture acting extraordinaire, Andy Serkis (Gollum from Lord of the Rings), continues to carve out what is quickly becoming his signature role here as Caeser. While Gollum may have more scenery to chew on, it's with Caeser that Serkis is able to show the wells of emotion deep inside of him in ways that he's never been able to show in previous movies. The fact that he got top billing in the credits made me extremely happy, and it's about high time the Academy recognized motion capture work and voice-over work as acting performances.Speaking of performances worthy of recognition, actor Toby Kebbell very nearly steals the whole show from Serkis portraying the villainous ape, Koba. Koba is the best kind of movie villain, one who is driven by more than a lust for power, but a deeply felt motivation of hatred for the humans who kept him in a cage and tortured him long ago. Whenever Koba is on screen, it's electric. You don't know what the character is going to do, and that is all thanks to Kebbell's performance. He turns Koba into a real live wire that easily rivals any recent movie villain like Loki, and if time favors this film like I believe it will, rivals the likes of Darth Vader. When Koba and Caeser fight in a climactic battle at the end of the film, it's as awesome as any lightsaber duel or superhero smackdown.So in case you haven't noticed, I am over the moon about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It is the first movie this Summer that I actually felt like had transported me, and that's what I yearn for from a good sci-fi or fantasy film. Of course, not only is it entertaining and emotionally involving, it's also a film that actually has deeper themes beneath the surface, dealing with ideas such as race and species relations, war versus peace, and the importance of family and community. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a rare kind of film, one that maybe only gets made every year or two, if we're lucky. This is true blockbuster movie-making, relying on story, character, and experience, more so than action bombardment.I give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a 10 out of 10!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
130,mahmus,Amazing,9,3 July 2020,"When Rise of the Planet of the Apes was announced, I didn't think it would be that good. To my surprise, it was.When the sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was announced, I knew it would be good. To my surprise, it was even better.Having recently seen the original 1968 Planet of the Apes for the first time, I have gotten a new level of appreciation for the reboot trilogy, this film in particular, which is my favorite of the three.To see the beginnings of the ape civilization is fascinating, but it wouldn't be nearly as interesting if it weren't for Andy Serkis' incredible performance as Caesar. Him and the Visual Effects artists had already brought this incredible character to life in the previous movie, but here, they cemented him as one of the decade's most memorable heroes.Also, the effects. Just, wow.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
131,MrDHWong,One of the best sequels I've ever seen,9,9 July 2016,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the 2014 installment in the Planet of the Apes franchise and the sequel to 2011's Rise of the Planet of Apes. I consider it one of the best sequels I've ever seen. Not since X-Men: Days of Future Past have I seen a sequel this great. The franchise has had a new lease of life breathed into it ever since the 2011 reboot and this film certainly follows on with that.Picking up 10 years after the events of the first film, human civilisation has collapsed due to the ALZ-113 virus that had been released on the world previously. The intelligent ape Caesar (Andy Serkis), now middle-aged, rules a new generation of apes along with his son River and his vicious lieutenant Koba in a relatively peaceful society. However, a small group of human survivors of the virus soon threaten the ape society with their violent ways and their use of guns. As a result, a battle for the dominant species of Earth eventually erupts.Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar was once again fantastic. I feel he deserves some kind of honorary award for his work in this film. The other apes were all very convincing as well. The film also serves as a commentary on misuse of guns and other firearms, as the humans are constantly using them against the apes to assert their dominance over them. When the apes start to learn how to use them, the tables seem to be turned.I rate ""Dawn"" a 9/10 and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed ""Rise"" and the ""Apes"" franchise in general (except for the 2001 remake).",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
132,cliftonofun,Me like apes (even if it is still just another action movie),7,26 December 2017,"Probably my favorite Planet of the Apes movie ever. Granted, that means very little, but still. This edition truly humanized the apes...partly because of the approach and partly because of Serkis. I was pretty moved and engaged for the first 60 minutes or so. It eventually devolved into an ape action flick, complete with an ape Rambo...but it still mostly worked. Especially when seen as a metaphor for how humans relate (and fight) across lines of difference. I'll stick around for another sequel!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
133,Laakbaar,"""Dawn"" is a worthy sequel to ""Rise""",8,20 July 2014,"Gosh, I really enjoyed this movie. My high expectations were fully met. This is a technically amazing, gripping and well-written film.It is also an intelligent and thought-provoking film. A lot has happened to us since 1968. We root for the apes now. We have integrated the imminent destruction of our planet into our value system. Mother nature striking back seems right to us. Trust and conflict are the main themes in this movie. The villains are yahoos and hotheads.What surprised me most was the technical artistry in showing both the anthropomorphism and the simian nature of the ape characters and this new strange simian society. With only very few exceptions, it all seemed utterly life-like to me. This all raises issues for me about what a movie like this actually is. What did I watch exactly? You can't call it just computer-generated animation, but nor is it ordinary acting. Our cinematic technology seems to have taken a quantum leap. In the first movie we had human actors in plastic masks, but now we've elevated this concept, this franchise, into something wondrous.I don't know enough about movie making to know who else is responsible for this exactly, but the movie credits includes a huge list of designers, make-up artists, technical people and so on. I suppose Weta Digital played an essential role.I don't think it is absolutely necessary to have seen ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" first in order to enjoy this one, but I do recommend it. However, these two movies are unrelated to the earlier movies. You needn't see the earlier Planet of the Apes movies to understand and enjoy these two. However, I appreciate the way they are trying to stitch the two series together. And I like the neat scenario they've developed to explain how a planet dominated by apes could arise.One quibble with this movie is with the depiction of weaponry and firefights. Why was there such a huge stockpile of weaponry there? Why were the humans living in a fortress and still walking around with guns? Who would they be shooting at? It's like being barricaded and armed is the ""default setting"" for American film makers. ""The power has run out! Barricade the door and fetch the gun!"" Except extend this for ten years. I suppose I (as a movie goer) reacted the way the film makers wanted, and this reflects a certain reality in America, but I found it annoyingly cliché and unduly American. This movie could have been made without the heavy firepower. I suppose we should be grateful there were no monstrous lizards or robots, no enormous flying spacecraft, and no superheroes.Another quibble was that not enough time was spent showing us the human survivor group and how it was able to function exactly.Also, I suppose it's unrealistic for apes and a simian society to evolve like this after only ten years. This wasn't adequately explained.But let me tell you: none of these quibbles ruined the film for me. I would go see this one.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
134,dfa120374,"If You Enjoyed The 1st Film, Then You're Sure To Enjoy This",8,25 January 2015,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare breeds of film where the sequel is better than it's predecessor, and boy, how much so. While I enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes, for me this sequel is on another level for everything from the amazing visual & special effects to the development & characterisation of the apes.This film takes place 10 years on from the outbreak of ""Simian Flu"" and the human population has been all but eradicated while apes have learned to adapt & become more intelligent. When the apes - led by Caesar - and humans encounter each other, a trust gradually begins to evolve between the two, but that trust is thrown into jeopardy when Koba, Caesar's ""No. 2"" comes up with a plan that will cause the two bands to go to war with each other.Another rarity with this sequel is that it has a good story to go along with the fantastic visuals. All too often a lot of big movies attempt to blind you with effects to make up for the lack of storyline, but that's not the case here as the story, while maybe a little bit predictable, blends a good deal of tension and suspense. There are also underlying messages within the storyline too, with the main one being that with all that has gone on before, you still get the humans that act in a manner that causes ill will.The visuals, as I have mentioned before, are stunning. From the realistic look & movement of the apes to the ruins of a demolished San Fransisco, everything is so seamless. I enjoyed the way that Caesar - and the other main apes for that matter - was portrayed as well....they gave him a kind of real on screen presence that seemed to give him that Alpha male kind of dominance. With all this new motion capture, as well as other techniques, it just goes to show how far movies have evolved with the technology available now.Add a good cast to all of the above and you have a very enjoyable movie.This is definitely one that is worthy of at least an 8 rating.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
135,cinematic_aficionado,Let's go ape,7,18 July 2014,"Humanity's new arch enemy are...primates. But, aren't we their biggest enemy having driven them almost to extinction? in any case, let's go along with the storyline.Wasting no time in introducing a world where humans became almost extinct due to a man made virus going viral, the story is situated around San Francisco where some human survivors live in close proximity with a well organised group of apes who have evolved sufficiently to think and talk like humans.It soon becomes clear that the two sides think of one another as enemies and appear ready to launch an aggression, still there are those in both camps who think peace is a more preferred option that hostility. Can these voices prevail though in the midst of an overwhelming desire for full blown clash?Whilst the built up to the main story was almost instantaneous, it proved effective in creating an atmosphere of tension that remained throughout the film. At almost any moment the audience thinks that mayhem is about to ensue. We follow the voices of peace in an uphill struggle to maintain the fragile peace where you cannot be sure who is the ally or the adversary.There is also a moral element to this film: as a leader it is sometimes preferable to compromise for the sake of the common good, even if your inner circle does not share that.Good ambiance, effective action and a tension prevailing throughout makes for a rather edgy two hours on the big screen.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
136,billygoat1071,Strategy Against War,10,10 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes jumps right into the time when the apes are beginning to build a new civilization while mankind is starting to fall apart. What makes this different from the last feature is it once again sticks more to its symbolism. Now this is the real deal of the context, it's obviously a truce between two sides, it is the part that is mostly known as the last chance before the unwanted fate of their world happens. Since everybody knows how things are going to turn out (regarding this as a prequel), it still provides the heartfelt tension of their trust to each other. Unlike Rise, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes doesn't only throw off a visual effects gimmick on screen, it also deeply focuses on the compelling themes beneath the tale.Whatever legacy that was left from the last movie is the character development of the ape. Caesar has grown understanding more how the world works, his sympathy with the humans remains and he can still believe in peace in them and his own kind. However, anyone else in both sides stayed naive, paranoid on what they're planning to do. It doesn't lack any information, the rubble already shows the crisis going on in those streets and the characters are given their own backstory to effectively define their motivations, thus this is a situation which is far from good vs. evil. The real enemy of this conflict are simply fear, cynicism, and sometimes revenge. It is a dilemma that is a few steps closer to the edge of their trust. And that is how the whole story works, it makes the audience real nervous about the decisions each of the characters make.Even when it's already packed with a great director and a great cast, the film still manages to keep on telling the story straightly, like exactly pinpointing the allegories without distracting any demanded pleasures that you would typically ask from a blockbuster. But as said, it still offers those elements when necessary. Director Matt Reeves gives this franchise a whole new tone. Blockbusters today tend to be ultra serious and darker, but Reeves is one of the rare directors who could live up to that ambition. He doesn't only bring the atmosphere, there are also some nicely shot action scenes that deliberately displays the horror and violence of the battles.But the merits doesn't end there of course. The acting is stellar, mostly pointing at the man behind the leading ape, Andy Serkis. He's always been terrific in this job, but here there is more gravity and grittiness to the performance than before, whether it's physical or vocal. The motion-capture performances just add a lot of exceptional value to the CGI work which could totally outshine everything else in the filmmaking. The actors who played human characters also did good, with Jason Clarke handling his role well.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is more than a stunningly made film, it thoughtfully considers real depth within its storyline which results an overwhelming experience even without an excess of action. There is already suspense existing at the complexities of the species' treaty. The battle scenes just becomes the gravy of it, but really, the analogies is what makes it really compelling. After years of attempting to bring back the original spirit of the series, the filmmakers has finally realized that this is what this mythology is all about. Except it has become grittier. The film just triumphs in its choices, which it's almost difficult to call it a blockbuster, because blockbuster asks you turn off your brain. This movie makes you open your heart.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
137,Rickting,Another amazing blockbuster from 2014,9,28 October 2014,"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes was one of the 21st century's most pleasant surprises even if it went on a bit. 10 years later, the virus released in the first prequel has wiped out much of humanity and the apes and humans try to avoid a war. We all know it's going to end unhappily, but the tricky thing is to speed towards the inevitable conclusion while still being compelling and entertaining. Do the filmmakers manage this? Yes, and then some. This isn't monkey business; this is a compelling, emotionally involving and viscerally thrilling blockbuster with both brawn and brains. Like it's predecessor, it's too long and it is predictable, although the predictability is pretty much unavoidable. There definitely was space for a bit more stuff, so this feels underfed. Aside from that, the film doesn't take too long to get going. 2 individuals involved have been snubbed: Matt Reeves and Andy Serkis. Matt Reeves is blatantly an awesome director, shown by this and 2010's Let Me In, and the fat that this is only the third directing gig he's got is ludicrous. What's even more ludicrous is Andy Serkis' lack of awards. Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar nomination. Maybe one day he's get the credit he deserves.The rest of the cast are great as well. Gary Oldman doesn't appear that much, but he stands out. As stated earlier, we all know where the film is going, but there are various deviations from expectations. For example, you expect Gary Oldman to be an antagonist who wants to destroy the apes for no reason, but his character's far more well rounded than that. The script, for a blockbuster, has striking amounts of emotional depth and the movie is actually very affecting throughout. Visually, the film is a showcase and virtually every frame brims visual awe and has loads of stunning sequences. A highlight is a long, uninterrupted shot on the top of a tank. Overall, the film is a powerful post apocalyptic thrill ride which feels genuine and honest, yet also provides a white knuckle thrill ride in which you are emotionally invested in the thrills. This may be a controversial thing to say, but I think this is the best of the franchise so far (although I've only seen Planet, Beneath, Rise and Dawn) and just beats the excellent original.9/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
138,DareDevilKid,These Apes Rule!,10,24 July 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsNothing, absolutely nothing, in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" falls short of being spellbinding. An emotionally heavy and truly moving film, Dawn is an absolute marvel of modern science fiction, building upon the strong and unmovable foundations ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" had left earlier. This sequel to the 2011 ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" continues the origin story of a world devastated by a killing virus and partially occupied by super-intelligent chimps, gorillas, and orangutans who live in harmony in the California woods. Suddenly they are threatened by a band of human survivors and eventually reach a fragile peace treaty, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species. As the film begins, they haven't seen a human for 10 years and believe us to be extinct. With a plethora of solid characters from both ends of the tale (humans as well as apes), an explosive sequence of events, and a rather poetic script, Dawn raises the bar for the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise reboot and other big-budget, philosophical sci-fi productions of its caliber.This lavish sci-fi epic really is something that deserves appreciation; few movies in our day can only dream of achieving what Dawn has. A film that truly touches its audience with heartfelt passion and remorse for humanity along with hitting all the right notes as far as providing blockbuster entertainment is concerned; ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is that rare summer blockbuster that boasts a perfect harmony where art meets excitement on a level playing field.Both Rise and Dawn are thought-provoking films that challenge our perceptions of our very own species through the eyes of the mammals we've evolved from. The film wrenches our guts and compels us to delve into our psyches through some highly pertinent questions it raises albeit in a subtle manner. Along the way, Director, Matt Reeves, successfully weaves an enthralling post-apocalyptic narrative against a riveting, grimy, desolate canvas brilliantly created by cinematographer, Michael Seresin, and production designer, James Chinlund. All three gentlemen as do the writers, Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, rightly deserve all the recognition and accolades that might come their way in the next awards season. The writers' greatest achievement that goes even beyond the fine script they've penned, is perhaps some of the most hard-hitting dialogues ever witnessed on screen, delivered with aplomb by the Czar of motion-capture acting, Andy Serkis. Lines such as, ""You are no ape"", ""If we go to war, we could lose all we've built. Home. Family. Future"", ""Caesar loves humans more than apes"", ""From humans Koba learned hatred"", and ""Apes started war, humans won't forgive"", are nothing short of writing gold. Technically, the film is a marvel of modern cinematic achievements. The visual effects work superbly, and the director uses 3D unobtrusively. The most remarkable effect may be the animals' eyes, formerly a weak spot in motion-capture animation.Just as its predecessor had memorably done three years ago, Dawn triumphs spectacularly in a way few films before it have done so; through unsolicited and unforced emotion and depth that makes the film a true modern science fiction classic, something that the original creators of the Charlton Heston classic would be very proud of. Stunning visuals, stupendous camera-work, pulsating action, rich production values, notable performances, and an emotionally stirring plot rooted in human tumult all culminate into making ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" not just one of the best summer blockbusters ever, but an instant sci-fi classic that will surely wind up among the year's best movies.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
139,dragokin,do you still complain about the 2001 movie?,2,26 December 2015,"Just when i thought that Rise of the Planet of the Apes laid the groundwork for the reboot of the franchise, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes moved the boundaries.In this movie a good measure of James Bond and Rambo are mixed into the Planet of the Apes universe in order to make it more of an action thriller. This mixture proved to be successful at the box office and at the same time made this movie indiscernible from any other contemporary action movie.There are some very nice moments within the apes' community, but they get squandered with the aforementioned mixture.So, if you're looking for a ""different"" action movie, you've found what you've been looking for. Otherwise go for Tim Burton's 2001 movie if you wish to see the best of the Planet of the Apes universe.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
140,TheSquiss,A satisfactory stepping-stone towards an epic 3rd chapter?,6,16 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves sequel to Rupert Wyatt's 2001 reboot of the classic series, is a more than satisfactory second chapter but is not without its flaws.Almost a decade after the outbreak of ALZ-113, most of the human population has fallen victim to either virus or violence. In an Ewok village on steroids in Muir Woods, just beyond San Francisco, Caesar (Andy Sekis) and his right-hand ape, Koba (Toby Kebbell) preside over his vast tribe of intellectually enhanced simians. Under the assumption that humankind is now extinct, the simian community lives as the dominant force in their kingdom.Meanwhile, within the confines of San Francisco, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) have established a large community of survivors out of sight of the apes. When their energy supplies run out, however, Malcolm, Ellie (Keri Russell) and a small team venture into the woods to see if they can harness energy from the hydroelectric dam. The apes see them, there is a standoff, one of the humans shoots an ape and the threat of war looms.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes rolls along slowly and it takes an awfully long time to really 'kick in', prompting much fidgeting. But the groundwork is necessary to bring us up to date on the apes' evolution, the humans' worsening situation and to build the tension steadily enough for us to invest time and emotion in it. This isn't a simple movie of goodies versus baddies but of varying shades of right and wrong, of misunderstanding, arrogance, quick tempers and failed diplomacy.Writers Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver must take much of the credit for crafting a story that engages the audience and makes us want to know the whys and wherefores while refraining from spoon feeding us every morsel of information. Much is left for us to wonder about; other than fleeting references, there is no explanation for the fate of Will and Caroline from the previous installment. However, while they take their time establishing the first act and rattle the third act along with gusto and gunfire, there is period of protraction in the middle where they seem unclear on how to join the two ends of the film.I am loath to pick on the writers as so often they are blamed for a movie's failing and rarely credited for its successes, but I'm afraid on this occasion they are at least partly responsible. For a good fifteen minutes last night, the seat shuffling was inescapable. We all knew a battles was brewing, we all wanted to see it bubble over but there was nothing we could do but wait for writers and director to work out how to make it happen.Of the principal cast of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, only Andy Serkis returns, as Caesar, in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Both physically and vocally Serkis has become the go-to guy for motion capture performances and he proves yet again why. It is easy to forget there is an actor hidden behind the pixels in many of the apes but particularly in Caesar. Only when we see a baby chimp does the CGI look awkward but, though the dialogue is a little cheesy at this point, it allows for some emotional attachment between audience and apes that is necessary for the final act.The human characters fare less well. Clarke lacks the charisma here to mark himself out as a solid leading man and one can only hope that the reason for his blandness will be explained in episode three. Keri Russell is wasted here and her scenes could be excised with very little impact on the film. While Ellie does enable the apes to edge closer to trusting the humans, it is a great pity that Russell was give more to play with.Likewise, Kodi Smit-McPhee has a central part to play as Malcolm's son, Alexander, in two short but enjoyable scenes (a sequence where he looks up to see the apes watching and waiting patiently is lovely) but there is nothing here to make him memorable or hope that Alexander lives to see a sequel. Gary Oldman is given the most meat to sink his teeth into but even he is prevented from making the impact that Christopher Nolan allowed in the Dark Knight trilogy.Director Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Cloverfield) has built on the success of the first installment (of the reboot – we'll ignore Tim Burton's awful attempt to reignite the series) and, though I don't think we'll ever regard Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as a stand alone classic, it works well as a quietly exciting middle chapter of what is certain to be at least a trilogy. With a sequel slated for a July 2016 release, this has laid the groundwork for Reeves to let rip with a no holds barred battle epic that should up the ante on the thrills and the bloodshed.For now, though, we must be content with an imperfect but largely enjoyable stepping stone from dark beginnings to the bloody thrills of futuristic warfare.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
141,RevRonster,This cements that reboots can be better than the original!,10,30 July 2014,"I enjoy the classic franchise from the 70s and I really enjoyed the reboot origin story that was ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (I didn't really care for Tim Burton's remake, however) and, when I saw the first trailer for ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" I was a little bit excited and my expectations were truly high. Thankfully, the film delivered and delivered in a big way.First off, the story builds tremendously on the last film. 10 years have passed and the world is a completely different place but, at the heart of it all, this new world feels legitimate and thriving ape society and remnants of the last surviving humans all come off as convincing. Also, the story does a fantastic job of making this film more than just a Sci-Fi tale about apes slowly becoming the dominate species on the planet and gives the film substance and heart. There's tons of tender moments, light-hearted sequences, exciting action scenes, some heavy drama and a lot, A LOT, of emotion to all it that helped in making the events and characters sympathetic. I'm not saying the film had me tearing up during bits but I'm definitely not NOT saying it.Next, you have the impeccable cast that was composed of both animated characters and flesh and blood actors. Without a doubt, this is the best performance I've seen from Jason Clarke and, even though we found out he's kind of a jerk, Gary Oldman still keeps his track record intact and does a great job as the film's human villain. However, the biggest highlight was Andy Serkis as Caesar. We already know Serkis as the God of Mo-Cap but he continues to show that he really can breathe both life and soul into computer animated characters.Serkis can really make the animated characters give off realistic performances but a part of that equation is having talented animators to make the character look realand they really did an awe-inspiring job. The level of detail they give the apes is flippin' insane and to such an extent that it was easy to lose yourself in the action taking place before your eyes and make you forget that what you are watching was rendered in a computer. When you combine these talented animators, realistic looking creations and absolutely incredible actors giving them life, you have yourself characters that are less of a computer generated spectacle and more of characters that are providing to and enhancing the film's drama, tension and emotion.I walked out of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" with absolutely no complaints about the film. Everything about it—from the cast to the visuals and camera work to the effects—were all put together and blended perfectly to make a film that is unlike anything that was seen in the cult classic franchise. I am really looking forward to the next film in the franchise and to see the continuing story of CaesarI'm also looking forward to the day the Academy finally realizes Andy Serkis' greatness.Hello there, my friend!

142,davidgee,Monkeying with history,7,25 July 2014,"Assuming that this latest incarnation of the APES epic is going to be a trilogy, like Spiderman's, DAWN is the holding one till we get to the grand (temporary) finale. The parallel war and peace initiatives make up almost the entire plot. Caesar and Koba fight for supremacy over the simians, Malcolm and Dreyfus try to drive the humans down different paths.What makes this movie a fairly outstanding episode in the saga is the quality of the cinematography and, of course, the CGI. The blend of actors into apes is stunningly well done, giving the creatures pretty well the same individuality as the human characters. The fight scenes are thrilling (I watched the 2D version), and the sets and locations give a wonderful sense of a city (San Francisco) sliding into decay and ruin. There's little likelihood that another movie can replicate the amazing 'reveals' at the end of the two Charlton Heston blockbusters that first introduced us to this topsy-turvy version of our future history, but DAWN, like RISE (the titles would have been better in reverse order), is a worthy addition to the currently popular genre of 'Origins' movies.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
143,PyroSikTh,"In-depth, thoughtful blockbuster",9,29 July 2014,"Dawn picks up ten years after Rise in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The virus has spread, wiping out most of humanity, while simultaneously boosting the apes who have thrived and bred. The film opens with the apes, with the fate of humanity left a mystery both to them and us (if you haven't seen the trailer, anyway), as a telling conversation between Maurice and Caesar tells us they've seen no humans for two winters. Suddenly there's an encounter as the humans who have settled in nearby San Francisco have branched out to fix a dam for electricity. What commences is two hours of political tensions as the humans negotiate to continue their work on the dam while the threat of war constantly looms over both communities.What the film does do great is blur the lines of villainy. There are individuals on both sides who could be deemed villainous, despising everything about the other side. In a way you can almost sympathise with everyone as well. Koba has a deep-seeded mistrust and hatred of humanity due to the mistreatment he suffered by their hand, while Carver and Dreyfus see the apes as nothing more than animals and do what they can to defend themselves. This mistrust between these two sub-factions escalates as Koba sees the human's weapons as a threat. Is Koba wrong in trying to pre-empt the human's actions? And are Carver and Dreyfus wrong for making sure they're armed just in case? No, not really, and yet they are quite obviously the antagonists.Another thing the film does really well is run parallels with current politics. In particular the climax near the end becomes very reminiscent of the Nazi's gathering up and shutting away the Jews because they're different and unapproved of. On the flip side there's also a parallel to how muslims are often treated today; hated as a whole thanks to the actions of a few. It's not Muslim exclusive, but it's one of the most prevailing intolerances in the world today that leads to many of our conflicts. As is in real life, the movie makes a point to show it goes both ways, as I mentioned with the Koba/Dreyfus mistrust. Without trying to spoil too much, there's also a polarised succession that results in a division of one of the communities, and the loyalists of the old leader are treated the same as the enemy. A straight-forward summer blockbuster, Dawn is not. It's seeped with social and political commentary, some subtle, some not so much.As with Rise, the true stars of Dawn are the ape actors and CGI team. Andy Serkis is on top form as always, bringing more of a dominance and rugged experience to Caesar than last time. As an ape, he's starting to get on a bit, and his aged wisdom certainly shines through. Judy Greer gets under the CGI costume as Cornelia, Caesar's mate, but she literally lies around for three quarters of the movie, stands up defiantly, and then is never seen again. However the actor/ape of the movie is easily Toby Kebbell as Kobi. I'm a huge Toby Kebbell fan. He's a hugely underrated actor that keeps getting stuck in bad movies, or in this case is unrecognisable, but honestly his performance as Koba as unparalleled. He's terrifying and threatening while also giving the movie some of it's only source of humour. Also, if there was any ape in this movie that truly showed how intelligent they really are, it's Koba. He may be the villain of the movie, but he's probably become my favourite character of the franchise so far.The CGI has stepped up hugely since Rise. While in Rise, there were moments where you could sort of tell the apes were CGI, here it's easy to forget. The amount of detail on them is phenomenal, not just in their movements and facial expressions thanks to motion capture, but also how their fur works, and the furrows in their brows. Even the ape's tongues are rendered to absolute perfection. I literally cannot fault these effects. Not even a little bit. It brings the ape characters to life. Just like in Rise, they're each given an individual personality which makes them instantly identifiable. My only real criticism of Dawn is the inconsistency in ape communication. They start the movie pretty much exclusively using sign language. They can write and read as well, but no big point is particularly made of it. However, by the end of the movie they're speaking full sentences to one another. Obviously it was a creative choice to build up the amount of ape speaking, in a way maybe to reflect the urgency and tension of the inter-community politics? However I just felt it was a bad choice. Can all the apes talk, or is it just a few? Why use sign language if they can all just talk to one another?Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a solid addition to the franchise that even surpasses the quality of Rise in just about every way. The effects are better, the acting is better, the story is better, hell the climax in Dawn is actually a satisfactory conclusion whilst simultaneously setting up the next movie. As I said, the only thing I can fault through nitpicking is the ape communication, but let's be honest, that's not really enough to ruin your enjoyment. I give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a fantastic 9/10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
144,ClaytonDavis,Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell need Oscar consideration...for real,8,12 July 2014,"Very few sequels outdo their predecessors. Some will credit Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather Part II as the greatest sequel of all-time while I find the wonder and amazement in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back as the best science fiction film of all-time. When the first trailers started to appear for Matt Reeves' Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the follow-up to Rupert Wyatt's reboot from 2011, I was ready for ""Cheesefest 2014."" I thought we would have apes and monkeys speaking long, drawn-out stories about politics, life, and love. Similar to Tim Burton's reboot failure from 13 years ago. What we get in this stunning edition is an action-packed, multi-layered story that stands as the definitive summer blockbuster. Actually, thinking about it, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes isn't just a summer blockbuster, it's a full on dramatic epic. Starring Andy Serkis as Caesar, the film takes ten years after the events of the first film. Humans have been nearly wiped out of the Earth, and Caesar and his fellow apes have built a civilization in the wooded and abandoned San Francisco area.The growing debate about motion capture is put to the ultimate test in this second installment. For years, fans and pundits have championed the talented Serkis in his role as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings films, most pertinently in The Two Towers. Other films followed with a similar argument including James Cameron's Avatar since then. In the 2011-2012 awards season, some critics came around to the idea. Serkis scored a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Supporting Actor, a huge feat for the motion capture community. I'll be honest, I've never embraced the idea of an actor getting recognition for this type of performance, not that I'm against the notion, I just haven't seen something that made me champion a performance....until now. Serkis' turn as Caesar this time around is a fully realized and gracious work that stands as one of the great performances of the year. It's a gorgeous triumph and the highlight of the entire picture.What makes the film even more special is that Serkis is not the only actor that shines this time around. While Serkis has carried the torch for motion capture actors for years now, he has some company in Toby Kebbell who plays the conflicted and vicious Koba, Caesar's right hand ape. Kebbell's multi-layered and glimpse into his inner-darkness is stunningly profound. He raises a plethora of intriguing questions about the nature of justice and the power of vengeance. Unrestrained, violent, and at times, downright terrifying, Kebbell is sensational.After sadly losing the Visual Effects Oscar in 2011 to Martin Scorsese's Hugo, Reeves' film is ready for a second bout. Everything that sings in the film is due to the visual effects team. There's a big pay off to the intricate detail they spent on each character. The entire technical team should be applauded. A panoramic look through a perspective of a tank along with a reflective look through a window, Cinematographer Michael Seresin emotes as one of the most exciting veteran DP's that we should be ashamed to have forgotten. Composer Michael Giacchino knows how to set tempo, build excitement, and pull back when necessary. His score is pretty darn spectacular on every musical note.Where the film falters unfortunately is in the development of the human characters. Trite, boring, and utterly predictable, especially when it comes to the women, leave much to be desired. Jason Clarke's Malcolm balances some of the over-the-top back stories with true, natural talent. Equally effective as James Franco in the first one, Clarke continues to explore his acting options well as his career continues to elevate.I love nearly everything about Keri Russell. I feel she is a phenomenal talent that has proved her abilities several times over including currently on FX's ""The Americans."" Unfortunately for her, she's relegated to virtually nothing with the occasional screaming of Malcolm's name, and a lazy back story that involves A-typical female behavior. I'm very pleased to see Kodi-Smit McPhee getting older and growing into himself. I thoroughly enjoyed him here. Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman kind of wallows around the film. There's no real arc to his character and if you pluck him out, I'm not sure if anything changes. Overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets the job done and does it well. Astounding direction by Matt Reeves that blows anything that Garreth Edwards did in Godzilla look like a high school musical. It's one of the best surprises of the year along with being one of the finest. The film is now playing in theaters.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

146,MovieHoliks,Probably The Best In The Entire Series So Far..??,9,9 June 2015,"I'm pretty sure I've seen every movie in the long line of the ""Planet of the Apes"" series of films going back to the original 1968 picture that started it all. The 2001 Tim Burton remake- I enjoyed, but didn't think it really added anything new- just more people in monkey suits LOL. I heard that one of the biggest criticisms of the 1995 film based on the Michael Crichton novel, ""Congo"", was that they hadn't yet perfected CGI'd realistic looking fur yet, so again had to resort to guys in monkey suits. But with the recent couple films in the reboot series, they plainly have perfected the fur, but at the same time, I don't think the apes themselves look completely realistic. No matter- these last couple films- this movie, and 2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", I think are the best in the series so far. ""Dawn of the POTA"" picks up so many years after ""Rise"", after human civilization has almost been wiped out completely due to a Simian flu, and what few remaining humans are left attempt to restart a power plant near where our hero of the last movie, ""Caesar"", and his band of apes are taking up space. I think that even though the CGI hasn't yet perfected completely realistic looking apes/animals, we still get a good glimpse of the emotions from the creatures- THAT's where these recent couple movies have excelled. No James Franco this time, but we do see remnants of him in Caesar's memories- quite touching actually. Well, anyhoo, I'm going to go as far as to call this movie the best in the entire series yet, with ""Rise"" being a close second. I look forward to the next in the series, ""War of the Planet of the Apes"", due for release in 2017...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
147,abcvision,Angry Apes,6,12 July 2014,"I really enjoyed the story line of the first planet of the apes. It really drew you into feeling empathy toward Caesar who was drawn into the human world even though he was an ape. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 2, the story line has shifted. Caesar now leads a colony of the apes and the peace is disrupted by the corruption of the humans. This creates a faction between the apes and a war with the humans. Very intense shooting scenes and at times you can't tell who are good guys or the bad. The lines of what is right and wrong continue as the humans opt to step back for the apes to figure it out among themselves. The movie also spends a lot of time building up the story to prepare for Apes 3 that it seems the filler of shoot them up attacks within the fog of war are used as filler before the end credits get you set for the next movie installment.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
148,Al_The_Strange,From NOOOOO!!! to GOOOOOO!!!!,9,15 July 2014,"After the apes rose up in rebellion and fled San Fransisco, a plague descended on mankind, setting the stage for the inevitable clash of two cultures. With human civilization in decline and ape culture on the rise, it is a fragile and fearful time for all. It would only take a few bad misunderstandings to set off an all-out war between men and apes.That's pretty much what we get in this follow-up to Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It starts off a bit slow, but builds momentum and tension as the two sides of the conflict rub together. By the last act, it becomes a shooting war. It's not quite as tight as the first film, especially since your enjoyment could hinge on whether or not you care for the human and ape characters. However, the film doesn't linger too long on the drama, even though the film is attentive to all sides of the conflict.What matters the most is the story. Not only is is a sequel to Rise of POTA, but it also borrows the plot and ideas of Battle for POTA (which, ultimately, remains the weakest of the franchise thanks to its cheap and dated look, and poor execution of the story). Dawn improves on Battle substantially, if for no other reason than it gives the characters a fresh new life and emotional anchor that audiences can latch onto (specifically, regarding Caesar and his ape tribe; the human characters have their moments, but never really take the spotlight enough to make us care). The story proceeds to underscore the key themes behind the apes' civilization - the moral battle between taking action or enforcing pacifism - and it's a struggle that endures for the entire picture and drives the characters. It all builds up to a moving tale of treachery; the ultimate turn of events mirror the takeovers and oppression of typical human dictators, and the film provides a stark reflection on how the rage of a few unchecked individuals could ruin peace for everyone.This film is crafted with decent photography. Acting is not bad; the ape characters easily steal the show, with Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell bringing their characters to life marvelously. Gary Oldman is as great as ever, although his role is pretty small. Jason Clarke is okay. Writing is good. This production uses quality sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music seems quaint, but it works.This sequel continues the chronicle of the new POTA saga sublimely, and for anybody who enjoyed Rise, Dawn should satisfy.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
149,ArchonCinemaReviews,Longwinded plodding narrative told time and time again,5,16 February 2015,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes shows the world at the brink of turmoil and war, humans threaten a community of apes, the victor being the emergent dominant species.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to the 2011 remake of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a continuation of the 2001 Planet of the Apes.It is ten years after a deadly pandemic swept the United States. Scattered in settlements are the survivors, barely holding on, one such settlement is in San Francisco where fuel levels are at a critical level. A group goes out to search for an alternative source of energy and comes into contact with a community of genetically evolved apes in the forest. When the two opposing factions collide they are drawn into battle due to misunderstanding, ignorance, mistrust and the instinct to survive.Never having seen any of the previous Planet of the Apes films, not even the originals, I cannot attest to this film's story continuity in relation to its predecessors. As a standalone film the plot itself is self sufficient and intuitive in its progression. The narrative within Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not original, and its pedantic telling using apes as a metaphor is monotonous and long winded.The film itself is over two hours long, which is completely unnecessary and extremely detrimental to ability to captivate the audience. By the one hour mark you are already longing for the film to progress in the expectant manner, which it does, it just takes an entire hour more. Fans of the franchise won't find this at all off-putting but those with an affinity for science fiction or action films could easily find a superior substitute elsewhere.Watching Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a cumbersome experience and in the end feels more like work to get through rather than entertainment. Though the visual effects are remarkable at emulating simian expression, body language and movement there is still too much obvious CGI to get lost in the narrative.Please check out our WEBSITE for all reviews of the recent releases and blockbusters.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
150,edgeofreality,Epic yet empty,6,21 July 2021,"The first half works better than the second and the apes upstage the humans. While the look and movement of the apes is effective, I still prefer the old 60s film in this department, where the more human stances and clothes made the apes fascinating and more fun to watch. The human characters are no match for Charlton Heston either. Worst of all is the semi-soap opera feel of some of the emotive scenes and the deadly dull piano music that drones on in the background, adding a wearying portentousness. It aims for an epic quality but forgets that epics require larger than life, ambiguous characters with universal interest, and even the best ones here -Caesar and Koba- are not quite that interesting. In fact, the only truly interesting part was not the fact that apes are proven to be just as capable of evil- their rivalry for leadership, from which human power hunger possibly stems, is well-known; it is the newsreels of the effects of a virus in the prologue. What is happening to the world in the 2020s was clearly predicted back then. How long ago 2014 seems! Back to the film: another issue is it feels long because it saves dull and predictable action for the end, by which time the mind has switched off. How much better and unforgettable was the end of the1968 version when films were still mainly aimed at adults...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
151,chicagopoetry,Dawn of the Planet of Meh,5,12 July 2014,"Count me as one of the people who was completely bored with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The story makes absolutely no sense and therefore I couldn't get into it. I just thought it was meh.1. The apes have been living out in the forest for ten years now, can still barely speak about twelve words, but they ride horses? Really? Where are the stables? How do they train the horses? What do they feed the horses when there aren't any hay fields or even fields of grass around? How did they make those fancy reins for the horses?2. Caesar has known Malcolm for three days and trusts him and thinks of him as a friend for some reason? Why? Malcolm hasn't done anything to gain said trust. He's there for selfish reasons, to get that dam working. They don't have any meaningful conversations. Caesar can barely speak twelve words. True, they save Caesar's wife from some type of illness, but Malcolm doesn't do that, the female doctor does that. And about that. The wife is on her death bed and the doctor gives her some antibiotics and shazam she's up in less than a day? Huh?3. The climax of this movie is basically just the ending of the Lion King with monkeys instead of lions.4. There's just way too much CGI in this film. It's impressive at first but after a while it's just like watching a cartoon even though it is realistic. 5. I didn't really care about anyone in this film, was given no reason to. Not enough time was spent with the apes, or with the humans, when they were doing anything but shouting and shooting guns, for me to get to know any of them. I was bored.6. The 3D did nothing but distract me. Instead of getting absorbed into the little story that there is, I was like, wow look at how that stump looks so much closer to me than the apes are, while missing whatever was actually happening.7. All the subtitles were just idiotic. I don't know if they were using real sign language because I don't know sign language, but it seemed to me the subtitles said a lot more than what a few hand gestures could represent. Was there some reason the apes couldn't just, you know, talk, and talk in a conversational manner instead of barking and grunting out words? Caesar has had ten years since he spoke his first words. He should be talking as well as a thirteen year old does by now.8. There was a lot I just didn't understand. If the vast majority of the human population has been wiped out by the flu, why aren't there corpses all over the place? Why did they even let the bad guy who shot the ape at the beginning come back with them, when they knew he couldn't be trusted? Where did the camcorder with the scene from the previous film come from all of a sudden? How did they fix a gigantic dam with nothing but wrenches? How did Caesar suddenly recover from his gunshot wound at the end to go on and fight Kobo? Why did he tell Malcolm that he was ""a good man"" when Malcolm hadn't done anything particularly good to deserve it? And there is so much more that just didn't make sense to me.9. Basically this is a very loud, in your face, not subtle at all film that doesn't take any time to develop characters or get you emotionally involved in anything. It's just a lot of CGI action and yelling. I thought it was boring.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

154,david-meldrum,"Entertainment with heart, guts and soul",8,20 July 2014,"If it's not hard enough to remake/reboot one of the more loved cult movie series in cinema history without alienating fans of the original, film-makers make it harder on themselves when the films in question are about talking apes. Tim Burton had already tried - and largely failed - to recreate Planet Of The Apes in 2001, with a film high on visuals but low on most other things. So when it was all tried again - this time from the beginning - in 2011's Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, expectations were not high. How wrong we all were. It was an intelligent, chilling, engaging triumph - most of all in Andy Serkis' brilliant motion-capture performance of lead-ape Ceasar; but there was more. The human interest story worked; the performances worked throughout the story had a brilliant momentum. It was, at times, genuinely disturbing; and it never forgot to entertain or amuse.Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes picks up right where the previous film left-off; a credits sequence portrayal of the spread of the simian flu virus setting us up for an advanced colony of apes outside of San Francisco and a decimated, bruised and battered humanity struggling in vain to make some kind of life for itself. From there human and apes come into contact, and conflict builds: between ape and human, ape and ape, human and human. Andy Serkis is back again, with a wider supporting cast of motion-capture performances. His colleagues are good - he remains utterly outstanding, and long overdue major award recognition. It's a performance provoking awe, fear and joy in equal measure and is a masterclass of its type.In a blockbuster season which again sees Michael Bay return to milk the Transformers cash machine with all attendant hype, cynicism and disregard for the viewer, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes represents everything the big blockbuster could and should be. Thrilling, intelligent, artful, entertaining - and not overlong. It's a worthy sequel; not a perfect one. Like the predecessor, the script has weaknesses. Occasionally the inter-human interplay is somewhat forced. Other than that, it's as it should be, and all the better for it.

155,michaelarmer,All Hail Ceasar,7,28 February 2020,"I know that all the ""Planet of The Apes"" films might seem related or sequels of, but they are not. This is actually the first sequel to Rise of The Planet of The Apes, which was not related to the other ""apes"" movies, and has not much to do with either the first series 1968-1973, the 1974 TV series, and the re-make film in 2001. confused ?, so was I, but I am trying to fathom it.On its own it is actually a very good film, and better than ""Rise"", it is very thoughtful and has a great story line, A virus has killed most of the human population (timely review this with Covid-19 on the spread at the time of writing) with the few remaining living in the ruined city and the advanced apes living in the forest, of course they come into conflict, but some try to keep the peace whilst others are trying to kill. Its a usual story in mankind except this time one of the sides are apes.It is acted well and directed well, the scenes are well done, photography is excellent, the sets, particularly of the ruined city are great. The CGI is not too brilliant though, a bit better than in ""Rise"" but still not flawless, the apes and other creatures look great, its just when they move, it does not look natural, I know it isn't natural, but they are supposed to make it look natural, but it is getting better. The music was average.I have watched all the original films and these modern ones and there's one thing that bothers me though, and it is quite obvious if you think about it. We humans evolved from apes, and we look like we do now after millions of years evolvement, So why are the apes (apart from those medically enhanced) so advanced after only a few years, and in the old series, after being evolved for 2 thousand years, why don't they look more like us, more upright and less hair?
They should have consulted an Anthropologist before creating the costumes/CGI.But its a film, not a documentary, and it is sci-fi/fantasy, so I can't grumble too much, besides it is good, and if it had better music and CGI I would have rated it higher, possibly a 9.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
156,socrates99,"Out of the summer biggies, this one is so far the best",9,14 July 2014,"If I'm going to be drawn away from my humdrum life, I want something convincing and compelling going on that will make me feel as if my time was well spent. With very few exceptions this movie fits the bill.There's a lot that's uncomfortable about meeting a superior species that movie makers like Ridley Scott have mined profitably, but what if we were being challenged for planetary superiority by an inferior species? What would be our reaction? Sheer terror? It would be hard to imagine if we were at full strength and this movie acknowledges that. It begins with the now intelligent apes not sure whether men still survive. (They've been decimated accidentally, by their own hand.) Some do survive and they might have lived separate and apart from the apes if not for one thing: the apes control the area around San Francisco's power source, a hydroelectric damn.Now you might construct a reasonable expectation in your mind of the kind of shenanigans that occur, but what you will not see coming is the extreme artistry and insight displayed by almost everyone involved in making this movie. It really makes the old Charlton Heston movies seem almost as crude as crayon drawings.These apes under the leadership of Caesar (James Franco's rescue from the first movie) have developed to the point they know right from wrong. Though they too struggle with doing their best, they are clearly as worthy of world domination as we are. And for most of the movie I suspect the audience is on their side. That by itself is worth the price of admission given the way most people look down on animals.My only (slight) disappointment was that Keri Russell doesn't have as great a role as she could have had as she's a favorite of mine, but Andy Serkis and whoever is responsible for making him look as convincing as he does are almost breathtakingly convincing and masterful. The execution here and in the rest of the movie, is, to my eyes, well nigh flawless and, therefore, irresistible and moving. The standards on display are way above anything I've ever seen before and even outdo Gravity, the previous high point.In short, this film is not to be missed. It's a great one-of-a-kind entertainment.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
157,gsygsy,Serious monkey business,4,10 August 2014,"There are amazing technical achievements to gawp at in this movie, but sadly they don't prevent it sinking under the ponderous, cliché-ridden script, which contains scenes so poorly written they made me wince.Worst of all, the sexual politics of the piece are insulting to half the world's population, and don't reflect at all well on the other half.Here there's none of the lightness of tone that was such a feature of Franklin Schaffner's 1968 movie, which enabled Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans to be so playful in spite of the restrictions imposed on them by their comparatively inflexible make-up. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES rarely rises beyond doom-laden. The overall impression is of people taking themselves far too seriously.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
158,LloydBayer,"An epic with heart, soul and insight, Dawn is a technical marvel & a milestone in filmmaking.",9,25 July 2014,"Never has a sequel achieved such distinction in storytelling by seamlessly blending science fiction with reality. More than just an epic blockbuster packed with equal parts heart, soul and insight – Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is as much a technical marvel as it is a quintessential milestone in filmmaking. For lack of better words, in its entirety, this film is the dawn of the evolution of cinema as we know it.One of the closing questions I asked in my review of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (one of 2011's curve ball hit films) was – Will we as humans eventually cause our own extinction and in the process allow another species to reign supreme? Not only is that question answered with such precision, returning script writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver spins such a yarn, this time around, that cinema's core ethos of 'make believe' is taken to unprecedented new heights of storytelling. In crafting this illusion of reality, Cloverfield director Matt Reeves gives us a glimpse of a bleak future that is in every way a stark contrast to James Cameron's fantasy world in Avatar. Set ten years after the events of the preceding film, a simian flu called the ALZ-113 virus has all but wiped out mankind. When a band of survivors led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Ellie (Keri Russell) seek to restore power to a decimated San Francisco, they encounter a new generation of apes led by the super intelligent chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis at his brilliant best). As a proud and noble alpha male, Caesar is compassionate to humans as well as his tribe of apes thriving in the woods surrounding San Francisco. But in allowing humans access to a hydro-electric dam, both sides have at least one major obstacle to overcome. Koba (Toby Kebbell), Caesar's deputy bears the scars of human cruelty as a lab test subject. On the other side, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) a trigger happy military man blames the apes for the outbreak of the virus that killed his family. At this point, it's needless to say that peace between humans and apes bear a striking similarity to the current state of socio-political diplomacy in the real world. Similarly, for Malcolm and Caesar, the fragility of peace is tested on the strength of trust and forgiveness, each with depleted levels on both sides.After much inter-species finger pointing in the first hour, Reeves lets loose flaming arrows by way of a spectacular battle sequence, but not before tightening each passing minute with cork-screw tension. Each passing minute also leads to metaphors that serve to illustrate our bloody history of wars, mutinies, and conflicted leadership. Just like the preceding film, Dawn raises a few questions that strikes fear into the heart of the viewer because the film's most unnerving question is not about who we are but about what we have become. This is Kebbell's moment as a perfectly camouflaged Shakespearean Brutus. Kebbell's portrayal of a war craving despot is second only to the highly watchable Caesar in what has to be Serkis' most charismatic performance to date. Although the accolade of blurring the lines between virtual reality and live action cinema firmly rests with New Zealand based studio Weta Digital, thinking that an ape has been trained to act while also knowing that it is a product of CG animation is the greatest achievement in this film. That being said, human characterization seems to have taken a back seat in the process as more than 75 percent of the production favors the apes with every minute detail dedicated towards their emotions, aesthetics, communication and path to civilization. As such, Oldman and Russell have little to work with, relying on Clarke to shoulder human elements of the story.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes can be easily misread as an analogy on the current state of real world events and the mounting tension that is bringing nations to the brink of war. But under the guidance of Reeves, this film is primarily a stunning visual experience with all the sophistication yet none of the camp silliness found in other big budget productions. Apart from the photo-realistic aplomb of motion-performance technology, James Chinlund's production design is perfectly integrated with Michael Seresin's cinematography of a post-apocalyptic world in a way that doesn't require a 3D viewing. Together with Michael Giacchino's goose-bump raising original score, something tells me these technical achievements will not go unnoticed. For now, Caesar lives. And through this film, be prepared to be conquered all over again!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
159,avik-basu1889,All Hail Caesar !!!!!,10,25 November 2014,"The script for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes starts 10 years after the climax of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The apes have built their own establishment and civilisation and they are leading peaceful lives. But one day 2 apes suddenly come across a few humans(who they didn't think still existed) and a spell of continued tension begins.I was surprised by the depth of the screenplay. The film is about race relations, slavery, war, politics and also love and family. We are allowed to witness proceedings from the point of view of both sides. Both sides have loving and caring families,both sides have individuals who genuinely want peaceful coexistence and not war, but there are also individuals on both sides who are unwilling to consider anything other than fighting a war for asserting a supremacy over the other side. This could easily have been a movie about a real conflict between two nations and it would have still felt convincing. The screenplay and direction by Matt Reeves is absolutely brilliant. On the surface,this is a summer blockbuster, but to be honest it is so much more than just that. The undertones about diplomacy and how easily the line dividing peace and war can get erased through extremist influences are fascinating to observe.However after mentioning all that about the direction and script, the film still won't be the film it is without the characters and the actors playing them respectively. Caesar is without a semblance of a doubt one of the most charismatic leaders ever put on film. Andy Serkis as Caesar is absolutely flawless. Serkis can be now easily called the master of motion capture, he really doesn't put a step wrong. Toby Kebbell is equally good as the intimidating and extremely intriguing Koba. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell also deserve a special mention. The great thing about the film is that although there are characters whose opinions you might not find agreeable, but still you will understand the motivation and the mindset of these characters and reasons why they think the way they do.Lastly, I will have to admire the cgi work. The movie looks astonishingly good. The apes look completely real. The opening 10 minutes of the film only focuses on the apes which to some extent reminded me of the opening sequence of 2001:A Space Odyssey and even the score in some scenes resembles that of 2001. The ragged and deserted streets of the cities reminded me of The Walking Dead and there is one long sequence with a single take that reminded me of the long take from Children of Men.In a nutshell, this is an absolutely glorious film. Not once did I find myself disengaged during the film. There are uses of unnecessary minor clichés in some parts for additional emotional effect, but they are not enough to make me give the film anything less than 10.This is a 1000 times better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes and I loved Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
160,maxglen,A superior sequel in almost every sense,9,4 March 2021,"I liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes, like... REALLY liked it; this is no secret to those who know me or have read my review of the film here on iMDb, but Dawn is a film that holds a special place in my heart, not only because the film is spectacularly made (although that certainly does help) but also because of the circumstances in which I first experienced it which I will get to in a bit. First off, I'll start with what you will first notice about this film, the effects; the CGI in this movie is absolutely incredible, in the first scene alone we see these beautifully rendered apes, lining the trees in preparation for a hunt and the lighting is spectacular as well as the texture work on their skin, fur and depth and wetness of the eyes. They feel real, even now, and for a 7 year old movie? That's pretty impressive. I forgot to mention how this scene also happens to take place in the rain which adds another element of challenge but they pull it off superbly. I mean, you can see each individual raindrop effect each individual ape's fur! Next up on the block is the narrative, now, although admittedly nothing too special, I think considering the approach this film took with it's story, it's done as well as it can be done; I think the lack of truly original story is what drags this down from a 10 for me but I can't hold it back too much as there is only so much you can do with a post ape uprising earth, and what they do do (ha) is done to a tee. The acting is pretty top notch, I think almost every actor does a pretty solid job but the real standouts here are Andy Serkis as Caesar and Toby Kebell as Koba... wow. Possibly the best motion capture performances I've ever seen. Koba is a deeply damaged character who when we start the film, see has calmed down quite a bit now that he is living free with his own kind, away from the humans, but as the film goes on and he is reintroduced to the human threat, he breaks under the pressure and his scars reopen, it's really great stuff. Caesar continues on his natural trajectory from Rise and is now the leader of the California based ape civilisation we saw birthed in that prior movie. We see him struggle with leadership, parenthood and all things in between, it allows us to sympathise with him on another level and feel the weight of his actions as well as the consequences that surround him and having seen him grow from a baby in Rise, our emotional connection with him is already a strong one. Next, we have music. Absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack perfectly encapsulates the feeling of Planet of the Apes as a whole while also bringing it's own flair, making it feel perfect for THIS movie and the scenes that it is used in.
In summary, this is a really, really good film and you should watch it, but I promised I'd tell you my first experience with it and why it means so much to me; when I was 15 me, my dad and my stepmother were all supposed to go and see the film in the IMAX together, unfortunately my dad got ill and it was cancelled. A few days later, my step-mum was supposed to be taking me to the train station, to stay with my birth mother, but unbeknownst to me, she took me to see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, it wasn't in IMAX but I didn't care, I got to spend some extra quality time with my step-mum and watch a bada** film before I left and it's a memory that perseveres through the many that have faded.
I'm going to give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a 9/10. Thank you for reading this LONG review and have a lovely day or night, wherever you may be.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
161,p-jonsson,Not great but mildly entertaining,6,6 December 2014,"As a sci-fi fan this movie was one of those must-see movies for me. I have to say that I was not having the highest of expectations on it though and I also have to say that my expectations was more or less met. To me this is a mildly entertaining movie but it is certainly not a great movie.The special effects with the apes are very good indeed. The apes look very much real and I was surprised at how much emotions that the special effects people managed to get into their facial expressions. The human actors also did a quite good jobwithin the limitations of the script of course.However, the previous movie felt reasonably new, fresh and original (although it was fairly predictable) while this movie just feels like a rehash of some fairly standard, thirteen on a dozen, post-apocalyptic story with some apes thrown in to make it stand out. I really do not understand why so many people seems to think so highly of this movie. It is the all too common catalogue of stupid behaviors and sadly enough the apes seems to have inherited plenty of stupid behaviors from the humans.It starts of with the usual scared-trigger-happy-idiot-shoots someone. In this case an ape of course. How many times have that boring excuse for kick starting the story been used? Then it pretty much goes on. The only mildly intelligent people in the town seems to be the Malcolm and Dreyfus. The two morons wasting ammunition on firing at a old car and drinking Whisky as well as the original idiot who tried to hide a gun deserved to be shot.The only somewhat intelligent part was when the captured apes turned over a bus and took a bunch of their adversaries with them. The movie was indeed very predictable. The only thing that elevated the movie above the level of downright boring was the fact that half of the characters were apes and, luckily as I wrote, those special effects were very well done.The blurb from Twentieth Century Fox states that ""both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species."". Well yes I guess that you cannot say that this is a downright lie but it is definitely a bunch of hyperbole to sell the movie. Come on, we are talking about a very limited group of apes, badly decimated as well, against the rest of the surviving humanity, which obviously have some modern facilities left and a war that is more or less just assumed will happen.A mildly entertaining movie but certainly not a great movie.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
162,EthanBJones_03,Ape not kill Ape. Reeves Not Kill Franchise!,8,29 May 2017,"'DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' was directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke and Toby Kebbell. Over a decade after the simian flu wiped out most of the worlds humans, Caesar(Andy Serkis) and his band of apes have grown immensely and become much more intelligent. Meanwhile, Malcom(Jason Clarke) and a band of human survivors ask Caesar for help to help humans survive. This creates a rift between both the apes, the humans and the relationships between both. ​ Very few sequels improve upon the stepping stones left behind by their predecessor. Only rare occasions like with 'The Dark Knight', 'Terminator 2' and 'Fast Five' do we get sequels that are infinitely better than their already brilliant originals. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is one of these uncommon occasions. Sure it has its flaws(some of which do carry over from 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes') but it also fixes many and doubles the amount of drama and action that was there before. Pretty much everything is either improved or stays the same when compared to its predecessor. Nothing retraces its steps quality wise and that is very pleasing in today's movie climate.For example, the story in the original was very well written and I congratulated the writers for that. Building of the success of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', they could have just slapped a story together to string the events along but they don't and I genuinely admire that. They still put effort into the story and give it meaning and impact. The themes of betrayal and being a father carry over to here which was nice but I would have liked to see something new and different. The ending here, which I won't spoil, is also really good and perfectly sets up 'War For the Planet of the Apes'. Overall, they could have just made a weak story and ending just to hurry up the action but they don't and they genuinely try to deliver a pleasing narrative.Next, there is the acting. I've said it once, I'll say it again, Andy Serkis deserved some love from the Oscars for his mesmerising portrayal as Caesar and I honestly feel its disrespectful they haven't given him one yet. Toby Kebbell was also great as Koba and he has a clear arc from point A - B. All the non-human characters in the film were excellently acted and wrote and were the standouts of the film. That said, most of the human characters were very weak and their acting wasn't too special either. Jason Clarke, for starters, was very weak as Malcolm and showed no joy, sadness or anger at any point in the film. I feel like Gary Oldman at least tried as Dreyfus but that was no match for how poorly written the humans were. I will say that's the main flaw of most of the humans. Most of them were competently acted and whatnot but none of them had any interesting motives or personalities and were all forgettable. None of them were particularly likable and they were all replaceable, both as characters and actors. That said, both the villains were alright and, although one of them had a pretty weak arc for me, both of them were pretty threatening.Technically, this movie is flawless. The cinematography is gorgeous, the visual effects and mind blowing and even the costume/set design was brilliant. Matt Reeves is proving he's a world class director on a technical level and I am always amazed with the visually stunning work he pushes out.Now for the action... It's absolutely awesome! I thought it would be pretty hard to top the action in its predecessor but I was very wrong. I won't go into detail, because you really should see it for yourself, but I must describe ONE tiny segment of action that will have to make you see it. An ape... riding a horse... carrying an assault rifle... while jumping through flames. If that doesn't get you interested in this movie then I don't know what will. Aside from the action, this movie is also pretty damn spectacular on an emotional and dramatic level. This movie pulled at my heartstrings multiple times and must be commended for that. Colour me impressed. One thing I will say was pretty flawed about the movie was some of the dialogue which was unbelievably cliché and could be predicted from a mile away. I must of said what a character was gonna say before they said it like 20 or 30 times in the movie because it was pretty damn cliché.In Conclusion, this movie is dramatic, emotion, action packed, a visual treat and is well worth your time and money. 8/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

164,ericrnolan,"A quick review of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014)",9,22 July 2014,"I really liked it! It had a fun, cool depiction of ape culture, and a surprisingly awesome villain in the form of Koba. The great CGI and some terrific voice acting made both Koba and extremely likable Caesar seem real.The action and special effects delivered; this was a nice little darker action flick with a science fiction premise. Koba and the sometimes unsettling battle scenes made this something that would also please horror movie fans as well. The scene where Koba tricks the two men at target practice? Yeesh. Look at that sneer.We've got three cardboard good guys that make up a pretty boring de facto nuclear family. For a better example of how to script post- apocalyptic characters, the screenwriters ought to see ""28 Days Later"" and ""The Walking Dead."" Jason Clarke's Malcom was sooo nice and intuitively understanding, I kept hoping that one of the apes would knock him upside the head to slap some character depth into him. The far more interesting characters were Koba, Caesar, and Gary Oldman's Dreyfus.Question — does Kirk Acevedo play a jerk in everything that he's in? I am reaching for an ""Oz vs. Apes"" joke right now, but cannot seem to find it.Question — I am no techie, but would human survivors really need hydroelectricity just to power a long-range radio? Couldn't something like that be powered by a generator or some other power source?Anyway, this was a fun, darker sci-fi movie — I'd happily recommend it.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
165,James_De_Bello,8.5/10,8,26 September 2014,"8.5/10 I was expecting this movie to be good going in, but I really did not expect something of this caliber. This was a seriously amazing experience in the theater. Talking about positives I'll start with what everyone is raving about: Andy Serkis, and to an extent all of the motion capture acting. What can I possibly say that hasn't been already said by everybody? I mean this review could be only about praising Serkis' talent. He is the key to the success of the whole movie because through his touching, brilliant performance he builds the film's emotional core that is essential for the story to resonate. Scene after scene you simply can't take the eyes off him, you can feel his presence instantly and to this for sure contribute some of the best special effects the industry is able to produce nowadays. The apes simply look like they are there flesh-and-bone and there isn't even one shot I can think about that had bad or unfinished CGI. The rest of the cast is perfectly decent, the only that truly sticks out other than Serkis is clearly Toby Kebbel. Cinematography is utterly brilliant and the choice of shots is stunning: there are some uninterrupted shots that where truly breathtaking and contributed to the creation of suspense spectacularly. Giaccino too is in prime form and delivers a very engrossing score. Matt Reeves really knew what he was doing because, other than there being a great screenplay, the storytelling, the drama, the character coherence, everything flows in a natural and spontaneous way that honestly surprised me on how actually good it was. This movie has probably the best storytelling I have experienced this year. This is probably why there were three or four minor story moments that didn't fit 100% to me. In an average blockbuster I probably wouldn't have even thought of them, but here everything was running so amazingly smoothly that they really stuck even though they weren't actually so problematic. The action scenes were brilliant too because they were so key to the storytelling they never would force themselves in and because of that felt all the more riveting. I think that I was genuinely on the edge of my seat for a full hour. The pace of the movie was nearly perfect, I do think that if they had cut or edited in a different way just a couple of scenes they could have achieved pace perfection. Other than that I had a kind of problem for the first twenty minutes in get fully involved in some of the characters, I was never bored but it would felt emotionally uneven for a couple of scenes, yet it picked up almost immediately. On a minor note I did hear three or four clichéd lines here an there and again this speaks to the quality of the movie because they stuck out since everything around them was excellent. I am not yet sure if this movie deserves a 9 or not I guess time will tell. Anyways I loved this one a lot, it is in every way better than its predecessor, which was pretty dam good itself, and it is definitely one of the best movies I have seen this year so far.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
166,scottshak_111,"""The war has just begun.""",8,11 July 2014,"We saw the gradual development of a baby ape into an intelligent leader in Rise. In Dawn, we see him reign.Reeves offers us an insight, a glimpse about the impending chaos in a Simian afflicted world. He spends hours into character building, the crucial element to any flick, where a director makes you feel 'value' and 'importance' of every soul at large. With apes spending more time on screen than humans, the title of the flick justifies. There is Koba, the bad-ass scarred ape, who defies the leader of the herd with his differences and engenders villainy and exasperates chaos. Maurice, the lovely and loyal orangutan, is charming as ever, whilst Blue Eyes wears an apt role exhuming strong emotional vibes, his best part being: where Reeves uses his perceptive to show the ugly side of war, the absorption of the aftermath on a young amateur heart, the effects of violence, the dread, the fallen victims and the cadavers of the innocents. The war presentation was drenched in beauty.Caesar emanates pizazz. We see him develop into a more thoughtful and intelligent being. The maturity that adorns his countenance makes him stand out from the rest. His personality would put you in awe.The CGI is marvelous. It was thrilling to watch each and every Serkis emotion captured into a series of dark and grim frames impeccably. On the humans counter, we have Jason, Gary, Kodi and Keri in the driving seat as crucial elements trying to help their own species for survival, by gathering resources for sustenance. The fear in the eyes of Jason Clarke is natural and relatable, when he ventures himself into the ape territory. A strange blend of geniality and fear persists whenever he is around Caesar and he dons it brilliantly. If we take the downsides of the movie into account, we find a clichéd tale that has probably been narrated many times before in epic tragedies. There is no element of surprise in the flick. Nothing memorable to cherish too. Matt needs to take these factors into account, whilst directing the next sequel.But overlooking the above fact, we do have a brilliant moulding of a tale that is on its way to become an epic saga of Caesar, his scion Blue eyed wonder, probably the next possible leader, an ape family who is willing to follow the footsteps of its leader, extinction of humans and their gasp for survival in a Simian-ridden Earth and a fight for coexistence – nature's felony of keeping predators and preys in one basket.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
167,tankace,A mouth full of a title but great film none the lest.,8,20 July 2017,"Dawn takes place 10 years after the events of Rise and we see who the societies of both the Apes and the Human around the area of San Francisco live after most of humanity has vanished due to the event of the previous film.

However prejudice from both sides set the stage for the battle for supremacy. And what I like with these films is the the effects are here to help the story become real ,unlike with the Transformers in which the effects are in the spotlight and the story, characters, themes and good writing are left out, here is almost the reverse.To our main ape Ceasar, damn ,from pet to revolutionary to leader and father he has quit a life and in him we see the best of both world come together and make one of the best character of modern movie history. As for the humans ,you feel that they are desperate and in all honesty they lack the necessary skills in order to survive with out the comforts of heirs society before its collapse. Also we see that they have difficulty accepting that the apes next to them aren't just animals but intelligent beings with families of their own. From the apes point of view there are some of them who share ironically the same distrust with the human due to their previous treatment from them. In short who is to blame... both!In total a good and thoughtful look to the theme of distrust of ""the other"" and who our own faults blind us to see what is best for us.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
168,shawneofthedead,"A new dawn indeed - one that's bracing, smart, philosophical and explosive.",8,10 July 2014,"No one expected great things from RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, the 2011 reboot of a sci-fi franchise that nobody asked for. There just seems to be something faintly camp about its premise: a monkey acquires human intelligence - from James Franco, no less - and leads his simian brethren in a rebellion against mankind?!? And yet, surprising critics and audiences, RISE made its alternate universe terrifyingly, beautifully credible through its mix of sincere character work, lofty sci-fi and ground-breaking CGI. Miraculously, DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is even better - it blends even more stunning animation and heart- pounding action with huger ideas and bigger emotions, finding within its fiercely-fought battles the metaphor and menace of every conflict and war that has ever plagued mankind.A decade after Earth has been ravaged by the simian virus unleashed in RISE, Caesar (Serkis) has settled his well-evolved community of apes high atop a mountain. But, one day, their idyll is rudely interrupted by the arrival of a band of human survivors led by the kindly, open-minded Malcolm (Clarke). As it turns out, the apes have settled upon a non-functioning hydro-electric dam - the last chance a nearby human colony has of restoring its power supply for good. Caesar and Malcolm forge a tentative alliance - one that rests on a powder-keg of tension and mistrust. Dreyfus (Oldman) urges the human settlers to build up their stockpile of weapons in case they have to take the ape stronghold by force; while Koba (Kebbell) first tries to warn, before he tries to manipulate, his fellow apes against the human menace in their midst.DAWN carries over one element from its predecessor: the increasingly urgent identity crisis and soul-searching that come when man and ape try to figure out how to live with one another. What is humanity? And what is base, animalistic behaviour? Humans can make music, as we see in a heartrendingly sweet moment when the human survivors hear music again for the first time in years. But they also make weapons. The growth of understanding and respect between Caesar and Malcolm is balanced against the sheer hatred of humanity that runs through Koba in the film's second half, and the suspicions and doubt experienced by Caesar's own son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) about his father's 'human-loving tendencies'.All the more impressive is the fact that the film takes no sides: every character feels real, and even the antagonists have perfectly logical reasons for behaving in the way they do. As Koba regresses ever more into a spitting, irrational animal, we can never forget what he suffered at the hands of human scientists: the scars and anger he bears are the legacy of human neglect and cruelty. The same goes for Dreyfus: as he readies the humans for war, we're allowed a peek into the heart of the man when the return of electricity gives him glimpses of a past that he can never forget. In these moments of insight, the film goes from good to great.DAWN is also one of the finest movies made in recent memory that focuses so squarely on the outbreak and tragic inevitability of war. The film explores in intelligent, sensitive detail how conflicts can begin - and lays out in excruciating fashion how having right-minded individuals on both sides of a divide is no guarantee of peace. Director Matt Reeves handles the descent into battle beautifully: every step towards war is a small one, whether deliberate or unintentional, and builds to a crescendo of mutually-assured destruction. The parallels with real-world conflicts, from guerrilla warfare to nuclear destruction, are rife, and will strike you in ways you'd never expect from a sci-fi blockbuster about apes taking over the world.As for the outer trappings of the film, these are truly spectacular - the animation is astounding, especially considering that the motion- capture performed for many of the ape characters took place outside of a conventional studio setting. Soundtracked by Michael Giacchino's bitingly tense score, the action sequences are fantastic: they thrum with action and inventiveness, as the apes storm the human settlement, or tumble through the air in a storm of fire. The cast is uniformly excellent: Serkis, Kobbell and Thurston, in particular, are shrouded by CGI but nevertheless turn in performances bursting with spirit and soul. Clarke plays his one-note ""sensible, good man"" very well, and Keri Russell gets more to do as the medically-trained Ellie than most female leads in such blockbusters typically would.The question is whether audiences can buy completely into the universe created by the film. As was the case with RISE, Reeves and his entire cast and crew have committed wholly to this fiction: DAWN takes itself deadly seriously, never once winking at the audience in acknowledgement of its slightly campy premise. That is, arguably, necessary for the film to reach the heights that it does. If it weren't completely earnest, DAWN's emotional moments - of which there are many - would not be as successful, or as well-earned.However, viewers who remain detached from it all would find it easier to spot the film's draggier moments, or to take note of its odd collapsing of time when the apes attack the human colony. They might also sorely feel the lack of levity in the film; there's only a brief moment of comic clowning by Koba which, unfortunately, shades very quickly into horror and tragedy. Nevertheless, it's hard to deny that DAWN is a powerful, thought- provoking entry into the Apes canon. In making a war between man and ape so chillingly plausible, it easily becomes one of the boldest, darkest and smartest sci-fi films yet to be constructed on a possibly rather hokey premise. Best of all, whether you're here for its philosophy or its explosions, DAWN pays off in spades: giving you plenty to think about even as it teases, pleases and confounds your senses.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
169,jawneyfloros,a sequel that is almost as good as the first movie,9,16 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that humans can be just as cruel to their animal relatives as to other humans. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good. The cinematography is really good but the CGI really pisses me off for the most part except for Andy Serkis as the lead Ape Caesar because he proves that even in a motion caption suit on a green screen he can still give an Oscar worthy performance as a leader. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
170,gavinp9,"Talking-monkey-riding-a-horse-shooting-a-gun: sounds ridiculous & stupid, but once you see how it fits into this film, you'll see how cool and relevant it is!",8,2 January 2018,"'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' does a great job of continuing the story from 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', without picking up directly where it ended or doing any gimmicky flashbacks. The graphic of how the simian virus spread was quite original and the opening shot of Caesar - and indeed the first 15min or so - does a great job of showing so much, without needing any talking.The setting is still Muir Woods in San Francisco, but a lot has changed, with the apes now living peacefully and successfully in the forest and the humans a desperate mess in the city. I was amazed by how quickly I was cheering for the apes and, if not despising, then at least not caring for the humans at all! Caesar (Serkis), Koba (Kebbell), Blue Eyes (Thurston) & Maurice (Konoval) are the main stars here, with Dreyfus (Oldman), Malcolm (Clarke) & Ellie (Russell) merely making up the numbers. It's great to have Serkis back as Caesar, the ""king of the Apes"", with such nuanced and believable body language and facial expressions. Hard to believe he has gone from obscurity to the world's greatest motion-capture actor in just over 10 years! He's now responsible for three of the biggest characters of all time - Caesar, King Kong & Gollum - and he'll be in 'Star Wars: Episode VII' next year!So much happens in this film - it's tense and dramatic in parts, then a full blown war in others and a political tug-of-war in others, and often times both ""sides"" are trying hard to do right, but something prevents that. It's definitely not boring and flies along, looking great, and importantly too - sounding great, with a nice score underneath and throughout.Seeing as this is the seventh film in the franchise (no one counts Burton's 2001 remake, right?), it definitely leaves you wondering and anticipating what will happen in the third of the ""prequel trilogy"" and see how they link them to the original 60s/70s films. It will also be amazing if they have the third prequel made by 2016, considering how much CGI & motion-capture detail they will need for the epic 'conclusion'...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
171,doug_park2001,"""I see now how much like them we are""",8,15 July 2014,"After experiments on chimpanzees infected with the mind-enhancing Simian Flu virus go awry, the chimps escape and the backfiring virus decimates most of the human population. Complete background is available at planetoftheapes.wikia.com: It might be helpful to look over this site before seeing the movie, especially if you're like me and haven't seen the earlier RISE Of The PLANET Of The APES. The chimps, along with gorillas and orangutans--also subjects of experiments or possibly liberated from the zoos?--develop a rudimentary civilization of their own, hunting with spears and arrows and riding horseback. Small contingents of humanity survive, however, and soon a band of apes in the forests near what's left of San Francisco encounters a hold-out of these survivors. There are some attempts to peacefully coexist, but . . .DAWN of the PLANET of the APES (""DPA"") is a fun, enthralling, and carefully filmed prequel that does a nice job of showing the back-story of the earlier ""Planet of the Apes"" films of the '70s. It begins as a thoughtful science fiction drama, gradually descending into more of a fast action-driven thriller. Still, I'm sure a thriller is what most people are after here, and I'm not sure how it could have gone any other way. Even in the violent latter portions, there are some touching moments and interesting turnabouts, with excellent special effects throughout.There are all kinds of potential themes and parallels in this film. The dual dove/hawk power struggles between the competing chimp alpha males--pragmatic and basically peaceful Caesar versus embittered Koba--and two human alpha males--conciliatory architect Malcolm versus the more bellicose former Chief of Police Dreyfus--are especially interesting and do much to support the story. As in the earlier films, some may find the apes a bit over-idealized with all their noble ""Ape not kill ape!"" business. Chimps can be quite vicious and are often cannibalistic: Apparently they're supposed to have evolved beyond that here (even though they obviously haven't completely). A few more choice minutes toward the beginning on how the ape society develops, particularly in how the orangutans and gorillas, who take a vague cheap seat to the more numerous and practical-minded chimps, are supposed to fit in would have been a plus. There's one gibbon or monkey sentry shown early-on, but s/he's apparently a loner. Yep, a more diverse ape society would have been great, but I guess you can't expect everything. While it can be fun to analyze and interpret DPA, too much of this is likely to ruin a film that's intended mainly as simple entertainment.All that being said, there's some interesting character development in DPA: Caesar and Koba are particularly fascinating even though the former seems more like a man in a chimp's body than an evolved chimp. Perhaps that's the point: For better or worse, brilliant Caesar was more responsive to the early experiments and became ""more like us."" Still, why oh why does he speak English even to his fellow chimps? Nevertheless, Andy Serkis does a magnificent job with the voice, the motions, and everything else he was given in portraying Caesar. The costume design is more problematic. The primary chimps, along with the cute babies (actual chimps?) look quite real, but many of their supporters are less so. While the orangs and gorillas look real, they are a bit bigger-than-life. The humans all look amazingly clean and well-groomed considering the conditions under which they've been living. Still, the human acting is generally good, with some fairly memorable performances by Jason Clarke as Malcolm, Keri Russell as his nurse-wife Ellie, and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Malcolm's son, Alexander.For all its kinks, DPA does an admirable job of showing some truly fantastic situations in the most convincing manner possible, and I'm sure anyone who's enjoyed the other ""Planet of the Apes"" films will like this one.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
172,TheMarwood,"Very well made, but not without its problems",5,13 July 2014,"Visually this eclipses its predecessor on every technical level. The motion capture and rendering of the apes are simply wonders of vfx and the environment work of nature reclaiming San Francisco is very well done. The effects don't really feel like effects, which is the highest compliment I could give an effects driven film. The apes are believable and never for a second do I feel like I'm viewing pixels. The premise of the film is unconvincing at best and the series of events that lead to all out war are based on flimsy gaps of logic. The humans who occupy San Francisco are running low on fuel for energy and a dam that could provide an alternate source of energy is in ape territory and the humans will lay to waste any ape in the way of that dam if need be. No solar panels in San Fran? Wind energy? The screenplay just needs a connect the dot plot point to introduce tension. The humans barely register as a presence and we get simple variations of good and bad characters. If Andy Serkis did motion capture for CG humans, he probably would have been more compelling than the black void Jason Clarke and Keri Russel leave on screen. As Ape society begins to crumble when the threat of the human element is introduced, we get the soon to be villainous Koba, who's intentions are telegraphed the moment we first see his short fuse. Even though the ape material isn't the most compelling stuff, it's still far more fascinating to watch than any of the human scenes. Though another connect the dot plot point is introduced with an assassination attempt on Caesar, that somehow no ape seems to witness - which lazily sets up the entire last act. The effects are fantastic and the money spent is on the screen, so while the film is riddled with narrative issues, it's still worth a view for those qualities.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

An epic tale of the battle between man and the apes they have abused for so long. I got definite white man versus the Red Indian vibes from this film, and in a way the situation is very similar. In both the Ape population and the race of Man there are those who only see bad in their opposites and there are those who can see beyond the stereotype they believe them to be. Man as always, has that arrogance which makes them think they are the superior beings, but this film pushes you to think twice about that. A little odd, I must say to hear the Apes talking, more odd to see them riding horses. The Planet of the Apes Films of old featured humans dressed as Apes, with this production we had Apes looking like Apes in the correct proportions and somehow that made them more fearsome. There were however, moments of extreme tenderness reminding us that these were just beings, trying to raise their families as the humans were. A solid performance from Gary Oldman, he can do no wrong whether he plays good guy or bad guy, any addition of him to a film is alright in my book. I watched this in 3D......pretty darn good!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
175,kermitkid,"Eat your heart out, Star Wars",10,30 March 2020,"Finally! A prequel done right! Rise of the Planet of the Apes was great, but this is better than it in every way! The great thing about this movie is that it's not very clear who's good and who's bad. Both sides have good people and apes and bad people and apes. The documentary feel of this movie also helps instill emotions that would have otherwise not have been had this been filmed in a traditional way. See this is 3D if you can because the depth and detail make you feel you are right there with the humans fighting the war against the apes, and once you see the apes' side you feel as of you are right there quietly observing. When a human looks down the sight of his rifle, you feel you are that human about to shoot the ape. The great thing is that even if you haven't seen the previous installment ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" you can still understand this perfectly. The first 20 minutes are apes doing sign language with subtitles on the bottom of the screen but you can still understand even without them. This film conveys human emotion really well, and the score is breathtaking. If the Academy doesn't nominate this for best score I will never forgive them. Listen to it on a surround sound system, and just let it sweep over you.

They totally encompassed the feel of the jungle and what it felt like to be in an ape's home. The action was well done too, but I had problems with it because it was too violent. Plus, the apes seemed to know how to handle guns a bit too well.The main problem I had with it that's just like a pet peeve, is that the apes were riding on horses. Out of nowhere they had horses at their beck and call. I just can't get over that.The facial expressions on the apes though, really conveyed their emotions. Even though they all generally look the same, with the expressions, you could tell what was going on behind each of them. For example with Caesar's son, you could really see the innocence on his face.Also, the relationships between the humans, apes, and human and ape had some good depth in it. It really conveyed how there should not be 'in- groups' and 'out-groups', because there will always be exceptions. That I give a thumbs up to.Lastly, the ending. It felt like it just cut short and ended with no point whatsoever. Like the whole movie was to prevent this one thing and then in the end, it's just like f- this.

Actors like Andy Serkis (Caesar) and Toby Kebbell (Koba) are commendable in their ape characters.

179,trublu215,A top notch summer blockbuster,8,20 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an intelligent, beautifully crafted sci-fi film featuring some of the best CGI work since Avatar. With 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the bar was set high for Dawn and it definitely meets the criteria for not only a sequel but a great summer film. Set years after the events of Rise, Earth is overrun by the apes and the humans are almost extinct. When a group of humans stumble into ape territory, it is a battle between humans and apes as they are led into war for all the wrong reasons. This film works well as we try and understand Caeser as well as the humans. While it is easier for the audience to relate to the human motives throughout the film, it does a great job of showing the ape's side of things, almost to a fault. Director Matt Reeves spends much time with Caeser and the apes, showing that there are two sides to every war. While this remains fascinating throughout the film and holds your attention, you do start to feel fatigued by the idea after the first half of the film. By then you're wishing for further character development with the humans that simply never arrives. The lead actors, Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke and Kerri Russell are all very good in this. But the standout here is Andy Serkis as Caeser. Serkis brings a human element to a clear cut animal and makes it impossible for you not to fall in love with his character and truly care about him. It is a very layered and auteur performance. Director Matt Reeves proves that he is a forced to be reckoned with here. The action sequences are well constructed, the cinematography is top notch, and the overall storytelling works. Overall, this is one hell of a summer movie that really gets your blood pumping. It is smart, funny, action packed and thrilling...all the ingredients for a fantastic film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

A director I wish we saw more films from. He's terrific. This is an action film with some actual substance, it's an actual movie with emotions and feelings. You care about the characters. It's not just every other action film out there which is a mass produced fast food product. This film and The Batman- Dark Knight Series by Christopher Nolan are the only action films that are really great. Every other action film out there pretty much is pure garbage, pure fast food. Andy Serkis is so good too. I would love to see him in a role without his prosthetic make-up or without him doing a voice over that shows his true talents. Any film I ever see with Andy Serkis where he's just Andy Serkis in the flesh never really shows his true talents such as films like this one or Lord of the Rings. It's kind of shame, he's a great actor. This is a great movie and one should absolutely see this one, you won't be disappointed.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
181,Jerghal,"Classic story, great CGI apes",8,6 November 2014,"Dawn takes place 10 years after the first film. Mankind is almost wiped out. A human survivor settlement wants to restore a power dam which happens to be also the home and settlement of the apes. The story really is a rather classic one, something we surely all seen before. The biggest draw for this film is the execution. And more specifically the performance of the apes: they squeeze more emotion out of these computer generated monkeys than Keanu Reeves ever showed in his whole career. They also look quite real and convincing. The animation is superb and the rendering almost photo-real. Despite all this praise I think it is a bit overrated. 8,0/10 by 140.000 people on IMDb should warrant an instant classic but for me it's not. I liked it, it's better than the first one, much better than 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes' but it lacked something to make it to my personal favorites list. But don't let that keep you from checking it out.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
182,martinrobertson300482,Has to be seen to be believed!!,10,25 July 2014,"Ever since ""Rise of the Planet of the apes"" was advertised, I've loved the direction this ""old worn out"" franchise is taking, and it seems a lot of other people are now on-board too. I mean, with the exception of ""Batman,"" what other franchise that's been ""rebooted"" was actually in dire need of it, and has actually pulled it off in a totally new, creative and original way? To get straight to the point. ""Dawn of the Planet of the apes"" is what ""The Dark Knight"" was to ""Batman begins."" In that its successful in living up to the impossible expectations set-up after the surprise praise put upon number 1. If not completely surpassing those expectations.What worked for the best in ""rise"" is built upon with this one. Yes, Ceaser, the leader of all of these super intelligent apes is still the star of the show, brought to life with amazing motion capture CGI, and the under-praised actions of Andy Serkis. But what's going on around him is equally amazing. With the entire films special effects being at their best.There's a lot more use for the other apes this time as well, with the people behind their actions making some of the other characters equally as compelling As Caeser. But its still the story that comes first, and the film is made all the stronger for it. In the old movies you had to sustain disbelief a lot when it was just guys in rubber suits playing the apes, but here, you believe these characters are real when they act like apes, and completely forget your watching an animated animal when these guys are talking.The First movie had a couple of daft bits, but this one (surprising as it sounds) feels completely believable and not stupid at all. Its stories great and unpredictable, its effects are amazing, there's heartfelt moments, exciting moments,creepy moments,and even a few funny ones. With the whole thing being brought to life with modern, unique computer altered performances, that have to be seen to be believed.Maybe i'm being to generous, but I really can't praise this movie enough. Too call it a great sequel is un-fair because its more than that, and is possibly the first film i've seen in years that I may even add to my ""All time favourites."" But is that all that surprising when ""Dawn"" is so damn near flawless.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
183,ghost_dog86,"Apes with guns, riding horses!",9,15 July 2014,"I knew this movie was going to be something special after the first 10 minutes came and went without the appearance of a single human and all I could think about was how so emotionally taken I was with watching Caesar's ape community interact with one another (mostly through sign language) that I could've sat through an entire feature length film with no human interference at all.Synopsis: Somewhere around 10 years after the results of the previous film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) caused the supposed mass extinction of all humans, a group of surviving apes and their offspring (lead by Caesar) have built a community on some of the nicer real estate in post-apocalyptic San Francisco. And then humans come and mess everything up.""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is full of ""WOW"" moments. By this I mean, I was so blown away with how the script (full of fabulously crafted Shakespearian themes) came together so wonderfully with a healthy portion of visuals punctuated by CGI textures and visceral direction from Matt Reeves (Let Me In) that I literally uttered the word ""WOW"", out loud at least a dozen times throughout my viewing experience.The Direction: When I think back on the history of primates in film, the difficulty directors tend to have (on a technical level) with portraying such an undeniably intimidating animal such as a gorilla or a chimpanzee in a manner that is even the slightest bit intimidating, has always been baffling to me. For this reason above all, I must heap praise onto Matt Reeves. There were moments when watching ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" when I got the same uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, as I had the last time I stood in front of the gorilla sanctuary at the zoo and realized that if I were any closer I could be ripped to shreds on a whim. I can guarantee I've never had this same experience watching any other cinematic primate.The Acting: From the trailers alone ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" would seem as though it stars the likes of Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Andy Serkis. But in reality, it stars Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell who play the two prominent lead ape characters, Caesar and Koba respectively; both giving nomination worthy performances. Every other actor portraying a non-ape character is aggressively secondary to the plot and should be considered as part of the supporting cast in a movie that didn't necessarily need a supporting human cast.If you've read my reviews before, you know that I'm a glass half empty kinda guy; a constant ""hater"". Or so they say. So, allow me to get off of this film's jock for a second and address a few things. If there are flaws in this sequel, they are minute; buuuuuuutthere are a few. The first being the miraculous resurrection sequence of a major character (that's about all I can say about that, without spoiling anything) which garnered audible groans from a few in the audience I sat with. The second flaw comes near the end by way of a 3 minute, woefully sappy, end of ""Rocky 4"", ""if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change""-esque back and forth between two characters. That said, there is way too much here to admire (the storytelling, the performances, the action sequences, etc.) to make a big deal out of forgettable ""flaws"" such as those. Somoving on.Final Thought: If I sat most teenagers down in front of the 1968 classic, ""Planet of the Apes"", it wouldn't take long for them to openly disregard the fantastic premise, underlying themes of racism and a delightfully dark ending that most big budget films nowadays couldn't possibly get away with, simply because the look is very dated and the camp factor is very 60's centric. With 2001's Tim Burton remake, we saw an instance of millions of dollars thrown into a production, with the end result being a film that is still panned across the board, to this day. But with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (directed by Rupert Wyatt) and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", what we are witnessing is this same (if not similar) premise, based on the ridiculous notion that apes can now speak, but this time it's done in such a way that not for one moment during either of these films (both of which apes speak, and one of which apes ride horses and shoot firearms) are things perceived as campy or unintentionally silly. That is the reason why these new Planet of the Apes remakes work. It's not so much the million dollar visual effects or the overall entertainment factor. It's the fact that a packed theater, filled with people from all walks of life, sat and watched a two hour movie where apes talk, and not one of them snickered.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
184,galahad58-1,Monkey Around,7,20 July 2014,"I am going to give you the good, the bad and the ugly from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.The good: the CG effects are fantastic. The apes look great and the expressions (eyes, emotions, etc.) are wonderful. The landscape looks great and the film presents a believable post-apocalyptic world. Caesar is well represented and is a great central character to the film. The bad: cliché after cliché after cliché. It is tiring that movies use the same plot lines and the same types of situations time and time again. This screen writing by numbers has gotten so old and is a sign that there is a lack of intelligent writers in the entertainment industry. It is stupid that a society (apes) would allow one racial bigot to manipulate the entire community to violence when the community is taught not to act that way. It takes away from the storyline in which the director wants you to care about the apes, but they are the ONLY ones who exhibit the violent, aggressive attitude and kill indiscriminately. The apes are the aggressors in this movie and it would suggest that intelligent beings are manipulated by one individual to go on killing sprees. The ugly: the movie tries, at the end, to make a bad guy out of Gary Oldman. The problem is that he does nothing sinister, or evil, the entire film and just because he wants to demolish the tower (that the apes took over) because the apes attacked them without provocation and killed many, many humans does not make him bad. If his character were in any other movie, he would have been a hero. The fact that Malcolm feels for the apes, and yes you may say that Caesar was the reason for that, after they destroyed his entire home and killed a large majority of human beings is a bit over the top. The film started out as an interesting character study and could have pursued more with the apes/human interaction. Instead of going along an intelligent pathway, it instantly turns into a mindless slaughter spree to have the action component at the expense of storyline and believability.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (DPA) is absolutely epic.Characters - The characters in this movie were great. Andy Serkis was incredible like usual and all the other actors in the movie were great too. Jason Clarke played well as the main human. I would prefer Franco more but Clarke was really good making out his characters. And every single ape I. This movie were awesome. I actually liked he character Blue Eyes who is Saesar's son. He was a great addition to the movie. And I really liked Koba the scary looking monkey he was a big part of the movie. Gary Oldman of course acted well like always and he actually played as more of a good guy. At first I thought his character was going to be kind of a bad guy from the trailer but he turned out to be the good guy.Story/Plot - This movies story and plot is so well created. The movie has a perfect length. The 2 hours and 10 minutes was literally e perfect amount of screen time for this movie it wasn't to short it wasn't to long. The plot totally surprises you. I thought this movie was going to go in a while another direction b actually went in a way that was unique and well played out. The movies story and plot works out great and the whole movies just makes you feel pumped and excited.Action Sequences - The action in this movie is great. I was a bit disappointed when Rise of the Planet of the Apes had little action just at the very end so I was happy to seen that this movie had a ton of awesome action. The ends action sequences are absolutely awesome. So the action in this movie is so well executed and I think the action is just pure epic. Just pure epic.Pros -Perfect Movie Time Length Epic Action Squences Well Created Plot and Story Superb Acting Incredibly Entertaining (No Boring Moments) Great Character DevelopmentOverall - So overall DPA is entertaining as heck and is my favorite Live-Action movie so far this year 2014.

Not really what I would call a smart tactical decision 2:As for Caesar why have koba walking around second guessing every thing you do.Even a chimp would know that could lead to disaster. These two, Koba and guy that hates apes ,are the spark of the whole conflict between humans and apes. Which again makes the whole movie very predictable, from the first 15 minutes you know how the whole thing will go, you only left guessing who will set off the powder keg.3:Another plot hole is why do they need the electricity back? They talk about a radio, but a short wave radio don't really use that much power, and you don't ever get to see what they need the electricity for. The chance of them getting anything else to work is pretty slim. It's not like you can just start up the power plant, and voila you have microwave dinner.

And somehow the dimwits human in this movie, don't convince me as someone who possesses that knowledge 4 where did all these apes come from ?? I mean even if they released all the test subjects in U.S how did they get to San Francisco? And do they multiply like rabbits? Cause there must have been over 1000 apes Another thing is: Why do Hollywood producers just seem to love big battle scenes were people get slaughtered in mass as they charge on through the bullets.. Have they sat through so many glorifying tales of the civil war, listening to historians telling how the brave brave soldiers continue to march on towards the on going bullet storm? And how come they always miss the leader in these big battles they are so found of , even though he never hides, they still can't hit him until the end.

First and foremost, the visuals. As expected, the film is stunning, but unlike most CGI heavy films of late, this one uses CGI the way it should be used, and that is mixed in with real, detailed sets and real locales. The creative team behind the Lord of the Rings films had a hand in this film and it shows. The apes are light years beyond what they looked like in Rise and I can't believe how much technology improved in three years. Never have so many mo-capped actors appeared on the screen at the same time, and not against blue-screen, but real, detailed sets, riding real horses and holding real weapons. It was mind-blowing.Ground breaking visuals aside, I thought the script was solid. Like the first film, it was a character drama that focuses on themes such as Loyalty, (or a lack thereof) Jealousy, Pride, Greed, and most of all, our savage nature. In the film Caesar says-- ""We apes are no less violent than humans"" and what that translates to is that we are no less violent than apes"" Matt Reeves did an great job with the direction of this film in that it has its own unique flair to it. He really gave it a Kubrick stamp. The pacing was okay, and he excels at using depth of field photography.. Some of the scenes were hauntingly beautiful to look at. However, I am left hoping for a directors cut in the future because the beginning felt rushed. I like my drama to build up slowly and this film cut right to the chase--which isn't what I wanted. I also thought some of the philosophy of this film differed from what the original Apes films spoke about--which was--humans are destructive, and so is their technology. All humans should be treated like the animals that they are. In Dawn, Caesar isn't as cynical as he was in the first film and it makes me wonder if his legacy will hold in the future apes films, when the ape eventually take Earth and view the humans as devilish animals. Overall, Dawn is bigger and better, and the soundtrack by the great Michael Giaccino was absolutely brilliant. It was perfect for this film. If a CG character is ever going to win an Oscar for best actor, it has to be Andy Serkis for his role as Caesar, the primate king!I'd go as far as considering this a masterpiece, but it felt more like a 2nd act rather than a film with a beginning, middle and an end. There was a bit of a cliffhanger in there, but it didn't totally leave me hanging in the end because the character driven elements were satisfying, but the entire plot as a whole will continue into the next film. Oh and don't forget to bring the tissues!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
190,Christopher_Reid,"Amazing ape performances, some stupid humans though",8,12 February 2016,"Dawn follows on 10 years after Rise. A large part of humanity has been killed by a deadly virus which swept the globe and Caesar and his ape community live somewhere in San Francisco. The apes teach each-other to read and write and most are fluent in sign language. They hunt other animals en masse with well-timed plans. Meanwhile, the humans are in a dystopian society, hanging around in an enclosure with limited electricity and no communications with humans in other areas. In fact, their power supply will run out in a few weeks unless they can reactivate a dam near where the apes are located.A mishap occurs where an ape ends up dead (due to a guy called Carver) and Caesar confronts the humans with his army warning that they should never again go into ape territory. It's a powerful and convincing moment.I've never hated a character more than I hated Carver (Kirk Acevedo) in this movie. He is loud, stupid, arrogant, rude, aggressive, dismissive of anything he doesn't agree with and almost single- handedly causes a war between apes and humans. He's antogonistic with the other humans and adds nothing of value to the movie. He cuts off Ellie (Keri Russell), emphatically proclaiming that obviously the apes are responsible for the simian virus (he is incorrect). I can't stand when movies turn to devices like this. It's unnecessary and cheapens the existing tension in the film. The other humans are stupid by extension by putting up with him and seemingly forgiving his countless mistakes, constant risk-taking and unpleasant negativity.The apes themselves represent a major achievement in film-making. The cgi is incredible although the chimpanzee faces are more obviously fake. The orangutans are especially unbelievable. I was really blown away. It's important to give credit to the sound design as well. The sounds give the apes weight and presence. You don't think about the breathing or the steps or the subtle shifting of weight but they all make noise which is critical to making it seem real.And the ape performances are great. The eyes of the apes are intense and knowing. Their movement is very natural, both with the body and the face. They put so much expression into what they say with sign language and also when they actually speak. Andy Serkis is the go-to man when it comes to ping-pong-balls-on-a-green-suit acting and he must have delivered here because Caesar is a powerful character with a demanding presence. Koba is also excellent but then so are all the apes. They're incredible to watch and ironically bring a lot of humanity to the movie, moreso than the humans.The way Koba eventually leads a battle against the humans is very logical and devious. I felt like it echoed WWI in some ways. But there are many gaps in logic in the movie. The humans are far too lazy in protecting a weapons depot. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) does a reasonable job of trying to connect with Caesar and the apes but he fails to warn that the humans are arming and preparing for a likely battle. He doesn't do enough to initiate diplomacy and communication between the apes and humans. Why aren't the humans more excited in finding intelligent, speaking apes? This is a major revelation! A chance to connect with a separate species.Gary Oldman is one of my favourite actors but he can only do so much with so little screen time and such weak lines. His character ends up being disappointingly short-sighted.The music was disappointing. Parts of it sounded like Agent Cody Banks or something - like a goofy kid's spy movie. Michael Giacchino seems inconsistent, perhaps it depends on the director or kind of movie he's working on. Some of the more sentimental parts were okay but most of the music sounded tired, contrived and forgettable.In summary, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a mixed bag. It has the makings of a great film with the potential to give profound insights into how conflicts grow and wars begin. Caesar's growing moral compass is powerful to watch. The apes make the movie worth seeing alone. But the humans are dull and stupid by comparison. The acting, lines and characterisation is weak for the humans. The action scenes are really well done. The relationship between Caesar and Koba is perhaps the core of the movie and it's very well done. Take out 40 minutes of weaker material and substitute 20 minutes of smart ideas and motivations and Dawn would be a masterpiece.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
191,Jared_Andrews,a smart epic,8,15 November 2014,"The reboot of the Planet of the Apes series is a true anomaly—each movie remake is better than its original. Clever casting and descriptive storytelling has helped turn the franchise into a smashing success. Just as James Franco delivered in 'Rise,' Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke did here in 'Dawn.' Also, and I was floored by this, Andy Serkis, playing a cgi ape, was brilliant. Ceasar is the defining character of the series, and Serkis has portrayed him beautifully. Everything that is Ceasar from the dominant body posture, to the startlingly authoritative voice is all perfectly on display thanks to the flawless work of Serkis. The fact that an ape, Ceasar, is by far the most complicated and intriguing character in the movie is no accident. Clearly the movie makers are sending a message, but more on that later. Ceasar is the ultimate leader prototype. He is wise, powerful, caring, and most importantly he is open to new ideas. Ceasar learns apes are not necessarily better than humans, nor are humans better than apes. There is good and bad in both. In the climactic scene *SPOILER ALERT* Ceasar says to Koba, ""you are not (an) ape."" If given a little thought, on realizes that this is an astoundingly profound statement coming from an ape. *END SPOILER* Ceasar is alluding to the idea of what it means to be humane, which can apply to both humans and apes. Some humans commit horrible atrocities that we consider inhumane, suggesting that these individuals are different and perhaps not human. The same could be said about certain apes—perhaps they are not worthy of being regarded as apes. While Ceasar towers above the rest, plenty of other characters were worth analyzing: Dryefus (Oldman), Malcolm (Clarke), and Koba (Kebbell). They, along with Ceasar, were all faced with the same dilemma—how to deal with the coexistence of apes and humans—but they each approached the situation very differently because of their individual backgrounds. Dreyfus wanted to fight and eliminate the apes. His military background caused him to think of the apes as a threat that should be dealt with. Similarly, he had a very narrow, simplistic view on every situation in the story. Plus, he almost ruined the entire movie with the most pompous statement anyone has uttered since the heyday of Muhammad Ali. Malcolm, a more peaceful, community-based thinker, saw the possibility of apes and humans cooperating. Koba had built up a massive distrust and even a hatred for humans because he was tortured in labs most of his life. So he immediately wanted to kill all the humans since he viewed them all as evil. Ceasar had the most complicated perspective because he was willing to accept new information and allow his viewpoint to evolve. He initially had ambivalent thoughts about humans due to varying experiences. Ceasar was loved by his human caretaker as a young ape, but mistreated and attacked by humans later in life. Based on his experience, he formed the opinion that apes were better and more evolved than humans. After seeing the events that unfolded during the movie, he realized neither species is inherently better. Clearly there are parallels between the pairs of humans and apes. The writers are sending the message that the two sides are very similar (although, Ceasar is made to be the most impressive character just to push the point that apes are not to be held beneath humans), each capable of both great compassion and destruction. The bells of racial overtones ring loud and clear, just as they did in the original 'Apes' film. Some want to fight, some want to segregate, some want to cooperate. It should sound familiar. In addition, the writers deserve credit for setting the table for a war between the species without bluntly presenting who is responsible for its commencement. Both sides played their part. The lines of good and bad are blurred. Fear (which led to hate) seems to be the only true enemy. One thing that was made obvious is that an epic battle is looming in the sequel. And if the quality of 'Dawn' is an indication, it is going to be epic.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
192,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Dawn of the Fantastic Man vs Wild Cinema!!,8,21 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. There is a ape in every human and there is a human in every ape. This line describes the whole idea behind consistently engaging and imaginative sequel to the well respected Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Taking a jump of 10 years from the last movie, dawn is about the survival of the fittest among apes and humans. Caesar, the amazing creation of combination of acting skills of Andy Serkis and new age motion capture technology is the heart of the story. He leads, and bleeds for the apes. Apes have become almost human. They have families, the conflicts, the trust issues with humans and the rules to govern their wild colony. These tiny details make Dawn a unique piece of cinema. All jungle scenes are done so well that they make real footage of National Geographic seem ordinary. All apes and humans characters make you root for them even the evil ones. Caesar's elder son's emotional journey is soothing and his younger's son's first encounter with humans is heart warming. At the same time, ape Koba's encounter with two humans guarding the weapons and his ever rising conflict with Caesar is chilling.For nitpicking, apes riding horses seems somewhat hard to believe and 3D does not add any value in the story telling apart from the massive destruction scene in the climax. Running for more than 2 hours, dawn is a high voltage action and fiction drama that leaves you amazed. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. It is the most sure footed blockbuster of Hollywood this year so far. Don't miss it!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
193,d_m_s,Yawn of the planet of the apes,1,24 July 2014,"After watching the 'not too bad' Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the 8.3 out of 10 rating is what made me think this film might be worth going to see at the cinema. I mean, if it was a bad film it couldn't get such a high rating, right? Well God knows who on earth is giving this such a high rating because it is a very poor film, even with my low expectations after the first film, which was mediocre (but a lot better than Dawn).In Dawn, humans have mostly died out. Then some humans (who were apparently living in their hundreds just down the road from the apes, despite the apes claiming they haven't seen a human in over 2 years) stumble upon the apes' den in the forest. The humans want access to the dam that the apes have built their home around.There are some good humans and some bad. There are some good apes and some bad. There is some betrayals and then war breaks out. It's all very, very, VERY predictable and we've seen it all before many, many times. There really is nothing new or interesting here. I mean, yeah OK it's an old 'one side against the other' story but Jesus man, if you want to keep the audience interested you've got to do something a little different! Every element of this film, including the subplots, have all been done before and it has taken no talent to write this story. All of the characters are bland and I really just wanted all the humans shot, good or bad, so that I wouldn't have to suffer their inane conversations.I had to give this a 1 because it was so dull, so pointless, so unoriginal, so bland and a total waste of time.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
194,shoobe01-1,Humans (in this film) deserved to die,6,10 August 2019,"The human colony was distractingly stupid. The people made comical decisions all along. Stereotypical rednecks abound, and terrible decisions by people who clearly were political and intelligent enough to get the whole thing organized. So bad, I fell between not caring about the human side, and actively being happy when they got murdered.Ape side of the story was solid, much better acted, and so on. Worked great. In between were the humans who did the primary interaction with the ape society. Sometimes shockingly stupid, but on average okay.Overall story is fine, but too much dumbness for physics and geography. Not sure why the citadel is fake, why they had to mess with where things are in city of SF, why they had to add a fake dam in the North Bay somewhere ill defined, etc. So much to work with there, they could have done better. Also: radios don't take that much power. Battery + solar would be enough to talk to those they do to set up the plot for the next movie, and gensets? Easy. Etc. for other solutions. I need explanations of why wood gasification won't work, how they fuel the vehicles, where the food comes from, or the water, or... anything?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
195,kunalkhandwala,Serkis' performance and WETA Tech are EPIC!,8,2 August 2014,"A calculative and decisive group of apes waits patiently for their leader's signal to attack a herd of deer. In true predator style, these fearsome apes swing through the trees in the Muir forest while some even encounter an angry bear. Back in their forest lair, Caesar learns of his newborn son and cherishes a life that they have managed to sustain as a group but is wary of any potential threat to their home. Director Matt Reeves ('Cloverfield') shifts focus to the phenomenal development of the apes as the hyper-intelligent surviving species on the planet, leaving the remaining humans to blandness. It is quite an achievement however, to engage the audience with apes that speak and delineate emotions rather than humans, when they are in conflict. The credit for this goes to the performance-capture technology and its shining beacon – Andy Serkis. After their 'Rise' in the previous story, the apes face an uncertain future on a planet that has been dominated by a now hostile species. In Caesar though, they have a leader who will bring a new 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' but he must first establish order and defend his family against adversaries both within their sanctum and out there in the city. It has been 10 years since the simian contagion began wiping out a significant part of the human race so when the Caesar company finds a group of humans wandering off into their territory, a shocking verbal warning sends them back to their base in the ruins of San Francisco where their encounter is downplayed by their skeptical leader, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman). The ape army marches to the gates of the human fortress to establish their boundaries and to avoid any conflict. In such an intense scene, the restraint displayed by Caesar and his subordinates is marvelous. Soon after, with a looming power crisis and no other option, Malcolm (Jason Clarke) has to venture into the Ape territory and request them to allow repair work on a dam that can restore electricity to the city. Much to the annoyance of his first subordinate Koba, Caesar permits these humans to work under strict monitoring. With the cunning Koba on one side and a defending Dreyfus on the other, conflict was quite an inevitable outcome to an idea of two states co-existing in a fragile world. As stockpiles of guns are discovered, Koba smells war against the deceiving humans and it doesn't quite help that in his past, he had been subjected to atrocities by them whereas Caesar had seen love and care. Battle lines are drawn and the leader is unfairly ousted. The march of the misdirected apes into the city is set to determine who the dominant species of the planet will be..... There are some epic moments in the film that are enhanced by WETA's astounding work in the CGI and the performance capturing technology. The opening sequence with the deer hunt and a bear attack is thrilling while the showdown of apes riding horses into San Francisco to expose their might in numbers is spell binding to watch. As Koba turns to the dark side and rides aboard a runaway tank heading directly into the human fortress, we witness the carnage all around through a rotating camera mounted on the guns as both sides suffer grave casualties in a fight to defend their homes. Koba's cold hearted murder of a fellow ape crosses the boundaries laid by Caesar's virtuosity and it also displays the mad rage within his trusted second-in- command. The final battle is no longer between two species but between the two most powerful apes who need to establish leadership. Reeves has fun with the CGI in this sequence which yet remains credible due to its execution. But there is nothing more powerful than Caesar's silent walk down the stairs, amidst the remaining apes who bow down to respect his command as the leader who shall protect them against the oncoming attack by more humans. That war, has already begun....Andy Serkis is truly the wizard of facial expressions with his infinite range and adroit ability to portray emotions. Caesar's posture and composure certainly make him an intimidating leader but a laudable performance by Serkis that has a human like range of emotions expressing concern, love, despair and agony, makes the film special. Along with his motion capture co- actors, Andy Serkis does the impossible by making us believe that we are truly watching some very intelligent apes on screen. Reeves' 'Dawn' is a darker tale that represents the survival of the apes in their secluded home. But it lacks the intrigue towards an unknown conclusion as all the battles lead up to a predictable end. In the overall scheme of things, this movie doesn't make much progress in the storyline which will result in The Planet of the Apes. Yet, it is thoroughly enjoyable due to some nimble performances by Andy Serkis and the other ape actors behind WETA's exemplary work with the performance capture technology. The drama and emotions surrounding the simian community is engaging and they command your attention much more than the humans possibly could. Hopefully, there are no humans at all in the next installment because that will really be a triumph of story, characters and technology in epic 3D.8.133 on a scale of 1-10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
196,binducherungath,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a Visual Extravaganza and has the right mix of emotions, actions, performances and technology.",8,13 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a film by Matt Reeves, is extremely high on emotional side. It is great to see the emotional connect between humans and the apes. This movie really explores what happened after 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. If 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was spectacular, this is super-spectacular. The presentation of the movie is so natural and simple that one gets to relate with almost all the characters. Everyone has the right to live on this earth, be it animals or humans, one cannot afford to become the threat for the other. The evolved apes are trying to live their own lives and humans are in the struggle to survive. Each character, whether humans or apes, has been so well crafted and detailed. We get to feel their loss, fear, insecurity, efforts for survival etc. It is great to see the sentient apes, talking, expressing emotions like humans. Apes are shown to be quite rational and forgiving in comparison to humans. In spite of them having experienced human cruelty and imprisonment, now they want peace and just want to be free in their own world away from humans. This movie tells the story of how the declining humans and the ascendant apes come to be at war.The movie begins from where the 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' finished. In the first film, humans gave the apes their intelligence with an experimental drug. Ten years later, humans have largely been wiped out by contagious and deadly side effects of the same experiment. A quick montage gives us an idea of all these happenings since Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It narrates the wake of a flu epidemic, followed by violence and chaos. As a result, Dr. Willman (James Franco) and other millions of people are dead. Human civilization has become almost extinct. The survivors have cobbled together a society in the ruins of San Francisco, with Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) as their leader.On the other side, apes are in the initial stage of their civilization. Initial frames of the movie shows Ceaser (Andy Serkis – what an amazing performance), leader of the apes, with his family and fellow apes in a forest. Outstanding scenes with the apes swinging off the trees, jumping off the walls. Blue eyes (Nick Thurston), teenage son of Caesar and Cornelia (Judy Greer) is shown to be impulsive and short-tempered. Koba (Tony Kebbell), Caesar's adviser feels that Caesar is too affectionate towards humans. Koba has lot of angst towards human beings since he was a test subject for them all his life before he was freed by Caesar. Caesar's second-in-command cum great friend is Rocket (Terry Notary), who is also the honorary uncle of Caesar's children.Humans and apes are almost oblivious to the existence of each other, but the situation changes when humans come face to face with Blue Eyes and Ash (Doc Shaw), Rocket's teenage son. Humans had come there hoping to tap an energy source, basically to gain access to a hydroelectric dam (in apes' territory) which could provide long-term power to the city. Ash is shot at by one of the human Carver (Kirk Acevedo). While Carver calls for rest of his fellow armed survivors, Blue Eyes calls for the other apes. Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, Caesar brings the apes to the city where he orders the humans to never enter ape territory again.Dreyfus believes that humans can survive only when the last ape is killed. According to him, after all, apes are just animals. Whereas, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), Ellie (Keri Russell, Malcolm's second wife) and Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee, Malcolm's son) feel otherwise. Malcolm convinces Dreyfus to give him three days to reconcile with the apes to gain access to the hydroelectric dam in their territory, which Dreyfus, distrustful of the apes, arms survivors using an abandoned armory. Caesar allows Malcolm to work on the dam's generator, provided they surrender their guns. Humans stand in stark contrast to the mostly peaceful apes, who are willing to accommodate the humans if that's what it takes to avoid a war. As Malcolm, his partner Ellie, and son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. Things are smooth when someone does a foul-play and humans and apes clash. Who plays the villain? Who emerges as the planet's dominant species? Does the movie answer as to who is truly at fault for the ultimate destruction of humanity. Watch the movie. The motion capture technology used here is also so perfect, which translates minutest details into animation. Andy Serkis as Caesar tops the list of performers in this movie. Caesar's emotions, rage, sympathy, concern everything is so beautifully captured.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

198,achyutaghosh,Movie of the year!,10,15 July 2014,"Why do we get so many bad mega budget movies, but so very few great ones? Among the many things that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes makes you think, this thought comes back again and again. It is a terrific film, that is not only a thinking person's blockbuster, in the context of the movie, which makes one actually feel the consequences of our choices, and the dying gasps of humanity, but also action packed enough to entertain solely on that front.We last saw Caesar, the hyper intelligent ape lead his rag tag army of chimps, gorillas and orangutans in Rise of the Planet of Apes, across the Golden Gate Bridge into Muir woods. Dawn of The Planet of the Apes is set 10 years later. In that duration, the virus that gave Caesar his intelligence has proved apocalyptic for the human race, as they are all but destroyed. Only one in five hundred survive the simian virus, and those who do, engage in war and riots and cause a complete societal meltdown. As the human civilization slide towards an inevitable doom, the apes thrive. They learn to tame horses, hunt and fish, build homes, provide rudimentary education, and are making baby steps towards articulated speech to supplement their beautiful gesture based communication system. It is interesting to note that nature always pays the price for the progress of any species- and the giant redwoods do so for the apes, as they are felled all over to support the growth of the apes. ""Ape not kill Ape""Caesar, who has seen both the good and bad side of humanity, knows that only this ""no kill"" ideal will ensure that the apes do not go the human way. However, much to Caesar's dismay, the apes prove to be akin in nature to humans. There is subterfuge, war mongering and the appetite for power and retribution in both species. He is unable to contain rabble rouser Koba, who becomes the leader of a bloodthirsty splinter group within the ape society. Rest is a standard war movie, as the increasingly assertive apes plunge headlong into a species defining conflict with the remaining humans. The ending is symbolic as the lead human character quietly steps back into the shadows as Caesar takes his place in the sun. The ending is also one that is soaked in quiet foreboding, and creates even more longing for the upcoming sequel. This is a breakthrough movie by director Matt Reeves, as e is able to create an action movie where you are emotionally invested in digital characters. With that he carefully constructs a series of climaxes, each one bigger, and better than the previous. A chimp on a horse firing off two AK-47s may be as ludicrous as fighting robots or super powered mutants, but Reeves makes it all very believable. The CGI characters are better than the humans, who largely are inconsequential and caricatured. The motion performance capture is so good that you may end up rooting for the opposing species. Andy Serkis pioneered motion capture as Gollum, and does a turn here that is Oscar worthy. The apes are worth the price of the ticket. The boffins at Weta Digital have outdone themselves in creating utterly seamless effects, so much so that the apes seem straight out of a real life National Geographic video.To sum up, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a complex, entertaining, riveting, intelligent and empathy inducing war movie. It kind of brings back the epic back in epic movies, and is easily the best movie of the year .Highly recommended- 10/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
199,abouhelier-r,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,9,31 July 2014,"In the wake of a disaster that changer the world, the growing and genetically evolving apes find themselves at a critical point with the human race. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Matt Reeves. This film is the sequel of the surprisingly good Rise of the Planet of the Apes. When it came out, a few years back now, people were not really into that film but it was pretty good. Matt Reeves actually proves that he CAN direct and deliver a movie which is looking FANTASTIC! This time the film is dealing with a concept of power struggle between Apes and Human but also among the Apes themselves. Plus it shows how people can hate and behave facing difficult times and in front of something that isn't familiar or an other group or race. Along the film we are discovering that Apes are not as different as we could have thought. In fact they are far more evolved than when we met them in the first movie: they have personality, they have interesting inter activities between each others like learning in school, code of conduct, consequences and most importantly a Leader. Caesar definitely steals the movie. We actually get really attach to the Apes. In fact there is no need of words in Apes' dialogues and proper conversations as they use body language, everything can be understood as they have emotional expressions in their eyes. Plus, scenes are all so incredibly powerful and there is a great emotion flawing through the film. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves in every ways possible the first film. The Apes are so well realised thanks to the motion capture work, they actually look like real Apes - which is incredible. Plus Andy Serkis never failed at motion capture he is one of the most talented actor of his generation. ACADEMY LISTEN: This guy has to win an Oscar someday! In fact there are few remarkable technological achievement in this movie, such as special effects, music, direction, motion capture looks, and a great emotional core. I was surprised at every turning point in the story throughout the film like ""wait... we're not predictable, let us tell you the story!"" Finally this film seems truly human to me even if the majority of the protagonist are Apes and it's full of content in relation to its length.Overall this film is smartly optimised, it looks great, have very good cgi, it's exciting, it has good action sequences, great relationships and character development.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
200,Come-and-Review,A huge filmmaking achievement,9,18 July 2017,"If Rise successfully quoted the original 1968 film and introduced a new take on the Planet of the Apes series, Dawn manages to set things in motion the right way, and is far superior its predecessor. The story is set 10 years after a pandemic apocalypse. A familiar premise to post-apoc films, to be sure, but it isn't zombies that the survivors have to face. It is Caesar's highly organised tribe. The story reminds me once again on almost an ""Animal Farm"" take, with apes behaving quite similarly to humans, because, as Caesar says, apes are similar to humans even though he hoped not. Therefore Caesar, Koba and several others behave very humanly, each having their own motivations for their acts. I like how Rocket's role was further developed after what he was in ""Rise"". Similarly human characters are portrayed without a distinction between good or bad, but more likely between protagonists and antagonists. Dreyfuss' motivations are made quite clear.What is even more surpirising, is that half of the characters appear as Computer Generated Imagery. The photorealism is outstandingly convincing, and the mo-cap actors (with Serkis on the lead) could convey through this technology all their talent as well as the other actors.Generally, I really appreciated photography in this film. Some of the shots where outstanding, and there where a few single-take scenes (which, however, didn't last more than a minute of uncut footage or so). Even if much of what you can see on screen in CG, this is a remarkable achievement.The only weak point was the score. I can recognise clearly when I hear a Giacchino score because his ""emotional scene"" theme is almost the same in every movie or TV Show he scored since Lost, partially probably due to the enormous quantity of work he has to do.This is one of the best post-apoc films of the decade. I strongly hope the conclusion of this first trilogy will be as good as this film was, if not better.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

202,blacklist-1,An intelligent and entertaining sci-fi that has heart.,8,22 July 2014,"After the success of the rebooted Rise of the Planet of the Apes back in 2011, a sequel was inevitable. I very much enjoyed the first one as director Rupert Wyatt reinvigorated the franchise refreshingly, which was needed after the 2001 disastrous debacle. My final words of my review of Rise was ""I'm really looking forward to seeing the continuation of the story and seeing how this promising new franchise will continue to develop."" I'm pleased to say Dawn of the Planet of the Apes continues this in good stead in the very capable hands of director Matt Reeves (who has already signed up for the third film). Dawn picks up ten years after Rise where we find the Simian virus has virtually wiped out most of humanity except for a few who are living in the ruins of San Francisco. First though the film directs us smartly to the Apes where we see leader Casear (another excellent performance by Andy Serkis) and his family (wife and two sons) along with other Apes like Koba (Toby Kebbel), Blue Eyes, the son of Casear (Nick Thurston) and Maurice (Karin Konoval) living peacefully in the woods hunting deer and interacting through sign language for years without seeing a human until one day they come across a group in the woods led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) with his wife Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Aex (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Tension is immediate between the human and Apes, which becomes more complicated as the humans need access to a dam to restore power to their base, where the Apes live.Whilst Malcolm and Casear though initially sceptical about one another want peaceful co-existence between the two parties, it's further complicated by human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who hates Apes as well as Koba who dislikes humans as they treated him badly by keeping him captivity and experimenting on him. Throughout there is a delicate uneasy balance between the two parties until an all out war is the only outcome. The differences between the humans and Apes in how they feel (Malcolm and Casear want peace) and (Dreyfus and Koba want war) is nicely mirrored, but this isn't a simple case of good versus evil as soon Malcolm and Casear find common ground through there interactions with each other of love and family. But Koba increasingly angry at the humans and his distrust leads him to turning against his own kind in hurting Casear (as at first Blue Eyes agrees with Koba) and punishing any Ape that sympathises with the humans as he goes out and leads an attack against them.Of course the CGI effects are just amazing as the first one as the motion capture performances are terrific. Again through the facial expressions and words Serkis and Kebell are the two most impressive stars in the film as we feel for both of them, the peace yet scepticism of humans Casear has as well as his love for them (shown in one beautiful scene where Casear watches a video of Will from the first film bonding with him) and the burning hatred Koba feels for them. The human actors gave decent performances too, but the Apes were the real stars of the movie. Over 15,000 people helped make this film and it shows with the incredible amount of effort you can see was put into it. Mesmirising music is provided by Michael Giachinno, the action sequences are terrifically done and very entertaining to watch and there are some truly touching moments in the film between the Apes and humans (mainly Malcolm and Casear) but also between the Apes when Casear watches over his family and Blue Eyes when he apologises to his father for letting him down. This gives the film heart and some substance.The themes of peace, war, nature and family are touched upon, but without any real exploration (though family is to an extent), which is why this stops short of being a brilliant film and a rating of no higher than an 8. I'm not sure what else they could have done to explore these themes, but I just felt the movie was missing that little something extra. The biggest weakness though regrettably like the first movie is the human characters who are not all that memorable. Malcolm makes the most impact, whilst Dreyfus is a wasted opportunity (played well by Gary Oldman) but his screen time is limited. We know his hates Apes, but his motivations are not really explained, though in one scene he cries when looking at photo of his lost family who presumably were killed by the virus, which hints at something, it doesn't come across particularly well (Does he blame the Apes for killing his family?) Malcolm is serviced by a wife (who is a doctor and saves Casear) and a son who are there to maybe humanise his character. But like the Vet Caroline in the first one, they are completely expendable and really didn't need to be in the film at all.However though Dawn didn't blow me away, this was as good as Rise and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It's rare to find sci-fi's that have intelligence as well as heart, but this one has it in abundance. I look forward in great anticipation to the third film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
203,sandnair87,"Forget Motion-Capture, This is Motion-Rapture!",9,14 April 2016,"A decade has passed since the simian flu ravaged mankind. Living a peaceful existence in the wilderness of a San Francisco forest near an abandoned dam, the apes have carved out a life without humans who they presume have long died out due to the simian flu virus. Their leader Caesar (Andy Serkis) has set up an enormous community of primates and has taught sign language to his subjects, and some, like him, can even speak. The genetically-evolving apes are celebrating the arrival of a new baby, all the time wondering if humans have indeed been wiped out. But alas, the ape's idyllic lifestyle is rudely interrupted! When least expected, up trundles a bunch of those pesky humans led by family man Malcolm (Jason Clarke), searching for hydro-electric power. If the humans can restart the nearby dam, you know it really will be a case of ""lights back on, camera and... action""! After a period of deliberation, negotiation and intimidation tactics between the species a raging battle begins.'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' presents a simple conflict of interests, but the characters on either side are written with an appealing depth. What could have easily become an annoying cavalcade of obvious mix-ups between species becomes something so much more fascinating. The humans' leader (Gary Oldman), for instance, who wants to decimate the apes if they won't allow access to the dam, is not a mustache-twirling sadist but simply a frightened and grieving man charged with protecting his small pocket of humanity. On the other side, the intelligent, heroic and non-belligerent Caesar has a scarred and bad-ass adviser, Koba (Toby Kebbell), who hates humans because they tortured him in the lab. Caesar still remembers the kindness he received from some humans and brokers a peace between the two factions. This does not sit well with Koba who longs to battle. He will soon get his wish.Matt Reeves takes the reins of this shrewd franchise and runs confidently with visceral wanton destruction. He conjures a spectacle, delivering both action and character drama, that has you cheering on instinctively. When you are sufficiently captivated by the story not to raise so much as a smile at the spectacle of an enraged chimpanzee on horseback brandishing a machine gun, then you have to give credit where it's due. Andy Serkis doffs the motion capture cap as Caesar. He gives Caesar a quiet dignity and, almost makes him human in his emotions. The digital effects are seamless and combined with Serkis' acting beneath it, a believable sense of compassion and anger is conveyed. Toby Kebbell excels in being completely terrifying under his ape guise, enabling the scenes between himself and Serkis to become tightly wound and impactful drama. The humans take somewhat of a back seat but help guide the story along with their meddling and moral turmoil.All through this riveting drama, your disbelief remains willfully suspended. Forget motion-capture, this is motion-rapture!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
204,spencergrande6,An improvement on Rise,8,20 August 2017,"An improvement on Rise, that film's sci-fi ambitions a tad undercooked. Here the focus is on psychology. Koba is a great villain, with a strong performance from Toby Kebbell who has some hilarious ""playing"" dumb-ape scenes that are perfect - until he becomes a simplistic power hungry mad hatter at the end. He was broken by the world and thought he was helping the apes, then suddenly at the end he becomes simply insane and angry. The other ""villain"", Gary Oldman, is vastly underwritten - in fact the humans are in general. This film is less about a rift between humans and apes then it is about Caesar realizing apes aren't just inherently good because they're apes and not humans. I wish the ending were tighter in general and the human dilemma equal to the apes.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
205,priyantha-bandara,Sci fi with a brain is finally here,9,15 November 2014,"Matt Reeves'es vision of science fiction is different to many. His movies take emotions in to count than the pure side of the movies scientific nature. This is well proved with his earlier movies like Cloverfield (2008) and Let Me In (2010). And now he teams up with the writers of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and brings this much improved and very successful sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and it is magnificent. Right from the very beginning to the last scene this movie will take you through an emotional journey of man and ape alike and puts you in a tight spot as a human to determine the fate of things to come and decide write and wrong.Ten years after the pandemic decease humans are at the brink of extinction. The apes who have survived lives in the woods formed up massive crowds and a form of civilized living. But when the humans bring war to the Apes door step and Apes leadership is questioned, the battle rages.The very first thing that will blow the minds of the viewer is how insanely good looking this movie is. Thanks to the astounding works of the computer graphics and set creation the green rainy forest and the abandoned dying city both look absolutely realistic. And when the thought provoking plot is mixed up with ultra-realistic expressions of the apes this movie can sink right down in to you. And speaking of the plot it's carefully written to give the viewer a very good perception of things occurring and the flow is very good.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes as a story is completely far-fetched and it is amazing how it works this well. But if you're expecting more and more battles of large scale and less talk (or sigh language) then it might disappoint you a bit. But never forget that battles are never justifiable without the correct amount of emotions. And here the wait for the final battle is worth every bit of drama and once you realize that the world will never be the same again for Apes and Humans both there is slight hope left for both. And amazingly you might wish that apes will find their peace once again. Make your own judgment of who's to be blamed, us or our ancestors.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
206,comps-784-38265,Dreary let down,5,22 July 2014,"I enjoyed the previous film and after seeing the high review scored shelled out the exorbitant cost to go to the cinema. None of the characters inspire any real interest. The story is boring and predictable. With stereotype bad people/bad apes versus a few good men/apes. I always like a good, post apocalyptic film, unfortunately this was not it! Very disappointed, it's not desperately awful just very mediocre. I often regret the exorbitant cost of going to the cinema and certainly did this time. Wish I had waited till it came out on TV. My advice is don't waste your money wait till it comes out on TV or streaming service.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
207,Spartan_1_1_7,One of this year's best movie.,8,30 October 2014,"Ever since I missed the opportunity to watch it in cinema, I have been waiting anxiously to watch it at home. I really liked the first part and this just goes above and beyond it. The movie starts off where the last part left off, we see how the ALZ113 drug that enhances Ape brain activity acts as a deadly virus for humans. Majority of humanity is wiped out due to it. 10 years later, Apes are living peacefully whereas humans are trying their best to survive. Ceaser, the leader of the Apes, might very well be one of the best CGI characters to ever put on film thanks to Andy Serkis amazing motion capture performance. Definitely deserves an Oscar for this. People involved in motion capture of other notable Ape characters like Koba also deserve a nod. They all had personalities, emotions and whatnot and I really felt involved with them even if most of their conversations consisted of sign language, now that takes some really hard work to accomplish. On the other side, we had human drama and characters. Where other movies focus more on humans, who usually are lame, this movie (Reboot franchise) greatly succeeds here. Not only does it know where to focus more (Apes), the human characters themselves are pretty good and any scenes with them doesn't feel like distraction. Other Directors should take notes from this movie. Leadership, family, loyalty, survival and love are heavily focused themes in the movie and we get to see a great execution of all of them under a mostly dark, gritty environment. Aside of all the drama and conflicts, we are treated to some great action scenes too. Beautifully shot and directed with some awesome continuous shots. All of it is complemented by a great soundtrack, which fits perfectly to the atmosphere of the movie.The CGI work is some of the best I have EVER SEEN. The Apes look more real than real apes if that makes sense. Another awesome movie of this year's amazing summer season. One of the best of the year so far. Definitely a MUST WATCH. Now I can't wait for the third part.8.8/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
208,CMTiago,"The stakes grow higher, apes & humans collide",8,30 April 2015,"After the events of the 2011 predecessor, Dawn is set 10 years into the future, where Caeser has a built an ape community that is flourishing. Meanwhile, the humans are struggling to survive as they have become dispersed due to the effects of the virus that was released in Rise. When a group of survivors from the San Fransisco area run into two apes, the plot will be set in motion as these two factions will collide.I gotta say that after the good work done by Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, I was hoping for a sequel to up the ante and present me with even bigger stakes. Not only did Dawn do that, but also served up a kind of character depth one doesn't see too much in a summer blockbuster. We all know of Andy Serkis's legacy in motion capture performances and he once again delivers as Caeser, the ape leader who must deal with the human issue, while also having to prevent a rebellion within his own ranks. This bad seed among Caeser and his apes is Koba, an ape who seeks revenge given the abuse he suffered at the hands of humans. Toby Kebell gives the surprise performance in the movie as Koba turns from a trusted right hand adviser to a treacherous villain. The humans take a back seat in terms of plot importance, as should be expected from a movie with Apes in the title. Still their secondary role is effective and names such as Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Gary Oldman give the performances that were asked of them.Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is unlike any movie being released nowadays. It seems to exist in its own brand of blockbuster cinema, something I find very refreshing. Here's to hoping the trend continues with the follow up movies in this series.Rating: 8,5/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
209,deastman_uk,Worth a Monkey,6,23 July 2014,"I wasn't surprised that this material was raided from the past, and it seems there is still a reasonable amount of respect for it. But with the large number of natural history shows in the intervening years, a higher level of realism had to be applied.This is written almost as a low budget young adult TV show plot, but applied to apes and men. The strength of the film is in the visuals and some of the survival aesthetic, not in the plot which displays most of Hollywood's shortcuts, tropes and sloppiness. But both humour and melodrama are sucked out to keep the action rolling, and this drives the entertainment.That aesthetic is pulled from the best of survivalist TV serials as well as video games. It also harks back a little to the original films. Watching the different apes work together is a joy, and the alien nature of their structures is well observed. Caesar is in the main brilliantly acted through Andy Sirkis, though Koba is a close second. As is usual with these things, you will get much more out of the film if you remember the previous one.This film is solid franchise building block for something special next time.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
210,quinimdb,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7,18 July 2017,"When was the last time you were watching a big budget summer blockbuster and in the first fifteen minutes, the characters and their relationships were established without any spoken dialogue, all while keeping your interest? ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" had the difficult task of telling a serious, live action, relatable, human story, despite most of its main characters being apes. This was a technical challenge because they needed to use motion capture technology to transform tons of human actors into realistic looking apes with believable movements, yet the performances of the actors playing the apes and the CGI are both incredibly natural most of the time. This was a narrative challenge because they needed to find out the best way to communicate the thoughts of the apes, yet they managed to make their actions speak for them and their few words hold so much more weight. This was a financial challenge because of the high budget needed to make the film and the general publics willingness to read subtitles, yet they managed to keep them engaged.Again and again, Matt Reeves continued to exceed my expectations with this film, not only making me genuinely care about a bunch of apes, but by telling a smart allegorical tale about racism, war, and technology's role in humanity. You don't have to see the first film in order to see this one, since all the exposition you need is cut together in a clever montage showing the downfall of humanity and the rise of the apes, allowing this film to stand on its own. After humanity began to fall from the virus, the apes became independent in the forest and began living creating their own civilization, while, unbeknownst to them, a group of immune humans lives near by, trying to restore their civilization by holding the belief that electricity will help them get back to the place they were before. When the last resort to power their city is by using water, they are forced to come into contact with the apes that are living on the dam, and tensions begin to arise.The visceral, emotional climax of this film is incredibly shot, with many long tracking or panning shots showing the all out pandemonium happening around them, as well as an intense, hand to hand fight scene, all done with almost entirely CGI characters.The film delves surprisingly deep into the origins and hypocrisy of war, showing how preconceived notions start fear and hostility, which fosters more fear and hostility, which blinds one side from the good people in the opposing group, and blinds one group from the bad people in their own group. It also shows how even the possession of weapons just causes more paranoia, causing the other group to feel the need to protect themselves with weapons, pulling both groups further and further apart from each other, despite how similar they may be.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
211,rprince-832-6294,Dawn of a Great Movie!,8,11 July 2014,"-Dawn of Planet of the Apes is the highly anticipated sequel for the prequel Rise of Planet of the Apes. And since it is not called ""Dawn of Planet of the Human"" we know exactly how it goes down.-By the way the film was Great!! It was the perfect runtime with a great pace, great characters, and an emotional story.-The plot is executed excellently! Seeing good characters that are fighting for the same thing and the bad characters fighting for the same thing as well is really captivating. Also in this, the apes are totally in charge, so it is fun to see how that plays out too. One of the few drawbacks in the film is that not much gets accomplished in the film. I could sum it up pretty easily, but I won't spoil it because it rocks.-The cast was great. Gary Oldman and that other guy were both great and deep characters. Andy Serkis did Oscar well! He is as good as Caesar as he is Gollum. Yeah.-The music was very good. Michael Giacchino combined the emotional elements of Rise of Planet of The Apes with the ape-like feel of Jerry Goldsmith's original Planet of the Apes score. One of the other drawbacks is that the Goldsmith style of ape music is almost ambient music instead of captivating pieces.-THE EFFECTS WERE FLAWLESS. As good as Avatar. I kid you not, there were several shots that I literally thought (and think) were real apes. This film WILL get an Oscar not for CGI, if not a win! -Content was not too bad. There was some violence, some intense images, and some language which included like 2 S-words and one F-word. Not toooo bad, but not a ""Hey, take your kids to see apes wipe out mankind! :D"" kinda film.-That said, Dawn of Planet of The Apes is thrilling, and 2 hours of character, amazing effects, and a story that won't really let you go until the end. I would say Dawn of Planet of The Apes is easily worth seeing in theaters! (Note: You really need to see Rise of Planet of the Apes first)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
212,destinylives52,The Best In The Planet Of The Apes Movies,9,12 February 2017,"10 years after the end of ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes,"" Simian Flu has killed 99.8% of the humans, putting people in a new Dark Age. As the humans struggle to survive, apes, under the leadership of Caesar (played by Andy Serkis), thrive in the new world order. It is the ""Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes."" It is remarkable to see what the apes have created in 10 years: a home within a forest; a school that teaches young apes sign language; Caesar having the ability to speak; and a set of laws that apes have given themselves, such as ""ape not kill ape.""For a decade, Serkis and his group of hundreds of evolving apes haven't had contact with humans, assuming all people have died. This assumption is quickly proved wrong when two apes run into a small group of humans, resulting in an injury to an ape and fueling more distrust between the two species. But a human, played by Jason Clarke, makes a plea to Serkis to allow the humans to work in ape territory so that the humans can get back electric power and have some semblance of civilization back.After discussing the delicate situation with his inner circle of apes, Serkis decides to help the humans instead of making war with them. Serkis not only hopes of a peaceful future with the humans, he's also aware that the humans still have guns; and war with the humans can mean total destruction for the apes. Unfortunately, his right-hand-ape, Koba, is not of the same mindset; and Koba's hatred for all humans will make him do whatever it takes to destroy the fragile peace so that an all out war against the human survivors will be triggered.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes"" is the scene immediately before Koba leads an attack against the human city. The humans, alerted to the impending assault, have manned their towers and gates, heavily armed with automatic rifles, machine-guns, and grenade launchers. They wait and stare at the open road that leads to their city. It is quiet, but it is only the calm before the storm. Beyond where the humans' lights can reach, the sounds of hundreds of apes screaming slowly becomes audible.I have seen every ""Planet Of The Apes"" movie, and this is the best of them. From the beginning, I was amazed. Yes, ""Dawn"" doesn't have the ""holy s*#t"" surprise ending of the first movie (the 1968 version, not the reboot), but it does rival the first movie's social commentaries; and of course, it crushes the first movie when it comes to action and special effects.One final thought: watch and listen carefully during the scene when the apes were discussing what they should do with the newly discovered humans. I immediately thought that this probably played out hundreds of years ago when Native Americans were discussing what to do with the newly discovered white settlers on their lands.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
213,cdjh-81125,The Dawn For A Superior Sequel,8,7 August 2017,"I can't say I loved Rise of The Planet of The Apes but I enjoyed it for what it was and left me excited for what was to come next and Dawn of The Planet of The Apes met my expectations by improving on Rise and being much more of a character based drama from all perspectives. The thing that carries this film is it well rounded characters, both ape and human alike. I didn't matter what species they were because they were so well developed it allowed you to see things from the perspective of every character and it became increasingly difficult to choose what side to support. Even when some did something that you couldn't support it was still easy to understand their choices and feel something for the characters who made them. All the performances in this film were excellent Andy Serkis continues to prove that he is an actor like no other he just perfectly nails the heart and soul of Caesar and there could not have been a more perfect choice to play him. Toby Kebbell has never really impressed me but I have to say I loved him in this movie, he nailed Koba's rougher and more damaged nature and makes it clear how much similar Caesar could have been to him had his upbringing been ever so slightly different. Jason Clarke was very good in this movie, he was very easy to get behind and never felt as if he was out of place. Gary Oldman was fantastic in this movie he easily gave the best performance of the human cast with the way he made you feel sympathy for his character. This film looks stunning and lot darker and more dreary than Rise but that feels appropriate for the darker tone this film is trying to convey. The world feels and looks as if it has been through hell and never makes you second guess that it has. The filmmakers really set the darker tone for the movie very early one and I loved that about this movie, its ability to go much darker when it needs to and always feels appropriate when it goes down that path. Matt Reeves directed this movie in a phenomenal way, he's great and showing scale as well as scope, he has a keen eye for action sequences which are all fantastic and nothing less than believable. The CGI for the apes is again spectacular, you feel as if you truly are watching walking and talking apes, thanks to the special effects in equal parts to the actors who so perfectly portray them. My biggest issue with this movie, like Rise, is the material for the human characters. Like I said they establish them very well and all make understandable choice the problem is that there story was just simply never as interesting. The arguing and tension among them felt quite standard and less interesting in comparison to the apes and the whole plot set up the repair the damn never really went anywhere. This new trilogy had consistently surprised me, I like them all a hell of a lot more than I ever thought I would and has always given me plenty to think about while I am watching them. This film looks amazing, has fantastic direction, well rounded characters with superb interaction between them. Despite some issues with the human characters I find myself enjoying this franchise more and more with every new release. 8.7/10: A- (Fantastic)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
214,freshclean-66-318608,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.,7,28 January 2015,"This was a good film and I really enjoyed it but to me it wasn't as good as the first one. This one was light on the action and focused more on drama with conflicts igniting within the human world as well as the ape world. Basically it was about united we stand, divided we fall, for both sides. With that in mind I think the more advanced the apes get in the films the more like humans they become, and not in a good way and I think that is what Ceasar, the leader of the apes, is going to start realizing. I think this film is just setting the stage for a third installment of the new ""Planet of the Apes"" motif anyway. So if there is another installment of the ""Planet of the Apes"" theme, hopefully there will be lots of action in it, but like I said before, this is a good film it just wasn't as exhilarating as the first.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
215,elenaphysics,Not good,3,6 April 2015,"I found the Rise of the planet of the Apes an excellent film ,that is why I had set very high expectations for this sequel. But it was not good. I did not like the story, I did not like the plot, I did not like it at all. Except 1 or 2 nice scenes, the movie was quite bad. Not interesting at all. It was longer than it should ( because the plot was quite plain and basic). The first movie was original. This one was not. If you could switch the Apes with humans, then you would have a typical story of a peaceful leader who wants peace and prosperity for his people and doesn't want them to get into war with an enemy tribe, but some of his people do not want peace and after treason, they misguide the peaceful tribe into war. Until the leader steps back in and stops the hostilities.. I have no idea, how many movies I have watched dealing with a similar subject. For me it was a huge disappointment because the first film was quite a novelty, whilst this one was very common. As I aforementioned the movie was too long for its plot. It was as if they were doing it on purpose just to say ,hey this movie is long because it is complex and has a lot of action. But it did not. I am disappointed",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
216,joshuadrake-91275,A great and successful sequel to a reboot and one of the best summer movies of 2014,10,15 September 2015,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a great and successful sequel to it's 2011 predecessor and reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and it is one of the best movies of the 2014 summer season! The film is just phenomenal. There is more to this movie than just a summer movie that was critically acclaimed by critics and audiences.This is the eighth theatrical film in the franchise, overall. The critics and audiences praised this film for it's visual effects, story, direction, music, acting and it's focus on emotional depth. I will get into the story of the film first before I get into the other stuff that I like about this movie.The film is set ten years after ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", this film establishes that a virus called the ""Simian Flu"" that increased the intelligence of the apes has killed most of the human race. Our main protagonist, Caesar struggles to maintain peace as his ape community is drawn into an all-out war with nearby human survivors. The plot is easy to follow, it may take a couple of re-watches to know what is going on, but to me, the plot was simply well-written and I give credit to Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver, who wrote a very great script and story that is just one of the greatest film stories ever created.Now, I get to the other stuff. The first thing I start off with is the concept of the film. A lot of people has said that this film is like The Empire Strikes Back of the Planet of the Apes films and that is exactly what it feels like. A lot critics have liked the combination of an engaging script with impressive special effects and this movie does not fail at all. Story: 8.9 / 10.I move on to the special effects. I love the CGI and motion-capture for the apes in this film as much as I thought I would like and from my point of view, the visual effects company who did this film's work also did the effects for the Lord of the Rings, as well as Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the 1933 film, King Kong. The visual effects are just impressive.The music by Michael Giacchino, is very amazing and with the choir and orchestra, it feels like an actual Planet of the Apes musical score. A lot of critics really liked the musical score. Me, I definitely like it when I hear a choir in a film's musical score, such as The Polar Express, the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars prequel trilogies as well as The Dark Knight Trilogy. The music is just amazing.The direction by Matt Reeves is just amazing. I have seen his other movie, Cloverfield, which is produced by J.J. Abrams and it is simply amazing, but this film, he really had a lot to prove and it shows because it does not feel like it's a very long movie. The film is as long as it needs to be -- 2 hours and 10 minutes -- is just all I need for this kind of movie. His way of directing the action scenes are great and when stuff goes down in this movie, stuff is going down. I'm talking a big battle with the humans going against the apes and everything, but the best fight scene was at the end when Caesar and the main antagonist, Koba has this one heck of a fight, in which Koba begs for his life, saying ""Apes does not kill apes"" and Caesar tells him, ""You are not ape"" and lets him fall to his death. That part was disturbing for me, but it was also action-packed. The emotional scenes are what really got me to like this movie, along with the action, but the emotional depth that this movie focuses on is really amazing to see.Now, I move on to the final thing that I will mention and that is the acting. Caesar is played once again by Andy Serkis and his performance was so great that I was actually happy to see him in this part again. He blew me away as Gollum and he blew me away even more as the title character, King Kong. I felt that he should have won an Academy Award for his performance capture acting.Toby Kebbell plays the villainous Koba and he is just great, there are moments where he scares you but he works nicely. Judy Greer plays Cornelia and she is great. Nick Thurston plays Blue Eyes and he is great also and Karin Konoval plays Maurice and he is good as well.Now, I move on to the human characters: Jason Clarke, plays Malcolm and he does a really great job in his performance. Gary Oldman plays the role of Dreyfus and he makes a good character work, especially when Oldman played Jim Gordon and Sirius Black, those performances were great. Keri Russell plays Ellie, Malcolm's wife and she does a really amazing job and Kodi-Smit McPhee plays their son, which I am surprised to see him in this film.Overall, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is just a well-made that I think needs to be seen by everyone, not just kids, but family members and film students as well. Also, for kids, who would like to make movies one day, like I do, this is a movie that you should see. If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, let them watch it and see what effect it has on them.

217,LiamBlackburn,No,6,24 July 2014,"No no no, sorry. The apes would not be able to ride horses like that. This is ridiculous, look at their center of gravity. THe CGI looks absolutely ridiculous. Seriously, who let that through the editing stage. Otherwise, it is a good movie. Cool scenery and acting. The guy with the glasses from Batman, he is probably the best actor in the movies today. This is not far from what America will look like in about 30 years. It will be overrun with wild apes and there will be complete lawlessness and chaos. It will be a jungle out there. The lull moments of the movie are a big downer, who really cares about the emotional stuff, we just want to see apes smashing skulls.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
218,joshuadrake-39480,A great and successful sequel to a reboot and one of the best summer movies of 2014!,10,24 April 2015,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a great and successful sequel to it's 2011 predecessor and reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and it is one of the best movies of the 2014 summer season! The film is just phenomenal. There is more to this movie than just a summer movie that was critically acclaimed by critics and audiences.This is the eighth theatrical film in the franchise, overall. The critics and audiences praised this film for it's visual effects, story, direction, music, acting and it's focus on emotional depth. I will get into the story of the film first before I get into the other stuff that I like about this movie.The film is set ten years after ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", this film establishes that a virus called the ""Simian Flu"" that increased the intelligence of the apes has killed most of the human race. Our main protagonist, Caesar struggles to maintain peace as his ape community is drawn into an all-out war with nearby human survivors. The plot is easy to follow, it may take a couple of re-watches to know what is going on, but to me, the plot was simply well-written and I give credit to Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver, who wrote a very great script and story that is just one of the greatest film stories ever created.Now, I get to the other stuff. The first thing I start off with is the concept of the film. A lot of people has said that this film is like The Empire Strikes Back of the Planet of the Apes films and that is exactly what it feels like. A lot critics have liked the combination of an engaging script with impressive special effects and this movie does not fail at all. Story: 8.9 / 10.I move on to the special effects. I love the CGI and motion-capture for the apes in this film as much as I thought I would like and from my point of view, the visual effects company who did this film's work also did the effects for the Lord of the Rings, as well as Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the 1933 film, King Kong. The visual effects are just impressive.The music by Michael Giacchino, is very amazing and with the choir and orchestra, it feels like an actual Planet of the Apes musical score. A lot of critics really liked the musical score. Me, I definitely like it when I hear a choir in a film's musical score, such as The Polar Express, the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars prequel trilogies as well as The Dark Knight Trilogy. The music is just amazing. The direction by Matt Reeves is just amazing. I have seen his other movie, Cloverfield, which is produced by J.J. Abrams and it is simply amazing, but this film, he really had a lot to prove and it shows because it does not feel like it's a very long movie. The film is as long as it needs to be -- 2 hours and 10 minutes -- is just all I need for this kind of movie. His way of directing the action scenes are great and when stuff goes down in this movie, stuff is going down. I'm talking a big battle with the humans going against the apes and everything, but the best fight scene was at the end when Caesar and the main antagonist, Koba has this one heck of a fight, in which Koba begs for his life, saying ""Apes does not kill apes"" and Caesar tells him, ""You are not ape"" and lets him fall to his death. That part was disturbing for me, but it was also action-packed. The emotional scenes are what really got me to like this movie, along with the action, but the emotional depth that this movie focuses on is really amazing to see. Now, I move on to the final thing that I will mention and that is the acting. Caesar is played once again by Andy Serkis and his performance was so great that I was actually happy to see him in this part again. He blew me away as Gollum and he blew me away even more as the title character, King Kong. I felt that he should have won an Academy Award for his performance capture acting.Toby Kebbell plays the villainous Koba and he is just great, there are moments where he scares you but he works nicely. Judy Greer plays Cornelia and she is great. Nick Thurston plays Blue Eyes and he is great also and Karin Konoval plays Maurice and he is good as well.Now, I move on to the human characters: Jason Clarke, plays Malcolm and he does a really great job in his performance. Gary Oldman plays the role of Dreyfus and he makes a good character work, especially when Oldman played Jim Gordon and Sirius Black, those performances were great. Keri Russell plays Ellie, Malcolm's wife and she does a really amazing job and Kodi-Smit McPhee plays their son, which I am surprised to see him in this film. Overall, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is just a well-made that I think needs to be seen by everyone, not just kids, but family members and film students as well. Also, for kids, who would like to make movies one day, like I do, this is a movie that you should see. If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, let them watch it and see what effect it has on them. This is movie worth buying on DVD and also watching on TV, because this movie is spectacular, remarkable, majestic, amazing, emotional and breathtaking. My rating is a 10 out of 10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
219,Paynebyname,"Disappointing. One step forward in CGI, two steps backward in story telling",5,28 July 2014,"I had been really looking forward to Dawn but it was a wasted opportunity in my opinion.I liked how in the original that you felt for Caesar and the apes and their plight was a simple one in just wanting to get to the forest. Okay an origin story always offers more meat but it had me a lot more involved than Dawn which was ultimately a leadership struggle film.I felt this film was weaker because it descended into the rather clichéd dad trying to connect with his son, 2nd in command wants to take over, they have a big bust up at the end. If the main protagonists were humans and not superbly rendered apes, I think some more might think the story a little predictable, almost like the Lion King.It's like how I thought the first was clever for showing the monkey strengths and ingenuity in outsmarting the humans. However in this film the monkeys wouldn't actually have been any good at aiming the guns or reloading. So although cool seeing them fire guns, the humans would still have had a tactical advantage.I'm not saying this to be a spoil sport for the action scenes but it was lazy film making that the makers didn't then think of a clever way to use the monkey strengths to get round this tactical weakness.Fox bundled the original director out of the way for daring to want to make something of equal calibre and switched in Reeves to create an inferior sequel that hit all of the generic blockbuster marks but had no real heart. Maybe this is proof that recreating the 'lightening in a bottle' of Rise does require a little more time and effort than simply throwing money at special effects.For me it was one step forward in the technology and CGI but two steps back in the story telling. In Rise, the effects aided the story. In Dawn, they were the story.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
220,bogus-bogus-one,"This is so bad - save your money, wait for it on network TV.",1,27 July 2014,"Welcome to ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", this summers so-called blockbuster. Every year there is at least one movie that undeservedly ""takes off"" like this. From the current IMDb rating you might believe this is a sure thing, the ""must-see"" film of the summer. Not so fast.Having been a fan since the original, I really want to see these new releases succeed. Even when they fall short, I would rarely take the time to write a negative review. Unfortunately this is so bad AND the hype surrounding the film has been so outrageous and misleading.... I really feel compelled to add my two cents.Most importantly to me, this film is just plain boring. Other reviewers have been gushing over the special effects and I'll admit the CGI is moderately interesting. I did think about the technical details... for about a minute. The film cannot stand up purely on the special effects. There is no amount of computer processing power can save this storyline. CGI cannot add depth to cardboard characters or make them appealing.So why are people buying tickets and giving this film such good reviews? I really wish I knew. I'll just add it to the list of movies whose success doesn't make any sense to me. Some films just get lucky I guess. Like Zero Dark Thirty.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

222,FilmMuscle,"A Technical Upgrade, A Narrative Downgrade",6,16 July 2014,"Whenever people accuse me of being an unreasonable hater of summer blockbusters, I immediately refer to my love for 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apesor perhaps it's because that was one of the few smart blockbusters in a while. There was a lack of superficiality and a lot more honesty—about the selfishness of humanity, about the spine-chilling advancement of science and technology, about the rest of the animal kingdom's possible distaste for our kind, etc. Witnessing Caesar's ascent to leadership and pure intelligence, finally afforded the opportunity to oppose the human forces that once caged and abused him, was a major element that boosted the film's quality beyond any expectations. Now, with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the gradual rise and reign of the apes over Earth continues in the highly anticipated sequel. A decade after the events of the first one, Caesar and his followers have found refuge in the forests of San Francisco, trying to maintain peace between their species and the humans. Of course, certain balances of power and damaged relationships complicate matters, deeming this desperate attempt at coexistence utterly hopeless. First of all, the absolute strongest aspect of this blockbuster is its impressive use of technology; that of which helps create amazing performances from both Andy Serkis (portraying the relatively mild- tempered and subtly emotive Ceaser) and Toby Kebbell (portraying the deeply menacing/frightening and cunning Koba). To no surprise, the visuals are outstanding in their realism as to the appearance of the apes—never a dip in the CGI's quality in order to prevent such a premise from becoming a blatant cheese-fest, which it could've easily been (apes on horses with machine guns, for God's sake). The production value— allowing for a fascinatingly different, alternate Earth—and the design behind Caesar's lair is spectacular, and there's never any doubt that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes succeeds in its technical prowess. On the narrative's front, however, it unfortunately never matches the intrigue and thoughtfulness of its predecessor, which was led by James Franco—a considerably more charismatic presence than any of the human characters here. We also had John Lithgow whose disease-stricken character brought a heartbreaking facet into the mix, again more captivating than any of the characters in the sequel. I mean, Gary Oldman (an otherwise fantastic actor as we all know) is barely given any material to work with in this case; Keri Russell really has nothing to do besides express her concern for her husband, Malcolm (Jason Clarke— the human lead of the film) who is fairly devoid of personality as well besides the fact that he's really curious about Caesar. In fact, Koba and the primate overlord are truly the only interesting characters in the story as their conflicted friendship resumes. I also found it distracting how kind and forgiving Caesar was depicted in this film as opposed to Rise. The filmmakers seemingly played it safe and shined away from a potentially engrossing human-versus-ape war and instead focused on the ape-versus-ape conflict that's stirred between two troubled sides. Herein, we're presented with a common tale about two political positions in a culture—one is the good guy who wants peace and the other wants to eradicate the race, in question, altogether and solely live with his own kind. How often have we seen that? Well, the audience will be seeing it again, thereby stifling the momentum that Rise carefully and cleverly constructed in which the slow, but eventual, overtaking of the apes was a lot clearer. For the sake of further comparison, the 2011 installment presented a compelling study of scientific advancement and the apes' intellectual and emotional growth in their revolt against the ruling race that is humanity. Here, the apes try to be as benevolent as possible and forgive every wrong human action, as severe as they can be. In all honesty, there are very few complex characters in this follow-up; you're either outlandishly villainous like Koba—or let's look at an over-the- top bully like Carver—or a perfect upstanding citizen like Malcolm. Keep in mind that Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) does not possess enough screen time to dissolve the confusion formed around his exact motivations and true identity—so, very miniscule depth there as well. In terms of the movie's overall structure, the beginning is deliberately paced, introducing us to the environment that the regnant apes have erected for themselves and showcasing the interactions between our primary apes. After a tense development of the two species' relationship, we're propelled into a war film that carries a familiar friend-gone-rogue plot (closely resembling Shakespeare's revered tale, Julius Caesar, and thus entering somewhat heavy-handed territory) that unravels quite predictably and, of course, leads to an ultimate showdown between the clear good and evil: Caesar pitted against Koba. Admittedly, plenty of epically staged battle sequences and dramatic clashes await, and I certainly enjoyed the intense segments on the surface. But when you observe the film from a narrative perspective, it's utterly lacking in the surprise and creative energy that astonishingly unleashed into cinemas three years ago.Side note: let's also note that particularly misleading poster which shows Caesar on a horse, aggressively taunting with his assault rifle, implying that he's fully prepared for war, which as we all know turned out to be the total opposite in the actual film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
223,tinovalkki,Brilliant movie,9,20 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a brilliant movie. As a Hollywood movie it is a surprisingly dark and brooding movie. Movies pessimistic temper makes this movie so dark and won't give much of hope for peace. Movie is visually stunning and clever. It is might be better to watch as 2D, because 3D glasses makes it almost too dim to watch. Once again 3D has not exploited enough. Just to bring a stereographic images are not enough. That is perhaps only reason I can't give full five stars to this movie. Apes are animated beautifully and elaborated. Andy Serkis is brilliant as a Caesar. Movie grows epic with Caesar's character. Even human characters are interesting, especially Gary Oldman as Dreyfus. Matt Reeves has made a perfect summer block buster movie and it is nice to know that he already works with a sequel.

225,jaredpahl,Planet of the Apes And High-Brow Drama Clash In This Unbearably Pretentious Garbage,2,25 August 2014,"I would not call myself a huge Planet of the Apes fan. The first film is a classic, the rest of the original movies are average at best, and Tim Burton's film was a passable popcorn flick. However, it wasn't until 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes that my interest in the series really ignited. The film had an excellent story to tell about how an experimental Alzheimer's drug could lead to world takeover by super-intelligent apes. It was suspenseful, exciting, and a real thrill to watch. Plus, it had some great performances from James Franco, John Lithgow, and Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of the Apes. Rise was one of my favorite films of the year, and when I found out a sequel would be coming out, I was understandably excited. I awaited a bigger, more action-packed movie than Rise that would hopefully give me more of what I loved about its predecessor. Much to my chagrin, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes carries over none of the freshness or charm of Rise. Dawn is a fatally pompous, self-important, and generic slog through an uninspired planet of the apes.The movie is a post-apocalyptic story told both from the human and ape point-of-view. The apes do have a somewhat interesting story; particularly a dramatic betrayal between two ape leaders, Caesar, motion captured by Andy Serkis and the scarred bonobo Koba (Toby Kebbell). The human actors manage to convincingly pretend to be talking animals, but I fail to find anything really special in these motion capture performances. On the other side of the story are the human characters, and let's just get to the point, they have nothing remotely interesting to do, and not one of them is at all interesting as a character. Gary Oldman acts the Hell out of every scene he's in, but even his scenery-gnawing presence can't save the humans in this movie from feeling utterly dull and pointless. The post-apocalyptic story is as generic as it gets, pitting a band of survivors against the odds in a struggle to get power to the city. It is the type of broad ""post-apocalyptic"" story that seems like it was lifted straight from an episode of The Walking Dead. You would think there would be more imagination and ideas for a future where apes rule the world, but there is no such thing here. It is the same dilapidated cityscape and band of survivors schtick we see in every cheap zombie apocalypse movie/show nowadays. Thankfully, the apes take center stage, and while their story is more interesting than the humans', the seriousness of the whole thing is often laughable. It is basically Hamlet in digital monkey costumes. A lot has been said about the ""performances"" of Serkis and Kebbell, and yes, the digital makeup looks convincing. They move like apes, they talk like apes might talk, but what else can you say of what the actors bring? Grunting out dramatic dialogue with a stern look on your face is not what makes a good performance. Unfortunately, it seems it's enough to fool audiences into thinking it is. Watching Serkis and Kebbell, I couldn't help but feel like I was being presented an effect; like the actors were trying to show me how much they could act under the digital makeup. Even with cutting edge special effects and big action set pieces, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was a crushing disappointment for me. The film had potential to takes us further into the ape-dominated world set up in Rise. Instead, the film coasts on the well-worn post-apocalyptic formula. Anything remotely interesting in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is killed by the frustratingly pretentious tone. The tone of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is relentlessly dark. Darkness is not a sin in itself, but director Matt Reeves lathers the drama and grittiness on so much that he forgets to entertain. Instead of simply taking the story seriously, the film takes itself seriously. Here is a group of people (Reeves, Serkis, etc.) who ""know"" that the movie they are making is an important Hollywood milestone. That is never good.That is the problem with the movie. It thinks it is a significant, world-changing drama about the nature of man, when in fact it is not. It's a glorified Last of Us ripoff, masquerading as a Shakespearian tragedy. The tone never wavers from the absolute dead serious. It's a shame because I loved the balance in tone that the Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes had. It was dark and scary, but it had real heart and the action was actually fun. I might not be the biggest apes fan, but what appeals to me about the series is its imagination, satire, and thrills, not wannabe high-brow crap like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.22/100",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It's worth to watch it though.13 minutes - yea, watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) first if you can, it looks like it is a proper sequel (same characters, not so long after the previous movie etc.), even though it was made by different director. It also feels much slower... at least for now.17 minutes - hooray! Gordon... I mean Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg... eh no, Stansfield! Damn it! I mean Gary Oldman! I love this guy! I hope it will be one of the main characters and they will show him a lot! There is also Miguel Alvarez from the Oz series :) 23 minutes - hahaha Gary already delivering his greatness + the movie really starts being interesting! 40 minutes - it is amazing how apes communicate and how it evolves 1h 20minutes - now that is brutal as hell... + the apes supposed to be smart...

227,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: Apes vs Humans,10,15 July 2014,"While the original Planet Of The Apes film did show that humans had been dominated by evolved apes, it did not have the same ominous tone that this film Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes brings to the franchise. This film paints a very real picture of the plausibility and the possibility of humans no longer being the dominant species. There was no need to waste time rehashing what took place in the predecessor film, so the telling of what had transpired during the opening credits left the entire film to address the task at hand; the fall of man. But, this film was so much more than a tale of how man fell, it delved into the dynamics of the father-son relationship, and how some wrongs can be so life altering that there's no coming back. This was an intelligently written, though provoking story that picks up roughly a decade after the apes flee into the forest. Caesar (Andy Serkis) now has a family including a rebellious son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and is leader to an enormous clan, which includes characters previously established. Maurice (Karin Konoval) the circus orangutan, Rocket (Terry Notary) the chimp- pimp, and Koba (Toby Kebbell) all of whom are living in unison until humans happen upon their home. This is the point where everyone's agenda begins to unfold, none clearer than Koba's whose disparaging past has completely marred him. He was the only character who had focused intentions, everyone else was somehow manipulated or unaware of the big picture that led to the human-ape clash, which caused me to sign with frustration several times throughout the film, which is my only issue with the story; the overwhelming naivete. I have focused primarily on the apes, but the humans do deserve some acknowledgement for attempting to avoid any further annihilation of the human race. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) was a good man who stepped way outside his comfort zone to fight for peaceful resolutions. Unfortunately, the cards were already stacked against them. I liken it to watching Titanic, you can hope that this time they will miss the iceberg, but it's inevitable. The special effects in today's cinematic world never cease to amaze me, what was done here is no exception. The apes were a given that they would be extremely lifelike, but to see how nature had ravaged civilization in such a relatively short time was a bit frightening. This was a very good film, from beginning to end. I enjoyed it immensely mostly because it made me feel some kind of way.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
228,bravesfanc,A great piece of story telling,8,13 July 2014,"The trailer for this movie made it look like an epic action movie where the apes were going to take on mankind. However while there ends up being a war started, that's not what makes this movie enjoyable. We pick up about 10 years after the events in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and we see that mankind is struggling to survive as most have died from a disease. On the opposite side, we see the apes and what they've created. Ceasar is their leader and they have built quite the foundation in the woods near the Golden Gate Bridge.Andy Serkis as Ceasar is simply brilliant. His motion capture acting might be the best in the business. Not only is it his motion and the way he moves but the dialogue as well. The special effects on all the apes is beyond great because you can tell what their emotions are. I think because of that, I liked it more than I thought I would.When it comes down to the big fight between ape and man, the action junkie inside me loved it. It was an essential part of the story and the way it is all started is very clever as well. At the end, it seems like there will be one more to this movie franchise and I can't wait.

229,JamesRutland,Excellent idea-MEDIOCRE direction,2,30 July 2014,"Unfortunately another Hollywood product as well as a further failure. They realized an excellent story full of good ideas but time-line doesn't let to develop them. So a story of 4 hours is cut to reach the usual standard time. Storyline defects: 1) events happen too fast, it's not natural; 2) events happen but they are not contextualized compared to the plot (example: 2 humans are in a military repository to test arms forwarded by human chief they are killed by an ape there is no consequence... these 2 men disappear from the story; another example: main human characters escape from apes citadel in the night leaded by some apes after Caesar fall, they are searching for Caesar in the morning (what happened between these 2 facts?). Another question concerns with logic: apes can infiltrate easily into human fortress as dark knight, but then they attack human enemies in front of from the ground(illogical: apes can infiltrate and attack on trees or palaces directly as shown). Movie lacks also of explanation about human fortress and apes citadel origin and description of them. Some scenes are ridiculous as human assemblage to celebrate energy since afternoon to night (the same scene in the same place all the time) till apes arrival. The movie appears to be fragmented and or cut from an event to another event sometime very dumb as if it has been made by a child. director inability? Hollywood poor standards!? Or both. I don't know exactly... what I know is that potentiality has been completely ruined. Man of steel falls almost in the same defect: too many events summarized in 2 hours.

That being said, the CGI is top-notch and the new cast was good, especially Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and Gary Oldman. I was underwhelmed with this film to be honest.

231,Doublej20005,A Great Sequel,8,13 March 2021,"A really great follow up that builds on what the first film set up, and still features fantastic effects, performances and action, even if they still haven't fixed some of the problems with the original. The big issue across these two films is that the human characters are very one-note and bland. Gary Oldman is the only complex human character in it - the rest just have one personality trait that is well explored, if that, and a lot of them make very stupid decisions. But on the flip side, Caesar is a fantastic character, and I really like how the apes' opinions on humans are affected directly by their experiences of them - it makes their characters a lot better. Andy Serkis is still fantastic, and the effects have aged very, very well. The action is really well shot, and has a really nice gritty feel, particularly in the second half. I will say that the first half was a tad slow for me, but I did appreciate how the film spent time building up the characters in order to go all out for the finale. The cinematography is strong and the story is well developed - those opening few minutes really pack a punch now. Overall, I wouldn't call this one of the best sequels of all time, but it is a genuinely great and recommendable film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
232,Hawkensian,Stunning CGI and compelling allegory makes Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a solid instalment.,7,25 July 2014,"Unlike a lot of summer blockbusters, there isn't much fun in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The film opens with a map sequence showing the spread of the Simian virus, it is a worryingly plausible and perhaps even prescient prelude to the film's nihilistic 130 minutes.Based in San Francisco, a group of virus resistant humans stumble upon the apes in a forest whilst locating a dam that's vital for the city's power supply. Carver (Kirk Acevedo), a trigger happy human, wounds an ape upon the surprise encounter, setting relations off to a uneasy start. Caeser (Andy Serkis), leader of the apes, eventually allows the humans to work on the dam on the strict condition that they surrender their weapons.This collaboration makes Koba (Toby Kebbell) rather apprehensive. Koba, a bonobo, has suffered at the hands of humans, developing an intense hatred for them. While Caesar is wary of humans and acts very much in the interest of his fellows apes, he recognises the humans' capacity for good, something that frustrates and disillusions Koba to the point of rebellion.Immediately the film impresses with its motion capture, seldom am I compelled by CGI characters like I was by Caeser, Koba and the scores of other primates. The range of chimps, gorillas, orangutans and bonobos are effortlessly brought to life through superlative animation and great physical performances.The Homo sapiens of the film are, on the other hand, somewhat unremarkable and one dimensional – they're all disposable save for a few. However, both the humans and apes have members whose existence are purely narrative function, they each serve identical purposes, it's a rather simple construct. Caeser, the hyper-intelligent Chimpanzee who is stern but fair with his colony and the humans he encounters, has a clear equivalent in Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the human leader who also favours peace and cooperation.These two leaders are beacons of appeasement and democracy, however both sides are jeopardised by bigoted brutes. The aforementioned Carver and Koba assume these roles, both have a tendency for violence and predilection for martial law, however Koba has a much more sinister influence in the colony. Gary Oldman's character Dreyfus, a senior member of the humans, is also a counterpart of Koba's, however I found Carver to be more zealous in his contempt.There is a slight narrative sag about half way through the film, however this break in momentum is swiftly fixed when the embittered, war- mongering Koba orchestrates a full scale conflict with the humans. The film then becomes an interesting allegory for war, racism and genocide. With scenes of humans being herded into cages and brutal punishment for dissent amongst the ranks, clear correlations can be made between Koba's colony and Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, Stalin's USSR and the slew of other hideous regimes of history.Generally, the film is to be commended for its anthropomorphic balance. I liked how for the majority of the time the apes communicated using sign language as opposed to just English. Speaking English is biologically impossible for apes, however I'm willing to believe that this isn't necessarily true in the film's universe. What I'm not willing to believe is that chimpanzees can shed tears, they can't, it is a human function that's unique among primates. Also, there are instances in which the apes, chiefly Caesar, bear facial expressions or engage in conversations that are just too human and complex. Thankfully, the anthropomorphism is seldom sentimental.Although character development is familiar and predictable, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is ultimately a spectacle packed nihilistic summer blockbuster about instinct, politics, racism and war. 78%www.hawkensian.com",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
233,vistheindian,Hail Caesar!,8,22 July 2014,"Quickie Review:Caesar (Andy Serkis), the first of the genetically evolved apes leads a new society of his own kind. Now a decade after a deadly virus outbreak, the surviving humans threaten the existence of the apes' way of living. For mutual benefit of apes and humans a truce is struck, but there are those in both races that believe only one of them can be the dominant species of Earth. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (DotPotA) is one those movies that blends blockbuster action and intelligent drama almost perfectly. Technologically, this movie is truly revolutionary in capturing the characters behind the motion capture for the apes. Story telling wise, it is packed with great emotional depth, personality, and relevant social commentary. This is no doubt one of the best movies of this summer.Full Review:DotPotA was definitely one of my most anticipated movies of 2014, especially after the brilliance of Andy Serkis's performance as Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. I must say the movie delivered in all that I wanted. There few things that irked me, but in the end it did not deter me from my enjoyment of the movie.The crown jewel of DotPotA is of course Andy Serkis's Caesar. It is already known that this man is a genius when it comes to bringing emotion to a motion capture animated character, and he continues to give the incredible performance in this sequel. There are times you might even forget that Caesar is an ape, because of how subtle in his delivery and believable as a character he is (yes, a talking ape is believable). He brings this presence in every scene that demands your full attention. There is one new addition to the cast that took me by surprise, and easily is one of the highlights, that is Toby Kebbell as the ape Koba. An ape that has been mistreated by humans all his life, Koba only holds anger and hatred for all of human kind. And Kebbell does a great job of making us understand where the character is coming from, even when he goes about hatching devious and morally questionable plans. Let me remind you, both Kebbell and Serkis are achieving this with only sign language and the most primitive of spoken languages.I also like the world created, a decade after the viral outbreak. You get to see how the apes are evolving their society. They seems to have traditions, schools, and a real culture. So fans of the original Planet of the Apes, will enjoy seeing the genesis of the ape society. The city of San Francisco is now overgrown by nature, it seems like it must be deafening silence walking through those once bustling streets. Meantime the humans seem to have pulled together in these ruins and built a functioning community. The story was actually unpredictable. I thought I knew what to expect, how the plot will unfold, based on the trailers, but thankfully I was very wrong. This is the reason I won't go into the story but rest assured you will like what you see.Finally, this brings me to the things that I didn't like to see. So much care was put into the story telling and bringing out the personality of the digital apes, but I have to admit I was unimpressed by the effort put into the human cast. Sure they were functional, but considering how great every other aspect of the movie was, I was surprised by how stereotypical the human characters were. There is so much exposition given on each human, you know exactly what that person is going to do in the movie. Yes the story is unpredictable, but the actions of the humans weren't. It even got to the point where the cast was literally telling the ""a**hole"" character that he is the a**hole guy. Don't tell us, show us. Actions speak louder than words.In the end, I was able to ignore that one flaw and enjoy the movie as a whole. I am definitely going to watch this another time just to see Caesar be awesome. Overall I loved this movie, and you'd be missing out if you don't go watch it.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
234,CowherPowerForever,"And I want you to know, it's not just about power! It's about giving us the hope to rebuild, to reclaim the world we lost!",10,16 July 2014,"The following review will contain some light spoilers. So if you do not want to hear anything about this film, then it would be best not to read my review.Three years after the release of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, comes one of the greatest sequels ever made. Not only should it be considered one of the best sequels ever, but I strongly think this may be one of the greatest films ever. The story is so flawless, and then executed perfectly by director Matt Reeves, that it will have you interest and even leave you wanting more. This is my review of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.This sequel was written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver. Jaffa and Silver both wrote Rise of the Planet of the Apes, while Bomback worked on films like The Wolverine and Total Recall(2012). To be honest, I was very worried about this story taking place in the future, because I thought it would take away a lot of the much needed details. Surprisingly I left the theater without any worries about that aspect at all. They were able to craft such a perfect story around the distant future that filling in the middle didn't seem just. The movie moves along perfectly, although my only real complaint of this film is the pacing towards the end of the film. It felt very sticky and lost a little glow over the first half of the film. Not to say that makes the film unwatchable or anything, it just doesn't move along as nicely towards the end. The film overall is heavily character driven. A lot of the action appears towards the end of the film. This just ends up working perfectly as we follow Caesar(from the first film) and his followers and family. Over time as Caesar is tested once again by the humans, he is also tested by another ape, Koba(Toby Kebbell). The story here is simply fabulous. The film may seem like it moves slow to those who aren't into character driven films, but for someone like me, it was great. I won't go into full details of the story, but I will leave you with this, if you want a truly amazing story, this is the best movie to choose for the year of 2014.Matt Reeves sits in the director's chair in this installment. Rupert Wyatt who directed the first film did not return, and while I loved that movie he did, this was a step up in my opinion. Matt Reeves is widely known for directing the massive hit Cloverfield. This is a completely different type of film, but he dominates the film. As I mentioned above, there really isn't a lot of action until the latter part of the film, but when the action heats up it is shot perfectly. Mostly done with CG, everything works amazingly. The CG doesn't feel overdone and tacky. Some of the high rise shots of San Francisco are amazing to watch as it is set in a future where disease ruined the world, and are probably even better on large format screens, if you are lucky enough to watch this film in that format. Andy Serkis is back again to play the likable Caesar, but there are new faces this time around. Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, and Gary Oldman are all new additions and they all play a fantastic role in this film. Oldman as we all know is an amazing actor, and the same goes for this film as well. Clarke, who is becoming a bigger star recently, really holds his own as the lead character along with Kerri Russell. While I don't see Russell winning any wards, her performance is solid. As I mentioned Andy Serkis is back as Caesar, and actors like him do not get enough credit. Hopefully that will change with films like this. He was yet again perfect in his role in the motion capture department, and actually gets more lines this time around. So, big thumps up for the acting and directing in this film.Michael Giacchino provides the score for this film. He recently worked on Star Trek Into Darkness, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, and even worked with Matt Reeves on Cloverfield. his score in this film is nothing short of breathtaking. For fans of scores, like I am, this will leave you feeling the film as much better. He doesn't overdue it like some composers tend to do, and his handling of this film should be considered for a few awards.Overall this is easily one of the best films I have ever watched, while some may not be into this type of character driven film that could be slow in your eyes, people with movie tastes like me should leave the theater feeling very satisfied. This is a must watch, and while I didn't watch this film in 3D, with great CG work, and being filmed with 3D in mind, you probably can't go work. Again, one of the best sequels ever made, and easily in my top films list.9.7/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
235,moviemattb,Best one since the original 1968 movie,10,14 July 2014,"This review will not contain any spoilers. After seeing all the Planet of the Apes movies, this one, in my opinion, is the best one since the original 1968 movie. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a pretty good movie, but I love this one more. The special effects in this movie are a big step up from ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" which I thought they are very well detailed and not coming on and off (I explain about the effects from ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" for another time). Andy Serkis has given such an incredible performance for his role as Caesar for him speaking and not speaking. The rest of cast like Gary Oldman, and such all do their jobs well enough; but its really Apes that steals most of the movie because they are the stars. I thought Matt Reeves did a pretty darn good for directing the movie, since I knew him as a director for another movie he is well known for known as ""Cloverfield."" The story was well told, and I thought the premise did kept me interest and does not come off being side track from having a subplot or anything that takes away from the entire movie. If you haven't seen it, check it out! I give it a 10 out of 10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
236,japamo,Meet the New SpeciesSame as the Old Species,10,8 June 2015,"Chimpanzees' and other primates' image as mischievous, comical, banana-loving cut-ups has been shattered. As recent studies have established, primates share at least 98% of our genetic code and also share humankind's penchant for killing and eating meat and violently squabbling with others for food, mates, and even territory. Add to that the fact that the average chimp is at least five times stronger than the average man, and you realize that the post-apocalyptic simian society portrayed by ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (hereafter ""Dawn"") may not be an acid-trip fantasy at all. It just may be an imminent terrifying reality. Maybe those who advocate granting (or have even already granted) chimps and orangutans full-fledged protected human status should reconsider.""Dawn"" begins 10 years after the end of ""Rise of The Planet of the Apes"" (hereafter ""Rise"") after the mentally-enhanced apes led by Caesar (motion captured again by Andy Serkis) fled San Francisco to the safety of the Muir Woods (replayed in a montage at the beginning of the film). They have established a basic treetop village society, subsist largely on deer, and, though capable of speech, mostly communicate by sign language. An epidemic simian flu has eradicated the human race – or so the apes believe since they haven't seen a single human in 10 years. However, when a human hunting party stumbles upon a small group of apes and one shoots and wounds an ape named Ash (Doc Shaw), the apes investigate San Francisco's semi-decayed ruins and realize a sizable group of human still survive, led by rational, conciliatory, peace-seeking leader Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and more impulsive, belligerent, and ape-loathing leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman).The reason apes and men have mutually avoided each other is because San Francisco has had enough fuel supplies to support a quasi-civilized existence. But the fuel supply will be depleted within 3 weeks and the only source of alternative power is an electric dam situated in ape territory. Malcolm and his wife Ellie (Keri Russell) a former CDC nurse and her son by another father, the artistic Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) manage to gain an audience with the deeply distrustful Caesar to get permission to re-start the dam, which Caesar grudgingly grants, provided they finish within 3 days and bring no weapons. Malcolm complies.Just as the sensible, ""live and let live"" Malcolm and Caesar complement each other, vengeful, reckless Dreyfus finds a match in Koba, a confidant to Caesar, and a fiery, bitter, aggressive human-hater because of the painful experiments to which human scientists subjected him. So, paralleling Malcolm's and Caesar's efforts at a truce and détente, and even Alex's literary relationship with the orangutan instructor Maurice (Karin Konoval), is Koba's efforts to prove to Caesar that the humans cannot be trusted. And in one of his forays into the city, Koba finds just that proof – an armory stockpiled with guns, ammunition, and war machines. Nevertheless, Caesar continues to trust Malcolm, so Koba dangerously takes control of things by first shooting and apparently killing Caesar.He then learns to strong-arm and intimidate some followers to grab some of the guns and launch an assault at the human refuge (the former stock exchange, I think) to kill and enslave both humans and apes sympathetic to humans. Koba then ensconces himself within a tower. Fortunately, Koba only wounded Caesar; Malcolm and Ellie locate him and dress his injuries and help Caesar's wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) recover from giving birth to Milo. They even manage to free Koba's prisoners (both ape and human) and regroup at Caesar's childhood home in ""Rise"". Malcolm agrees to buy Caesar time to confront Koba at the tower, but Dreyfus has installed plastic explosives within the tower. Also, since the dam has successfully powered up, Dreyfus's gang has even managed to establish contact with the outside world – namely a military base up north ready to fly down and help. Can Caesar reconcile with Koba and keep the fragile peace? Or have Dreyfus's and Koba's shameful actions doomed everybody?""Dawn"", in its blatant but still sober and powerfully effective way, demonstrates the chaos that ensues when anyone (human or ape) abandons reason, harmony, brotherhood and diplomacy and gets caught up in fearful, deadly intolerance. ""Dawn"" magnifies this intolerance through its use by Dreyfus and Koba, whose fear and vengeance have caused indiscriminate death and brought them below the lowest human or ape. In Koba's case it is even worse because, as both ""Rise"" and ""Dawn"" argue, the primates were poised to supersede and be better than the humans because, as one of Malcolm's supporters comments, they combine human intelligence with their natural agility and strength that don't need energy sources and other human comforts. Caesar thought so, too. But with Koba's fall, Caesar grimly admits how alike humans and apes, for better and worse, really are. So when we witness the fires, explosions, attacks, shootings, and assaults both humans and apes in ""Dawn"" commit, we might be exhilarated, but we shouldn't. Instead, we should be sad at a mutually lost opportunity.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
237,drew_atreides,Continues the surprisingly well-made prequel series!,9,11 July 2014,"... i have to say i was stunned by how good of a film the original RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES turned out being..I went into that one with no expectations, and came out quite impressed. I went into Dawn, now, WITH expectations and the film does not disappoint. There is great action, to be sure, but action can't really truly matter without solid storytelling and characters, and that is here in spades. Its amazing to me how every member of the ape family has a distinct personality. Despite very little speech, you get a real understanding of what motivates these characters, and you become emotionally invested.There are no good guys or bad guys. You understand the prejudices of both sides, and that makes for great storytelling!I can't wait for the next entry in this series.Bravo!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
238,mitchell5954,My Favorite Planet of the Ape Film!,10,17 July 2017,"Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the year and is definitely superior to the previous movie. Rise of The Planet of The Apes, while a good movie, did come off as a bit too simplistic, contrived, and black and white. It also felt a little to derivative. I felt like I have been here before. The CG, while good overall, looked a bit off at times. Fortunately Dawn has none of these things. With this film, it is clear, they have learned from their mistakes.This film takes place at least a decade after the previous film. The majority of humanity has been wiped out by the virus set-up in Rise. There some survivors. The ones we focus on is a small colony in San Francisco. We also follow Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his colony of apes as we see how they have thrived since the previous movie and have formed society of their own. Soon the two groups meet and the tension begins to rise. Now Caesar and the main human, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), and his family try to avoid all-out war.This film is near perfect, if not perfect. The cinematography is amazing. This is a beautiful looking film. The CGI is flawless, and is much better than in Rise. I also love the action scenes. The only action scene in Rise is at the end on the bridge. Here there is much more action and it's done beautifully. I also like how this film doesn't take any lines or story elements from the original franchise like Rise did, and stood as its own piece.The characters are good too. I like the main human characters. They weren't especially interesting, but I didn't dislike any of them either. Caesar and the apes are definitely what make this film. I especially love Caesar's rivalry with another ape named Koba. I also like Caesar's relationship with his son and how that is resolved.I also enjoyed the story this time around. I like how Caesar and Malcom are constantly trying to maintain peace while there others in both camps who want war and will what it takes to start it. I also like how the film doesn't really take a side here. In Rise it is clear you are supposed to side with the apes and that the humans are bad. Every human in that film besides James Franco's character is portrayed as narrow-minded, ignorant, bullies, or just stereo-typically evil. This film could have easily gone that route, but, thankfully, they didn't. Here there is a balance. There are bad humans but there are also bad apes who want to exterminate humans. I like how this film not so black and white says that the apes can be just as bad as the humans instead of just siding with either the humans or the apes.Overall, if you are a fan of Planet of The Apes, want to see a good summer movie, or just want to see a good film in the theater than this is a must see. I recommend watching Rise of The Planet of The Apes first if you haven't. Even if you do not like that film I still say to give this a watch.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
239,irishboy141,A classic tale told brilliantly,9,4 December 2018,"After the really good Rise, comes the great Dawn.The film picks up 10 years after Rise. Humans come into conflict with the apes because the dam humans need for power is inside the Apes territory.

Jason Clarke, Keri Russel, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and Gary Oldman are really good.

241,cattjones,Great Graphics; Great Story,9,14 July 2014,"I went to see this film in 3D, which was not worth it; however that was the only negative thing that I have to say about it. As a side note, I did get to see the trailer for The Guardians of the Galaxy in 3D and that one looks like it will be worth it. This film proved to communicate two distinct points; one, that there is always at least one bad seed in the bunch and two; dealing with kids can be a handful. Once again Andy Serkis (Caesar) made you believe that he was more than a man plugged into a green screen. The believability in his movement and expressions makes you realize that maybe he has attained a PhD in character acting. Brilliant! There are always a couple of folks that would rather fight than work for peace; and no, I'm not talking about the Republican Party (smile). Gary Oldman (Dreyfus), who did not really want the war in the beginning, had no issues jumping right in the middle of things when it did get started. Then there was Kirk Acevedo (Carver); he is the idiot that you will definitely love to hate. It is always the characters that have the most fear that seem to do most of the damage. Speaking of which, Toby Kebbell (Koba) had the task of filling that role on the opposite side of the house. I just didn't know what to say about this guy, but I was not surprised since he was the one with the most anger (and rightly so) from the last Planet of the Apes film. The humans that wondered into Ape territory, Jason Clark (Malcolm), Keri Russell (Elle) and their son Kodi Smit-McPhee (Alexander), quickly became the ambassadors for any good that was still left on the human side of the house. I thought that the film ran at a pretty steady pace and although there were no ""OMG"" moments, it was still a really good story. I do have to say that there may be ""OMG"" moments for younger viewer who did not grow up with the apes like folks from my generation did. Of course there will be another ""Planets"" film, which I am looking forward to just to see the evolution of Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) if nothing else. This is definitely a film worth seeing on the big screen, just save the 3D up charge.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
242,ahegde3149,"""How much like them we are""",7,21 November 2014,"10 years after the events of 'Rise of Planet of Apes' got over, the events of 'Dawn of Planet of Apes' follow. We saw that some virus originates causing an epidemic called simian flu spread across the globe during the closing credits of the previous installment. The same events are show in the opening credits of this one. Most of the humans on the earth's surface are wiped out and few who are alive seem to be somehow immune to the virus. While the apes lead by Caesar have established a new home in the forest and growing in population day by day. The group of human survivors need a dam to be back in operation so that they get electricity but the problem is it lies close to the ape territory. And there the differences on both sides start to begin.Caesar played by Andy Serkis(motion-capture) is definitely my favorite character from both Rise and Dawn. His character is well written and Andy Serkis has done a marvelous job. Despite knowing nature of Humans he still is sure not every human is bad. While in the other camp of humans, people are panicking as the apes are smarter than ever and feel threatened. Gary Oldman isn't at his best but does his job. But its Jason Clarke as Malcolm who is more likable. The bond between Malcolm and Caesar that slowly and strongly develops is one of the strongest points in the film. Also other positive includes, the tension that builds up on each side on the slightest doubt against each other.The CGI and motion capture is also top notch. The post-apocalyptic environment is quite haunting and effects on apes are damn good. Its doesn't not look perfectly realistic but still one of the best works in recent times. The weak point of the film is it gets quite predictable and towards the end turns into routine action flick filled explosions and more CGI. Also some plot advancements might not make much sense,but its bearable. The ultimate point of film in my opinion is that no one perfect on either side, which is the main cause of misunderstanding. Humans are always feel threatened when they see something far advanced while apes are afraid of humans destroying their species like they destroyed earth. One point where Caesar says ""I always think ape better than human. I see now, how much like them we are."", kept me thinking about our nature for quite some time.Dawn is way different movie compared to Rise. So if you liked the first one because it featured a playful pet-ape Caesar than don't expect same thing here. But still despite its flaws Dawn of the Planet of Apes is strong movie with good intellectual and emotional depth. Only if they did not make it feel like a blockbuster action flick in the second half it would have been pretty much betterRATING: [3.5/5]",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

As a sequel to 'Rise' it feels completely different on a whole but referencing its roots enough to stay in keeping. It doesn't have a lot of action but when it does it feels epic and the effects are top drawer. The storytelling is where this movie excels, its an imaginative spin to the original movie and has some beautiful moments. This movie has the ability to make you gasp which is terrific, at times when it should feel silly in hindsight it just works effortlessly. The tempo of this movie does rely heavily on the other party not knowing something, throwing back and fourth using the same technique although this does not take away from the overall breath taking entertainment.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

With all the good reviews and people raving about this film however, I thought well I'll give this franchise another shot, and boy was it worth it. This film is far superior to Rise in my view. There are a few parts that could have been done better here; But mainly this film is very solid writing wise and very entertaining. The film develops it's characters, especially many of the apes far better than most action films these days as well. The lead up to war here is done extremely well for the most part.

There goes the hollyweird machine again even when they personify the hero chimps they have to throw Caucasian elements in there. Smh.The human cast was boring and just plain weird. Very disjointed. There was the concerned father along with his tortured son and then the nurse/surgeon girlfriend, and the token black guy who had exactly one line and the hateful guy who blamed the apes for everything.I have no idea why Gary Oldman took part in this mess of project.

The sequels only got crazier (and worse), and once time travel got involved, you knew that it had to stop. Then in 2011, the series got a much-needed fresh start with Rise. And now the sequel is finally here, and it is quite possibly the best film in the entire eight-film series. During the credits of Rise, there was a little sequence involving the implied spread of a virus known as the simian flu. By Dawn, that virus has all but destroyed the world, reducing the human population to around a tenth of what it once was. In San Francisco, the human colony there is running out of power, and asks the apes to allow access to the nearby dam, thus allowing the two sides to live separately, but peacefully. Of course, it's never that easy. Due to a string of events which I will not spoil here, the good acting, phenomenal visual effects, precise direction, and almost-Shakespearean script come together in a smart, visceral blockbuster that will surely be remembered as one of 2014's best films.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It looks very realistic. The ape home in Muir woods is also a great set. The set designers and CGI graphic department are top candidates for the Texy Award in special effects this year. Good: The film makers got us to actually care about CGI apes, mostly. And the relationship between Caesar and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) is well portrayed. Okay: the CGI of the apes is pretty darn good, except for the child chimp. It looks too jumpy and cartoonish. The apes on horse looked great, however. The acting is fairly good as well. Keri Russell as Ellie, Malcolm's partner, didn't suck. I guess I should mention Gary Oldman. Done. Okay, but with issues: The basic story. The plot is okay, but it's a bit predictable. The story does bring up themes of trust, biology, evolution, anger and forgiveness in a mostly thoughtful way. Both the apes and humans have ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" in their midst. That is at once refreshing, there are no clearly good or evil groups as in Star Wars, but it is also a bit cliché. The dialogue is sometimes excellent, but it is also often unintentionally campy. Not good: The family scenes when Caesar's child is born is straight out of a Disney wildlife special. It's cloying and overly sentimental. The Music: In the beginning it is overly dramatic, as if the film itself wasn't dramatic enough. I was worried they had hired John Williams and his musical pomposity. The music got better, but it wasn't great. Rating: Matinée. It was entertaining without too many faults, and what else can you expect from a Planet of the Ape film?

248,AbhiMathews,The Age Old Tale,7,21 July 2014,"Humans generally have a superiority complex that makes them often consider all other forms of life as inadequate. Civilization has exemplified the mass exploitation and selfishness humans are capable of in the past, and present, on numerous occasions. The Planet of the Apes series delves on this complex. It displays the vulnerabilities of the human race and how nothing is to be underestimated.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will surely entertain. As the sequel to the last instalment, we follow Caesar in his new habitat following the human pandemic instigated by the Simian influenza. In a world where the human population is depleted and infrastructure collapsed, society is broken apart and in a fragile state. With stubborn and selfish humans, the fate of humanity does not rest in good hands. Watching this film, I cannot say there ever was a moment of dullness nor boredom. Though, for me, there was nothing exceptional about it. The plot is one that we have come to expect and the CGI was certainly state of the art. Putting this aside, it is the story of Caesar and the strive for freedom of all that captures this movie's true essence. Empathizing with these intelligent beings no longer being the tools of humans is one to both support and fear. It is this unique mixture of elements that make Dawn of the Planet of the Apes so touching yet stimulating.This is a movie I'd recommend all to see since it offers a perspective many contemporary films fail to produce.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
249,YJLcool,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is truly a cinematic masterpiece.,9,12 July 2014,"After the 2011 sci-fi action drama hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which is a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series, the story continues further in the sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. This film is not just an epic story that's about the conflict between humans and apes, but it's also a gripping and emotional story that strongly reflects on our society and civilization as a whole.The first act of the film is simply remarkable. 10 years after the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes where Caesar freed the evolved apes, we get to see how the apes form a colony. They established a society, much like us, but living in peace and harmony. They went on hunting together and communicate with each other mostly with their hands (sign language and sounds). On the other hand, humans are almost completely wiped out by the ALZ-113 virus spread (Simian flu) and become a minority. But, everything starts to change, conflicts start to arise when the humans accidentally found the apes during a small expedition to start up an old hydroelectric dam to re-power the city with lights.The film shows how the two different cultures (man and ape) gradually clash...how a series of small acts of violence, betrayal of trust or personal acts of aggression can incite a catastrophic war in which neither side truly ""wins"". Rather than spoonfeeding the audience with heavy expositions, the film lets the characters draw you into the story, slowly in each moment until you begin to see the real world parallels that exist throughout the history of mankind.The CGI with motion capture in this film is superb and top-notch. The motion capture actors (Andy Serkis as Caesar, Toby Kebbell as Koba, Karin Konoval as Maurice, Nick Thurston as Blue Eyes, Doc Shaw as Ash, Terry Notary as Rocket) did a fantastic performance and managed to imbue the apes with various emotions: anger, fear, happiness, regret, heartbreak, sadness, frustration, hatred, love, etc. All of the apes look real and lifelike that you think of them as characters with distinctive personalities. These apes live, breathe, think and feel, just like us.Each main character in the film has strong, understandable reasoning for what they're doing. They all try to protect their own people, in their own way. Caesar, the wise ape leader who desires peace for his people, constantly tries to show strength in his leadership in order to achieve it. On the other hand, Malcolm, the human lead, tries to understand the apes, work out their differences without discrimination, in hopes that peace can be maintained as well. Koba, the film's antagonist, much like Caesar, is different compared with the rest of the apes...He has seen the worst side of humanity (unlike Caesar, who has seen the best side of humanity). Dreyfus, the human leader (his shout ""They're animals!"") and many of his peers show their discrimination and contempt for the apes due to their own personal reasons.The film tries to show different character perspectives from both sides, their own fears. The truth is no matter how hard both sides trying to justify it, they are both wrong. They believe what they're doing is ultimately right...for the safety of their own people. Despite their best intentions, these people and apes can be easily corrupted when they have a gun placed in their hands. It also shows how fear and hatred can lead anyone do the wrong things...how dictatorships are born, which echoes our actual history. It's a cynical depiction of nature of men through apes. It eerily shows the horrors of our society that exist even today.Throughout the film, Caesar constantly shows the best of humanity, but sadly his family of apes end up with the worst parts of human nature. By the end of the film, you can feel Caesar's regret, sadness and heartbreak...which is both moving and thought-provoking at the same time. In short, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It's a sequel with a strong purpose and socio-political message. This film reminds us why we go to the movies. It's certainly one of the best films of the year! Two thumbs-up! Very highly recommended.Rating: 9.5/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/07/",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
250,SpoodermanDerp,Apes bring Sci-fi to a whole new world,9,12 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an example of how rich Sci-Fi movies have come to be. Dawn takes place a decade after the events of Rise, the simian plague has reached through out the world and we come to see the situation of the remaining humans. Apes, however, are home to their forest wherein Caesar (played by Andy Serkis) is the leader. Earth is a frightening apocalyptic world for the humans, we are then introduced to Dreyfus (played by Gary Oldman) and his group of survivors as they are struggling especially when an accident occurs that may lead to a war between the Apes.Dawn is a definitive sequel and gladly takes you to the edge of your seat in it's 2 hour run time. The writing and pacing is great, unexpected sequences are handled well. There are moments where scenes feel calm, but in a matter of seconds these are changed with startling outcomes. The movie depicts realism. It gives emotional and sometimes heart-breaking scenes, both in the human and ape side.The CGI was unnoticeable. Not in a bad way, but rather in a good way. CGI was remarkably executed in the film. There were moments where I forgot it was just a bunch of CGI apes everywhere instead, I thought they were real live apes. I have a feeling Godzilla won't win the Best Visual Effects Oscar next year, Apes might just bring it home. The CGI wasn't the only thing that made the Apes great. This film did what Transformers films failed to do with their auto bots. The Apes had depth and character, they had feelings and they also felt very human, I actually cared and sympathized for Caesar and his apes, unlike the feeling I get towards the auto bots in Bay's Transformers films.The non-human characters were the stand outs of this film, especially Caesar. He has evolved and become a leader who will do anything for the freedom and peace of the apes. Malcolm (played by Jason Clarke) and his wife Ellie (played by Keri Russell) gave quite good performances, same goes with Gary Oldman. But they were shadowed by Andy Serkis' remarkable and unforgettable performance as Caesar. The fact that he hasn't won an Oscar, is unbelievable, he stole every moment in the movie whenever he is on screen. Koba (played by Toby Kebbell) was also remarkable, a very unforgettable antagonist, he reminded me of The Winter Soldier in Captain America although Koba was more menacing than ever. The action sequences were not the typical ones you see in modern blockbusters to date. First of all it was a battle between Apes and Humans, how the apes were handled in the action are rather different and it comes to a point where it feels realistic. The cinematography fits well to the action as well. I could barely remember a scene which was difficult to watch. The music fits perfectly in the movie, whenever action or suspense kicks in the musical score swells in beautifully.However, the movie still has it's flaw. The movie starts quite slowly, and there are quite boring scenes. Those were only in the first act, therefore it is a build up for the Second Act and Third Act which were the outstanding parts in the movie.Dawn is a step for the Sci-Fi movie genre. It's realism and symbolism to the real world is well received. So far this is the best movie of the great consecutive blockbusters of 2014. It sets the standards for sequels of movies, and how sequels or remakes can have so much potential. I am indeed very excited to see the next sequel and how this may tie up to the Planet of the Apes film. With it's top notch visuals. Scenes that bring you to the edge of your seat. Amazing acting which brought life to the apes. Breath taking sequences that will be sure to startle you. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes delivers an intelligent and well rounded blockbuster that I would recommend anyone to watch.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
251,moviescoundrel,Better than the First,8,15 July 2014,"I had moderately high expectations for this film based on early critical consensus, which was about 90 percent favorable. Was hoping for possibly a ESB epiphany. Not so much with the epiphany but it definitely overshadowed the first ""Apes"" movie. Although the human characters are a bit lacking even though I enjoy the actors most of the time, this is not their movie. From the beginning, this is the ape's movie. It is their characters that are riveting and you find yourself caring about. Their plot and intrinsic motivations that actually matter. The special effects here are amazing to the point that most of the time you are watching the film like you would any other movie with human characters, only that more than half of the characters are CGI apes. I was hoping for a bit more action I must say. Based on the previews, we know there is a battle coming. It is inevitable. Watching it unfold and the meddling humans and apes that try and mess things up to make this happen is alright. The battle then occurs and is good but done in about 10 minutes. Cue plot twists, and some decent character drama from the leaders of the respective groups who want to do the right thing and keep the peace. The rest of the film is spent watching the protagonists try and make this happen, and there are some pretty emotional and suspenseful parts.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
252,georgecoffeynewyorker,HATED Subtitles,9,18 July 2014,"Well I was quite taken to the film. At times, I would agree with one of my mates reaction in which he said that people were seen leaving the film, cause that actually happened tonight as well at my screening I was at. The plot was basic Human V Apes. However that was twisted, hence I got slightly lost. But got back on the band wagon. In that at the beginning of the film, the film introduces parts from the first part of the sequel: The Rise of the Planet of the Apes. We are then treated with Caesar;s face from his eye balls then it is revealed to be that of Caesar when the camera zooms OUT. Caesar's face at the end is zoomed IN into the opposite direction. I did get a bit of a heartwarming drama from it. But Emotional, my friend beside me was blubbering. I seam to have lost the plot if that's the case. hahaah. It is then found that Kobo betrays Caesar and frames the Humans. But Caesar knows the truth BUT not the other Apes YET. Eventually a battles ensues. One thing that really bothered me thou was the SUBTITLES. The Apes should have been able to speak CONSTANTLY. Like they did actually speak, but at times, they didn't. THAT I DID NOT LIKE.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
253,JohnnyPHreak,A heartfelt sequel that shines in so many ways,9,11 July 2014,"I'm not a Planet of the Apes fan. I never have been. I've only really seen the first original film and maybe a few episodes of the TV show. I always thought it was a bit corny in my book. But I understand the sci- fi nostalgia of it. It never appealed to me. I was kind of happy the first remake failed. I have lost a lot of faith in Tim Burton and the film just looked awful. When Rise came out there was so much negativity surrounding it. The news of re-shoots and James Franco distancing himself from the film wasn't inviting. I had no plan on seeing it for a long time. But it was a hit. Even with the die hard fans it was winning approval. I didn't see it until it was on demand. The film shocked me. I was sucked into this emotional story in a big sci-fi reboot/remake. The effects were awesome, Franco's character was appealing but it was the work of Andy Serkis and WETA making me feel for the apes. I was so pleasantly surprised I shouted from the hills that people needed to see it. I had heard that there was a second film coming and I was pleasantly happy about it. But I remember saying that they need to keep the director and the emotion of the first film. One of those two happened. Matt Reeves took over the helm for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and it's nothing but positive. This sequel is bigger and even more emotional than the first. The film takes place ten years later. That is shown in a very haunting and close to home opening sequence. The apes haven't seen humans in two years. A small gathering of humans have ventured out to find a dam where they can start the power for the city of San Francisco. This leads to much that I don't want to give away. There's so much emotion in this film. For the first twenty minutes or so we are treated to the apes life they have built. It's gorgeous, beautiful and will easily take any viewer and place them in this new world. Honestly, WETA has done such a great job with the apes in the film the whole film could have been about them and I would have been just as invested. Andy Serkis' performance as Ceasar is outstanding. In this film his character is now middle aged with a family of his own. He is the leader of the group of apes and with all that on his plate the humans emerge. It's a gripping performance with so much nuance. I'll be shocked if he doesn't get some kind of nomination. Every one of the apes in a main role including Toby Kebbell as his right hand Koba are excellent. Jason Clarke is great as the main human in the film trying to also preserve life for his family. But each of the human characters give enough to keep a good balance in the picture. Gary Oldman is good but his appearance in the film has been greatly exaggerated. It's more like an extended cameo. This is one of those films that in the world of big dumb box office hits keeps everything intelligent. There's nothing here that makes the audience feel dumb. Along with the sci-fi element and the action scenes this film does great to convey thoughts of gun control. It's so refreshing to see a film tackle some hard topics in a big tent pole feature. Matt Reeves will be the next IT director because of this film. The look, the feel, the performances and the way the film is shot screams ""I have serious talent"". He has now proved he can do the small film (Cloverfield) and the big budget summer films. I can't wait to see where he goes for the third film in the series. Being the nerd I am I have trouble changing my views on certain topics. But I never thought in the same year I would change my thoughts on two big nerd staples. First was my finally coming to terms with my love of X-Men after seeing Days of Future Past. Now comes my complete change in thought about Planet of the Apes. It could just be Matt Reeves direction and Serkis' performance but this is the second sequel that takes everything about the first one and grows it. Instead of just banking on the name the filmmakers, cast and crew throw their heart and souls to make a not just a better film, a great film. Nice to see that some people haven't given up on the intelligence of the film audience.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
254,sohansurag,By far the best movie of 2014,9,15 September 2014,"When I first saw the trailer for Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I remember posting a Facebook status: ""Slap the word 'Rise' to a franchise and make a reboot out of it"". Little did i know that it'd be one of my favorite movies of the year. The movie was a brilliant reboot for the franchise especially considering what Tim Burton had done to it way back in 2001. Rise Of Planet Of The Apes told the story of Caesar the Ape and how he started an Ape Revolution and the movie also ended setting up everything for a sequel.Enter Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, and when you are done with pronouncing the overlong title, the movie picks up the story after a decade or so from the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, most of the human population had perished due to the Simian Flu and Caesar has started his own herd, his own family deep inside the woods. Going in for Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, I had no clue what was in store for me, the opening scene itself blew me away and I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. While Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes was for the most part commercial and pleasant, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is definitely dark it gives out that grim feeling. The story is well crafted and leaves no room for a single speck of boredom. If you were someone like me, I am sure you would have tried to piece together a sense of story from the previews but believe me, the movie goes nothing like you've ever imagined, predictability takes a back seat and the movie throws at you, everything you've never expected.Needless to say Caesar is once again the core of the story and it doesn't disappoint, not even a bit. The movie was about 130 minutes but it kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting more. Its well paced and you will never feel one scene out of place or unnecessary. Instead of dialog-ridden human sequences, I preferred the ape sequences more, of course it was a total pandemonium what with the apes screaming and making a ruckus but when Caesar's on screen there no possible way to get my eyes off it. Like many even I wanted Andy Serkis to win an Academy Award for Best Actor for playing Caesar in Rise of Planet of the Apes, such was power and perfection that he had brought underneath the layers of CG and you can see more of that here. If I had to give you one single reason to watch this movie other than Caesar, it would be his trusted right hand, Koba. Koba is insanely intimidating and could be considered one of the best anti protagonist in recent times. The humans, played by Jason Clarke, Keri Russel and Gary Oldman did their parts well. Jason Clarke did bring about a sense of empathy backed up by Keri Russell while Gary Oldman's character was a prisoner of his own tragedies from the past.The visuals have been beefed up to an extend where you'd think twice seeing an Ape, if its indeed CG or real. Its a huge leap from the first movie and there were scenes where I was truly dumbfounded. I know 5 years from now, there might be something more advanced and visually arresting than this, but when I was watching this at the big screen, all i could do was gape at WETA's visual wizardry that went into the movie. Michael Giacchino's score became that icing on that immensely appealing cake.Having directed movies like Cloverfield and Let Me In, Matt Reeves skillful direction comes into play and makes Dawn of The Planet of The Apes a great watch. Had i to concise and compare Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, it would be with The Dark Knight, Rise of Planet of the Apes being Batman Begins of course. I know I went overboard here comparing it with the Dark Knight, but still it deserves to be compared with no less. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is undoubtedly one of the best movies in recent times, I even felt it's a notch above X-Men Days of Future Past. I can assure you this'll be one of those movies that'll keep you glued to your seats. On a surface it looks like any good summer action blockbuster, but there's more to it that meets the eye just like the undertones of Rise of Planet Of The Apes. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is not monkey business, well sorta, but its still a must watch and SHOULDN'T NOT BE MISSED.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
255,brent_or,Astoundingly Powerful,9,12 July 2014,"As of this moment, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is easily the best film that I have seen in 2014 so far, and more than that, it is the best large-scale science fiction/drama/action film that I have seen in years. I would have to go back to something like The Dark Knight or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to pull up another film that floored and impressed and entranced me the way that this one did.This is basically the best possible, most compelling thing that could have been done with this franchise. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) was a terrific, thoughtful new spin the concept. Dawn is the further evolution of the concept, and it is breathtakingly powerful. This in an intense film, and it changes gears from beautiful to frightening, hopeful to tragic, several times to great effect. The philosophical questions (raised by this theoretical premise) are very heavy. This may be fiction, but a scenario of similar effect is not beyond realistic imagination. This film makes you think.I will not get into individual details, other than to say that they are pretty much uniformly excellent. The only thing that I really found disappointing was one of the human characters, whose reckless behavior feels more like a plot device than a realistic characterization. Still, that is just one very small part of what is an astoundingly well- executed whole. (And honestly, what would our world be without random idiocy to start wars and mess things up? It happens, sadly.)Bottom line, there have been several good films so far this year, in the broad category that this one fits into, more or less. I loved X-Men: Days of Future Past, and not to take anything away from it, but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best film of the year, so far, and I would not be surprised to still feel that way at years' end.This is an incredible experience. Note that the running time is fairly long, but it is hard to find fault with that. I was fixated on the screen from start to finish. Also, there is some intense imagery (although not of the gore/blood variety) and I would not recommend this film for young children. That being said, for basically everyone else, there is no recent film that I would recommend more highly than this one. Heart, intelligence, hope, fear, thrills, release. Incredible.Edit: I find it very interesting that seemingly almost all of the ""helpful/not helpful"" votes cast on reviews chronologically the same or more recent than this one...have come from people who apparently do not think that this film is good. Which is to say that most of the reviews are very positive, and most of them have been voted ""unhelpful."" I have never observed any pattern quite like this.So, just to say, again: I have only seen a handful of big budget films in the past decade that--in my opinion--deserve marks as high as this one. Of course, it only works if you are part of the target audience. This is an emotionally thoughtful film first and foremost. It has some incredible action and spectacle, but if you go looking for that, or if you expect a film with this many characters to somehow spend even more time on each one of them (I feel that the character development is more than adequate) as some complaints seem to suggest, then you may be disappointed.But, again, there is no film yet this year that I have been more impressed with.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
256,seige-hound,A fantastic film where apes overshadow humans,9,13 July 2014,"Dawn is a great film. It has good characters, great visual effects, a compelling plot, and some amazing cinematography.Go Watch it now. Enough said.Although it isn't perfect:My main (albeit minor) problem with Dawn is the human characters. Rise was great in that regard, since Caesar (I know it's spelled the other way, I like this spelling better) was the only ape until about half way through and the main focus of the film was the relationship between him and Franco's character. The advertising of Dawn lead on that Gary Oldman would have a much larger role as the primary antagonist, but he was a minor character at best (similar to the Bryan Cranston situation in Godzilla). The real antagonist is Koba, the scarred ape from the first movie. The advertising implied that Oldman started the war, but it was actually a coup by Koba. Even though the advertising was well put together, it is very misleading.The main humans are a father, stepmother and son, who go to the ape village to try and fix a nearby hydro-electric plant. While Koba is very species-ist against humans, Caesar is compassionate and allows them to work at the plant, which pisses off Koba, who then attempts to assassinate Caesar and start the coup. The problem is because the focus is primarily on the coup, there isn't enough characterization for the human characters, even the main ones.Technically speaking this film is amazing. It is one of the few obvious but well used bookends I've ever seen. Usually I don't notice bookends, but it was rather blatant in a good way. The shots are amazing, and I would like to reference two particular ones, being the 360 tank shot and the single take running and hiding shot. shots like that, especially ones in heavy-CGI films, are hard to do, so that's automatic points toward the director.It's good. Watch it, you won't regret it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
257,sujanfaster,Just about there,6,16 July 2014,"I don't know why, but critics seem to like this Ape saga pretty much. I didn't like the first one much. I thought it was too much hyped. The trailer of DOTPOTA looked promising and moreover it looked it has the capability to strike a right emotional chord this time. But alas, it doesn't live up to the effect that the trailer provides.This time story is set in future after the 'Similian Virus' has scattered human beings around the world and they are becoming extinct. Only few healthy humans are surviving. They come exploring a dam that can help them generate electricity to make contact with outside world and they face off with the apes. Its about the ape-human war dilemma from then onwards. I don't care to explain that here. The story takes a bit too much time to build up and the first 40 minutes are wasted there. Too much forest, too much green, too much ape language. Moreover, I find the script not so ape-specific. Its almost like you could replace all the apes with human characters and still would have made this film.The only saving grace of this movie is CGI. It has some real quality and the role of Caesar is once again exceptional. Andy Serkis makes you feel Caesar exists in the real world. Jason Clarke has a meaty role and doesn't disappoint. This movie will help him to get more important roles in future. I am still wondering why Gary Oldman chose his role. It certainly didn't require an actor of his caliber. Other roles are not so important except for Toby Kebbel's masterful motion capture as Koba.I wouldn't say this movie is a waste of money if you watch in the cinemas. Some may like it some may not. But this could have been better.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
258,stephenlovelette,"Only great, nothing more.",8,11 July 2014,"If anything, marvel at the xylophone in the score.Because Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is merely 'great enough.'This is a movie for those who like the first. It's conceivably enjoyable for the uninitiated, but I don't advise it.The film opens with credits akin to Edge of Tomorrow; a smattering of newscasters and politicians reporting on the spreading influence.The visual images are grafted onto an international map in which an infection travels like a web. The dreaded lines arc from to dot to dot, like the mice in The Rescuers hopping a seagull from New York to New Orleans. Coincidentally enough, much of Dawn is shot in the same Louisiana city.And I'm not sure if the rest of you know, but they're letting broads into the screen writing business now. This is the second movie I've seen lately with a female screenwriter (Amanda Silver). The other, Jane Goldman, is credited as a writer on X-Men: Days of Future Past.Look fellas, if we don't do something, pretty soon the Hollywood sign'll be painted pink!Anyway. The difficult thing about science fiction is the viewer's required to buy in. Whatever universe the filmmakers create, no matter how fantastic, the world must follow the rhythms of reality.If genetically evolved apes fight their way free of society's clutches, the battle will be considerably more horrific than what occurs in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.I don't delight in dismembered limbs, but the lack of realistic action creates an inescapable awareness. One can't help but realize the humans are ethereally cushioned from agony.I like the first movie, but I didn't love it like some people. The main problem is the rating. PG-13 movies are usually four-quadrant films: Enjoyable by men, women, the young and the old. Thereby maximizing profit.So although the Dawn is better than the Rise, I'm not all that excited about Planet of the Apes.It works because it's quality filmmaking. The camera-work is excellent. There are several long takes, including one on top of a tank. The lens does two complete turns for a double panorama shot on a set full of teeming apes.I'm not sure if they're extras or just CGI, because the effects are strong. Ironically enough, the only time I noticed a slip is when an ape is carrying a human, and the flailing legs are clearly animated.Plus, the writing's strongfor PG-13.The dichotomies drawn between apes and humanity are well-crafted. Each individual character (be it simian or homo sapiens) is well-rounded, independently recognizable and compellingly motivated.The stakes are high, the settings are elaborate and all the right themes are explored.The climax leads me to believe this isn't the last we'll see of the Planet of the Apes. Perhaps there's even a plan for quadrilogy.But who knows if we'll still be interested after number three?Be that as it may, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is great. That's all.Catch it in the theater if you've got an interest. You'll like it.Just don't wait for anything after the credits. Apart from a quote that says the production supported 15,000 jobs (which isn't the clearest statistic) there's just more ape noise.And you'll get plenty of that along the way.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
259,Ansango,Better than the first,8,27 November 2014,"What a movie.After watching it i was fully blown away.This is what an intelligent post-apocalyptic sci- fi should be.The plot was not very good but is was executed very nicely.But i must say that it was too predictable.Still i enjoyed it and felt emotionally attached with the story.Emotional scenes were poignant.If a little more attention had been paid on the script then it would have gained an instant classic status.In acting department everybody was OK.The characters of the movie hadn't been developed nicely.The plot also contained some loopholes but they can be forgived as the screenplay is very crisp and smooth.Special effects were mindblowing.It could be nominated in Oscars for best special effects.Music was just OK.Nowadays many movies are coming which relies heavily on CGI and has no or very little story.But this movie manages to separate himself from this league by its powerful storytelling,grand visuals and an interesting premise.Overall it was a great watch... RATING : 7.8 out of 10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
260,Tyson14,Exhilarating and moving; an epic sequel,10,29 July 2014,"Rupert Wyatt's 2011 reboot of the Planet of the Apes Franchise, 'Rise', is one of my favourite films of the last few years. A thrilling action film with an intelligent narrative and plenty of heart, it was an almost totally unexpected and very pleasant surprise. For 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', director Matt Reeves continues the story where Wyatt left off, and Reeves has satisfyingly made a sequel of such impressive quality that is at least the equal of its predecessor and in many aspects surpasses it.The story takes place a decade since Caesar led his fellow apes to begin a new life away from captivity in the forests beyond San Francisco. The group has expanded and thrived and constructed a sort of ape city among the trees. Here, Caesar has continued to command the loyalty of his fellow simians and remains chief, while he now also has a young family of his own to protect. Back in San Francisco, many years have now passed since a deadly virus born from the gaseous form of the drug ALZ-113 (referred to as 'Simian flu') has all but wiped out the human race, though a pocket of survivors exhibiting a genetic resistance remains in the city. The apes and humans have thus been segregated until a chance meeting with a small band of human explorers reunites them once more, bringing back some old memories for Caesar while igniting tensions between the two groups that threatens to boil over into all-out war and a battle for evolutionary superiority.The film plays on the natural mistrust that the apes have of the humans, and vice versa. While much of the fun of 'Rise' was in watching Caesar's ascension to power as a Spartacus-style leader of his fellow down-trodden apes, 'Dawn' focuses on Caesar's struggle to maintain a fragile peace between his own kind and the race he was brought up amongst. Chief antagonist is Koba, Caesar's general and one time laboratory bonobo whose innate hatred of the human race threatens to destroy all that Caesar has battled to build. In another motion-capture acting tour de force, the outstanding Andy Serkis is again the subject for Caesar's movements and expressions and gives an astonishingly powerful performance that is full of presence, depth and charisma. Caesar has all the makings of a classic film character.Human performances again mostly take a back seat to Caesar's ongoing struggles. Gary Oldman is great as always but is a little underused as the embattled leader of a human fraction living within a guarded tower amongst the ruins of San Francisco, but Jason Clarke has plenty to do as Malcolm, the lead of a small group of engineers that take up a role in diplomacy and begin to form a strong bond with Caesar.The exhilarating action scenes and set pieces are of a grander scale than in 'Rise' and with the use of some truly spectacular digital effects that are as realistic as any you will see, makes for an absorbing visual feast. But the finest achievements of the film lie in it's thoughtful, emotional core, that cleverly aligns our sympathies with both apes and humans and makes for a moving and thoroughly rewarding experience that is far removed from the one-dimensionality of today's brainless blockbusters. Never mind that 'Dawn' heads for a not entirely unpredictable conclusion, this is a quite beautiful film that has clearly been crafted with great care and intelligence. A fabulous achievement.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
261,OlieRendch,This movie is actually the definition of intense,10,24 July 2014,"I've been looking forward to this film for while, back when I watched Rise of the Planet of the Apes I thought that it was such a well made movie and looked forward to where it was going. Now I finally get to see what has become of Ceaser and his tribe, and boy did I. Dawn starts off showing us an average day in this society the apes have built up in the last 10 years; and that just to start off was fascinating, the shots you see, the feel of it all is just unlike anything you've ever seen. Soon after you start getting the plot, the humans need to get to a big damn to restore power but the forest of the apes blocks their way. Now through the various interactions between apes and humans you are holding your breath just hoping for both their sakes every single meeting between them goes well, you can feel the power of such a sight of these apes and how scary they must be; even within the ape tribe itself you see trust issues start with one of the apes - the incredibly freaky-looking Koba. You can also see from the humans apocalyptic camp how they're getting so desperate you know that the climax isn't going to be nice. Now with this story you may start predicting certain events but after jut a few more scenes you realise the plot is going a completely different way, there were most definitely a few surprises in there for me, so as whole, the storyline was fantastic. The actors themselves, well, who can fault Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture does an excellent job, I love how realistic this apes moved and look, just great; the humans although weren't bad actors I just wasn't as involved in their lives as I was the apes, I had been with Ceaser longer so these new people we had to like just were OK, not bad but nothing special. Of course I have to touch on the special effects, the CGI in this movie was out of this world, some of the things you see I probably couldn't distinguish between physical prosthetics. The feel and tone of this film is so unique you come out the cinema thinking 'wow'. The only critique I have is probably that there are one or two cliché events or lines of dialogue but in the end Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was Awesomeness.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
262,aldri-feb,A high tension Apes series with impeccable using of visual effects,8,11 July 2014,"While the summer blockbuster movie is nearly to be over, I think we probably won't find a winner inside ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" but at least what this movie offers is beyond expectation and satisfying to it's audiences. ""Dawn"" is much darker, more intelligent, more tension, more gun fighting, more improvement in visual effects, and in some aspects have better quality than ""Rise"". It's a perfect sequel to bridge the origin story into a larger issue in ""The Planet of the Apes"" series. Matt Reeves and the writer team had successfully shown life of two different species, their own problem to survive from end of the world circumstances also brought explanation of why they couldn't be together without any silly script or plot holes.But of course most achievements should be rewarded to the using of visual effects and it's department (considering almost every scene involved them) who had created realistic look of the apes itself especially for Caesar character. Caesar is undeniably flawless in this sequel and the outlook easily makes him an iconic leader to his colony. Though perhaps the movie felt too serious and struggles with monotone score, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a breathless franchise with brain and rich of heart and emotional depth.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
263,jackbanister16,Fantastic movie,9,17 July 2014,"Saw this one over the weekend and I walked away very impressed.I can't say this is as good as ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" but it's very, very close! Rise, had the dynamic touch of emotion, action, humor, and intensity to make it a brilliant prequel. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" is a more somber and serious movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.The movie starts a decade after the first one (prequel) with the apes in complete control. Caesar is the undisputed king of the apes and has started a family of his own. What little humans are left, attempt to cross into ape territory so that they can repair a dam and provide power for their community. As you can predict, this creates tension between the apes and humans, thus propelling the plot forward. That's all I'll say about the plot.The cinematography is outstanding. You can tell the director and DP worked hard to give the backdrop a very authentic feel. None of the backgrounds seem animated or green screened to me. Everything has a very gritty, real feel to it and that lends well to the story.Acting is amazing...by the apes... The motion capture REALLY shines in this movie. Animators did a tremendous job. I found myself thinking that the apes looked real after a while and had to remind myself that they were CGI. A movie definitely shouldn't be judged on its graphics, but on this occasion, it really is a spectacle. I haven't seen ""Transformers,"" yet, but I can almost guarantee that it's got nothing on this movie. Sorry, Mr. Bay.The plot is heavily ape focused and light on the human focus, but in my humble opinion that's how it should be...The whole story focuses around the de-humanization of the human race and the humanization of the simians.Although it's a somber movie, there are still plenty of laugh out loud moments throughout so be prepared to chuckle.Also I've seen people on this board criticizing the movie for lack of realism. It's a movie about TALKING APES for crying out loud...If you want a movie that's ""realistic"" go watch something else.This is a great summer blockbuster. Highly recommend checking it out! - JB",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
264,ryanskywalker-87402,One last chance for peace.,9,23 July 2017,"Right after Rise of the Planet of the Apes one already knew that the story would continue, and that's where Dawn of the Planet of the Apes has come by. And if Rise of the Planet of the Apes only had come by in the same manner that any superhero origin story would have played out by setting up the tone for films yet to come, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes already has found itself more room to create a more distinctive identity. But being as I've never particularly been the hugest fan of the original film franchise, it's nice to see that these new films are able to form an identity of their own for it takes me by surprise how much I enjoy them. These aren't just mindless, disposable blockbusters that only find themselves living within the moment, these films leave behind an impact that calls out for far more - among many reasons I'm glad these new Planet of the Apes movies are around.The ending of Rise of the Planet of the Apes already begged for more questions to be asked in regards to what was only going to be made of mankind's future as the apes have only found themselves growing in spontaneous numbers. The Simian flu has already decimated the human population whereas Caesar and the other enhanced apes are already making a community for themselves, attempting to live at peace away from the humans. Perhaps answers to questions being asked about whether or not the humans and apes will find themselves able to live within peace is only going to leave behind predictable answers, and yet it doesn't make the final product any less riveting for what it is - it also feels rewarding just watching how everything will build up. For as the first chapter had focused on how the apes had found themselves coming to be, this one only had found itself sitting within a broader canvas and thus the fact it calls for more possibilities only makes an exciting product.In contrast to Rupert Wyatt's efforts behind telling the story present in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves coming into the director's chair has only found itself beneficial. For as functional as Rupert Wyatt's efforts may have been in allowing a story to come and set itself in motion, Reeves, best known at the time for Cloverfield and Let Me In, creates a far more distinguishing approach that not only has resulted in a better film than its predecessor, but has also left behind one of the better blockbusters in recent memory. Many of the highlights that we remember perfectly from the predecessor, whether it be Andy Serkis's performance as Caesar or the visual effects (although they are evidently more advanced in here) come back to shine, yet not without the clear calling for more because of the canvas that Reeves has created on the screen.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes finds itself spending far more time with its human characters while allowing the story of the apes to breathe in a life of their own. Because of this, it is easier to get a grasp on its own characters' motivations whether it range from Caesar's attempts to come at peace with the humans or Dreyfus's intention to wipe out their race to preserve humanity. In addition to having far more compelling human characters a cast that ranges from Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, and Jason Clarke, far more compelling antagonist motivations are present that ultimately allow for a greater character study all the way through because Reeves doesn't blindly paint these characters as villains for the sake of moving forward. In Gary Oldman's Dreyfus we still feel a great resentment towards his own actions because of what measures he would take to preserve his own kind, and at the same time within Koba we have actions that make sense from perspective. They aren't ""bad"" by nature, but that's why they've ever managed to leave behind a great impact with their own roles.Yet despite having so much more working efforts than Rise of the Planet of the Apes, somehow it also comes out as more expository. I appreciate how these films don't blindly go about with painting the human race within a single-sided light, but with the obvious political allegory having already been established - one aspect in which I find myself getting more critical of Dawn comes by, it has already painted within a broader and darker canvas because it has found itself free to roam after an origin story had already been set up, but it only comes to repeat a message already having been told, thus in part it finds itself losing a sense of its own identity. Sure, there's far more that I appreciate in the narrative that Matt Reeves has created as opposed to what Rupert Wyatt had presented only as a means of getting something done and over with, but a greater feeling of separation even from its own predecessors would also be much appreciated out of these films.Functioning as a sequel, what Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is servicing comes more than just as one film continuing what its predecessor has already established wonderfully. Even if it may seem more expository, there's still no denying that its freedom has also created what can easily be seen as a more confident and engaging affair altogether. These go beyond exciting action sequences and outstanding visual effects work, because Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also works beautifully in how it approaches its own characters with how they have come to be. In an age where one can dismiss blockbusters as being tiresome and repetitive, what Matt Reeves has presented with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is more than just exciting storytelling, it is fantastic blockbuster filmmaking all around.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
265,prospectus_capricornium,The Best 'Apes'movie to date. A Brilliant and Intelligent Sci-Fiction Film.,9,10 July 2014,"If you think 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is good, see this movie. Three, years after Rupert Wyatt brought the 'Ape' franchise back to life, Matt Reeves continues the saga with a stunningly inventive and thrilling sequel.'Dawn' follows a middle-aged Caesar (Andy Serkis) as he leads over his group of genetically-evolved apes and while also assuming responsibilities as a father to his son, ten years after human civilization is crushed by an annihilating virus.Probably the best budgeted movie I've seen this summer, 'Dawn' is simply epic in every sense. It has a brilliant script to match its equally epic visuals, topped by its magnificent use of the motion capture technology. Through it, Andy Serkis' Caesar, singularly shines as the most significant element of this movie. It'stunning to witness the apes' emotions being captured like they are actually humans, and it's even amazing to realize than even without the presence of actual humans, the story can still work and be intriguing and compelling enough on its own. Along Cesar, he is accompanied by equally effective ape characters including Koba (Toby Kebbell), an revengeful warrior whose hunger to retaliate against humans is heightened by Caesar's seemingly revitalized bond with them, and Cornelia (Judy Greer), Caesar's wife. They are joined by human characters led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), who works to create a strong bond with the ape and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), the resistant human leader.It's really refreshing to see a film such big budgeted as this one be sensibly and intelligently written and executed while still making its spectacular visual matter. Action scenes are in right spots and are placed in explosive sequences towards the end. The original score is also brilliant and perfectly fitting. Arguably one of the best, if not the best, movie I've seen this year, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is a heart wrenching spectacle, a highly intelligent sci-fiction movie weaving an emotional tale of courage and faith.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
266,heatsink98,"Not bad, but not super.",7,11 July 2014,"Short Version: Ten years have passed since the simian plague wiped out a large chunk of Homo Sapiens. Survivors in the ruins of San Francisco want electricity and send the main character and an entourage to restart a hydroelectric dam where Caesar has built his ape village. A turf war ensues, apes abscond with machine guns, an ape coupe happens, and there's a big fight between humans and apes in San Francisco.This film has some nice effects happening with the apes. The plot is pretty basic and the acting is nothing super-duper. The driving force for the dam expedition is a little weak: just that the San Francisco residents are low on fuel and need electricity. But what happens if there's no electricity? They'll light candles and be grumpy? That bit of plot could have used a stronger motivator with more serious consequences.Gary Oldman pops in and out, and I wish he had more screen time. The tropes are easy to see coming, so there are not many surprises in the scenes. Dialog is mostly okay, but sometimes bland.The ape assault with machine guns is pretty crazy. The apes also seem right at home firing automatic weapons, but I never saw one of them reload and I'm pretty sure they didn't have extra clips. I suppose we'll chalk up the number of bullets fired to movie magic.Verdict: A little better than average, but the story line is not incredibly strong. The fight scenes are pretty good once the conflict gets rolling. Overall, the film is worth seeing.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

269,jkbonner1,Apes versus humans-who will prevail?,8,9 September 2014,"The movie takes place ten years in the future. Humanity has suffered a severe pandemic of a virulent unspecified disease and only pockets of humans have survived. One such pocket is in the San Francisco area. Supplies and provisions are running scarce and the humans desperately need a viable energy source. Nearby is a hydroelectric dam that had provided energy, but it's been on the fritz since the scourge struck. The leader of the humans, Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), has sent out a team headed by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) to go to the dam and see what it'll take to get it up and running again. We see the team earnestly trekking through thick underbrush and a forest of trees to reach the dam. But this forest is inhabited by other creatures too. Chief among these are the apes. And they don't like humans invading what they deem is their home ground.Many of the apes suffered at the hands of humans. Some in zoos; some the subjects of medical experimentation. The rest have picked up on the fear that humans engender. The leader of the apes is a chimpanzee named Caesar (Andy Serkis). Although we later learn that he was treated kindly by a human who was endeavoring to teach him language, he, like the rest of the apes, dislikes humans. He confronts the human party and tells them in no uncertain terms to stay out of ape territory and to go back where they came from.Dreyfus is upset by this news, for he knows they must find a viable energy source very soon or the human camp will collapse in chaos. They desperately need power to establish communication with other human groups who have managed to survive. He charges Malcolm to take his group back into the forest and effect a peace between humans and apes so they can reach the dam. Malcolm reaches an accord with Caesar and the team reaches the dam. The human team manages to get the dam running again, supplying San Francisco with needed hydroelectric power.However, reaching an accord with humans has stirred up trouble among the apes, and several of them protest. Among these is Koba (Toby Kebbell), a chimpanzee who bears the visible scars of incarceration and medical experimentation. When Caesar tries to quell their objections telling them the humans are trustworthy, Kobe screams at him, ""All humans lie."" Meanwhile, back in the human stronghold in San Francisco Dreyfus believes it will be inevitable that the humans will have to fight the apes for hegemony. He opens the armories and humans begin training with firearms and weapons for the inevitable confrontation. Koba, always suspicious of humans, enters the human compound and playing the dumb ape before two humans, grabs one of their automatic rifles and shoots both of them. He then takes the rifle back to the ape camp. At first he intends to show Caesar the threat they're facing, but when Caesar seems too cuddly towards the humans, Koba shoots him, severely wounding him.A few of Caesar's followers remain loyal to him, but Koba stirs the apes up to attack the human stronghold. Malcolm is aghast. Warfare breaks out. Malcolm helps nurse Caesar back and Caesar realizes through Malcolm and his previous trainer that some humans are good. But Koba and his ape followers breach the human stronghold and it's war with no mercy. Dreyfus kills himself to bring down a whole tower in an attempt to disrupt the ape attack, and Caesar and Koba duke it out to the death with Caesar eventually winning the contest. At the end Caesar realizes that peace between the two species is doomed to failure because although some humans are good, like Malcolm, many more are like Dreyfus. The movie ends ominously with another war brewing.The costuming and special effects in this movie are first-rate. The apes are very convincing. It's good sci-fi, but it's not a true prequel to the original even though the title suggests otherwise. I saw the original Planet of the Apes when it came out back in 1968. In that movie three astronauts set out on a rescue mission to a distant planet. Their ship crash-lands, with one survivor, George Taylor (Charlton Heston). Taylor believes throughout almost the entire movie he is on that far-away planet, which mysteriously has a civilization consisting of speaking apes and savage humans devoid of language. No one who's seen the movie will ever forget one of its most salient lines when Taylor roars at a gorilla who's manhandling him, ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape."" No one who's seen the movie will ever forget either the ending, when Taylor discovers the shocking truth that he was on Earth all along, albeit an Earth in the distant future.A slight quibble. Although in the original, the apes presumably achieved high intelligence through genetic mutation from exposure to radioactive fallout from the warfare set off by humans, in this movie it's unclear how the apes became as intelligent as they did.8/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
270,botrytis,Something fresh for a new generation,9,25 July 2014,"Dawn of the planet of the apesIt's fine thing to see that Hollywood has some good momentum to show the good side of itself, and this franchise is the one that it should be proud of since it's timeless themes about human nature, morals and racism never seem to get boring or over-debated, also these are remarkably presented here (in this franchise)And that's why from this moment I would consider myself as a fan of the Planet of the Apes, as I adored the original 1968 piece, and now these two really enjoyable ones that came in 2011 and 2014, we shall say that this franchise has the power through these ages to maintain it's freshness and intelligence. The Rise/Dawn of the Planet of the Apes both show how this theme should be look like for this new generation, and man, they do it so well! But before I get into reviewing the sequel, I had an opportunity to see the Conquest of the P.o.t.A."" a day ago and even though it lacked visual and solid narration, the ending Caesar speech left me speechless, and practically the apocalyptic scene showed the Birth of the P.o.t.A"". What kept me stunned is the character of Caesar, his appearance in this ending was frightening, balancing the moral questions between positive and negative terms in a way, that the audience couldn't tell if it's a good or a bad thing that these apes took control over humanity. These modern pieces (2011, 2014) depict this character, Caesar in more dimensional way though, these motion pictures in their run-time both manage to make complex emotional connections between the audience and some characters with different views in the film, making the movie fresh and alive, and make us believing the situations throughout the happenings. So the sequel: Story: After a solid kick-starter origin story we get into an amidst- apocalyptic world where both party has it's own way to assimilate into this new environment: the apes kinda start a new life creating their recently born civilization, and there are the humans, who actually have to get use to the huge back-step system of theirs and actually continue their living with the tools and technology that they can still use and which work. And you guessed well, they gonna have problems with each other, even within groups, but let's not talk about the specifics. The emotion centered story really has many to give even though seemingly it isn't complicated, but that's why it is necessary to inform that it's center is the emotion relations which give huge weight to the conflicts between humans and apes. CGI: Even when I was watching the 2011 ape movie, I was mesmerized about the technological implementation they could achieve in that, how the apes became so realistic that it actually was believable on the screen even though we still see it's CG, but that's what is great about these two movies  I don't mind about these computer generated images, because they are done with great attention and ambition, and they emerge really well with the real environment. I usually stay away from these effects used in movies, but these deserve attention, which for they don't even cry for, well for me at least, mine is always taken as I see them here.Music: I was so pumped up as I heard the classic elements given in this soundtrack here which were representing the classic movies in some places, it really gave the hint of these happenings having overshadowing factor, as the whole franchise actually emerge into one in these moments. Overall it is a good soundtrack with huge Hollywoodish monumental sound, but only these classic"" moments were highlighting. (These tracks I spoke of are titled on OST as : Close Encounters ... and ""Monkey to the city"")Actors: Quite solid from the human"" side, however of course playing an ape it's more interesting part, and were pretty well done. Check out some behind the scenes videos, they are very interesting The guy who played Smeagol actually is a solid actor (Andy Serkis), I'm starting to realize that. Important things to mention: -The conflict between these groups is well crafted, no matter how you want to make nitpicking comments on these products, the quality of filmmaking shine on the screen as you watch these, and relatively, compared to todays Hollywood norma, the Planet of the Apes (as a franchise) is remarkable creation, even if you watch the classic, or the prequels.The action packed adventure relies on characterization, to create different values which are built up on different world views, and with that the storytelling and sympathy becomes complex and multi-directed, but mainly balanced. The prequels mix some main story elements from the classics forming a new one, additionally showing the whole picture in new, fresh form, which maintains the intelligent message of the whole franchise, but also adds new dimension that wasn't seen before on this field : fantastic visual, entertaining surface. Overall: It's a must see motion picture, with it's huge multi-ambitions it deserves great gratitude and respect from the audience, as the Hollywoodish mainstream plagues the media and still some of the products can keep their head up to say: Yeah, we can show something new and clever here ... we got some QUALITY"" ... so that's what I call simply this product: A Quality One!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
271,jhigginbotham151,Smart and character focused is key here.,9,24 July 2014,"'Dawn' takes place ten years after the virus that was teased in the previous film became a worldwide crisis, and killed hundreds of thousands of people. The apes live peacefully in the woods and have evolved to using sign language and basic speech to communicate and have managed to build a community for themselves. The humans meanwhile are starving for electrical power, and its the damn on the apes homeland that can give them the power they need.The film is really an Ape centric movie. It focuses on how the apes have come to the point where they are more like humans than they know, that they are capable of things they thought they would never do. It's a journey for Caesar and the next step in the evolution of apes until we finally see something similar to the original '68' film.Caesar is played to award winning caliber by Andy Serkis. Many don't think that motion capture is a viable form of acting because 'it's the computer that does the acting', well I'm here to say that Serkis performance shines right through the CGI, but not to an extent that we see Serkis in spandex acting like an ape. The combination of flawless effects with high quality acting gives us this character that we never think twice if he's real or not.That goes with all of the other apes as well. Toby Kebbells Koba is almost on the same level as Serkis Caesar, the anger that Kebbell portrays gives you the sense of a tortured soul that just wants revenge on the people who tortured him. I think a very understated performance is Nick Thurstons Blue Eyes. The emotion that we get out of this character is huge, but not over the top. The scene between Caesar and Blue Eyes is heartfelt and made all the better because, once again, we never question the reality.The humans are criticized for not being fully developed, and while I agree to an extent, the humans really aren't the focus. Jason Clarke is a man who simply wants the best for his son, paralleling Caesar, and he isn't the typical leading man, just like Franco in 'Rise', he's someone who just wants everything to be normal and peaceful, he doesn't want war. Keri Russel and Kodi Smit-Mcphee are probably the least developed among the human cast but its isn't a loss, it doesn't take away from the film at all because the characters do whats needed and thats just fine.Gary Oldman gives a good performance as Dreyfus in a limited role (sadly it seems thats his thing nowadays, limited roles). A scene where he looks over pictures of his family is tear jerking and all the character development we really get from him but thats all we need to realize that he isn't a villain, he's a man who blames the apes for the death of his family and wants revenge. That's an interesting thought as well, there isn't really a villain in 'Dawn'. Dreyfus has a reason for his actions as does Koba to an extent so really the story is about survival and not good vs evil.Overall, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a smart, character focused film that shows the summer blockbusters can be clever and emotional without being heavily action focused as well.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

They reach a fragile peace, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war that will determine who will emerge as Earth's dominant species.""If you liked the first part I am pretty sure you will love this one and were in the first part the CGI sometime left something to be desired in ""Dawn..."" the motion capture technology is used to perfection creating the perfect simulation of an animal avatar, that exudes realistic life condition. In this type of roles the body language is extremely important in actors performance for achieving the necessary realism and believability. But specially in close up is were this film truly excels. The little nuances of the facial expressions, as well as and specially the eye accessing cues which are truly impressive and expressive in it's intelligence and acting believability. Also the fur movement and the lighting of apes faces make them look detailed and simply, real!Director Matt Reeves sets up the whole story based on the premises of trying to make sure that we as the audience can feel empathy with the human survivors but specially with the apes. Without giving too much away the key to the whole story is what happens when two parts, human and Apes, agree on peace and prosperity, but ambitious dark characters around them have other plans...""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" was made without big stars...not counting Gary Oldman that is...who is soulful but underused. Andy Serkis might get an Oscar nomination for his CGI motion capture performance as Cezar. He captures the essence of an ape that in some way admires the humans and wants to be like them, but is also trying to not loose his connection to the animal kingdom. This is why he speak with apes using sign language not using human speech as much. He as a character is the lead of the film which is very unusual and because successful in its believability hugely satisfying. Toby Kebbell as Koba almost steals the film as a sort of Brutus archetype who becomes too ambitious for what he thinks is the good of his species! The human counter part of Cezar, Jason Clarke as Malcolm exudes passion and somehow delivers subtle performance that might not get the praise it deserves. This is his first movie were he takes upon himself the pressure as human lead in the story in the past being more of a solid supporting actor.As good as this film is I think the next part in this franchise will be an awesome storytelling and extravagant visual endeavor! All I say is that the WAR is coming! Like I said ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is more then just well used CGI, here it is used as a storytelling tool to deepen the family aspect of the characters. Making us care for the CGI creations (Apes) and their fate. There is also a bow towards Stanley Kubrick and 2001:Space Odyssey at the beginning of the movie during the deer hunting sequence. The director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) is using the same music as Kubrick 'Monolith' sound and obviously is paying the tribute to 2001 showing Stanley, how the correct ape CGI is done. (2001:Space Odyssey from 1968 is a masterpiece, but the actors in monkey costumes in the opening scene of the movie in front of the Monolith can be quite comical and dated, if you know what I mean) and that comes from someone who worships Kubrick. If only Stanley would have the technology of today back then... ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a great movie which not necessarily need to be seen in 3D.

While initially there is an attempt to co-exist, inevitably this situation leads to a battle for power that will ultimately decide the fate of both species.I thought this story was really well done and I was surprised at how moved I was by it. This was a great theatre experience and definitely surpassed it's predecessor Rise of The Planet of the Apes in terms of story telling. Time was taken to show how much progress the Apes had made and how they had formed their own society with education, laws and responsibilities; friendships and families; a peaceful, functional society. The world of the Apes was actually quite engrossing and this was crucial, because it allowed the events that followed to really resonate. The first half of the movie was spent developing the world of the Apes, I found this quite engaging and it really enhanced the film.There were quite a few tense moments to keep you interested as there was always a sense of danger and suspense as things unfolded; this was a very enjoyable and entertaining experience for the over 2 hour running time. There are even a few light moments, such as when Koba (voiced by Toby Kebbal from Rock n Rolla, Wrath of the Titans) has an unexpected encounter with some humans. There's also a notably strong scene that is hinted at in the trailer is when Cesar returns to his old San Francisco home and finds an old video of Will (James Franco) teaching him. I thought this was a very subtle, but really powerful scene.The cast of the film is outstanding. Andy Serkis (Gollum of The Lord of the Rings trilogy), Toby Kebbal (a mostly unknown actor to me) and the rest of the motion capture team have delivered some incredible work here! They breathed life into the Apes and are the very essence of this film; the movie industry needs to find a way to recognize this kind of motion capture work (outside of special effects), because without it these kinds of films simply don't work. Serkis's Cesar owns the screen; whether it's as a powerful ruler, a caring father or a somber ape missing his mentor and friend, Cesar is unquestionably an incredible cinematic creation and one that will not soon be forgotten. Kebbal's Koba is also a fascinating character that you love to hate. He runs the gamut from funny and loyal to conniving and treacherous. Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight, Leon the Professional) as expected delivers a minor but spirited performance as Dreyfus, who's burdened with doing whatever it takes to ensure his people's survival, but is desperately trying to regain the humanity they've lost to the virus. Keri Russell (Felicity and The Americans) isn't given much of a role, but quietly shines as Ellie in a few tender scenes. Jason Clarke however, produces a fantastic performance as Malcolm and throughout the film (along with Cesar) provides its emotional centre. As the film culminates, he and Cesar share a stunningly power scene that left me unexpectedly fighting back tears as it was incredibly moving (that really surprised me).But what makes this movie great are the special effects, they are incredible! Make no mistake, the stars of this film are Cesar, Koba and the Apes. I was amazed how emotions were conveyed in a very genuine, almost human way; so much so that you can't help but be invested in their story. Love, rage, jealousy, sadness, humiliation, fear, dominance, forgiveness; they are all on full display here to amazing effect. You almost forget you're watching special effects driven characters and get lost in them. Again, the special effects guys did a fantastic job here, I can't say that enough. I didn't think the 3D really added that much depth to the movie movie personally, so the film I'm sure will be just as enjoyable if you watch a non 3D screening. There also plenty of meaningful and believable action in this film as well, so if that's your main draw you won't be disappointed either.I felt there was an interesting theme throughout the film of the fragility of peace and the great lengths that one must go to in order to preserve it. Cesar believed that ""ape not harm ape"", but as the film progressed, he eventually realizes that this is not always possible. Despite one having the best of intentions, sometimes violence and the exertion of authority is the only means to maintain peace. An ironic, yet very sobering in it's accurate portrayal of society. I appreciated that the film didn't bash me over the head with it and kept it fairly subtle. This is a fantastic film from start to finish and a wonderful technical achievement; I'm definitely looking forward to the conclusion of this trilogy! This easily unseats X-Men: Days of Future Past as the best film of the year to date. If you're going to see one movie at the theatres this summer: this is it.Was my review not horrible? Great!

274,ubtgkse,Beautiful and exciting,9,13 July 2020,"Dawn of the planet of the apes has phenomenal visuals that fool the eyes, Andy Serkis giving his heavenly mocap, fantastic action with apes vs tanks, the ape culture is fascinating, great villains with koba and Gary oldman who you understand why there evil, the script is smart and well written, and a ending that makes you ask questions. The only flaw is the main humans while well acted are very bland and not interesting. Highly recommend, you'll have fun and think important questions.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
275,gianlucamarzano16,apes on horses!!,10,27 July 2014,"Most sequels these days turn out to be bad.But this summer it turns out almost all the sequels turned out great and dawn of the planet of the apes was the best.This movie takes place 10 years after the events of rise of the planet of the apes.the story is apes vs humans but as the story goes,conflict begins and layers begin to add up.The acting was great by everyone.The ones that stand out are Any Serkis and Toby Kebbell. Overall it has a great story,great action,great everything.This movie did setup for many more apes movies and I can't wait to see where they bring this story.I do think you would want to see the first one before thinking to see this.This is what a summer blockbuster is.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
276,blufrog49,"Monkeys, yes--plot , no",6,12 July 2014,"I am old enough to remember the first ""Planet of the Apes"" and how awesome it was for its time--in the ape re-creation as well as the innovative story-line, and probably the BEST ending scene from any movie, EVER. Fast forward to movies today, and this film does not disappoint as far as CGI goes and really making you feel as if the apes are real--all of them.Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, it was also fun to see the city, Mt. Tam, etc., recreated--but there are no ""subways""--it's BART!!--however, the plot is thin, hence my lower score.And I'm always looking for stereotypes--the 2 black main characters are techies. No Hispanics, NO ASIANS--from the Bay Area--are you kidding me? The lone woman is a nurse (or maybe a doctor)--but for God's sake (SPOILER!), why didn't she wash the blood off her hands after surgery? So see it for the special effects, but don't expect much of a story and you'll be OK.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
277,thomas-w15,"Best summer film, far exceeds it predecessor",9,20 November 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 9/10- I did not really have high hopes of the original movie Rise of the Planet of the Apes, but I gave it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised. It had stunning CGI effects and decent plot but I feel like it still had room to grow. Now, three years later the sequel to the surprise hit has come out and I could not have higher hopes for the film(especially since this summer has been a little weak.) I am pleased to say that this sequel far surpassed my expectations. With stunning visual effects, well-crafted intense and emotional scenes, and a well-developed plot, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes far surpasses its predecessor and brings the best summer blockbuster in two years.As far as the bad stuff about this movie goes, there is not much to say. Yes, in order to make a successful sic-fi action movie, there is a certain plot pattern that you must follow but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is still original in every sense of the word. That pretty much sums up the bad stuff.Now on to everything else. I will start with the CGI(computer generated imagery) effects since that is the biggest achievement of the film. I have not seen this good of CGI since Avatar. The way that make it seem like those are real super-intelligent apes and gorillas standing there next to humans is incredible. I was particularly impressed with the confidence the effects department had to use close-up shots on the apes faces and show all of the detail. It was not just the apes that were a CGI challenge either, the effects department had to CGI horses, deer, and obviously a near-destroyed city. I hope that get the credit they deserve for this because they should be given an Oscar for the incredible work they have done. The plot is nothing that will win an Oscar but as far as summer films go, it is the best ever. Remember how much people loved Avatar because of the visual effects but wished it actually had a well thought out plot, this is what they wanted. This is the movie that should go down in history for the accomplishments it has made. I mean just when you think you knew what was about to happen, the movie takes a completely different turn and keeps you on your toes the entire time. Its really hard for a film, in my opinion, to be so flawless in all of these areas and still be a completely bad-ass movie too. Now we come to the acting. I feel like the Academy Awards should give awards for motion picture acting because Andy Serkis, who plays Caesar, is a tremendous actor. All of the effort he puts in to his roles is amazing and it was amazing all of the mannerism he was able to master for his role. Toby Kebbell, who plays Koba, I also feel went above and beyond with his performance. Jason Clarke did was he was asked to do for the movie and I am pleased at the direction that his career is going. Gary Oldman was really the one to talk about in this film after Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell of course. I kind of felt that he did not put in his best effort after Batman Begins, but I am pleased to see that he still has a lot of great acting left in him. There are so many reasons to go see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Ground Breaking CGI effects, incredible plot, top of the line acting both on screen and off, and a general bad- assary about the movie. I recommend that you see this film as your first choice walking into theaters.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

279,mrinalmmehta,My Review!,7,29 August 2019,"That's a good sequel. They might have done a little too much like makeup of the Apes, jewellery they wearing etc. in the movie, but overall, good story, good graphics. I loved it! Character Caesar, well made.Peace Out!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
280,hou-3,Risibility factor too high for me,5,31 July 2014,"I'm not really in the right demographic for Hollywood summer blockbusters but I have a lingering fondness for the franchise and heard the movie praised, so I thought, it's a rainy afternoon, let's see how things are going with the apes vs humans saga. The movie started well by setting up audience sympathy for Caesar's world but went steadily downhill once the interactions started. The ape sign language quickly became tedious and it was unconvincing - there was simply not enough content in the gestures to communicate the complex messages going to and forth. The narrative arc was, sadly, as banal and predictable as any Hollywood spectacular I have seen. As usual, there was a yawning gap between the sophistication of the cgi and the vacuously thin story line. I know, this is blockbuster territory, but that doesn't preclude the occasional diverting twist and turn. The attack and battle sequences were lamentable. There seemed to be more and more apes and humans around - where did they all come from - and it was obvious that given the weaponry involved the outcome would be a human victory, not an ape one. However, having secured their implausible victory, what do the apes do next ... they put the humans in cages. What would they do with them? Feed them bananas? From then on I more or less gave up on the movie as it had obviously hit the buffers. It looked like even the actors realised the show was over and were just going through the motions. The only slightly redeeming feature of the last act was the reference to King Kong - a climactic struggle at the top of a tall building etc. I rather liked that. Other reviewers have picked away at plot goofs, coincidences, tropes, etc. and they are indeed numerous. Sadly disappointing. Five for the likable music score plus Andy Serkis as Caesar.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
281,ToxicJug,An Epic Followup,8,28 June 2021,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does exactly what a sequel should do! It takes everything that made the first film so great and cranks it up to 11. In this film we get to see how the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes has affected the world as time has gone by. Much like its predecessor, the films is visually stunning with incredible motion capture performances and memorable cinematography. The human side of this story is a bit lack luster in comparison to Rise but thats a small issue as the rest of the film is jaw dropping in every other way. The action sequences are uncomfortable to anything I have ever seen and we are given incredible character development for both our protagonist Cesar as well as our antagonists Koba who's rivalry carries this film and sets up the next installment in this franchise perfectly!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
282,Mynameisroman,Good movie but no surprises,8,15 July 2018,"Normally you don't expect too much from sequels but here I was surprised how good this movie is. maybe not as good the the previous one but its definitely a different movie and thats a good thing. the story makes sense and the events of the movie are the result of bad decisions by individuals. 
However the story wasn't perfect and had some flaws in how a couple of humans behaved. But they needed to get the story going so i might forgive that. The CGI was great and believable too.
one thing that was a little over the top was the state of the city. a little too overgrown by nature in only 10 years. but its just a detail. overall a very good movie!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
283,ChristianLeFeuvre,A seriously impressive sequel,10,7 July 2017,"'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes' was released in cinemas in 2014, and is the sequel to the surprisingly impressive 2011 hit movie 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes'. Set 10 years later, and the world spreading disease that is hinted at in the end credits scene of 'Rise Of' has wiped out most of the human population, the apes have grown in both numbers and intelligence, and live on the outskirts of San Francisco as a community led by Caesar. With no interaction between humans and apes for so long all seems well, but the remaining humans in the city are struggling as the power source they need is dwindling and the only hope is to reroute power from a hydroelectric dam back to the city. Only the ape community now live so close to the dam and a power struggle ensues between the apes and man. The apes blame humans for the history of experiments and captivity they endured, and the humans blame the apes for the virus that wiped out most of mankind. There is also a power struggle going on amongst the apes themselves too, as Caesar still has some compassion for man and doesn't wish for any further confrontation between apes and man, but realises the relationship between species will always be strained. Yet one chimp, named Koba, has let his hatred of humans fester and grow and sees them strictly as the enemy, and although he respects Caesar as his leader, he begins to distrust Caesar's feelings for humans. This movie is outstanding. Director Matt Reeves certainly delivers. 'Dawn Of' looks amazing right from the opening scene, the action is plentiful, there are some incredibly powerful scenes with some genuinely emotional moments too, but it has to be said, it is the power struggle between the apes themselves that is the film's most fascinating element. The special effects are fantastic. The motion capture work with the apes is truly impressive. Andy Serkis is back as Caesar, and his performance in 'Rise Of' was incredible but in this, he just gets better and better. He really is the heart and soul of these movies. I can't understand how this man has not been given an Oscar for his performance capture work. Jason Clarke plays Malcolm, who forms a bond with Caesar. He is a good actor and his performance is very natural, at times it honestly looks like he isn't acting. Gary Oldman is also in this movie, and as in every film he has been in he is just superb. His role as Dreyfus, is almost the human equivalent of Caesar. He is the leader of the surviving humans and will do anything to protect his community, just like Caesar with the apes. As much as this movie is visually spectacular, the direction, the cinematography, the music, and the performances, there is such a fascinating, emotional core to this film where you get really involved and attached to the apes. 'Dawn of.' improves in every way from its predecessor. Everything about this movie is better than 'Rise Of', and as Matt Reeves has directed the upcoming 'War For The Planet Of The Apes', I am very excited for its release. This is a superb film. Make sure you add both 'Rise Of' and 'Dawn Of' to your DVD collection.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
284,tgrock,It Can't Overcome Its Predictability,7,20 December 2014,"Despite all the messages about war and humanity that make the film somewhat interesting, every single moment of the film's plot is an overused trope.Even before seeing the film, I pondered why a Planet of the Apes would happen if its leader, Caesar, was a friend to humanity. Obviously, the humans would be hot heads and some of the apes would be hot heads too. There would be an ape who didn't agree with Caesar and kill him because he wouldn't go to retaliate against the humans. Then the apes would go all out against the humans killing them.This is what pretty much happens during the film. Obviously, there are some differences, but as the movie goes along, you can predict the more specific details that happen next.Since the movie got so many great reviews, I was expecting a better film. However, even if it was predictable, it still makes lots of mistakes when it comes to being believable. An example is this ape riding on a horse in the middle of a gun fight with machine guns and never getting shot like all the other apes do riding on horses. Another example is apes falling down or taking big hits and not getting knocked out, injured, or concussed. The last one is that the amount of apes shown in the film is around 100-200. Yet, during this big battle, it goes up to about maybe 500- 700.This makes the film feel really sloppy, which drags it down from maybe an 8-8.5 to a 7/10, which is the same score I gave Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Even though that film was even sloppier, it did have a great emotional bond between James Franco's character and Caesar--something Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also lacks.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
285,razvan-rogoz,Good sequel,9,13 July 2014,"First of all, it is a good movie. Go watch it.Now, it's not that perfect. It lacks any real closure from my POV, it tends to get a bit predictable (but in a smart way, not filled with clichés) and sometimes you really have to suspend your disbelief.Some people will see in it a social commentary. I don't think there is any but it is a very good portrayal of two different societies. The savages and the domestic switch sides in this movie.So is this a movie about humans fighting against monkeys or monkeys fighting against human? Both. In some ways, it reminded me of Jarhead and the futility of war and fighting, how there is no real winner.Go watch it. It's maybe the best movie seen in the last months. I enjoyed the first a bit more but this was a fast paced action - drama.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
286,user-543-975655,One Of The Greatest Sequels Ever,10,4 August 2014,"Just as it says above, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is possibly, maybe even most likely, the best sequel I have ever seen. From start to finish, I was 100% interested. It is in the top five movies I have ever seen. Anyway, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the rare cases that a sequel is better than the original. Seriously! I loved this movie more than Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Don't get me wrong, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic movie, but somehow Dawn bettered it. Possibly because Matt Reeves is a better director than Rupert Wyatt (sorry Rupert - it's only my opinion, though). Even though Wyatt is a great director, he just isn't even with Matt Reeves. Reeves directed other great movies such as Cloverfield and Let Me In. His way of purveying all of the scenes was great, just like in his other films. OK, so, the general aspects of the movie. The story, first of all. The whole story was so great at following the first film that it was almost as if they were both the same movie, just in two parts. It is very rare to see a fun and interesting story in an Action/Sci-Fi movie these days, because all of the good plots are used up already. However, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an original story and stayed fun to watch until the end. The fact that the writers came up with a way to display the apes as a civilization, just fantastic. It made the apes easier to sympathize with. Next, the characters. As with the first movie, there were apes such as Caesar, Maurice, and Koba. The human characters were completely new, and they included the always awesome Gary Oldman as Dreyfus, the great Jason Clarke as Malcolm, and Keri Russell as Ellie. Since the last movie, the motion capture has increased dramatically in quality, which made the apes even more believable, surprisingly. Now, all of the characters were either fun or despicable. Just like in the first movie, the writers and actors worked together to create characters that you really cared about, or hated. In fact, they even did that with the apes, which is awesome. As with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, there were quite a few characters that you could just flat out hate, and that is another thing that should be in a good movie. Now, the acting. The acting in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is just as good as it is Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The acting is actually the only thing that didn't improve at all in Dawn. With stars such as Andy Serkis, Gary Oldman, and Jason Clarke, you would think the acting would improve, but it didn't. Everyone displayed their emotions and said their lines very well, still. Now the visual effects, of course. Rise of the Planet of the Apes had extremely good visual effects throughout the whole entire movie, and so did Dawn, but Dawn had better, because it was made three years after Rise, of course. The detail is so amazing! You can make out the hairs, the facial expressions, the muscles moving, even the difference in skin tone. Rise had great effects, but they were much, much, much better in Dawn. Lastly, the music. The music is catchy and fun to listen to while watching the movie. Michael Giacchino did a wonderful job making it intense and serious. I thought the music helped intensify the action sequences, which included some of the best battle scenes I have ever seen. The battles appear so realistic because the apes are so human that it is almost as if the battle was going on between different countries. The battles were also sad, because a lot of people die. The fights were so intense that I caught myself gripping the arm of my seat a couple times. That doesn't happen a lot for me, so that's saying something. SO, overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was an amazing movie, and I was not disappointed at all by it. It might be the best summer movie this year. See ya!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
287,oragex,Pathetic,4,23 July 2014,"OK so I'm not into monkeys and stuff, already. To be expected, the film it's about watching chimps all the way, and those chimpos don't talk human that much. Not to mention they are pretty expressionless. Just like the extras in the beginning of the film who seem like being for the first time in front of the camera.0-Now, that said, can someone explain me why was this movie made? To make me understand that a chimp has a choice between being mean or choosing not to be aggressive? Like the US army in Guantanamo decided not to apply torture to terrorists? Or was the movie about to entertain people about monkeys shooting guns? I must be out of trend, what's up with the monkeys nowadays ? This film felt just like a double big Mac. Seems to hide some interesting development, yet it lets you totally on your hunger, less a $10 bucks. The difference is that a big Mac hurts your stomach, while this chimpo movie did hurt my mind for over 2 hours.To resume, this flick is useless.

289,CrisMovieCorner,"Godfather II effect, far superior than it's prequel.",8,16 November 2014,"After 2001's horrible attempt at a revival in the franchise, they saved it in 2011 with Rupert Wyatt's ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes"" brining in WETA Digital in order to create a more realistic look than actors wearing suits. WETA also returned to make the apes in the Dawn even better than Rise.I personally was a little apprehensive I thought the 2011 revival was less than desirable, I found the apes to be a below the standard expected in the modern blockbuster. However this time around in Dawn, the apes were incredible, if you were to watch not knowing they were CG, you would believe easily that these were real apes. Which really helps buy into the story, you feel like these apes truly are apes that have started evolving to rival humans, given they have been evolving rapidly over the 10 years since the ape revolution.Some of the motion capture performances in Dawn were incredible, stand outs in that bracket well, obviously one had to be Andy Serkis, we all know he is the go to man for mocap and this film is no different for others. The other stand out was Toby Kebbell who is a newbie to the franchise playing the returning Koba (played by Christopher Gordon in Rise), Kebbell was phenomenal as Koba this time around, Koba is physically and mentally broken and Kebbell shows that in his performance it oozes intimidation and fear in equal measure, up there with some of the great performances by Serkis himself in my opinion.The complete contrast of Serkis' Ceaser an ape of compassion, love and understanding to Kebbel's Koba was an incredible watch on the big screen. Their performances really help you feel like you're watching apes, something Rise was lacking I found. The technical heights (even literally) that Dawn reaches are incredible, some of the CG in the film will rival the best you have seen.Not to say that wasn't a few parts of the film that were a let, one scene that comes to mind included two light machine guns, you have to see to believe the mediocrity of it. It is something you expect to see in a B movie or a spoof film, didn't really feel right in this blockbuster master-class. Plus the complete under usage of Gary Oldman, in my opinion by far the greatest actor in the film, I mean nobody even comes close to his ability to me, and to under use him was a travesty. Second time this year a huge blockbuster has underused their best actor, ""Godzilla"" did the same with Cranston.Overall, the film was a great watch, packed to the rafters with action and drama with a nice splicing of character development. Director Matt Reeves makes the most of all things at his disposal (Oldman excluded) and uses them beautifully making one of those rare occurrences in which a sequel is superior than is predecessor. Highly advise this film, making my excitement for the third more than I ever expected after the first, Matt Reeves has brought a new lease of life to the apes franchise which I'm hoping is a long lasting franchise. If you didn't like the first I will say Kebbell and Serkis' performances will blow you away in this film along with the CG and the story.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
290,eddie052010,One of 2014's most disappointing films.,6,6 August 2014,"Summer season is back once again, and because of it we usually get an onslaught of films to cash in by being mindless, but entertaining films. While many films in the summer season follow this format, there are some exceptions to this rule. Occasionally you will get a much more intelligent smart film that while being fun, also forces it's audiences to actually focus and think about the events on screen, rather than just simply absorbing explosions and mindless violence for two hours. One of these exceptions was Rise of the Planet of the Apes, an absolutely brilliant film that was not only a surprisingly solid prequel, but it was as good (if not better) than the original Planet of the Apes. It was an intelligent, fun and complex film full of great performances (especially that of Andy Serkis) and ideas. It was so good that it instantly became one of the best films of 2011. So naturally, I was excited for this follow up, especially when it got glowing reviews from critics and the public alike. Sadly, I'm not as enthusiastic. While there are great things in there, it is mostly a disappointment that it a step back for the franchise.The plot is that a while after the Simian Flu from Rise has wiped out most of humanity, the apes led by Ceaser believe that they are at peace. However, the remaining humans are trying to survive and are often clashing with the apes to do so. Add some loose cannon apes intent on wiping out these humans and the fact that the humans needs to use the ape's land in order to get energy creates a potential conflict between ape and man. While the plot does manage to continue Rise's story, it does feel a lot more simple this time around and therefore the overall scope of the film feels smaller because of it.This also extends to the rest of the writing as well. Whereas Rise had complex themes about humanity and love that while detailed were very subtle, the themes here are blatant and are in your face without any sort of subtly whatsoever. This is further cemented by the extreme one- dimensional characters in both groups, with a gun-happy prejudiced man in the human's corner and an evil ape called Kopa in the apes, intending on killing the humans and taking over the apes, feeling that Ceaser is too soft, even if he is a fascist ruler who kills or imprisons his own when they don't agree with him. This is blatantly obvious symbolism for how a totalitarian state is weak as they are usually ruled by evil dictators who have no sense of co-operation or reality. Sure this may invite comparisons to Animal Farm, another story that uses animals to represent a totalitarian state, but the whole story wasn't just based on symbolism, whereas here, a lot of the story is structured through this symbolism and seems to rely on it heavily because of it.Because of this, the other strong elements of the film suffer. The strong first half of the film has many emotional and interesting moments and like Rise develops many complex themes with the apes becoming more human and some of the human characters are becoming more animistic in order to survive, creating an interesting contrast between the two. However, this is dumped for the more abrupt action heavy second half, which scraps these themes in favour of obvious political commentary and one-dimensional characterization as unlike Rise which took the time to build up to it's action oriented climax, the action here comes abruptly, only being here it seems because it's a summer movie and feels utterly forced because of it. Sure it has good action, but takes any the intelligence of the film. It doesn't help that the characterization is pretty bland too. Sure Ceaser is still a brilliant and interesting character, whose scenes are often the best in the film, as he faces issues of war, betrayal and being a father, and Andy Serkis delivers another brilliant mo-cap performance, even if he doesn't have as much screen time as one would hope. However, the rest of the characters don't hold up as well. The aforementioned one-dimensional characters of both species are not interesting, Jason Clarke's Malcolm is a good if uninspired hero, his family are given barely anything to do and Gary Oldman's character is merely a plot device to get the story to where it needs to go, and is the biggest waste of a great actor in a film since Kate Winslet in Divergent, even if his character's actions are a lot dumber. It also doesn't help that the film feels smaller than it's predecessor, which is rather odd for a sequel to do. The world feels a lot smaller, the simple plot feels more like a plot for the 70's POTA TV series and there's not much in terms of grand spectacle. There's nothing that matches the ape riot of Rise or anything in director Matt Reeves' Cloverfield for example. It honestly feels more like build up to future films than anything, feeling more like a stop-gap rather than something on it's own. True, the film isn't completely awful, as there are some things that are good, even great, here. The CGI is great as usual, the performances are brilliant and there are moments here and there and as it's own film it's not too bad. But as part of the Apes franchise, it is about as average and as disappointing as Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and shares the same problems. There is interesting stuff, but it tosses aside that in favour of blander characters and a smaller scope than it's predecessor. It's not bad, but rather more disappointing. Hopefully future sequels can fix the film's problems, but as it stands, the franchise is dangerously close to losing it's way. Wait to rent it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
291,carlo_simone18,An improvement from the first film in the trilogy,7,27 December 2017,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a solidly good film but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes expands on everything established in that film to great effect.The film is set ten years after the events of Rise where the ALZ-113 virus has spread across the globe wiping out most of humanity. Caesar's community of apes has grown considerably, and they believe humans to have wiped each other out until two apes stumble across a human in the woods and the narrative starts to progress.What I really liked about the narrative was the dynamic of the separate communities of humans and apes, with both just wanting to do what is needed to survive. In that sense the distrust certain humans and apes had for each other was understandable, even for the villain Koba who's hatred for humans fuelled most of his actions. This was rather thought-provoking and I enjoyed how that was explored.The special effects are brilliant once again with how the apes are brought to life and appear like they are a real part of this world, and from that Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell give excellent performances as Caesar and Koba respectively. Their dynamic as contrasting characters was one of the best parts of the film, which was fulfilled in a very cathartic way with Caesar dropping Koba from a great height to his death after he had betrayed him.However, for the human characters the performances were rather bland, especially from Jason Clarke, and surprisingly Gary Oldman who is usually very assured. His character didn't have much to do in the narrative either which was a little disappointing.In the end though this was an emotionally complex second instalment to the Planet of the Apes prequel trilogy, and one that sets up the final film in an effective manner.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
292,pinkled5,"Terrible, Clunky Dialogue Spoils Human Characters & Film",4,28 July 2014,"The apes were intriguing. But every time a human opened their mouth it was death by exposition. The characters were constantly spouting facts that all of them already knew, their words designed solely for the benefit of the audience and it constantly made me groan and put my head in my hand. Without real, believable dialogue I could not get into the human characters or their plight. The movie didn't make me care about their need for electrical power or their emotional connections to one another. And without the ability to connect to the characters I could not be drawn into the story.The apes were actually quite well portrayed. They had a depth to them that the humans lacked. Unfortunately, it was not enough to save the film for me and I had to give this one a low score.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
293,varnium,Perfect,10,13 July 2014,"Indeed it's one of the best drama-action movie of the decade.Surely, it does not have a Transformer-type special effect. But having hundreds of apes running, jumping, hanging, and rolling every where is just a phenomenal special effect which no movie in this year could rival. The audience will be left to wonder the entire movie on whether they are actually using real apes and gorillas or they are all CGI. This is truly an amazing special effect.From the scripting to the storyline, it's just flawless. Every element of the movie is consistent. Every interaction among apes, among humans, and between humans an apes, are just so natural as if there were really a connection between apes and humans. Every natural phenomenon, social interaction, and cause-and-effect relationship between all parts of the movie is just perfect.To put in analogy, consider Transformer. It's always difficult to accept the fact that the super advance robotic sentient has a terrible targeting system. And their sophisticated ability to transform is just ruined by the producer when they can't even transform into a powerful weapon which can destroy their enemy. For instance, why would they use old-fashion bullets instead of electrically charged lasers or EMP burst which can cripple their enemy completely?In short it is a terrible movie in terms of consistency and integrity. But Planet of the Apes is entirely the opposite.The director did a pretty marvelous job in keeping the emotion and tension between the human colony and ape colony. And it's so amazing how multiple minor events can accumulate and lead to a catastrophic event for both sides. You don't get this in other movies.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

""Dawn"" finds Caesar (played by Andy Serkis) 10 years after ""Rise."" The genetically altered apes live in the forest outside of San Francisco and most of the human population has died because of the virus that was unleashed in ""Rise."" Caesar is now a husband and father and lives in a peaceful community with the apes. However, things turn when the humans come back.""Dawn"" is a well done sequel. It builds on the themes and motifs of the first one. For themes, we see the scars of animal cruelty (both physical and psychological) and the importance of family. For motifs, we see eyes and the out stretched hand for permission. Thanks to the modern visual effects, it feels like the eyes are the window into the souls of these apes. ""Dawn"" has great motion capture visual effects. Its a stunning and visual treat. The opening scene with the apes hunting is very exciting. The apes look and feel real. Serkis is great as Caesar. Although he is replaced by beautiful visual effects, he captures the movement and voice of Caesar so well and gives him have a heart. Caesar is just visual effects, but Serkis gets you to feel Caesar's love and pain. This film is about fathers and sons. It's about generations and the violence we continue to pass down somehow. Caesar symbolizes the best of humanity while Koba (played by Toby Kebbell) represents human cruelty. These ideas battle themselves out both verbally and physically. It can be tragic at times.There is a storyline with the humans played out by Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, and Gary Oldman and they all are fine even though they feel more like stock characters at times. I think the film is at its best when we are with the apes dominate the screen though. We saw Caesar, Koba, and Maurice in ""Rise"" and we get to watch them grow. We get new ape characters like Blue Eyes and Ash that we start to care for. I was more interested in the ape side of the story and sympathized with them more. Humans can be such jerks. Michael Seresin's cinematography captures the grand scale of the film. Michael Giacchino's score is really good for the most part, but there are times where I thought it may have been a little exaggerated or distracting. Giacchino's score does a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the small and important moments though. Reeves' ""Dawn"" is a good follow-up to ""Rise"" and does what a sequel should do, build on the first and explore new areas of the universe it set up. It's smart and has great visual effects. ""Dawn"" is emotionally engaging and exciting. It's a blockbuster done right and I'm curious to see where this series can go.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
296,koen_smit,A beautiful story with strong acting and fantastic cgi.,9,8 August 2014,"In the first part of the movie we experience the life that the apes that got away from the humans created themselves. At the head of this clan is Caesar, whose story had been told in the previous film Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He presents himself as a very strong and charismatic leader. He reigns from love, is a wise leader and has the respect from his clan. But he's also troubled by the past, his family, the survival of his clan and by the humans who fear the apes. Only his lieutenant Koba seems not to be able to get over the hatred he developed for the humans because of what they did to him when he was still a lab-rat. But didn't Caesar himself feed this rage by giving Koba the approval to kill the doctor that tested on him, at the end of the Rise-movie? 'Ape not kill ape' he teaches his clan, but there he also states 'everything else is okay'. The rest of the movie is a result of the choices Caesar made, so long ago, when the humans re-appear in the lives of the apes.Andy Serkis once again get's into the motion capture suit, after Gollum and King Kong, and delivers a fantastic multi-layered Caesar. Gary Oldman creates a strong 'human who does anything to survive'. And when you get to see a bit more of his past, you understand him. He reigns from fear for the future and pain of what he lost and in his eyes the apes are the embodiment of that. Jason Clarke is the opposite; he wants to work together with Caesar and understands that these apes should be treated as equals, not as beasts.Although this movie is over 2 hours long, there is not a second I was not on the edge of my seat. O my, what a trip is this movie. From the very beginning, when you learn the way of the apes, you feel that this will change very soon. The expose of this movie is quite long but very well done; slowly, layer by layer it builds towards the re-appearing of the humans. It's a very clever and well-written script and the director didn't let himself be tempted to sensationalism. The result is a beautiful story with strong acting and fantastic cgi. Not for one moment I thought of the apes not being real. I simply loved it and am looking very much forward to the next part of Caesar's story.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
297,jan_kalina,"""Caesar love humans more than apes!""",10,26 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not your typical summer blockbuster. Not at all. Instead you get a heavy intense drama. A unfolding family saga where Caesar serves as Don Corleone. The visual effects are jaw-dropping, you won't think for a second that what you see on the screen might be CGI effects. That's the level of the technology nowadays.Caesar has grown older and wiser, built a community in the woods and is under the assumption that all the humankind is now extinct. Trouble ensues when the not-so-dead humans appear in the woods.Andy Serkis is just as excellent with the minimalist performance he has to give just as he was in the Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Only problem of the movie is Jason Clarke as Malcolm. Not his character but the actor is highly uninteresting and uncharismatic. Gary Oldman is in my opinion one of the most under-appreciated actors of our time. With so much little that he is given he still creates a mesmerizing character. The true standout character of this film is Koba. I don't what input is from the actor Toby Kebbell or what is the work of the animators but Caesar's second-in-command is an truly terrifying ape. Koba still holds a grudge against the humans and their deeds on him. Through him the director Matt Reeves shows all the horror of the war and what ""animals"" are capable of. Some things shown in the film would get a higher rating but only because it is apes doing these things to each other the creators get away with a PG-13 rating.I've heard that the script has underwent through many changes but I guess this is the best possible one. The first act serves as a reestablishment of the characters and the situation, they are in, the second act just simply put kicks ass and the third act kicks ass as well.I'm glad that these young talents get a chance to show what they have got in themselves so now we have more promising directors to look forward to along with Gareth Edwards. Matt Reeves sure knows how to strike fear into the hearts of the audience because he seems to be one of the few directors who can scare, just as he did with the magnificent Cloverfield. You have no idea how excited for the next Planet of the Apes and I'm sure you will be as well.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
298,anthonymora2,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Review,8,22 September 2014,"There's The Godfather Part II.There's Empire Strikes Back.There's The Dark Knight.And NOW APES ON HORSES!Dawn picks up ""10 winters"" after the events of 2011's Rise.Cesar,and his colony of advanced apes have found their paradise and have built a strong community complete with a school,doctors and a hunting squad.Caeser himself has a family.His wife just gave birth and his eldest son is learning the ways of becoming a man..ape..Man-Ape.One day these pesky humans come and disturb the peace as we humans tend to do and then conflict between man and ape bubble and boil over to the point where we get the mind blowing, awesome stuff you've seen in the previews. This sequel is fantastic.Easily my favorite movie of the year,and let me tell you pretty people why.This is more than just a summer blockbuster with probably the best special effects I've ever seen and intensity to the max in it's action.It's a movie that has a LOT to say about stuff going on in our real world.There's heart wrenching drama,beautiful cinematography,and the best motion capture acting ever put on film. Andy Serkis plays Caeser who is probably a new favorite movie character of mine.He plays Caeser to perfection whether it be a touching scene or a scene where he's beating the snot out of someone. He oozes screen presence.Toby Kebbel plays Koba the scarred up scary ape from Rise and his performance was JUST as good as Serkis.The humans in the movie don't bring down the greatness of this movie.I thought Jason Clarke did really good as the lead human but it's the great Gary Oldman who plays my favorite human character.His performance when he's looking through tablet choked me up.The storytelling also makes this movie shine.This movie had me second guessing where it was gonna take things so for people saying this is gonna be like Avatar or Dances with Wolves WRONG! Matt Reeves' direction is superb, my favorite scene in the movie involves Koba and a tank.There's some incredible shots throughout.It almost reminded me of a big budget Walking Dead episode.The musical score is also very good.This is just a perfect all around Summer movie.I give this movie my highest recommendation. 10/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
299,arminhage,A clueless movie cut short,5,14 July 2014,"This movie suffered most from an important structural problem in its' screenplay. The hero of the movie ""Ceasar"" has no clear outer motivation, he is the leader of the tribe, he is basically after nothing but continue the status quo so the scenario has no enough thrust for the bulk of the movie because the hero has no apparent visible goal. He also lacks viable conflicts. He is stupid while Koba has a point. He truly knows if humans get their hands on power, they become stronger and they attack apes. First it was the hatred of humans which was thrusting Koba's actions in the story but then he was proved right. Ceasar never listened to Koba, and at one point attacked Koba and hit him hard to the point of death. So Ceasar estranged Koba who had a valid point. Under Caesar's leadership, apes were waiting for the humans to get stronger and attack them. Under Koba's leadership, apes attacked humans and won the war and Koba's conspiracy to kill Caesar was not the result of evil intentions or his appetite for power but for the benefit of ape nation. So Koba is nit the villain. He is a hero with dark side but Caesar is the stupid hero. Now despite these apparent fact, from the assassination of Caesar to the end of the movie, the screenplay tries in the cheesiest way to demonize Koba. So we have a stupid hero who has no outer motivation till near then end of the movie which his goal became the removal of Koba and return to power. We have a villain who is not really a villain and as result we do not have and sensible conflict between two characters. Also none of the humans fit into the category of hero or villains so the movie was about Caesar and Koba. There was another point. The poster of the movie shows a scene from the battle of apes and humans which does not exist in movie. The movie could use an additional 20 minutes of battle action but for obvious reason (Money, return on investment, guaranteed sell of franchise) cut short. I as a cinema goer feel cheated. I waited and waited and waited to see that bridge fell and when I least expected the movie to end, It ended. Overall a mediocre at best, some entertainment but grossly failed to elicit any emotion in viewer.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

For those of you who were blown away by it's predecessor, hold on to your jiggly bits because this next chapter in the apes saga packs just as hard a punch as the last one, maybe even more.

301,zofos,The Eyes Have It,9,23 July 2014,"I was very cautious about this sequel. When it was announced, I wondered how they could possibly top Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Then Rise director Rupert Wyatt bowed out and I had even more fears that it was going to be a Tim Burtonesque ape disaster. I needn't have worried. Matt Reeves has come in and done a superb job of directing. Fox also wisely kept Rise writers Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa on board. They started out writing movies like The Hand That Rocks The Cradle which was okay if derivative. There was no indication that they would have the capacity to write anything as layered as Rise or Dawn of the Planet of the Apes then. For me, they are the best screenwriters currently working in Hollywood and I'm not alone in thinking that. Steven Spielberg has hired them to write the new Jurassic Park movie Jurassic World while James Cameron has them working on two of the Avatar sequels. Praise from Caesar(s).The expert writing is old-school brilliant. It is patient, this is not a dumbed-down action movie to placate non-English-speaking markets. The story and characters have the complexity of a novel. Perhaps this will make movie studios see that audiences want intelligent movies that stand up to repeat viewing as Dawn will and not forgettable junk that's little more than chewing gum for the eyes.The crux of the story revolves around several power struggles. Ape leader Caesar, raised by kind humans, is struggling internally with his love for humans but also with their capacity for cruelty towards animals that he experienced first-hand in Rise. His second-in-command is Koba, a laboratory chimpanzee who was never shown the good side of humanity. As Koba puts it, he was caged and tortured and points to his scarred body as an example of ""human work."" He wants to wipe out all people. Koba is the embodiment of human guilt over our treatment of animals. He would be the villain of the piece but he was made so by humans and like all great villains, you see where he is coming from and you even slightly admire and like him until you remind yourself that he is a killer (Shakespeare did that with characters like Richard III). If animals did rise up against us, they would be totally justified in annihilating us as that is what we have done to them since the dawn of time. The power struggle on the ape side is reflected on the human side. Gary Oldman is the Koba of the humans; he fears apes, doesn't trust them and wants to obliterate them all. Oldman is only in the movie for about ten minutes at the start and end and you kind of wonder why a great actor is given such little screen time and so little to do. It was probably a marketing thing. He is the only real big name actor in this movie and they needed someone to put on the poster to sell it. The writers understand that drama is conflict and with these constant power struggles and hunting and war scenes, there is non-stop drama from start to finish in Dawn. The writers come to the fatalistic conclusion that however much the Doves on both sides try to placate the Hawks, the Hawks will get their war in the end.And get his war Koba does in spectacular fashion. The scene where Koba rides screaming on horseback through flames with two machines guns blazing is like something out of Scarface (the way the apes speak also has more than an echo of Tony Montana.) There is also a nod to The Godfather when Caesar just barely survives Koba's assassination attempt (with a name like Caesar, he was always going to be a target for that) and starts doling out sage counter-attack strategies to his underlings like Brando's Don Corleone did. When the apes set fire to the San Franciscan human enclave, it's hard not to push the Caesar analogy and see it as Rome burning.The directing, ape acting (especially the indispensable Andy Serkis) and special effects are also superb but, more importantly, they mesh together perfectly with the writing to push the whole thing to another level. The Motion-Capture or Mo-Cap has evolved to the point where they can finally do realistic CGI eyes (just look at how bad the eyes of Jabba The Hutt are in the 1997 Special Edition of Star Wars to see what I mean but it was 17 years ago and technology has moved on a hell of a lot since then). No longer are the eyes glassy-looking, hollow and fake. These ape eyes show concentration, emotion and depth. For the first time, there is believable consciousness behind the eyes. They even end the movie on an extreme close-up of Caesar's eyes, there's confidence for you and the effect stands up to scrutiny.The Charlton Heston ape movies had Orang-Utans (the politicians/clergy) using Gorilla muscle (the army) to suppress the liberal scientist Chimpanzees. Gorillas have been docile so far and will have to start morphing into their militaristic future selves in the already-planned next Apes movie. That goes for the Orang-Utans too (We see in Dawn that Maurice is clearly The Lawgiver of the Heston movies teaching young apes their commandment that ""Ape Shall Not Kill Ape."")I rarely want to see a movie a second time in the cinema but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of them. I was disappointed with X-Men: Days of Future Past, it was good but not great as I thought it would be. Edge of Tomorrow was okay but Dawn is the real deal. This will be looked on as a classic in future years and rightly so. It's thrilling to see a franchise so many of us grew up with being done better than the first time out.

303,Nothinggrandproductions,"A strong, riveting dramatic piece in a time when Hollywood desperately needs it",9,11 July 2014,"Hollywood isn't exactly in the greatest state anymore. Year after year we get reboot after reboot, prequel after prequel, and sequel after sequel. It's getting stale but people still continue to buy into it. But if there is one reboot/prequel/sequel that I want people to buy into, it's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the sequels to follow. The fact of the matter is that this new rebooted franchise and its two films have become some of the smartest films to come out of Hollywood as of recently. Both have an incredible balance of well-crafted action pieces and dramatic scenes and Dawn only emphasizes that more. Dawn takes place ten years after the original film and Caesar played wonderfully once again by Andy Serkis leads apes in a community, some of them being from the previous films (Koba, Rocket, and Maurice). Caesar is also married to Cornelia (Judy Greer) and they have a son named Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston). Everything actually seems fine for this community at first, they haven't seen humans in two winters according to one of the apes but they eventually run into a pack of humans who simply want to get power using a generator at the dam nearby the ape's community. This obviously leads to some serious problems with argumentation on both sides with humans vs. humans, humans vs. apes, and apes vs. apes. Though it also has a sense of empathy and understanding between some of the human and ape characters that made the Apes franchise what it was in the first place. The movie manages to craft together a riveting drama that never lets up and is incredibly entertaining and thrilling to watch for the entire run time and that in itself is great to see in a Hollywood blockbuster.It isn't just repetitive action scene after action scene instead the scenes have depth and wonderful cinematography as well. The action scenes can even be frightening to watch and are extraordinarily gripping and feel very similar to the scenes from the previous Apes' films: Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. But the scenes are even better in Dawn with the gorgeous CGI the movie has that makes these apes so utterly believable. The movie manages to throw allusions out to those sequels in a playful and smart way (especially with the very last shot of the film) instead of in a forceful way; it's genuine treat for fans of the franchiseas this entire film truly is.Dawn just makes me a happy film-goer. It makes me excited to go to see big budget movies again if they can actually be like this. The movie manages to explore real, serious conflict between these characters and give them strong emotional resonance without it seeming forceful and in the way; it feels real and honest and not hollow and shallow like so much is nowadays. It isn't cliché or contrived rather it is intelligent and absolutely engaging to watch on screen, the story is strong and so are the characters that inhabit this story. The characters are truly complex on both sides and aren't two-dimensional and it'd be almost impossible for the main set of characters to be two-dimensional with the conflict set upon them. As a whole, Dawn is an extremely violent, enveloping pushing Hollywood drama but it never leaves its science fiction or genre film roots, it manages to remember what it is while also giving something entirely engaging and unique in the realm of repetition, it is exactly what Hollywood needs right now. As a new fan of the Apes franchise (I just marathoned through each and every film fairly recently), this movie places second out of every single film with only the original being the better film mostly for the sole fact that the original film certainly had more interesting political/social commentary than this film really had but Dawn decided to move away from strong political commentary and went with a solely riveting drama and it worked. Oh I forgot to mention, Michael Giacchino's scorewow. That is all. Just incredible, I don't even need to talk about it more; best score of the year so far, just absolutely sweeping pieces of music.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The Sequel - ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" looked much more exciting in the trailers. I found it to be that and more. The movie plays well on the themes of Trust and Betrayal, and that without them – Tragic results can follow - a mirror to the start of conflicts and war throughout human history. The movie takes part 10 years following the events of the first. Andy Serkis, reprising his role as the Ape Caeser, via performance capture, now heads up the Apes. The virus from the first movie has resulted in the Death in what appears to be the majority of the human population. The remaining humans that are in San Francisco (location of the first movie) seek to get the power back (has been lost due to catastrophic events of the virus) on through a Dam in the Woods, where the Apes now reside. As mentioned, the themes of Trust and Betrayal are front and center. The Apes are very believable – A Visual Effect Nomination at the Oscars is a safe bet. At points during the movie, you may wish the Human Characters got more moments, but not underused enough to bring down the movie.

308,paq5528,A Chimp Could Have Made a Better Movie,6,7 August 2014,"After the success of the first installment, one would think that it would be easier to evoke sympathy for the apes, the humans, or even the circumstances of this movie. But the only thing I can be happy about is that no chimps were harmed in the making of this movie because they are mostly CGI.The CGI, although not perfect, is not bad. That's not my primary complaint, nor are any of the special effects the reason I rated this a very middling score. The humans are simply unlikable and you kinda want the apes to win throughout, since they seem to be the more sensible of the 2 groups. One of the opening scenes is with a human shooting and killing one of the apes because he was afraid, though the ape made no aggressive gesture. If someone killed your son, what would your reaction be? The apes make a decision far wiser than the one I would have preferred. Add to that the same character defies the truce agreement while the apes allow the humans to do something that benefits them only, and the wiser of the 2 groups is immediately seen. Humans could use some of that retrovirus to become smarter, because their actions throughout the movie again and again prove that they are the lesser race.There is a bright spot in the movie and that is the acting done by Caesar/Andy Serkis. He brought a very humane character to life, and certainly made him the hero of the film.The plot itself is stale. Humans live in a community where they state they have an energy crisis, but instead of seeming worried, every member seems fat and happy, and they have enough provisions to truck around the area without issues. The plot stated that they were running out of diesel, presumably for generators, however, since the world is lost, my guess is that there is a ton of fuel in trucks all over the area. But no, these humans have got to get to a dam, which evidently works on 1960s technology, doesn't offer any benefit to the apes, although the apes control that territory, and somehow half a city lights up after being in the dark 10+ years without anyone throwing on a switch, and without any dusty circuit breakers blowing. So this plot is extremely formulaic, without any human creativity -- introduce 2 groups fighting over some introduced conflict point, throw in some backstabbing and betrayal and some really poor leadership decisions, and voila! You have the plot for about every un-creative film ever created by Hollywood. Usually, you want the humans to win (you won't in this case), and usually there is a clear hero and villain (aside from Caesar, again, not the case). What you are left with is a bowl of porridge, unexciting in any way, and maybe even a little upset that someone had to expend energy in bringing you this poor dish.This film could have set up the humans versus apes in a much better way. It could have introduced internal conflict and competing self-interest better, it could have done a lot of things. But it didn't. And that's why this film deserves its mediocrity. If not for the passable CGI and some very good acting, this film could have been made better with chimps writing the plot and directing.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
309,oldman007,A modern art in the history of cinema.,9,20 July 2014,"I loved the film the moment it started. It instantly gives you the whole gist of the movie the second it starts. Apes against the humans and humans against the apes etc. it starts off with how the apes have been surviving up in the woods all these years. How they eat, hunt, how they are slowly starting to learn English and how they have developed their own way of speaking. It impressive, to say the least. You feel like these apes are real apes, and you feel for them every step of the way.It has been years since the humans have made any sort of contact with the apes and coming and touring their home. Caesar (played again by Andy Serkis) has started in his own family. His son and his new baby (which is just breathtaking to see the new baby being born) and all the apes have their own families and been working dang hard at surviving. One day, however, humans come along (lead by Aussie actor Jason Clarke) and they need to get into the mines to generate power into the city, for in the city they are losing power and need to get some power ASAP. Unfortunately it does not make it easy considering the fact that the mines are right where the apes have been living all this time. There is conflict between the apes and humans, but they start to begin to trust each other. Except one particular ape named Koba (played by Toby Kebbell) has hated humans from day one. He does not trust them. Koba had been tortured and almost skinned alive by the humans until Caesar freed him. Koba makes travels nonstop to the city and notices all the humans are keeping heavy armed guns and the main person in charge named Dreyfus (played by Gary Oldman) is not at all worried for killing all the apes if he has to. Trust begins to crumble and relationships are getting worse. The slowness of the battle begins to take its course.All in all, it was a fantastic flick and I would watch it again and again, and I hope it goes down in the history of Cinema as been the best film of 2014. Great effects, beautiful shots, fantastic acting (espeicially played by Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell. My only complaint is the human characters ever get a chance to show their side of the story. They had so much emotional stuff to tell, but in the end, it never went deep enough. The main focus was on the apes (maybe not a bad thing) and I think this film should have developed more on the humans. But, excluding that, this film is just breathtaking. An excellent example of what can happen to you when you love, hate and trust somebody. I highly recommend it. 9/10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
310,pendenquejohn,Too much attempt to moralize...,4,25 April 2015,"So this movie is about intolerance between people, this, if we continue top push the analogy until the end but also war of territory and lack of frontier between the resemblance between men/animals also, from a physical standpoint, monkeys and men. But that is probably what made me dislike this movie where I also reached to a certain boiling point, got completely bored and checked out before the end. So that leaves us with one or many problematic. The first one being the angle under which this movie was shot.It kind of reminds me a Voltaire like 'philosophical tale', a weaker version of that. You could sens the morale à la Jean De La Fontaine coming full speed at the end : unite and do not make war. While the premise is actually right, the movie in itself was quite predictable and cheap in that regards. I do not like the high-standard morale under which they shot this, trying to give people lessons of life because it really dries out the film throughout once the lesson was already assimilated half-way. What else was left then afterwards ?The other quite annoying arguments are the 'Monkeys are wiser than men, more diplomatic than men' etc. that you can read in certain scenes is quite preposterous too. Animals react to their natural instinct even if they have some part of intelligence, yet, this was very rarely represented and you even had the impression that the human beings present in the movie are the ones being savage and animals while the monkeys are completely the inverse for the most part [...] but also dominant where man would be under their mercy.The second. From a pure aesthetic standpoint, the movie is quite beautiful. The rendering and reactions of the apes is quite realistic though at times you could feel them being fake and overdone -; however globally it was good. But, the story is cheap. Even a five year old apprentice film writer could have come up with such a scenario. There is also literally no focus whatsoever on why part of the human race got exterminated and why are the monkeys dominating.I did not see the first part though but it would have been great to throw in some flashbacks like so many films do.That said, the flow of the movie is from an overall standpoint, dynamic but from my personal perspective, the main reaction that comes out off me is ""bored"". I lost attention quite quickly and especially at that first 'romantic' scene that tries and soften the spectator. I found it to be heavy redundant and cliché'd to an underwhelming maximum.At last, certain characters are as useless and invisible as sun in full and bright daylight. Kodi Smith-McPhee is the case in point of somebody who just does not find his place in the movie. He's even painted as some kind of dumb retarded person whose only dialogues are 'Is he OK ? ; Is he going to survive ?' yet, he does play an ""essential"" role in the movie as he appears in way too much scenes for what he globally does.Jason Clarke's acting can be perceived in both ways. Sometimes he simply was not credible and looked scared -; and even when he tried to look scared, he did not look scared. I hardly really perceived his emotions when he was trying to convey them.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
311,SatiagoManez,Action drama with man-wild emotions .,6,25 July 2014,The movie briefs the two ways of living with Man and Apes in the first half. The Apes are isolated themselves in the forest from the humans colonized. The humans in abandoned cities with decreasing resources day by day. When it happens when some man happens to enter the forest and make contact to the Apes one shoots down one of the ape in panic. The leader of the Ape has family values and peace on top of the rivalry and sends them back. The story begins there and travels through a series of events involving trust and Anti trust between humans vs apes and also within the same species.The second half keeps you occupied with the action sequences but there is no suspense element of what will happen next in the movie that will keep the audience in the edge of the seat. With especially betraying clever traitor Koba on the characters it could have been any way the story could have been taken but it was taken in a very predictable way. There was some intelligence in the climax making path for the sequel .,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
312,alucard_castlevania86,Great Movie With A Nice Twist,7,20 July 2014,"I got bored at home and decided to go and give this movie a shot. I didn't watch the first one on the big screen and only got it on DVD so in a way I had very little idea what the movie was about. However, after watching the film, it was quite good not one of my top 5 but definitely in the top 10At first I was wondering if this was a reboot or a remake since I really expected the character Will (James Franco) to return if it were a sequel. Sadly, I was proved wrong and it was a sequel without Franco returning. I really liked his character and really wished he would end up meeting Caeser again sine the chemistry that they had were very touchingThe movie was quite long but the story was well told, pretty unique and questions ones trust and faith that he puts in others. Jason Clarke plays his role verywell as Malcolm and he but I wasn't much into his character in the movie. Keri Russell in my opinion puts on a more convincing performance than Clarke and she really helped build up a lot of tension to the film. Gary Oldman was also good for his part as a politician type kind of guy trying to keep everyone together from panickingThe twist during the film was really the surprising moment from me but in a way, half way through the film, I could already see it coming. Another thing is that there was not much 3D effects to see in the film so I would recommend sticking to the regular 2D tickets. Overall, the movie was rather enjoyable and I hope they'll make more improvement on the sequel",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
313,MacTheMovieguy,Serkis has to act by commanding stillness,10,23 July 2014,"Family.This movie is about family. Caesar has a family, in a large sense, because he watches over a colony of apes. He also has a family. A son, a wife, and a newborn. His former foe Rocket also has a family. Jason Clarke has a family too. He has Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee. He has a slightly larger family, which includes the other men who go out on runs with him. Then he has his human camp family, which consists of a few hundred survivors that have held up in the city.It's about what you would do to keep your family safe. Not just alive, but safe. Caesar understands that. Clarke understands that. Their families keep them grounded, and keep them thinking about safety first.Koba does not have a family. Koba is evil.Gary Oldman does not have a family. Gary Oldman is evil.I mean, sure, they have the family in the larger sense. They have their community. But neither of them have a wife or children to ground them like the other characters. The film is sending a subtle message that not having a wife and kids will somehow cause you to slowly unravel, and become unstable. Koba moreso than Oldman. You could even call Oldman a situational villain. He's a guy who is a villain by circumstance, and probably a rather nice guy the rest of the time.It's important to note that the other human identified as a ""bad guy"", also never mentions a family. Rather, it is suggested that he lost his.The humans are almost an after thought in this film. They are slightly underdeveloped, but I think it credits the strength of the Apes when you would rather see them on camera than actual actors. The plot of the film revolves around the spread of the Simian Flu (what Tyler Labine's character, Franklin, had in the first film). It has spread worldwide. There were wars. Billions died. Now, a few survivors are held up in San Fransisco, trying to get the lights to come on.Caesar has built a strong community. They even have a little camp, with huts and structures to keep themselves out of the rain. He's teaching them to write, read, and talk. Caesar is not the only ape who talks in this movie, and he can now speak sentences, albeit sounding a bit like a caveman. I'm excited about the possibilities of the third film, and where they'll take us.Andy Serkis is brilliant as Caesar. Absolutely brilliant. You need to understand that he is actually standing there, where Caesar is standing, in every frame. He moves like Caesar, like an Ape. He did countless hours of research, watching apes interact with each other, in order to master this performance. Some actors get nominated for Oscars, and their performance was only a few minutes of work. Maybe a few days of shooting. Serkis doesn't just deserve an Oscar, he demands an Oscar.I understand how difficult it must be for the Academy to recognize this, so I've decided he should just get an honorary Oscar. I know he's not deathly old, but he still deserves recognition for the body of work he has created as a motion-capture actor. And for what it's worth, Toby Kebbel is pretty brilliant as Koba too. Sometimes, it's easier to play crazy, and play the villain, than it is to be quiet, and just command the scene with silence. Often, Serkis has to act by commanding stillness, whereas Koba acts through a gruff growl, or a sneer. Koba is anything but still and quiet, he is treacherous and dangerous in every frame.My favorite films of 2014 so far have all been summer releases. Dawn Of the Planet Of The Apes joins those ranks, and is quite possibly the best film of 2014 so far (that I've seen). My top 4 are all summer sequels. Dawn took the impossibly strong foundation in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, and built on it a more fully realized world, with even greater developed characters. Those characters are apes. The fact that you can pull that much emotion out of computer generated imagery goes to show how great the motion capture talent is. Maybe one day, they'll have their own Oscar category. For now, I just have to say Bravo, and hope Serkis gets his due.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Not as good as the prequel (Rise of the..)",8,3 December 2014,"This movie is flawless but something is missing to be able to call it epic.The pace and tone of the movie are very engaging. Viewing both sides, people and apes alike creates a wonderful engagement where you start caring for both sides. Honestly you care for the apes more than you do humans. And can relate to both sides as well.This movie is great in how it portrays the apes. The graphic is incredible. You can sense their emotions.I like the plot a lot! I also like the casting job. Keri Russell was the best casting choice of the movie. She adds the female touch perfectly where it is needed. Leading actor was OK. And Gary Oldman, I was not impressed. In the latter stage of his career he always brings this gray, ""proper"" character to the screen.Movie is enjoyable, but seriously lacks some witty moments and it also isn't great enough to be epic.

315,Incendid,One of the better films of the year!,8,11 July 2014,"Ciaran: When i walked into cinemas i was expecting a typical sequel, and a plot building up to a third film, i was 50% correct, i am not going to spoil any vital plot details, but i will say this, the whole film is here to show the transition the world has made after the world has undergone a global pandemic and how the survivors live now, but the movie also focuses on the apes and their lives in the Redwood forests outside San Fransisco, the film tries to give the humans and apes equal screen time, although i did notice the apes managed to gain a smidgen more than the humans, but considering the title of this movie, it is probably the appropriate move, this move also managed to create a movie that was enjoyable. First, the acting, our lead characters Ceaser (Andy Serkis) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke)both maintained a great performance throughout the film, the film also had a supporting cast made up of Keri Russel and Gary Oldman, (and that is only naming a few) who both gave a good performance, although i did feel that Oldman's character was a bit preachy, it also seemed that his character's morals were muddled but this may have been a simple mistake somewhere in the story. Other than that issue i enjoyed the acting. The film was quite normal when it came to the styles Matt Reeves used to convey the story, to be brief i didn't find the directing to be anything special. Now onto CGI, and i can say it looked amazing for the most part, the apes looked amazing but any other animal such as deers, not so amazing, now i know the budget has to go to the important things but maybe just before releasing the film just touch those effects up a little. To conclude, the ending to this movie was pretty good, but has now left us on a cliffhanger to see the next movie. I hope to watch the 3rd movie in 2016 and i can say i recommended you watch Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. My final rating 8/10.Jacob's Review: This movie is an epic experience and the best film to be released this summer if you can take chimpanzees with machine guns on horseback seriously. The problems that arise with the film are only minor. Firstly, the dialogue can be occasionally weak, in fact, the weakest part about the movie is the human element, again. It is improved however through more motivated performances with real conflict and struggle. The lead, Malcolm, I originally thought was just another Aaron Taylor Johnson type but it is more passionately acted so the need for more depth and complexity can be side-noted. Gary Oldman plays a character who I originally thought was going to be the generic Avatar bad guy who is just blinded by unguided prejudice but that was replaced with a character who you can relate and understand why he is going to great lengths to protect his people. The direction is slick and the scenery is gorgeous. The real achievement is the special effects, action and ape element. The CGI is beautiful but every computer based performance for a bear looks incredibly fake. This is a CGI heavy film but it would be worthless if it didn't have an emotional core that drives the film. The action is enthralling and motion capture presentation is great. Andy Serkis as Caesar gives a complex and heart-felt performance as well as his ape cohorts, especially Koba, the villain. Koba is a disgusting and abhorring character and it is great to see him getting his ass kicked. This is the Dark Knight to the Batman Begins, The Empire Strikes Back to Star Wars and deserves a 9/10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
316,timmyhollywood,Fantastic. Pay no attention to the hate.,9,9 July 2015,"What an epic movie. Full of heart and spectacular cinematic moments. Top filmmaking. I can hardly wait for more.I'm not sure what to make of all the negative reviews. Certainly everyone is as entitled their opinion as I am to mine. Suffice it to say, if realism is your biggest concern, maybe a movie about apes taking over the planet is not for you. There are lots of how-to documentaries on survivalism and end-of-world scenarios. Yes, movie-guns often expel more rounds than real guns. Sorry, some dialog and emotional interaction was warranted for the narrative build up. The storyline may have deviated from your expectations, or from the lore of the original movies - though those vintage films did have people wearing rubbery ape masks that jiggled when they talked. So I think this is an improvement. Oh and more good news: with all the CGI, the preponderance of violent explosions was not real. For films that burn through natural resources, see the Fast and Furious franchise or anything with Jason Statham.Cheers to the writers and actors and all the craftspeople and artists involved in this film. Bravura performances, outstanding soundtrack, a fantastic film all around. Thank you.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
317,sunshinebeachcinema,"An entertaining film with a decent story and characters, and special effects at the top of their game.",8,6 April 2015,"As an unashamed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films (which I once picked up for under a fiver), I am more than happy to enjoy this Sequel to the Reboot of the Remake of the Planet of the Apes. What's been delivered is another entertaining film; almost, but not quite the equal of its predecessor, with a decent story and characters, and special effects at the top of their game.This is the eighth film in a franchise rich with possibilities, which has always reflected the concerns of society, from nuclear war, slavery and segregation in the 1960s and 70s, to the 21st Century concerns of animal testing, genetic engineering, global pandemics and our relationship with the environment, always with the chilling edge that comes from displacing humanity from its comfortable position as the planet's dominant species.As a quasi-prequel to the first Planet of the Apes (1968), we get to see this process in action as we return to the titular planet (spoiler: it's Earth!) some years after the aforementioned pandemic which appeared as the end sequence of Rise, killing 90% of the human population. With no humans seen for some time, the thought in the now thriving society led by ape liberator Caesar is that the last survivors have perished, but a chance encounter on a hunting expedition reveals the truth.An expedition of humans has ventured deep into ape territory with the intention of restarting a hydroelectric dam to restore power to the ruins of San Francisco. With a deep mistrust of humans at the very core of ape doctrine, the plan becomes a tense diplomatic mission as the humans and apes negotiate to avoid another brutal conflict and needless loss of life.Caesar is played by master of motion capture Andy Serkis and amazingly, the motion capture was largely filmed on location in the forests of Vancouver, the CGI seamlessly integrated with live action. As a character, Caesar is rare among apes in that he was raised by a human and can see the good in them.Our human hero is Malcolm (Jason Clarke), a survivalist and engineer, who is in charge of the expedition, but is not much of a leader. Neither is he a diplomat, but he is level headed enough to develop a relationship with Caesar, with whom they share a common goal which transcends the interspecies squabble – each has a family they would do anything to protect.The real leader of the humans is back in San Francisco: the militaristic but pragmatic Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who has already lost his family (he swipes through their pictures on a prominently placed iPad – in shops now!) and has little desire to understand or relate to the apes.The previous director Rupert Wyatt is replaced here by Matt Reeves, who gave us found footage monster movie Cloverfield, where the tantalising excitement of citywide destruction just off-screen was undermined by the idiotic decisions made by the protagonists. There are shades of this frustrating characterisation here with one member of Malcolm's team, Carver.He is nothing more than a catalyst; right from the opening scene, where he shoots first and thinks later, wounding Caesar's son Blue Eyes in the process, everything about him screams ""I'm the arsehole who's constantly going to jeopardise this fragile diplomacy"" – which is barely saved from the brink of collapse more than once before the inevitable final showdown.Koba fills this role for the apes, but he is a stronger character and an established personal rival of Caesar, who tries to corrupt the younger apes, including Cesar's impressionable young son Blue Eyes.We also remember the dramatic ""No!"" – The first words spoken by an ape in both Conquest and Rise, when Caesar flexes his vocal chords to deliver an ultimatum to the humans, but the apes here tend to converse in sign language amongst themselves. Perhaps they see spoken language as a hallmark of humanity, but they prefer to save their English skills to dramatically intimidate humans, reminding them that they share a level of intelligence which apes may even have surpassed with their sense of community. While the apes have built a new society from the ground up, the surviving humans continue to scavenge in the ruins of their decaying civilisation, relying on old technology.There's a great scene about halfway through the film. Power is restored to an old petrol station in the woods, and as it flickers into life a song plays from a stereo: The Weight by The Band, a song which is both religious allegory and an exploration of the music which flows from the American South. Its thematic relevance extends to include references to Judgement Day and the American civil rights movement.Hearing recorded music and seeing artificial light, symbolic of humanity's legacy, offers a spot of hope, which is inevitably undercut by the melancholy of the world lost and the inevitability of an impending finale, which I'm going to talk about now, so stop reading to avoid spoilers. Hey, I've already told you that they managed to get the power back on so Gary Oldman can charge his iPad.The audience wants a fight, we've paid to see apes with machine guns, and a fight is what we get, courtesy of the hot headed Koba and unrelenting Dreyfus. Lamentably although hell inevitably breaks loose, credibility is stretched. The previously pacifist apes are far too good at using the machine guns they have only recently stolen from the humans.We know the apes have both intelligence and physical strength on their side, but it's hard to explain hold their own so well against the trained human guards. Ultimately, they overwhelm the humans with sheer numbers, when they might have concocted a strategic assault using some kind of unique and established ape advantage, such as their non verbal communication, or climbing ability.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
318,JamieClay,Surprisingly disappointed,4,1 January 2015,"Having enjoyed the ""Rise"" film, I was looking forward to seeing this sequel, even saved it to watch on New Year's eve - end the year with a bang so to speak. Little did I expect it to be such a bomb. At least for us, which is why we were so surprised. We had heard nothing but good things about this film and were sorry we missed it in the theaters. (We rarely go to theaters anymore)**Nothing but spoilers**The main tension of this film surrounds the surviving humans living in a decaying San Francisco wanting access to a long abandoned hydroelectric power facility in Marin (Ape) County. OK, for the sake of argument let's say there is such a thing; the humans are in San Francisco. Somehow this abandoned plant is still tapped into the power grid and can direct that power only to S.F.? Keep in mind that S.F. and the peninsula are a couple of Meccas for Solar Energy use. In 10 years has Solar power become nonviable? In another plot motivation - they need the power to call the outside world for help with their survival. They have running cars, there are no doubt generators that still function in hospitals or motor homes and such, why would they need the main power grid to run a radio? Plus it's been 10 years and NOW they want to contact 'the outside world'? (Obvious setup for the next film)Now here we have the desperate and electricity-ignorant humans crossing over to Marin (Ape) county (that has a wealth of solar powered homes that actually feed into the grid) to 'discover' a colony of smart apes is blocking their way to the abandoned power facility. The Apes warn them to stay away but ignorant 'power hungry' humans come anyway – war ensues. This is one of the main reasons it fell flat for us. The story was SO weak the only reason to watch the film comes down to seeing the amazing visual effects – and that's the reason I gave this 4 stars, the Ape work is outstanding. Other technical nits to pick (what the heck)1) How was it apes are such good shots when they first pick up the guns? And how is it the guns seem to have an inexhaustible supply of ammunition? 2) Why have the remaining humans congregated in unplugged S.F.? Marin (Ape) County (or Napa or Sonoma counties) would have made more sense as there are farms and beautiful solar powered homes and facilities. 3) Why did the survivors build the gated fortress? (if they didn't know of the mean apes) Was that to defend against bad humans? If so where are they? 4) How did the human survivors go 10 years and not know about the rising Ape population?5) How quickly do ape populations grow? Man there were a lot of them.6) (super nitpicking) The poster for the film is for the most part unrelated to the story. The apes are not in Oakland, the bay bridge (for all we know) is still intact. I really hope for the next film they manage to write a stronger story but I certainly won't waste my time seeing it in the theater.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
319,six2561,"Worth the money, you will enjoy it.",9,12 July 2014,"This movie was great. The right balance of action, adventure, suspense, drama & human interest. Not overdone ad-nausea with the cgi. And outstanding cgi at that. I am still unsure... Is Caesar, his son, Koba, all the main apes ..all cgi all the time?? It's remarkable! No psychedelic/funkydelic clothes on these monkeys. These are apes in the wild who learned how to communicate with each other and some with humans using their voice. Visually stunning at times. I am a child of the 60's and I was dragged to this movie by my husband-- kicking and screaming-- and ended up loving it! One of the best movie we've seen all year.

320,robo8,Generic beyond words,5,13 February 2015,"I first gave it four stars, but had to come to my senses and slap another star there. It is well made, fantastic CGI that, like Avatar, mostly don't take you out of the movie. Also settings and music are very well put together, with overall good acting performances.But – oh my god is it generic! If you are young or for some other reason haven't devoured a lot of films, this might not be a problem. But if you've plowed through a fair amount of movies, there is no surprise in this one whatsoever.About fifteen minutes into the movie I have the plot narrowed down, which characters will do what and roughly how it will end. You've got a sensible human man with his sensible wife, and a sensible ape with his sick wife and scarred son. They are teamed up with a trigger-happy ape-hating human on one side and a war-mongering ape on the other. Hmm wonder what will happen? Yes, exactly that will happen and nothing else.This kind of stuff frustrates me and I hope it is not as obvious to you, cause then you'll probably enjoy this movie. But to most movie buffs, I'm afraid this one is just too generic to carry any surprises and ends up being just taking an old walk in a newly painted environment.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
321,natsuka_arei,Horrible with the plot but give us lesson about war,4,16 December 2015,"I should say, i'm disappointed with the movie. I have high expectation since it have high rating and people told me this was a great movie ( honestly i don't watch the rise of the planet apes, yet. So, i don't compare it from the first one ). At first impression, i was amazed by hoe good the CGI was ( okay, for graphic i will give two thumbs up ). However, for the story itself..i don't appreciate it too much ( all the bad reviews about this movie have sum it up ). Like, too many plot holes,things that was not logically fit in ( like the unlimited ammo without the need to reload the gun ) and a ridiculous ending. Yes, for the ending...i want to complain about it so much. I can tolerate the first hour i've watched ( well,the story wasn't that bad, just too common, illogical ). I give four for the score, mainly because of the ending. Why until the end, the human and the ape can't make up and war is unavoidable? The protagonist ( the human ) just leave the ape to face the war that will begin. Then what? The cycle of war is not stopped, thus will only bring sadness and grieve. I understand, maybe it will look Impossible to gain peace because even if the apes and the main protagonist ( i called the the minority ) want peace, the soldiers won't hear or understand it. I think in society, if the majority won't seek for understanding, the minority can't do much , just struggle in hope, that someday the peace can be brought back. It is logical, but i desperate to see a better ending.. i was desperate to see that even the minority can bring impact and somehow influence the majority and thus change the course of the story. Lead it to a happy ending. That, was the kind of ending i was hoped for.However, i think i got the point of this movie. I see the movie was trying to depict the reason why wars can happen in our life. Human, apes, or any other species in this world will someday be extinct if we can't have some senses and understanding between others! The war will happen and only bring us suffering, hatred, death, sadness, etc. In the end, i think this movie try to teach us the need of trust and understanding in order to maintain balance. I wish people in the world that has watched this movie can try to think for themselves and realize the importance of tolerance and understanding, thus will lead us to a better life and avoid the war.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
322,Arconada,Entertaining and technically impressive but no direction,7,8 November 2014,"I must say, I enjoyed this movie. It is impressive to see a world full of cgi environments and cgi animals, almost as good as the real thing. To enjoy this story you will have to accept the premise that apes get intelligent, and to also see the developments of struggle for power behind the back of the protagonist. Just like humans, isn't it. However, the story does not go anywhere. I mean, we know how it starts, it is explained in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and we know how it ends as explained in ""Planet of the Apes"", so this should be an intermediate part of the saga. But the only thing we learn is what we already learned from the previous film, which is that humans and apes don't get along. In the final film of the saga it is shown that humans get to be submissive, tamed and exploited by the apes, but this transition is not yet made in this movie. That's a missed opportunity, I think. It could have added some spice to the plot.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
323,nick-sultana,A Great Sequel & A Top Film for 2014,10,13 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was promoted to be a bigger, better and even yet more epic than its last film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, in which was the reboot of the franchise) and with the great direction of Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), a truly well chosen cast consisting of Jason Clarke, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Andy Serkis and Tody Kebbell and backed up by a great story of emotion, survival and action. Dawn of Apes succeeds to be a worthy sequel of the series by far and it overthrows the previous installment.The story takes place years after the climatic events of 'Rise' where human life has now become fragile and seems to have nearly wiped out its kind off Earth, while Apes seems to have a place called home among the destroyed human life, with many of their kind in peace and lead truly by leader Caesar. The relationship between Man and Ape here is dangerous, broken and untrustworthy but it may have a chance to reconcile when humans offer for help in getting resourceful power for their collapsed city from the Ape's homeland, dry of resources to survive. At first, it seems unlikely for the humans but Caesar is keen to help them under the promise that they leave his kind alone. What follows next is a battle of emotion, trust, redemption and even determines the future race of both sides; they will face each other with personal experiences, discovered power and fight on till the end.What I really enjoyed about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the fact that it takes the concept of survival further than what Rise of Apes did, Reeves having experienced a sci-fi adventure themed films such as Cloverfireld brings the bleak vision of collapsed civilization, showing the humans as broken spirited but determined to survive while the apes are seen as powerful but face problems of their own as much as the humans undergo. Emotion plays a big part along the apes and human character, showing who is good, bad or even undecided, and Reeves as well brings some big action sequences half way of the film, that makes the tension break further than what it has done already.Performances here are truly phenomenal and it features some amazing character work from Clarke (in his first leading role for once), McPhee, Russell and Oldman. The ape characters again are truly amazing and are taken slightly further here, with Serkis giving another powerhouse performance as Caesar. Acclaimed visual effects team WETA Workshop help provide the film some truly beautiful yet realistic motion-capture effects of the apes, which proves both to audiences and the film-making industry that they are truly award worthy and are the best in what they do, and Serkis brings an important role in proving motion capture performance along with Kebbell and co. The music score here is composed by Michael Giacchio (Star Trek Into Darkness, The Incredibles and Speed Racer), he brings both an epic and intense score in the vein of Hans Zimmer's work. Lastly the script has a lot of major qualities that could be even considered for awards, showcasing some great moments of tension, heart, action and even bravery that the characters undergo.Summarise, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is truly a spectacular sequel and as well a box-office hit for winter (Summer for the Americans) and it should get enough attention from the fans of the reboot and even the original film series.Facebook 'MovieNerd91' for my reviews :)http://movienerd91.weebly.com/",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
324,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,2014's The Dark Knight,10,12 July 2014,"If there would be one film to compare Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to, it would have to be The Dark Knight, in which it is a sequel to a fantastic film that manages to out-do the film it was proceeded by. As far as Summer Blockbusters go, this is one of the best I've seen in the last decade. It has the epic action set pieces and incredible CGI that we've come to expect, But also a great story, fantastic performances, and emotional depth that many of these Summer films are missing. A majority of the dialogue between the Apes are translated in English subtitles as they communicate with Sign-Language, which was a very ambitious move by the filmmakers as that element alone could easily turn-off some audiences. While there is no doubt the technical aspect of the film is highly impressive, it also succeeds outside of it as well in telling a survival story between the Apes and remaining Humans on earth. The film doesn't take any sides between the two species portraying them equally both having their protagonists and antagonists. We don't find ourselves rooting for either side, but rather sympathizing with both of them. Their some beautiful and incredibly touching moments of the Apes and Humans connecting with each other throughout the film, creating a great sense of dread and intensity considering the dramatic irony of the events to come later in the film. Despite these moments being the more quiet and peaceful in this extremely dark film, it makes them all the more tough to watch. The human characters in the film are portrayed very well. While the relationship between Ceaser and Jason Clarke's character isn't quite as strong as his and James Franco's character in the previous film, it doesn't hurt the connection between the two's relationship at all still hitting an emotional chord among the viewer. The action sequences are absolute breathtaking including a great battle sequence and fist-fight between two Ape characters during the climax. It's only a little over halfway through the year, but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best film I've seen so far this year. It's an intense, emotional, and thought-provoking films that is not only impressive on a technical level, but in film making generally.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
325,samadabbasi,Truly a masterpiece,10,2 August 2014,"I just arrived from the cinema after seeing the movie and I'm amazed.Matt Reeves has managed to make one hell of a 2 hour 10 minutes adventure, that is one of the year's best so far.It was totally awesome.I walked into cinema with so many expectations, I knew it was going to be amazing.It happened and the movie was perfect.The CGI is so perfect that one can hardly make difference between visual and virtual.Also Andy Serkis is the best part of the movie.Storyline is great. All of the actors are great in the movie, a very good cast.It is sad, thrilling, scary, funny, adventurous and stunning at the same time.Summing up, It is definitely worth paying money to see it on big screen.It is the best apes movie I have ever seen.I would love to see it again and you should go see it. Also waiting anxiously for the next part.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
326,scottjohnson7896,Surpasses its Predecessor (Raging FIlm Review),9,9 August 2014,"Who would have thought that a sequel to a prequel after a failed remake would end up being one the best movies of the summer? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes what its predecessor started and turns it into one of the best summer movies in years. We pick up ten years after the first film. The apes have settled into their home in the forests while the humans have fought and tried to survive the Simian Flu as well as the fighting caused from the depletion of resources after the population dropped. For ten years the apes have lived in peace aside from the occasional run-in with humans that are briefly alluded to. The apes have a good society; they hunt for food, they have become advanced enough to make weapons and ride horses, they teach their young, and most importantly, they live in happiness. Things change, though, when a group of humans show up looking to use a nearby dam for power. After some disputes and a confrontation in the human settlement, the apes allow for the humans to access the dam.It is interesting how the writers paralleled the lives of humans and apes. Both are just trying to survive, both have lost loved ones, and both are skeptical about combining the two species even if it is minimal. The humans, who are led by a man named Dreyfus, played by Gary Oldman, are becoming exceptionally desperate for survival. They are quicker to assume the apes mean harm and often threaten them before the apes threaten them. The apes too are hesitant, mostly an ape by the name of Koba, an ape from the first film, who has many scars from ""human work."" His skepticism leads him to find out that the humans plan on assaulting the apes, but he knows that Caesar, the hero ape from the first film and leader of their civilization, will not stand for initiating violence. This begins a conflict that will eventually divide the apes in deciding who is right to follow.The film, which runs a little over two hours, feels far too short, which is usually a sign that the movie is good. There is not a dull moment in it. From the start, the tension keeps the film running. You never know when it's going to crack and turn into a full-out war. The human characters are relatable. Malcolm, played by Zero Dark Thirty's Jason Clarke is a man who sees something remarkable in the apes. He tries to befriend them instead of killing them. His wife was killed, and all he has is his son, played by Kodi Smit-Mcphee, and Ellie, played by Keri Russell, who has lost a daughter. Everyone is a victim in this film, which makes the consequences so much more dire. Though the humans are interesting, most of them do not hold a huge role in the film, especially Oldman's character who is depicted as the villain in trailers but is missing largely from the film itself.While the human acting is solid as can be, it is good that they are written interesting enough for us to keep focus when what we really want are the apes. The apes are fascinating to watch. While it is a little disorienting to see them talking at first, they are very sophisticated. The motion capture and detail in the apes is phenomenal. They appear almost real in some sequences, and it is very hard to distinguish reality from CGI. This can all be credited to the talented team of motion-capture actors including Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell, Nick Thurston, and many more. With motion-capture like this, it is brightening the future for better technology and ways in which to use it to enhance films.There are numerous fantastic set-pieces. From the decaying San Francisco, to the ape sanctuary, to the tops of skyscrapers, to the battles in the streets, they are nothing short of spectacular. Each action-sequence seems to top the previous, especially the climactic battle sequences in the heart of the city with apes on horses. Yes, you heard me. And no, it is not funny like you would see in a YouTube video, it is actually quite terrifying because of how closely it resembles the original film series.In many ways this film feels like (as the reviews have said) Star Wars. But to me it felt more like The Two Towers than Empire Strikes back. Sure it is easy to say that the film is like Star Wars in a way that the first film could have been a standalone film left open-ended for a sequel. Yet this film feels more like Two Towers because it has that impending doom feel like Lord of the Rings. We still know the end-game for this series of prequels, but any of these films could be enough to leave the rest open for interpretation and speculation. Yet, as good as the previous one did, and as well as this one will surely do, we will be treated to more installments that fill in the missing pieces. All I can say is, bring it on.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best movie of the summer thus far. It combines fantastic CGI and motion capture with an extremely tense story, excellent battle scenes, and the feeling of impending doom for a film that exceeds its predecessor on all fronts. If you have not seen this film, I beg you to do so.For more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
327,michael-sengwah,"Home, Family and Future Make it Emotional",8,11 July 2014,"Family and trust are two huge themes that play an essential role in this sequel, making it one of the most successful and emotional summer blockbusters this year behind Days of Future Past. Director Matt Reeves is able to embrace the challenge to maintain the epic strength from Rise of the Planet of the Apes and deliver good story, though slightly underwhelming strong human-apes relationship and a bit of overlong in the first half of the film. The plot itself is pretty straightforward, ventures in four main aspects - home, family, war and future; predictable but full with moral values. The apes are mimicking human by having the same personality which indirectly let audiences to see our own real personality from what had happened among the apes this time. Although the climax does not seems to be extremely exciting, the most successful move of this film is to hire Michael Giacchino as the composer who has contributed both horror and emotional types of scores to enhance the darker tone of the film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
328,ariasisaac-89085,Impressive CGI not much else.,3,25 September 2021,"It's better than the Previous film, but lacks any kind of Substance.

329,SforSmile,Ape-tastic!,7,17 August 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the latest installment of the Planet of the Apes Sci-Fi series that over the years earned a cult status in cinema due to its never outdated allegorical significance and exotic, dystopian world in which our closest animal relatives, the apes, hold up a mirror to us as mankind. This time we are presented with the simian leader's effort to maintain peace between his species and the last surviving humans, until the dynamics of mistrust, fear and hatred dash any good intentions and pave the way for a belligerent conflict that culminates in an action-packed, visually impressive and emotionally gripping finale that offers some extraordinary beautiful scenes in terms of cinematography and camera work, which are very artistically ambitious and constitute a great deal of the attraction of this movie. The story itself, although following traditional and therefore somewhat predictable patterns, is well-paced and atmospherically dense, managing to arouse interest for the characters, and most of all it has the merit of having a message rather than just being a framework for sensational action. Only a certain inaccuracy on part of the script authors - for example the exact number of the simian group seems to vary from scene to scene - and some inconsistencies concerning character development as well as issues with logic and physics, and unfortunately a notable fluctuation in authenticity of the CGI effects, which sometimes slightly mar the magic of watching real apes talking, prevent this Sci-Fi gem to be a true master piece. Nevertheless, it's a very strong and entertaining continuation of the franchise and worth a visit to the theaters.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
330,erolsabadosh,Disappointing at best,5,11 July 2014,"Compared to Rise of the Planet of the Apes this film is a huge disappointment. The cliché ridden script is tiresome and often gets in the way of enjoying the film as the action grinds to a complete halt and drags with little exciting character development. While the plot and the interactions between the humans and the apes is predictable the visuals are fresh and often spectacular. The battle scenes towards the end of the film hit a high note with stunningly crafted moments of carnage and destruction, but without a convincing emotional centre and a hackneyed plot the journey feels nowhere near as worthwhile or harrowing as that of Rise of Planet of the Apes, which built suspense masterfully towards a wholly satisfying and engaging conclusion, something which this film fails to do. It doesn't draw you in and instead relies heavily on special effects to create interest, and while there is no doubt that the initial forest scenes in the first act and the sheer marvel of destruction in the third act make for some serious eye candy, the middle of the film sags unbearably and makes you wish it was at least thirty minutes shorter. Andy Serkis does a wonderful job bringing the ape leader Caesar to life but it's Toby Kebbell as the lead villain Koba who really steals the show with a menacing complexity brought to the character. Aside from some truly incredible special effects there is little here to savour, which is a shame because the previous film was a great blend of intelligent thrills and emotional resonance.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
331,mistercsays1,"Great Effects, but Lacks Substance",6,15 July 2014,"As an avowed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films and the 2011 reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it was with some anticipation that I awaited this latest instalment in the prequel series. Maybe I had my expectations too high, or maybe the film is just missing that something special, but I left the cinema feeling a little underwhelmed. Of course, the motion capture effects are amazing, the post-apocalyptic atmosphere is suitably bleak (power supplies have almost been exhausted and the human populace is in panic mode) and there is action aplenty, which might very well be the problem. You see, as strange as it may seem given that the majority of characters are apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is very typical in both its characterisations and narrative structure.Directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up the story 10 years after the events of the previous film with the vast majority of the earth's population having been wiped out; either by the ALZ-113 virus or the violence that broke out as panic set in. A group of survivors have etched out an existence amongst the remnants of what was once San Francisco, but fuel supplies have been exhausted and an alternate power source must be found. Meanwhile, in the forests north of the city, the burgeoning ape population is living peacefully under the rule of Caesar (Andy Serkis), a benevolent dictator of sorts. When a group of humans led by Malcolm (Australia's Jason Clarke) head into the forest in an effort to repair a dam that could potentially generate power for the city, conflict ensues. Despite the best efforts of Caesar and Malcolm to hash out a peaceful co-existence between the two groups, ignorance and distrust abounds and the tensions escalate. There are the requisite bad guys on each side – Gary Oldman's Dreyfus for the humans and the scarred Koba (Toby Kebbell) for the apes – whose actions ultimately result in war between the two groups.The attitudes and actions of key characters are a reflection of what has been happening around the world for as long as we can remember. Koba's experiences in captivity have left him with a bitter hatred of all humans, an attitude that reflects ways in which certain groups today (such as the Islamic community) are marginalised because of the actions of a few. Dreyfus, on the other hand is of the arrogant belief that they are ""just apes"" and thereby don't pose a serious threat. Again, how many times in history have we seen such situations where one group has such an overwhelming sense of superiority over another that they feel utterly justified in their desire to use force in an effort to secure what they want. Of course Caesar and Malcolm, who have developed a mutual respect and know that such conflict is completely unnecessary, are caught in the middle as war breaks out. The parallels to conflicts such as those in the Middle East are obvious and it is this distinct lack of subtlety that prevents the film from soaring as an engaging narrative. Reeves was obviously conscious of the need to appease an action-obsessed audience desperate for a fix of mayhem and chaos and such a focus prevents the film from offering any genuine insight into what is an utterly intriguing premise.There is still much to appreciate in what has been achieved on a technical and aesthetic level. The motion capture work is brilliant and, even if there are a few moments where some of the apes don't look quite real, the creation of the forest world and the apes who inhabit it is remarkable; certainly a far cry from Roddy McDowall in costume in the first Planet of the Apes in 1968. As Caesar, Andy Serkis is fabulous and it is great to see that he is duly credited as the star of the film. The casting of Clarke as Norman is a good choice because he doesn't bring any pre-conceived audience expectations or the baggage of previous roles that might burden a higher profile actor. Whilst Clarke is quietly effective as Norman, fellow Aussie Kodi Smit-McPhee has little to do as his son Alexander, while Keri Russell's Ellie is the convenient love interest with requisite medical training. Perhaps the biggest disappointment amongst the cast is seeing a talented actor like Oldman confined yet again to a one-dimensional role as a bombastic, narrow-minded douchebag. Whilst there are elements that impress, Dawn of the Planet of Apes possesses neither the intelligence nor the heart of its predecessor.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
332,larrymeers,The Best In The Trilogy,10,17 August 2017,"So after seeing War for the planet of the apes, i thought i would watch the last two to get a better look on how War fits into the perfect trilogy. And after revisiting Rise which was great, i saw this movie again and i personally think is not only the best in the trilogy, but one of the best sci-fi films this century has to date. Dawn of the planet of the apes takes place 10 years after the ape leader Caesar leads a revolt against the humans and frees his imprisoned apes. And in this one we see the apes create a civilization and things are going pretty well. Until a colony of humans are discovered and both groups struggle to maintain peace. First of all, this movie improves greatly over the 1st one with CGI and it looks amazing. We also see more characterization from Caesar and also some human characters. This movie also gave 2014 the best movie villain.... Koba. He was just great and he did things that were terrible but you also understood why he does what he does. The conflict between Caesar and Koba is just perfectly well done. We have a character that wants both groups to live side by side, and we have a character that just acts out of fear and vengeance. The plot is amazingly well done and there is not one dull moment (that i found anyways). The score is also epic. I better stop talking how great this movie is, sorry i do have a habit to talk a lot. If i was going to pick out one little flaw it would be that the human characters are not as interesting as the apes. I wasn't bored when the were on screen, i just found myself not as engaged as when Caesar, Koba, or any of the apes were on screen. But that is just a little flaw, it doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece. So in the end, Dawn of the planet of the apes is a masterpiece in every possible way. I loved it when i saw it in 2014, and it kinda grew on me as i watched it again. The action was amazing, the characters were well done, the score had me on edge, and the plot always had my attention. A+ or 10/10If i was gonna rank these movies it would go like this: 1. Dawn of the planet of the apes 2. War for the planet of the apes 3.

333,ssunny-social,Don of the Summer Movies,8,12 July 2014,"I was very eagerly waiting for this movie to come out after being spell bound by the last one. I am glad to say that this is even bigger and more beautiful. The movie starts with a brief introduction of the last movie so that even the first timers of the series won't have troubles over connecting the dots. This movie takes place ten years later from where the last left off. Most of the human race is wiped off in Simian Flu while the survivors have gathered in a colony, in efforts to reach out the others who are alive in any part of the world. Electricity is running out, there is very little resources left. In order to start with the power problem they go out in the dense forests with plans of restoring the long lying unused dam for hydro-electricity. This is also where the Apes have established their home, living as a family and being by each other's side in difficulties. It is then the clash begins and certain situational misunderstandings and betrayals take it to another level of twists and thrill. The director has done a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged by keeping the Apes enraged. The music seems very familiar and thus conventional. It's difficult to individualise it as a signature tone for any of the characters or even the movie. The acting has been top notch, particularly Andy Serkins who is now going to be known by this film among other fantastic characters that he has played. The cinematography looked enjoyable in few scenes like the time when the war begins with the tumbling horses ridden by the Apes and one other scene where an Ape called Koba rides a tank breaking the wall that served as human shield, though it is not picture perfect everywhere. But these technical flaws can easily be overlooked with the screenplay that balances emotions, drama, and action and thrills very well. It certainly leaves you with satisfaction and thus will serve as a great choice for the weekend.I am certainly looking forward for the third one (it has strong clues of return), to understand what new magic trick will the director now impress us after raising the bar so high.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
334,dareent-amethyst,Excellent story and special effects,8,13 July 2014,"Firstly, I hate fictional movies that involve animals or draculas or werewolves, basically anything that isn't human. But I was quite excited to see dawn of the planet of the apes because the first one was great, and although i thought it would be hard for the sequel to compete with the rise of the planet of the apes, it's safe to say it is just as good. Dawn of the planet of the apes tells the story of the special ape Caesar from the first movie who is now grown up and is the leader of the ape family, and his 'adventure' in helping humans get back on their feet after the epidemic of a deadly virus.  Dawn of the planet of the apes is a great movie with a great moral behind it. Honestly I was really angry when Koba killed Caesar and blamed it on the humans, it was totally unfair, but then i realized that it is fair to capture humans because what they had once done to the apes are worse than just putting them in a cage. This movie is an example of what goes around comes back around, but it can come back ten times worse. Not every humans are the same, they share similarities but that doesn't make them the same, and its not wrong to be a bad person, everyone has been bad, but it is not okay to turn our backs on each other. People are disgusted by animals but we can be worse than them at times. We put each other through hell all the time when we should have treated each other with respect and care cause we are family. I enjoyed the two hour movie all around. The storyline was okay, but my favorite aspect of this movie is the special effects. It's flawless. The movie was a little boring in the middle but it didn't bother me that much. Dawn of the planet of the apes is a great movie to watch with your family and friends. It is a movie about friendship, family, and trust. But not only the beautiful parts of it. I give it an 8/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Caesar who leads a community of apes has a wife and 2 children. A couple humans walk into Caesar's community and ask him if they can fix a dam that can help their community of survivors have electricity. This leads to a peace agreement between the apes and the humans.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Those are my top 3 sequels ever made. Andy Serkis as Caesar is amazing the academy needs to give him a Oscar nomination for this role. Or once he stops doing motion capturing the academy needs to give him an honor award for his career. The visual effects even look better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The visual effects also need a Oscar nomination. The acting is really good too also there are better characters. In Rise there seemed to be some characters that were just useless. Also the action scenes are just amazing and they are very intents. I was at the edge of my seat during those scenes. They don't reference that much from the old Planet of the Apes but some from Rise. The score in the film feels like from the 1968 version. The story is very interesting but it does feel slow at times but that doesn't bother me one bit. This movie just has some great moments. You get to see apes fight a bear and another ape riding a horse while shooting 2 machine guns. Overall this is probably one of the best movies that I've seen so far this summer. Also I can't wait for the sequel and Matt Reeves is returning to direct the next movie and I trust him. ""War has already begun.""-Caesar",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Within 10 minutes you are completely immersed in the story.One of the most fantastic aspects of this movie is that we watched it in 3-D and it didn't feel like that over-exaggerated 3-D effect that most 3-D movies give off these days. The 3-D effect was subtle enough that you didn't think about it but it added a great depth to the scenes, no pun intended.One of the greatest aspects of this movie is that it didn't rely simply on great CGI. The depth and allure is truly the acting and storyline. Andy Serkis (Caesar) is fantastic and Jason Clarke (Malcolm) really puts up a great performance.Clarke's portrayal of Malcolm is grand and he brings to life Malcolm in such a way that you feel like you've known him your entire life. Much of Malcolm's life prior to the virus outbreak isn't known or even brought up but the way in which Clarke portrays him allows your imagination to figure it out and that is a clincher. You really feel Malcolm's words and story in your soul.Andy Serkis' fantastic performance is yet another feather in the cap of this movie. As Clarke does with Malcolm, Serkis does in spades with Caesar's character. His movements are deliberate yet believable, he tells you more with his eyes and facial expressions during the movie than with his words. The manner in which Caesar and the other apes speak makes you believe that the next time you go to the zoo, you are going to be greeted by a speaking ape. At the same time it makes want to go on a spree across the country freeing all animals in scientific studies and in zoos.Toby Kebbell plays ""Koda"" to the limits of emotion. The proverbial ""emotion roller-coaster"" jumps the tracks on this one because you first empathize and sympathize with Koda, then you understand how and why he comes to hate humans. Once you start down that rabbit hole, you believe in his opinion that attacking the humans and killing them is the only way to defend the apes from them. The reality check is the way he gets the apes to follow him and that brings you back to a place in your soul where you now hate that fact that you ever felt sorrow for him, yet you hope he can redeem himself at some point.The rest of the supporting cast from Kodi Smit-McPhee as Alexander, the human boy to Nick Thurston as Blue Eyes to Keri Russell as Ellie are convincing in their roles. Karin Konoval plays Maurice the Orangutan with classical style. Maurice is immediately an ape that you can identify with and one that becomes a part of your heart from the first moment you see him.There is nothing bad in this movie. The directing, acting, CGI, etc are dead on and this movie owns a part of your soul when it ends.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
340,Victreebong,"Yeah, it's that good.",10,14 July 2014,"Forget Jurassic Park, District 9, Blade, and any other films that define a genre of Sci-Fi films. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes puts two ape @#$% crazy fists right down on all of them. Repeatedly.I cannot tell you what the cannon of the franchise has maintained from this movie, as I'm not that invested into the series. But what I can tell you is just how thoroughly fleshed out all the films characters have become since Dawn. While certain members may be missing, possibly due to the extinction caused by Simian Influenza, the big characters (Caeser, Maurice, Koba, Rocket) all return in due form. More vicious, more invested in survival, and more outraged with the possibility of human encroachment, every one of the apes has it's own vested interest in what ultimately turns into a gorilla civil war. Pun intended.Epic scenes, epic violence (they really pushed the PG-13 envelope), epic sounds, the harmonics of several hundred chimpanzees trumpeting in the middle of establishing shots, everything about this movie is epic. The struggle for all vested species is intense. Several stand-offs just have you saying to yourself, ""WTF is going to happen next!?"" The plot is simple, yet not easily executable. Encroach into another specie's territory at the risk of loosing all known resources, or face a war against each other? Cold war and civil war antics are only a matter of time. Koba is the new Judas.If you miss this is theatres this summer, man do I feel sorry for you. Go see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

343,theflixerdotcom,It's movie magic,9,29 October 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was definitely one of the stronger movies of the year. The story was strong, it wasn't predictable, and it didn't feel familiar. Lately, this is a rarity, and a refreshing one at that. I felt very satisfied at the end of the movie, but was hoping for more; to me that is the sign that I have watched a superior movie...Cesar and the apes are pure movie magic. It's amazing to think that the entire movie was based around CGI motion capture characters. They looked and behaved in such a realistic way that I forgot I was watching animations. Serkis has to take credit as well -- the man is a motion capture genius. He has completely immersed himself in this character which adds much to the believability of a thinking, talking chimp. Toby Kebbell wasn't far behind with his portrayal of Koba...I was shocked when I saw he played Koba...I think you may have found your calling Toby -- your performance here was by far the strongest I've seen from you.The only flaw with this movie is the human characters. I don't think they were bad, but Franco had such a strong performance in Rise, and his character was fleshed out so much more, that I just don't think this group was in his league. That's important because I didn't feel as if Serkis stole the show in the last movie, but I really think he did here. Because this movie had such an important role to play in the history of this universe, I would have hoped to care a little more about the people in it...but alas it wasn't to be.It's rare that a reboot/remake is so far superior as Dawn is to it's predecessors (minus Rise of the Planet of the Apes of course). This is probably one of the best, if not the best, reboot series ever. Many people were concerned when they said they were going to reboot the reboot a few years ago and look where we are now. I would venture to say that overall I enjoyed this a little more than Rise simply for the increase in scale and the spectacular special effects.This movie was a nice reminder of why I enjoy film and going to the theatre so much...so thank you for that.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

How much we are afraid, and especially of Xerox, the enemy smarter than his equal. Oh no i'm terribly sorry I made a huge mistake it is not his name, in fact he is called Caesar and it is true that for a monkey he looks less slob and less aggressive than these poor human beings described in this movie - actually filled with hatred and ready for anything to attack each day the others ones ! It is told here rather well, and it's absolutely true.Regrettably the suite of the movie does not hold the road and even if monkeys like to live naked, they make even less wild than in the original TV show, and they are especially less impressive. Disappointing enough altogether, we shall regret of a part of this which seems always a little to have been pumped off from another series, the famous ""Walking Dead""...My piece of advice: if you love apes do naturism, but above all buy yourself the whole DVD series products before Tim Burton instead of going to see this overrated and countless masterpiece of cinema.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
346,iamchrisallan,Such a huge disappointment,2,27 July 2014,"I have been a fan of Planet of the Apes since I was a kid in the 70s. I was instantly in love. I read the books of the films when I could get them (you couldn't just pick up a movie back then. There was no video available). I avidly watched the TV show and I bought merchandise. I was besotted and have remained so. Maybe this has something to do with why nothing since has quite come close.Let's get the good stuff out of the way. The animation /CGI of the apes is phenomenal. They look real. The idea that humans had almost been annihilated by a deadly flu is a great plot device and better than the reason given in the original films (a plague killed cats and dogs so we brought apes in to replace them as pets and then to be servants). That's it. After that it's all down hill.The story is riddled with holes and left me asking why, why, why throughout the film and long after it had ended. Forgive me but I have to get them off my chest.This is 10 years since Rise and no humans have been seen for 2 years but there is a huge city just over the bridge. It's so close you can see it when the generator turns on the power and the lights come on. Hang on, they already had power anyway so the lights would already have been visible.The humans come to find the dam because they only have 2 weeks power left. Hey, great forward planning people.The man they bring who is the only person who knows about water power is a dick, such a badly drawn character but they need him. Then they dump him and get the power station working. Err how? Why do apes hunt stag? Why do they kill a bear after the way they have been treated? Don't they appreciate letting wild animals live in the wild? Why do the apes ride horses? Are these the naturally wild horses normally found in forests? Why does Caesar's son, Blue Eyes, side with Kobo the bonobo? When Kobo and his mates get the guns they have no problem in loading them and shooting them. Kobo is such a good shot he hits Caesar easily.When Blue Eye's goes to Caesar's house they all speak to him in English. When did he learn this? Caesar plops out the odd word now and again but surely he normally talks ape talk and sign language.After 10 years the camcorder still has battery life and works. It wasn't looted or smashed.Gary Oldman's character has no motivation for wanting a war.The humans have a ""Tower"" that strangely seems to be all scaffolding. Ideal if you're a bunch of monkeys and want a fight.Oldman set C4 around the tower - just above his own head. Erm that might just kill you when you detonate it. It did but it didn't kill our boring human hero who was standing there at the time.Caesar's other half, Cornelia, is very ill and needs antibiotics. She gets them and feels as right as rain by the end of the same day.Caesar after being shot is really weak from blood loss. Never mind. Give him 2 days and he will fight like he's on meth against Kobo Bonobo.There was more. So much more.On top of that it's too dark and too long.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
347,karagoraymond,A movie that made people go Ape Sh*t !,8,18 March 2015,"Quite possibly the greatest sequel, period. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is without doubt, the best film of the entire franchise. Just like the last film, the best thing about the movie is Caesar, played brilliantly by the always fantastic Andy Serkis, who has turned the genre of motion capture acting into an art form. Caesar goes from being a revolutionary into being a leader, Serkis' commanding presence transcends into Caesar's command over the apes. I also a huge fan of the ending, when Caesar is pushed to break his own law by murdering the villain, Koba. I always find it compelling when heroes or leaders are forced to break the morals in order for the greater good such as Superman in Man Of Steel. Koba is also shown to be compassionate and caring, such as allowing the humans to work on their electricity, all in an attempt for peace, showing Caesar to be much more than a one dimensional lead.Another great quality in the film is Koba, the villain. One thing I must say, is though he was a vicious antagonist, I actually ended up feeling sorry for him. From the first film one could see that he had been a victim of long term suffering as a result of being tested and his hatred for human beings is coming from. Apart from that, he is a completely awesome villain. When he murders the two guards (after putting on the cute monkey act) was terrifying for two reasons, one it was terrifying and two it completely contrasted our cuddly perception of apes with the reality of how fierce and powerful they really are, it reminded me of the orangutan that murders a woman and hides her body in a chimney in the novel The Murders of Rue Morgue by Edgar Allen Poe. Koba also represents the side effect that if animals were to gain the intelligence of humans then as long as the positive qualities like ambition or desire for freedom (as shown by Caesar in ""Rise"") they would also inherit the negative aspects such as hatred, bittrernes and prejudice. I also love the dramatic irony that in the mission to eradicate humans, the thing he hates most, Koba almost becomes more human (by showing negative human qualities).The human characters were also likable, but it must be said that the biggest surprise was Garry Oldman. In all the trailers, he was made out to be the villain, but in the end he turned out to be one of the most sympathetic characters. The man had to balance the pain of losing his family along with leading the few human survivors. I honestly felt sympathetic when he blew up the tower, and I probably would have done the same thing in that situation. Malcolm and his family were also likable as they were able to be good without being one dimensional, as they had all experienced pain as a result of the disease and were all trying to avoid feeling such pain themselves.The best part about the film was the story. What I loved was that it was not actually humanity's fault that the two species went to war but in fact it was the fault of the apes, as it was an ape (Koba) that started the war, showing that, if given the intelligence, animals could have the same potential to be cruel and evil as humans.This has been one of the best reviews to write about the best film (so far) of 2014. Dawn of The Planet of the Apes is a must see.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
348,timothy-pinzone,Dawn of Planet of Suspense,10,2 February 2015,As the final credits began to roll I realized how captivated I was from possibly one of my favorite films of all time. Suspenseful at nearly every turn and a very unpredictable plot that looks like its going one way but makes a miraculous turn of events that creates a truly enthralling ride. From apes on horses to motion capture at it's absolute best. Gary Oldman is excellent as usual with an absolutely phenomenal motion capture performance from not just Andy Serkis but from literally everyone.The only issue is that there is not enough James Franco but that's an issue that can be sidestepped for now as this film sets up what looks to be a thrilling climax to what has been a fantastic series so far what's best is I still don't know the path the sequel will take but from the ending that left me stargazed to the end of the end credits I can just about be sure.Rating: A+ Comment: Every world leader needs to watch this film to teach them what true leadership is about.,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
349,buny101,don't understand all the hype,6,14 July 2014,"It was okay for a movie. The special effects were pretty good, and for that reason alone it was worth seeing. But the story? The direction? Please...lots of plot holes that the the general public have to swallow. For example...the apes live in Muir Woods (from what I can gather--it's only 12 miles from SF and close enough for them to interact...if they lived in the main part of Redwoods, it would be a 300 mile journey back to town, and stretches the belief that the monkeys could follow humans back for such a distance or interact at all, but would be a better place for the monkeys to actually live). It's just not that big. It's only 564 acres. I used to be a farmhand in Kansas, and can tell you that one square mile is 640 acres. So, all these apes are living in this paradise? On less than one square mile of woods? There are enough resources to support their colony? I don't think so. And the story of the need of the dam. I can't find any dam inside Muir woods, but if I am mistaken, so be it. But, San Francisco has other dams...one of them 25 miles away. If the apes live with this dam, you don't have to go back to it. It's not like it's the only dam in the world. Even if the other dam is more easily repaired, it is in the middle of a war zone. Go to the dam that is 25 miles away and be monkey free. That would be the smart thing. The monkeys designate a meeting spot by drawing an obscure symbol on a window. You realize, suddenly, that the drawing matches a window someplace in the city. The fact that the it must be the only window like it in the whole darn city of San Francisco, and every monkey knows exactly where that window is, why, that is nothing short of a miracle. Or the fact that a monkey picks up a camcorder and it has enough power to play the tape left in it from 10 years earlier. Or, why do they follow Caesar anyways? The movie makes a great pitch that they follow strength. OK...I would have accepted they follow Caesar because he freed them. But, if they follow strength, then why didn't a gorilla take over already? As strong as Caesar and the rest of the chimps are, they are nothing in strength compared to one silverback gorilla. This is like comparing King Kong to Bobo the Chimp. If they don't follow strength, then they follow Caesar...but then there is not plot issues later...so for convenience...well, there you go....another plot hole that is glazed over. These plot contrivances of necessity take away from the story because every time these wonderful little miracles happen to advance the plot, you sit back and go...""Wait one sec..."" or at least, I do. So...special effects? Yeah...pretty good. Story? Um...lots of holes. Character development? The humans are pitiful and underwritten. The main character is doing this for his son, because his son has seen so much tragedy, and he wants to build a better place for his children (exactly the same reason that Caesar is doing this for the apes). Well, Mr. Main Character, every human left alive, of which there are only a handful, has seen exactly what your precious child has seen, too. Also, out of city the size of San Francisco, two survivors who were immune to the simian flu are father/son? Another plot contrivance? I think so...wow...it just goes on and on. People are raving about this movie. I don't get it. The story is just not there. What little story that is there is propped up by more miracles than the Matthew, Mark, Luke or John could have found. If it weren't for these miracles, there would be no story. None. The fact that most of the public, and even the critics are going crazy over this is proof that there is such a dearth of original ideas and good movies out of Hollywood that even something this poorly done is head and shoulders above the rest of the stuff that they are churning out. That doesn't make this good. It just shows how abysmal the rest of the crap really is. Plot holes are just like pot holes...if you don't fill them in, you end up with a bumpy ride that no one enjoys. They didn't fill them in, but just pretended they don't exist. Everyone thinks that this movie is steak, and the rest of the movies are hot dogs. Bad news, folks. This isn't steak. It's just hamburger served on a plate with a baked potato. Not that great. Better than everything else, maybe...but not that great.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
350,xylophone59,Thoroughly made and convincing,8,9 July 2014,"First time ever I have been alone in a cinema. It was the 3D version. It was playing simultaneously in the same Philippine mall in the non 3D version which had cheaper tickets. I was never into the planet of the apes movies since I saw an early one with Charlton Heston in it I think. This 2014 was a heck of a lot better for a number of reasons. I have no complaints since it was a thorough hardworking film and it was certainly not a rip off. It does give value for money, especially if you buy into the premise. It is quite convincing and has a good sense of drama and depth. What The Weight by the Band was doing on the soundtrack beats me. I love the song and always have. It just seemed incongruous in the context of the movie. Yes the special effects were good and many scenes were interesting if invariably dark hued. But here is the thing for me: I just wasn't that interested in what happened to the characters of either species. That may not be the film's fault but it is how I felt. There were no holes in it that I could see and as I said it managed to be convincing. However I just could not get into it. It started a bit slowly and that's fine, but it never actually grabbed me or compelled me to be enthralled. I am not blaming the movie though, so maybe I just wasn't in the mood. Still do go and see it if you are into post apocalypse set pieces or science fiction. Perhaps through not fault of its own it just wasn't to my taste. A good movie, to be fair to all the hardworking people who did a very thorough job.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
351,karen-821-938620,"Apes on horseback, what's not to like? Well...",5,8 August 2017,"This is a visually compelling movie which attempts to illustrate how much easier it is to start a war than keep a peace. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by a bright 5th grader with no idea of how anything works. Every scene has a couple logical or continuity problems which are annoying if you know anything about power grids, power plants, tunnels and explosives, antibiotics, the climate of California, the distribution of power plants in California or the flora and fauna of Muir Woods. The only thing to eat there for apes would be banana slugs, and not once do they show the inside of one of those sequoias, which is just a shame. Ironically, the film makers have decided not to give the apes clothes, making them into Ken dolls instead, but even an ape is going to want a jacket in Muir woods on a rainy day. No primate, human or otherwise, is going to stay in that part of the bay area without ocean trade. Of course, San Jose wouldn't look very compelling covered with ivy and poison oak, but at least it has arable land and the sun shines. However, many of the negative reviews forget that in this series the intelligence of the apes is not evolutionary, but comes from the deus ex machina of a magic virus that makes you smart, but then kills you if you are human, but not if you are an ape. For this film, this is logical consistency.More annoying are the uncharacteristic things done by people and apes just to move the plot forward and create formulaic dramatic situations. We know so much about ape psychology that the idea that more than a dozen chimps could live together peaceably is nonsense. ""Ape no kill other ape""? Not likely. Also, if you met a talking ape, wouldn't you try to talk to it? And not once does anyone point out that humans are apes. At least the intellectual is still an orangutan. Gary Oldmans character is better drawn than the reviews would make you think and there are a couple cute scenes, but mostly you have to suppress the thought, ""Why are they doing that?"".",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
352,WhiteFire404,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Review,8,22 August 2017,"After the ending of the first film, I was hoping they would make a sequel so that we could see where the story would go next, luckily in 2014 we got exactly that, and it didn't disappoint. When I heard that Wyatt was retiring as a director in this franchise, I got a bit nervous because whenever you change directors within a franchise, I can either work really well or really bad, but then I heard that they hired Matt Reeves to direct the sequel, the same man who directed Cloverfield and Let Me In, that gave me a bit more confidence in the sequel. Matt Reeves did one heck of a job directing this movie, is stunning, the cinematography is just beautiful. Andy Serkis is once again great as Caesar and Toby Kebbell was also fantastic as Koba, once again the human characters played by Jason Clarke and Keri Russell, while giving good performances, the writing of their characters never made them as interesting as the apes, but that is also because the people playing the apes are that good. I really like the story and how is executed, a lot of things you'd think would be predictable in a movie like this, are done in ways you wouldn't expect. I really think Dawn is up there with T2 and The Dark Knight as one of those few sequels that don't just live up to it's predecessor, it excels it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
353,adamray101,Anti-gun PSA with a pinch of Jurassic Park nostalgia,7,12 July 2014,"Well I enjoyed every bit of it. It was very, very long. I really felt that it was sort of like a director's cut more than anything else.What really made it great was that it followed Ceasar and his ape tribe. It also really took a short view of the humans and the virus that plagued the world. It stuck to it's story and made us believe that these apes were creatures that have feelings, family, and overall an emotional brotherhood connection. AND it gave you the spook factor of living in a ""lost world"" and gave you that tense grab of the unknown.One thing I felt they pushed was the fact that guns were a major plot wrench that fell into the gears and messed up this almost peaceful utopia between humans and apes to live as one. But what it did do is set up this series for about ten more sequels and allow you to branch out into different parts of the new Planet Apes world.For those that liked the first reboot Apes movie, you're going to have a better time with this one.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

356,ShaShank_MovieFreak,"""This ape is like nothing you've ever seen.""",8,14 July 2014,"In 2011, Rise of the planet of Apes has revived the Planet of the Apes franchise successfully, and it garnered commercial and critical acclaim. Rightly so. Building up on a predecessor that nailed so many aspects just right is definitely a daunting task. And despite a few shortcomings, Dawn was able to actually pull that off in style.Dawn is a perfect blockbuster, with enough amounts of emotion, intelligent writing and action making it one of the few films that do so very rarely. The last movie that gave me such impression - a sensible blockbuster - was The Dark Knight Returns.The story picks up after its prequel, leaving a few details cleverly dropped and for the viewer's imagination. Our super-intelligent ape Caeser, who made it home at the climax of Rise will mature much over the time and is the leader of the 'Tribe' of monkeys in the wild. Of course, the human survivor territory and the Ape territory are effectively separated, the humans staying in the amazingly realized New York City devastated after the outbreak in Rise and the monkeys stay in the wild, among the high trees, inhabiting them. The survivors come up with a plan to revive and old dam for the sake of electricity since their stored up fuel is getting exhausted. The plan is good enough, except for the fact that the dam falls into the Ape territory. What happens after that forms the rest of the story. I shall not analyze the story here as it requires a lot of spoiling to the people who have not seen the movie. There are a few clichéd moments that form the main conflict and it gets predictable towards the end. Except for that, the story never bores you. It's really good and there will be enough plot twists to keep the interest high up. The screenplay leaves you with enough back story to characters on each side that you will find that its hard not to root for a particular side - humans or Apes. It also tidies up the premise for a wait-worthy sequel.A story so good needs a top-notch cast to support it and carry it. On the human-side, there is Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell among others and they all do a commendable job. A good soundtrack and great cinematography among many other departments make the Ruined New York extremely believable and immersive. The 3D was particularly effective in the latter part of the experience.Now for the real deal. The Ape side. In Rise, Caeser's motion capture actor Andy Serkis has done a fabulous job and the motion capture was equally well done. But Dawn builds up on the already spectacular performance and as a result, the performances of all the Apes, specifically the main characters and more importantly Caeser, were jaw dropping. With this movie, Andy Serkis has proved that he is positively one of the best motion capture artists out there. Every detail, every frown, every sneer, every smile and every muscle movement was wonderfully captured with a ridiculous amount of authenticity. It is extremely hard, not to be impressed by Caeser's character as well. On one hand, he is the leader of the Apes and on the other, he has seen the loving side of the humans. His attempts for peace, his decisions and his ties to his own family (oops!) definitely remind us of a few great leaders of history.There are only a few complaints I have about this movie and everything else is so good these complaints might look like knit-picks. Some of the characters in the story were unnecessary and the love angle between two characters though welcome, did feel a bit out of the place. The story eventually gets predictable but by then there will be virtually no main scene left to guess. The pacing slightly drops before the second act and picks up very soon. And that's all I've got.If you were allowed only one movie this whole summer, this is the one I'd pick. Dawn is a sci-fi blockbuster so well made that only a few movies reach its level of storytelling and intrigue. If the visuals don't impress you, the soundtrack doesn't elevate the mood and if the cast doesn't pique your interest, then the character of Caesar should do the trick. He is like nothing you've ever seen. That ape is a show-stopper and I'm running out of adjectives here.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

If you are going to see one film this year this is a must . Kids and adults loved it . They had a huge budget of 150 million and I can see they used every cent on the film . Couldn't be a better cast and it was fun to watch a remake I use to think was so bizarre. Use to watch the original film as funny to laugh at a long with the killer tomatoes. This film remake was nothing like the original film . 10 for everything on this film . graphics . storyline (because you fell in love with the charters ) 10 for directing .

Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for his performance which was just seamless...seriously it is amazing how they pulled this off...the Ape village, the relationship between the apes and there families all perfectly believable. the story is not what i would have expected in relation to how the war would actually begins...i thought they would go in a more clichéd road but they surprised me in a very good way...in the end the movie has less to do with us humans as it actually has to do with Cesar's relationship with the other apes, and his belief on how different and noble the Apes are as compared to humans...unfortunately for him, it turns out we are not so different after all. this is a must watch...action.. top notch, CGI..top notch, story...top notch, and Apes on horses!!...what else can we ask for?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
359,daviddevilliers54,Stunning!!! Best post-apocalypse film so far!!! Apes finally (Well sort of) dominate the planet which leads to the new and great World War III - Can't wait for the sequel!,10,26 October 2014,"I've been waiting for the sequel since the first film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, came out which was in 2011. When it was the 11 July 2014, I was more excited than ever when I went to the theaters. It's a great story. I loved Toby Kebell's character as Koba. I felt Koba's tragic feelings and I actually felt sorry for him when Caesar let him fall to his death (Or major injury). Caeser's character was good too. I know what it is like to rather make peace instead of war but it always happens. I thought this was the best apocalypse movie ever made in this year so far. I have always loved Planet of the Apes because apes are the second most intelligent beings on earth and one day if they could evolve further enough, the could dominate the planet. I am hoping to see a sequel!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
360,Kevbo1985,Almost Great...,8,2 August 2014,"But still very good all the same, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a film that does an excellent job at continuing the rebooted tale without jumping over too many plot points. It lacks in pure acting ability, but that is strictly reserved for the poorly cast human characters. The apes are portrayed, acted and integrated into the world with seamless precision, allowing for the needed suspension of disbelief.The story is quite familiar, but also refreshing, a turn of events that the first film in the rebooted franchise doesn't foreshadow. With humanity seemingly at a moment of extreme crisis the world over, Caesar, the original ape who developed increased intelligence and who became the leader of his kind, has led his people into the thick forests of California to establish a home. The entire film centers around the interaction between a small colony of humans and Caesar's tribal apes.It all progress with fantastic tempo, the pacing only surpassed by the anticipation it builds in the viewer. ""What's going to happen?"" is a question many movies attempt to have the viewer ask themselves, but only the minority actually succeed at. This film is in that excellent minority.The only flaws, to my eyes, were as I said: the humans. Gary Oldman, despite being casted in a type of role I've always felt he was suited for, is underutilized in comparison to certain other people. These others, a mixed bag of performances, are mostly overshadowed and at times insignificant to the apes themselves. Perhaps this was inevitable when considering the story, but I do feel that more could have been done to provide a more balanced and engaging human colony in terms of casting and performance.In the end, I got my money's worth and then some, with only the smallest complaint to offer. Now, my opinion may be more favorable to the reboot as I am one of those who have never seen the originals (shocking, I know), but I can't imagine this film or the last doing any disservice to the classics of the past. Worth the price of admission, and shines well above your average summer blockbuster fare.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

362,NurgleTheUnclean,"Heavy handed ideology, with massive technical flaws.",3,3 November 2014,"While the plot is interesting enough to stay awake through, this move has so many glaring technical flaws it became simply ridiculous. The CGI while very detailed, fluid and spectacular, is also glaringly unnatural, and distracting.The human mission is also very technically flawed. With enormous systems which would require constant supervision and maintenance are simply treated like a light switch to be flipped on and never need to revisited. Lame dialog ""this relay is bad go get another one."" to some kid who grew up in an apocalyptic wasteland, who would have no idea what a relay was not to mention the specific type of relay, as well as they are in a dilapidated facility with what appears to be no maintenance parts or anything else to conduct repairs with.While I get that the apes are advanced and not to be confused with real wild apes, I can give some leniency for sci-fi. But they are apes, not aliens, I am reasonably familiar with apes and their limitations especially from what has been demonstrated in the previous movies. They overreach their technical as well as physical ability, very quickly. The basic parallels between the mentality of the humans and apes is reasonably clever and thoughtful but a bit slow and near the end down right heavy handed.Here's the spoiler. Once the apes capture many guns from the humans the movie goes down hill fast. The apes who have no familiarity with guns other than being shot by them, are now able to fire 2 assault rifles simultaneously in each hand while on horseback in a full gallop and actually hit targets other than than themselves or the horses the're riding on?!?! The complexity of loading a magazine with the correct ammunition, then chambering, switching the safety, aiming, trigger control, loud sound tolerance, etc, is completely dismissed. This is why soldiers basic training with a rifle is 8 weeks long (granted not all 8 weeks are rifle training) and the rifle is anatomically designed to be fired by a human not an ape. But you get the point, an ape no matter how smart wouldn't be able to simply pick up a rifle and do much more with it than use it as a club.I've seen worse for sure, but this movie is highly overrated, if you are sensitive to technical flaws like I am this movie will frustrate more than entertain.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
363,tsakiridis1217,A Breathtaking Visual,10,1 April 2015,"To make a film full of apes running around is simple. To make it interesting; well, that's a challenge. To make it compelling and stunning and top-quality; well, that's worth recognizing.Where ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" left us to pick up is an inhospitable earth, where almost every human has been whipped out from the deadly virus. What's left is a small habitant where leftovers of resources keep the last survivors alive. During that time, not very far away in the woods, we get to know the encampment of the apes. Time is spent on understanding the culture, feelings and order within their world. Ceasar, the leader is presented as a appreciable human-thinking ape: with morals and fairness... apparently things he learned from his human mentor-father.But Ceasar seems the only one to believe in humans. His struggles of passing along his wisdom is mostly failing. The main reason happens to be the fact that the other apes do not share experiences of happiness, joy and love from the humans. They mostly remember the torture and humiliation the humans put them through. And when the time comes for them to actually encounter, a superior ape named Koba will find a way to turn their will against them. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" benefits from your low expectations. Sure, the previous 1st installment was decent, but how much can you really wait for in this type of film? Still, creating a dark and realistic world was surprisingly fun and sensible. What also counts as an achievement is the convenient and without-realizing-it way you find yourself feeling for the apes as much as the humans. And what a guilty pleasure was it to stare and follow Andy Serkis as Ceasar (wrongdoing his absence from Oscars, personal opinion, although understandable reason that he had CGI help).The way the family relationships of apes are developed is excellently put. And all situations involving them are portrayed with honesty and common sense. In simple words, the director does well by not thinking ""let's make it cool"" all the time but prefers to ask himself ""how would it happen if it would be real?"". That results in our advantage: the silly and campy funniness from the previous generations movies of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies is gone. The franchise suffered enough from deadly hilarious and wacky pictures. Forget all that; this is serious film-making and definitely worth-viewing.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
364,adammcadam,could have been so much more,4,23 April 2015,"Maybe contains very minor spoiler personally I feel like these films are such a shame because really the concept of a cross over period between a virus wiping out humans and apes taking over as the dominant species on earth could have made such a great film in my opinion. But everything is really unrealistic and badly done in my opinion. from the idea that there is some magical chemical which can give apes human-like intelligence (even though their brains are 3x smaller than ours, they are missing important intelligence genes and brain areas etc), to the idea that an apes vocal cords could allow it to speak in English just like a human but in a slightly gruff voice, to the unrealistic CGI, the way these apes behave, move etc and are able to use things with human like dexterity. The apes are basically just coming across as slightly more dumb/savage humans in suits cognitively, and unrealistic CGI things in how they move. And It is really such a shame. The film basically makes no sense when it could instead have been a sci-fi film which was plausible and reailstic. The film is similarly full of silly unrealistic scenarios like.. why didn't the guys in the tank have the hatch closed as opposed to driving into a pile of apes and allowing them to all go inside the tank and kill the tank crew... really any reason to drive into a huge pile of apes in a tank with the hatch open instead of closing it? In my opinion what should have happened in these films is the virus should have wiped out the majority of humanity and maybe affected surviving humans cognitively in some way, causing surviving humans to regress a bit and go back to a hunter gatherer lifestyle, go forwards a few million years and now some apes have evolved more intelligence and are the dominant species and are enslaving humans. Make the apes distinctly different to humans, give them weapons and technology, homes etc befitting apes not humans, bear in mind their own natural habitats, their physicality (e.g. less dexterity and control over strength, an ape probably would find it very difficult to pull a gun trigger well etc let alone aim one, an ape still wouldn't be able to make the same noises as humans but have their own language etc) make them distinctly different from humans not just coming across as slightly more savage and primitive humans.The films could have been good and interesting sci-fi, but ended up being too unbelievable, unrealistic and too much bad CGI in my opinion. Also no decent character development or storyline really or anything. Basically the story is a group of humans and a group of apes end up fighting and thats it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
365,readjacksonporter,Dawn of a New Kind of Filmmaking,9,12 July 2014,"I've long been awaiting this sequel to 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which means my expectations have been building for three years. To say the least, I had very high expectations. I was weary going in to this film. The change in director, cast and tone made me nervous. Reeves and the writers were asking us to follow Caesar, our favorite ape, which isn't hard to do, but not writing in familiar human characters was a risky move. This sequel almost doesn't feel like a sequel, it almost feels like a reboot. The first 15 minutes of the film is entirely about the apes. You do not see a single human in the first 15 or so minutes. This was a brilliant move. It introduced us into this entirely new world, one we weren't yet familiar yet. We meet, yet again, Caesar, who is now the leader of 300 or so apes, married to a sick, pregnant ape; and father to his confused, reckless and emotional son Blue Eyes. Then there's his loyal followers, his right hand men, and those who follow because he is the strongest ape. And then we are introduced to the movie's main villain: Koba. A multi-dimensional, hate- filled, anger driven villain who's resentment towards humans eventually leads him to his defeat. Koba truly does love his kind. He wants them to be safe. And that's his original motive in fighting the humans. But his motive shifts later in the film when his narcissism and inferiority are fueled by Caesar's disagreement, driving him into a blinding anger and irresistible thirst for being in control. Shortly afterwards, we are introduced to our main human cast. There's Dreyfus, leader/dictator of the small band of humans, who's role is big but screen time is small. Told simply through emotion and no words, the past 10 years have ended in nothing but tragedy for this man. The implied death of his family inspires Dreyfus to lead and protect his people, and eventually forces him, in the end, to topple the tower and inform the military of the ape's existence. Carver is the first human to appear on screen. The shot he fires that injures Ash is arguably the beginning of the war. In my opinion, if Koba and Carver's characters had never existed, peace would have been achievable (at least temporarily), but their constant disobedience, unreliability and dishonesty were the largest catalysts in the inevitable war between ape and man. It doesn't take long for Malcolm to establish himself as our main man. Jason Clarke performs the role perfectly and delivers a character strong enough to carry the film through it's entire 130 minutes. Just like its predecessor, do not go into the theater expecting an action film. It is not. It's a sci-fi, a drama. Moments where a director would throw in action, Reeves instead hands us a thought-provoking, character-improving scenes that make this film as great as it is. I don't want to give too much away, but the film isn't about war, the film is about loss and survival and hope and the difficulty in maintaining peace. It's about how we, as humans, need someone to blame for our losses. We strive for revenge though it is and always will be our destruction. The CGI in this film was better than it was in Rise. I felt as if what I was seeing on screen actually was real. The sound mixing was superb. And the entire film itself is what I'd like to call a masterpiece. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will not only revolutionize motion-capture CGI in films, but hopefully it will inspire other writers and directors to realize that there is a balance between action and character development. That, when working together, they can produce something magnificent. Just as Caesar believed would happen if humans and apes had only been willing to sort out their differences.

Not only was this movie too long, but it bored me, and I was more confused than before.*** spoilers *** I was hoping for a resolution or at least some hint at whatever happened to the astronauts launched into space in PotA I, but nothing here on that track. The original PotA(1968) starts off with astronauts landing on some unknown (to them at the time) planet; however, thus far we've gotten no suspense as to what they'll encounter when (and if) they land somewhere in this re-boot. We get a back-story from part I as to how humans became dumb and apes smart; in part II we get... exactly what I have no idea.Apes living in what appears to be a village, having no contact with humans. Humans live in some run-down city (San Fran), are running out of fuel, they need to re-start the dam to get electric power going. Ifcourse, the dam just happens to be within ape territory. Shenanigans and all sorts of shoot 'em ups ensue.Now, yes, the CGI and ape movements are much more realistc than in PotA '68, and perhaps even in 2001 '68. But, we again get ape vs. humans fight scenes, an evil doer who challenges his leader, etc.I am beginning to think that the PotA reboot of 2001 made more sense, for those who cared to think about the cause-effect time-lines loop. At least it did have a time traveling astronaut who was confused as to where he was and what was going on.Since other humans were contacted, is a bigger army of humans supposed to come to the rescue? I sure hope PotA III will address these questions.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Some of the cooler things about the show is that you get to see the apes talk a LOT more which is awesome since Ceaser has such a cool voice, another thing is that it explains how the apes even had a chance to overthrow the humans because in reality if all the apes in the world went against humans they would be wiped out by any one army like nothing else. this movie explains that the humans were killed off by the virus and there are only a handful of humans left which give the apes a much greater chance of survival. so in all i would suggest seeing this film it was a great remake of the long loved classic and it was a fun movie to watch.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
373,pg-tsinc,Average but boring,5,13 July 2014,"Average film, with decent efforts, but boring after about 15 min. (don't tell me you didn't look at your watch ?). The weakness is in the scenario. According to the previews, 95% of the humanity was dead. I had in mind that the apes were already dominating the whole earth, the few remaining humans were crawling to get medicine. The war was already won by apes (able to master technology) and a few strong humans (mostly in USA of course) were offering some challenge and fighting back. I would have prefer they start from there, then it would have been fascinating & entertaining to watch, but NO (maybe $ problems, or they keep that for the 3rd film which I will miss), we had to go through the whole process... Predictable in general, and boring. I thought they were going to exploit the ''hundredth monkey effect'', new communications skills... It's a bit like watching a Napoleonic battle, but before, having to endure the stars perform a fake love scene & tender kisses for 45 minutes... c'Mon, if you want an interlude here's a free suggestion: After the deer & bear hunt in the jungle, why not a BBQ at the MUMBA BAR, with the sexy Miley she-monkeys doing the rope dance ? OK Two more 'serious' points. Keir O'Donnell (the bad guy in Mail Cop) his underused in this film, with a small part. I would have give him the part of Carver (the ape-phobic), he's got the acting skills & a mad look perfect for that. Finally, concerning the frustration of Peter Wilder about the fight between a bear and a chimp (pretending that a bear would always win). Just think twice. A female 135 pounds chimp (Suzette, quite cute) checked in with a 1-hand pull of 1,260 pounds on a dynamo meter at the Bronx Zoo. We are talking here about an animal who has almost no idea of what's going on about this test, an animal who was living in a zoo since her birth. Do you know that the strongest men they found could do only about 200 pounds ? And he did it after repeated and focus effort. Can you imagine how much Suzette could lift with 2 arms ? Do you realize the strength ? When Suzette was not in a good mood, she could easily broke reinforced doors with her feet blows. An Orangutan was able to throw a big wood trunk in the air with one arm (about a ton according to the zoo keepers evaluation because 6 men were unable to move it even a small little bit). So a powerful male chimp, hunting in the wild with the intelligence of Einstein, armed with a spear could possibly kill a bear don't you think ? Big bears have problems with another small animal: a wolverine weights between 20-55 pounds (1/2 a dog) and can kill an adult grizzly, just look for ''wolverine vs bear'' ytube, you will see that this little devil can also destroy a pack of wolves...alone",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
374,magnusmax,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: A Glorious Sequel,9,20 November 2017,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of my all-time favourite films. Here is why: It is heavily emotive, powerful, and dark - a worthy sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes, featuring a fine cast, superb visual effects, and a laudable score from Michael Giachinno (The Incredibles, Spiderman: Homecoming) bound together in the tale of a well-woven series of tragic misunderstandings that lead ultimately to the bloody outcome of total war (quite literally). Firstly, I'd like to comment on the plot. The beauty of the conflict between man and ape seems to be contained in the fact that neither side is truly evil, and that neither side desires war, but rather peace. Paralleling reality, war - that inevitable and inescapable fate which, by the means of often indirect and convoluted paths looms incessantly closer despite everyone's best intentions - draws men, women and children inside of it in a living tornado of human lives. Some have accused the franchise of a predictable and typical story; but consider that most of the audience is already familiar with how this story ends, making the movies more character- centered as a result. The real conundrum is not so much which race gains control of the planet, but rather where Caesar is driven morally (a theme further developed in War). As in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, we are not concerning ourselves with whether the new Death Star survives the rebels' attack, so much as we are concerning ourselves with the fate of our characters - will Kylo Ren accept Han Solo's invitation to renounce evil and return home? The plot is relatively simple, yet soulful and meaningful.As a means of countering repetition of my previous review on Rise, I shall tend to be brief on matters I've already addressed. Our new ensemble of actors is refreshing, and lends the movie a new context. Enough recognizable faces reprise their roles as familiar characters such as Caesar, Maurice, Koba and Rocket; yet, we are treated to a whole, fresh crew including Gary Oldman's Dreyfus, Jason Clarke's Malcolm, Keri Russell's Ellie and Kodi Smit-Mcphee's Alexander. Though our new human protagonists are comparable to our previous ones, they differ so much as to add something quite new to the trilogy. The movie maintains fine general character continuity, and they fit nicely into the synopsis, without becoming too centrepiece, which I admire. Dreyfus especially provides abundant material for thought. He is a villain wrought by misunderstanding and circumstance - not entirely culpable for his actions, which, owing to his ignorance, he sees as the only logical path to take. He was originally a family man, not a war general or governor of thousands. Again, misunderstandings pave the way for ruin. Perhaps my only criticism here would be Alexander's lack of pertinence to the overall story. He was intriguing, yet in retrospect, feels unexplored. In the face of the sequel, seemingly his and his family's history was cut tragically short, leaving little room for imagination to conjure a future for him.Visual effects have improved notably since Rise, and Matt Reeve's recent comment on them is worthy of note. To paraphrase, he pointed out that Weta is often straining itself to reach new heights as movies are made. If a particular texture or metaphysical reaction is required for a movie such as this one, hitherto unaccomplished feats are then nominated order of the day. Thus capabilities are stretched and extended with each new production. An understanding of this can perhaps aid viewers in assessing the state and stage of progression we are in - as always, we are constantly making rapid advancements in technological areas. Another noteworthy item is the amount of work involved in creating these visual effects. For instance, one of Dawn's most complicated visual effects-heavy shots was rendered a total of 1200+ times, and completed only a couple of weeks before the movie opened in cinemas. Meanwhile, Giachinno's score meshed well with the tone of the movie - dark, deep, powerful (though minimal), tribal and occasionally rather mischievous.Finally, I want to give a word on Matt Reeves' expert directorship on this film and in general. The biggest reason the Apes trilogy resonates so effectively with its enthusiasts is the priority Reeves gives to the emotional connection the audience shares with the main protagonist (i.e. Caesar). He likes often to talk of this intimacy, and of the internal emotional and moral struggles that occur inside Caesar (and hopefully Batman, given a few years down the track). A second thing - Reeves directs movies not like a business, but like a passion. He isn't afraid to experiment, and seems to really care about the story he presents. Maybe there lies the key to why his movies are as powerful are they are. And maybe in ten years' time Matt Reeves will be a common household name. My final point is Reeves' apparent zeal for building and shooting on large sets, constructed largely from natural resources (as opposed to green-screening the movie into existence), thus really bringing the movie's fictional world into reality - resembling the typical Christopher Nolan style, which I also much appreciate. In closing, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of my all-time favourite movies, ranking quite closely to its predecessor, and I highly recommend it to anyone who values a gripping narrative, gorgeous visuals, and superb acting wrapped together in a powerful film. I have seen it about five times since its 2014 release, and I plan on many more viewings. The trilogy is mostly solid the whole way through, and all three films are worth your time. If you love film and have yet to watch it, you're certainly missing out.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
375,pappysprite,What a horrible film!,2,20 July 2014,"You're kidding right? This must be one gigantic colossal joke. So many holes in this film to list. For one, the city of San Francisco would not deteriorate like that within 10 years. This was absolutely ridiculous. It looked like a gigantic apocalypse had taken place. The humans also stated they had power for a while with generators etc. they never bothered to venture out of the city to see if there were other survivors? Caesar and the other apes could barely get out the word NO in the beginning of the film and towards the end, Caesar was making full sentences. He also healed over night after Keri Russell operated on him. It was such a joke. The acting was horrible. No character development whatsoever. I felt like I was watching one of the weakest episodes of The Walking Dead or some other made for TV movie. Everyone keeps saying the CGI was great...that's the problem...you never really get the full facial expressions and everything doesn't quite look realistic. Why all the ammunition where the human survivors were? Why after 10 years is the environment where the humans still look like complete trash and destruction with garbage and other things all over. Can these people not clean up after themselves? I also love the fact that after 10 years they decide to go to the dam to try and get power. First, that was one small dam that apparently brought power to the whole city. Second, it only took like 5 people one day to fix the dam...such a joke. My thoughts are random right now as there was nothing realistic about this movie or made sense whatsoever. When they went back to Caesar's old house...the house looked like 1000 years had passes...dirt all over the walls etc....but the camcorder went right back on with no worries...yet everything was so eroded everywhere else...but things like that, the laptop, the ipad...instantly came on with no problems...the power does, the batteries...nothing had eroded...yet the outside buildings,inside the buildings looked like it had been through a nuclear war. I also had to laugh when they went to Caesar's house and there were house plants that still looked very healthy in their pits on the porch...after all those years and also on a covered porch. Wonder what kind of miracle grow they used? These people don't bother to go to the dam for over 10 years...then decide to go...Caesar and his army come back to their city and say leave us alone...yet they immediately go back. I could go on and on. At least with the original movie, time travel was easier to swallow than a virus that kills people and within 10 years , all the cities him the world have eroded to nothing. Honestly, there was no actor standout. I have seen better acting on Lifetime made for TV movies. Here is another thing I remembered...San Francisco makes contact with a military base that was going to come down at the end of the movie. This military base never bothered to go to a major city like San Francisco to see if there were survivors? People can live without power...and there looked to be like many vacant houses all over San Francisco where people could live...yet they all gathered in this underground like city world that looked all destroyed. I think this movie made a mockery of the original 1968 movie.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
376,tyse1,Apes. Together. Strong.,9,17 July 2014,"The title of this review being a direct quote from the movie also serves as a quick lesson in film making for any director looking to follow a similar path: Character is key, and when you've got the audience so immersed in the picture due to their love and care for non-human CG- created Apes more so than the arguably still strong human characters, you know it's going to turn out quite special. The fact that audience members can so easily relate to and thereby care deeply for our primate pals is of course due to the stunning motion capture CGI technology on show, such a method that is currently making huge strides in redefining the fantasy and sci-fie genre. It is because of this technological magic that our lead protagonist Caesar (played by Andy Serkis, mesmerizing) alongside other lead Apes look and feel so real.DOTPOTA is set some time in the fairly near future after ROTPOTA. Still in San Francisco, a group of Apes led by Caesar have made camp up in the hills, with small groups of humans still left scattered around the earth after the virus went viral. With Caesar striving for peace between humans and apes, things turn sour when another ape (Koba, genuinely frightening) has doubts about Caesar's leadership skills and contrasting feelings about the presence of humans near camp.A tad too long, the film can feel repetitive at times during the third act, with battle sequences seeming to occupy the majority of screen time and the lack of human interaction forcing too much ape talk which can be a tire to keep up with. However this is just nit-picking at what is probably one of the best movies so far this year, possibly the best in it's field. Right from the opening close-up of Caesar's war-painted face to the concluding set piece, it never ceases to amaze viewers, a compliment largely due to the masterfully crafted scripting and a plot that is constantly second guessing cliché expectations.In conclusion Dawn of the Planet of the Apes offers a huge step up from an already fantastic reboot, even if the editing department could have done a slightly better job. GO!!! (see it).",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Thank you!,7,17 November 2014,"If you have watched a million si-fi movies before, yes, you won't learn something you didn't know before; but, this movie is special because, at least, IT MAKES SENSE! I'm personally weirded out by almost all of the recent big budget movies, with stories which don't even make sense. SO many stupid big budget films, which directly insult our intelligence, and this is an exception! Amazingly shot and VERY archetypical in its approach, makes one at least think for a bit, what might happen IF the Apes of today ONLY learn how to use tools. They will pretty much take over...

Literally EVERY SINGLE PART of the story is nonsense.When I say ""nonsense,"" I mean that when a movie creates a world, it must stay true to that world. This movie is a massive wreck. I could write for 2 hours about everything wrong with it, but I don't want to. I will mention a few crushing details.The premise: over 90% of human life has been killed off.(just about the greatest thing I could imagine would be to reduce the human population of earth by 90%. It would not be a tragedy. It would be a blessing.)This would mean that the surviving human population would have approximately 1 entire square mile PER PERSON to live in in the contiguous 48 U.S. states. That's over 600 acres per person. That's utopia.They'd have enough fuel (diesel and gasoline) just sitting in all the reserves of the nation (and the various fuel stations) to run generator and vehicles for 100 years. Anyone with half a brain would move to the south eastern U.S. states with the temps are mild, growing seasons long and water plentiful.They would have NOTHING to fight over. I honestly can't think of anything sweeter that having the world's population reduced by 90%.The Apes could NOT have had the distribution of intelligence they exhibited within just 10 years of Ceasar and a few zoo apes getting their ""brain boost' back in the first film.Ceasar, the Ape leader, says at one point that they haven't seen a human in 10 years, and he wonders if their are even any left. That's ridiculous. There is not way that it would have taken 10 years for either Ape or Human to cross the bridge out of curiosity.There is certainly no way the Apes lived in perfect peace for 10 years. That's just a bull crap notion embraced by people who just don't like themselves. Mammal fight easily and often. No way around it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The film's underlying message is trite and has been expressed better in other films.Aside from the lacklustre plot and banal message, the character portrayal is also quite run-of-the-mill.All in all, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is typical Hollywood fare: family-friendly mediocrity.

People, when they take away your guns, then they are going to take everything. The Chinese were stupid for handing their guns over to the government. I saw the movie which looks good in 3 D, and I liked the part where the monkey, Buka shoots the leader with the gun and claims the humans shot him, then burns down their village, and claims the humans did that. That's what governments do to start wars, like 'Gulf of Tonkin' in Vietnam, when the U.S. painted our boats like Vietnamese boats and attacked our own boats to get support from our people to start a war.

Even though it's five years old now the CGI is absolutely flawless, the Apes are simply characters in the film and you accept that almost immediately. It's predecessor 'rise' was an excellent film but this edges it in pretty much every department, it's visually the best of the three 'Apes' films, has the best score and storyline, which is just chock full of dilemmas and character development. The film takes the time to show you background to all the major players - ape and human, and the film is all the better for it. The cinematography is superb and the film just has this dark foreboding mood throughout - it's just excellent and I simply cannot fault it.

382,lilguyollie,Summer of 2014 just keeps giving!!,10,6 August 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is obviously the sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes and carries on the story from the first movie as you would expect. The premise is that the Saimian (I think thats how it's spelt)flu has wiped out a most of humanity. Though as you would expect the Apes led by Caesar have created their own home in a Californian Forest. Eventually they discover an isolated pocket of humans looking for aid who they see as a potential threat. The story essentially focuses on the relationship between the two species with both groups just looking to thrive and survive whilst demonstrating how similar they are to each other through various events in the movie.Now to quote another critic I follow, this movie was never afraid to take risks and always kept me guessing. The story originally didn't appeal to me when I heard about it but the movie works so hard at making you emotionally invested in it that it's just too hard to resist. It has it's share of light hearted moments delicately balanced with harrowing dramatic scenes that tug at your heart strings fused with some fight sequences that truly are a sight to behold. The entire cast of this movie were truly fantastic, the Apes look and act like Apes and the humans in the movie are interesting as opposed to just being there as in a lot of movies (i.e. Avatar). Seriously if Andy Serkis doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for this performance it will be the biggest awards farce since Ricky Gervais was allowed to host the Golden Globes. As you can expect the CGI is fantastic, when you see the Apes conveying emotion it looks so genuine it gives Kristen Stewart a run for her money. The only issue I really have with this movie is that at times it seemed that this movie lacked pace. Personally I didn't mind it too much but if your a expecting a purely testosterone fuelled action adventure then this movie isn't for you.Overall this movie excelled in near every way possible. The story was great, the ending was satisfying and perfectly set up the sequel without baiting it too much like in the X-men movies (I swear to god all they talk about is this upcoming war which whilst it seems cool begins to get repetitive and nauseating). The acting, cinematography, music and CGI were all terrific and managing to pull them all off together so well truly makes this movie worthwhile. In sequel terms this is so awesome in comparison that it rivals the Dark Knight trilogy I'm not even kidding. Now I can only hope that this movie has a sequel that does the previous two true justice.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

385,invernessmovieclub,Hail Caesar!,8,17 July 2014,"Planet of the Apes is one of the longest running movie franchises in Cinema history. The original from 1968 remains a classic to this day and has spawned four sequels, a television series and a failed re-boot in 2001. It was a surprise then that 20th Century Fox announced in 2010 that they would re-booting the series and Rise of the Planet of the Apes – an origin story - was released the following year with spectacular results and a sequel was green-lit almost instantly. It has taken three years for the sequel to hit the screens and whilst it doesn't hit the heights of Rise, it is a worthy sequel. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (DOTPOTA) is set ten years after Rise as the clever introduction shows how quickly the ALZ112 virus (or Simian flu - briefly featured at the end of Rise) has spread around the world, wiping out of most of humanity. Caesar (the super intelligent ape from Rise) and his fellow apes live peacefully in the forests surrounding San Francisco, happy in the knowledge they are alone without mankind's interference. But their peace is soon interrupted by a small group of immune and desperate humans led by Malcolm (played by Aussie actor Jason Clarke) who are looking to re-establish civilisation by re-starting a dam which will give humans power for the first time in years. Startled by the apes' ability to speak, Malcolm and Caesar form a grudging truce and agree to work with each other for the good of both parties. Caesar is well aware that humans will bring force if he does not agree to assist. But tension, not just between the two species but also amongst the two groups threatens the peace and it isn't long before all hell breaks loose. The key to this whole movie working is believing that the apes are real and fleshed out characters. Not only are the visual effects incredible – within ten minutes you have forgotten you aren't looking at real apes – the actors behind the apes perform wonders too. Andy Serkis (responsible for the game-changing Gollum in Lord of the Rings) is behind Caesar and he has given him a complex and believable personality – fierce leader, family ape and a warrior protective of his territory – clearly the hours of studying apes has paid off immensely. Caesar's fellow ape Koba is also a stand out and the token bad ape who threatens to run riot. Such is their quality you can almost sympathise with them. The two human leads – Clarke along with Keri Russell are both on good form and are well supported by Gary Oldman amongst others. On the downside DOTPOTA is quite slow – building tension is admirable but it overstays its welcome slightly. Plot-wise it is fairly predictable and offers no real surprises or twists but that is a minor gripe of Summer Hollywood Blockbuster whose purpose is to entertain – and entertain it does – Hail Caesar!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The plot was full of holes, the script idiotic, even the sets were unbelievable. When I think of how good the original Planet of the Apes movies are it makes me want to cry. The people did such dumb things like just standing there with their mouth agape when the apes come to speak to them; if you haven't been able to contact anyone by radio in ten years why is it an emergency now; why wouldn't you move the arms to where you are living; why wouldn't you use solar, wind, or even bicycle power.

387,JoeyCelia,Planet of Greatness,9,16 July 2014,"Electric, vibrant, emotional, and heart-warming is what describes Matt Reeves 2014 Summer blockbuster film Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. This movie skyrockets past Rise of the Planet of the Apes, giving this film a much higher adrenaline rush. From start to finish it makes you wonder what is going to happen next and it depicts brilliantly the struggle of ""ape v human"", ""ape v ape"", and even... ""human v human"". You will appreciate this film 10 times more if you have seen Rise. This is because in Rise, they help you get attached to Caesar and how he is really just like a regular person. Caesar is the peace between the Apes and Humans, but unfortunately there is always a villain, in this case it is Koba. If you became attached to Caesar in Rise, you will become more attached in Dawn. I am looking forward to watching the next war, but also skeptical of where the series is going. What is next for Caesar? In my opinion, Caesar is now the star of the show, and will be the leading role in the next film. Unlike the previous 2. Tip of the hat to the actors in this film, they were all phenomenal.

The title sequences are poor. I miss Saul Bass. The situation of the humans was not very well explained and specially the reason how they were living with scarce electricity and no communication with other cities for so long.

NOT. It's a good thing this DVD was totally free to me or I would feel cheated. Of course, that is two hours I can't get back, but at least I am not out a couple of bucks to boot. There are a half-dozen actual actors involved and the rest are extras and apes. Story holes big enough to drive a tank through...which happens with about a half-hour left.

This is a smart, entirely grossing and heart warming follow up that surpasses its already seller prequel. The characters in this movie are so well done from the apes down to the humans. You understand the motivations here and you feel what each character is feeling. I feel I got a very realistic portrayal of the inside of an extra intelligent ape community, their complexities, their similarities to us. Just stellar film making all around. Caesar has more depth here than he did in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, here is a father a husband and a leader. He is the mosses of the apes and you see his importance to the tribe every time he steps on screen. These apes owe him everything. I thought I would miss James Franco here but Jason Clarke provides plenty of interesting moments here to make you fall in love with his character just as much as you did with James Franco. The action here is well done and the villains really stand out, you've got Gary Oldman who is sorta a play or more a mirror of Koba the villain on the Ape side. These two men are both similar in their one sided view on each others race. Its only Ceasar and Jason Clarke's characters who see the possibility of peace between ape and human. The movie leaves an obvious opening for the clearly bound to happen sequel. Just as I had dubbed Xmen Days of Future Past king of the summer this movie came and stole the crown. This truly is one the greatest years for movies I've ever seen.

392,jaredmartin-464-711711,Does Dawn Surpass Rise?,8,17 July 2014,"Dawn, the anticipated sequel to Rise, has finally been released, but how does it measure up to it's predecessor. Simple answer is its just as good, and in some ways better. As far as sequels go, Dawn is about as good as they come, and like any sequel should, it builds upon what was laid out in the previous installment. Ten years have passed since Caesar, and his band of genetically enhanced apes, fought their way across the Golden Gate Bridge, and over time the apes have built their own primitive, yet strong society. The humans however are quite desperate, and do whatever they can to keep electrical power running, amongst the remaining survivors. As luck would have it, the humans must cross into the apes territory in order to keep the power going.The basic theme of this movie is about survival, and neither the apes, nor humans wan't to be the weaker group. The story on the surface is pretty simplistic, much like it was with Rise, but like Rise, the true strength of Dawn is in it's ape stars. Caesar once again portrayed by the brilliant Andy Serkis, is the heart of the film, and it's about his struggle to remain in control of his ape society. Koba portrayed by Toby Kebbell, is gruff, deadly, and at times quite tragic. Koba was introduced in Rise, but in Dawn, he's a fully realized character that steals every scene he's in. Caesar want's peace, but for Koba, peace is not an option, because humans cannot be trusted, as he points out, literally on himself, the ""true"" nature of humans. It's a issue that Caesar, and Koba could never see eye to eye on, and as a result begins to sever the bond between the two. Koba hates humans, because of how he was treated, and once he gains control he becomes everything he hated about the humans, with no compassion, or remorse, even killing apes who oppose him. When its comes to characters, Caesar and Koba, are without doubt the most compelling to watch, where as the other characters, are less interesting. In Rise the ape characters out shined the human ones, and with Dawn the outcome is no different. That said, the human characters are written well enough that they're serviceable to the story. The relationship between the apes, and humans creates interesting moments. How different, aside form appearance, are we really. It's a question that humans seem to struggle with throughout history. There's good, and bad, in every society, and people always feel threatened by something they don't understand. In Dawn there's apes, and humans on both sides, some are hostile, where as others wan't peace. That is the very nature of people, and since these apes are as smart as humans, they're also capable of being as arrogant. Its social commentary like this, that sprinkled throughout the film, that keeps things interesting.So what does Dawn do better than Rise, the world and scope is far more epic, and the effects are visually stunning, as are the performances, both human characters, and to a greater extent the apes. The weaknesses are similar to the flaws in Rise, narrative issues such as logic/plot holes, and a rushed, yet satisfying third act. Personally I felt Rise was more intimate, and emotional, whereas Dawn is more spectacle, though still emotional. All things considered, this is strong sequel to a good franchise, and does what any sequel should do, leave it's audience wanting more. 8.5/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Not a great entertainer though it has some good fighting scenes and funny parts. The movie is so slow that you feel like forwarding the scenes till a good one comes.

396,RyanNilsen,"""GO!!!"" See Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.",8,25 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the ApesDirected by Matt Reeves Starring: Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and Toby KebbellHollywood is often criticized for making bad sequels to movies. I do not believe this statement because those who think this are not ""seeing"" the good ones. Take Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the sequel to the ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which caught everybody off guard back in 2011. Fans of the old Planet of the Apes movies thought it was going to be nonsense because the Apes were special effects and not Kim Hunter in 5 pounds of ape make-up. What the average moviegoer did not know at the time was that Andy Serkis was in the movie. With roles like that of Gollum, King Kong, Ape (Caesar), and Godzilla, actor Andy Serkis has brought many miraculous creatures to life on the big-screen through motion and performance capture technology. Now he plays ape Caesar once more, giving a transcending performance that will make you believe these were real apes! Dawn takes place ten years after Rise where a virus has killed a vast majority of the human population, leaving only a few groups of survivors around the world. The group of focus here is outside of New York City and is being led by a man named Dreyfus (played by an always good Gary Oldman), who has come across a big dilemma. His camp needs fuel and power and the only solution lies at a damn where another camp is, only this one is run by Apes. Caesar and the apes have created a bit of a society for themselves over the past decade and do not want to risk losing everything they've fought so hard for. However, war between the Apes and Humans is inevitable and one side has to give. ​Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) directs this Blockbuster-film spectacularly to the last frame. It is without a doubt his best work and will probably open many doors for him as a director in the future. The greatest compliment you can give to a film with a lot of visual effects is not even noticing them. The visual effects in this film look so real and are the best I have seen since the blue people in Avatar. I believed all of these apes were real and was engaged every second they were on screen. The character Caesar is one of the most interesting characters so far in 2014. Even when he is not on screen you are wondering where he is and what he is up to. Though there are many terrific aspects of this film there are a few problems. Other than Caesar, all of the characters are one-dimensional ""what you see is what you get"" characters. The acting is on point all around, but these characters were poorly written and it is a shame because there were signs of some interesting back-stories for a few of them. There are also a few logic problems with the film, which may sound funny because it's a movie with talking Apes on Horse, but I cannot get into these issues without spoiling some rather huge plot points. Overall, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a really fun time. It is not only a great movie, but also a great sequel!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
397,Foal24,"The antidote for poor, unoriginal, action blockbusters",9,26 July 2014,"We've come a long way since 'Jar Jar Binks'. From a CGI character so bad that he almost single-handedly destroyed the Star Wars universe, to a group of CGI super-smart apes so impressive that they have completely reinvigorated a 1960's classic. (Let's ignore the forgettable 90's remake).It's hard to even begin reviewing 'Dawn'. It's just so damn good. If you liked its predecessor 'Rise', this is significantly better. If you didn't care for the first in this reboot/re imagining-prequel series, see this anyway. Some have said 'Rise' was a little slow. I disagree, but I can see that point of view. 'Dawn' by comparison is faster than 'The Flash' on anabolic steroids.So, let's start with the apes. Unless you really try, it's hard not to believe that these chimps, gorillas, and orangutan are real. They completely outshine their human actor counterparts. That's no insult to the fine actors in this film, who are all excellent. Gary Oldman, in particular, gives a powerful portrayal of the emotionally tortured leader of the survivors of the man-made virus which has all but wiped out the human race.But, the apes. The apes! The depth of of expression in their faces, their authentic mannerisms, the exquisite detail in both sound and visuals, the way they interact and communicate with each other (which is 90% sign language with some basic spoken sentences), all add up to the single best display of CGI in the history of cinema (get out of the way Avatar!!!). But, to only praise the CGI would be to overlook the actors behind the apes. Led by Andy Serkis (the veteran of motion capture performances like 'Gollum' and 'King Kong'), the portrayals of the actors that bring the apes to life are extraordinary. Their movements and mannerisms are so authentic that you forget that there's a human in a skin tight suit covered in motion sensors cavorting around like a monkey underneath the digital images on screen. Serkis deserves an Oscar for his efforts here.There's also a great story on display. The slow burn of the smouldering events which gradually escalate misunderstanding and fear to all out war are pieced together with rare expertise. The way the human/simian conflict mirrors those of our own history is a poignant reminder of the ease with which our hatreds and prejudices blind us.One measure of the quality of the film is, although you're waiting for the inevitable battle scenes to arrive, it's an easy wait. The drama, tension, and especially, the evolving relationships between Serkis's 'Caesar', leader of the apes, and his family and tribe members keep the movie rollicking along for the first two thirds. And, then, when the final conflict arrives it does not disappoint. It's part sci-fi, part drama, part action, but all class. Go see this movie.

It reeuses the usual elements of a Hollywood maximum-profits movie: them-versus-us, valor, pride, hatred, revenge, leader-loyalty, treason, hope, and love. Also, this film is an insult to all the indigenous peoples ever portrayed by Hollywood, as the apes all speak and behave in a way that has usually been used to portray non-Western communities. Throw in a couple of celebrity actors, toss it a few times, and you have a blockbuster. Do NOT waste time, intellect, or money wathcing this film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
399,denizmoraligil,This years best summer movie so far,9,11 July 2014,"Let's assume that you had already seen ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". It is now a decade later, mankind at least in San Francisco is on its knees. Much of human population has been wiped out by simian flu and the rest by wars among the survivors. In this post apocalyptic world the freed aped population hasn't fared much better; living like a stone age tribe, they only learned how to make spears, ride horses and speak some English. Even though human and ape populations haven't met yet, a clash is inevitable. This film focuses on the war between human and apes for dominance. It has a well written, flawless story. CGI is above average and believable. There is a great deal of it: monkeys, horses, a bear and a very big explosion. Also acting is above average. The casting of relatively unknown actors (except for Gary Oldman) could have been a disadvantage, however it all seems to work. It smoothly fits the pieces from the last film together and opens doors for another episode in the series. Is it worth watching?If you don't like monkeys, don't bother. But it is entertaining, there is hardly wasted time, fast paced and it's a good summer entertainment. This is the best summer movie I have seen so far in 2014. And one final spoiler. Don't be fooled by the sound effects at the very end of the film, it is coming from the speakers.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
400,mg-soikkeli,A racist allegory with b/w politics,4,26 July 2014,"I have to admit I was positively surprised how beautiful the CGI-images of simian life were and how genuinely functional mixture of paleofiction and sf the first 20 minutes of this film was.And after that everything went horribly wrong. As an allegory this is the most openly racist Hollywood-film I've seen for ages, a b/ w 'species-war' where all the humans are white. The setting is the same as in 60's westerns where they were really trying to use the viewpoint of indigenous people, but the plot and characters are more simplistic. For example, they say that the virus has left alive only those who are 'genetically' best part of humankind, and then we see the society with mainly white characters?How else should we interpret this movie than a racist nightmare story, when there are only black apes and white humans against each other? And why this worst human character has to be Dreyfus? To point out that the most unreliable soldier might have been noticed just because of his (jewish) name? And then - how should we see the meaning of the 'ape' ruler: is he really like Cesar or more like Malcolm X? The original Planet of the Apes had also it's racial subtext, but nothing has really changed in four decades, has it?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
401,mukool-hastak,A sequel to a scifi movie that matches or even surpasses its predecessor ?!,10,16 July 2017,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is remember fondly because 'Return of the King' was a cinematic masterpiece and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was great origins story. 'The Two Towers' does not get talked about as much as the first and the third, however it plays a supremely critical role of carrying the story forward, building upon it in a meaningful way and setting up the stage for a grand finale.That is exactly what 'Dawn of Apes' does as well.We were treated to a realistic and masterful adaptation of a classic sci-fi franchise in 'Rise of Apes'. 'Dawn of Apes' bears the brunt of improving upon that masterpiece easily. It tells a story, both emotional and exciting about how Caesar tries hard to make a home for his new colony of intelligent Apes, knowing full well that the cruel human race wont let them live by themselves so easily. But the undoing of peace is caused as often by enemies within as by external foes.This is a thrilling tale that begins with tolerance, attempts at peace, friendship, then betrayal from within and finally an unavoidable descent into war. It is aided along expertly by Andy Serkis who by now has to start getting at least Oscar Nominations for his work with motion capture. Because, while the special effects themselves are spectacular throughout the movie, it is ultimately Serkis's mastery of acting that breathe life into the Caesar and make us think we are witnessing a very very real character.The performances from the other Apes, primarily Toby Kebbel as Koba, and from Jason Clarke are themselves quite excellent and keep the audiences on-edge till the very end of the movie by truly immersing the audience into an intriguing narrative. Little would you expect to be so captivated in the drama by CGI Apes! The plot itself is so well crafted, it lends credence to the violent third act, which in another movie, would have been dismissed as meaningless exaggeration.A separate note on the CGI itself: it is so well done that you might as well believe they brought in real Apes, gave them some real brain-enhancing serum and they actually acted in front of the camera ! A true masterpiece of motion capture, led by the man himself, Andy Serkis. The other special effects used to make up a post-apocalyptic San Fransisco are equally worthy of mention. The entire world feels alive in a way that helps immerse the audience in the story.So, to sum it up, not only does this film move the Ape trilogy forward but also offers a complete stand-alone sci-fi experience. A worthy successor to a worthy reboot!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
402,ccponds,All Hail Caesar!,8,11 July 2014,"The apes are back in town, and they are more than ready to throw down with Gary Oldman and company! ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" continues to prove that this rebooted franchise is able to compete with many of the 2014 films on multiple levels. This is helped by the fact that this film improved upon many of the elements of its 2011 predecessor, and that is not a compliment I can give to every film that continues a franchise. Andy Serkis reprises his role in this film as Caesar, the leader of the apes. At this point, I would assume it is rather safe to say that no one does motion capture performances the way he does. Throughout the film, one will be forgiven for mistaking his performance for what it is; acting. From the way he walks to the way he talks, Andy Serkis sells this role and gives life to an animated chimp that could not be more believable if it were really an ape playing the part. But honestly, every single one of the apes is excellently portrayed through this movie. The visuals on the apes are stunning, and I strongly recommend that the audience just take a few moments while watching the film to look really closely at them. It is incredible what animators can accomplish these days!I could go on and on, praising this movie's visuals and performances, but I doubt I will say anything that has not already been said. In a nutshell; this movie is a visual masterpiece. Rather, I am going to say that this film really focuses on telling a story that delves into human nature, and how we deal with people, ideas, or beliefs that are different from our own. Through the apes versus human conflict, I could not help envisioning or thinking about how humans fight or disagree with each other over very obvious misunderstandings. This movie brings these issues to the cinema floor, but disguises them in guns, apes, and warfare. In all honesty, the few complaints I have are not to be blamed on the apes. Instead, the minor complaints actually revolve around the surviving humans. I will not include any specific examples, but there are moments when the humans and apes encounter each other that have very predictable outcomes. The humans also feel a little two dimensional at times, and I say this because there are a few characters that could certainly have benefited from stronger dialog or a stronger back story. In fact, the real problem with the humans is that the film does not focus on developing their characters as much as those of the apes. If one were to compare almost any ape to the majority of the human characters, the apes will almost always a have much clearer motive, more depth, and just a better screen presence. And although the apes do not speak much, their communication is still better written than some of the human dialog. Expositional lines are used a few times in the first act of the film, and I believe this is due to the fact that this is an entirely new human cast. While the apes are mostly a returning cast, the humans need to be introduced to the audience. This is something that I hope the third film will not have to worry about; I really hope that next time the director keeps the same cast so that we do not have to be introduced to another new group of humans, thus slowing down the storytelling.Ultimately, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a very, very good film. I did have some complaints with a few characters and lines, but for the most part this film is extremely effective in continuing the return the apes to the silver screen. It takes a franchise that looked to be beyond saving and has turned it into what will likely become a box office contender whenever it hits theaters for the foreseeable future.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
403,robybaggio18,"Nice, but suffers because it's just a sequel",6,1 August 2014,"A kind of a pleasant surprise for me. I expected just another dumb CGI- boosted sequel, but the movie does posses some qualities which made me look at my watch only once during the whole screening. It's nothing new, I have seen many movies which show clashes of civilizations, violent consequences of actions made by nervous and ignorant individuals. That part of the movie was a standard plot of that kind and represented a solid backbone for everything else. On both sides there were enough different characters to drive the conflict/truce plot. The power plant subplot seems like a good choice, not too complicated to grasp and gives humans a strong motive for insisting to come back to the woods.The weak side of this kind of movie is its over-reliance on CGI. I never really believe in the ape side of the story. Apes become smart in this whole ""Planet of the Apes"" universe, but if screen is filled with hundreds of CGI animated characters which hunt CGI animated deer, which fight CGI animated bears it very easily loses touch with any reality. Deer and bears are real animals, it's kind of sad to see real animals animated for a motion picture involving cities and humans. With apes, it doesn't get any better because they are all animated. Not just 15% with the background characters being real filmed chimps (which I'm sure is possible to make). Such a cheap method, such laziness.I give it 6/10, solid movie nicely executed. But not more than that. Maybe because it is just one of the numerous sequels. In hands of a capable director, with production focused on one movie only and more courage for live filming, there was material here for a masterpiece.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
404,amir_ro88,"Not the one I need, but the one I deserved",8,21 July 2014,"First of all, I must state that at first I was planning to watch the new Transformer movie, but since i missed the time so i choose to watch this movie instead and I am glad that I made that choice.To be honest, I was expecting a violent movie where human heads on a spike is seen everywhere, apes massacring humans and eat their babies alive or a simple word; a genocide. But instead what i get is a very ""National Geographic"" scenes in the first 10 minutes which makes me wonder is this a TV show or a movie? I came watching this movie with a quite low expectation and it surprises me with a well developed plot, a stunning emotional and intelligence portrayed by these apes and the conflicts that leads to war between apes and the human colony. These apes kinda reminds me of the Red Indian people, but this time the ""Red Indians"" will win and the American cowboys will fall from their horses and die.When i see the word ""dawn"" I was expecting the apes is already conquering the whole planet and humans is already enslaved/massacred in this movie. Perhaps what I really don't like to see would probably happens in the next movie, which probably titled ""The War of the Planet of the Apes"". But I'm still intrigued with what might happens in the next movie.And I would like to end this review with a quote from myself for the movie; ""It will be the end of mankind when humans start thinking like an ape and lost their sense of humanity.p/s: an exciting film to watch for anyone with a brain that they use for thinking ;)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
405,Sparse,Perspective & Possibility: A Shakespearean Spectacle,9,23 July 2017,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an ambitious, nuanced, commanding endeavor. Though I find more enjoyment in the rampant momentum of Rise, Dawn is admittedly the better film--far more realized in allegory and character, despite falling short of its predecessor on less-consequential facets. Matt Reeves is perhaps the best director we could have possibly received for this film, and his efforts pay off spectacularly.Reeves is not only a long time fan of Planet of the Apes, but he understands all its layers and nuances (as revealed via audio commentary). Overall, Dawn is more slowly- paced than Rise, yet no less mesmerising. The production design by James Chinlund thrives with history--all scenes but the skyscraper sequence were actually shot on a physical set or location, and the film breathes with natural lighting (including burning down the ape village set for real). There's a constant undercurrent of character-driven intensity from the apes in this film, and a level of technical innovation and ambition that's nigh-comparable to the likes of Avatar and The Lord of the Rings. We're talking shooting motion-capture in the mud and rain, sometimes shooting over a thousand takes, and monumental undertakings in editing. The craftsmanship here is unparalleled.Director of photography Michael Seresin seems like a perfect successor to develop Lesnie's window/cage motif from Rise, seeing as how ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" highlights his repertoire. Unfortunately, I didn't notice much in the way of symbolic sensibilities besides that of Caesar's face opening/closing the film. Nonetheless, the shots are often beautiful and thriving with scope. The effects by WETA are even more astonishing than before, and there's no competition for their accomplishments here.I have problems with select aspects of the direction though, such as elements of the combat sequences, but primarily, disparities within overall scope. Part of this film is trying to tell an epic, but another part of it is relaying a humble, transitionary story. That's a compelling idea in its own right, but sometimes the confines of the world got to me--with connective sequences from the ape village to the bridge to the human compound, making the world feel somewhat small despite the massive implications of the preceding pandemic. I'll also admit that though one-handed machine-gun-wielding apes-on-horseback are awesome, it's a stretch of reality. You can reasonably assume they reload off-camera, but still. . . . If anything drags in this movie, it's the battle sequences--as the real focal point of tension is the characters, and these sequences feel like a digression sometimes. Some more minor flaws include a handful of clichés, such as the introductory montage and opening/closing on Caesar's face, though are effective (or even powerful) within their individual contexts.The initial screenplay was written by Rise's duo Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, later revised by Mark Bomback and Reeves himself when he entered the project. Though the plot's admittedly a cliché (taking after classic westerns), there's still a lot to praise. Foremost, there's the Shakespearean tragedy: Koba and Caesar, the story about two brothers (as distinguished by Reeves), their clashing philosophies, and inevitable betrayal. If you look closely, you'll also find a meticulous illustration of duality: Caesar and Koba, Malcolm and Dreyfus, humans and apes. . . . war and peace. This film is a multifaceted study on perspective and delusions of infallibility, exhibiting an entire spectrum of viewpoints across a spectrum of affiliations, articulating shades of grey that would normally be presented as a false dichotomy. In this we get a series of reversals, such as humans and apes alike struggling to stay united, humans realizing that they are too animalistic, and apes realizing they are too human. All of this is churning inside the beautiful, fleeting moment in which peace is a possibility.This film also delves back into the franchise's signature sociopolitical commentary, with some light content on gun violence, racism, and international relations. It's still not quite as intricate as 1968's masterpiece, but it's worthy of the Planet of the Apes title.Rise developed a thriving history behind Caesar that Dawn builds off of excellently. Caesar is a character defined by an internal study of duality: belonging to two worlds, and hence belonging truly to neither, dooming him to a certain sense of isolation. The apes on screen thrive with depth in their dawning civilization, and though apes can't physiologically produce vocalized speech or tears, these stretches of reality are executed mostly tastefully. The human characters however present an interesting flaw, in which I sympathise with them, but I don't especially ""care"" about them. They work well in their depiction of an emotional reality, and within their role in the film's themes, but they simply aren't as individually complex and emotive as the apes (which was a near-impossible balance to strike in the first place, given the context).The human performance highlights are Oldman and Russell. Clarke is competent, despite a sometimes dry chemistry with the other actors. The only truly iffy ape performance for me was Thurston, who at times felt emotionally constipated--but besides that, the apes are great! Karin Konoval is delightful and has a touching scene with Kodi Smit-McPhee. Kebbel delivers a heartbreaking performance as Koba, exhibiting a perfectly messy fusion of hurt, anger, restraint, and obsession. Serkis is truthfully just as riveting without the CG, having seen behind-the-scenes footage. He's an incredible motion-capture actor because he's an incredible actor. That's all there is to it.I don't like Giacchino's score as much as Doyle's (and I really wish he made an effort for thematic continuity), but it's still better than your average film score. The orchestration feels a little thin at times, or like a score to an animated movie, but the darker segments are fantastic--especially where Giacchino delves into more avant- garde, Jerry Goldsmith-influenced sensibilities. This is easily one of the best Apes films, and is solidifying what's looking to be one hell-of-a trilogy.Score: 9/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
406,xmichaelraine,Pretty Solid All Around!,8,16 July 2014,"In 2011, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' caught everybody off guard. After the terribly misguided remake of the original 'Planet of the Apes' in 2001 by Tim Burton, people weren't expecting much from another reboot of the franchise. So it was a pleasure to discover a clever, entertaining new entry into the franchise. Instead of actors portraying apes in heavy make-up; We were giving brilliant CGI apes, and a central ape named Caesar portrayed through motion capture by the king of the artform, Andy Serkis. This new film is a worthy continuation of that 2011 reboot, although it lacks in some aspects. Regardless, this is a solid summer sequel with unbelievably realistic CGI, solid performances, and heavy emotional resonance. We begin 10 years after the conclusion of the last film. The 'Simian Flu' has spread around the world and wiped out most of human life. The apes on the other hand are doing just fine. Flourishing actually, living in the dense forest of San Francisco in an impressive fort-like structure built from the trees surrounding them. Ceasar is still the leader amongst the apes, and their loyalty to him is unflinching. Early on, we see two younger apes in the woods hunting, when they come across a human wandering alone from a group of humans. This alarms the entire ape tribe, and Ceasar with all of his mightiness speaks once more and tells the humans to leave.It so happens that a population of humans have a genetic immunity (at least for now) to the Simian flu. They're residing in San Francisco, but are on the verge of using up all of their power reserves. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) returns with his group from the woods and informs the humans leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) about the exceptional apes in the woods. Dreyfus is determined to reach a dam reserve in the woods that can restore power to their city, and let them begin to rebuild their world. And he will get this done, at whatever cost. Malcolm insists that he and his crew can get the apes trust through Ceasar, that will allow them to rig the dam without any conflict. But then, we wouldn't have a movie. So as anyone should see coming, there is much conflict through betrayal, and mistrust; Leading to the last hour of the movie that plays out exactly how one would expect. War.Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) has taken a definitive dark, broody tone in this film. For me personally, it feels like 2 films in 1. After the first hour of the film, I was convinced I was watching a masterpiece. Then once the cards were laid out, and we realize that we've been building to an exuberant action film for the latter half; It's just okay. The sum of these two halves balance out for me to become one good film. Not great. Not groundbreaking. But a good film. My biggest issue against it is the amount of emotion and time spent building the ape characters, which I appreciate. But then dissolving all of this time into an hour long battle sequence in the end. We form bonds with Caesar's family, and his inner circle of most trusted apes. They've all evolved a form of communication with hand gestures (we read subtitles), and through this language, and the miracle of facial motion capture; We understand their emotions. We see into their souls. This is the strongest point of the film for me, and I wish it could have stayed on this track throughout. They revisit it towards the end, but we've already been distracted. However it's the first time I believe in this long standing series of originals, reboots, and remakes that we really see into the apes world and psyche. For that, I applaud Reeves and his team. And the work that Andy Serkis does with this motion capturing is unbelievable. If not an Oscar nomination, the man needs high recognition as an actor. The work he does which includes Gollum in the LOTR series, King Kong (2005), and countless other films; The man is extraordinary. His movements, dialect, facial expressions. It's all spot on.In conclusion, this is another solid entry into this Summer's array of blockbusters. I still prefer 'Rise' over this one. Perhaps it was due to my low expectations and high reward back then. Who knows? Regardless, 'Dawn' has solid performances from good cast. It's an emotional ride for the first half, and then an action packed (perhaps too much so) roller coaster for the second half. Some people have hailed it as flawless. I could've used a bit less. However, even I can admit: An ape on horseback firing duel assault rifles, is simply badass.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
407,stansellb,Dawn of an awesome reboot,9,14 November 2014,"I really like where this rebooted franchise is going. It took me a long time to get around to seeing the first one and I imagine it's for the reasons most people had: The first movies with Heston just seem silly now. Not to mention the first reboot was utter crap. So naturally I had reservations about ANOTHER reboot of this obviously silly franchise. But it's not silly at all. In the age of biological scares and pharmaceutical companies clamoring for the next dollar and neurological diseases affecting more and more people, the premise of these movies actually seems... viable. Dare I say, realistic. Not just the premise, but you actually care about these characters. And I found myself actually caring more about the apes than I did the humans. Dawn re-emphasizes everything that's set up in Rise and continues the story many years after its cliffhanger ending. It explores the origins of human hatred and bitterness through the burgeoning ape society. There is good and evil on both sides and ironically enough, the film brings us to understand and even empathize with both. The beauty of this movie is that in the end you really don't know who you're cheering for because everyone is justified and everyone is (in some sense) doing the right thing.Do yourself a favor and even if you have reservations about this reboot, go find Dawn (but not before you've seen Rise) and give it at least one viewing. I'm confident you'll want to view both of these films again and again and that they'll most assuredly find a place in your Blu-Ray collection.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
408,Stanley39,"good monkey vs bad monkey, good human vs bad human",4,16 July 2014,"All the good human wants to do is to restart the power plant. The good monkey is OK with that, but the bad monkey worries (probably with good reason) that once the power plant is up, humans will kill off all the monkeys. So when the bad human starts shooting off a gun, the monkeys attack. That's the whole movie. Most of the monkeys are computer-generated except the main characters, who are still people in monkey suits. The whole movie seems to happen at night or inside dark buildings. The 3-D adds very little and could have been left out. Overall, boring, dark, and predictable. It is designed to be a prequel to one or two more profitable entries in the franchise.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
409,sims39-56-151468,Eating a choc-top was the only good thing,3,17 July 2014,"Before I start, it's worth noting that I'm a semi-professional writer and have a film directing and writing major, so I know a little about story and am not just a hating buffoon.So, I was invited to a special screening of this film before it was officially released. I invited one of my friend's, a sound engineer who liked movies. We had free wine, and I bought a choc-top.Honestly, the best thing about this movie was knowing that my friend was forced to watch it. Sitting through it was very hard. There were a lot of 'flowery' (normally I would say gay, but I don't want the PC Police crucifying me) moments.And quite frankly, I ranted about the main problem before I went in: the main character is a CGI ape. Same problem as the previous remake. I don't care about monkeys. They are cute as all hell, and I like visiting them at the zoo, but they are still animals. I will cry and love a human a lot more than a monkey or any animal. I love my cat but will probably not need a therapist when he dies, but will need one when people I hold dear to me, pass away.Even if I could somehow get emotionally invested, the character is CGI, fake, created by humans who are good at art and software. It's hard for me to forget this and to convince my mind that it's real. Sure I can drink free wine and lose myself within the story when aided by choc-top, but subconsciously, no. That's pretty much it. How the heck was I meant to obtain catharsis when the majority of characters, especially main ones, were apes, along with CGI?And, there are some plot holes and unrealistic events within this film also.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It's first part was spellbinding and I had very high expectation from the 2nd part since characters are very raw here, nothing fancy no giant machines, there are CGIs however main motive of the movie is to convey a story which is compelling.Movie gives you everything, shy of relief, happiness, an inside view of how apes have formed their world and still want to see another spices - Humans on planet earth. Just like first part this part as well is battle between good/bad, trust/betrayal, anger/wisdom, relations between good human and apes. Very rare movies these days leave you thinking after you leave the hall, this movie is one of them. I am already excited to see 3rd installment of this series which is due in July 2016. Two thumbs up for this movie, go for it. There are not many movies in 2014 worth watching for, this one is. Do not miss.

411,brian-2266,"Powerful, Engaging, Haunting, and Beautiful",9,13 July 2014,"I did not have high hopes for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a good movie, and fun to watch, but I knew what to expect, and I was right.The last time I said ""That was one of the best movies I've ever seen"" was 13 years ago when I saw Beautiful Mind. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of the best movies I've ever seen.This film is powerful. You go in knowing what has to happen, especially if this story line follows the same general story of Planet of the Apes, but how it gets there is extremely moving, and quite powerful.The film will engage you like few movies can. Unlike most typical fiction, the creator the story will usually clearly define for you who the protagonist and antagonist are. In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, those lines are not clearly drawn. This fact will engage you in the plight of the story for both, almost equally, and surprise you in the end.The movie is haunting, I think mostly because the premise of how they got to where they are is not so far outside the realm of possibility for us. While it's obviously doubtful apes will ever rise up against humans, the post human era haunts most people just a little bit, and this is done very well in this film.Finally, it's a beautifully done movie. The effects, CGI, cinematography, and the acting are nearly flawless. The landscape they have created in a post-human world are as creepy as they are beautiful. From the plant and animal life taking over a major metropolitan area over the years without human existence, to the homes the apes have built themselves high among the trees, there's always some point of beauty to every scene.I cannot recommend this film more. See it in the theater, and if you can, see it in 3D. There are not too many overt 3D scenes, but it adds a depth to the film that just makes it all that more enjoyable.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
412,DTKinetic,Dawn Delivers Drama where Rise Delivered Adventure,7,15 July 2014,"When a second installment of a series is released, it's always crucial to see how it built up from its foundation. In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, multiple ideas, themes, and discoveries introduced on the first film are expanded upon, improving the series' direction as a whole.This includes: Being able to behold--in thorough detail--the lifestyle and construction of the apes' habitat as reigned by Caesar. Establishing more ape characters who are emotionally resonant and well developed with their sense of identity. Seeing the devastating effects of the spread virus in San Francisco.And Finally:Building on the relationship aspects between human and ape, focusing on their perspectives towards each other, and the apes' morale towards humans. This last point is what brings Dawn into smart, thought- provoking material. The relationship dynamics are complex, and not as black and white as you would expect them to be. Viewers can end up sympathizing and hating characters from both the humans' and the apes' sides, as there is a mutual connection and similarity drawn between the two.However, keep in mind that this is a distinct change from the previous movie. The first movie, was adventurous and curious in the sense you watched Caesar and others grow up in different environments (lab, suburbia, kennel) etc. all the way to the revolt. The tone was also much livelier. The new tone is darker, more serious, and relies on the drama more so than the energy spectacle of the first. However, at the last act of the movie, you will get the battle sequences you've been waiting for.If it's another thing for sure the apes are given the focus they deserve, you might even say they have MORE screen time than the humans!All in all, the technical dynamics are great, but could use more flair, more energy. 7.5/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The CGI was blended so very well. Andy Serkis (""Gollum"" from LOTR) was simply phenomenal as Cesar. It was a heartfelt (somewhat familiar) story of what happens when harmony is threatened by those who use deceit to achieve their personal goals and how that deceit can poison a culture. It is also a testament to love, loyalty and trust amongst, not only members of one ""culture"", but amongst those who strive to cross the lines between cultures that differ so wildly in the hopes of both living in peace and harmony.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
414,rawadk,"Brilliant, Amazing!! Sci-Fi at its best.",9,10 July 2014,"After Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I went in to see this movie with high expectations. All my expectations were exceeded. Every minute of the 120 were interesting. The story line keeps you wondering what will happen next and how will the war between apes and humans start. I found apes riding horses weird. But I guess this should be something normal in the movie since apes, like humans, were already speaking, building homes, and firing machine guns. The interesting plot twist was an ape deceiving his leader which started the war. At one point in the movie I thought it would happen but then as Ceasar exercised his leadership, I thought no one would dare deceive him.The apes' scenes talking to each other were great. They made them seem to interact with each other the same way humans do. Even the facial emotions. The facial emotions that were shown were just brilliant. The way the movie ends was also great. It makes you eagerly anticipate a sequel while thinking that for sure it will even be more amazing than this movie. This is a must see sci-fi movie that keeps you strapped to your seat and completely interested from the first till last minute.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
415,AnonymousCritic,Where did Foster go?,7,24 July 2014,"The first half of this film is a beautiful story of humanities place in the world, about why should stop fighting with each other, end all war, throw our guns in the lake and live in peace and cooperation. You marvel at the cast of ape who in spite of being unable to speak and using made up sign language portray some real emotion.The film slowly builds and build from an average film in to a great one, then from a great film into the possibility of being the best film you have ever seen, then for no reason at all of the apes learn to speak English overnight, despite many of them never seeing a human before, all of them pick up guns, and use them without any training, even those who were against using weapons and killing, and every female character is written out of the script. Without giving much away the second half of the film was beyond terrible.It had so much potential to discuss war, crime, prisoners of war camps, the meaning of life, but instead rewrote the script and million times, until you feel like you are watching a different film. Frankly, between edits they actually forgot several of the main characters, I still cant figure out what happened to the token black guy, I cant believe that the actors put up with it.Honestly, go and watch this film but as soon as you see Koba the bullet-proof ape, impervious to fire, charge a tank on his horse, throw whatever is left of your popcorn on the floor and leave thinking that you have just missed the end of an amazing film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
416,rhemie,Beautifully done!,7,21 July 2015,"That opening close-up shot of Caesar is just too epic! Then we pull back to reveal an entire army of chimps hanging off tree branches behind him - a promising start... until the hunting begins. I didn't like that sequence at all, it was a bit too animation-esque and doesn't look or feel real. And I still can't get over the idea of having the chimps on horseback with their short legs - the imagery was just too weird for me and a step too far.Those are, however, my only dislikes. Everything else: perfect! Absolutely brilliant! The very first time you see a human in the movie your heart stops. I was torn between two worlds. Do I side with the chimps or the humans? As the film progresses you constantly switching sides till eventually you on no one's side. Everyone has got very valid reasons for their actions and feelings (and some even scars). For that reason, there's no real villain in the film. Works for me - except we're left with a sad ending...Nevertheless, I was gripped from start to finish and would definitely see it again.

This one made me very disappointed; it's slow and it's not so much action or Sci-Fi as it is a slow drama interluded by some action scenes. There are a lot of scenes added that doesn't bring anything to the characters, or move the movie plot along. It would be wrong to call them ""darlings"" more like ""we need this movie to be really long so let's stay with this shot a few minutes more"", they clearly should have edited the movie more vigorously. For me this film was just another average drama, just like the Kardashian's, the only difference is that this time only half the cast are apes. It was a waste of time for me, they clearly missed the mark this time.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I myself thoroughly enjoyed this movie and cannot wait for the next installment to come out.The action scenes were amazing (I couldn't tell the CGI from the RL), the acting was top notch and the story made sense without any plot holes. Cesar is the star of the movie (Think Spanish Monkey version of Optimus Prime) and Koba the PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) monkey is his co-star. The humans are plot devices that need to be there, and they in no way steal the show. It's a film about a bunch of smart apes just trying to live their lives, and it's great.If you are a normal person who likes normal good movies, you will enjoy it (Unless you have Pithecophobia - Fear of monkeys).

I didn't think that the film would top Rise of the Apes and was wondering how it would compare to this already great year of films, such as Captain America 2 and X Men: DOFP. Gladly, it was better than them both. It was great to see Caesar's growth from the first film and how much of a leader he has now become. He has to make tough decisions but is still a great leader. I would have liked to see a bit more of the effects of the virus from the first movie but after a while, it doesn't matter as we can imagine what it must have been like. The acting was stronger, it was great to see how the apes had survived and the unity they have with each other.

421,samsoknite,"Good action. Cliché, but fun to watch.",6,15 July 2014,"Let me start off by saying I was never actually impressed with the first film at all. It seemed cut short and changed direction in a way that made very little sense. That being said, the second movie felt the same way. Now, as far as action movies go this has done a great job at that. I'm not going to say that this wasn't a fresh change in those regards but the script was terrible. The actors did a decently good job but everything felt like they just wrote in an excuse for certain shots and to decide an outcome that better represents the portrayal of Tim Burton's version. Anyone who assumes that these films are wrong and will differ from the others, don't forget that they literally made mention of Tim Burton's film with a news story and headline in the paper, that was in the first film, of course. So. This is supposed to be a prequel to Tim Burton's remake of the original. I assume the next one will be the last. With that said, let me go on to what I mean about terrible scripting. First off. The beginning of the film started with two apes who found their way in a tree-line and met up with a group of humans. One of them, was straight up over-the-top trigger-happy guy. As the film progresses this character seems to be the climax for just about /every/ conflict. It's one of the biggest action clichés. Of course, I wondered ""Why don't they just kick him out of their stupid group and let him stay home?"" Well, they said ""He's the only one who knows how the water dam works."" which you know what. That'd be all fine if he actually ends up doing something, which he doesn't. He just tells them they need to clear the debris and the rest of that segment the other group members do it on their own. So I am 100% certain that they just made that line to create an excuse for an unrealistically over-the-top trouble maker who can give the writers a thoughtless excuse to create tension. If you still don't think so we can go further up the line. They just took his word for it, they could've asked him not to cause trouble, because you know.. They said they'd kill them if not otherwise. Further on the movie portrays Garry Oldman's character as a bad guy near the end. ""I'm going to blow us all up because I tragically lost my family so now I'm senseless."" Where as the main character disagrees, threatens to shoot his friend he's known for how long and they built a town together, just to side with an entirely different species based on a few days. The Apes caused all the trouble in the first place despite that there seems to be recognition of this ""I'm sorry that we killed all you guys, but you can't stay in your homes now. Go away, humans. But we're cool, right?"" and that was the end.. Well no, wait. We saw a 10 second closeup of a CGI face, what a way to end an action film. Not like they could've ended it with a short portion of the only-spoken-of military entering the scene before credits roll. Moving back a few moments they just acquired guns, and all a sudden know exactly what rounds they need, and we see an ape on horseback dual- wielding two LMGs and their apparently special-ops skilled firearms tactics forced the high-ground humans to take cover IMMEDIATELY because obviously, despite having had guns for presumably years, it never mattered. All in all? In terms of writing, the story, and character arcs. This film was terrible at it and the director obviously had no shame in that. This was just a summer blockbuster that aimed to make money. It did just that. So , I give it 6/10 rather than a low-score. Because I enjoyed the action. It was fun, I don't regret watching it. It'd deserve a 7 if for not forcing me to pick it apart due to how insensible it was. Am I also the only person who felt like that one 20-year-old son could've not been in the film and nothing would've changed? Also, why is the main character okay that all his friends just got killed, including the innocent radio guy who didn't want to be there? I mean, like. Nothing made sense. It was almost as bad as when in Oblivion the girl was totally okay that her husband was just a fake copy , yet she'd giggled like a teenager who tried love for the first time. It was the same thing.

424,rikandum-205,The best 2014 movie I've seen so far.,10,12 August 2014,"The movie starts with a little explanation of what happened since the last one. It appears that 10 years later the apes managed to build their ""society"" in the wild. They've managed to breed, hunt, talk a little better and even ride horses. So, in 10 years the apes evolved and humanity was almost wiped out. Might seem a little too fast but it's definitely an interesting scenario. The story is actually quite simple, not as complex as I expected, but it leads the movie to a more elaborated conclusion. The way the apes turn against the humans was quite a surprise. There are several plot twists, which is great because it surprises the audience. The movie also comes with new characters and I think everybody played well, acting doesn't seem to be an issue. There were major improvements since 2011 as for the Visual Effects and CGI. The apes were very highly detailed, the fur in different environments looks really convincing, so did their eyes and basically everything. This movie proofs that CGI is getting really close to reality, and it will definitely leave a landmark in the VFX industry. Overall the movie was absolutely amazing, in my opinion, this is best 2014 movie I've seen so far. It is worth watching.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Most of the Directors are trying to show the dark and more realistic environment in the movies and MATT REEVES succeeded in it.It is a extremely well-made and enacted movie. What works is the intensity of the characters. Caesar is the character taken straight out of the last installment, Rise of the Planet of the apes. He is the brains and the brass together.

426,arvindsasikumar921,A Lesson for Michael Bay,8,10 July 2014,"After Transformers: Age of Extinction turned out to be a big disappointment (though no surprises there), I was really looking forward to this film and I was able to catch an advance screening of the movie yesterday. I am so glad that the entire cast and crew of this movie did an awesome job. Once again, Andy Serkis did a superb job voice acting as Caesar (and so did the other voice actors for the other apes) and I don't think anyone could have done it better. Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman did a good job too. Keri Russell didn't have much screen time but she did well for the time she was on screen. And I guess I don't have to mention the awesome graphics, though watching it in 3D didn't make much of a difference.This movie revolves around the lives of two species - the humans and the apes. The apes on one hand have progressed much in few years, they have started to read and write, establish laws, live together as a family, hunt together using weapons and tools and even domesticate animals under the leadership of Caesar. On the other hand, the virus which was being tested on the apes in the previous movie has actually caused an adverse effect on humans causing a world wide pandemic in which most of humanity has perished. Tensions build up between the apes and the humans which is the central plot of the story. What follows is a showcase of betrayal, trust, power, humanity and the basic need to survive.I would also like to compare this movie with the recent transformers movie (rather the entire transformers movie franchise). The transformers movies call themselves 'transformers' and they concentrate more on humans than the transformers themselves. This movie on the other hand focuses more on apes and at the same time also incorporates the humans and the tensions between the two races in a fantastic way. The transformers movies always have a half naked helpless chick running around the screen for god-knows-what reason and unnecessary emotional and romantic scenes. This movie kept every such aspect at the level it was supposed to be - no unnecessary emotions, romance or intimate scenes. What's more? I found the animation of this movie as good as (if not better than) the transformers movies. I could go on and on but I would end by putting this here: Michael Bay could really learn something from this movie.I would like to end by saying this is one of the very good movies so far this year. A must watch.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
427,richlong2569,Terrible popcorn movie,6,24 July 2014,"Well here we are again, another poor script and though plot was well executed and CGI was fine - they got what they wanted here, apes with machine guns on horses (it's in the trailer) I found this movie boring and not really in the spirit of the series. James Franco is missing from this movie, I wanted to see more Franco/Caesar dialogue the new cast are just one- dimensional fluff pieces, and completely forgettable. The first 30mins of this movie I found a complete yawn, I found it unlikely some plot devices actually happened (really? take an already violent human into the ape camp? why? does anyone know his name or what he brought to the group really?) and does Hollywood really think we're that stupid? I guess so.Compared to the original movies, with their confusing and complex plots, diverse characters (even though they were mostly apes), sub-plots abounding between religious caste and military caste not least to mention Charlton Heston's confusion about what planet he was even on - time travel movies or anything related to paradox is very hard to pull off, yet it was done with NO CGI and somewhat simplistic costumes (ground-breaking for it's time though).No, what we have here is a simply violent adaptation and I was sorely disappointed as a result. I found the story bad, the script poorly written with no meaningful characters on the human side of the equation - possibly the most important, Andy Serkis was strong - but no one else was. Gary Oldman was the lone human stand out - but one person cannot pull an entire movie from a bad beginning, unless your Tom Hanks and you're stuck on an island. For entertainment this movie earns 1 point, for CGI also 1 point and Andy Serkis performance again 1 point. The rest of it is complete garbage, ALL the starting characters we see (the first 30 minutes of the humans - the ones that visit the ape camp) are completely forgettable. 3/10. Pathetic really, this is all they can come up with 170m?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
428,acroking87,Superbly crafted cinema very few gaps,6,19 July 2014,"Had it been the first of the 'Planet of the apes' franchise of movies that i would have been seeing, I'd attach a whole another level of merit to the movie. There ARE of course a few areas where the movie shines up above the previous slices of time presented in this legacy of ape-drama. The apes have been lent a deeper sense of human emotion drawing lines of gray wickedness and a dark demeanor that imparts an almost human like hatred with which the anti-human arboreal Koba leads a vendetta against Caesar and his followers, while the prominent, principle-led flow makes Caesar, the Ape-tribe leader represent almost a human visionary. But then, that's just it. At the outset of a new episode in this saga rolling out, I had anticipated a multiplied level of evolution of the apes with a boost in intelligence beyond what has been showcased so far; after all, it's this evolutionary drama and the constantly evolving and developing ape community that made the planet of the apes series create a solid stir in the seventies. Though the alpha males of the ape colony were the trend-setters, the others remained the followers of the pack and at some point, the need for a few more characters was felt. The mighty and ever-thinking orangutan was such a pleasant character and demanded more to be seen in screen. While darkness prevailed as one of the most fascinating shades of the human-ape encounter, the literal dark treatment and absence of any clarity-rendering light induced a feel of dullness during several moments in the movie. The climax duel of Caesar vs Koba atop the debris of the construction site towers was a potential adrenaline booster. So was the familial sense attached to the Caesar family and the growing enmity which makes Koba fire through Caesar's chest and igniting a mob of revolutionaries from among the hitherto pacified apes. It IS a good movie. It however missed a few niche areas of scoring only a movie like this could have bagged. Let's hope the coming movie in this series does give you a whole shocker value delivering more than what the audience has witnessed so far.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
429,Kmark1293,Just another summer blockbuster containing strong visual effects along with average story telling and clichéd characters.,7,29 September 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, Gary Oldman, and Toby Kebbell in a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes that manages to make an improvement over the predecessor. Although it did not surpass my expectations for a good sequel, the action and character development kept me entertained throughout the film to leave a sense of satisfaction. However, like a lot of other blockbusters that came out in 2014, the hype for this film went way overboard. It is simply a good film, but nothing great or mind-blowing to write home about.First of all, the one thing that keeps this sequel from being exceptional is the average story. The story-line in this movie is really nothing to rave about as it is easy to predict where certain events are going to happen. Basically, when you've got a simple plot that doesn't add anything new or groundbreaking in terms of storytelling, it tends to bring the quality of the film down a notch. Also, certain plot holes come about that are never really answered throughout the story as well as the obvious use of exposition scattered within the dialogue.In terms of interesting characters, the main star of this blockbuster is the leader of these intelligent, ambitious apes, Caesar. His character has grown a significance of maturity since Rise and it definitely shows thanks once again to the astounding motion capture performance from Andy Serkis. Toby Kebbell's performance as Caesar's 2nd in command, Koba, is also a big standout showcasing his character's lust for vengeance against the humans. Pretty much, the apes are the stars of Dawn while the human characters are pushed to the side with the standout being Jason Clarke's Malcolm as the main human protagonist trying to push for peace.The one thing in this action-packed blockbuster that really deserves some praise is within the visual effects and cinematography. The top-notch C.G.I. effects from WETA are nothing short of excellence showing the fierce nature of the all the apes to life. On the other hand, the cinematography brings out the dark, dreary environment of an apocalyptic San Francisco. After seeing Dawn of the Sequel of the Reboot for the 2nd time, I've to the realization that this is just another typical summer blockbuster with a story that's told several times before. Despite having impressive visuals and two strong motion capture performances from Serkis and Kebbell, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes remains to be another over-hyped sequel that simply good, but not great. I still give this film a recommendation if you are so curious to check it out, but don't expect anything groundbreaking in return. Overall, I give this a 7 out of 10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
430,watchthisspacefilmmagazi,Ape-tastic!,8,14 December 2014,"This is a film I greatly anticipated having thoroughly enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and with the addition of one of my favourite actors, Gary Oldman, I was almost bursting with anticipation once again. Well OK, maybe not bursting otherwise I'd have seen it at the cinema, but close.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) picks up 10 years after its predecessor in a world ravaged by the disease. Humans are few in numbers and the apes have all but forgotten about them. That is until they stumble upon each other and exchange blows. The film then follows the apes and humans' attempted accommodation of each other. Needless to say, this doesn't last and a battle for survival ensues which threatens to wipe out both sides.RotPotA (Im just going to abbreviate now because, lets face it, I can keep typing the titles) was a film that set new heights for the franchise as it was the first one not to use men in ape costumes. DotPotA took the already frightening reality of the apes to a whole new level. The special effects used to create the apes is astonishing, there is no part of their being, their movement or actions that looks false.The opening shot is a close-up of Caesar's (Andy Serkis) eyes which was chilling to say the least. Although my favourite scene is when Caesar, after a long pause, shout GO! at the humans. Now that was utterly chilling, I mean I genuinely had goose bumps and actually rewound it to watch it again. Everything about that scene was immense.The effects are not solely to credit for the realism of Caesar, a huge amount of respect must be paid to Andy Serkis aka the real Caesar, who really brought this ape to life. His movements and mannerisms encapsulated an ape and really helped transform this CGI ape into a real character.One of the things I liked about the film was the empathy I felt for both side, the humans and the apes. Both caught in a war not of their choosing but having to fight it none the less. We saw more of the apes' side of the story but that is to be expected, yet it did not paint the humans in a bad light so finding myself rooting for both sides was something I don't often find myself doing.Overall I enjoyed the film, it did what it could with the story it had. We all know what happens in the end (refer to the title Planet of the Apes) and that the humans will eventually lose. That being said, director Matt Reeves gave us an enjoyable ride with some great characters, great action scenes and even greater effects. So all in all, good film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
431,Conradical19,"""As tense as the Sword of Democles""",9,11 August 2014,"Before I watched this film, I was dubious about whether or not it was a good idea since I had not seen the other films in their entirety apart from the original Planet of the Apes, starring Charlton Heston, a long time ago. I felt the trailer of Rise of the Planet of the Apes told me everything I needed to know about the first prequel. Perhaps I am wrong as I still haven't see that one but would love to now I have seen this one. I can tell you now that this film stands exceedingly well as an achievement on it's own. The prologue briefly gives context to this film and throughout it is easy-to-follow and a captivating experience. I was worried at the beginning that it was focusing too heavily on the apes since for the first 5 or 10 minutes after the prologue you don't see any people or hear any words. The apes use sign language to communicate which is subtitled but increasingly speak in English as the film progresses. Nevertheless, I think this provided the right approach because it encourages the audience to see things from the apes perspective rather than an exclusive human perspective against the apes. As Caesar the ape says to his son later in the film, ""the humans and apes are closer than I first thought."" The apes are given a lot of human qualities and thinking, which I think is greatly enhanced by the seamless CGI and the mesmerising performance of experienced actor, Andy Serkis as Caesar. Therefore, this film provides strong characters for the audience among both the humans and even the apes which we are able to empathise with. One of the reasons for this is because the apes have names and distinctive appearances too. Once these characters and the humans clash, it adds to the audience engagement.This film bears some strong political themes established by the character development. I observed four factions among the two species: The diplomatic humans, the diplomatic apes, the antagonistic humans and the antagonistic apes. These four factions can also be applied to the X-Men film franchise between the mutants and the human species. This enables civil disagreements within species that I did not expect. Much like the X-Men films, I believe even the antagonistic characters can be empathised with in this film such as Koba the ape when he points to his scars and quotes Caesar viciously explaining ""Human work""; or Gary Oldman's character, Dreyfus, when he looks at photos of his family who I assume perished as a result of the previous conflict. I wouldn't of first thought of this film as emotional but there is some emotional focus given to specific characters which give reasoning behind every character's agenda. Also, the character background perhaps initiated by the previous film Rise establishes conflicting perspectives across the characters. Despite Gary Oldman not having many scenes in this film, he is given enough scenes to establish him as a worthy character.This film is beautifully directed and skilfully paced. There is one particular camera shot I liked where it is fixed to a spinning tank and in this slow motion panoramic shot, you see the chaos unfold. This film is as tense as the Sword of Democles. The slightest wrong move made by any of the characters could have drastic consequences. These opportunities for disaster are positioned throughout the film making it an enthralling experience for the audience. The best thing was, most of the time, I honestly didn't know what was going to happen next! Since this is a prequel, I assumed I knew how this was going to end but the narrative played out very differently to how I expected, even the ending. Like with the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, we kind of know what's going to happen and there's this foreboding feeling that we know the bad guys have got to win to establish the connection between the prequels and the originals. However, I personally felt this film had a satisfying ending and certainly gives the impression that there will be another film to follow, which I was also not expecting!The soundtrack is also very good and adds intensity to the film. I especially love the creepy sporadic high notes to accompany the creepy human-like apes in some of the tracks that give this a homage to the originals. Also, check out the soundtrack and you'll notice cringey puns in most of the track titles!This film is certainly thought-provoking and had me thinking about it in awe for days. It does everything a film should do. It is unpredictable, visually spectacular, captivating, emotionally driven and a film that can be philosophised over; in this case, the politics of leadership and engaging in war. There is not really any humour at all in this film but it is excellent as an action/adventure/sci-fi film. It is not gory but has some violence and threat in it. Personally, I don't have any criticisms for this film. However, Mark Kermode raised a good reservation in his review of the film in saying that the female characters could have been stronger. Nevertheless my girlfriend, who is a passionate feminist, took me to see this film and she enjoyed it too and holds the film industry in high esteem for it. I am pleased to see that this series of prequels are not being made by Hollywood for the sake of making money (although I'm sure this is certainly a primary objective for reviving this classic franchise). Hollywood has exploited a great opportunity to explain the origins (as they have with other fictions) of the Planet of the Apes which were not previously explained and I am confident in saying that they have done the classic franchise justice by doing so. I am keen to see the other films now and I hope you are keen to see this one.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
432,tardieu-felix,Hail Caesar !,9,4 August 2014,"I wanted first of all to say that I absolutely loved this film.I waited impatiently, and hearing some critics about it, I thought I was going to be disappointed. However, this was not the case at all, which is why I would like to clarify some points.First, the criticism about weak dialogs are futile: the dialogs are not very developed, that's for sure, but after all, the entire film is about a community of apes just learning to speak and foremost to communicate, including gestures. Then you should not expect from them long speeches and rhetoric ! And about the humans, we must remember that their role is not central, they are not the heart of the analysis but instead they play more the role of a ratio (between man and animal, the reason and instinct), so that the weakness of their interactions is precisely encountered to highlight the progress of apes on men, such as newborns learning to speak for the first time. Thus, these critics seem to me unjustified. It is true that the script is not really worked in depth, however we do not get bored, and some twists are very enjoyable. It is unfair to talk about a lack of creativity in the script and about the ""hollywoodian"" side of it, because on the contrary the heart of the film lies in the aesthetic movement, feelings, ie in the implementation and perspective on every gesture of the apes, (as opposed to humans) every glance, every feeling, every outstretched hand. From this point of view, the film is wonderful, and thanks to the excellent harmony among the team of WETA, the special effects coordinators, specialists of mimicry and simian language, and the 15,000 people needed for the total production of the film. Some say they were annoyed or have found the film ridiculous. Of course, the film is built on a few conventional bases (the main plot, the twists and the final stand), however this is more than offset by the completion of the film, based on the analysis and research on the close relationship between ape and man, between reason and animality, mixed by the tumultuous relationship between Caesar and men, torn between love and distrust.In the end, the work is mastered, striking, and above all truthful about the heart of the film, that is the recognition of a species through the eyes of another.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
433,natebridgeman,Apes on horses! Apes with guns!,10,11 July 2014,"This film is not just the best film of the summer, it's probably so far the best movie of the year! These are the exact reasons why this film is great: 1.Amazing visual effects 2.Great storyline3.Awesome action (Apes on horses, apes with shotguns) 4.Great acting 5.Andy Serkis is probably the best motion capture actor ever. Overall the movie was just spectacular. My advice: don't expect anything when you go into this film. It is without a doubt the best entry in the planet of the apes franchise. Another thing about the special effects in the film, in Rise of the Planet of The Apes although that film had great special effects, there were some parts that you could tell were CGI while in Dawn, you couldn't tell if it was motion capture or CGI puppets. You literally feel like you are looking at apes. Anyways, the story is great, it had some awesome action, this film didn't disappoint me at all. So I will say that Dawn of The Planet of the Apes gets: 10/10 stars",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Mark Revees definitely knew what he's doing. the epic scenes were very well handled. it was emotional and well... epic. and most importantly, we are all saved from the lame, dumb, overly done humors. thank god.there were none that i dislike about it. but, somewhere around 45 minutes in, i got rather bored. they were just arguing. this is a very important part of the story, so they should have make it more exciting. but, there were still exciting parts slipped in though... one thing i hate is the cliché 'you were rained with bullets and survive without a scratch' kind of thing. come on, people, what are the odds? anyway, you should watch this...worth the money... awesome smart movie... if you like DOFP... this one is in the same level...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

However times moved on and now they feel very dated now so it took me a while to buy back into the franchise. Well a few weeks ago Rise of...was on TV so I gave it a watch. Guess what, I ended up really enjoying it. I like the dark undertones that have been added, bit like the Batman franchise. So I was ready to see this latest one and absolutely loved it. Great special effects again, and Andy Serkis as Caesar and Toby Kebbell as Koba are just brilliant. Gary Oldmans character is a bit vague, seems quite tame at first but completely changes later on.

It tackles so many contemporary and historical themes with any deftness and insight I didn't think was possible anymore.Race, colour, power, the human condition, love loss and revenge. The director matt reeves does an amazing job of bringing all these into an compelling narrative. And the performances of the apes....incredible.Watch it...its brilliant.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
438,RyeDough,Stunning,9,12 August 2014,"I have to say that when I saw the poster for the film (Caesar on a horse with a machine gun) I thought that this was going to be a full-on action movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't.Don't get me wrong, it has its fair share of action, but most of this only really kicks off in and around the middle to the end (much like the first film). Before that, however, comes a thought-provoking yet tension building introduction.It begins with a dramatic scene showing the virus spread across all of the Earth, and the slow escalation to panic (mostly words, very little action and no gore). A nice way to start, picking up where the last movie left off (except changing the colour of the virus- I believe it was yellow at the end of the last movie. Just saying).What follows are some tense and well-constructed scenes portraying the relations between the thriving apes and the desperate humans, and also the similarities between the 2. The humans are trying to get to a hydroelectric dam to power their safehouse to enable them to send a radio signal out to other parts of the Earth to meet up with other survivors. The problem is that it is on the apes' land. There is some yo-yoing between relations and some cooperation between the species, displaying their similarities. The waves of tension are genius. I will not go that far into them as I don't want to spoil it, but to summarise: relations deteriorate and you think war is coming, things improve and you realise it isn't, again and again. Brilliant stuff.Alas, war commences (which isn't a spoiler because it was clear already from the poster and the over-informative trailers). It does not, however, begin in the way you'd expect (oooh mystery). Of course the action sequences are watered down as it is a 12-rated film, but that does not stop them from being exhilarating. Ironically the action demonstrated another similarity between the 2 races- greed. Both spent part of the movie arguing over whether or not to kill the other race, and they ultimately end up attempting to do so (but again, not for the reason you would think ).This action continues until near the end, where the film closes with a not-really-extremely-happy-yet-at-the-same-time-not-really- sad ending.The characters are pretty good. There is just the right amount of background story in the main characters- enough to fill us in but at the same time not too much as it's not that important to find out an extensive background- where they grew up etc is not all that important.The acting is superb. Malcolm, the James Franco-like main character, fearful over starting a war and reverent towards the apes, is acted superbly. The supporting cast play their parts well also. I'm a huge Gary Oldman fan (who isn't), and I have to say he played his part very well- the war-hardened, grief-stricken leader of the survivors.The visuals are stunning. The apes are detailed, the apes' surroundings are beautiful and the humans' wreckage, well, it is a very nice wreckage. The action sequences are shot very well also.Faults? Maybe. I'm not sure why the apes didn't need to reload their guns (and I didn't see any extra ammo). Very little else apart from that. A fantastic movie, more proof that sequels (and remakes) can be every bit as good (if not better) as originals. Good stuff.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
439,Phoenixphire81,"Stunning, action packed and yet intelligent",8,18 July 2017,"A fantastic sequel to an already great reboot. The people behind these films have really done well to put new life into a dated series, while still holding high regard for their predecessors. Where the first film concentrates on the evolution of the apes and remained very intimate in tone, albeit building to something bigger by the end, 'Dawn..' takes an entirely different approach with an action packed but still very intelligent blockbuster. The effects are absolutely fantastic. There is a subtlety to the apes that works a treat. Not overdoing the human characteristics so as to become cartoon-like or cheesy, but also showing the significant changes in their behaviour as they gradually become more human. This is especially well done in Caesar and Koba. The visuals elsewhere are equally stunning with a demolished San Francisco done perfectly with a mix of CGI and effective set design. The first sequence, concerning a hunt in the woods is instantly riveting and you can't help at marvel at the fluidity of the action. This is also evident in some later sequences as the inevitable war breaks out (well..we all know how its gonna end). The human cast do well in their various roles with nothing too taxing expected of them. Slightly more significant roles from Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke are performed with conviction and you can genuinely get behind either of their goals (whichever one you may choose). Maximum praise should be given to Andy Serkis once again. His understanding and grasp of motion capture, and his ability to give such incredible performances, while in the guise of all manner of creatures, continues to impress and astound. He is able to give such raw emotional depth to Caesar as a character that he is almost human. Which I suppose is the point. On the other hand, his total immersion into the animal side of Caesar, with his movement and body language, reminds you that you are still watching a chimp. The line is balanced perfectly and Serkis is fully in command. His performance is believable and completely committed. Credit is also due to Toby Kebbell as the man behind Koba. I really enjoyed the entire experience of watching this film. It was dark and tense in parts, touching at times and the action was visceral and exciting. There are some beautiful shots throughout with real world effects and CGI so seamless that at times, you cannot actually tell them apart. Can't wait to see where they take this franchise...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
440,movieboy13,"Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is the most intelligent, mature, and phenomenal film you will see that features chimps with machine guns riding horses",8,12 July 2014,"Wow. There have been several times that I loved the first film in a series, waited a few years for the sequel, disliked, and then forgot about it. This is not the case. Although I personal like Rise of The Planet of The Apes a bit better, this movie is close second. It's excellent. Not just as a summer movie. Not just as a sequel. But as a film. It is an incredible movie. Also what it does is so unique, it not only makes you care about both sides of a battle, but it gives a whole new outlook on the war that began it all in the Planet of The Apes trilogy.This movie really avoids a lot of clichés. A few inevitable ones pop up, but it is really quite unique. The acting on the ""human"" side is decent. The characters are not incredibly developed, but they don't have to be. They have enough development and are not annoying. You care about their situation. Gary Oldman has a surprisingly small role, but a pretty good one. But the real star is obviously the apes. Andy Serkis and the team of motion capture actors are mesmerizing. The effects are great. The movie also has a lot to say about the human condition. I won't ruin that.The movie also had a lot of moments that really made me care and it was quite unpredictableI cannot think of another case of a series that was rebooted three times and on the third time got it right. TWICE!!!! I was worried when a friend told me the movie was clichéd and stupid...it is not so. Even if you are excited for this movie, it will still exceed expeditions.

441,rocketrider231,Three Years of Build-Up Does More Than Payoff,10,13 July 2014,"When Rise of the Planet of the Apes first came out in 2011, I was surprised by how good it was. It was so good that it made it in my top 3 favorite movies of 2011, and it's even one of my favorite movies in general. I had been anticipating the sequel ever since 2011, so I had been following the movie from the very beginning. When Matt Reeves was cast to direct, I got excited, as he had directed Cloverfield a few years prior (which is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time).Today when I finally sat in the theater for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I didn't know what to expect. Some of the thoughts whizzing through my mind included: ""Will it be as good as the first?"", ""Will it be disappointing?"", ""Will it be amazing?"", ""Will it be terrible?"", ""Will I be able to take the apes seriously?"". When the opening logos came on, I braced myself, hoping that it would be good. Two hours later, I walked out of the theater with my eyes and mouth wide open, completely mesmerized by what I had just seen. Was it good? Oh yes. It was GREAT.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up a couple of years after it's predecessor. Speaking of it's predecessor, there are several connections to the first movie. Because of this, I strongly recommend seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes before seeing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (not only because it's important to the second, but because it's a great movie). But if you see the sequel without seeing the first, you'll probably be able to fill in all the blanks. In the first act, I was surprised by how much I actually got into the apes and their storyline. When I noticed this, I began to worry that it would be an imbalanced story with more of the focus/sympathizing shifted towards the apes. However, in the second act, any and all worries of this were dismissed. The humans are equally as interesting as the apes and are just as worthy of being rooted for. The best way I can describe how I felt about the two sides in a sentence: in the first act I was rooting for the apes, in the second act I was rooting for the humans, and in the last act I was rooting for both.The acting in this movie is very well-done too. Something I noticed was that each of the different apes have different personalities and traits, rather than all of them having the same traits. The actors playing the humans are just as great and slip right into their roles. The acting with the apes and the humans are all excellent.The plot of the film and the way how plot points are executed is incredible. Things happened that legitimately shocked me. The plot went places that I never would guess it would. Not to mention, the action in this movie is just flat out AWESOME. Everything is there, from the edge of your seat fight scenes to the white-knuckling tension. In addition to all this, not only is Dawn of the Planet of the Apes directed and acted well, but it's also rather high on the emotional factor too. I haven't cried in any movie this year (including The Fault In Our Stars), but during Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I'm not gonna lie, I teared up a bit.Prior to seeing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I thought that X-Men: Days of Future Past was the best movie of 2014 thus far. However, after seeing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, I have to say that the two are tied for the title. Three years of build-up and anticipation DEFINITELY pays off. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets a 10/10 from me. Easily as good as (if not better than) its predecessor. Do yourself a favor and see it. It's definitely worth it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I don't have much to say about the movie right now since I don't have any question to answer about any particular subject of the movie, but let me tell you that this is one of the rare cinema experiences that will forever change your vision of the cinema and what we can do with it. This is not just a movie, it's a real, true masterpiece.If Matt Reeves, by any chance, reads this review, I want him to know that it really amazed me and that he is a pure genius, with a great talent that I am impatient to see being used again in the sequels of this movie and his other projects!In other words, don't think too much if yes or no you should watch this movie, the answer is definitely yes!

And this trend also started stimulating a craze in movie field. Whatever in Godzilla, Transformers-4 or this film, you can evidently see the weak side of humans. Due to modern development, industrialization and information revolution, this planet has been deeply ravaged. Many animals inevitably faced the extinction of their races. Do ""home"" and""Family"" only belong to humans? Don't you think that is of great selfishness? For all peoples, it is seemingly impossible to strike a balance between human interests and wild creatures' protection. The future is still bleak, consequence depends on our hands.

With a name like ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" you already know that the apes win against humanity in the end. It's just a matter of how. Instead, it's a smaller story about a tribe of newly-intelligent apes near San Francisco whose first contact with humanity is an accidental encounter followed by a failed quest for peace between the two sides. As it turns out, the future ape leaders of the world are mostly peace-loving and, despite a few bad eggs, want nothing to do with fighting humanity. But through an unlucky turn of events, one of those bad-apes assassinates the ape leader and blames it on humans. Thus, the apes go to war and quickly roll over the human settlement despite the humans' overwhelming military advantage.The ape war and end of humanity is catalyzed by accidents followed by betrayal, lies, and gross military incompetence. No one can do anything right. It is an unsatisfying story whose main characteristic is its multitude of blunders. I consider the mistake riddled plot to be lazy story-telling. It would have been more challenging to tell a believable story of apes unifying and beating a better human foe, but that story would have been more entertaining.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I was waiting for something to hold my interest but there just didn't seem to be even that. There were four groups of individuals, good humans (who like monkey people) bad humans (who hate monkey people) good monkeys (who tolerate humans) and bad monkeys (who hate humans)and that was about it. Good cgi I guess and lots of mock anger and angst from all parties involved oh, and shooty shooty bang bangs but what was the story - what was the point of it.

This movie isn't just the best Planet of the Apes it is a great film.I went into this filming thinking I was knowing how it was going to end, but it was still able to surprise me and give me an experience of a great story. We know that we are leading up to a Planet of the Apes world at one point, but it didn't end the way I thought it was going to. The story is just really well done.The performances also kept me engage. Andy Serkis is just spectacular as Caesar. He has this atmosphere about him. He is one of my favorite protagonists, because you get to feel for him as a person even though he is an ape and his character is like a human. He grew up as a human and that also causes some discussion. He deserves an Oscar nomination for best actor for this performance.Toby Kebbell is just scary as Koba and I was just utterly shocked by what was going on with his character. He was just incredible. Jason Clarke was also really good as Malcolm. His role is better acted and written that James Franco's, but is also given a lot of depth with the parallels drawn between him and Caesar. You also have Gary Oldman as Dreyfus who is a villain in the film. He was a character that had a lot more depth than I thought he was going to and his character takes turns that I didn't think were going to happen.I think the most brilliant thing about this film is how well the CGI is mixed in with actual people. You can tell that someone worked hard on this film and the apes actually feel real even though you know they aren't. It might be digital make up, but it is really good digital make up.The direction is also well done because their are so many interesting shots in this film that give it such a great atmosphere and create this really full world. It also makes it even more interesting. Matt Reeves did a great job and I personally enjoyed the beginning news reel clips because it takes the end of the first film and gives it even more dimension.Everyone felt like real people and that was helped by the excellent writing. I thought that the writing was outstanding and gives each characters clear motivations without bashing them in the head. Every line means something and nothing seems out of place of the story.This film is breathtaking. It is refreshing to see a story told not always in words, but in sign language allowing the words and physical presence of the characters affect us and not their speech. The acting is stupendous and creates characters that have clear motivation that makes sense and makes it story not about the humans trying to survive, but about the apes trying to survive. Excellent film making with amazing directing. I am giving this film a 3.75 out of 4.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
448,ayush000054,"A smart, involving sequel, Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar",9,15 December 2014,"Much darker than ""Rise,"" ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" rises and falls on the large shoulders of Andy Serkis. He gives Caesar a quiet dignity and, if possible, almost makes him human in his emotions. He does not want war, even when those around him insist on it. Serkis conveys more with his eyes than many actors do with their words. From the anger or betrayal to the joy of holding his newborn son, Caesar is the strongest and best drawn out character in the film. Serkis is joined by other actors who also bring out the emotions under their computer generated fur. Kebbell is angry and bitter as Koba while Karin Konoval, as the gentle orangutan Maurice (a nice nod to the late Maurice Evans, who appeared in the original 1968 film), is kind and caring. On the human side, Clarke and Keri Russell do well as the leaders of the observation group, as does Kodi Smit-McPhee, as a young man who spends his time sketching his new simian friends. Oldman is a little over the top in his distrust of the furry fellows. Perhaps someone told him that Hollywood is actually a town run by apes. The time is now. While the genetically evolved apes from the first film, led by Caesar (Serkis, in what should be an Oscar winning performance) occupy the woods mankind, overwhelmed by the ravages of disease now lives in camps that were one time major cities. We find such a group of survivors in what used to be San Francisco. While on an exploration mission outside the city, a group of humans come across two young apes. A standoff occurs, broken when one of the group panics and fires his gun. The ape is only wounded but the shot of the gun brings out a shrewdness of apes (yes, dear readers, if you want to impress your friends tell them that a group of apes is referred to as a ""shrewdness), led by Caesar. Caesar still remembers the kindness he received from some humans and brokers a peace between the two factions. This does not sit well with Koba (Toby Kebbell), a fellow ape who longs to battle. He will soon get his wish. Visually the film is outstanding. The apes and their world are rendered well as is the inner workings of what is left of the city of San Francisco. As for the 3Donce again it brought nothing to the film but a lot of blurry images in the foreground. I honestly think the process needs to be saved for animated films, where it seems to work the best.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
449,ralph_valkenburgh,Dawn of the end of the franchise...?,6,28 November 2014,"I want to precede this by saying that I absolutely loved, ""Rise of the planet of the apes"". Certainly in my top 30 of all time.Dawn of the planet of the apes, unfortunately, won't be in my top 100 movies of all time. The CGI was done superbly, but that is the mainstream nowadays. I mean, for that matter I could like all of Marvel's monstrosities. It was nice to see Ceasar again, and how the rest of his primate friends developed to be smarter than your average Homo Sapiens. But it just didn't cut it for me. The entire feel of the first reboot of the franchise was left out. Obviously, this was due to the rewrite of the script. Thanks to, who's name shall not be filed, oh wait, he actually wanted credit for that?I wish I could describe to its entirety what went wrong with this one, but that's impossible considering the mistakes they made. I can however, tell generally where they went wrong. That means I have to describe what went so well with the first one. Which was emotion, the overall progress of the story, the development of the characters, twists, and undeniable clichés which are human to its core. You admire them, you hate them. The characters became your friends, and your enemies, and at the end of the movie it left you with a raw feeling of happiness and sadness at the same time. It left you longing for more, and it told you that (in the sense of how good the next one ought to be) to those who wait, good will come. WRONG. Everything I just said about the preceding title ""Rise of the planet of the apes"" was EXCLUDED in ""Dawn of the planet of the apes"". In fact, I just watched the movie with a grin accompanied by a frown, not knowing what to make of it. I finished it purely because I so enjoyed the preceding title, and had this feeling of having to know what will happen next. Apes with guns, OK, it had to come to that. But seriously? Just a handful? Just a handful of people too? And of course, just Americans. What about the rest of the world? It wasn't just the USA that was struck. It was the entire world, right? No, but of course the only remaining live humans are from America, which not to forget, is ground zero. I also want to add, what about the rest of the apes that should have gotten their doze/infection, as the virus is airborne. Maybe the idea for the next movie? War for the planet of the apes? They should have given some fundamentals to what is going on, on planet Earth. This was just a sad excuse of a sequel. Not worth the time, or the money. Don't watch it alone (too boring).

Firstly, the story. I thought there was nothing terribly wrong with the story, nor anything too implausible (given the basic set-up), but it was just so, so reminiscent of any number of blockbusters that I've seen over the years. Just so interchangeable. The message that Apes & Humans are alike in their moral spectrum was, in true Hollywood style, hit on the head with a sledgehammer and then reinforced several times over.Characters. A fine cast, but there was so little that was distinctive or memorable about characters from either species' cast - again, so stock. Gary Oldman felt wasted in here and looked and acted exactly like he did in Batman.Special Effects - they were impressive. But the modern blockbuster (starting perhaps with 'The Dark Knight'), seems to overstay its welcome with spectacle overkill and if you're like me, you'll do just about anything to avoid sitting through another prolonged action sequence, unless you're fifteen years old.91%...really?

The characters aren't very interesting (though the actors play them very well), the apes are stunningly rendered but equally stunningly one-dimensional in personality, the story is so predictable as to be laughable and, in the end, it turns into a tension-free, suspense-free, popcorn-munching wait until the violence starts (and ends, since there's no real interest or depth there, either).Very, very disappointing, especially given all the hype and hope for a great continuation of the series. Popcorn fodder, little else.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

This is the best ""planet of apes"" movies to the date. All the action, drama and Caesar's heroic character had me excited on the edge of my seat. This movie should have at least been nominated for Oscar. The movie truly depicts flaws in human nature, and also warns that ""ebola"" was preplanned. The cast of the movie is also amazing and I hope the next part also includes them. Thanks for the fun writers and direction, although the movie could have been even more trail-blazing. But, lets expect that from the next part.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
453,Justin765,Not just a Summer Blockbuster,9,11 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes occurs a decade after the events of the first film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and follows a band of survivors of who have endured a deadly viral outbreak. It chronicles the relationship between the human survivors and a group of genetically modified apes led by Caesar. Through the evolution of the narrative events occur that leave the human survivors and the apes on the brink of war. The cast includes Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, and the wonderful returning Andy Serkis as Caesar. The acting is in all regard good, but where it truly shines is in the scenes where Clarke's character is interacting with Caesar. The chemistry between the two leads is compelling, thrilling, and aw inspiring. Particularly due to Andy Serkin's phenomenal video capture work. Gary Oldman is also fantastic, (per usual) and no actor's presence seems to detract from the film. Director Matt Reeves is one of the undeniable factors that makes 'Dawn' so great. Reeves direction is smart, intuitive, and filled with dozens of engaging shots. Reeves hits the mark with almost every frame and this greatly affects the overall intensity and emotion of the film. The screenplay is also admirable for creating memorable dialogue even if some of it fells like exposition. 'Dawn' also exceeds in exhibiting interesting social commentary throughout. The film presents themes of racial tension in intellectual ways and this is greatly appreciated due to the much-needed depth it adds. These social messages help to create a great deal social relevancy propelling the film past just great Si-Fi. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves over its predecessor in almost every way. From the stellar direction to the social commentary, 'Dawn"" exceeds the summer blockbuster template to construct a film that is truly relevant while also being extremely entertaining.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

456,swp_1988,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes transcends the Hollywood blockbuster. Rich, beautiful and haunting filmmaking.",9,10 July 2014,"Sequels can be a worry when coming from big studios. Greedy cash-ins are all too familiar, where rather than stepping further into the world established by the predecessor and exploring unlimited opportunities in character and themes, they just add more antagonists, more action and more noise. It can also be worrying when the original director who helped see a great film through till the end is replaced in the next film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a refreshing and involving take on an old franchise and director Rupert Wyatt set up such promise for its sequel. Matt Reeves takes over the reins here on Dawn...and thankfully has taking the film to a rare, brilliant new level.The film is set ten years after the first film. The ALZ-113 virus has continued to evolve Apes. Led by Caesar, they have made their home in the woods and bred. On the other side of the island (and the world), humans are scarce. The virus has had the opposite effect and spread, killing billions. Those thousands we do see remaining are struggling to survive. When an unfortunate situation occurs between the two sides, war is imminent. But not all humans and Apes agree with the potentially devastating results.Whereas Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a stripped back study of the science at the core of the story, whilst investing us in the human drama, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes throws us head first into a very different world. The scope is immense and multi-layered. At one view, it's a dead, frightening post-apocalyptic world. At another, it's brisk, dynamic and visually arresting. Matt Reeves has such a masterful handle on every string and creates brooding scope, claustrophobic tension and powerful action sequences; all amongst a basic, but incredibly rich morality play which is raw and powerfully spoken. What is most fantastic about the character approach is nothing is clear cut. Good vs. Bad meet in the middle and spirals out to both sides. I could sit here and blabber about the complete awe I had of the major step up in visual effects of the Apes, but that's not what caught my attention. Right from the opening scene of an extreme close-up of Caesars eyes, I felt the characters. The performances from all stunt men and actors bringing life to these apes transcend the visual brilliance. It is collective. It is immersive. It is terrifying. Andy Serkis delivers one of his most satisfying performances to date. His dedication and his understanding of every thread and fiber of Caesars being are in every frame of this film. And I cannot forget to mention the all-out, aggressive performance from Toby Kebbell as Koba. He breaks the barrier of something quite terrifying and strong.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes transcends the Hollywood blockbuster. Not only does it deliver that rare sequel explores its world and characters further, but it's also richly told, beautifully and hauntingly portrayed and truly exciting and terrifying in equal measures. Quite possibly one of the best films of 2014.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
457,TBoSH-TDK,Amazing film! The definition of a good summer Blockbuster!,10,3 August 2014,"Remember when we had those big-budget summer blockbusters that worked as both entertainment and genius filmmaking? It seems like 2014 does; so far we've had X-Men: Days of Future Past, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Edge of Tomorrow, and of course, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.With storytelling that can only be found in the most thought-provoking of science fiction films, Dawn takes the intriguing concept introduced in the 1963 book and pushes it ten levels forward. It's ironic how a premise that sounds silly can become one of the darkest, most serious films of the year. So we start the film with apes and the humans who survived the Simian Flu (introduced in the last film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) living (relatively speaking) in peace, and we see Andy Serkis playing one of the most compelling, complex, and powerful characters in recent cinema history, Caesar, having a wife, a son (and a new one just being born), and leading the community of apes, which does in fact have peaceful lives, until the humans sort of get inside of their territory, where a lot of conflict begins.The performance capture is by far the best I've seen; not only Andy Serkis gives a great performance, but Toby Kebbell, who plays Koba (Caesar's second-in-command), is intimidating and scene-stealing, as one of the most memorable sci-fi villains I've seen. The rest of the apes are mostly silent, but Blue Eyes (Caesar's son) and Maurice (Bornean orangutan and Caesar's friend and adviser) do get moments to shine.The action scenes are as dazzling and exciting as 'apes on horses with machine guns' sounds, if not more; however, the action is basically a plus, for those who need to see action on the screen to be entertained. In fact, around 45 minutes in there was a short action scene and I realized there had not been any action scene since the opening 5 minutes, which wasn't a very long one, either. The second act is very action-packed, but it works, because the first one built up to it perfectly and it absolutely delivers. The third act has a great final confrontation between Caesar and Koba, whose rivalry has, again, been built up since the first act.It has a lot of themes that we saw in other movies earlier this year (particularly X-Men: DOFP and How to Train your Dragon 2), the most fascinating of which is, of course, the possibility of two races co- existing and how that can break the human spirit and corrupt. There is also a lot of 'does the end justify the means?' on this movie, and if you've seen it I don't even need to mention it. There's prejudice as well (also dealt with in the films previously mentioned). The social commentary is something I absolutely did not see coming; the film deals with this... empathy, I believe is the word, where Caesar, who has been with both humans and apes, is forced to decide ''Well, what's better for my species and what's better for the humans?'', and that's where I think it kind of hits with the country leaders and how they sometimes act out of desperation or without thinking on how it may affect the other side, because we see, and it's obvious that it's just the same in real life, that not all humans are bad, but contrasting that , not all apes are good. I believe this film will probably cause a lot of controversy, but it's in The Dark Knight sense of the word, where it opens the eyes of a lot of people to seeing stuff that they hadn't noticed before or simply ignored. I don't want to get even stronger in this of the social commentary, but I think it also deals with how sometimes the leaders do in fact take the choices right for everybody but there's that one guy who disagrees (and the way Koba is written you can see where he's coming from-again, just like in real life, hopefully- ) and does what he thinks is right. Every action has a consequence, even those that we may think are not important or relevant, they all affect us, our surroundings and the way we live.I have a reservation about the film and it's one that seems to be a constant with both this and Rise: The Human Element. We see what happens from the human perspective, yes, but the characters as a whole could be slightly more compelling and memorable. I was surprised by how much I remembered them after leaving the cinema, but they're not multi-layered real people-esque characters (ironically, the apes are), but they still work well since we also see where they're coming from. It's a very little problem, and it did not affect me while watching the movie, it didn't strike me until after doing so.This is a film that is sure to make you leave the theater thinking; the ending is a well-executed cliffhanger for sure, and as high as my expectations were, the movie did not disappoint. There's good characters with splendid performances particularly from the apes' side, a smart script, action that serves the narrative, the score is good (though not as memorable as the film as a whole), and overall I believe this is one of the better films of 2014. I highly recommend it. 9.75/10 (but since there's no .75 here I'll give it a 10).",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
458,amit-garg270,The greatest Apes movie ever- BLOCKBUSTER,10,17 July 2014,"This is by far the greatest Apes movie ever in the history of modern cinema. I could hardly recall the plot of the previous edition of the Planet of the Apes movie franchise (2011), but it all mattered nothing once this movie started.The mere display of Caesar portraying a powerful and ferocious character leading an army of apes gave me goosebumps. And from that instant, I was literally on the edge of my seat. Showcasing brilliant minds of their own, apes make you scream for more. The apes running on horses was the scene to watch. The apes territory made me wanting to be a part of it. It was like a trip into the jungle/wilderness. The 3D effects adding to the charm. Excellent cinematography by Michael Seresin.The battle between humans and apes envisages. Both want to act peacefully. But the situation they are in, you are made to believe that all humans are not alike. And apes can only 'ape' humans, they can't be Humans in actuality. Superb performance from the lead actor Jason Clarke in trying to bridge a gap between humans and apes, beautifully supported by his family. And Koba, the Bonobo who hates humans for his mistreatment, plays his part very well by being the main antagonist.The story is the main highlight of this edition. Full marks to Matt Reeves for scripting a beautiful picture. You are constantly involved in the movie. It is dark. Realistic. It makes you think. It makes you worried. Makes you laugh at times as well. An absolute thriller.In the end, I can only say one thing, you are not going to watch this movie just one time. Your heart will plead with you to watch it again. So, its not to be missed.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
459,CinephileDundee,A near flawless film,9,17 July 2014,"WOW....yeah, okay, I concur, every positive thing that has been said about ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is completely true....amazing cinema considering the dreck that is also on offer, IE another Bay film....Almost flawless, WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!I say almost because there was one completely ridiculous and unnecessary scene that took me completely out of a movie about talking apes, do you get what I am saying, ha???? In fact, this movie would have gotten the perfect score if some of the human elements that made either no sense or meant nothing to the plot were cut in the editing room. Let's just say this (SPOILER ALERT, kind of?), if your biological father has been dating someone for what could be as long as 10 years, and you don't know that she had a daughter who died from Simian flu, then you have some serious communication problems....and are probably a douche-bag....that scene really needed to be cut big time....The one other thing that bugged me was the lack of acknowledgment of the ""missing"" astronauts from the first film, which was obviously put in there to eventually tie in with the original film. Recently the director remarked about how this is a whole new world and they don't have to go in that direction. That's all well and good but you clearly alluded to this scenario happening in the first film so you can't just come out and say ""we don't have to go in that direction."" For the one thing I truly hate is when there is a lack of continuity....But overall, this film is pretty much the only thing worth going to see at this present time. Saddens me to think that this, a great film with great effects masterfully told with actual heart and intelligence will make nowhere near the amount that Transformers, THE most banal, insulting franchises in any genre of all time (and I was a Transformers nerd back in the day) will.Can't blame the Chinese really, it is their first Hollywood blockbuster to some extent....but when it comes to the rest of you, what is your excuse?

Of how easily diplomacy can spiral out of control and spark racial unrest. A very thought provoking update to the franchise that makes it absolutely 100% relevant to today. Sci-fi at its best!

461,azzthom,Humans V Apes - Round 2. This time it's bigger.,9,25 July 2014,"What we have here is a continuation of the latest attempt to reboot the 'Planet of the Apes' franchise. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' continues, and builds on, the story that started in 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. And does so very successfully. The story takes place 10 years after 'Rise' and the Apes have built a home for themselves near San Francisco. They are living happily together still led by Caesar and blissfully unaware that Humans are not as gone as they think...From a technical standpoint, 'Dawn' is an improvement on 'Rise' - and 'Rise' was pretty excellent in that regard - with better CGI, better use of motion capture and more ambitious set-pieces. The inevitable battle scene is spectacular without ever seeming out of scale to the rest of the film and the Apes, which are far greater in number than in 'Rise', are handled seamlessly. Most of the Ape characters are returning from 'Rise' including Rocket, Maurice, Cornelia, Koba and, of course, Caesar. The human characters are all new and it is the relative lack of development with them that is one of the film's few shortcomings. The narrative is simple, but stronger for it, covering a few themes and a short timescale before setting up the next film in the franchise.In short, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is a worthy, and possibly superior, sequel to 'Rise'.

If you can stand 3D this movie makes good use of it during the action scenes. The story is about war and how sometimes conflicts are inevitable. Even the bad guys have reasonable motivations.

There was over reliance on cartoonish action scenes.I loved the very first Planet of the Apes.. over 40 years ago. It had both social and psychological reveals. How ape-like human society is.. and how humanity has failed. The present film series coat-tails on the popularity and success of the first one. This film has no new reveals or insights except for shallow clichés.Some of the poorly expressed themes. There are good apes and bad apes, there are good humans and bad ones.

465,awesomeness0232,They did it again,9,12 July 2014,"I love the original Planet of the Apes movies. When Rise of the Planet of the Apes came out a few years ago, my reaction was basically, ""Great, another crappy attempt to reboot the franchise"". I couldn't have been more wrong then, as that film was a very good prequel. But Dawn of the Planet of the Apes totally trumped it. First of all, for those who get excited for movies with cool action and great special effects, this one hit it out of the park. The apes were incredible, and the battle scenes were outstandingly done. It was exciting to watch and felt incredibly real. However, I'm not usually one to go for the big special effects movie. I typically get more excited for a deep plot and interesting characters. Well guess what, they hit that too. And the amazing thing was that the most fascinating characters in the movie were the apes who had little verbal dialogue. Sure, they spoke with some sign language but it was still fascinating to watch these creatures come to life before my eyes as real characters with real intellect and emotions. The apes develop and evolve intellectual throughout the film in such an amazing human way. All in all, a really well done film. I enjoyed every moment and will definitely watch it again when it comes out. I hope that they make another. The only thing I'm still searching for in these movies is that I am excited to see them bridge the gap between this series and the original films.

466,mikeinator24,Shakespeare level of story telling *minimal spoilers*,8,10 July 2014,"The best in the series. Dawn takes a tremendous look on humanity and our way of life. It is great to see and hear how the apes live in a mirror image of early humanity. One man says, ""They don't need electricity or warmth, which is what makes them stronger."" Throughout the movie there are more parallels to an ape and human life, Caesar's family versus the family of Malcolm (the human protagonist). Malcolm sees so much of him self in Caesar that eventually betrays the humans to help Caesar. This wins over the viewers hearts more thoroughly to side with the apes.Other than that the characters have fascinating relationships with one another, resonating a Shakespearey feel. Especially with Caesar (ironically named) is leader of the Ape republic and has almost absolute loyalty of his followers other than Kabo, whom seeks to overthrow Caesar, and is constantly undermining him and acting behind Caesar's back. Which gives us the sense of Brutus in the story of Julius Caesar. And there is again another relation to Hamlet. For Caesar's son is constantly living in the shadow of his superior king father. He starts of shy and obedient but we see his struggle of changing as Kabo establishes more followers, and his choice whether or not to stay loyal to his father.There are much more great characters in this, along with overall superb story telling. On top of the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the front of the line of CG technology, which assist in the awe of the movie and make way for incredible action scenes. I hope this movie gets as much credit as it deserves.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

That, and a metascore of 88 on the first day, naturally, I expected a masterpiece. But what i saw was just awful. The first few scenes have no dialogues, it's all sign language, with a bit of monkey sound here and there(60% of the film, actually). That puts you to sleep right away. There are no awe inspiring scenes, not one frame of amazing graphics. The ""emotions"", well, didn't work for me.Story? Okay. Humans want to repair a dam nearby so that they can get electricity, Caesar allows them to work, and asks other monkeys to help. Meanwhile, mean monkey Koba goes to Human place and sees a bunch of weapons. So, it comes back, attempts to kill Caesar and then starts a war with the humans. Climax?

468,maxcobain,Possibly the most disappointing film of the year.,6,18 July 2014,"At least with this year's 'Godzilla', I went into it expecting a clichéd action movie, but with 'Dawn', the series has,(rightfully or not is a different question), gained a reputation as being able to balance thoughtful reflection with enjoyment, and so I was looking for it to transcend traditional tropes of the genre. But it didn't.However hard the film tries to convince you of its intelligence, its an average action flick. The storyline is bland, an unbelievably predictable, relying on caricatures, not characters, to provide the conflict both within the human and ape species and between them. A corny script, filled with forced sympathy and unconvincing moments of bonding, that results in characters we don't really care for, most notably, and worryingly, the main human character.So why have I given what is clearly a very flawed film a 6? If I dislike it that much why not give it lower? My rating is completely based on the brilliance of the CGI, which provides breathtaking realism to the encounters between simians and humans, and brings to life the main action scene, complete with horse-riding monkeys wielding machine guns. At points you forget that Andy Serkis' Caesar is, well, Andy Serkis, and the technical achievements of the films special effects make it more enjoyable than the story deserves.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The CGI - Yes it's amazing, the CGI roles have more character than the human actors, which says a lot, very very poor performance from the human element of the film, and almost laughable extras and support roles.The film is full of clichés and is unbelievably predictable... sometimes I can deal with predictable if the film is tense, and gripping, but this is the first time in my cinema life I have ever closed my eyes and rested my head, waiting for the inevitable to happen.

Nevertheless, when Andy Serkis was cast in the first film, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" I became confident the film had a strong potential to breathe new life into the series. The first installment, contrary to everyone's thoughts before its release, turned out to be a great opener to the new series, as it was deeply emotional and character-driven, while Andy Serkis' motion capture performance as ""Caesar"" gave his his character a genuine human aspect that audiences sympathized with and cared about. The sequel, titled, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", is just as much a surprise as the first installment. Let me start with the visual effects. They are, in a word, incredible. Motion Capture continues to improve over the years, and what you see in this film is without a doubt the best you've seen to date. WETA, the visual effects department co-founded by Peter Jackson and the winner of 5 Academy Awards (LOTR trilogy, King Kong, and Avatar) outdoes themselves in this film. The Apes look incredibly realistic, even more so than in the first film only 3 years ago. Thanks to motion capture, you get the emotional expression of the actor penetrate the CGI and touch the audience in a unique and incredibly intimate way. You FEEL the hardship and inner struggles of these well-drawn, unique characters. As mentioned earlier, Andy Serkis gives another Oscar-worthy performance as ""Caesar"", but Toby Kebbel, who plays the emotionally and physically scared ape, ""Koba"" gives him a run for his money. Despite his actions, the audience feels for this character and has a great understanding of the motivations behind what he does in the film. He is a truly menacing and terrifying antagonist and one of the best I've seen on the big screen in quite a while. Besides having well-written characters, the parallels and connections the screenplay weaves between the apes and humans is incredibly well-crafted. These are two very different species who really want the same thing for each other---peace, safety, and prosperity. Though they are different physically, by the end of the film the audience comes full circle and realizes just how similar the apes and humans really are. This gradual realization is done in a smart and engaging way, and Caesar's discovery of this is touching and relevant to the viewer. The film also goes deep into and explores the evolving society of the apes, the hierarchy that exists, education system, and inner struggles with Caesar, his family, and his relationship with Koba. It's not as allegorical as the original 1968 film, but nonetheless it examines the hardships of a new society that juxtapose the human side. Moving on to the technical areas, the direction by Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Cloverfield) is very smooth and smartly executed. This being my first Reeves film, I was very impressed. The cinematography of the film is beautiful---the apes colony being visually striking as well as the worn down, dilapidated San Francisco. Also, although being a 150 minute exercise, the film has very good pacing and has few dull moments (the only dull moments come with the human characters). The only weak spot in this film is the human characters. They pale in comparison to the apes and aren't as well drawn-out or unique. Furthermore, the writing between the characters isn't top notch by a long shot. Fortunately, they don't get as much screen time as the apes and it turns out to be a weakness that is overcome by the film's end. In conclusion, Matt Reeves' ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a superior entry in the Apes franchise and is one of those extremely rare sequels that greatly improves upon its predecessor. It will certainly be a tough act to follow, but with Serkis already signed on for the next entry, and (hopefully) Reeves returning to direct, I'm already excited for what's in store.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
477,apr-407-799961,This is SCI-FI Drama not SCI-FI Action,6,12 July 2014,"I have not seen so many characters cry in one movie .Ceasar was shedding tears every now and then , later his son was also inconsolable ,why all of a sudden gary oldman cried I couldn't figure out ,the other lead human family did their bit too.The movie had some good moments but every time the fun was hijacked by emotion which was oozing out of characters uncontrollably .The special effects were good as expected from a movie of this kind of budget , and the last act was very much predictable .Also never during the movie could you tell yourself you are watching a summer blockbuster , it had a common intensity level from the start which didn't decline but neither did it peaked.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
478,CannonballJoe,Movie of the year!,10,13 July 2014,"This summer has featured some pretty spectacular films, but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes outshines every one of them. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole 2 hours. The action is fun, the characters (humans and apes alike) are well- developed, cool soundtrack, and the 3D fits perfectly. And the CGI effects have vastly improved. My god, technology is incredible-there are scenes where I have a tough time figuring out whether it's real, or it's digital. There are two characters who easily stand out: Caesar, and Koba. If you don't remember, Caesar is the main ape from the last movie who shared that relationship with James Franco, and now he is the ruler of all the apes. And Koba, who was the badly scarred-up ape who was tested a lot from the previous movie, is now Caesar's trusted adversary. In this film, Caesar is all about peace between ape and human kind, but Koba despises all humans. This leads to the story playing out very interesting...plus, there is a plot twist that I did not see coming that really changed the movie. In all of this, I don't think I have a real big gripe...or a little one. I really thought about it for a while, and I can't think of anything I disliked at all. This might not be the MOST accurate review, but it's just my opinion, and my opinion is that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is movie of the year. So far...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
479,teaparty_man,What the heck movie were some people watching,3,13 July 2014,"First, a 3 is what I give the movie only for the special effects. Compared to the CGI in older flix like the Matrix, in many cases you could almost believe they were real apes running around with guns.As for the story?? O...M...G...!! When the people started applauding at the end, I wanted to stand up and shout what the H-E double hockey sticks. The plot is simply unbelievable. For 10 years, humans are hold up in San Fran proper....with fuel..but no electricity. Uh?? No one thought to take a drive to the Ace hardware to get a generator? Yes a drive cuz they got trucks and jeeps and even an assault vehicle that FEMA left behind..oh and mountains of guns, but not one generator? What about private homes...?? NO ONE had a back up gen, or the office buildings they were living around in?But I digress..first they want to show that the monkeys all live this idyllic life on the other side of the bridge, complete with JUNGLE SOUNDS YOU WOULD NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITH A MOVIE SET IN Africa!! UuuuuHHH??!? A group of dumb humans are wandering through monkeyville when they run across the monkeys and a trigger happy loser shoots and WOUNDS a monkey. So in order to show they are not monkey killing savages, the humans lower their guns and say sorry, we won't do it again. Wait if you are so humane and caring and none threatening, wouldn't you want to offer to help the wounded monkey, pull the bullet, patch him up? Nope, just leave and NEVR INQUIRE AGAIN about the wounded monkey boy.This is just the beginning of the absurd and ridiculous plot and it's twists and turns. Another incident...We're told the monkeys did rampage and kill many humans along with the ""simian"" Flu. This has been the environment for 10 years. And no electricity either so the two losers who are supposed to be guarding the munition dump, probably never saw ""Bedtime for Bonzo"", would not be entertained so easily by the circus like antics of bad monkey. Who of course dupes them into a false sense of security, to the point of the humans offering the monkey whiskey, which monkey spits in their faces, so he can get their gun and mow them down.This only 2 of many holes, loops, twists, turns, that make no sense, add nothing to the plot, which is as predictable as the sun coming up in the morning.And of course, Hollywood recycles an old story, because they have no imagination, no originality. Proof, that as a society we are truly circling the drain. I say we give up now, turn it over to the monkeys so we won't be subjected to this sort of dreck again.Sigh.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
480,pmcanenny,What Battle for the Planet of the Apes should have been.,9,22 December 2016,"This movie is the best sequel I have seen in a long time!When Rise of the Planet of the Apes was released in 2011 it surprised critics and fans alike with its new style and approach to Planet of the Apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes it one step further.Matt Reeves direction is a welcome fresh perspective and he mixes the emotional drama and edge of your seat action sequences very well.Andy Serkis as always is fantastic and makes his take on Caesar believable and you feel for his character. But the one who really steals the show is Toby Kebbell playing Koba, his character is at times really quite scary! The battle scenes are really great and take Planet of the Apes to a new high, but with all the action you don't lose the heart warming drama that made the previous instalment so successful, Caesar is really struggling to maintain a balance between the humans and apes. It's not just the apes though, Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman both put in sterling performances, and although the pace of this film is a lot faster than all previous apes films I find it works well.The CGI apes are again extremely realistic but the effects don't overcast the performances as is common in so main high profile big budget movies. If Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a remake of Conquest, then this is a remake of Battle that far exceeds the source material. This movie is definitely worth watching, and is on par with the original 1968 Planet of the Apes despite being a very different type of film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
481,connork97,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,8,4 August 2014,"When I saw the original Planet of the apes, I felt it made a strong statement on where we are as a civilized world. The film allowed us to look at ourselves from an outside perspective, and see our successions and mistakes from the point of view of an ""alien"" viewer. It doesn't degrade us or applaud us it just says here we are, what do you think.Now in the very well done prequel in 2011 we can stand back and unlike the other Plant of the Apes films we can view the films hero Caesar as our outside ""alien"" but with the added benefit of him living in a place that is ""alien"" to him and not to us. In Tim Burtons version and the original our protagonist was human in an unfamiliar world, but in an all to well familiar society. So this new ability allows us to sympathies with an ape rather then a human, and look at the modern day world from Caesars outside perspective.Since this film is a prequel we know it is moving slowly towards its predecessors, and we begin to notice it in Dawn of the Plant of the Apes (what a duzy of a title). The story begins a little after the last one ended. Most of the modern world (from what we can see) is gone, assuming because of the deadly virus that shows no affects on apes except for an extreme increase in intelligence. And as we see in most apocalyptic setting in Hollywood there are survivors, and they live in the ruins of San Francisco. On the other side of ""pond"", in the redwood is where Caesar has built a growing and thriving empire. It has many of the same characteristics of some of man's early empires, and the apes wield many familiar weapons. The conflict arises when the humans must fix a power dam to regenerate the city electricity, but the dam is located within the apes boarders. Caesar negotiates a deal to allow humans within the boarder to fix the dam, understanding the humans need it too live. Now we see that both society's feel fear and can view the risk to there livelihood and well being. It is at this time we begin to notice our similarities to the apes. In a time of great risk comes large decisions which is ensued by politics, greed, corruption and a lust for absolute power. This all blends with the panic and hysteria of the citizens to create a portrait how a general war begins.This is an extremely entertaining film which properly works through the characters ability to grip you with emotion and suspense, while keeping an underlying theme all the way through. It is a true blockbuster that knows how to properly mix an investment on characters, story and beautiful CGI that compliments the film greatly.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
482,feelingchimpy,A Beautiful Tragedy.,10,23 February 2016,"I went into Dawn super excited to see the story of Caesar continued, and I was not disappointed.Dawn is a very different movie from Rise and I often find it very difficult to determine which I like more. I like different aspects of both films. They've become tied for my favorite movie, period.If Rise was emotional, Dawn was a roller-coaster. No single movie has brought tears to my eyes during so many different scenes. I haven't become so invested in characters in a movie for a long time, you can't watch it without feeling something for them. Most of that was due to the acting, especially in the ape characters. The performances were incredible, especially after you've seen behind the scene clips to strip down and see the actors themselves and how much they put into their roles, emotionally and physically. Some of what they express is so subtle but so powerful, and that is the movie's biggest strength. Without such amazing performances from the ape actors, Dawn wouldn't be half the film that it is. Weta really stepped up their hyper realism game as well, the apes look so real that I swear I could reach out and touch them. There was no point where I thought to myself ""That's CGI"", unlike Rise, where there were a couple brief moments. In Dawn, we see more ape characters developed than just Caesar as with Rise. I enjoyed getting to know more apes and its not a stretch to say many of them are very likable, or at the very least understandable in their motives. Its great to see how the apes as a whole have developed, the society they've created for themselves, and the forming of their culture. I could have watched an entire film, easily, focusing purely on the apes without any humans involved at all. The only complaint I have about Dawn is that I wish we could have been shown more of their way of life, not just the beginning sequences before humans show up and everything starts to turn upside down. In many ways, the beginning was a show of what could have been but was not to be, and in that lies the tragedy of what did end up happening. The ending has such a sense of hopelessness that its painful.This is the apes' story. And man, is it a story that I can't wait for more of. I can't recommend these movies enough.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
483,swiss422,"Pretty monkeys, pointless plot",5,12 July 2014,"Yes, a cinematic triumph. We can do anything now. The apes are photoreal and expressive, and they show sheer genius of the movie makers.But I have to fly in the face of all the folks trumpeting how this is a classic, it's breathtaking filmmaking that transcends typical blockbusters and on and on. The story is concocted by filmmakers eager to set up a big violent battle because it'll be SO COOL and audiences want it. But it makes so little sense and is so implausible I was literally laughing in the theater (the only humor in this film is unintentional; you're supposed to only be awed, angered and upset.)I mean honestly, five people are given three days to resurrect a dam that's been sitting there for ten years, without equipment, support, or as far as I can make out, even a voltmeter. It's taken a whole crew of street maintenance guys two months just to put in a traffic light in my neighborhood (and they've got power tools and can order spare parts from Grainger), but we expect these five (apparently only one who has ever seen a dam before) can pull something like this off in three days. And of course that dam's right in monkey harm way, prompting the battles. They couldn't find some other way to make power in San Francisco? Distill methanol from all the biomass, or use a wind turbine -- the Bay Area's brimming with wind turbines, they're on every hill -- or solar panels? No, it HAS to be the monkey dam, because otherwise there'd be no basis for monkey battles. And why do they supposedly need electricity? Because they have to power their radio to see if anyone else is around on the planet. Couldn't they plug it in to one of the cars they're driving around all over the place? How much power does a radio take? Obviously, at least a dam's worth. I'm sorry, I'm sitting there asked to believe such ridiculous things because everyone says it in such somber, menacing tones, but it's obviously all concocted just to force a big epic ape battle. And frankly, after Transformers and X Men and all the rest of the summer bash, we REALLY need another pointless epic battle.It'll make a ton of money because people really like going to see things get destroyed, and they'll have fun watching apes set up as sympathetic heroes so they can get gunned down. And pseudo-intellectuals will treat it like great art because the monkeys were all so GOOD and humans are so BAD. Bah. It's like playing with toy soldiers, and as uplifting.Enjoy!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
484,naughtydogproductions,A masterpiece and an astonishing film.,10,25 July 2014,"-SPOILERS-This film was better than Rise in many different ways. Films that have sequels are mostly hated and are truly rubbish! For example: Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen, that film was funny but lacked the power that the first Transformers had, most of the films did. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes had another director but was powerful in action and story, Rise had the same power but something in Dawn had it. Apes riding on horses made an exceptional ""WOW"" from people but only once scene in Rise had the Apes on Horses. Koba was more of a character in it as in Rise he was a lonely, saddening ape...Caeser's son(Blue Eyes) wasn't a big character but was indeed in it for a long period of the film first appearing at a Bear Hunt with Caeser. Cornelia is actually the proud wife of Caeser and Queen of the Apes and I'm saying of every Ape in the world...Cornelia is later shown sick and the sad thing is Caeser seriously throws his wife in a river to protect her from Fire, but she doesn't die. Its unknown what shes dying from but I may not have been focusing much...Caeser is also getting another son, unknown name...sadly...I call him 'Raven' the film calls him 'Caesers Infant' not his real name by the way, he doesn't know anything yet since his JUST born...I have to say the films CGI was magnificent and the acting superb, AWESOME ACTION (98% MORE THAN RISE) and OMG...the motion capture was well done.

485,jhanson769,Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a visually stunning and emotionally enthralling sequel.,7,11 July 2014,"Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes, superbly directed by Matt Reeves and starring Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, Gary Oldman and Andy Serkis is the sequel to the 2011 Planet of the Apes reboot, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Rise is a stellar film- it pushed the bounds of motion capture technology and breathed fresh air into a near-dead franchise. It was a new story that did not follow the path it was expected and presented an interesting look into the history of the mythology of the films. Despite all this, it does fall short in some areas, but one of which is not the human characters. James Franco's Will is very fleshed out and essential to the plot. Unfortunately, this is where Dawn falls short. There are very nice moments with Malcom and his new family, but they just feel one dimensional. That's not to say I did not root for them and care for their relationship with the apes, however. They just felt plain. The actors did a fine job with their material, but it wasn't much to go on. Some characters were even just there to be there, since we need a big apocalypse group. But, for there ape counterparts, there is more to say. Andy Serkis, obviously, does a fantastic job. All of the mo-cap actors made me believe I was watching super-intelligent apes. Their mannerisms are spot-on. The directing is stellar- Matt Reeves is able to elevate his material and present a tense atmosphere. There are several jaw-dropping shots and great ape VFX. All in all, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is a film worth seeing for the apes alone. You feel as if you are with them, watching their primitive community and seeing their amazing interactions. But if you like big action, you will also find yourself at home with Dawn.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The movie direction achieves a perfect balance of emotion, action and betrayal. Never thought Koba of all would play a vital role. The character development is aced there too. Other actors do a decent job of keeping the audience on edge. But the screen time given to the apes is what keeps the movie going at a great pace.

487,accelerius,Arguably the best film of the summer,9,18 July 2014,"Any film which makes you think about it after seeing it is a film worth the time. Dawn Of Planet Of The Apes is one of the best films in recent times to accomplish that simple but difficult task of making the human brain think and in that process to change. The film succeeds where the older installments (barring the 1968 Schaffner part) failed. It makes us feel for the apes as much as we feel for a human...perhaps more. To achieve this is no mere task and Matt Reeves pulled it off.The film opens 10 years after the previous installment. Much like Battle for the planet of the apes opened 12 years after Conquest. And Ceasar is the king of the apes as was established at the end of Rise. As the film goes darker, we go deeper into the human condition. The action never feels unnecessary and overdone. It is marvelously executed. The apes show more soul in this film than most of the humans. And the storyline is smooth and never drags with its 2 hours runtime. The editing and direction is precise technically and the special effects are brilliant. The real stars are the cgi effects. Never before have apes seemed so real that you will think that they used real apes to film the scenes. The score is dark and exciting. The acting is acceptable from most of the cast.The best part of the entire film is Andy Serkis whose motion capture acting is perfect. He showcases the journey of Ceasar in this film with confidence in the entire film and is the one character who makes everyone on and off the screen hush and listen and watch with anticipation every time he appears. The Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is arguably the best film of the summer as it has all the elements of a blockbuster as well as of a thinking man's film. It showed that there can be darkness in light but also a light in every darkness.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

This is quite possibly one of THE greatest films I have ever seen. It is a huge improvement from the already amazing first film. Caesar has to be one of my favourite fictional characters now. Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of him. There is enough action, emotion and epic special effects to keep anyone amused. The whole thing was just so perfectly put together. I really wouldn't be surprised if this wins Best Picture at next years Academy Awards. Whether your into sci-fi/action or not, this will not disappoint you. I strongly urge everyone to go and see this film. Trust me, its worth it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
489,liam_ragan,Half and half,8,17 February 2015,"I have an entirely mixed opinion on this movie. The CGI made me forget that what I was watching wasn't real monkeys, and some of the parallels that are drawn between the humanity of the apes versus the inhumanity of the people was really thought provoking. That being said, aside from the above mentioned idea and a few tribal thrills you get from watching the apes evolve, the storyline seemed quite bland and unoriginal.Another thing I liked about this movie was the way they showed human problems in the context of a paleolithic style society of apes. I don't want to give away too much, but for those of you who enjoy a movie which is able to go deeper than surface value, this one might do it for you.I had huge expectations coming into this, which may account for my disappointment, because the movies not awful, but it's also not the sci-fi phenomenon I was hoping for. I'd love to have seen the human society as a whole have wrestled with the humanity of the apes a bit more than they did, and it seems to me like a few too many characters remained unchanged throughout the movie, but overall, it was a fun watch, and I'd recommend it to anyone with a few hours to burn. 7/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

491,PeterKorcek,Solid Sequel,7,23 July 2014,"As with many other titles, even Dawn could not run from cliché obstacles that every sequel of a successful movie faces upon its release. When first ""new generation Apes movie"" came out, it was a surprise blockbuster and it did very well in box office, so obviously lot of effort was put into making a sequel that would be as thrilling and dramatic as the first installment.The sequel did a good job overall, personally to me it had interesting atmosphere (grim, rainy forests, war-torn human city) and it was fun watching how both sides (humans x simians) interact with each other from the beginning towards the end - phasing from complete rejection to glimmer of possible mutual understanding and finally ending in all-against-all butchery where apes riding horses and wielding submachine guns thunder over humans.The star of the movie was of course Caesar, who I liked very much already in the first movie. Played brilliantly by Andy Serkis it is figure so powerful and deep that you will care for him the most apart from the other actors who did OK job. Caesar was really the highlight of the piece and I would watch the movie again mainly for the the deepness of the expression and emotions Mr. Serkis put into displaying the leader of the Apes.To conclude, Apes 2 is a movie worth watching, probably just once for most of us, but I definitely do not cry over money spent to see this film. In fact, Im looking forward to the final chapter of this series.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
492,siva_sanjeev-798-161832,Good fences make good neighbors,10,11 July 2014,"Robert Frost once said, 'Good fences make good neighbors'. I really don't know if you can understand the implications of this adage from his poem 'The Mending Wall'. So, where do we draw that line or the fence? And how well do we respect that territorial pact? How will our preconceived notions give rise to conflicts and lead us to tearing apart our neighbors? Humans have gone way beyond the Darwin's survival of the fittest theory. Our existential crisis seems to have consumed us so much that we are always war torn; at conflict. Dawn of planet of apes is a glimpse of the beast within ourselves; a mirror to our deeds in the past and the present. It is a brilliant tale of obvious conflict between humans and apes. ""But, why? And for what?"" catapult this movie to the next level of storytelling.Riding on the wave of success of the sleeper hit and the acclaimed 'Rise of planet of apes', 'Dawn of planet of apes' is not just your average CGI or a sci-fi popcorn flick. Coupled with an excellent story lineup and brilliant CGI and motion capture work, and some excellent acting (from Andy Serkiks, Toby Kebbell and Doc Shaw for their mind-blowing ape-like performances – the motion capture work), this is by far the best movie of the 'planet of apes' installment; all in all, one of the very good movies I have watched in the recent times. Just imagine a set of apes capable of emoting happiness, sadness, anger, rage and so on; unseen and unheard of.Now, the titles make lots of sense to me, at least. 'Rise of planet of apes' shows how a group of apes evolve into intelligent beings, speak and think like humans do, and how the simian virus spreads across the globe infecting the entire mankind. 'Dawn of the planet of apes' starts from where the infection kills millions (ever played Plague inc. on Android/IOS?). A small set of humans, who must have either fought the virus or evaded the virus, are living off the coast of San Francisco and that's when the movie is set.As the title suggests, it is the 'dawn' of something at brink. What is 'it'? Which of 'em is going to emerge as the dominant species on this planet? What are the choices they (both apes and humans) make and what are the consequences of these choices? More than often, we do not see movies that have a soul. The soul of the movie lies in the characterization of apes and humans. One minute you feel one of 'em is right and in the very next, you see that the other is right too.The movie will shock you with its unexpected twists. I was spellbound and baffled with occasional bouts of goose bumps during certain sequences, for I never expected that coming. Watch the movie for its breath-taking imagery, for the apes that emote and for the primeval question, 'How did 'it' start?' A highly recommended film. My rating 5/5.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
493,Movie-Mate,Dawn of an New Era,10,16 August 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes surprised the hell out of me! Not because i did not expect a good movie. I read the reviews and they were all great. But every once i a while a movie comes along, so strong, that it manages to surpass even great expectations.I should properly say that i am not the biggest PotA Fan to begin with. I really like the original and was pleasantly surprised by Rise. But Dawn plays in a totally different league. Everything about this movie is to notch. From the screenplay, Direction, Acting, Score, Cinematography, Lighting, Editing and of course the Effects. But when you say the effects in this movie are great, it still feels like a major understatement. When it comes to the (e)motion capture effects, we are talking Avatar level! The effects are absolutely 100% Photorealistic. They are so good, that 10 minutes into the movie you stop being amazed by the effect and just recognize them as characters. I thing that is the ultimate goal any effect should try to achieve! The Actors, Humans and Apes, all do great jobs here. But special mention most go to Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell who play Ceaar and Koba. They both bring unbelievable presence, strength, honor and in Kobas case threat to there parts. The Film itself is paced very well and does not have a doll moment. Yet the director is confident enough to not rush to the scenes. He gives the characters and settings time to breath. The world they build is very atmospheric and believable. The film also has many memorable scenes many of them with little or no dialog. The actors often working with gestures and there eyes. Which is especially fascinating when you realize that every performance has to by made twice. Once by the Actor and once by the visual effects Artist. And make no mistake, Artists they are! The movie, though great in scope and spectacle has little in common with the average summer Blockbuster. It is not a fun Action adventure. There is serious emotion and drama to be found here. And even though there are a couple of great Action set-pieces, it is often the small quiet moment that managed to move me the most. There were several Moments and the Film when i had bleary eyes. And i don't tear up that easily! One of these Moments was the absolute great and in my opinion very brace Ending. Powerful, powerful Stuff!They are already working on the next Apes Movie which should come out in 2016. If they can contain that level of quality, i am really looking forward to where the story leads next.

Apart from that this movie has got THE BEST CGI I have seen in years, forget AVatar or Hobbit (Definitely an upcoming Oscar for that). Every bit of hair and wrinkle on the ape's body is clearly visible and perfectly synchronized with it's movements. Besides that the storyline is good,can't say perfect,but good. It seems to work and is not embarrassingly stupid,with God's Grace.Definitely a must watch.You won't be disappointed.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
495,ax105,About as Much Fun as Picking Lice out of a Monkey,3,17 July 2014,"This is my honest opinion, the truth and nothing but the truth-Let me start by saying that I have watched thousands upon thousands of films. Everything from 80's action to modern independent to foreign horror. As is expected when watching so many movies, one is bound to come about a stinker every now and then.Of those stinkers, this is by far one of the worst. Now to clarify, it is not even a ""so-bad-it's-good"" type of affair either. No, my friends, this film lacks almost anything resembling entertainment.From the get go we are treated to a 15 minute or so bout of the apes hunting, gathering food, and generally living in their ape city. It feels like an hour. Not a good sign. Furthermore, for the duration of this sequence, the apes communicate solely through sign language and bright yellow subtitles. Yikes.After being treated to this sub-par excuse of a National Geographic documentary, I contemplated doing something I had never done before, walking out of the theater and spending the time elsewhere.In hindsight I wish I had.The rest of the film follows suit with card-board stiff acting from the humans, living up to each and every cliché imaginable as these characters that you don't care about in the slightest go about their business.Yawn. This goes on for what feels like is another five hours or so (the pacing is devastatingly slow throughout) and nothing much at all happens. It was if the filmmakers took the absolute worst parts of Jurassic Park and threw them into one elongated middle section.Later in the film, without spoiling anything that isn't shown in the trailers (which do show just about everything), there are several battle sequences. These scenes can hardly be called action sequences, as without any attachment to the characters paired with the absolute absurdity (a 120 pound ape carrying a 50 pound SAW machine gun in each hand, charging into battle balanced on a horse), they are less riveting than playing a casual game of Angry Birds while sitting on the john.Just don't see this film.Even if you were a fan of Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Instead watch one of the films that this movie tried to be- Rise of the Planet of the Apes, District 13, or Jurassic Park.Actually, just watch anything that isn't this train wreck.3 bananas out of 10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets to be exciting and to say something about the world instead of merely blowing it up. The apes are among the more intellectually complex characters you're likely to spend time with in movie. Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar Nomination for his fantastic portrayal of Caesar. This movie will make you cross every finger and toe you have in hopes that both the apes and humans can co-exist. A well deserved 9/10 !!!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes in basically every way. The CGI and Motion Capture is much better in Dawn then it was in Rise, and Rise had some impressive visual effects. The Apes in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes are so well realized, that there are some scenes in this movie that convince you that there are real apes on the screen, not just because of the incredible CGI, and the fact that this movie is directed beautifully by Matt Reeves, but also because the actors portraying the apes do such a great job of acting like apes in their motion capture work, especially Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also has a very gripping story, and very good acting, not just by the actors playing apes, but the actors playing humans as well. Definitely one of my favorite movies this year, of the ones I have seen, if not my favorite.

499,stigcaptian,Dawn of the Planet of the Hits,9,30 December 2014,"Let's face it. Technology is amazing. Nowhere is this exemplified more then in Rise/Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. These films use state of the art motion capture tech to make Apes characters. Caesar has grown up since the last film. He is now a leader. Some of the old cast of Apes return. The Apes believe that Humans are wiped out. When Humans and Apes meet there is a moment of confusion and conflict. As the conflict escalates the dark sides of the characters are revealed. Andy Serkis leads a parade of excellent performances as Caesar. Toby Kebbel does an admirable job as main ape villain Koba. Gary Oldman is a little too anti-Ape as Dreyfuss. Jason Clarke is soulful as Human scientist Malcom. Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee are underused in what could have been pivotal roles. Overall and excellent action packed film with soulful characters and amazing world building. Thank you for reading, good bye.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
500,Crumpackersam,Meh......,5,20 July 2014,"First let me get this one thing out of the way, the effects are good. However, nothing stands out with this horrendous movie. The human characters have no personalities at all. Malcolm is supposed to be sort of the leader, aside from Gary Oldman who doesn't do anything. Which is another point this film downplays Gary Oldman. Gary is a terrific actor, and to only have him hang around their sorta HQ the entire time and then dabble I don't know five minutes worth of action is a real insult. But meh his character is bad too. It's also weird because he seems like he is going to play a huge role when he first hits the screen, he is active and involved and then poof he is gone for half of the movie. I guess they might have been focusing on the apes, but the message of the film is harmony and balance between humans and apes, so I guess that doesn't also apply to equivalent amounts of character development. The apes were pretty cool though especially Maurice. Caesar was freaking cool, and Kabo was perfect in his role. The ape base was also pretty well done good looking. On top of all of this, there are some serious plot holes that I'm not even going to mention that they are so obvious. I honestly don't get all of the attention this movie is getting. Top 250? Look what American cinema has become,",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
501,brandoncharlesworth,Perfection.,10,28 July 2014,"I loved Rise, along with a lot of other people, so I was really excited for the sequel. The only thing I wanted was for it to be better than Rise, however I remained skeptical as there was a new director. Was this better than Rise? With out a doubt, 100% yes. The CG is incredible and a massive improvement over its predecessor, even though there was nothing wrong with it in the first place. Matt Reeves is a confident and excellent director as he constantly does a close-up on the apes faces. He also manages to make the apes extremely human and you really connect and feel for them. The human actors and characters were good, especially Gary Oldman. Andy Serkis is phenomenal and deserves at least an Oscar nomination. The story always takes unexpected twists and turns which made the movie unique and the action is probably the best we've seen this year. I don't think it is better than Edge of Tomorrow but didn't do anything to annoy me, and that's why I score Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a 10 out of 10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
502,stevenwhitehead3,Rise...and Rise again **may contain spoilers**,10,21 July 2014,"After seeing this on release date, I had to take a few days to let the movie ""sink in""....let it develop It picks up pretty much hot off the heels of the first movie. In that it allows the viewer to be reminded of the simian flu, its world wide spread and its devastation, to the economy, the government, mankind and all that goes with it....as far as the viewer is concerned - the globe is decimated by this virus.....Then it all kicks in! I reminded myself of how Rise of the planet of the apes brought us the real beginnings, of Ceasar and his followers, of the James Franco character and how the virus began. Rise was a real masterpiece in the making, great story, staggering effects.Dawn takes this to a whole new level, heart, depth, unbelievably good special effectsThe time and effort spent on getting San Francisco, the red wood forest, the country to look ravaged, deteriorated and completely desolate over its time span is eerie...the effects team deserve huge credit for this...not a single pixel is ignored.The human characters are well brought together, its just a shame that the plot is too intense to allow for more character development in some of the people....that is my only negative to this film.I just sat back and completely revelled in the wizardry and wonder of the effects, the action....the apes. You can easily forget that the apes are CGI, they are THAT good...If you thought Rise was good in the CGI department - Dawn simply Rises...and rises again!!Koba and all the ape characters, Maurice, Bright eyes and the others are wonderful on screen, their communication and the depth of them all is just awesome to watch.I never believed I could feel emotion towards a CGI character, but because they are THAT believable, you feel their pains, their struggles... and it is a credit to the film that it pays off.GREAT film, worth seeing for the action scenes, the depth of the characters, the pains they go through, the effects, I could go onI hope that a 3rd in this franchise is being produced - to really drive this Apes saga forward.Go see it....",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
503,robot560,"Couldn't said any better of this, Deb",1,11 July 2014,"The movie was incredibly long, boring, and repetitive. And it couldn't have been more uninteresting. Despite the fact that this movie is heavily marketed to kids, it's also extremely bloody and violent, with the apes throwing another ape off a balcony, and you are treated to a loud splat!. Then, there are the apes machine-gunning humans to death. But, still, we are told that the apes are the good guys who are just responding after the humans invaded and killed an innocent ape boy. I felt like I was watching CNN coverage of the ""innocent"" HAMAS Palestinians weeping over their dead boys while nobody gave a crap or remembered the three Israeli Jewish teens who were kidnapped and murdered for no reason.The movie takes place ten years or so after the first ""reboot"" of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (read my review), which I didn't think was all that great, but is a masterpiece compared to this. A virus has wiped out most of the human race, and there is no electric power. Humans live in one area (and most of civilization is overgrown and abandoned), and apes live in the woods. The apes are a super race of apes because of the experimentation that's been done on them by the evil humans ten years earlier.Soon, humans decide to invade ape territory because they want to fix a dam in order to restore electricity. But an evil human murders an ape son, and it breeds hatred of humans within the ape population. Only the peaceful head of the apes, Caesar, holds the apes back. But his rival, Koba, hates humans after the killing, and he tries to murder Caesar and frame the humans for it. This starts a war, with the apes invading the human area and killing and imprisoning them.Sounds like an anti-ape movie, right? Nope. Even with all this, it is ""all the humans' fault."" Like I said: CNN HAMAS coverage or Trayvon Martin coverage. And I've had enough of that in real life news. I don't need to pay to see it in a dark movie theater in a long, boring silver screen diatribe.And neither do you (but if you must, do not pay extra to see it in 3D – the 3D stinks). Thanks, Rupert Murdoch.I had to laugh as the audience at the screening I attended applauded this tripe at the end.

This was my first entry, and it wasn't as disappointing as I feared. Though it took me about 30 minutes before I 'believed' the CGI graphics (something I did not experience with Avatar, or even Jurassic Park back in the day), I admired the ethical and moral questions the movie brings up. Without giving away spoilers, the story can easily be seen as a metaphor for certain social and environmental issues.Jason Clarke plays a believable character and I loved Gary Oldman (but on the other hand: can't remember him ever letting down in a role). As I said, somehow the apes do not look real or believable to me, especially when they are not in close up or even riding a horse. But the latter is also a part of 'the franchise' I believe.The story really saves the day here; it makes this movie stand out against the deep pool of mediocre crap that is usually thrown at the blockbuster audiences.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
506,hp-proli,They needed a hydroelectric power plant to run their radio?,5,3 January 2015,"I, too, was a real fan of the original story line of The Planet of the Apes series of films from the '70s. And, I wanted to enjoy the story as reinterpreted here. But, they ruined the experience for me by demonstrating how little they think of the viewers. I try to give dramatic license to science fiction films by overlooking the holes in the techno-babble they spew to support their story lines. But, in this case, it seemed that a major part of the premise of the story was that this hydroelectric dam up in the hills was crucial to getting their radio transmitter powered up. Seriously? They needed a hydroelectric dam to be restored to operating condition to make contact with the rest of the surviving human race? They were ready to go to war with the apes for enough power to run their transmitter, and they needed a whole power plant to do it?That is actually the premise put forth in this film - in almost as many words. I very nearly stopped watching when they trotted this nonsense out. But, I wanted to give the film makers an opportunity to redeem themselves. They failed. They further buried themselves by claiming that their nuclear power plants had ""run out"" long before their silly fossil fuels. And, rather than de-emphasize the absurd plot element by just quietly letting it pass (because there was no reason to make it that important), they come back later and remind us - by showing their amateur radio setup that could have been run off of car batteries, rather than a hydroelectric power plant.The characters were generally shallow and/or cliché. The idea that only ten years had transpired was made an absurdity by the set designs and the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.This film does shame to the original franchise. It would have been better had I been on the payroll to stop them from embarrassing themselves with such silliness - and, I am in no way involved with show business.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
507,PatheticCinephile,I have a very distinct opinion about this movie.,4,7 July 2017,"So in anticipation of the next Planet of the apes movie, War for the Planet of the Apes, which I am extremely excited for but not for the same reason as everyone else, I have decided to review one of few films which I have a very distinct opinion on. First of all I admire the original 1968 Planet of the Apes very much and one of the reasons one of the reasons I went to see this movie was because people have claimed it to be better than the original. Unfortunately with all the praise this movie was getting it was disappointing to find that this movie was not good.I am the only person so far that doesn't like this movie. I don't know anyone who didn't like this movie. I will state my reasons for not liking this movie.The first thing I have to start with is the characters with the exception of the protagonist Caesar. I am guessing you are wondering why I am excluding Caesar from the negative aspects of the film but I will get to that later. Anyway, I think most of the characters in the film are either dull or clichéd. I will give some examples and you will understand(or not). One example is the antagonists. The character Koba in my opinion was a very clichéd villain and so was Gary Oldman's. How were they clichéd? Well, the problem is that the villain just hates and has really no other interesting motivation. Another example is some of the human characters which were just dull and that is all I can really say because there isn't much to them. The second problem I have with this movie is the plot. There isn't much to say about the plot because again like most of this movie there isn't much to it and it also feels very familiar. The other problem with the plot is that it doesn't ever seem to try to grab the viewer's attention. And the final problem with the plot was the horrific climax. The problem with the climax is that first its a complete shift in tone, second it is poorly executed and over the top in the worst way and third it is completely lacking in suspense. I think that now there isn't much left to complain about therefore I will resort to slightly complaining about the visuals. I think that the visuals are definitely something that the movie did right but at the climax they were the complete opposite. Even though I may not like this movie it does have one if not two redeeming qualities. One is of course Andy Serkis's Oscar worthy performance. The other redeeming quality is Andy Serkis's character, Caesar. I felt that Caesar was an interesting protagonist with well realized struggles that Andy Serkis helped portray. Overall Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a dull, clichéd, poorly written movie, even though it has an interesting protagonist and a phenomenal performance from Andy Serkis and that is why it gets a 2/4. I hope the next movie improves on this.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
508,nicky-the-hutt,It is an alright movie... but... come on...,6,29 October 2014,"In this review I will focus on what I thought was negative. Post 2000's, three directors made ""origins"" movies for the Planet of the Apes classic about the distant future of an Earth ruled by apes. Three movies about a self-evident prequel implied in the classic. The first by Tim Burton being a little bit more of a remake, the two others offering a plot that's just a total conversion of a zombie apocalypse plot.Because ""origin"" movies are a trend we have to get one for each classic, but at some point it has got to stop with the ""almost there"" episodes for Planet of the Apes and it's time to make a real story. I am an idiot to think that with ""Dawn"" in the title the movie would deliver something about a Planet of the Apes, but with a high rating of 8/10 on IMDb as of today I didn't expect Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to be just this: the dawn. Again. Second time, and without James Franco (Then what's the point?). ""Origins"" movies that redundantly repeat the implied preceding events from a cultural classic need to add something, and I don't think an uprising of very-humanly reasoning and communicating apes is an addition to what we already knew. We imagined it, we've seen it, maybe not in Full HD, but we definitely got it, only we come back for something new, which this movie doesn't really deliver.So what else didn't I like?The visual technology has maybe advanced a little bit, and the apes look even more real, and with human-like facial expressions (Serkis- like) and posture that the viewer can detect, you can tell the difference between the apes, you can start to learn their names as they are repeated several times, but here's the problem: by the time the Earth becomes the Planet of the Apes, the characters will change, be replaced and the public will not really remember because we're human and can't even distinguish separate species among the apes family to begin with. The bad guys. Unsurprisingly Gary Oldman had to be ""that guy"", you know, like Stephen Lang in Avatar. ""That guy"" who from the very first appearance represent the narrow minded, the conservative, the pepper in humanity. The guy who ruins a good thing by being too stereotypical. Whenever that happens in a movie, the real bad guys are the unimaginative writers. The good guys. What did they do again? They talked. Past the few scenes you might think they helped in the plot, but you'll actually have to thank chance and miracles that affected the turn over of events nearing the end. So basically they have good will, and they are supposed to balance out Gary Oldman's character's bad influence. Which by the way is just this, bad influence. His character did little to no damage in the events of the movie (in a city that was already in ruins), so he could have just kept quiet during the entire movie and it would have ended the same. The end. Remember Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes from 2001? It was barely an open ending, more like a big twist acting like a final question mark to mess with you, but it feels in no way like a ""to be continued."" 13 years later, it was not continued, so I was right to assume so when I watched it in the theaters. Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes both end with an obvious ""to be continued..."" open ending. What's next? ""Just two more hours before the Planet of the Apes""? ""Please Bear with Me, it's Almost the Planet of the Apes""?Yes, it is visually entertaining, but if you're going to make sci- fi, write a story already!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

511,johny-16-103572,Apes outperform humans,8,4 December 2014,"I have to say, I'm a big fan of Planet of the apes movies. Since watching the first one when I was a kid, the images have been carved in my mind, especially one with statue of liberty, which I find to be one of the most astonishing scenes in history of movies.The Rise of the planet of the apes was really good so I had high expectations for Dawn as well.But my feelings are mixed, after I watched it for second time. The part of the movie where we see development of the apes civilization is incredibly well done, the feel, the look and the acting is superb, especially when it comes to tense situations between Cesar and Kobe.A close encounters between humans and apes are also very well done, extremely realistic, if we could say that for a movie with talking apes.There are two main drawbacks in this movie, and first one is the plot. I find it quite strange that humans found themselves incapable of producing electricity and their only hope was to reactivate the dam. I'm sure that in those days they had solar power and dozens of other energy sources which they could scrape together by visiting whatever is left in shops or factories. Their main goal was to be able to turn on a radio so they can communicate with other survivors across the globe. I'm pretty sure that one single solar panel could generate that kind of power.The second drawback is the acting on human behalf. The main actor, Jason Clarke, we usually find in a bad guy roles, so I was quite surprised to see him carrying the weight of this movie, and unfortunately that didn't look very convincing. Gary Oldman gave his routine, but without heart and soul, something similar what he did in Robocop movie, a lot of shouting and panicking, for the sole purpose of creating dramatic trailers which will draw audience to the theaters.The other supporting roles, including wife and son, just blended in this overall acting mediocrity. But still, I think this is a great movie, mainly pulled by Andy Serkis and rest of the apes gang, bringing a lot of thrill so you end up really caring for them, while for humans, well, not that much.The visuals are stunning, CGI is used incredibly well creating a believable cataclysmic atmosphere. My overall mark would be 7 out of 10, but because I really do enjoy these kind of movies, regardless of acting and plot issue, I will go for 8/10.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
512,elliott_l94,"I rarely write reviews of blockbusters, but...",9,23 July 2014,"...This film blew me away completely. I honestly was not expecting something this good from a sequel to a reboot of a franchise I was never particularly keen on.I gave Rise a miss when it first came out, but decided to watch it the night before seeing this. I was glad I did. While I thought Rise was a very good film, I thought it had a few pacing issues and pretty average acting. However, I thought the CGI was incredible.Dawn takes place roughly ten years after the events of Rise. What's left of humanity is struggling to survive in small colonies in major global cities, whilst the super-smart apes led by Caesar are leading their own colonies - breeding and growing stronger.The first thing that really won me over with this film was how much easier it was to relate to the ape protagonists - especially Caesar. I often found myself struggling to care about the apes in Rise, however seeing them at such an evolved state - communicating, hunting and showing emotion - really gave me something to root for. Andy Serkis once again surpasses himself - both from an acting and special effects perspective.I will touch on the effects briefly. In short - this film has the best CGI I have ever seen in a film. I've seen a lot of films - a lot of blockbusters with a lot of big budget effects - none of which even come close to the visual experience you get here. Usually no matter how good CGI is, you can always tell when it's there. Watching this film, I had to stop and stare at the screen - wondering whether or not the apes were indeed CG or real apes.The plot itself is more or less what you'd expect from a good sequel - it develops the characters we already know well as well as introduces some much stronger characters we either didn't see much of in the first film or are entirely new. There were points where I couldn't help but notice a few similarities between other films - notably the Lion King and Lord of the Rings. The Lion King elements mostly deal with subjects such as betrayal and trust, whereas the grand scope of Lord of the Rings is relevant in the third act of the film. The battle between the apes and humans is nothing short of brutally tense and visually stunning - much like the Helms Deep siege in Lord of the Rings.This film is one of the great Hollywood rarities - a blockbuster with heart and soul. You might even cry. Unbelievable film. The only thing that stops me giving it a 10 is that it did have pacing issues like its predecessor.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
513,andfra,The most disappointing film of 2014!! A major let down!!!,5,24 August 2014,"I had avoided the trailers because I was pretty excited to see this film. I had heard nothing but rave reviews and people even comparing it to the Empire Strikes Back!! WOW! I thought this could be an amazing experience, but what I got was an extremely boring, mediocre movie with absolutely no plot!The CGI should be praised as it is very excellent, but there are moments where it does look considerably fake. The motion capture is very well done. HOWEVER!!! I do not believe Andy Serkis deserves any awards consideration. Sure, he's talented and yes he is good at what he does, but IMO he's just as good as any other motion capture ape in this movie. Now onto the plot: WHAT PLOT!!!??? The whole plot was basically the humans had to start up a dam for electricity to the city....that's it and then the monkeys start becoming mad and it is apes vs. apes. The whole plot of the movie right there.The human characters are so boring and one dimensional that I felt nothing throughout the entire film. all they do is talk with Caesar and that is basically it. Gary Oldman is wasted in this movie as his talent could have been used somewhere else. The pace of this film is very slow and I never felt as if I was on the edge of my seat. I was honestly waiting for this film to be over.Rise of the Planet of the Apes was so much better than this film. That film had rousing action, good human characters, and above all Heart!! This film really had none of what the first film had. There were maybe two short action scenes in the whole movie.This is the most overrated movie of the year!!!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

This is what the film about, conflicts and the right to survive.This reboot/prequel is the latest entry in the planet of apes franchise. Still remember my first experience with the franchise started in 2001 when Mark Wahlberg takes the lead in 《Planet of Apes》. It's the film which opens my mind, taking me into the universe of science fiction. Its ending is astonishing in my childhood and is still vivid in mind.Now, 2014 continues the legacy of this franchise with DOTPOA. The movie is sentimental in its own way. There are tears, there are deep emotional feeling between humans and apes, and there are angry apes with spears too ^^One of the beauty of the film is there's no real or truly bad antagonist. Even the bad ape, Koba is not bad. He is just an unfortunate primate who went through hell in the drug laboratory. What he learned from human is only hatred. Both the species are just struggling for their lives, their rights to survive. No matter Caeser, the leader of apes or Malcolm, humans leader played by Jason Clarke aka discount version of Mark Ruffalo. To be fair, though, both leaders are always trying to find a peaceful way to coexist. Just the hatred and jealousy destroy the peace.""I always thought apes are better than humans. Humans kill each other, devour among themselves, apes do not. But now. .. now I realise, we are just the same."" -Caeser with a heartbroken tone.#dawnoftheplanetoftheapes",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

516,ykchew97,Heart-Warming and Heart-Breaking,8,15 July 2014,"As a sequel to the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and as a blockbuster movie, it stands great! Not just good, but great!As a whole, this movie is truly touching, from the start till the end. And what makes it so special is that its the heart-warming feeling surrounded between humans and animals. The interaction between the humans and the apes are truly bonded, by heart and by feels. The first 15-20 minutes of the film is amazingly heart-warming. It touches me in every moment. I wished that it'll stays but it didn't, the story slowly breaks your heart. Like everything you wished, comes to an end. But thankfully, it'll warms your heart once again.This movie is like a roller-coaster ride between heart-warming and heart-breaking. I almost cried at some part but it does make me smile a lot also. The feelings are real. This movie feels real.Story-wise, the construction is linear. Its thrilling and threatening.Acting-wise, all the actors aren't bad. In fact, humans are more like a cameo to the supporting character in the whole movie and mostly apes are the one that take credits.Cinematographic-wise, ""Hollywood angles"". Blockbusting. Nothing's that special. It's good. But there's one scene that I will remember it forever due to its uniqueness.Soundtrack-wise, most of the time is quite ""cliffhanging"". It plays and it turns away whenever the warmest part comes. Its like tears almost shed but it stuck at the frame of your eyes.Effect-wise, CGI had made me think that the apes are real. It's better than today's standard. Its better than the Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Truly Amazing. All you can expect will be there!Overall. I rated it 8 out of 10 for the following reasons. 1.One-liner could be better. 2. Directing could be better or more unique(potentially). 3. Music should be less ""cliffhanging"". 4. Not that original. Minor cliché can be found.Anyhow, I highly recommended this flick. This is a must-watch in 2014!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
517,luke-walpole,"I come to praise Caesar, not bury him!",10,5 August 2014,"The star of this show is without a shadow of a doubt Andy Serkis' Caesar. The character himself is a much more complex ape than we saw in 'Rise'. He has to balance Vito Corleone-esque family duties with an at times burdening leadership, whilst also having to contend with the mesmerisingly malevolent Koba (Kebbell). The range of emotions that Serkis is able to portray through the magic that is Mo-Cap is incredible. After a while you forget that each of the Monkeys that we see are all men clad in green morph suits and laden with small sensors. This could be the film that makes Mo-Cap relevant in the same way that the superlative Avatar made 3D a serious concept in Hollywood. Fortified by Caesar's brilliance, I don't think it's too far a stretch to say that this form of production is the future of special affects, as it's allowing acting to make a comeback after over a decade of computer generated monopoly. That being said, the actual action sequences are stunningly executed and are rich with tension from beginning to end and there are times when this feels more like an action thriller than a sci-fi.Less convincing are the humans in the piece, as well as a slightly predictable main story. Malcolm, played by the ever dependable Jason Clarke, is perhaps the only human who is allowed a back story and enough time on screen to grow and show some depth. His chemistry with Caesar really drives the story onwards, but the rest of the human cast seem somewhat underused. The epitome of this is the brilliant Gary Oldman, who is only afforded a small amount of back story and time on screen and I feel like that's a waste. Moreover, Clarke's new family just seems like a very blatant attempt to force the viewer to see the overriding similarities, not differences, between the apes and the humans. However none of this ever really annoys to any great extent as the mixture of the Apes and the action remedies any minor problems.Therefore when you look at this as a whole it is simply fantastic. It's a sprawling action epic laced with heart, tension and deceit and builds upon 'Rise's' positives. Towards the end of the film the sun does indeed rise and the light of dawn floods through San Francisco. Of course when you look at the film trilogy (with a third installment expected in 2016) this does represent the birth of a new Earth and the start of a war but it may just signify the latest evolution to sci-fi and visual effects. Hail Caesar!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
518,maxgreenblatt,"Fun summer movie, would recommend",6,15 July 2014,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is about hyper intelligent apes who have been genetically altered by humans. In the beginning of the film that causes no problems for anyone. In fact, the remaining humans are unaware of these super apes. Humans have almost completely died out from a deadly outbreak of a virus; which was made in a lab by scientists. Time is then manipulated, as ten years fly by within minutes. We are quickly taken into the near future. The remaining humans in San Francisco are nearly out of power, and are in desperate need to find a new source. When the humans explore for a power source, and stumble into the apes, they kill one. The apes, led by Caesar, are furious. They set specific boundaries that cannot be crossed by the humans. An early conflict arises when the humans need to cross, as they think they have found a new energy source. It is a dam on the apes territory. This dam could potentially power the remaining human's civilization. Written by Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver and adapted from the original novel, ""La Planète des Singes"" by Pierre Boulle, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a sequel to Rise of the Planets of the Apes. It is the 2nd film in the prequel series to the original movie Planet of the Apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is Directed by Matt Reeves. Jason Clarke as Malcolm, and Gary Oldman as Dreyfus star in this movie, as leaders of the human survivors. Keri Russell also stars in the movie. She plays Ellie, a human survivor and Malcolm's love interest. Andy Serkis voices Caesar, the leader of the apes. The Major Dramatic Question of the movie is ""What will happen next?"" This movie ends with a major cliffhanger, and the audience is left questioning to themselves about the future of this movie franchise; what will happen of Malcolm, how will the war between the two species go, are there more human survivors? A major psychological theme that recurs in this movie is greed. Koba, Caesar's 2nd in command, has an undying hatred of humans, lasting at least ten years after humans nearly died out. Caesar tolerates humans and their needs during this movie. Koba cannot stand how Caesar trusts humans and requests he rethink his policies towards humans. Caesar does not consider turning on the humans. Koba then attempts to kill Caesar and frames the humans. He then gains trust from most of the apes, who think their beloved leader, Caesar is dead, to attack the humans. Koba was willing to kill his leader for more power and to become the new leader. His greed proves to Caesar later in the film, that not all apes are great beings. This movie questions character motives. It asks why people, or the genetically modified apes in this case, act the way that they do. This makes the film a Psychological Realism. It's theme's and character development are the primary Elements of Drama involved in the movie, making it a Character/Thought Emphasis Genre. The characters Koba and Caesar have vastly different perspectives of the humans, and how to engage with them. One of the main elements of the movie is how they fight each other to get their way. A hugely important theme in this film is leadership. Leadership is relevant both in the human world, with Dreyfus and Malcolm, and in the ape world, with Caesar and Koba. Each leader has different approaches and works to influence their people. Caesar is a multi-dimensional character. In the exposition of this feature, he is a strong leader and wants nothing to do with the humans. When the humans need his help, and diplomatically request access to the dam he hesitantly allows them into the apes land. By the resolution of the movie, he realizes how many humans can be great people like Malcolm, Ellie or Will Rodman (from Rise of the Planet of the Apes), and ends up helping Malcolm, by warning him of the inevitable war. The major conflict in this movie is a physical one. It is the war between ape and human. This movie is much closer to the Fantasy side of the Scale of Verisimilitude. Even though parts of this movie is believable, the majority of the film is not possible and is a work of Fantastical Science Fiction. This movie is a fun summer flick. The CGI makes the apes look very real, helping the audience get really sucked into this fantasy film. The apes language use is slow, menacing and concise. They're deep voices are startling and add to character of the apes, particularly Caesar. The action scenes are exciting to watch. Both the depiction of how the humans live in their post- apocalyptic world, and how the apes live, in their forest tree houses is interesting. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes satisfies the Dual Purpose of Art. It entertains, arousing plenty of emotions. It thrills, excites, and terrorizes, with the thought of a interspecies war. It also instructs, stimulating the thoughts of the audience. It questions what will happen next, and how will the war proceed. This movie was a worthwhile watch, and an exciting, engaging film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
519,Kozzy995,"well done. Actually, it had some pink on it.",7,12 July 2014,"One thing's for sure. This is far better than the original film Battle for the Planet of the Apes. This one had good excitement and tension. I'm not a fan of CGI, but the film had no special effects out of place. Also, Andy Serkis was perfect for the role of Caesar. Everyone acted well, and the story was decent. But I might be a bit tough on the movie since I did see Braveheart earlier that dayOn another note, If you do see this movie, don't be afraid to know that the humans won't be portrayed as total jerks who want to war on Apes. I was afraid of this when I walked in (like will they throw something about the environment or animal rights into the film?) And there is the dumb pg-13 F-bomb thing in here, too.

520,messiinter,A Summer Blockbuster Done Right,9,13 April 2015,"(Disclaimer: Just so you're aware, I wrote this review immediately after I went to see Dawn for the first time, and am just editing it now. Due to my initial ""blows-ones-socks-off"" effect, I may exaggerate its quality ever so slightly, especially in the final paragraph.)I occasionally watch a movie that is so good, that I feel compelled to tell the whole world about it. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one such movie. Dawn's predecessor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, resurrected the name of the Planet of the Apes franchise in the eyes of most critics and movie-enthusiasts. It was a thoroughly entertaining film with a story which was both credible and interesting, even if it didn't stimulate one's cerebral cortex to the full extent. But if Rise was strong, then Dawn is the titan Atlas on steroids.This new installment is directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Gary Oldman and a wealth of semi-obscure actors who show special talent.Here is the movie's premise. Dawn takes place ten years after the events of Rise. The drug ALZ-113, which enhances the intelligence of apes but has a fatal effect on humans, has caused a contagious virus that has wiped out the majority of the world's human population. The intelligent apes, led by Caesar, now live in the redwood forest just north of San Francisco. A group of humans, genetically immune to the virus, is stationed in the nearby city, but its means of survival are quickly dwindling. The humans must regain electrical power to endure, and their only hope of this is to attain access to a hydroelectric dam outside the city. Unfortunately for them, the dam lies in the apes' territory, and, because of recent events, hostility could erupt from even the most paltry coaxing.I think what I like most about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is that it isn't afraid to take dark and unexpected turns to better the story. The movie is next to impossible to predict. Very few characters in the movie are black and white. The villains have justifiable motives, and the protagonists have shades of grey. The character relationships and development are some of the best I've ever seen in film. Gary Oldman is superb as ever, but he is eclipsed by Andy Serkis as Caesar. Andy conveys such a great sense of authority in his character, but also is a master at transmitting softer emotions. His performance was, without question, number one for me up until that point in 2014. Toby Kebbel, who plays a bonobo named Koba who has an acute loathing for humans, is also superb. I loved how the movie exhibited the culture that the apes have formed. The audience gets to see their way of life and their code of law as well as their moral code. A sense of family is also apparent. The cinematography is superb and the CGI has very few equals.However, one minor gripe I have with Dawn is that the human characters are occasionally lacking in grit and aren't always as interesting as they could be. Perhaps it is because they are downright overwhelmed by Caesar and his fellow apes.I implore you not look upon this movie as some doltish flick about talking apes that want to take over the world. It is more than that on every level, and it is imperative that you watch it. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is worth every penny at the box-office and the time you spend watching it may just be the most rewarding 131 minutes of your existence. Over and out.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
521,thesausages,A summer blockbuster with meaning?,7,8 August 2014,"The release of a Michael Bay Transformers installment, delivering computer generated explosions to theatre goers across the world, is always a cue for critics and self-proclaimed critics alike to bemoan the lack of real meaning in Hollywood's summer blockbusters. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves's entry in a series which is fertile ground for meaningful metaphor, aspires to meet that challenge.To be sure, the film is a surprisingly beautiful one. Weta Digital's work animating the apes around the motion capture framework of Andy Serkis and his fellow cast-members's performances is a true triumph in computer generated imagery. The direction and cinematography is equally well done, as numerous sequences throughout the movie do an expert job of visually painting the story on screen. Koba's ploy to distract human guards for instance is simply beautiful in its horror.Is Dawn of the Planet of the Apes then the definitive blockbuster? It appears to check all the requisite boxes, including the one Michael Bay all but pretends doesn't exist—contains depth of message.On that last criterion, I'm not sure it actually does.I will not include a spoiler alert, because it's arguably no spoiler at all to say that war between ape and man-kind breaks out. Along with the deliberate parallel construction of both characters and character motivations between the two groups, the nicely packaged message the film contains clearly is of the folly of war and how inevitable our flaws make it be.It's a brilliant message on its own, one whose timing could not be more apt given recent events in the Middle East. As it is executed in the film though, the end result is the impression that in the pursuit of including a impactful message, the film itself paradoxically suffers.There is never any pretension, even right at t=0, that peace would be achievable. While this adds an element of tension to the film—we are transfixed by the unfolding story much in the way we may be watching two runaway trains on the same track barreling towards each other—the story begins to drag when this one element begins to wear thin.In service of this end result, the character motivations are often weakly defined and flat. Instead of character arcs, each and every character on both sides rise little above classic Hollywood archetypes. Caesar, the wise but conflicted leader. Koba, the wise leader's hurt and violent foil. Malcolm, the hopeful and idealistic peace broker. Dreyfus, the equally prejudicial human parallel to Koba.The simple construction of the characters leads to numerous irrational interactions between many of them throughout the story. There is a fine line between having irrationality and failure as a theme and a story which itself is nonsensical, and as a result of the lack of character depth and story intricacy, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to its detriment veers ever so slightly towards the latter.This is no fatal flaw to the film's blockbuster credentials, as many more a movie fail on far greater levels. Still, the overall message delivered in this blockbuster is not enough to earn Dawn of the Planet of the Apes certification as a big summer movie that transcends the genre as some may hope or even believe.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

However, this movie is merely an entertaining fantasy that doesn't provide anything special rather than excessive visual effects. There is not enough character development. There are stereotype bad guys and good guys, alongside ugly looking bad apes vs some cute good apes. There are some Bollywood-style predictable twists that makes the movie pretty boring. I couldn't see some gifted dialogs, cinematography and good acting in this movie. It was a waste of time and money (Nothing special about 3D).

The plot literally makes no sense whatsoever, none. Every element is counter-rational. The graphics look like what you'd get if you let a 9-year old use freeware from the web. From the first scene, you're scratching your head ""is that supposed to be a bear?"" ""why is there a bear?"" Then you spend the next hour thinking ""wait...why'd he do that? Why blow that up? Why are they hurt?"" No part of this movie makes any sense whatsoever. You could get better plot and dialog if you just asked a couple of 8-year old boys to make up a story about monkeys.

But that aside, this movie is fantastic standalone. James Franco does not return as a main character in this movie, but we have some equally as good ones that work throughout the movie. The ape's CGI just gets even better, more detailed and scarily realistic than the first movie. One of my favorite examples of this is the start of the movie, which is a super close-up and slow pan out of Caesar's (Andy Serkis) face. He is wearing God-of-War style war paint, and you can pick out the ridges and bumps amidst the paint. Music was great, captured the mood of the film very well. Story was also very good, full of conflict and showing how powerful these apes can be.

525,eschimke,Long Time Fan Critique,8,11 July 2014,"This reimagining of the POTA series is refreshing, bittersweet, and disappointing for long time fans. Forgive me if I am incorrect, but this Dawn rendition seems to fit most appropriately just after the third from the original early 70s series (Escape from POTA) and subsequently following ""Rise Of"". Although ""Dawn"" is a very good film relative to today's spirit of filmmaking, it deviates for the worse on many respects from the serene intellectual conservatism of the original's to a more militaristic and ostensible style of interaction. I honestly cannot blame directing as much as screen writing is at fault here. Virtually all action/sci-fi films in the 2010 era are high budget, fast paced, CGI intensive, and dialogue light.In ""Dawn"", there is little to no element of deception to make the film have replay value because of its lack of (capitalizing on) deep themes- not much is left to the imagination. No longer is fear mongering reserved exclusively for humans, as Koba consistently provokes apes to share a similar militaristic viewpoint. Dimensions of character development feel rushed as only the familiar jungle and CGI is what remains in the recent update. No longer do politics come into play when the moment of reckoning is realized, no character ""outwits"" or improvises the changing of destiny except for a scene or two.While this film is enjoyable, the budget -which is about 100x greater than the later Apes films of the 70s- does not deliver in a cost-benefit type of way. The simian civilization has negligible to no autonomy and Caesar is the brawn and brains of the entire group. Viewer sensitivity is lost because suspenseful scenes are way overdone, and the ""adorable factor"" is underwhelming because of that loss of intimacy. Dialogue is brief yet completely transparent. As much as I tried to appreciate each facet of this story, it sort of felt like the 70s POTA series being chased by a cavalry led by Michael Bay to conjure up an action packed yet semi-philosophical rendition of a very interesting concept.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I also love(Warning may contain spoilers) how it takes place in san francisco a decade later after the virus and how there are human survivors. Also the movie had good action and battling in the movie. (Warning May Contain Spoilers) Another things was the part when one ape kinda took over and wanted to fight the humans when Caesar didn't. The other part was when (Warning may contain Spoilers) the apes enslaved the humans and they all ran outside of the colony.

It is so overrated and the movie is equal or worse than the first movie. Like seriously. It is fake ""deep"" and emotional. Talk about being realistic, you have apes riding horses. Like WHAT?!!?!!.This movie ripped of the story line and character development of several other movies that are written way better such as Avatar. The animation and cinematography of this movie is horrendous. I have watched 'Gravity' and it HAS A BETTER NON-EXISTENT STORY-LINE THAN THIS MOVIE. THAT'S HOW BAD I FIND IT.GRAVITY won like 100 Oscars for animation, score and cinematography, which I found to be unbelievable, but then YOU HAVE THIS MOVIE. ITS LIKE HORRIBLE.

As you need to know he background of the different characters in the movie. especially Caesar.They have done an amazing job of this movie. The special effects are second to none and the story line is amazing. Lets face it, a lot of these kind of movies are dragged out and the story line can effectively become very dull.

I don't really know how that is possible but, it just shows how capturing it is.I want to write more but, I am not going to spoil it.

530,mesparza95,Plot holes. (contains spoilers),7,18 July 2014,"As said above there are plot holes (and spoilers) that make the humans in this movie seem more like stupid apes then the apes themselves. First plot hole which is necessarily just the story's fault is how exactly did the simian flu happen, i watched the first film where one character was infected and the main sign given when he possibly might have spread the flu was when he sneezed blood but most would know how to protect themselves from a flu that's spread that way. The only way it could infect so many is if it was a protean virus that could manipulate ways it infected, not a flu.Second plot hole is how people seem to have forgotten that the apes ever existed, even though they were the cause of the flu and also what happened on the bridge. You would also think the government would take some action but it seems they just forgot about their existence, even though there were so many possible eye witnesses even James Francos character.Third is how exactly could the world fall apart? I can understand the flu part to an extent but as to why it fell apart where everything that was working perfectly fine is not being put to use. Also considering that the woods where the apes live were the only place affected by the apes so it's not like they were in constant peril around the world to not be able to use everyday tools.The the final big plot hole is in the end of the film when they find out that there are people ""up north"" coming to help as soon as they make contact with them. You'd think that people would stick together in a time like this, but later on it's explained that they are soldiers.. So why were they not sticking together the whole time? Why did they barely find out that they exist? It's even more confusing when you know they've had power the whole time enough to communicate with them via radio. Shouldn't they have united sooner?I'm also tired of hearing people say to be in suspension of disbelief, because I watched Hocus Pocus a movie about witches were almost anything can go. Where a cat can get run over and be perfectly fine after wards but a zombie gets hit in the head an it falls off even though they are both under the same witches magic and have both been dead for years. LOL NO.Well in the end the movie may have plot holes, but it isn't a bad movie, even though i think Keri Russel and Kodi Smit-McPhee's characters have no real reason to exist. Some of the apes are kinda hard to tell apart until you hear their names. Personally I don't think it's deserving of it's current rating of 8.5 or to place #152 in the top 250 films. But hey, when Jurassic Park has only the great effects for its time keeping it in the top 250 who am I to say that this can't right? :)I rate it a 7.5 for good effort and decently executed film.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
531,TheBlokes,Apes! Together! Spectacular!,10,20 July 2014,"Dawn of The Planet of The Apes Review I'm delighted that this is the first review to be posted on our blog, what a treat. I was quite saddened to hear that Rupert Wyatt wasn't returning after the huge surprise that was 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes', it was a fantastic origin story for Caesar, however Matt Reeves vision firmly highlights that this is Caesars story and it was executed perfectly. That statement was in no way hyperbolic, I mean perfectly. The deadly ALZ-113 virus known as the Simian-Flu along with civil unrest has brought the human race to its knees, with the exception of the seemingly immune, remaining survivors. The apes, led by Caesar live peacefully in the Muir Woods of San Francisco. An altercation with humans eventually leads to a fragile truce, it is however broken leading both sides to the brink of war. That is about all I can say in terms of the story, it may sound a little mundane, it is anything but. There is an abundance of adjectives to describe this character driven masterpiece, these are but a few- breath-taking, thought-inducing, pulse-pounding and enthralling. The direction Matt Reeves took this movie is brilliant, it is character driven with Andy Serkis' Caesar at the helm. There is much rumour surrounding how Reeves actually got the job, apparently the executives at Fox wanted to make the sequel more human-centric and focused on the collapse of humanity. However Reeves pitched them a story involving the ever-expanding ape civilisation because of how well Caesar was set-up in Rise. Obviously they agreed and it has paid off big time, this movie is full of grey areas, it isn't all black and white. It's virtually impossible to pick a side, personally I took a lot of political and racial messages from this movie and about how people are inherently xenophobic for the most part resulting in a hate or distain for those who are different despite there being bad and good on both sides. The overall tone of the movie was great, Reeves coupled the compulsion for hope and survival with the anguish of hopelessness expertly. Two words, Oscar nomination. Andy Serkis' portrayal of Caesar is one of best performances I have ever had the pleasure of viewing, his screen presence is captivating. He is a strong, wise, thoughtful and intelligent being who makes Optimus Prime from the latest Transformers seem like a bumbling idiot. He unequivocally deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Also his performance-capture partner in crime for this movie Toby Kebbell (Koba) has reinforced the message that performance capture isn't just a gimmick, Serkis and Kebbell have an on screen relationship unlike anything ever seen before because of the technology used. Koba in a sense an extension of Caesar only far more extreme, he is a great character making Caesar question certain decisions while also showing vehement hate which is completely understandable due to his relationship with humans. As for the human performances, which are admittedly overshadowed by Caesar and Koba are still tremendous allowing the story to progress at a nice pace. Jason Clarke does a great job showing that despite certain obvious differences that co-operation and respect will allow for far more progress to be made rather than violence and intimidation. Keri-Russell and Kodi-Smitt McPhee do a serviceable job and I have no qualms with their performances, it's obvious that they didn't have much to work with other than going along for the ride with Jason Clarkes character (Malcom). Lastly the chameleon that is Gary Oldman once again shows us why he is one of the greatest living actors today, in fact he has a scene in this movie that almost brought me to tears but he didn't even say a word- what the hell?! Moreover there is one other scene involving the hijacking of a tank which had my jaw firmly on the floor for at least 5 minutes, it was for a lack of a more verbose word, epic. I have but one fault with the movie and that is the lack of explanation of the fate of James Franco's character from the first movie. I suppose you could say it was his job to further the development of Caesar but still I would have enjoyed even one line or one scene showing what happened to him following the outbreak of the virus. The setting of the movie is beautiful despite it being essentially a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Along with the beautiful visual effects of the characters and the setting the score blends seamlessly with everything that is going on on-screen. Every little intricate detail down to the fact that this movie was shot on location 95% of the time enhances what is in my opinion the best film of the year. Furthermore the pace ensured I was not bored for one second, this is obviously a credit to the editing and direction of the movie which were once again top notch. I hope I haven't inflated any expectations with this review, but I loved it, If you're a fan of the first movie you will love it also, it is better in every way. Heck if you're a fan of movies in general you will at least enjoy the story and the performances. 'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes'- 5/5.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
532,pmit-59-731476,Snore....,6,21 July 2014,"Guess I'm a minority, but I thought this was formulaic Hollywood stuff. There were no surprises whatsoever. It's 130 minutes long; after about 20, you pretty much know how it will turn out. There's the stock characters for this kind of story: the wise and enlightened leaders of the opposing societies (Malcom and Caesar) and their loving families; the hotheads(Carver and Kobo)who undermine the good intentions of the leaders; the scene where the families of the Malcom and Caesar get together and see that ""we're really not so different after all"" Ugh. Then there's the requisite brain- rattling battle scene capped by final one on one confrontation between the hero and the heavy, which the hero of course wins. Haven't we seen this before, like, a million times?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

But to my surprise, it is just a wastage of time and money. First of all story line is too bad. Acting by most of actors is not up to mark. In fact, I would say that acting and dialogue delivery is pretty bad also. Sound effects and action is also below average. Emotional scenes fail to serve the purpose of getting it felt by audience.When i watched it, It felt really boring. IMDb rating of 8++ is a big joke for this movie. I felt cheated by director and movie's marketing team that did very good job at IMDb for perusing high rating. Do not waste your moneyMy ratings 1/10. Very bad!!

534,peter_j_clark,Entertaining film if a little clichéd,6,31 July 2014,"Dawn follows rise of the planet of the apes satisfyingly enough but tries to satisfy the Hollywood cliché of having a bit of everything. Something it fails to deliver on. 'Rise' was a good film as the plot was really good, and whilst the plot for 'dawn' is promising the execution lets it down.The graphics however are excellent and the film does deliver all that is promised from the build up and there is lots of 'apey goodness' within the film. The acting of the human characters is fairly good, although is let down again by the clichéd parts as the acting is completely overshadowed by the holes in the plot.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
535,bconnelly2014,Best sequel since the Dark Knight by a mile,9,5 October 2014,"Three years ago Rupert Wyatt took on the challenge of making a new Planet of the Apes series however he would be doing prequels. We were all satisfied with how Rise of the Planet of the Apes turned out as Wyatts directing style and Andy Serkis's performance mesmerized us and left us anxious for more and with the satisfaction knowing we would get more. However Wyatt did not continue with the series as he handed passed on the torch to Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In) leaving him in the perfect spot to make an amazing sequel and possibly out due Rise. He did just that and came out with one of the summers best films. An awesome sequel that was compared to the Dark Knight and deserved that kind of recognition. He completely outdid the original. The action, effects, and writing was even better and like the previous one it was set up perfectly at the end for another sequel movie.The series previous installment left with the virus that would wipe out most of the human race beginning to spread and with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading the apes out into the woods to be free. Now it is ten years later and most of the human race is dead. However Caesar has made quite a life for himself with his own kind and just had his 2nd child with his wife Cornelia (Judy Greer). Everything is perfect until the threat of humans comes back but all they need is help restoring power to their city. Caesar knows that the correct way to keep the peace between the apes and the humans is to let them do their work so they won't have to bother them again. However Koba (Toby Kebbel) who still hates the humans after what they did to him in the Gensys lab. Caesar must help the humans knowing trouble may start if Koba doesn't listen. War is a definite possibility and both the humans and the apes are a threat to each other. Will everything go according to plan, will Koba be the one who starts a war, or will the humans have to attack the apes?Andy Serkis deserved an Oscar for his previous performance as Caesar, but he is now playing a much different and more mature version of him. Caesar is more human then ape in this one. He talks and moves like a human. He is fully developed and the apes around him are developing too. However he is middle aged now after ten years of being in the woods since he helped the apes break out in the previous installment. His age shows his wisdom as he always knows what the right thing is to do, and is clearly loved by the apes that he leads and looks after. He is the perfect leader in every sense of the word now. He is smart, strong, tough, and wise as can be.The apes are evolving too but Caesar and Koba are the only two who can talk at the start of this movie. But that is probably because they got the most of the juice that made the apes so smart in the previous one. However more apes started talking as the film went along and they can all do sign. The medicine is clearly being passed down genetically as the new generation is getting smarter too. Another detail that must be noticed that will be a big factor in the next movie. The apes are evolving and getting smarter but lessons have been learned by Caesar and he should be even more grown up come the next one. I question if Caesar's kids will fight for supremacy at some point in the series as he has a younger son who has just learned to talk and a new born son. Cornelia should also make a bigger impact as she was a much bigger part of the original series. The ending of Rise was set up perfectly for a sequel and so is this one.This will go down as another sequel to be better then the first and there aren't many. The flow of this series and the story line has been perfect so far as you can tell it will keep getting better and better. There is no reason why the next one shouldn't be as good as this one. It is exciting to see what will come next as the first two have been great. I also wonder if this prequel series will end at some point or will they end up completely redoing the whole series and make it part of this. But as for now Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar and the series is perfect. Definitely see this.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
536,aseemksh,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,8,22 August 2015,"An intelligent blockbuster. This may sound like an oxymoron. But the idea that big budget blockbusters have to be purely visceral experiences with little to offer in terms of cerebral and emotionally intelligent content has been encouraged by the kind of films that have been successful at the box office of late. The financial success of films like the Transformers franchise seem to indicate that audiences have developed a palette for mindless action and crave for more films of such type. The studios have no qualms providing more of the same. So, it is pleasantly surprising to say the least when a studio decides to spend a decent amount of money to make a film that is as smart and engrossing as the latest installment of the Planet of the Apes franchise. What filmmaker Matt Reeves has accomplished with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is nothing short of spectacular. He has created a stellar motion picture, which is very elegant in its handling of difficult themes and complicated emotions that one might not expect from of this nature. The story has a dramatic arc that is positively Shakespearean in its handling of the primary characters and the screenplay is literate enough to provide even the smaller characters with moments that help us understand what they bring to this world. The script allows the audience to understand the motivations of all characters and makes it difficult to establish the dichotomy of good and bad/right and wrong. So assured is the filmmaker that he does not shy away from making several ambitious allegories about race relations, historical incidents and social psychology. Not once does any of this backfire. The resultant is a powerful and engaging motion picture experience With the messy and moody origin story out of the way 'Dawn' has more room to explore the conflicts that lie at the heart of this franchise. 'Rise', while a good film had several issues relating to the science fiction aspect of the overall story arc of the apes franchise. But, it laid the foundation for what happens in this film. Being liberated from the constraints of explaining how the world in which story transpires came into being the script is able to breathe and as a result the characters here seem more rounded here than they did in 'Rise'. It is not a great secret that this newly rebooted franchise intends to slowly lead up to the events of the original 'Planet of the Apes' film from 1968 so the eventual outcome is never really in question. But, the wonderful treatment of the material and Reeves' superb direction in particular make the journey to that point seem so evocative and poignant. On the acting front, motion capture expert Andy Serkis is definitely the one who walks away with top honours. The man responsible for bringing memorable characters like Gollum and King Kong to life breathes into Caesar a magnificent complexity and emotional heft that is breathtaking. Caesar is the heart of the film and Serkis makes it impossible look away every time he is on screen. Matching him beat for beat, is Toby Kebbel's terrifying and intense portrayal of the embittered Koba. It's hard not to understand the character's point of view primarily because of Kebbel's rendition of it. Among the human characters Jason Clarke's Malcolm is a definitely step up from James Franco's Will from 'Rise'. There is enough dramatic weight in the actor's portrayal to give the character an emotional weight that provides a fascinating human counterpart for Caesar. Gary Oldman's Dreyfus is an underdeveloped character who has very little screen time and it would appear that the versatile actor was only offered the role to make the character appear a little meatier than it is on the page. The Apes in this film are a stunning amalgam of art and technology. Not for a moment do they appear as if they are creations of a computer. Their movements, their facial expressions are rendered with such flawless execution that it is amazing to watch. The motion capture technology employed here has been developed by WETA digital and they have really pushed the envelope here with their fine work. This film represents a unique achievement in filmmaking in the sense that it is in this writer's opinion the perfect chimera of modern digital cinema and old fashioned drama heavy story telling. 'Dawn' is at times a dark and unrelenting motion picture; there is very little comedy here to provide padding to the serious content of the story. It makes the story tighter and lets the filmmaker make a film that's to true to his vision and not pander to any section of the audience to make the film more accessible.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

They create a rich, detailed world of loss and yearning and create immense tension between the humans and apes.

538,taimur-agha,"Good looking, fast moving, real fight",8,25 August 2014,"VERDICT(+) Exquisite visuals. Perfect apes: believable; good looking; emotional; intelligent; big and mean, great for the action.(+) Right mood. Very palatable setting: wet, quiet forest. Filmed appropriately dark to set the tone for suspense and mystery. (+) Grade-A action. Borderline ferocious battle, apes vs humans. Unforgiving, bold fighters, especially on the ape side. Fierce, intense standoffs between would be daddy apes.(-) The humans, especially supporting characters (including the masterly Gary Oldman's) are undeveloped.8/10SYNOPSISCaesar is the alpha ape at the helm of his forest-dwelling tribe. Kabo opportunistically struggles against him for leadership. Caesar is widely respected, Kabo largely not. Caesar has demonstrated far-sightedness in steering his tribe forward by utilizing his most precious asset, his previous, long interaction with and resulting understanding of human beings. Caesar is a father and husband as well, factors which make him more likable.Tension commences when a handful of humans stumble too close to the ape home in the forest and an upset man's gunshot wound delivered to an ape sparks a battle mood. Caesar, however, placates his people, delivering only a threat to the humans, but restraining from revenge. One man, Malcom (acted well, as usual, by Jason Clarke), has faith in the apes and wants desperately for humanity's sake to access the water tower currently occupied by the apes as part of their larger dwelling area. Malcolm risks it all – he goes solo into Apeland with a plea for cooperation.Caesar accepts the plea and Malcolm's little band of workers begins water works. One bad apple among these humans carries some negative emotions and he repeatedly sparks mistrust among the apes, including Caesar's wrath, which, fortunately for this small band, is measured. Malcom manages to placate Caesar.Meanwhile, Kabo repeatedly foments anti-Caesar dissent by presenting Caesar's accommodating approach to human interests as (1) Caesar's preference for humans above apes and (2) dangerous intrusion into the apes' world by humans who must have ulterior, dark motives.Just when a Malcom-Caesar and therefore human-ape cooperative victory is achieved, Kabo shoots Caesar from a hidden place. It's made to look like a human job and Kabo successfully stirs up a war mood among all apes. He mobilizes them with all arms available toward an attack on the human base just outside the forest.An epic battle ensues. The action is top notch with my attention centered on the apes' boldness in undertaking the attack. From their initial attempt at breaking the outer wall to facing heavy arms fire from much higher above, the thumping rampage peaked when a horse- mounted, rifle-bearing Kabo dared to wrest control of the humans' sole artillery-mounted tank.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
539,heise8888,This movie makes you think!,8,11 July 2014,"The main storyline of this film can be considered predictable, as the conflict between human and apes more or less mirror the human world (i.e. war in the middle east).It is interesting to see how trust and mistrust between the two parties can lead to a predictable yet sad outcome - war. On one hand, you see some apes/human giving each other opportunities to build trust. On the other hand, the bond is so fragile that a small crack leads to war. Caesar admits war is inevitable even though he has proved that human and ape can become friends.Human and Apes simply can't live peacefully together (Heck, even human themselves repeatedly fight each other).

They return to the Indian sanctuary in the Muir Woods. They have established homes and even an educational system led by Leaping Bull's trusted Sioux friend Wise Man. Leaping Bull's wife Blue Flower gives birth to a baby Indian. Blue Eyes and his friend Crazy Rabbit are walking through the woods when a cowboy encounters them. He draws his gun defensively, and he shoots Crazy Rabbit. The Indians run through the woods to confront the cowboys. The cowboys return to their area in the ruins of Fort Pecos. The cowboys' goal is to gain access to a nearby dam and activate it in order to supply their community with enough water to last them for a little while longer.Meanwhile, Leaping Bull gathers his Indians and rides into the fort on their horses to face the cowboys. Leaping Bull declares that the Indians do not want war, but they will fight back if they must. A cowboy called John Wayne and his group travel back to the woods. John Wayne is captured by Comanches and taken before Leaping Bull. John Wayne explains that he means no harm and only wants to get to the dam. Leaping Bull allows John Wayne to carry through with the task, but first he and the others must hand over their guns. The Indians break the guns apart. The cowboys set up a camp in the woods. John Wayne and his cowboys work in the dam to remove the blockage. Leaping Bull discovers the cowboys still have guns and orders them to leave but the cowboys return to the dam to finish their job. Dark Cloud returns goes to Fort Pecos and discovers that the cowboys have plenty of arms. The cowboys are celebrating the return of their water by dancing. Dark Cloud and his Indian army ride into the compound to lay siege to the cowboys. Dark Cloud manages to charge with his Indians through the gates and break their wall down.By daybreak, Dark Cloud and his followers have taken cowboys as prisoners, declaring that they now know what it feels like to be caged. The Indians that refused to follow Dark Cloud have been locked in a carriage. Wise Man and the other trapped Indians break free from their carriage and break the cowboys out. They find Leaping Bull and tell them about Dark Cloud's plan to get the female Indians and young ones to join him, including Blue Flower and their newborn. Together, along with John Wayne, they head out to stop Dark Cloud.Dark Cloud and his followers have gathered at the top of a tower. Leaping Bull dives in and tackles Dark Cloud, knocking him off a ledge. As he hangs on for his life, he looks up at Leaping Bull, who pulls Dark Cloud's arm up. Dark Cloud tells him, ""Indian not kill Indian."" Leaping Bull looks him down and replies, ""You are not Indian."" With that, he drops Dark Cloud and allows him to fall to his death.The free and surviving Indians come up to the tower to reunite as a group. Leaping Bull says that an Indian has already started a war, and that John Wayne must go and protect his own family.

541,CosmicAqua,Dawn of the Planet of My Tears,10,14 July 2014,"When I first watched the trailers on Facebook, YouTube, and Yahoo I was hyped – I sat in my lounge chair, hopping up and down like many other POTA fans as a thousand images popped into my mind. Oh, yes! Those weapon wielding, talking apes that have always been at war with our species through countless movies dating back from the late 60s. Over time, the hype started to fade as I watched the trailers broadcasted all over the media. At the back of my mind, I started to hesitate to purchasing a ticket.I bought a ticket for two, one for me and the other for my mother who is a fan as well. I would have brought more people, but they were busy watching Transformers. Popcorn? Check. Drinks? Check. Best seats? Check. Cellphones turned off? Double check. While the movie played, the theater was dead silent with only a few laughs here and there. Everyone's attention focused on the movie. It's rare that I shed a tear when it comes to anything, but the movie in certain scenes really will let the waterworks start. I won't spill out any spoilers, not only, because of the rules here, but it is better that you experience it all yourself.The soundtrack is engaging and memorable. I found myself taking in the various tracks along with the movies that I found each one fit perfectly. The soundtrack by the way can be found on YouTube, and it's worth listening to. In fact, as I write the review I have been playing the first track on repeat. The CGI is amazing to the point that I had to look closely to make sure they were not real apes. A lot of movies these days to me don't produce the realistic CGI to me, but this movie delivers. The special effects are wonderful. The storyline is great, but as I mentioned before I will not spill out the spoilers out of respect for those who have not seen it.It's important to note that the Charles Heston POTA and Tim Burton's version have nothing to do with Rise and Dawn. Rise and Dawn are reboots. If you want to know what happens between Rise and Dawn, check out the novel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: Firestorm that has already been released a few months ago.That's my summary review of the movie. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did. In fact, this coming weekend I am going to buy another ticket just to watch it again.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
542,destinhpark,THE summer flick of '14 and one of the greatest sci-fi's in recent memory.,9,11 July 2014,"It took me a long time to finally get around to watching ""Rise."" Much too long. I went to see the ""Apes"" double feature last night at the AMC Theatre and my mind was absolutely blown.I'll always remember flicking channels on TV and seeing the old Apes films pop up on the sci fi channel from time to time, and I just couldn't stand how awful they looked. They did not seem to age well to me, obviously they're much older films utilizing much older tech, but I could not get over the cheesiness. Thus, I went through my life ignoring the Apes. What a poor, poor choice on my end.Those of you that have seen ""Rise"" and are wondering if it could possibly get better in terms of production value and story, the answer is a gigantic, mega yes. Holy hell. ""Rise"" did a superb job at telling the origin story, Ceasar growing up, and had some very humanistic emotional moments, with a killer ending. But ""Dawn"" does what ""The Dark Knight"" did in terms of sequel construction. It delves straight into the world created in the first film and goes non-stop for two hours providing gritty realism, shocking violence and bittersweet feels throughout. They've upped the ante in terms of animation and it shows very strongly; we have full herds of goats, mammoth grizzly bears, and even horses all animated utilizing a strange and absorbing combo of mo-cap and key-framing. It's a thrill, and of course you'll be applauding Serkis again for portraying an animal so human you'll keep forgetting you aren't watching homo-sapiens. The human characters that ARE here, namely Malcom who is the protagonist that gains the connection of ""trust"" with Ceasar are effective enough, but at times the secondary characters quickly dissolve into the background. It's not a total sham though, because this film truly is all about the apes, and it's a damn good thing. There's not a lot of hope to be had for the human race in ""Dawn"" and I think that's what is most refreshing. I don't want to say much more, but what I will tell you about seeing the film is to ""GOOO."" You'll get the quote within the first few minutes of sitting in your comfy theatre chair.9/10!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Special effects are quite fine, but I didn't spend my money to watch a cartoon. Therefore, another minus, since the authors somehow assumed I'm eleven.

At one point the film have no more feeling that they are apes looking at them all the way as people, behavior, conversation, contemplation ...

546,Cyvong,Good question to civilization,7,13 July 2014,"The theme of this movie is mainly around trust between human and apes, bonding between father and son. This movie contains quite a number of references. If you want to watch this movie, my advise is to watch Rise of planet of the Apes first. This will help you to understand why Caesar can trust human and why Koba will never trust human. The tension between Caesar and Koba is well developed and the script, I would say, it is a bit philosophical. Caesar builds his tribe based on principle that ape doesn't kill ape; but, at the end Caesar has killed Kobe because Caesar declared Kobe is not an ape. I think this is a message about human civilization. The part I dislike is the presentation on bonding between father and son. Emphasis is largely on the apes; but, the presentation is not very touching. The director has mentioned issue of kid's participation in war; but, there is no further elaboration. Perhaps the director doesn't want to give too many question to the audience. Although this movie is largely played by ""apes"", this movie does give audience to think about human civilization.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
547,xcaliberxedge,Apes Great but Humans Lack Intelligence,8,15 February 2015,"Best parts of the movie were of course the apes. Cinematography & the fighting were outstanding. Apes with guns are awesome (trailer). It was a great movie to watch but humans made the movie perhaps longer than it had to be. Would've liked to have seen more intelligence on their part especially from a tactical standpoint.SPOILER SCENES ALERT: DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE VIDEO Example Scenes:1.Gary Oldman was good. He was a peace leader, not a military guy, I get it. But when you have knowledge of the Apes separate region, you have to get expert knowledge to defend yourselves & even with a depleted society you'll have tactical support even more. They had nothing but a bunch of amateurs running the compound that they couldn't shoot an ape who won't listen to their orders. Just one unnecessary scene.They should've had Koba just storm in & shoot or get 2 gorillas in on a choke hold & shoot em instead of doing tricks. No hesitation. 2.Another scene where Koba's attacked by a tank & the shooter stands out there waiting to get killed. He won't stand down the stupid rifle. The tank doesn't use the cannon at all. Get it at the wall & draw the apes back.3.Jason Clarke's character was a problem for me the most. Just lacks intelligence. Know full well that one of your guys hates the ape race & wants to start trouble, you don't bring him on your missions more than once. Then he can't convince Oldman to delay the tower bombing because he lies to him. He couldn't explain that the apes are different & mutiny caused the attack. At the end, he lets Caesar remain too easily in San Francisco to fight a rescue mission the apes would lose badly. I gave it an 8 anyway because the action was overall worth it. Again apes with guns are awesome. Great visual scenes. May favs, Koba with hes rifle up & Caesar taking over. Fights with Caesar & Koba outstanding.the rest of the story was solid. No criticism on the apes intelligence. They're apes. Genetically more intelligent but humans still more intelligent.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
548,teachers1319,This is how great movies are done,9,17 July 2014,"The industry of filmaking is about making people like/dislike a true or sci fi movie. It all depends on how well is made, whether it has a good casting, a good story, the impression it gives, a good direction and the visual effects. If you add all these together, the result is a blockbuster movie like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Yes, this flick might be predictable at its worst, but so was the Lord of the Ring trilogy, the original Star Wars trilogy, Avatar and many others and nobody can deny these movies were successful. In Dawn you have a great human casting: Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell and on the CGI; you have Caesar, Koba, Blue Eyes and Maurice. Then you have a great direction, the impression it gives on people is what really I like the most: First impression, it indeed makes you believe for a while that these CGI apes are real, the other impression is the message it gives people about the neverending conflicts on the real world, whether it is about money, race, political, religious or social issues, in this movie is about humans and animals. I was expecting to see this sequel ever since Rise of the Planet was released 3 years ago. I was blown away by the magic of the special effects mixing with humans and studios settings and the magic of thinking if at one time in the past, the Neandertals or the cro-magnons one million years ago clashed with the homo sapiens much alike it does in the apes franchise. If you thought that Caesar is a great CGI character, in this movie probably Koba was just as good, the facial expressions of these man made characters evokes real human emotions and I simply can't get enough of it. So, I already began my countdown to the release of the next ape's sequel, if everything is put together like the previous two, I will be writing a very similar review like this one.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Because when you thought sequel blockbusters couldn't evolve anymore than they have, in rides Apes on Horses becoming the best of the franchise to date.Rating: 9.5/10+ Andy Serkis & Toby Kebbell | + Caesar as the lead character | + More Apes story than Humans | + Visual effects crushed Avatar | + Matt Reeves ability to balance drama & action | + Malcolm (Jason Clarke) & Caesar on screen together | + Apes on Horses | - Needed more Keri Russell | - Carver was to one dimensional",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
550,DVDSTU2000,Apetastic!!,8,31 July 2014,"Just been to see Dawn, and even though I enjoyed Rise of the apes, I thought this one surpassed it on every level. From the opening scene, you don't feel as though you are looking at computer images, but characters. In a world where nearly every film has elements of CGI, this like when Jurassic Park first came out and uses its CGI to such an extent it just moves the story along and it makes you believe in this world, and you care for these Apes. The story I believe is strong, the cast give great performances throughout. I can't wait for the next installment. Great Job",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
551,ptroen-398-767559,Very enjoyable installment Possibly the best one,10,13 July 2014,"I seen all of the planet of the apes movies this is arguably the best one(and this is extremely hard to do as the original movies were such a cultural icon for it's time).What's even more surprising is how long it's been since a good planet of the apes movie. Yes the prior one was decent but this movie is SOO Much better I'm not going to say much about the plot because that's a spoiler but this movie throws you straight into action from the 1st minute and doesn't let go.The imagery is astounding but just cause the imagery is great doesn't mean this movie doesn't have a plot. It does and it feels like a plot back when Hollywood didn't over rely on special effects to bring in box office receipts. IE extremely believe characters, real drama, a plot you can't figure out on how it's going to end but just keep you in suspense.Bravo! I look forward to seeing the next movie. Highly recommended!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
552,a_digun,Go see it!,8,21 July 2014,"just want to share a point so you could go see it.. or not depending on your taste on movies.1. There's conflict, but not usual movie cliché one. it is actually realistic point of view. if you like unusual turn of events, this movie is for you.2. The Picture is fantastic!! but watching it in 3D doesn't enhance the experience much. 3. Great Acting (for the apes character) seriously, they overwhelm human character.some people don't like this movie probably they think it is kinda silly watching apes talk to each other.but whatever others said, you should try to watch it, and don't forget watch the previous one first, so you can fully enjoy this one.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
553,bob_bobson6868,A Good Movie That Takes Too Long To Get Good,7,12 July 2014,"While this movie is being hyped by most reviewers as the greatest movie of the summer, and maybe they are right but what is the competition? As I almost always seem to feel with movies that manage to pass 120 minutes in length, I can't help but wonder why. For around 1 - 1 1/2 hours you get a quick explanation of why humanity has all but disappeared, how the apes have thrived but still just live in the forest in San Francisco, and a lot of will Koba turn on Cesar, and will there be a Human Vs. Ape war. When this movie finally gets going after 90 minutes the rest is pretty enjoyable. Action in this movie is very slim, but amazing, and emotional when it happens.

554,katybug-22,Graphics AND Story,10,11 July 2014,"I was extremely doubtful but my boyfriend talked me into it. The graphics alone in 3D are ASTOUNDING. Kept my full attention for the entire 2+ hours. Easily tops the earlier movie with Franco. You can tell A TON of money, work, and time went into this film. This is a movie you HAVE to see in theaters, preferably 3D. Usually a movie that's all about the graphics has a sh*t story line, but this one was actually good! Reminded me a bit of Avatar in regards to quality. If you like post-apocalyptic movies, you'll love this. When I determine what a ""good"" movie actually is (in theaters), I think back to how many times during the film I ""reacted"". Sometimes its laughing out loud, jumping, a jaw drop..etc. In this film, I constantly looked over at my boyfriend with the ""omg"" face to see if he's reacting the same way, or if it's just me. We both felt the need to ""omg"" face each other throughout the movie. Insane shots - brilliant camera placement throughout as well. We both had to go to the bathroom with 30-45 minutes left and couldn't get out of the seats to do so for fear we'll miss another incredible screen shot. So we held it. No regrets. Get to a theater and see it. Finally we have a movie worth the rave.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
555,nite-fighter,"Old Tale, lacking imagination",4,10 May 2015,"Yes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, is once again a good (maybe even brilliant) criticism of our war-mongering and fear-driven society. Hatred creates violence, etc,etc.But what I am starting to wonder is, what if the woman had a say in things?What instead of being pushed into stereotypical rules of the healer and the mother, with no character development or depth (in some cases not even a name), they had a vote in all of this? Would it still end in bloodshed, violence, apes riding horses while at the same time shooting two machine guns (like come on really??)? Especially considering that it has been proved that female primates were just as likely to demonstrate leadership.This movie plays in a dystopian future, and once again the writers fail to imagine a society that has changed and developed, no everything is the same, including the stereotypical role of woman, who stay silent and out of the way, and the males who stay dominant and violent and capable. Even without woman I wonder, why cannot Caesar and Jason win this time. The caring father, the pacifistic ape, the empathetic protagonist? But no of course, male has to be violent, temperamental, ""strong"" etc etc. And that is why I am calling this movie a male-centric, men-ego-trip movie. I did enjoy watching it for its cgi, good job weta, and if I switch my brain off I can even enjoy it as the action blockbuster that it was.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
556,ryndanr,Why the critics loved it...,10,5 November 2014,"This review is for all the people left scratching their heads. Yes, this film is predictable. It is about talking apes. It is a film with barely any surface level morals. Now that we've established that, this is a nearly perfect film, and I'll explain why. The first, and most important reason this film received such high praise is for filmmaking. It is filled with unbelievable film school nerd payoffs like the foreign film tributes in the way the early scenes are shot in near silence. Without saying any spoilers, there is a tank scene and a steady cam continuous shot near the climax of the film that may be the two most well filmed scenes of the year. I do have to admit though, had the plot not been so predictable, the steady came scene would have been more effective. Though this is the most incredible aspect of the film, most viewers couldn't care less about this, so I'll move on. The next reason this film is so good is that the characters are real. Koba is a nearly perfect tragic villain. Caesar is an incredible example of a flawed hero. Every character in this film is doing his best according to his own experience. This is a story about real life struggle. There is no good and evil, only difference of opinion. That is part of the reason it is so predictable. Because no one ever acts out of character in this film. Which is incredible character development. The story telling in this film is great for a very unique reason. Things that you know are going to happen, happen for very well thought out reasons. Everyone should've gathered that this film is about humanity. Each ape takes what it learned from humanity to influence their character. This is a great way to continue the themes from Rise and show how conflict is created in society. Again, I don't want to write any spoilers, but all of the big tagline type lines serve as clues to themes, set up for the ape world that is inevitably coming, and character development. That should help you reexamine some of the lines you originally found cheesy. So, there are a few things you have to understand when watching this film. You can't expect a summer blockbuster. Instead, expect something more along the lines of Children of Men, Gravity, or Cloverfield, which is another example of a mislabeled and misunderstood film. All of those movies are similar to this one in the way they are masterfully filmed and hold their real messages well below the surface. This film is the story of all human conflict, cultural differences, and misunderstanding. It's everything Crash wanted to be. It is a movie that suffers from a lack of balance only in the way it presents itself. Dark Knight was a similar film in many ways, including villain characterization through dramatic scenes and diverse filming techniques, but it achieved mass appeal because it held its themes both on the surface and on a deeper level. This film is only on a deeper level. So all these low ratings are really just from people who expected a movie about monkeys.This movie is not for everyone, and I'm not trying to change anyone's mind about it. I'm just trying to explain why it was so highly praised by film nerds since so many people don't get it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
557,jesnenerkelt,"Ape not kill ape, but human kill human...",5,18 November 2014,"I really enjoyed the very first movie of the POTA franchise, the one with Charlton Heston. I think first movie of the POTA(1968) was one of the major stones of the sci-fi genre. So this is why I am a huge fan of POTA, and I always enjoyed watching it. I also liked the first one in the 2010s, but this one sadly is not an enjoyable movie.In the beginning I was shocked when I saw CGI effects of apes. It looked so realistic. It was not very impressive though. With these graphics apes are looking so lifeless. Because CGI effects was so much unnecessarily detailed and you can clearly see that these apes are CGI, and its annoying. But I have to admit that every little detail of characters was at master level, but unfortunately they were looking unnatural. Second thing that disturbs me is the message that the movie is trying to give us all the time. The movie deals with some moral problems too much. And these moral problems start to get boring. In the beginning you see an ape trying to educate other apes and that ape writes on a wall, ""Ape not kill ape."" So it was a message that tells to us in some ways. And the message is, apes are not killing its own kind but humans are. And yes, that is true; creature of human is killing other humans with some meaningless reasons. But in the end apes are attacking a small colony of people who survived after the disease, and start a war. So in the movie humans are generally is very oppressed, and you see apes are the villain but humans are just a peaceful creature. Normally the leader of apes Cesar was not wiling to start a war, but in the end Koba witch is another dominant ape, dethrone Cesar, and becomes the leader and than attack humans. You always see humans very peaceful, not apes. But I wanted the opposite, to saw humans what it truly is. Humans are a destructive creature, and in the movie even if they have small numbers after the disease, they have weapons, rocket launchers, bombs, but somehow they are not using these against apes. And the funniest thing is, apes build their home around a dam, and humans need that dam because they need electricity. But they are not attacking apes with some primitive weapons and spears, they are trying to negotiate with them, and that is not a human way normally. But in this movie humans are the good side. They always try to show us that some people are good and some are bad, some apes are good and some of them are bed. I liked to see humans to attack apes, and than see these apes trying to defend their home with a lots of action scenes. Sadly in the movie they wanted to show how good some humans are, and not everyone is bed intentioned. So the moral message that they want to show is not to blame every one for the mistakes and violence of others, and not everyone is evil minded. It was also a message to racism. We mustn't be prejudiced for the ones we see firs in our life. But this message starts to get boring, and finally I just want to see some action but the action never starts until the end. Last and the most important thing that disturbs me is the lack of action scenes. There is a very few action scene, and I was hoping to see more action. I know that people who liked to see action scenes with a lots of special effects bought a ticket to this move. However there was just only one good action scene, and it was at the end, and a very short one.What a disappointment for me. And I'd like to know that how this movie got a score of 8 in the IMDb. For me, Dawn of the planet of the apes cant be rated more than 5,8. But my score is 5,2.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
558,srkrishnaswamy,"Seen by Scene, this Evenin'",7,10 July 2014,"'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is no scientific film on disaster management. Apes are better with their familial, community agglutination. Humans are strategic --whoever is left to live after a pandemic-- and plot to revisit Apes, as if invasion is necessary. Motion capture technology, 3D are aiding tools; glint in the metal crosses more as uni-dimensional image thanks to the former, whereas 3D did not feel that helpful; nevertheless, the less lighted sequences give enough gloom for the unique story in Time.(Will 3D bring better lighting ever?)Ironies exist, Apes' volatility and concerted approach & discipline as against the scheming Humans, with a few exceptions; Ape Kobo deceives Humans (with a reason) and more than one Human always had the eye to shoot 'em all Apes down! The rival Ape gunning down (no practice!) the drunken Humans who practise shots for a war with Apes, is outstanding, as is the killing of the mammoth Bear. Tree-hopping, building-jumping ones seem routine though the Apes' cavalry repeatedly moving in for settling scores once for all, for pact, on a fiery ride to attack and using fire-powered arms, even while riding on horses are sights to behold, albeit their stiff posture.Producing, for truce-sake, Caesar, the injured leader of Apes, after treatment by the kindly Malcolm family is meaningful, his watching a training video, a turning point for it to fight the internal war with rival Ape, Kobo (he doesn't publish books, he publicises his case, though!), braving his fragile health is a bit contrived; but, his (Caesar's) love for Humans is genuinely brought out and he convinces. Never loses the faith 'Apes don't deceive!', with his eyes resolved to fight the erring Humans remaining, who are anti-Ape, excepting Malcolm family & friends! A sequel is oncoming...Ceasar's eyes are resolute. Apes' communication sub-titles are engagingly memorable. Comprehensible. Indian Epic, Ramayana's Bali, Sugreev cross the mind though not thematically.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
559,jackshapiro55,"Good Plot, But Slow",9,12 July 2014,"Good acting, interesting plot. It was weird because you were kinda cheering for the apes and that made you feel ""conflicted"". Good special effects. Sometimes a bit slow. But the movie could win some academy awards. Also for the special effects that are depicted in this film, the budget of $170 million is pretty good for what is put on the screen and is maybe one of the best movies of the year and the directing for this movie was great. But like I said, it can be a bit slow but it is definitely worth it because it just's adds up in the end to make a memorable ending. It also showed how the apes don't need a lot of things, compared to us humans and that if there was a thing to happen (like a virus) we would be in trouble because of what is (not really) needed for us to live Overall I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys going to the movies now and again.

561,DinoMovieFan,Apes At the Top of Summer's Box Office,10,17 July 2014,"If you thought that Rise of the Planet of the Apes was amazing, you will be awestruck by this sequel. It has everything a summer blockbuster should have, but it is much more than just a mere blockbuster. It hits on the human condition on multiple angles, sociopolitical issues, and personal motivations such as fear, family, future for oneself's and/or others, protecting home, mistrust, and revenge.Caesar is no doubt the star of this show and Andy Serkis' performance as that ape matured into a weary leader of his people improved by many steps from 'Rise'. Koba was also excellent and stole the spotlight in a good way along with Caesar. The chemistry between the two was so compellingly tragic that it is easy to emotionally invest into them. The humans do put up a really good show, but I say that the apes are the more interesting characters here thanks to the improvement in the CGI.I strongly recommend watching this movie because it will be worth your money and time!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
562,dmaturo1996,Incredible film making with incredible messages,9,20 July 2014,"Where to begin? This film is absolutely gorgeous in it's clear picture and incredible animation on the Apes but yes the animation is absolutely incredible. I could go on saying how insane it is how life like the apes are. The motion capture is graced by the MO Cap master himself Mr. Andy Serkis if who doesn't receive an Oscar? I would be so sad. (even though he already should've). Who gives a masterful performance again as the Ape leader Caesar alongside many other great performances from not even real apes but they're incredible. We meet the apes in their forest home and all comes crashing down when they meet the first human character who panics in fear and shoots one of the apes. This is where the incredible messages and themes of the movie come from of trying to live in peace and not letting fear blind. Or hate as Koba who we know had a rough life from the first film was taught hate as said in the movie and Caesar was raised with kindness mostly thus they're conflicting ideals as Koba whom embraces hate wants revenge and violence and Caesar want's peace and safety. This is the parallel in human characters as well. As the human we learn want's the same as Caesar and Gary Oldman's character shares the same violent approach as Koba. The clashes between what looks to be that post apocalyptic civilization for the humans. The Apes almost in a caveman type beginning to society but much more advanced starting there own civilization. It shows how similar the humans and apes are in ideals and wants. I don't want to spoil what I think to be an incredible film. So I will not elaborate further but I feel if you watch you'll see the implications when both Ideals are used and the consequences of each. I congratulate: Matt Reeves in his masterful direction of this film, the writers for a great script, all actors who gave incredible performances, and every crew member who made this film what it is.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

If this is the first time I get the feeling that maybe I should just go and not see the whole movie I don't know, but I still got that feeling. Already at the beginning watching the apes talk makes me wanna laugh, thats all. It's just hilariously, thats all it is and I can't take them seriously. The visuals are nice, I can't deny that - but I am not watching movies because I want cool visuals, I am watching them because I want it to be a good movie with a good story and good characters and a good script.

Even after over 2 hours of film, I was still wanting more and was wishing it didn't end. The plot is a little bit different than the trailers, though (which is good). The characters were very strong and well thought out. The mixture of emotion and action was perfect.

Well, maybe they'll get to that in the next one, because this was more about a relatively small group of smart apes, living in solitude for a decade, who soon discover humans still exist, and must decide how to get along with them (if possible), in a remote part of a worn down san francisco.

569,Wally-217,Outstanding in every aspect.,9,25 August 2014,"The film takes place 10 years after ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes""; the Supposed cure for Alzheimer's, which improves an apes brain capacity, has spread to both apes and humans in the form of a virus which wipes out most of the human race. As a surviving human community exhausts their last fuel supply they seek an alternative source of power in the form of a dam, the two sides meet and are forced into war by the actions of a few loose cannons. It does not choose to answer any questions the audience may have about the missing 10 years, such as 'what happened to the astronauts?' because the answer is obvious, likewise, it does not choose to engage in complex subplots and does not diverge from it's core narrative which allows for better characterisation.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is unique among blockbusters in that it has inner beauty. The apes are brought to life with awe-inspiring CGI, coupled with exceptional motion-capture and voice acting, the English language is clearly very difficult to reproduce with an ape's vocal chords, you can hear the stress and harshness of every word, signing is preferred by the apes which produces long absences in dialogue that contribute to the film's gritty and earthly tone. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does not compromise for action and visual effects; the film is superbly written and emotionally impacting. The movie acts more like a bridge for a sequel to document the evolution of a new ""Planet of the Apes"", but it successfully pulls you into their world and easily merits its own existence.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I thought 'CGI' of Sarkis (Caesar) chimp came across 'intelligent' enough,so glad they made it into a sequel.BUT mainly, I was really impressed with ""Rise"" after recently viewing PBS series featuring an Oranutagne (can never spell that) named 'Chantek', and his similar, real-life story of learning sign-language and communicating quite sufficiently until made to transfer to a confined circumstance. It was heartbreakingly true. (He called the other orangutan's 'orange dogs' via sign language when he was confined after years of human contact}. I wonder if the producers of Rise of The Planet of the Apes knew of Chantek's story. I see in 'Rise' that there was 'cameo' of an orangutan next to Caesar's cage, in the movie, perhaps a 'nod' to Chantek? Thank you. Everyone should encourage the Chatanooga Zoo - Facebook - or contact Dr. Lyn Miles at University of Tennessee at Chattanoogato who discovered it's nurture versus nature', at least for our brother simians - that allow us to communicate our feelings between species, and just let poor old Chanteck to an occasional ice cream cone!

Leaving only those immune, this lead to the predictable story line of man and ape coming together. In comparison to the previous movie, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', director Matt Reeves doesn't seem to have a grasping enough story line unlike Rupert Wyatt managed with the previous movie.The hooking character of Will Rodman played by James Franco is missed from Rise Of the Planet of the Apes; his and Caesar's emotional relationship touching the audience. I find this gap is not filled in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, as the lead actor Jason Clance, playing Malcolm, just doesn't present a strong enough feel of emotion when connecting and interacting with the apes. On the other hand, Keri Russell reflects her emotions towards viewers when playing Ellie; a survivor with a tough and caring attitude, even when disclosing her tragic past. All her efforts are greatly let down by boyfriend Malcolm's (Jason Clance) lack of emotion. The most recognizable face of course being Gary Oldman, playing Dreyfus; the cowardly leader of the remaining population and typical 'baddy'. Considering Oldman's film history, high expectations were made, but once again we were all let down by the lack of emotion shown... just over the top, bad acting!Looking at Andy Serkis' attempt at Caesar once again, I found that was where I was grasped as a viewer, as his pain and anger was reflected through the way he held himself, and the sudden words spoken, roaring throughout the cinema.

With Ceaser (Andy Serkis) still as leader for the apes, we open to see them become hunters in the wild, while Ceaser himself has just had his second child. However leader of the human clan Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) wishes to destroy the forestland in order to reinstate the electricity that is running desperately low. However it's scientist Malcom (Jason Clarke) that tires to intervene, hoping for a more peaceful solution. So alongside his son Alexander (Kodi Smit- McPhee), girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russel), hot-headed Carver (Kirk Acevedo) and Carver (Jon Eyez), Malcom must try to negotiate with the apes before it's too late for them all. What worked well in the last movie was the astonishing interaction between the apes and the humans, thanks to the amazing CGI capture technology and thanks to the brilliant work by Andy Serkis. As this film is a lot bigger, with a lot more outdoor scenes, there may have been hesitation about how the director would work around these larger animated scenes without coming across tacky and cheap. But thankfully the actions scenes were pieced together brilliantly, with the animated parts felling just as tense and exciting as any live action movie would hope to be. Moreover the more dramatic moments of character building between Ceaser and later with his second in command Koba (Toby Kebbell), were very intimate, and it honestly did feel as if you had a real connection to these apes. It was wonderful to see and Andy Serkis certainly deserves some sort of recognition for the role he played. The movie works wonderfully well in aiding the audiences journey to becoming a sympathiser for another species.By comparison the only other really stand out in the non-ape cast was Gary Oldman, who was brilliantly suited for the ageing war veteran still intent on trying to save the world one bullet at a time. Even if at times his actions may have seemed erratic, this was mainly due to a rushed sense of the plot rather than Oldmans fault. The rest of the cast too did well to keep up with the ever changing pace of the film, with the only other good performance coming from relative newbie Kodi Smit-McPhee, so it'll be interesting to see where he'll end up. It's not that the rest of the cast isn't up for the job, they are, and they all portray conflicted human characters very realistic. It's just they were missing just that extra push that the mentioned had.The director Matt Reeves and cinematographer have collaborated to create some stunning shots. The single plan camera shot that takes place during the action scenes are amazing, and a real treat for blockbuster fans. The action scenes are brutal but still appropriate enough to appeal to it's mass audience.The score too does a brilliant job of complimented even the most tenderest scenes, which surprisingly are more often portrayed by the apes than the humans.It's intelligent and emotional, with some jaw-dropping effects. Exploring themes such as parenthood, this movie may be trying to reach beyond it's means, but wow we can certainly enjoy the ride of this movie which takes the audience way beyond predecessor.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
576,yoboya,A sequel to the 2001 Planet of The Apes would have been far better,4,8 September 2015,"I found the movie dumb and boring. Today's movies mostly have no plot and if they do the same old plot type; downtrodden ""monkey"" gets his revenge on Humans.I actually thought the ""Planet of the Apes 2001"" was ALLOT better with a better plot. The end of the movie he goes back through the worm hole and crash lands back on earth; but what he finds he didn't expect. Now a sequel to that movie would have been far far better than this one.. Except this version went back to the ""apes"" back to treating ""Humans"" as slaves. The movie this time relies way too much on CGI effects and goes in a direction even anyone could not imagine. Example a number of ""apes"" about 15-20 push a school bus on its side towards the Bad Humans on a bridge; a bus that weights around 20-30,000 pounds.....",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It is loaded with unimpressive CGI,a tired cliché every 5 minutes, and an unimaginative script. All the apes acted like people, even down to their fights-punching and wrestling while their huge fangs just hung in their mouths. When the humans were behind bars, surrounded by hundreds of apes pointing guns at them, what did they shout? ""Get us out of here!"" Just where were they going to go?

And we can say it had something to do with the Apes and so on! We need to keep it simple. Moving on. What else do we need?""""A new nice guy...Oh, and maybe a couple of ""actors"" playing his family""""What happened to James Franco? Never mind...a new nice guy then. What about more important things now like...we need a war. So, how do we give the Apes a chance against the technologically advanced humans?

Oh, and maybe these two idiots could also just spend their time drinking and shooting for no reason. It would be easier to kill them off that way. This way the Apes would have access to lots of guns, which they know how to use, since...they are intelligent.""""Awesome...but how do we explain the arms depot. Did I miss something about zombies or others human enemies in the outline?""Nope, just the virus.

583,QueenCalafia,"Dawn, a cautionary tale of guns, scientific experimentation and survival of the fittest",8,11 July 2014,"Watching this movie made me uncomfortable. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a knot of palpable tension between humans and simians. Life and Peace are better than war and death, and some understand this better than others. Peace, like the lives of the humans and the apes in this movie, is balanced on a thinning string of hope and consequences understood by the de facto leader of the humans, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), and the leader of the apes, Caesar (Andy Serkis returning from Rise of the Planet of the Apes).The movie picks up ten years after Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Through news footage, we learn that a virus dubbed the ""Simian"" virus has ravaged the planet's human population, leaving only ""immune"" ragtag groups here and there. In San Francisco, where Dawn takes place, Malcolm and his small group of specialists are attempting to reactivate a hydroelectric dam, as the human survivors dwelling in the city's quarantined zone are running out of power. There's only one problem. The dam lies in ape territory. Caesar subsequently gives Malcolm's team access to the dam, while maintaining a vigilant watch over them. The apes, especially Koba, an experimented-on escapee of the ""smart-drug"" creating laboratory in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, are wary of humans, and the threat they pose with their weapons. The audience is wary, too, as there is a disquieting sense that the ""peace"" thread between humans and apes will snap any moment. When it does snap, thanks in part to Koba's actions, the result is a clash of species. Dawn is anticlimactic...just slow tension building. It goes where we suspect it would. Caesar and Malcolm attempt to maintain peace through mutually helping each other's team in critical moments, while many around them, on both sides, are actively pursuing war.When the inevitable breaks out, the conclusion leads to where the audience expects it to--a third movie to be released in 2016.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Story, story, story and story... «Too predictable.» For me this movie was average predictable, and because if that should not be the main complain. Take John Wick, a super cheesy movie with the most cheap story ever, and guess what? It has the same rating as this masterpiece! John Wick is incredibly predictable and not one single review is complaining about it, but rather praises the action scenes. Hello? Wake up «professionals»!Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is brilliant, the plot is extremely enganging, the villian is one of the best characters ever. He's backstory makes completely sense and allows you sympathize for him.

Are there no other chimps or...?And what's with the inconsistent language?

Genuinely where did they come from? And how are they all so intelligent?! But still too dumb to escape a bear by climbing a tree?!!

587,nicolaey3,World War A (Z) With More Depth,10,18 December 2014,"This movie received far too many negative reviews to be considered understood by everyone. Its genius is not on the actions shown but on the messages hidden well beneath its storyline. Imagine World War Z or any other post-apocalyptic scenario (Walking Dead for that matter) where the Zombies are not all just eager to rip everyone apart and eat them and kill them but are as curious as humans as to truly figure out a way to coexist, share resources and strengths, to a common well-being: Symbiosis.The screenplay could have been taken place in an unknown populated village in India and also make the public benefit from exploring a new scenery. But perhaps it could have been too distracting to the audience, since as said previously, so many didn't quite follow the underlying story. I dare to say the director went for the easy-enough-for-a-10-years-old-to-follow script; and delivered it beautifully. Especially the way the reasons for wars are always all but what they are advertised for: they are generally driven by personal gain of power, accumulation of wealth or pure revenge.

For example: in less than 5 minutes, at the beginning of the movie, we have to suffer two tearjerker scenes -the first one that shows the relation kid/dad and the second when Caesar becomes father. Snif. OK, the director wanted to describe monkeys that are as human as us. Great. Forget the subtlety . And so on: the treachery of Koba, his close friend; the friendship of Malcom, and blah, blah.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a breakdown of the war between prejudice vs. empathy and it approaches its subject with intelligence if not subtlety. The cast of ""apes,"" Serkis, Kebbell, et al, are fantastic. In conjunction with the CGI animators, the actors imbue Caesar, Kobo, and the others with such (for lack of a better word) humanity, that it's impossible to take your eyes off them. It's truly masterful what the sfx people and the mo-cap actors have accomplished. The ""human"" actors offer serviceable performances, but most are limited by a script that fails to give them a whole lot to work with. Kirk Acevedo is really standout inasmuch as how fully he develops a solid performance from the almost nothing but the one-dimensional a-hole he's given to play. The film never forgets, however, that this isn't the human's story. It's definitely Caesar's tale and his arc is well told and made me feel for him and his ""people.""

This sequel/prequel/missing link between the 2011 and 1968 movies doesn't disappoint and I am glad.When I saw apes on horses with guns, I got goosebumps. The visuals were brilliant throughout the movie. There was no mindless action. In fact, I was waiting for the war to start. But when it did, I started wishing for the opposite. The story line was very predictable, but the movie was never boring. Though the apes spoke little, you could feel their emotions.I didn't connect with the humans because they were completely new characters and their stories weren't so developed. However, you feel for them towards the end. The protagonist family going into the forest felt like the opening scene of a routine horror movie, but thankfully didn't continue the same way. The subtle moments of tension between the family and the apes were not overdone.

595,aditya_kendki,Caesar Checks In,7,17 July 2014,"The themes of human extinction and doomsday have been done to death in Hollywood. We have had alien attacks in Independence Day, asteroid collisions in Armageddon, machines taking over the world in The Terminator, The Matrix and The Transformers, global climatic catastrophes in The Day after Tomorrow and 2012, and pandemics leading to the wipe-out of the human race in I am Legend and Resident Evil. But these panic inducing themes have always managed to garner an audience thanks to the overwhelming special effects showing destruction, edge-of- the-seat action, and the sheer daredevilry of the characters involved. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes lends a new perspective to this theme. While it shows the perennial undying human spirit for survival and their utter disregard for any other living species in the pursuit of it, it tries to zoom in closer on the conscientious aspect of the human mind. The intellectually advanced apes have also been portrayed in the same light as their human counterparts. Although the transition from the last installation is not entirely seamless, the script is far more rational compared to 2001's Planet of the Apes which had a sophisticated and highly evolved ape colony enslaving humans. This one has a start similar to I am Legend wherein the human race has been eliminated due to a simian flu triggered by a scientifically developed virus. As expected, a handful of American survivors immune to the virus colonize a small area of San Fransico trying to make the most out of the limited resources available to them. Concurrently, they attempt to establish contact with any potential survivors elsewhere. Gary Oldman plays Dreyfus, a former military man who leads the settlement. Soon they are close to running out of their power backups and the solution to this problem lies in the forest across the Golden Gate Bridge where Caesar and his extended family of apes have built a protectorate of their own. The latter part of the story then revolves around the negotiation and conflict between the ape colony and the group of humans who are trying to bring back the old power source to life. This group of humans is lead by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Ellie (Keri Russell) though Keri Russell's role comes forth only as a filler for a female lead. Instead of sensationalizing the plot, director Matt Reeves manages to keep it grounded by delving deeper into the humane aspect of the face-off. At the risk of making it look preachy, he tries to show how a future struggle of survival might be more about introspection rather than brawn. Caesar played by Andy Serkis continues to address the whole situation with a rationality which is completely unexpected of an ape no matter how evolved it is. While he has to put up with the rebellious Kobo, Malcolm has a rotten apple of his own to deal with. The movie is successful in driving home its message of the co-existence of good and bad elements in civilization where the good needs to continue to pursue its cause irrespective of the action of the bad (I can only wonder what George R. R. Martin would have thought about that). And it does this without compromising on the entertainment quotient. Andy Serkis does justice to Caesar's character yet again just as he did to Gollum and King Kong. The movie ends with an implicit hint at a sequel but that can only be confirmed by the franchise.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It stays true to the real purpose of science fiction beyond just entertainment; it extrapolates our current state of being and takes it to an extreme that, no matter how fantastic it seems, is not beyond the realm of possibility.

The camera work is superb throughout - you always get the full sense/tension of the story.I always feel that, along with camera work, the music is vital in setting a scene. This film excels in that department.Throughout this movie the focus is always on the feelings encountered by the humans/apes. We see the feelings of each character emerge in every scene. Something that I particularly applaud. I can always sense the inner feeling of each character on each scene.We get to feel that the apes are not simply apes.

Because of (poorly examined) bigotry on both side, violence ensues. After the high rating on IMDb, I was disappointed by the predictability and lack of depth in both character development and storyline. So much more could have been done with the apes' multi-species culture (something humans have never accomplished), and with the survival culture of the humans. No character in the story pointed out that humans (obviously) are just another kind of ape and might be integrated into an ape (chimp, gorilla, orangutan and human) culture.

599,jasonloh99,A emotional and visual spectacle,10,19 July 2014,"I really wanted to re-rate all the films I've given 10 stars, because Dawn of The Planet of The Apes gave me a brand new insight on how blockbusters should have been. But it felt unfair to compare decent or exciting or thought-provoking films with this epic, so I only cut out half of them. First off, you'll only enjoy 3/4 of it if you went in expecting only dazzling visuals and non-stop action like Rise of The Planet of The Apes (though it's still a wonderful film), because the emotion and back-story set up required a vast portion of running time. For those entering the cinema hoping for amazing drama, superior acting and soul-warming scenes, please go straight ahead. A spectacular adventure awaits you.Andy Serkins became my one of my favorite actors after watching his performance in Dawn. The opening scene showing his determined stare caught me instantly, with his presence giving me goosebumps and teary eyes. His vocal is magnetizing and grand, a perfect on-screen leader that had me worshiping. Caesar is as majestic as an ape can ever be, yet so gentle and heart-warming with the family he dear so much. His performance touched my soul, whether as a wise and stern leader or a loving father. Koba is another role done right, suppressed hatred and anger expressed well by Toby Kebbell. Most of the human actors done well too, with Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman managing to give heartfelt and decent acting.The visuals never disappoint. The apes are as realistic as ever, eyes exceptionally well done in close-ups that manage to show all the raw emotions in the film. The forest and quarantine zones are also great to watch at, whether thriving with life or falling to pieces. Kudos to the cinematography crew, who managed to bring the film to life. The story is also awe-inspiring and haunting. The pace throughout the film is precisely handled, with a plot that raises tension steadily without feeling rushed and packed. For a 2-hour film, Dawn managed to balance action-packed scenes with character development, both parts stretching out with near golden ratio and sufficient screen time. Some complain that the ending ""didn't felt like an ending"", but I loved the last couple of minutes as much as the rest of the film. The finale is satisfyingly breathtaking and adrenaline-pumping, leading to the closing scenes that choked me to tears. All in all this is the movie that cannot be missed, being one of the best in the genre for 2014. Breathtaking, ground-breaking, awe- inspiring,soul-wrenching, visually spectacular, extraordinarily stunning, brutal and raw, grand and magnificent. Words cannot truly describe my love and appreciation for Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, for it is one of the rare films that is capable of touching the bottom of my heart, leaving me breathless and stunned after the credits rolled, reflecting on the greatness of probably my favorite film of all time.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
600,IDonWanYoFucha,Is Dawn of the Planet of the Apes the most conservative movie ever?,10,16 July 2014,"What a thrilling tale, for those who've seen the first one, prepare to be blown away. It's 10 years later and mankind has for the most part been wiped out from a synthetic virus originally hailed as a cure for Alzheimer's. If you remember the virus was originally created by lib douche bag and possible homosexual James Franco in the original. The virus increases the intelligence of apes and simians but decimates any human it comes into contact with(airborne transmission, fluids,etc). A small colony of humans have survived in the decrepit and sin-filled ruins of lib/homo capital San Francisco, led by the proud and staunchly conservative Gary Oldman who plays a more convincing American than most liberals today do. We catch up with Caesar and find out that he's been busy, he and his merry band of apes, gorillas, and orangutans have created a peaceful society in the deceptively quiet forest. Their settlements are primitive, but the apes are content and there is a remarkable level of organization within the society. There are hunters, guards, soldiers, fishermen, builders, a teacher who instructs students in reading and writing, a royal family and even what appears to be a priestly class who possibly double as attendants and midwives for the lovely ape queen Cornelia. The apes are slow to change and adapt but only because they wisely understand that any sudden upheavals and uncontrolled variables could easily tear apart the fragile peace and society they've created here. Their conservative society is here to stay. Enter the humans, weak and desperate, they come across the now forgotten apes and almost instantly disrupt their way of life. The apes however, wisely confront this new threat with an offer of peace. Such genius, Caesar himself is set to join the ranks of fellow world conservative leaders like Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchhill, Benjamin Netanyahu, Margaret Thatcher and Bush Senior. The humans of course, filled with fear and hatred, conspire to destroy everything the self-sufficient apes have built, most likely so the apes are forced to rely on welfare and handouts to survive. The brave military conservative leader, Koba, quickly recognizes the humans ace in the hole, and their obvious advantage, the apes have agility, speed, strength and spears, but the humans have guns, and that's all there is to it. Koba quickly and efficiently learns how to exercise his God-given second amendment rights and arms the apes for war. He's forced to make a terrible choice and ends up almost killing Caesar. His ""death"" however galvanizes the apes and they preemptively strike against the humans who hate and fear them. Koba's bravery and initiative ensures the apes victory over the humans, who surely symbolize liberalism and its faults. End in the end though, Koba falls, but his actions, while brutal, served to ensure the survival and prosperity of the proud apes, and even Caesar recognizes that. The apes occupy the city even despite warnings of more humans arriving, but the movie ends on a positive note as the apes prepare to clean up San Francisco and the rest of the liberal rubbish.

601,s-j-taritas,We should all talk like apes in this one,9,27 July 2014,"After I saw this movie I immediately wanted to see it again. It had that affect on me because I really loved the way the story picked up from the last one and the turns it took in this one. There where just great. So simple and unpredictable but logical and because of that they felt fresh and not copied out. It was just a joy to see. Matt Reeves really delivers one of the best movies of the year for me. He does a great job with every aspect of the movies in this apes installment. From unbelievable motion capture - CGI apes to action scenes, storytelling aspects, building the tension... the guy knows what he's doing.The movie from start to finish has that epic feel, and, for me, what is great is that it has that scenes which, even if the movie was lame, would still be very memorable. From this scenes what got to me the most were the apes talking scenes. Brilliantly done. Especially the scene with Caesar. The way he used words to create emotions without creating a sentence radiated power and wisdom, and were so epic. For that we have to congratulate to Andy Serkis. The guy is the best motion capture actor today. Really knows how to do it good. Two other characters I need to address. The first one is Koba. Whoever designed this guy gets applause from me. He looks so wicked, sick and capable of doing everything that he does in the movie. Of course performance of Toby Kebbell gave life to Koba so praises to him. And the second one is Dreyfus, or rather just Gary Oldman. How great of an actor he is. He needs one scene, just one scene that you could cut out from the movie, watch it and still get every bit of feeling, emotion, whats going on in it without him saying a word, and cry. Oh yeah, there were tears for this scene there is no doubt.Final act of the movie was all so great, but one part of it stuck with me more than others and it's because it reminded me of one scene from The dark knight rises. Going in the scene the emotions were the some, the surroundings were the same but the outcome was different. One you cheer for.I'm gonna watch this movie a lot more.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

As soon as the sequel was announced, I was waiting for this movie. had a lot of expectations. But I am not sure if it is the expectations that disappointed me or the movie by itself. The first part had a theme, but this movie was made just because it had to be done... I did not get the message the movie was trying was convey at the end of it. I tried to squeeze out the message of the movie by myself, it wasn't made obvious. Of course the actors are average, no scope of exceptional acting. Overall, it might be a decent movie by itself.. But, it is the sequel of a classic Go watch it, but don't compare with the original..",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Don't watch this movie because: Annoying false sentiment, annoying soundtrack at the start of every annoying false sentiment scene, annoying acting, thin story line, slow, slower, slowest, 3d my ass.

604,gaiaparvati,An Allegory of Survival: The Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,9,13 July 2014,"Almost half a century after the first conception of the Planet of Apes franchise ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes "" has surpassed them all. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes begins with the aftermath of The Simian Flu, known as ALZ-112 and ALZ-113, a retrovirus conceived to cure Alzheimer's disease. A virus that we witnessed being created in the first film of the franchise revamp: Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). Humans who have developed a genetic immunity to the virus survive in a cluster in the shambles of San Francisco. Malcom (Jason Clarke) tries to negotiate between hostile humans and apes for access to a defunct hydro dam that, if salvaged, could ensure the survival of the human colony. The apes leader, Caesar (Andy Serkis), has taught the colony how to speak, read, and use the tools of humans to ensure the ape colonies survival. Caesar believes peace is possible; however, Koba (Toby Kebbell) an ape survivor of scientists' cruel experiments will stop at nothing to conquer the humans. As war ensues, Caesar and Malcom continue to fight for peace between apes and men. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a technically innovative film but it's very conception is an allegory of survival, i.e.,"" greed, hatred, and destruction will lead to the downfall of any society. Not since Avatar has a world so seamlessly been created, so fully realized, and so deeply felt by its creative team and developers, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver ( Producer, Screenwriters, and creative think-tanks of the rebooted franchise). In terms of technicality the movie feels real rather than a stark replication of a world. The motion capture used for the simians creates real characters whose motive, emotion, and purpose is deeply felt. These apes are human counterparts who think and feel. They control a wild, rampant jungle in the wake of human destruction. Shot in Canada, the CGI is integrated into the ape landscape and used as a clever technical tool to manipulate the reaction of the audience. Often, the specialists change their technique to toy with the audience's perception. Although I viewed the film in 2-D the film is so brilliantly conveyed I often felt a sense of depth and space. The third wall is often broken from the deer hunt, to a frightening bear fight, to Caesar and his family embracing. These scenes are all pressed against the frame of the screen and the characters break into our world. Perhaps the most cleverly conceived scene is when the CGI specialist change tactics: Koba, atop a tank, pulls a series of soldiers from the tanks depth and mutilates them. Since we can only see the top half of the tank and the image is more grainy the scene feels like an uncontrollable video game. This sense is enhanced as the scene cuts to a series of apes bursting into the human's strong-hold. A feeling of despair rises in the audience — despite the parallel between film and video game the audience has no control over the ensuing carnage on screen.As Director Matt Reeves said, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a story about character (rather then mere technical innovation). Both the compassionate and strong Caesar and the brilliant Malcom simply want peace, survival of their races, and the safety of their family's. The slighted Koba's hatred is deeply felt when, in a bitter exchange between he and Caesar over the ""human work"" needed to be done at the dam Koba points to his scar and repeats the words "" human work"" bitterly facing down the leader he loves and respects. The audience feels a sense of compassion and responsibility for Koba's ills as well as the Koba's deep hatred for our species. The character development in the film is what drives the plot and carries it audience forward. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will be remembered as a great film that distinctly shows that emotion and intelligence exist equally in both apes and men. How hatred can drive us to destruction. And how good can keep a bright hope alive for survival.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
605,quantumpoker,Just. Awful.,1,29 July 2014,"What on EARTH are the people who have raved about this film watching? Anything other than a co-ordinated, presumably paid, campaign of solicited positive reviews seems improbable to me.I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I loved the opening movie of this new take on the franchise for it's original and thoughtful way of kick-starting an updated 21st century imagining for the birth of sentient apes. I read Pierre Boulle's ""Monkey Planet"" in the 70's, and loved the original series of movies (even the naffer, later ones after ""escape""). This may be largely influenced by my youthful age at the time and general love of science fiction.I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in ""the real world"" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in ""Rise"", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.There is so much wrong with this movie that i am simply unable to catalogue it, however, here are a few pointers.......1) it is set just 10 years after ""rise"". Yet, in this time, the West Coast of America has in the main turned into jungle. Old petrol stations are shown looking as overgrown and integrated into the greenery as various Inca ruins look today, surrounded by mature trees that tower above them.2) There is a massive population of smart apes who can use sign language, and some talking apes living in the jungle. Far more than the indigenous population of the west coast could ever explain (though only (count 'em) one Orangutang, called Maurice, in the film's only nice touch - a nod to Maurice Evans who played Dr Zaius in the original). He, at least, can also write, scribing ""Ape not kill ape"" etc on rocks, which the baby apes can presumably read??? Are you chuckling yet? In just ten short years since ""rise"", 100's of thousands of years of evolution have been spread liberally, though very unevenly, across this vast ape population, who presumably flew over to the states when they heard how cool the west coast was to hang out at these days. Though, even the apes who can't talk yet, sort of grab that extra bit of evolution needed to get a bit shouty when some ""dramatic"" piece of ""plot"" development spurs them individually on....Actually, i am losing the will to go on, since i would run up against the 1000 word limit long before i ran out of ire at the lazy, trite, inconsistent, banal, clichéd ""plot"" so i will limit myself to one more observation.3) once the apes grab automatic weapons, as they invariably must, they become instantly proficient in their use and have the supernatural ability to summon UNLIMITED AMMUNITION from the same mysterious realm that transported them all in, forged their tree dwellings and bypassed Darwin so succinctly. Plus, they get the ability to put tanks on autopilot.And i didn't even start on the humans tale.....what the hell was Gary Oldman thinking of, appearing in this pile of chimp manure. Or the overblown schmaltzy soundtrack, which ""helpfully' illustrates important emotional, or dramatic ""events"" in the film.Truly, this is an experience beyond parody. As Charlton Heston would undoubtedly have commented to the director and writers of this movie ""You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell""1/10 for very fluid CGI, though in 2014 i begin to question whether this warrants any points, such is the accepted state of the art?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
606,Iamrolu,A perfect summer watch which can additionally provide you with one thing to consider - Watch it,7,11 July 2014,"With Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Hollywood gave U.S. a rare blockbuster - one that was racy nonetheless intelligent, a visible amusement that was additionally nuanced. which ending - it had been a cliffhanger if we've got ever seen one. The apes, headed by the redoubtable Caesar, were going towards freedom and humans were heading for devastation due to the simian contagious disease that came out of a research lab.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) A growing nation of genetically evolved apes led by Caesar is threatened by a band of human survivors of the devastating virus unleashed a decade earlier. Dawn of the world of the Apes picks up wherever the primary half left. it's been ten years and humans square measure believed to be extinct. Apes square measure within the early stages of civilisation, and because the film can show - nearer to humans than anyone believed.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) They reach a fragile peace, but it proves short-lived, as both sides are brought to the brink of a war.In the middle of this land humans who urgently have to be compelled to faucet AN energy supply bang within the middle of the ape settlement. whereas Caesar (Andy Serkis) needs peace, his deputy Koba (Toby Kebbell) - WHO was tortured in an exceedingly research lab before he at liberty needs revenge. Sentiments square measure divided within the human camp too. army officer (Gary Oldman) believes humans have an opportunity only the last ape is killed. His cry remains, ""They're animals"". Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) Who will emerge as Earth's dominant species?Peacenik Malcolm (Jason Clarke), his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) square measure touched by Caesar's humanity and have complete religion in him. However, once interests clash and concern takes over, a war is inevitable. So, WHO can emerge because the planet's dominant species? But, the additional necessary question is: wherever do your loyalties lie as a viewer? each humans and apes square measure caught in their own compulsions in an exceedingly dystopian world, allegories for real-life problems, and that we hope they're going to take a stab gone whereas realising it is not doable within the long. The film shows what forms the genesis of dictatorships and also the concern of the 'other'.The film stars Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell, Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke and Keri Russell.Purely in terms of well-defined characters within the film, we'll simply persist with the apes. similar to the primary time, the ape characters square measure most additional well-sketched and stratified . The humans - once more - feel one-dimensional. they're either smart or unhealthy with the stripped of backstories. When the film isn't raising serious queries, it's a visible spectacle. a number of the war scenes and a searching scene within the starting square measure awful. The moments once we initial see the ape colony are outstanding. Apes swing off the trees, get the walls and square measure most likely the rationale why this film offers U.S. a bang for our buck in term of 3D effects.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) The film has been directed by Matt Reeves That brings U.S. to the piece Delaware resistance of the film - Andy Serkis. The film uses motion capture technology that accurately interprets performance into animation. Full marks to director Matt Reeves for capturing the human emotions and expressions of his actors while they grunt and walk like simians. And nobody will it higher than the gifted Andy Serkis. because the patriarch WHO bit by bit involves realise that his beloved race shares constant follies as humans or his anger once his loyalty to his race is questioned - Serkis brings that rare quality to the character. With those emotional eyes, he depicts Caesar's pathos, rage, sympathy and concern. The film begins and ends together with his face's close-up and that we believe Reeves couldn't have done higher.A perfect summer watch which can additionally provide you with one thing to consider - Watch it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
607,Ju4nm87,Very entertaining,10,25 July 2014,"I really liked the movie. I have to say though that most of it was predictable. Unlike the other movie, this one has some moments when I predicted what would happen. The action scenes are awesome, but what surprised me the most was the sound editing. The apes' screaming and the shooting from the guns were pretty intense. It made me feel as if i were part of the movie. Caesar is my favorite ever, yet Koba made me feel terrified and curious. I loved him. The story itself is interesting enough to make me love it, and the characters are very appealing. It also made me think of something said in the movie: ""we are not that different to them"". At the end, we all have trust issues, and it doesn't matter who or what you are because that doesn't define if you're good or bad but the decisions you make I'll be waiting for the next installment.

I wouldn't say this is just an action war film because of the character development and interaction. I was very excited about seeing Jason Clarke have a main role performance and I wasn't disappointed. A slow start okay... but as soon as the ball gets going it rolls intensely with a few plot twists I didn't expect. A summer blockbuster for anyone that likes thrillers and action (or a.

Action packed scenes had you waiting for what was coming next. Especially noting the very well done effects, (much like the first one) the the apes seem to be almost nearly realistic! I would definitely say to see it, if you haven't yet, or are wondering if this sequel is worth it.

611,charlie-hempenstall,Masterpiece,10,19 July 2014,So the sequel to the surprisingly rather good reboot of 2011 'Rise of the planet of the Apes' is upon us and having watched the movie I was completely blown away. The CGI was good in the last movie but in 'Dawn' it has gone on to another level entirely and it all looks so real and i have never been a fan of CGI. As good as 'Rise' was it was always giving off the feeling that this could be the start of a 5 movie project and now with 'Dawn' that sequence is in full flow. The story shows us human beings on the brink and desperate and the tension between the two species with politics and family plus war and survival at the very heart of it all and it is interwoven really well in this movie.Caesar really is the star of this movie and you get a real sense of all that is happening through the eyes of the apes. Jason Clarke is also really brilliant as the human lead character. Director Matt reeves has really taken this movie on to another level with awesome action sequences with a strong plot good actors and a movie that has real depth and pace.This review is based on the 3D version.,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Comparatively it's a relief-movie after the recent Transformers!Still okay: 1. I kinda fell asleep in between since it was a little draggy and I yearned for more dialogues. It was 90 minutes of sign-language, subtitles, action and other sound effects. 40 minutes of actual verbal talk amongst the parties! 2. I felt that the trailer was so intense but it eventually misled the audience a bit. The movie should have been named ""War of the Apes"" instead.

But it's 2014, please, except CGI, the rest is easy to know before you watch, overwhelmed with non-sense details and very stupid.Apes teach each other human's language but never use it? - Apes live next to human around 10 miles but no one knows? Even the whole world has been trying to find them for years? - The factory is workable after so many years with just a little effort of 4 guys in several hours? Come on, I live in the country where we depend on such power source, to run such kind of factory, we need a big team of engineers, workers from many departments working together on specific conditions. - We just need a stupid man and stupid apes' leader ever to start the war so easily. - ipad, cameras and many electronic devices are working well after many years without power, wow. - Human are lazy,aggressive and selfish. I think when those people living in such kind of condition (no food, no electronics...), they should kill each other before apes come. ... I don't want to list more and more non-sense and illogical details but how the writer can ignore so many basic thing like that? Huge disappointed about the ""second ape"".

I sat in the cinema with a friend and I could tell him whats gonna happen from the minute I saw all the main characters. It was too obvious. So all the suspense flew away. I hoped that I was wrong with my guessing and that the movie will surprise me with a twist or character trade I wasn't expecting but nothing like that.

I was a bit inpatient right after watching it, because the director omitted some dialogs, which could avoid war, deliberately to make the movie last for over 2 hours. Then, I realized I was just so into the movie.Love it!The core message I got from this movie is about trust: Fear and lies are the biggest enemies of trust.

Andy Serkis is to no surprise again brilliant as Caesar, he is the character he plays 100 %. Jason Clarke plays a great role as Malcom, really giving the character some depth and feelings. Gary Oldman, always puts a smile on my face with all his accents, and he really does play the role as Dreyfus to great success. Tony Kebbell also plays a great Koba, only improving on this chimp, who is filled with so much hate and despise for humans.Best thing about the movie is the little video clip with James Franco, so emotional it really hits you hard.One of the best Sci-Fi movies i've seen to date and probably one of the best movies this year so far. Only contenders i see would probably be GoTG or The Hobbit. Captain America and DoTFP was great but this movie takes it to a whole other level.

624,mahendraganza,Getting tired seeing earth being saved by aliens? Try this (y),8,29 August 2014,"I am not a fan of any ""Apes"" series, but i have seen the ""Rise of The Planets of The Apes"", and not quite satisfied with the story; until i see the ""Dawn of The Planets of The Apes"".The story plot is very blur, as Human i might say that i am on the side of human in the very beginning of the movie. But when the story move to the conditions of the Apes race, i was shocked that human race is not the protagonist in this movie. The morality bias is so true and can be compared to real life politics and nation issue; it is the intention and the act defines who they are. Apes race was described as lesser race in the ""Rise"" which human 'use' them as objects of experiment to find new cure to several disease. They being tortured, examined, leading thousand Apes to death. They also being caged and seen by human as 'entertainment' object in the zoo. Mr. Rupert Wyatt describe the Apes beginning perfectly as lesser creature than human race. But in the ""Dawn"", Apes race begins to take control of themselves, free from human hands, and creating new society outside the human country. The conflict of interest between the Human needs of electricity and Apes self-right for freedom and peace are perfectly staged and presented to the viewers with good thrill, dark comedy, and suspense in the same time. It is just like seeing a Nazi's Concentration Camps and the Fall of Germany Army on 2nd world war, in the form of race conflict.I and my wife see this movie thrilled, and we almost not realized that we are looking at a characters built with the Computer Graphics. It is just look real, the CG is very good.Overall, we rate this movie an 8.And personally, if you are a movie lovers with high appreciation to story rather than the graphics or the brand (like, you know, assorted movie heroes kind of things), you should see this movie. Satisfaction guarantee! :)",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
625,Estelar,One of the Best Movies I've ever Seen!!!,10,12 July 2014,"It deserves more than this, but nothing to so about it. This movie has really good special effects, best plot, and it has good character development. Kobba was the main antagonist in the film, and he's been my favorite character since Rise of Apes (2011), this sequel made him stand out more, by showing you his good side first, then his bad side, and the directors did an awesome job at doing that. The movie is really entertaining, and it's really worth the ticket price, even if it is on 3D/IMAX 3D. Best movie of the year! MAJOR SPOILERS! Caesar really trusted Kobba, like a brother, but Kobba wanted revenge no matter the cost.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It's different from what you'd expect it to be. The CGI is phenomenal, and is beautifully shot. It has a sense of realism about it, the apes feel just as real as the humans, that's how good the effects are and performance of the actors who play them. Don't try and guess the plot either because again, it's deliberately done in a way that you think you know what will happen but there's little surprises all the way through. I've seen comments saying 'it's boring' it really isn't. If you listen to the film, the plot and storyline makes so much sense and keeps you on edge all the time. The cinema I went to, people let out gasps and I could hear people sobbing. It defiantly is better than anticipated. The actors are great in it. And I really can't understand why anyone would even consider this film as rubbish, it's literally fantastic.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

This sequel does a perfect job at telling its own story, connecting to the past and leading to a future film, that I cannot wait to see. As far as the effects go the apes are so realistic and the plot truly shows what I truly believe would be a post apocalyptic San Francisco.

628,Mikepalmer247,Cesar is back and better than ever.,10,11 July 2014,Edge of your seat thriller. Picture is phenomenal. Epic and a sweet awesome thrill ride. Usually sequels do not excite me but i am still in awe after this movie. It is truly a must see. Apes not only become smarter but wiser. We are more alike than we think. Humans discover weakness and apes conquer strength. Whoever this director is i hope he continues to produce such excellent flow and delivery. I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys a ton of impressive action and a thoughtful storyline. Favorite movie I've seen in theaters ever. I did not see it in 3-D but i still felt like i was in the action. Impressive movie and i will purchase the DVD and watch it continuously. I got over the fact the apes talked and let the movie come to me and once that happened i was glued to the screen. Ticket was 11.50 but i would've paid twice that. Apes don't kill apes!!!,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
629,tsfjind,technically brilliant still lacks something..,7,12 July 2014,"When I watched the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I was pleasantly surprised about how good that movie was. It had exemplary display of emotions and brilliant cgi with a strong storyline. By the end of the movie, it left a viewer asking for more.Almost 3 years later, comes its sequel. This one however does not live up to its expectations. The setting is more darker, with the apes now living as a small community under thatched roofs in the redwoods. Their peaceful life gets interrupted when humans trespass their home (the woods). If the first one was about apes getting intelligent and smarter, with Caesar wanting a home for them in the woods, the second one is grim with anger, betrayal, war and bloodshed. As in the first one, Caesar is the center of attraction of the movie. The performance capture and modern technological advances are well used. In summary, good for a watch or two; but not as brilliant as the first one.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
630,michaelricks38,Great Date Night Experience,9,12 July 2014,"I took Karen out for her birthday to dine and see an action thriller: ""Rise of the Plane of the Apes"". We enjoyed every scene, even the ones that reflected on Caesar's background and that of the current characters motivations were brief and effective. The were several powerful events throughout the movie for me. The non-verbal ques between Apes to show all the range of emotions and meanings (i.e from leadership to child rearing) and the makeup/costumes were near perfect. The dialogue between man and ape gave apes respect immediately and allowed the apes to have a command role throughout the film without the ""stupid animal"" stereotype. These Apes would kick your ass in a second. Apes had a unity that humans often lack. That's where the film took off for me. At the :juxtaposition"" of the logic and superiority of man and the stupidity of his actions and his failure to demonstrate supposed superiority. Mankind suffers because we don't maximize our greatest strength: his ability to love and unify others in a like purpose. The movie showed us how male-led societies are short-sided in understanding the consequence of their actions (namely the spreading of the Cimera virus) but its a metaphor for current failings. The theater sold out. Long- but enjoyable. All actors were believable in their fear. Standouts- Acevedo + Ceasar: Excellente!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I have to say, however, I just wasn't that blown away. The plot line and script seemed very weak. Amazing that a film with Gary Oldman could have such mundane script writing. In fact that's what was so disappointing. At times it seems part Lion King, part Jurassic Park. While the scenery and the effects kept my interest, I just felt like I had seen parts of this movie before. The human characters were stereotypes that seem to be inserted into too many special effects blockbusters. With so much more quality programming available today (thanks Netflix), I expect more for an $11 movie ticket. Again, it's probably worth seeing just for the special effects, but it could have been so much better.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

The emotional aspects of the movie was overwhelming.The apes exhibiting human like qualities was an exceptional watch and Caesar the protagonist truly stands out.His wisdom and interactions with fellow race fails and the war begins.The build up to the war in the last few minutes leaves you wanting more and if you liked any of the previous ""Apes"" movie do not fail to watch it's finest prelude.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I saw Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and it was my favorite movie for a very long time. Then I saw this one, and my favorite movie changed to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The effects used in this film are beyond superior, simply amazing. You can even watch it in 3D. Everything about the film is marvelous, the plot, storyline, etc.The point is, do NOT hesitate on watching this film. You will love it I promise.

635,Lenny4567,"A lot of good, not a whole lot of bad",8,13 July 2014,"'Dawn' is a very moving film and an effective tragedy. The film traffics in an emotional conflict which transcends its plot elements. We get to see the human character in its infancy, rendered through the burgeoning intellect of the apes and susceptible to all the snares and shocks that our own intellect is heir to. The film smartly takes advantage of this, relying on classical tropes from antiquity to deliver a fresh vision of something to akin to original sin or the loss of innocence. It is a compliment to say that the human characters pale in comparison to the apes. Caesar is a compelling depiction of a leader and carries the film on his shoulders. He's low on dialogue, but each expression effectively implies a conflict and strength of character very uncommon to the cineplex. His foil, Koba, is thinner on characterization but a strong villain, and not entirely unsympathetic. Certainly one's spine tingles when he tells the humans that they will 'know life in a cage', as Koba hasn't forgotten the irreparable harm to his body and psyche that humans have inflicted. The action set pieces leave something to be desired, pandering to the summer blockbuster tropes of violence and destruction, though the first scene in the film is one of the better prologues in a long time. The human characters are dim, and Jason Richards is a little too cocksure to convince us that he is the hero of virtue on the human side of things, although the mirroring device between the humans and the apes, all idealism clashing with fear, was useful. There is also issue to be taken with the fact that a virus destroyed 95% of the human population for plot convenience's sake. In the original planet of the apes, the memorable final scene is powerful in part due to the places it sends one's mind in imagining how the apes took control of the planet, and a virus is a bit of a letdown. The Planet of the Apes reboots have made excellent use of the fecundity of their material. It is common to feel pessimistic about cash cow studio films and their wont to make six films where one was more than enough, but the Apes franchise is rather taking advantage of this to burrow down and tell rich sections of a story that follow a greater arc, much more common to quality television than film these days. It is hardly a stretch to say that another studio or filmmaker would have collapsed the previous two films and likely whatever comes next in this franchise into one explosion riddled movie. It is very refreshing to get a summer blockbuster that is interested in telling a restrained and limited piece of a story in the most intimate way possible.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
636,vps123,An outstanding sequel,9,14 July 2014,"This movie is simply great.Great effects and storytelling. The USP of the movie is Andy Serkis acting as the outstanding Cesar and the villain role done by Coba. The movie remain loyal to its original storyline of the previous film and i think somewhere hugely evolve from the first movie. The conflict between human race and Apes and the circumstances that how they reach on that stage, is comes out so well in the film. I think this is somewhere closer to Christian bale Batman series.but if you are going to see a movie with some prior thaughts in your mind and hope that you already sniff the plot, this movie came with many surprises.And this movie demand a sense of understanding that why cant we stand above from our personal greed and biased towards another race and see us all as equal.

637,slee78,Disappointing Sequel,3,17 July 2014,"When I first watched the ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" I had high hopes as the ""Rise"" was highly entertaining and expected the sequel to meet its predecessor. Oh boy was I wrong.This movie may be the biggest flop of this summer(so far). It was either a very slow/semi-romantic/teary scene or just apes/human gone wild. The actors were horrible- the CGI apes were better actors in fact. The actor who played the main protagonist just didn't fit the part and he had difficult time relaying his emotions through the film. The director's job is to absorb the audience into another reality, which the film never did. There was no emotional connection between the audience and the characters(maybe except for the apes). The best thing about this movie is understanding how and why the invasion of the apes on the human population occurred and seeing the similarities in the human's and intelligent apes' behaviors. I don't think this is a big screen movie, I personally left the theater in bitterness and disappointment. If you must watch it, wait until it comes Redbox or movie-streaming sites.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
638,theeryanlewis,Dawn of the future use of CGI!,10,21 July 2014,"Dawn of the Plant of the Apes is one of the best movies i have seen, let alone this year. It was a cinema 'Experience' full of palpable emotion etched across the faces of the cast, huge action scenes and emotionally gripping and harrowing moments that will stay with you for a while after the end credits roll.The use of CGI in this movie should now be viewed as the bench mark for other movies 'trying' to pull off convincing character models and emotionally charged set pieces. What a lot of cinema goers will not comprehend at first, is that Andy Serkis's body language and movements are not the only thing motion captured, its his facial expressions, sounds and his acting. Every subtle movement of Caesar, every powerful but very slight facial expression, every walk, every tear, every occasion of joy written in his smiles and every harrowing exhortation of horror is all the work of Andy Serkis, not the work of CGI, the CGI turns him into an ape, the rest is all the work of Mr Serkis. 'The Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', i hope, is the 'dawn of the future use of CGI'.To say he deserves an Oscar for recognition is an understatement, to truly understand what he is doing for the future of cinema, then look no further than 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'.The story follows on well from the first with a quick prologue/montage to get the viewers who have not experienced 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' up to speed. It starts off quick, setting the mood and encapsulating the world as it stands Post 'Rise of the Plant of the Apes'.By the end of this movie you will be aching for more and if you're like me, you won't be able to wait.I would recommend this film to any Sci-Fi fan, any action fan, any movie fan!You won't regret it, all hail Caesar!!!!",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It invoked a lot of emotion in me with some parts being exciting and others left me with tears. It was a really good continuation of the previous movie and I was so excited when it finally came out! The characters in it (mainly the apes) were all the same and I love how it really feels like ape are human. Would definitely be more impactful if you had watched the prequel as the connection between you and Caesar would still be felt here since the previous movie! The plot is also very good with slight twist at the end.

Loved the story line, special effects, the facial expressions and the bodily movements of the apes. But most of all I loved the message of the movie. There are a few messages that the movie tries to impart. The most important message for me was : You have to forget the past. We as individuals and communities must learn to forget the wrongs of the past to create a good future. Other lesson is that no community is good or bad. It is individuals that are good or bad. Different communities can live together. Also what stands out are the leadership qualities of the leader of apes. If every leader would think so much about their people and peace at large we would have a different world. Overall a very well made movie with mix of great story line, good moral lessons, action, CGI etc. Must watch.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
641,styrmail-shop,"Incoherent, predictable, boring.",4,19 July 2014,"I wonder why this movie has such a high rating. This tricked me into going to the theater to watch it. So, a virus kills most people on earth. At the same time the apes evolve and become intelligent. Of course this has to happen over generations and not just by the passing of time in the same individuals, but let's say it happened. And so the plot holes begin:All the human survivors are gathered in one building in the middle of San Fransisco. What are they eating? Do they grow the earth? -NoDo they raise livestock? -No.Are they near a spring or well to have fresh running water? -No.Are they dressed in animal skins or primitive hand made clothes? -No, they use 10 or 15 year old clothes and look great.So all these people together produce a lot of waste, what happens to it? -Nothing, probably use the sewers which are capable of functioning forever without any maintenance of any kind. Probably the writers imagined the survivors using the toilet and flushing and the water appearing magically from taps, showers and toilets...What do they really need? -Power to charge the i-Pad to see the old photos. Of course they cannot go to the nearest refinery or gas depot and fill a tanker truck, but they risk their lives going to the mountains against angry intelligent apes, because the radio uses a lot of power and the nuclear plant doesn't work any more. Makes perfect sense.And of course when they repair the dam the power magically transfers to the city, tenths of miles far, because of course poles do not fall down and cables don't cut after 10 or 15 years without maintenance just like the sewers.The apes can all talk, and the villain ape has English accent. They prefer to use sign language though because a language which is useless in the dark or even just when the other person is not looking at you is superior to a spoken language.And which is the best way to test guns? By shooting them, because 10-15 years old or older guns with out any kind of maintenance never blow up in your face when you try to shoot them.And then the apes learn to use the guns and they shoot literally thousands of rounds without ever reloading. No need to reload in wonderland... I, personally had one year of training for my military service, and I am still not sure how to use a weapon I was not trained with but hey I m not an ape!A lot more stupidity from the writers and finally, the human warns the apes that the army is coming to wipe them out, but the ape leader which through the entire movie is depicted as intelligent, moderate and cautious does not order to hide in the woods. Instead he stays in the city waiting for the army.The characters are a joke, especially the bad guys, and generally don't spend any money on this if you are over 16 years old. Don't watch it altogether if you are under 16 years old because it is full of stupid and meaningless violence...",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Really appreciated the way that the film questions your loyalty to the human race, and plays on your emotion in this way. Ceasar was played very well. I personally rate this film higher than the batman movies, as I feel it had more strings to its bow. All the action, as well as great visuals, and deep meaning!

The character of Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) remind me of British people who came to India in early part of 16th century and requested Indians to allow them to trade.

The whole film is moving, inspirational and intriguing. Everything I look for to be able to enjoy a film and to say I enjoyed this would be an understatement. There is a mixture of sad scenes, artistic scenes and uplifting ones. There wasn't one moment I was bored or looking away from the screen. The opening scene helped with this as it sums up the film completely and puts it in motion.When the film was over, I was gutted and would have happily watched it again! As soon as I got home, I watched clips of my favourite scenes (MANY) and the making of the film. This, however, was unintentional seeming as this isn't the sort of thing I am normally in to but just like the film, I couldn't stop watching them... I was amazed. Now, I couldn't write a review of the film without mentioning the superb performances from Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbel. They were brilliant and without them, the film wouldn't have been as exceptional! I really do urge you to go and see this film as no matter what, you will enjoy it.

I expected the movie to lack character just as I would any movie that was largely CGI, or computer-generated imagery. Man, did it exceed my expectations. The introduction of the plot and the conflict left no questions to be asked, but didn't overload the viewer with too many important details. The characters were so incredibly well-developed despite the fact that all of them were each uniquely different. What a marvelous job by the writers developing the characters of the apes given that they couldn't speak that much. Because of the lack of spoken dialogue between the apes, the writers really had to make the viewer empathize with the apes and their amazingly human qualities. The plot lacked almost nothing. It hooked me from the beginning and kept tugging at my different emotions all throughout the movie, from anger, to pity, and even sadness.

However when this got a 5 star rating from various reviewers, I decided I would actually go to the movie theater. What a waste of time. Sitting next to one of my friends, I could guess what was going to happen before it happened, literally, throughout the movie.There were multiple to name, however, but there were two that struck me as the most cliché, and forced me out of the cinema to take a toilet break (which I never do when watching a movie at the cinema). The first was when the power was turned back on and the horrible acting protagonists moved to a store which is know overrun by trees and vegetation. A guy puts on a song and I said to my friend, ""If they start dancing, I'm leaving."" I subsequently left. Another cliché (and extremely annoying) moment was when the main human (somehow not Gary Oldman who had about 4 minutes screen time!) had to run back to get Caeser some supplies (he'd been shot) and I guessed, ""hey, Caeser's son who is the only ape against the new leader not tied up for loyalty, will meet him and ignore him"".

It's racist in more ways than one, they are trying to say black people are like monkeys, and white people are meek and cowardly. and it's also terrible, they are trying to push some Hollywood agenda.

Before I begin about the metaphor, I must say that this movie, as well as the prequel (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) really drew me in emotionally. I found myself becoming attached to the characters and and feeling their every emotion as something joyous or tragic would occur. At times I would even find myself at the verge of tears, and I don't cry much. Now for the metaphor. I believe this movie was so believable because of the realistic situations apes and humans had to deal with. They were so afraid and foreign to each other that their fear led to war. This is why many wars in the past have occurred. From fear and differences. Why were the apes and humans afraid of one another? Because they wanted safety for their families and themselves, as does everyone in the world today. By the end of the movie, Caesar realizes that apes and humans aren't so different after all. He thought apes were better at first, but found that both apes and humans share a similar culture and similar values.

Unfortunately, this was not the case...Don't get me wrong, the movie is not all bad. Special effects are OK, there are fights, a bit of sentiments here and there, and basis feelings (sadness, happiness, anger, etc..) but nothing new.There are the good humans, the bad humans...there are the good apes and the bad apes. The bads want to fight, the good don't want. That's how I would sum this up. If I believe I will always remember the 1968 original movie, I will definitely not remember what happened in that one in more than 2 months from now. Simply because nothing extraordinary happen. I mean a 10 years old could have written this story. So if you had to read this as a book....Oh my! Already these 2 hours seem pretty long...To sum up: if you want some good Hollywood action, fights, explosions, cascade and basic usual bad/good fights and feelings, that might be OK.

Well, from my personal point of view, I didn't see any 3D. Maybe a little bit when the apes look down at the humans from a higher point, but in general 3D doesn't do it for me. It's not worth the extra money. At the beginning the apes come to the city and say something like : ""Apes do not want war, but we will fight!"". At that exact point the movie was over for me, apes and humans can live peacefully together, no need to seek out confrontations. How the movie progressed after that was very illogical for me.And why would you use sign language if you can talk!!The CGI is not bad, but the posture of the apes didn't seem to real to me. Apes riding horses with a straight back i.e. Evolution doesn't happen over night. If I was one of those motion capture actors, I'd go study chimp behavior and body language.Why does a chimp rule over all other apes? Including gorilla's? Isn't it ""survival of the strongest""? Isn't a gorilla heavier and stronger than a chimp?The longer I think about it, the worse my opinion gets of this movie.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It was simply an amazing movie full of sentiment, family unity/trust, and the many hardships that basic survival can arise. In Caesar, you have a complex being full of depth who simply wants to exist in peace and provide for his loved ones and community. But as history has shown, life is often one tragic story full of violence, deception, and sorrow. Yet hope, if truly sought and fought for, can also exists behind all that shadow and horror. As Caesar so profoundly put it ""ape started war, but human don't forget"" and these words could not be any more valid, especially during these dark times. With all their complexities, humans still do remain the most violent and treacherous of beasts. Go see DoTPoTA. You will not regret it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Especially the Gary Oldman character.The only thing good about this movie are the effects, i.e. the apes. Don't know how they made actors into apes. Probably lots of computer added technology.Storyline is not finished, no problem there ,but could have been much better.More detail to storyline would have made the end result better for viewing.At the end I was longing to see the original Planet of the Apes film ,from 1968,starring Chalton Heston.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

On the other hand the ape community lives peacefully under the leadership of Caesar (Andy Serkis). However the peace doesn't last for long as the humans (after having used up all the other energy sources) come upon their home to reactivate a dam nearby leading to friction between the two communities. Although Caesar and some humans such as Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and his wife want to coexist and live peacefully, due to various interesting twists in the plot, war becomes unavoidable. The movie has outstanding CG and action sequences. There are scenes which are entirely CG shots but feel so incredibly real that you would not believe that they are computerized. This has been complemented with strong storytelling and phenomenal screenplay. The performances by the actors are outstanding. Overall the movie is a must-watch.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
655,kerrylcc,Great all-round movie,9,5 October 2014,"I was hooked! The CGI effects were stunning. However, it was rather disconcerting to see apes riding horses. There were absolutely brilliant action scenes. Some were particularly well shot like the tank sequence turning round to reveal the battle scene. This movie makes you think about what it means to be human. It blurs the line between humans and apes that you no longer think of them as primates anymore but rather as non-humans. I had fun in the scenes trying to identify who was actually ape and human based on their behaviour. Each were capable of love and terrible violence, the emotional range having already been established in the first movie. That being said, I felt the non-humans had many more and deeper emotional scenes than those of the humans. One reason being that given the non-humans limited vocabulary, everything they say came across more powerful.9/10 rotten bananas.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Obviously the writers copied some parts of ""The Lion King"" but even there they totally failed. I was happy to leave the cinema because with every minute the story got worse.The design of the characters of Jason Clarke and Keri Russell was as bad as their acting. And can somebody tell me what was the part of Kodi Smit-McPhee in the movie? They were even able to waste Gery Oldman. Just think about the last scene Gery Oldman had - one of the worst moments in the movie ... i mean what did the director and writers think when they did this scene?!?However i blame the writers most because they managed to transform a good idea and atmosphere into a 0815-movie.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Now, Torres is a an awesome striker, but he's famous with frustrating misses and Matt Reeves is imitating him with this film. Don't get me wrong, ""Dawn"" is a great movie. Andy Serkis keeps pushing the limit on what a human face can do and he appears to be the one who uses it best. We're a total waste of faces guys :)We also have the emotional depth of multiple apes and not just one like in ""Rise"". The human side of the conflict is also very good with great performances from Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman.However, the story and plot are old and not original at all like it was with ""Rise"" and the technology, while it carries serious advancement, but I don't feel like it was used to its full potential, especially the 3D, which we could've totally done without.My video review for the movie in Arabic can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=sSt5M9Pxf6A",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Well developed technology destroys human beings themselves, apes rise just according the way human rose in the ancient times. Is there any implication that apes will run on the old way of human beings? or the movie just want to tell us we are now overdeveloped, we need to stop, back to a primary level? By the way,Caesar is good indeed, but do we need our Caesar? Worship to Caesar from apes(actually the worship may be from humans) in the movie makes me feel not good.

659,vedanthize,A Breath-taking gritty sequel to a gritty reboot !!! A must watch.,10,19 September 2014,"'Rise of the planet of the apes' was a refreshing new take on the well loved franchise, and the sequel, Dawn of the planet of the apes, totally lives up to the first, if not more. Director Matt Reeves took meticulous care to create a brilliant and realistic film with detailed and visually spell binding shots.The story line picks up ten years after the first film with the virus outbreak which was triggered in the first film, killing of most of the human population. Ceasar,played brilliantly by Andy Serkis(somebody give him an award: there has to be one for brilliant motion capture) and his fellow homo simians find sanctuary in the woods near San Francisco and form their own little flourishing culture and society with school and caste order. The other cast are not ones that stays in your head and are often forgotten once you leave the cinema hall. The length was perfect. A little to much and they would have overshot it and a little too less would have left us asking for more . When it comes to the use of CGI, detail and animation displayed here almost fooled me to believe that i was watching real apes. Michael Giacchino's haunting musical score immerses you into the drama and conflict. The action of 'Dawn' is not your usual film but is a realistic portrayal with more darker tones.Some of the visual shots make you shout (spoilers!)""Et tu brute"" and you can relate it with Julius Ceasar . To summarize, Dawn is a gritty sequel to a gritty reboot and is one of the few films to live up to its expectations.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
660,newabhijit,War can only bring destruction/ Amazing father and son love story,9,14 October 2014,"Watched it after 2 months of release and I love the way the story is been explained. People say its predictable but the movie has shown the true color of human nature. It shows how hatred can bring war and war can bring destruction. The father and son story of Ceasar and his son was heart touching. Its probably the best ape movie ever. I already loved the first two parts of the movie. I would recommend it as a sensible family entertainment. For me it is the superhero Ceasar I wanted to watch. It doesn't show what happens to Ceasar and his Ape family. The scene which gave me goosebumps is when Koba said ""Ape don't kill apes"" just to survive and Ceasar killed him saying ""Ape don't kill apes, but you are not ape"".",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
661,nico_draux08,Dawn of planet of the apes,8,25 October 2014,"Dawn of planet of the apes is action/ post apocalyptic film which has as director Matt Reeves. Main actors are Judy Greer ( Cornélia ), Gary Oldman ( Dreyfus ), Keri Russell ( Ellie ), Jason Clarke ( Malcolm )and Andy Serkis as César. Ten years after the beginning of the "" simian flu "", most of people are dead. In San Francisco, a group of survivors wants to find others survivors around the world. For that, they have to reach an hydroelectric factory which is on the apes's estate. Those ones, with César as leader, are afraid from humans. A war will start.. In my opinion, this is a gripping and dazzling film. The post- apocalyptic atmosphere is perfectly done, the acting and special effects are incredible ( For example, we can see the fear into the eyes of apes,.. ) In the other hand, when the movie stops ( even if it is not a real end because it's the first film of trilogy ), you just want to see it again because the plot is really immersive and taking.

662,nikgonzales13,A Must See Film,9,31 October 2014,"The movie, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a must see film. Continuing off where the first movie, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" left off, Caesar struggles with humans trespassing on his land. The movies jaw-dropping action, real-life graphics, and emotion given to the apes, makes this cinema out of this world. Although there weren't many big battle scenes, it made up for it with little bits of scuffles between a human and ape. This allowed the viewer to get a sense of why things happened the way it did by showing a time line of events leading up to the disgust between the two species. Ultimately, it lead to one huge battle. Guns, explosions, screaming, you name it, it had it all. The sudden attacks made you jump from your seat making you want more. The intenseness and sorrow you feel for the helpless apes and humans make you sympathize for both sides. The movie made it hard for you to root for one side as both sides were at fault for this battle. The movie's amazing graphics and art gives extra life to the movie. The trees, birds, and apes were almost realistic. The way the apes moved and acted were just like a real ape would have. It was evident that the director spends a great deal of time making it seem as realistic as possible. The biggest thing that made this movie a hit was the emotion given to Caesar. Being an ape you wouldn't think he could react to things like a human would, but that's not the case in this movie. Caesar's wife is on the brink of dying and you could sense the sadness in Caesar's eyes. His emotion was a key element in the movie because it's his feelings that prompt him to save his family and try to make peace. The vivid detail is to die for, the acting was sensational, and the story is great. This movie deserves to be up there with the past ape movies for sure. It has everything you could ask for in a movie. If you haven't seen it yet, get up and go watch it.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I was particularly impressed with the way the humans left their entire arsenal guarded by just two idiot drunks. There are so many jarring ""what the hell"" moments to mention.I couldn't bring myself to sit through the whole film. This is pretty unusual for me.Yes, this is my first review, inspired by this films high rating and how bad it actually was. Please don't waste your time.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
664,nbt315,enjoyable film but too easy to predict the plot,7,8 November 2014,"** This may contains spoiler**Firstly I must admit that the CGI in this movie was magnificent, from the tiny sweat drop, face structure, facial expression, everything almost like they were filming real animal. Acting was good, characters had their own part to develop, each had their own depth, good and bad. For those only, the movie was pretty much a good movie for me to watch. However, the plot, for me was a bit of turn down from the 1st one. With the hatred of Koba and Caesar human's love conflict, i was pretty much can guess the ending of the movie after 15-20 mins of watching. Apes, from being a victims of human experiment, now developed hatreds, holding grudge toward human. For me, it was pretty much human-like, not apes. They hate human i agree, but from hate to Koba-like cunning, plotted a very cunning plan to blame human for what they didn't do, well, i don't think that would suit the role of Apes. Apes, they fight for their survivors, as well as human, but only human should have revenges, because of Simian Flu that cost most of human life on earth, and now it surprise me that we- human didn't want to wipe out of all those apes on earth. The movie fall into the trend of making human being a good soul, despite we suffer lots of lost and damages, in fact, we human sometime can be worst than animal. I was hoping for the plot where Koba didn't shoot Caesar, but some human did, and left that rifle at the scene, to make a plot twist when human will sacrifice some of their men, to create a cause and conflict then force apes to attack the human base, in order to protect apes home. And the from that reason, human make a come back to try wipe all apes out, therefore, war starts and once again, apes are the innocent victim of human's greed. The last scene where Caesar and Malcolm holding hands and talk about who start wars first, well, it should be human who make things worse, not apes.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

Even ""Unevolved"" apes would be able to do better than that.One can only suspend reality up to a point, and this film goes way beyond that point, you'd need to be completely brain dead to appreciate this tripe.Well, that's a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

If I didn't have to write ten lines to give you this warning it would be done. The CGI was mildly interesting but the story was pathetic. If you want a good apes dose watch the Chuck Heston version! What a waste of money goes into this CGI dribble. I wonder what's going on in Hollywood. I love movies but it seems that most movies are remakes of the stuff I grew up with in the 70's and 80's. Where is the creativity? Obviously if these remakes generate revenue..you have a fairly simple formula to make cash... go with what was popular and cast trendy stars. The world is full of creative people. Take risks and invest in the hungry artists! The current state of affairs falls far short of true representation of the artistic and creative talent that is everywhere else around us in this privileged world. Wake up Hollywood!!,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
667,dagimz8,Good cinematography and worst climax resolution.,3,10 December 2014,"I recently saw "" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" and was very admired by the movie storyline. I have enjoyed the first part of this film and it was excellently done. It is a movie that mixes action, comedy and sci-fi genres. The storyline picks up ten years after we saw Andy Serkis (Ceasar) and his fellow simian escapees seek refuge in the woods near San Francisco, and although the film's trailers already gave away pretty much everything that happened during that time. The apes in the movie have the best character to express their emotions.One of the main reasons that I really like this movie is that the actors contributed a very hard work and excellence job to represent the character that the movie needs. This movie has the best actors like Andy Serkis being the male lead who has a good passion to play and accomplish his part. Gary Oldman do not disappoint the way he plays his role. Keri Russell is magnificent and obviously beautiful throughout the film.Ten years after the worldwide deadly virus ALZ, the human civilization is completely destroyed. In San Francisco, (Andy Serkis)Caesar has become the leader of evolved apes and has a son, Nick Thurston(Blue Eyes). When Blue Eyes and his friend Ash stumble with a group of humans under the command of Malcolm and there is a friction between them. However, Caesar orders them to return to the derelict San Francisco City. Then he goes with a group of apes to tell them that they do not want war against the human, despite the hatred of his second in command (Toby Kebbell)Koba against humans. However Malcolm returns alone to the woods to meet Caesar to explain that they need to repair the hydroelectric dam to recover power in the city to save the survivors. Caesar accepts his argument and let him work with his family and a few technicians in the dam. Meanwhile the leader of the humans (Gary Oldman)Dreyfus decides to arm the survivors since he does not believe in the apes. However Koba wants the war against mankind and he provokes a situation of intolerance and consequent war.It looks amazing for starters, the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and atmosphere and the scenery is equally striking. But the visual highlights, and most likely the best thing about the film, are the special effects for the apes, that they look so real and that it's hard to believe that computer did them and it is a testament to how good they look.I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in ""the real world"" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in ""Rise"", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.There is also the misunderstandings and the distrust between the two sides, for while they are told to discard their weapons, there is one that always has to ignore the request due to the fear that by discarding their weapons they open themselves up to being attacked and being defenseless. Of course there are those who are always looking for a peaceful solution, trying to work together, however the peaceful ones are always being undermined by the war mongers, who for some reason seem to have the loudest voices. Despite the actors great performance the main storyline led to an epic fail which made the movie pointless, meaningless and horrible.Finally, the movie was done by the best actors who did their part in an outstanding way. The cinematography of the movie has used the latest technology and it also has a nice setting. Despite all this, the climax of the movie had a terrible way of resolving itself.The reviewer is an undergraduate student at China.

668,josh-shaffe,"Visuals, Tension, and Ape Characters Highlight in a Memorable Planet of the Apes Entry",7,1 January 2015,"Picking up ten years after the events of the first entry, 2011's Rise, in the Planet of the Apes reboot series, Dawn wastes no time in catching the audience up with what has occurred since the last film. The opening scenes effectively set the stage in both plot and tone, and we are quickly introduced to the key players in this film. In fact, this aspect of the film is perhaps both its greatest strength and partial downfall. Most of the plot and events in Dawn move at a fast pace, and rarely is a moment wasted. Every step is deliberate, and as a result, the audience may feel the movie's guiding hand. Predictability runs rampant, but this does not result in Dawn's downfall.The key features that help lift this movie above the average blockbuster titles are its style, realistic character reactions, and strong ape characters. Style-Dawn is a visual wonder, both in its incredible use of CGI and art direction. Many people could probably enjoy the film solely as eye candy. Here the cinematography shines with notable and memory worthy shots sprinkled throughout. All of this is supported by a worthy tension filled score that effectively builds on the visual aspects.Realistic Character Reactions-I note this aspect due to a trend in films I've noticed where characters act unrealistically compared to their personality only for plot purposes. Few of the humans or apes are solely caricatures and each react in a realistic manner based on their motives. As a result, the plot is influenced by their actions, not the other way around.Strong Ape Characters-The apes really shine in this story (not entirely unexpected) and many are truly memorable. Much of the enjoyment to derive from this film comes from witnessing how this fledgling society reacts to its first true external and internal conflict.Pitfalls-The humans characters are basically unremarkable. While none are painted as simple villains or good guys and their actions are understandable, it's hard to relate beyond plain empathy for their situation. -The plot direction becomes predictable towards the third act. In many ways the film takes the safe route, and the final scenes really only resonate due to our already developed connections to the characters in play. -Imagery and metaphors are sometimes too blatant. While I personally enjoy the use of apes to reflect our human society, I understand that many audience members may find some of the imagery and metaphors too heavy handed.ConclusionDawn of the Planet of The Apes should definitely be remembered as a highlight of film in 2014. While not without its shortcomings, the film is a visual marvel and an enjoyable take on a newborn ape society. The constant and effective tension and emotional resonance is more than enough to keep the audience engaged in the movie's story while further building a strong foundation for later installments. Overall, Dawn is one of the better entries into the Planet of the Apes franchise while also being an enjoyable film in its own right.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
669,ernestmverano,A total nonsense which is divorced from reality,2,13 January 2015,"Although I have seen all the movies in the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, I always thought that the scenario that Earth will be taken over by apes is a nonsense and totally contrary to the known physiology of apes and humans. First, the scenario in this movie that a single simian flu epidemic would kill almost all the humans and lead to the blink of human extinction is not epidemiologically sound. Human gene pool is so diverse that there is a large percentage of humans who are highly resistant to any epidemic. That is why no epidemic in human history has killed humans like the simian flu as portrayed in this movie. This means that hundreds of millions, if not billions, of humans will be immune or recover from the simian flu epidemic. If apes try to take over the world, there will be hundreds of millions, if not billions, of human survivors who are ready to fight the apes with all the modern weapons. Second, the scenario in the movie that apes can wage effective wars against humans is biologically unrealistic. As all of us know, long distance traveling capability is crucial for offensive military campaigns. Bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans do not have the stamina to travel long distance. Their hairy bodies have a tendency to overheat and their knuckle walking posture make it very exhausting to walk long distance. A young adult chimpanzee typically moves only about one to two miles per day and the upper limit of chimpanzee's traveling capability is slightly less than 10 miles per day. Therefore, apes, which become exhausted after traveling only ten miles, make really lousy soldiers for offensive campaigns. In contrast, many humans—even out of shape ones—can run long distance. Some can run marathon or even longer than 100 kms. This makes us much better soldiers for offensive campaigns. (The movie's scene in which apes were traveling in the woods for miles and miles like flying ninjas is a total hogwash.)Third, although the very high intelligence of humans is the main factor behind the fact that there are seven billion humans spread throughout Earth while only half a million apes are confined to relatively small areas in Africa and Asia, there is another crucial biological factor which favored human proliferation. Humans are much more prolific than apes. A typical chimpanzee or orangutan female can become pregnant every four to five years (sometimes every three years) and the female is fertile for only twenty years of its life span. Just like humans, ape females usually give birth to only one baby per birth. Therefore, a typical ape female gives birth to five to six babies (sometimes seven) in its life span. Only about 3 to 4 of these babies survive to adulthood. However, a human female can become pregnant every ten to eleven months. She can stay fertile up to forty years of her life span. (A human female can stay fertile longer because most humans have much longer life spans than most apes.) Therefore, a human female can potentially give birth to fifty babies in her life time and a human female is potentially almost ten times as prolific as a typical female ape. Of course, giving birth to 50 or more babies is very, very rare but giving birth to 10 to 20 babies is not and has not been very rare in many present and past human societies. As we all know, there are and were numerous parents with more than 10 kids. If humans can secure ample amount of food supplies and proper habitats, there will be many, many more humans than apes within only several generations. Under such a circumstance, humans can overwhelm apes by sheer number within several generations. Fourth, I also found the portrait of most humans in this movie as weak, cowardly, docile, unprepared, and complacent to be totally unrealistic. I am sure that many humans are cowardly and unprepared. However, most humans, by nature, are more violent, paranoid, and vigilant than the pathetic portrayal in the movie. Under a crisis situation like a near human extinction and total collapse of order, most humans will try to guard against other humans from robbing and killing them. Therefore, almost all humans will become very, very vigilant, prepared, and suspicious. No human colony (unlike the feeble-minded San Francisco colony in the movie) will keep weapons in a remote armory which is guarded by several stupid drunks and totally rely on a weak leader like the one portrayed by Gary Oldman. Each person will have an underlying paranoia and keep their weapons handy 24 hours a day and even sleep with his or her weapons. This is obvious from recent historical precedents. For instance, even in a lesser crisis like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, many citizens became paranoid and turned into armed vigilante groups, who jealously guarded their neighborhoods from looters. Moreover, since every adult males and females of a colony is a potential soldier, the governing body of a colony will most likely mandate each citizen to keep his or her weapon handy all the time so they can fight within a moment of notice. The portraits of post-Apocalyptic human colonies in the Matrix and Terminator or even Mad Max series were much more realistic. The humans in those series were vigilant, resilient, violent, courageous, and enterprising. Although not all of us are like that, didn't we become the masters of this planet due to our courage, vigilance, and initiative? I do not think we could have conquered Earth and maintained the control over the planet by just being a bunch of cowards like in this movie. In conclusion, this movie is a nonsensical fantasy, which is based on ignorance of human psychology and ape physiology. Not all works of fiction have to be 100% realistic. However, when its plot deviates so much from reality, a movie stinks to the heavens.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

It shows a surviving human colony too who struggle to survive until their power goes out. A troop goes about and begs Caesar if they could stay and build fix the generator, meanwhile the Rise of the Ape Tyrant Koba is taking place.

671,ltoledo23,Much More Than Just a Typical Summer Blockbuster,8,12 July 2014,"I thought this movie was superior for a summer blockbuster. It was well acted, the motion capture (all apes were motion capture) was superb, and there were some truly wonderful shots.In terms of acting the humans, Jason Clarke, Keri Russell, Gary Oldman, etc.. were all very good. Nothing that screams awards but very good. The stars of the show were Andy Serkis (Caesar) and Toby Kebbel (Koba). Serkis will once again create a debate as to whether a stop action performance is worthy of award consideration. Kebbel should be part of this conversation, for a supporting role, as well.The motion capture was fantastic. The apes jumped off the screen. There is nothing more that can be said except that at this point ""Dawn"" should sweep all special effects awards at all the awards shows. Granted, there are other movies coming out later this year which could change things. But, at this points ""Dawn"" is ""THE"" high water mark for motion capture. The highest compliment I can give is that the Apes looked real. Also meriting high praise was the cinematography at times. There wide shots of the apes running in large groups that were breathtaking. But, the stand out shots were to long, static shots that used fire as framing devices. One involves Koba on horseback galloping through fire and the other a shot of raging apes in a village with a raging fire framing the whole thing. Both shots were fabulous and one gets completely lost in them. The battle scenes were not awe inspiring, except for aforementioned Koba scene, but they were very intense and well choreographed and shot.Lastly, I am not one who feels it necessary to find negatives to give a sense of balance. If there were none, or at least worth mentioning, I would not. Here however, it must be mentioned that the pacing is off at times. Simply put, the movie drags or is ""too slow"" at times. Thus, it leaves one feeling that the movie was too long.7.5/10",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
