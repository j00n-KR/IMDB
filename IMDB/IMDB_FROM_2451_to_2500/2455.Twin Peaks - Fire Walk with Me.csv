0,MartinHafer,Rather unnecessary....at least for me.,3,11 July 2017,"""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" is a film made just after the TV series ""Twin Peaks"" and covers material leading up to the beginning of the first episode of the series. The show begins with a different FBI agent (Chris Isaac) investigating the death of Teresa Banks...a year before Laura Palmer was killed by the same perpetrator. This, and a brief appearance by Kyle McLaughlen, make up the beginning portion which lasts about 20 minutes. The rest consists of seeing Laura Palmer during the final week of her life.So why did I say in the summary that it was rather unnecessary? Well, this is because there weren't any surprises....after seeing the series you know who Bob is and because of this I didn't see a lot of reason for the film. Plus, although Lara Flynn Boyle refused to appear in the movie, she was a very important character and it's obvious that Moira Kelly is NOT Boyle. Finally, the film is much grittier than the series. You couldn't show the nudity and extreme violence of the film in the TV series....but, for me, I did NOT need to see Laura's breasts or all the blood. Sorry....just didn't get a lot out of this one...even though I did enjoy the series.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
1,TheLittleSongbird,David Lynch's most underrated film,8,15 November 2014,"Not Lynch at his best(that would be Blue Velvet, though personal favourite is The Elephant Man), it is a very good film and should please fans of the TV series, even if darker in tone and lacking the show's humour. Lynch's films may be strange, unconventional and not always easy to understand for some, but all of them are visually striking, dynamically scored and with great performances, atmosphere and direction as well as working amazingly as mood pieces and being among the most unique films in existence- the only film of his that I didn't care for was Dune, was mixed on Inland Empire too but that still had a lot of the above components.Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me may not be as good as the TV series but did not deserve the negative reception it got at the time. The few flaws it has has nothing to do with being darker and lacking the show's humour, they are not even flaws. David Bowie did stick out like a sore thumb and to me was embarrassingly bad(though a lot of it was to do with how his character was written) but the film's biggest flaw was that you could tell that it was originally written as a much longer film, with so much truncated there were parts where things felt under-explained and incomplete, a longer length would have helped(personal opinion of course and not one other people will share).Coming onto however what was good about Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, the film does everything else right. As said before, Lynch's films are always visually great, and to say that Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me looks great visually is not enough. The film in fact has wonderfully moody cinematography and lovingly designed sets, while the surreal imagery looks so mesmerising that regardless of whether the story confuses you you cannot possibly look away. Lynch's direction as ever is impeccable, his style unmistakable and the haunting soundtrack draws you in effortlessly. The story won't be everyone's cup of tea, I did find myself completely engrossed and found it along with Sophie Scholl: The Final Days one of the most powerful films personally seen in a while. Sure, it did feel under-explained and incomplete in parts but it never bored me and like every other Lynch film as a mood piece it's amazing. Parts were incredibly intense and shocking(the most intense parts making for one of the most disturbing films there is) but others were genuinely emotional as well. Regarding individual scenes in a film where one hypnotic scene follows another, the strobe-lit disco degradation stuck out in particular.Apart from Bowie, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is very well-acted, Sheryl Lee is superb and at times heart-breaking as an easy-to-root-for character while Ray Wise is just terrifying as one of the scariest father figures on film. Harry Dean Stanton, Kiefer Sutherland and Kyle MacLauchlan are on fun form too. In conclusion, a very under-appreciated film and undeservedly so. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
2,SnoopyStyle,freaky David Lynch prequel,5,31 July 2016,"FBI regional chief Gordon Cole (David Lynch) sends agents Chet Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland) to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks in Deer Meadow. Agent Desmond disappears and Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is sent but he comes to a dead end. One year later, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and her friend Donna Hayward (Moira Kelly) are attending Twin Peaks high school. Laura is a troubled drug-addicted girl haunted by a mysterious Bob.This is mostly for fans of the TV show. It probably wouldn't make sense for people who haven't seen the show. It may not all make sense for those who have either. David Lynch continues to let his freak flag fly as his TV show devolves into meandering randomness in the second season. It has many of the same characters except Moira Kelly is playing Donna Hayward. In the first case, Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland don't add up to anything compelling. Kyle MacLachlan gets a small cameo. I don't know if it's Sheryl Lee's performance but Laura Palmer is a bit of a disappointment. The TV show builds her up to be this iconic figure and I doubt anything could have satisfied. It's almost impossible to fulfill. This is not for everybody and may not be compelling even for fans of the TV show. It's weird. It's a bit slow especially with the expectation of its eventual ending. There is no mystery or thrills but it's weirdly entrancing.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
3,Hitchcoc,Fills in Some Spaces,7,28 July 2017,"I don't have much to say that is new. First of all, this whole Lynch milieu is about as crazy and enjoyable as anything I've ever seen. I've said before and I'll say it again, I believe that Lynch wakes up from a nightmare and writes a screenplay. This gives us insight into what was Laura Palmer. When I began watching the new series, I was confused, primarily because I had seen this film many years ago. I love the surrealism and the supernatural essence of the movie, but because there are moments of reality mixed in, the pregnant pauses, the transmigration of souls and all that, it is even more fun. Anyway, what I need to do now is check out the later episodes of the initial series.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
4,Prismark10,Coffee not that darn good,6,17 October 2014,"Twin Peaks ended on a cliffhanger. The film Fire Walk With Me was an opportunity to resolve what happened to Agent Cooper.Instead we get a prequel on the last days of Laura Palmer until her demise but hold on we knew what happened to Laura Palmer because we watched the TV series.Maybe Kyle Maclachlan demanded more money or was reluctant to appear in the film which lead to a drastic change reducing his role to a cameo.Director David Lynch starts the film brightly with his trademark surreal and silly scenes and sounds, in fact the first scene is of a television set being smashed as if the director is telling us this is a departure from the TV show. We have a focus on Kiefer Sutherland and Chris Isaak investigating an earlier murder. The cinematic film allows Lynch to be more darker and include more stronger sex and violence.The film kind of gets bogged down in the middle, the movie lacks some of the regulars from the TV serial who are sorely missed and some of the youngsters appearing are dull, wooden and in the case of James Marshall also beige. Sheryl Lee steps up to the mark however as Laura Palmer bringing a more rounded edge and tragedy to her character.The film is still frustrating, a missed opportunity to provide the answers you wanted when the show finished. Even Lynch could not pull off the prequel idea and you can only hope that newly announced continuation of Twin Peaks will lead to more satisfying story strands when we return there in 2016.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
5,Tweekums,Possibly the most surreal film I've seen,8,11 July 2012,"Having enjoyed the television series 'Twin Peaks' I was keen to see this as well as a little trepidations; could it possibly live up to the series? Now I have just finished watching it I'm not sure what to think; it was just that strange!The film doesn't open with the events in Twin Peaks but with the previous victim Teresa Banks; two FBI agents go to investigate her murder; one of them takes her body to Portland to be examined while the other stays being to ask a few more questions; this one then vanishes without a trace. Cooper is then put on the case. Moving forward a year the action heads to Twin Peaks where we see the final events leading up to the death of schoolgirl Laura Palmer.This may be set before the television series but it is best not to watch this first as it shows who killed Laura and that is the key mystery for most of the series it might be interesting to watch this before watching the series for a second time though. Since she died before the first episode Laura didn't feature much in the series but here she is the protagonist Sheryl Lee plays her once again and does a fine job depicting a girl who is terrified of what is happening around her but is powerless to stop it. Several cast members return although Donna is now played by Moira Kelly; she does a decent job but it is odd seeing somebody other than Lara Flynn Boyle in the role. Since no murder has been committed at the time we don't get to see any of the Sheriff's Department; nor do many other familiar faces.Many viewers may be surprised at just how strange this is, I certainly was! The opening scene sets the tone though when an FBI agent is given advice about his case by the appearance of a woman in a red dress she does not say a word; just makes a face and moves her hands a bit while walking on the spot! It isn't long before that seams positively normal there are visits to the Red Room which are not subtitled so it is hard to understand what is being said; there are similar difficulties during a long scene where loud music is played; this serves to increase the feeling of confusion; in a good way. It sounds a strange thing to say but I think I enjoyed this but I'll have to watch it again before I can be sure I'd recommend it to fans of Lynch's other works and fans of the series should definitely try it even if they might end up hating it!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
6,moonspinner55,Sinks deftly into the crawlspace between nightmares and reality...,6,30 July 2006,"Blistering account of insanity--surely meant for die-hard David Lynch addicts; all others are likely to get left behind. Lynch, the creator-director of the acclaimed late-'80s TV series ""Twin Peaks"", also helmed this critically-drubbed theatrical prequel, an expansive chronicle of lives in a sleepy lumber town, in particular a coked-up prom queen just before her mysterious demise. Fatuous indeed, but undeniably intense, amusingly weird and high-strung. Full of exaggerated rage, sex-obsessed characters, and hellish set-pieces. Sheryl Lee is terrific as doomed Laura Palmer, Ray Wise equally magnetic as her father. For all of its outrageousness, Lynch's finale is truly moving. This guy has some big talent--if only someone could persuade him to reel-in his more gruesome excesses, he might yet be more widely acclaimed as a film-making genius. **1/2 from ****",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
7,Quinoa1984,a fever dream that fans may or may not respond to; a flawed trip into the world of nightmares,7,16 April 2007,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is quite the perplexing film as both a David Lynch and Twin Peaks fan, because it's got qualities that should make for one of the best works of the director and doesn't really hit the mark. The problem, in a way, is somewhat comparable to the problem of Dune. There, Lynch's lack of control was something that made it a tough journey to go through, even as there was much to see as pure Lynchian cinema. Yet here with Fire Walk With Me it's almost an overwhelming notion of control that has him going way into a column of intriguing danger where pretension becomes a recognizable factor. It also doesn't help that the end result would benefit from being instead one crammed-in crammed as two. The story of Chester Diamond (Chris Isaak) and his disappearance while working on a Twin Peaks-related case has the makings for a much more interesting spin-off, where the universe is still intact that Lynch and company have created but has a whole different trajectory with the characters. Meanwhile, there's the detailed back-story of Laura Palmer's final days, and it's here that Lynch starts to lose his balance.Because Lynch and company made Laura Palmer a much more captivating and deliriously melodramatic force with pure, surrealistic overtones in the *past* tense on the show, seeing it unfold in present-tense time, with the singularly warped Palmer/Bob/father-daughter dynamic going loses its power. It might not for some; the bits where one can see why Lynch and Engels went into this excursion in the tale of Palmer are reminiscent of the best that Twin Peaks on TV had to offer; some of these are the dreams, like the re-appearance of the dwarf with ""I am the arm"" as a crucial, hilarious scene. But at the same time it almost feels exploitive, as a fan, and for newcomers to TP (which would be better if you're not in seeing this, unless you're up for a lot of upfront scenes of weird and wild characterization and style) the revelations feel a little more shallow and sensationalized for content purposes. All your favorite cast members are back, and in Phantom Menance style not really always with as much attention or depth as one could want or feel necessary.But then, was a Twin Peaks prequel necessary to begin with? This question, which can be a nagging one watching the film at times, has to be put aside for the fact that a prequel now exists and it is what it is. The perception of Fire Walk With Me is tricky because Lynch, Engels and company are not really about getting to deeper truths about the nature of mystery, evil's ongoing pervasive quality, and the subconscious, but in flaunting style (i.e. the nightclub scene, a likely inspiration for the one in Babel) as a means of going further and further with the ever-lurid, more HBO-than-Primetime story of Laura's downward spiral. It goes without saying that the line between psychological upheaval and mythology is tested to a degree of fascination as part of the whole creation of the 'Bob' myth and the Black Lodge themselves. This being said, it's sort of odd and all the same seeing Lynch try to get through a work that is almost too big, too personal, too abstracted, and nearly too easy as too much in a scheme of excess, as he's one of the few American filmmakers today who can create some watchable cinema- occasionally powerful and frightening- as it ironically doesn't work. I'd rather watch Lynch mess something up than a far more deliberate attempt from a Hollywood director.Perhaps a late night viewing sometime may change my mind at some point in the future, as will more contemplation in general about what the darks side of Twin Peaks has to offer as opposed to the more light (if 'light' is the word to use) scenes and well-rounded cast of eccentrics. There's even a noteworthy turn by the film's leading lady, Sheryl Lee, and a wonderfully outrageous dream sequence involving Cooper and some random southern guy played by David Bowie. Nevertheless, FWWM is a slight, disappointing trip, and not up to par with the standard, however high, set by the show as a whole.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
8,sunwarrior13,A Great Horror Film By David Lynch,9,29 December 2014,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me is a psychological horror film that serves as both the prologue and epilogue to the television series Twin Peaks,that was created by scriptwriter and director David Lynch together with Mark Frost.The story revolves around the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks and the last seven days into the life of Laura Palmer,a popular high school student in the fictional town called Twin Peaks located at Washington.The movie stars Sheryl Lee, Moira Kelly,David Bowie,Chris Isaak,Harry Dean Stanton,Ray Wise and Kyle MacLachlan. This is definitely one of the masterpieces created by David Lynch.It has an unconventional storytelling techniques that will definitely be appreciated by viewers from all ages.Added to that,the moments of horror that the movie has are definitely far from the typical horror films for they are far from being typical as they are strange and Lynch made them new and groundbreaking.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
9,preppy-3,Even for David Lynch this is pretty disturbing,7,5 July 2008,"A prequel to the cult TV series ""Twin Peaks"". It chronicles the last week in the life of teenager Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). She's beautiful and popular...but there's a lot of disturbing things happening with her that people know nothing about. In the TV series it was hinted at or talked about--in this movie it's in your face and pretty disturbing. Also the movie has bits and pieces showing the residents of the town that because regulars on the series.This movie had problems. The original cut was 5 hours long (!!!) and was cut down to 135 minutes. A lot of peoples subplots were reduced or eliminated entirely. It was booed when it played at the Cannes Film Festival and died at the box office here in the U.S. I can see why people didn't like this. It's dark, vicious, cruel and there's barely a let-up. Lee is in practically the entire film and she's just superb. She had an extremely difficult complex role which involved plenty of nudity, sex, drug taking and abuse. Her acting is so good it's hard to just shrug this movie off. Ray Wise as her father Leland matches her.DEFINITE SPOILER!!!! He's basically raping his daughter while possessed by an evil spirit called BOB. BOB is only in him at certain times. You literally see Wise's face and expression change when he's possessed or going back. That's gotta be hard but Wise pulls it off. END SPOILER!!!!The entire cast is good too--especially Dana Ashbrook and James Marshall. I loved it at first. Lynch keeps throwing images and bizarre dialogue at you and giving you just enough to figure it. But, halfway through, there's a bar sequence that goes on far too long and is extremely unpleasant. After that I started to get bored and disgusted. Lynch never stops and when it ends I felt drained. The acting, directing, music and everything is great here--but the dark tone and constant negativity really wore me down. I DO recommend it though--in a way. It challenges you and doesn't treat the audience like a bunch of idiots. How many movies can you say that about?""Wanna hear about our specials? We don't have any!""",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
10,poolandrews,"More abstract nonsense from Lynch, not my cup of tea at all.",3,24 December 2010,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me stats as FBI agents Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) & Sam Stanley (Keifer Sutherland) arrive in the small town of Deer Meadows to investigate the murder of waitress Teresa Banks. While searching the trailer park where Teresa lived Agent Desmond mysteriously disappears without trace. One year later & both the murder of Teresa Banks & the disappearance of Agent Desmond are unsolved. In the town of Twin Peaks a high school teenager named Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) seems like any other normal teen during the day but leads a life of sleaze & debauchery at night including prostitution in order to pay for her drug addiction but a tragic & horrifying fate awaits her...This French & American co-production was co-written, co-produced & directed by David Lynch this is in fact the third Lynch film I have seen recently & I have to say that his abstract & non-linear way of storytelling just doesn't appeal to me at all & I have a really hard time liking his films. Maybe I am not the best person to be writing a comment on Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me, as I said I don't like the director or his films, I have never seen any of the Twin Peak (1990 - 1991) TV series or even the Twin Peaks (1990) pilot episode so I was going into this blind. Having said that Twin Pekas Fire Walk with Me was meant to be a prequel to all the events of the TV series so in theory I shouldn't have needed to have watched the TV show but to be honest I'll be damned if I can work out half of what's going on in this. This is so abstract & strange that I am sure Twin peaks Fire Walk with Me will mean different things to different people, some like me will not get it at all & be throughly bored & frustrated by it while other's will undoubtedly buy into it & try & give every random occurrence some significance or try to examine every oddball moment & try to come up with some great symbolic meaning for them. To be honest I'm not into that, you can leave me out of it. I don't want to watch a two hour & fifteen minute film & then spend the next several days trying to work out what I just saw, life is too short. I won't try to pick apart Twin peaks Fire Walk with Me as it's narrative & imagery is so incoherent that it defies any rational examination or explanation of it.Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me looks nice enough for sure, having said that there are moments that leave you scratching your head. Child abuse is hinted at while prostitution, drug addiction & murder are all brought up. The first half an hour is actually quite good as it sets itself up as a murder mystery but once the film switches to Twin Peaks & Laura it becomes a bit of a bore as we wait for the inevitable. I suspect the murder of Laura Palmer is more interesting after it as dark secrets are uncovered in a bid to catch her killer rather than before it as we just see Laura swan around for a few days.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me was a critical & financial disaster which stopped any further planned sequels & stopped Lynch from making another film for five years. The acting is pretty good, everyone puts in a solid shift for sure but I can't say how the character's here relate to their TV counterparts as I have never seen the TV show, like I said.Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me is not the type of film that I like, to be fair I am not the right type of person to review it as a Twin Peaks or David Lynch fan might be better placed to understand it & offer some insight unlike me. However, as an ordinary bloke with simple tastes I can honestly say I didn't like this & at over two hours was a real chore to sit through for no great reward.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
11,gridoon2021,"Strikingly uneven prequel, guaranteed not to answer any of your questions!",6,4 September 2017,"In comparison to the 30-episode TV series, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" is approx. 130 minutes of pure, undiluted David Lynch weirdness. This means primarily two things: a) there is no soap-opera filler, b) it does not make a lick of sense. Some scenes have a hypnotic, trance-like power, but others are simply lethargic. The first section, which takes place outside of Twin Peaks, risks alienating viewers early (Chris Isaak's half-asleep performance is dreadful). The film is also surprisingly humorless; agent Cooper is barely in it, and he doesn't seem quite himself. And then there are the logistical problems, like the absence of the Hornes or Donna's unfortunate and unconvincing re-casting. As in the series, Ray Wise takes the acting honors, and Angelo Badalamenti's music is as beautiful as ever. **1/2 out of 4.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Flashbacks of that last week, and with the boyfriend, James (Marshall, also from the original.) all the strangeness and weird, wacky action from the series. Then we kind of forget about the agents. Odd splicing together. Directed by David Lynch, who had done so much of the original tv series. And also plays Gordon Cole. They made ANOTHER one in 2014, with more info on the same story.

13,lasttimeisaw,"an eerie, spine-tingling voyage into a cosmic myth",8,27 November 2017,"After completing all three seasons of TWIN PEAKS, the TV series, one's final closure is this cinema prequel, aka, the last days of Laura Palmer, made in 1992 after the first two reasons, and was intended to herald an expanding Black Lodge universe, which was ill-fatedly scrubbed after the film's dead-on-arrival reception. The meat of Twin Peaks story is affixed to a prologue taking place one year prior in a God-forsaken town Deer Meadow, where FBI agent Chester Desmond (Isaak) mysterious disappears when he tries to retrieve a lost ring belongs to the murder victim Teresa Banks (Gidley), which triggers the concern from FBI Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole (Lynch) and agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan), with the latter presciently foretells that another killing is imminent. The prologue gives us a glance of Lynch's original conception of its botched sequels, what happened to Agent Desmond, and the introduction of David Bowie's Special Agent Phillip Jeffires, who has gathered first-hand information about the eldritch rabbit hole, would have spirited us onto a Lynchian journey in another continent. Back to Twin Peaks, FIRE WALK WITH ME, is a watchword of Laura Palmer's (Lee) scourge, delineating roughly the last week of her life and pruning less pertinent threads, Lynch emphatically puts Laura under scrutinizing and Sheryl Lee gutsily takes it on herself to reify Laura's distraught psyche to a thoroughly haunting and transfixing effect, a vulnerable, terrorized, traumatized girl whose only rebellion against the creepy demon willing himself to overtake her is to give herself up to the complete abandon, when one's heart is dead, who cares about the body? It is a crying Oscar-caliber achievement goes criminally unsung, also Ray Wise stirringly amplifies his demonic impersonation of Laura's father, altogether, their effort speaks volume of what we habitually turn a blind eye on: incest and sexual abuse, human's original sin. Lynch's trademark nonsensical touches in the beginning gradually morph into a psychedelic horror (suffused with tawdry iridescence, exploitative nudity and nocturnal killing) when the film inches toward that bloody foregone conclusion peppered with frantic editing and benighted screaming. For Lynch's votaries, the movie is par for the course of earning the reputation as a film maudit, yet, assessed under a broader spectrum, as a singular piece, it still holds its own with Lynch's peculiar conceits pumped up in high voltage, an eerie, spine-tingling voyage into a cosmic myth, the puzzle is unsolved, but redemption elevates itself in the final shot, rest in peace, Laura Palmer, an angel mired in the temporal vice.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
14,Red-Barracuda,"A dark, strange and excellent prequel to the Twin Peaks series",10,17 August 2014,"It seems that when this prequel to the 'Twin Peaks' TV series was released in 1992 it didn't go down very well either critically or commercially. The series had been cancelled after season two a year beforehand so 'Twin Peaks' fever had died down considerably. Yet it seems that many of the fans of the show were disappointed with Fire Walk With Me anyway and I am guessing it was primarily for three reasons (1) it was tonally very different from the show - weirder, much harsher and more confrontationally disturbing, (2) it did not feature many of the loved characters from the series and (3) it did not resolve the cliff-hanger posed at the end of season two, instead it went back in time and detailed the last few days in the life of Laura Palmer. The latter reason was simply because director/creator David Lynch was most interested in the character of Laura Palmer and he wished to revisit her over and above anything else. Consequently, it's hardly surprising that the film only focuses on characters that were vital to Laura's last seven days, while the nature and reasons for her murder mean that the material was always going to be a lot more intense and disturbing. It's probably no coincidence that this film begins with a TV being smashed - from the outset it's clear that this is to be a definite re-imagining of the Twin Peaks universe.I myself am a big fan of Fire Walk With Me. It's much stranger than the series as well as being tougher. The freedoms of cinema allowed for this and TV was a great deal more restrictive content-wise back in the early 90's. On many occasions it goes very left-field and certainly does not explain all events in a neatly presented fashion. In this sense it ties in with much of Lynch's other film output. The weird moments are often very well executed and once more show the spectacular imagination of the man. But the bizarre aspects never take away from the basic story-line which does follow a linear path more or less. The story is at its heart a very dark and depressing one, after all it is largely about the systematic incestual sexual abuse of a young woman and her subsequent downward spiral. The surreal presentation adds considerable horror genre elements but distances us from the realistic true horror of the abuse. At this juncture it should be said that the acting of Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer) and Ray Wise (Leyland Palmer) is extremely impressive and a considerable step-up from the TV show. Lee is in most scenes and has a very wide range of emotions to convey, while Wise is simply terrifying as her abusive father.I am pleased that Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me has been enjoying something of a critical reassessment in recent years. It's so far on from Peaks mania that I think it's much easier to now see more clearly the strengths of this film. It fits into the filmography of Lynch extremely well and in many ways is one of his most interesting. As a finale to the 'Twin Peaks' phenomena it actually feels very apt and was a very satisfying way to finish things off.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
15,bensonmum2,"""The tender boughs of innocence burn first, and the wind rises, and then all goodness is in jeopardy.""",7,11 February 2005,"This film is essentially a prequel to the television series Twin Peaks. The movie begins one year before the television show with two FBI agents investigating the death of a waitress, Teresa Banks. After a half-hour, the focus of the movie switches to events that take place in the week that leads up to the murder of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). The events during the last week of Laura's life are filled with drugs, alcohol, and sex , and her murder is extremely brutal and violent. At this point, the television series begins. And things lighten-up quite a bit.The primary focus of the movie is the relationship between Laura Palmer and her father, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise). While Lee is adequate in the role of Laura, Wise excels at giving life to Leland. His ability to express emotion (fear, sadness, rage, etc.) is amazing, if not a little over the top. Another actor/character worth mentioning is Frank Silva as Bob. His character and performance are among the most frightening I've ever seen.As I said, Lynch has a lot of different things going on in the movie. Many are not really essential to the plot and could have, perhaps, been left out. For example, the first thirty minutes has almost nothing to do with what follows. Lynch could have shortened the movie to 90 minutes and made a tighter film that might have better appealed to an audience beyond the built-in television audience. In my mind, the ""padding"" contained in this movie is its greatest weakness.While the original television series presented life in a quirky town that could never exist in reality, the movie takes the bizarre nature of the town and stretches it to the point of non-believability. Take the scene with David Bowie as an example. He is seen walking down the hall at an FBI office and entering the office of his superior. As he gets halfway to the desk, he disappears. No one seems overly surprised - they act as if it is a normal part of the day.I was a huge fan of the television series during its initial run and was very excited when I first heard that Lynch was making this movie. While I enjoyed Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, I doubt I would have liked it nearly as much if I hadn't seen the series before I went to the theater. I don't think a non-fan of the show would have a clue about what was happening on screen.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
16,bowmanblue,Twin Peaks in name only,8,1 August 2014,"The TV series of Twin Peaks was widely regarded as 'monumental' and some of the most original TV-viewing ever made. However, it's second (and untimely last) season was dogged by cast in-fighting, schedule changes, production difficulties and network pressure to tell the writers what to writer. Therefore, it was cancelled, but left behind not only a lasting legacy among loyal fans, but also a 'cliff-hanger' ending which had Twin Peaks' followers begging for some sort of resolution.Therefore, many were pleased when a film was made straight away - everyone thinking it would pick up where the series left off. It didn't. And it paid the price.What the fans (and cinema audiences in general) got, was a darkened version of their beloved show which seemed to belong to a different story entirely. In short... 'Fire Walk With Me' couldn't win. It wasn't the 'ending' TV viewers were hoping for. And yet it relied heavily on people having watched the series to really understand what was happening. Half the cast were missing and it became a prequel to the series, showing us the last week of murder victim Laura Palmer's life. However, if you watched the TV series, you'll already know what happened to her, so watching what we already knew seemed a little pointless.The TV version of Twin Peaks had a certain charm. Yes, it covered (very) adult subject matter, but it also had a quirkiness which gave it a healthy dose of light-heartedness. The film however only has the darkness with none of the humour. A lot of fans found this jarring. In some ways Fire Walk With Me is more in keeping with (writer/director) David Lynch's later works: Lost Highway and Mullholland Drive, both of which are 'dark only' in tone.However, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a good film (believe it or not). But, I can totally see why it wasn't successful. For a start, if you haven't watched the TV series then you'll probably have no idea what's happening. But, if you watch the film before the series then you'll totally ruin the series (should you ever decide to watch it) as the film has MAJOR spoilers for the TV show. Despite lacking all the 'favourite' characters from the show you will find a damn fine horror movie which is both hauntingly atmospheric and visually stunning. Just don't expect to understand what's happening if you haven't watched the series.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

18,Bored_Dragon,The perfect final episode for TP series,8,11 February 2017,"This stands as an independent movie that can be watched even without any knowledge of TV show, but in that case, you probably won't like it. It is meant for fans of series and it rounds it perfectly. Chronologically, the movie is a prequel to the show, but in my opinion, it is the perfect final episode. It is significantly darker and heavier than series and it lacks that distinctive charm and atmosphere we got to love during original series, but it does not make it any less awesome. My only objection is the new actress in Dona role, cause she's not anywhere close to looks, charm and energy Lara Flynn Boyle had. Besides that, I'm sorry that movie does not show a bunch of characters from series that, I'm sure, we all wanted to see one last time. Many of them were included in the shooting of this movie but their scenes were cut in the final version. This is a very good movie, but I would not recommend watching it without a thorough knowledge of the previous TV show.8/10",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
19,Dr_Coulardeau,Absolutely fascinating,10,19 February 2008,"David Lynch is a genius. A mini series is a very difficult genre because each episode is rather long and must end with some unsolved suspense. Moreover altogether it is many hours on one single essential piece of suspense and it runs the risk of getting boring, of slowing down and of losing interest for the audience. What's more that genre is used quite a lot on American television with the soap operas. That miniseries also runs the risk of being compared today with the film, and of course it is. The film is short, dynamic and to the point all the time, perfectly concentrating on one single line of suspense. So what can David Lynch do to rejuvenate the genre, to regenerate the rules and inspiration of that genre? He does a lot and that's where he becomes a genius. First he embeds in his own miniseries short scene of a standard soap opera as the counterpoint of his own work. Then he multiplies allusions, visual or not, text or images or music, to many other series and authors. For one example the appearing of a black raven here and there is similar to the use of that animal in some of Stephen King's films or books. But these allusions are never comical, never derogatory. They are always there to provide the film with more depth, a cultural depth that I call a cultural ellipse. Those who see the ellipse get to that depth. Those who don't see it don't miss anything in the meaning of the film itself. But the best part of this series is the way the actors are directed. The scenes are systematically banal, standard, very trite even, especially the dialogue, and these scenes and these dialogues have been used many times in many TV series or films. But the actors are directed in such a way that the satire that could appear in these scenes is totally defused because the actors play them in an absolutely serious, truthful and even sincere way. Finally the various episodes are so inventive in surprises and even shocking revelations that we are really taken along in quite a dynamic way. So that watching the series after the film is quite interesting because of all the levels the film was obliged to push aside and that are developed here in full length, particularly all the elements showing the ugliness of life in this small community torn apart by rivalries and hatreds among the people, especially those who have some responsibility as for the future of the community itself. So get to it and enjoy it, especially if you like the succulent and over-ripe style that David Lynch uses so often.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
20,eddie_baggins,A dreary and depressing addition to the Twin Peaks cannon,4,29 September 2020,"A feature length film that divided critics upon release but has since gained a significant following and reevaluation as some type of obscure classic, David Lynch's Twin Peaks based Fire Walk with Me remains an enigma of a film from the erratic filmmaker, that is one for the fans of the show and those only.Finally allowing long-time viewers of the show that took over the TV space in the early 90's a chance to witness the final days and lead up to the fateful demise of high school student Laura Palmer, a mystery that will ever go down as one of the most talked about in television history, Fire plays an important part in the puzzle that is Twin Peaks but it also loses the shows oddball humor along the way and its array of detestable characters doesn't make for what you would call enjoyable viewing.Ramping up the more horrific nature of Twin Peaks dark underbelly and giving us only brief moments with the shows heavyweights like Agent Cooper and MVP The Log Lady, Fire is a depraved type of Lynch outing that would mean very little to those viewing the story with no context behind its basing and in highlighting Laura Palmer more than ever before we come to learn that the figure behind much of the goings on in the show is not in fact a very likable presence.Dealing with some highly odd and unnerving situations (as well as a healthy drug habit and more than a few romantic pathways) Palmer doesn't exactly have a great life but Lynch fails to make Sheryl Lee's high school sweet heart and town favorite someone we enjoy spending time with as the films initial interest in solving the murder of Teresa Banks instead turns to a final days account of Palmer's life that includes creepy run ins with her father, long-winded nightmarish nights out on the town and dates with her highly detestable on and off again boyfriend Bobby.The film works best when Lynch shy's away from Palmer and takes us to his fever dream like looks at situations that are clearly not of this world and much like the show before it, Fire can provide some gripping viewing straight out of the ""I can't believe what I'm seeing"" book of film-making that is undoubtedly a large reason behind why so many called the film out as a disappointment when it first premiered at its now infamous Cannes Film Festival screening.At the end of the day Fire is a dark and gloomy affair that is no where near as good as the best of its TV show counterpart but it still offers further insights into the strange world Lynch created that is sure to appease those seeking more time in this mysterious universe.Final Say -A film for die-hard Twin Peaks fans only, Fire Walk with Me ramps up the darkness to near unbearable levels as Lynch takes his audience and the characters he created to some odd, depressing and mostly forgettable directions.2 fingernails out of 5",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Even the opening credits is crafted: moving sad music in a world of blue, that appears to be a blank television screen, which is violently crashed by a hatchet: For a French critic, it is a message for the liberty and power of cinema directors against the television world. This constant dual voice is great: what's on screen works by itself and symbolizes something else.This deep texture is strengthened by the artistic writing: what is normal looks abnormal (the family relationships, the high-school,...) and what is extraordinary looks ordinary (the spirits: a old woman, a jazzy dwarf; their hide-outs: a store, a living-room,...).

It can be described as haunting, disturbing, scary, hard to understand. It's typical Lynch with a macabre atmosphere surrounding it.The plot is hard to understand at first but then it gets very interesting and you get to understand the metaphors and the principal character's mental condition.There are plenty of horror elements such as B.O.B. and his freaky appearances (love the ""fire walk with me"" sequence, brrrr). There are highly sensual moments, exceptional cop investigation, and the usual WTF moments like the nightmare (it has even been parodied by ""The Simpsons""): The ending is absolutely mind blowing and I rank it very high amongst those endings that leave you cold.The score by Angelo Baladametti is wonderful! The Direction is as always perfect. Lynch creates his own world and we are free to roam around it.Give the opportunity to this groundbreaking film. I wonder if the highly coveted ""Black Swan"" was inspired by this little gem.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
23,videorama-759-859391,"Walk into the flame, as Lynch does us solid again",8,19 November 2014,"I love David Lynch, but I've never been a fan of the Twin Peak Series. I hired the film because it was rated R, and the movie deserves it too, thanks to some sick violence, and a pulling back finger nail CU scene in an autopsy room. The film did have a limited release in Adelaide, where after a week of it's closing, it was brought back by popular demand, and this film demands attention, if suffering at the box office. The movie starts with the murder of a girl, found floating naked in a river, where at the time, this seems very unrelated to what ensues later. But this first 40 minute part of the film, with agent Des Cole and his young brilliant and little pathologist, Stanley, (a wonderful Kiefer Sutherland) going through the forensic, and investigative process, with a couple of obstructive and unwilling figures, is necessary. Again we don't forget, we're in weirdorama land, where these Lynch films get us thinking. He has a genius with all these weird drawn scenarios where underneath, is an all too real reality. That's his talent. He just telegraphs reality, in a more different, bizarre, and interesting style. We finally meet the infamous Laura Palmer, and we share her wild and no holds barred, 'living on the edge behavior', a week prefore her death, day by day, where we observe some very unsettling stiff. We have these really weird unforgettable scenes, like the ones with the midget, and agent Desmond on that stage, flanked bu a gaudy red curtain, and the whole film is an appreciated view, in it's after, although I must admit I really enjoyed the screen time with Kiefer. Yeah, you do find out who killed Laura, and it's worth waiting for, but my advice after watching this, let the brain, depress, and just know you enjoyed something special. Well acted performances, all round. Hell it even has the guy from Electric Dreams. Although it's Sheryl Lee who we really watch.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
24,Captain_Couth,The Prequel.,9,5 March 2005,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992) was a prequel to the short lived television series that was created by David Lynch and Mark Frost. This film chronicles the last seven days of the life of Laura Palmer. She was a tragic figure who wished her life could have been different. But family secrets and a wild lifestyle brought and end to all of that. The film begins with a similar case a year before the events of Twin Peaks. A murder in a small town that's the opposite number of the small quiet burg of Twin Peaks. It's a town that is as black as the soul of it's residence. There's an evil their that's as old as time itself. Two federal agents (Chris Issak and Kiefer Sutherland) come in and investigate. What they find their boggles the mind. A year later, the film goes back to Twin Peaks and that's where we catch the final days of Laura Palmer.An interesting premise that was not what people were expecting. Many people and fans were counting on a wrap up to the series. But in order to see the present we must look back at the past. I enjoyed this movie. We finally get to see the real Laura Palmer, not the sweet innocent girl that people reminisced about in the series. She was just another victim of B.O.B. We find out how B.O.B. came to become such the evil presence it was in the the series. Leland Palmer was a victim of B.O.B. as much as Laura. He was possessed by this terrible entity who has caused so much pain and anguish. Instead of becoming another tool of B.O.B., Laura sacrificed herself.Sherilyn Lee defined the character of Laura Palmer. Kyle Mac Lachlan returns as Agent Dale Cooper. Moira Kelly replaces Lara Flynn Boyle (due to some content issues) Ray Wise co-stars as Leland Palmer and David Lynch makes a cameo appearance as the lead Federal Agent. Miguel Ferrer, Madchen Amick and David Bowie make brief cameos as well.This is a must view for fans of the series. New fans will be initiated when watching this one as well.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
25,MaxBorg89,"Leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, but is nevertheless a worthy and fascinating prequel to the TV show",7,15 June 2007,"Few TV shows have caused such a stir for being prematurely canceled as Twin Peaks: when ABC decided to end the series in 1991 after only two seasons (30 episodes) fans went mad, particularly because the finale closed on a shockingly dark note (it was revealed that Special Agent Dale Cooper, played by Kyle MacLachlan, had actually been trapped inside the Black Lodge, while his evil doppelganger, controlled by the demonic Bob, had taken his place in our world). In an attempt to satisfy angry viewers, David Lynch continued the story in a feature film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, only to confuse or irritate even more people when it turned out the film was actually a prequel.On one level, Fire Walk with Me tries to answer certain questions; on the other, it raises more doubts on certain aspects of the series (especially the supernatural ones). This is evident in the prologue, where Regional FBI Chief Gordon Cole (Lynch himself) asks Special Agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks, a waitress with an obscure past. With the help of his partner (Kiefer Sutherland) Desmond starts seeking answers, before mysteriously disappearing and being replaced by Dale Cooper. What happened? We never find out. It seems like the first 32 minutes had the sole purpose of explaining how Cooper got involved in the case, as well as give him the opportunity to say: ""I have the feeling the killer will strike again"".And thus the film really begins: the familiar ""Welcome to Twin Peaks"" sign appears, Angelo Badalamenti's unforgettable theme music kicks in and the focus shifts on the movie's real protagonist, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). The picture chronicles her last seven days of life, and what a miserable seven days: not only is Laura on drugs and unfaithful to her boyfriend, she also does some weird business with the wrong people and is beginning to scare her best friend, Donna Hayward (Moira Kelly), and her parents (Ray Wise and Grace Zabriskie) with her increasingly odd behavior. All of that, however, is nothing compared to the horrors she experiences every night, as she is regularly raped by Bob (Frank Silva), a demon who has been abusing her since she was 12.Although much of what happens on screen had already been told on the show, Lynch chooses to show everything, leaving no room for doubt and delivering some of the most violent images of his career (the final twenty minutes are almost unbearably nightmarish). The film is very affecting, mostly thanks to Lee and Wise's performances, but the feeling that something is missing remains: the director's aim in the last episodes of the TV series (and the third season, had it been made) was to clarify Bob's origins, yet we are offered nothing substantial on that subject, and several other questions are left unanswered. What is the real role of The Man From Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) in all this? What exactly is the Black Lodge? How come Laura and Cooper had the same dream several days apart? Whatever explanation there was is probably buried in the hours of footage that was cut from the film, leaving only David Bowie's all too brief cameo to try and sort things out.Another flaw is, even though this is supposed to be a Twin Peaks movie, there isn't enough of what made the TV version unique: the movie is entirely Palmer-centric, leaving everyone else out of the picture. There's no sign of Sheriff Truman, Josie Packard, Catherine Martell or the Horne family. Crucially, there isn't enough of Cooper either, reducing MacLachlan to a mere guest star on what used to be his show. This affects the film's tone as well: whereas the series kept a balance between tragedy and humor (mostly related to Cooper's immortal ""Damn good coffee!"" or ""Cherry pie that'll kill ya"" lines), the movie is relentlessly bleak and scary throughout, with not a single moment of lightness to provide some relief.Overall, a bit of a frustrating experience: it is not what most people would expect, and some will probably be turned off by the dark tone and lack of answers, but in the end Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me is a compelling film, and proves to be a worthy closure for what seems to be the best mainstream television product of all time.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
26,NateWatchesCoolMovies,David Lynch's masterpiece,10,20 March 2015,"David Lynch's big screen prequel/sequel to his television phenomenon Twin Peaks departs from the shows light, kooky and benignly eccentric sensibilities. It starts at the more surreal, dark atmosphere which sometimes materialized in the show, especially in the last episode, and plunges headlong down a rabbit hole of sex, murder, mysteries, federal agents, parallel universes, psychological torment, otherworldly spirits, supernatural phenomena, incest, more cups of coffee (Im not even kidding, there's a scene where a stressed out looking Harry Dean Stanton makes a 'cup of good morning America'), and above all, Laura Palmer. The beautiful, mysterious homecoming queen we only saw as a corpse in the series comes to wild, screaming life in this film, and what a performance from the gifted Sheryl Lee. She perfectly captures the menace, hurt, confusion, hope, torment and wild desperation of Laura, in a towering, stunning performance. Ray Wise is equally magnificent as Leland Palmer. Angelo Badalamenti switches up the tone as well, letting the beautiful Laura theme and the classic Twin Peaks tones only play in limited, selective fashion. His theme for the film is a powerfully dark, otherworldly melody which lulls you right into the film's deep velvet grasp and haunts you in ways you can't describe. The angel of the Roadhouse, Julee Cruise, gets another tune to croon as well, and it might just be my favourite of the bunch. Laura tearfully looks on as Cruise intones 'Questions In A World Of Blue', a transfixing lament that seems to be meant for her alone. Lynch is a true master of the subtle touch, and you'd have to read many an online forum as well as watch the film and the show several times to pick up on all the hidden implications and shrouded ideas that aren't readily presented to you in a traditional narrative. That inaccessibility and refusal to play by the rules by serving things straight up is difficult for many people to get their heads around. To me though it's such a fascinating way to tell a story. He doesn't necessarily leave everything open to interpretation, he just hides the answers in a bewitching blanket of surreality, subtlety and dream logic, challenging the viewer to think using the unconscious mind and intuition to feel your way through the story, as opposed to tallying up facts and plot turns to analytically arrive at your cinematic destination. Perhaps this is why he meticulously oversees many of the DVD releases for his films, leaving out scene selections and unnecessary bells and whistles. The story matters most to him, in singular, unbroken form, a segment of his soul encapsulated on film in one cohesive effort, like a dream caught unawares by the lens. Fire Walk With Me was unfairly bashed, booed and downright critically clobbered for its stark and outright changes from the shows lighter tones, as well as its leaving out of some of the more popular characters that fans loved. Although this is jarring, I feel like Lynch has distilled all the elements in the show that mattered the most to him, and woven a gorgeous, seductive tapestry of pure Twin Peaks 'feel' and spectacle, as a loving gift to the fans who truly get it and are open to the wilder ideas explored briefly in the show. The film expands greatly on the ominous Black Lodge, and it's dwelling spirits, including the strange Tremonds, the one armed Mike, and the little red suited Man From Another Place. The killer demon Bob is very prevalent in this film, and if you thought he was scary in the show, well.. His scenes in this are downright soul shatteringly. Moira Kelly makes a softer, doe eyed version of Donna Hayward, which I quite liked. Miguel Ferrer returns as the cynical wise-ass Albert, Lynch as the hard of hearing FBI boss Gordon Cole, as well as Heather Graham, Grace Zabriskie, Eric DaRe, Madchen Amick, Peggy Lipton, etc. Newcomers to the Twin Peaks mythology are great as well, including Chris Isaak and Kiefer Sutherland as more FBI agents investigating the case of Teresa Banks in Deer Meadow, Jurgen Prochnow as a trapped soul in the spirit world, and a confused looking David Bowie as an agent who has been mired in the time bending fog of the spirit world long enough to render him brain fried. It's a love letter to the fans, really, but one that doesn't compromise an inch and is every ounce a Lynch picture, capturing the director at his most creative adventurous. He strives to plumb the depths of human behaviour and the forces beyond our perceptions which govern and influence from other planes. Seeing these tricky themes explored so rawly in a film based upon a TV show that had heavy roots soap opera and an often lighthearted tone only garnished with the disturbing elements in the film can be hard to swallow, which is no doubt the reason for the sour reception upon release. The film has stood the test of time and aged wonderfully though, seen by many grateful, loving fans as a dark dream straight from the heart, and a perfect film. If one is willing to accept the changes in tone and ambiguous, challenging nature of Lynch's storytelling (which I love!) then Fire Walk With Me is a sumptuous, gorgeous looking, vital piece of the Twin Peaks world, and in my mind Lynch's masterpiece.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
27,kluseba,Maybe my favourite movie of all times...,10,6 February 2011,"This movie is very difficult to find where I live but after I have fallen in love with the brilliant series and all the other works that David Lynch has done, I was really looking forward to watch this prequel that many professionals had heavily criticized. Many people said that the movie didn't have the same charming way of the life in a small and mysterious town, many people commented that the characters weren't as intense and believable as in the series and some people regretted that some of the series's characters like Audrey Horne or Harry Truman didn't appear in this movie and that some other main characters like Dale Cooper only had small roles.But I think that those people didn't understand the intention of this movie. It is sure that a movie of two hours and fifteen minutes can't develop the characters as much as a series with almost thirty episodes. It is also sure that this movie is about the last days of Laura Palmer and that's why characters like Audrey Horne have not much to do with this movie as they had no closer connection to the main character. This movie has a faster development than its series, it is straight forward and maybe less mysterious.But this movie is intense in every sense of the word. It is frightening, has a very dark and desperate atmosphere, it is horrifying and it is brilliantly played by Sheryl Lee and we get a true insight of the character of Laura Palmer and her everyday life along side her strange father, her weak mother, her many different friends and especially boyfriends. This movie shows in a very straight and hard way the wasted life of a beauty that has lost its youth and innocence. This movie is about sex, drugs, violence, crime, murder and fear and how to get drowned in a circle of desperation. The scene were Laura and Donna are in the discotheque is one if the most intense moments ever filmed in cinema's history with its strange music, weird light effects, ugly sex and violence scenes and the feelings that evolve from there. You feel hypnotized and desperate about the characters. The scene where Laura and her father are in their car and surprised by a strange one-armed man is strange, disturbing and extremely weird. The scene where Laura meets the strange Bob in her sleeping room is spooky, haunting and could create nightmares. The scene where Laura finally faces her destiny is brutal, uneasy and pervert. The conclusion and final scene of the movie is the only part where you feel a little bit of piece and hope in a very transcendent and spiritual way.David Lynch plays with your emotions and your wildest dreams and drowns you from one feeling to the other. While watching this movie I was frightened, I was almost crying, I was disturbed, I was delighted and I was absolutely impressed. I never thought that this movie would mess up with the best series in history but this flick is absolutely at the same level even if it is different because of its intensity.But even though this movie is straight and heavy, there are still many mysterious details and typical trademarks of the series from time to time like the weird introduction of the case by Gordon Cole and the dancing lady, things that only a genius could have invented. The weird scene with David Bowie is also one for the ages and extremely cool. There are also many little hints to discover that concern the fate of other characters of the series for example the scene where a bloody Annie sleeps next to Laura and transmits her a strange message.A sure thing is that this movie is no easy stuff and more scaring than any horror movie I have seen in my life. That's why this movie hasn't been a success for the masses and its very particular style is in fact very charismatic and different from anything you might expect. The point of desperation is that you know what will happen if you have seen the series and that you know that the characters are damned or even lost and the frightening about all of this is that you know that there is no escape and that you don't exactly know how or when it might happen. I really felt with the characters in this movie and this is something that has been developed in the series over several episodes but in this movie, I had the same feeling only after a couple of minutes. I have never seen or felt something as intense and strong concerning a movie in my whole life.I always thought that David Lynch's masterpiece concerning a movie is ""Lost highway"" but after watching this flick I am no longer sure about it. This is a masterpiece, a mysterious, weird, scaring horror movie with some dramatic elements. This movie doesn't need much blood or gore effects to frighten you, it's all about the atmosphere. This movie is so intense that you simply don't have the time to miss Audrey Horne and all the others that I have liked so much throughout the series. That is something brilliant and unexpected that only David Lynch could create and it's a shame but as well typical for the mainstream masses that they didn't accept this style at the time and that there haven't been any more movies about Twin Peaks. At least, the legacy found its end on an absolute climax.I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies and has a little sense of genius and is open-minded enough to accept the flick's very unique style. It is probably my favourite movie of all times or comes at least quite close to it.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

29,TOMNEL,Both intriguingly strange and mind numbingly confusing,6,16 December 2008,"""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" is one of the weirdest, most confusing movies ever made. Maybe if viewed after the television series this film is based off of, this movie would be easier to understand, but without any prior viewing of the show, this movie makes very little sense. Though it makes no sense, at the same time, it is so weird that it might make you want a second or third viewing to try and analyze it.Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) is a popular high school girl, and this movie is about her death. It's not a mystery to any fan of the show, or to anyone else, they state that she will die in the picture. Laura has an odd relationship with her father, Leland (Ray Wise). She has a man who comes in at night and rapes her. She goes to clubs to have sex with the patrons and walk around topless. She snorts coke. Her life and death are the main plot, and it is easy to understand. It's the side characters and sub-plots that make no sense.The most confusing scene features David Bowie in a strange cameo appearance. Kyle MacLachlan appears in this scene as Special Agent Dale Cooper. Cooper stands in front of a security camera and then walks into the security room to look at the camera monitor. He walks back out, and walks back in the room, only to find himself still in front of the TV, and Jeffries walks by. Jeffries claims that this is not Cooper, and then the screen goes into a dream, and then Jeffries disappears. This scene makes no sense at all, and probably requires the television show to make sense of it.The acting in this movie is very good. The musical score is nice. The direction is very stylish, with some interesting shots. The writing for the characters isn't bad, but this movie could make about 100 times more sense. This movie might not have been made for anyone who isn't a fan of the show, but nonetheless, as a stand alone picture, this is not an easy watch. It just doesn't have enough of an explanation behind it.Maybe to fans of Twin Peaks, this is everything you could want from a movie and more, but to someone who had never watched the show, this movie is both interesting and confusing. It's entertaining, but too out there for one to get.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 135 mins. R for language, sex, violence and nudity.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
30,truemythmedia,Decent Companion Piece to Twin Peaks,6,25 February 2020,"I'm a huge David Lynch fan (""Mulholland Drive"", ""Eraserhead""), and while unabashedly love the first season and a half of the groundbreaking TV show Twin Peaks, it took me a long time to get through the latter half of the second season of the aforementioned show because it sort of started to go off the rails when Lynch wasn't steering the ship. Just to give you a sense of timing: it took me about two weeks to get through the first season and a half (first eighteen episodes), and then after I found out who killed Laura Palmer and why, it took me almost a year to finish those final twelve episodes. I did finally finish those less-than-stellar episodes, and I was surprised to find that despite my relative disappointment with most of season two, the series finale was pretty great, and it left me eagerly awaiting this film, and then completing my Twin Peaks journey with Twin Peaks: The Return (I'm only a few episodes in so far, but it's fantastic). I was so excited after the season two finale that I jumped right from that episode to this movie (like I'm sure many of the hardcore fans of the series did when this film hit theaters).As a whole, I'm sort of conflicted about this movie. I think it's a very good companion piece to Twin Peaks, as it tells the story of Laura Palmer's final days leading up to her murder from Laura's perspective, revealing all of the information we learned about Laura and Twin Peaks in an easily digestible two-hour-and-fifteen minute chunk. In a lot of ways, I like this film: any time that I get to visit Twin Peaks with David Lynch as my guide, I'm happy. At the same time, I'm not really sure if this film needs to exist, as it doesn't reveal any new information, and it essentially spoils the whole story of the first two seasons. The only people who can really appreciate this movie for what it is are those who have seen the show, and those people already know everything that's going to happen in this movie, they just haven't seen it from Laura's perspective.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
31,davidmvining,Sort of prequel,8,3 February 2021,"This movie exists in a weird little spot. It's almost like a franchise film that can use shorthand to work with character relationships, but it's a prequel to the television series that preceded it in production. Could you watch this before the show? Not at all, you'd be completely lost about who is who and what is what on a very basic level, and that's before you even bring in David Lynch's surrealism into the mix. Who's James and why is he important before showing up for a single scene in the first ninety minutes of the movie? Who is Annie and why is she important before showing up in a dream sequence about halfway through? This functions as an extension of the show, but it also needs to work on its own, much like how Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country can mine the personal histories of the characters and the political background of the show and films that preceded it to inform smaller moments while telling a cohesive story within that framework at the same time.That story is the last week of Laura Palmer's life. Going into the movie, we know that she dies and we know who kills her, how he does it, and where. There's little mystery to the film, and the film doesn't really treat the final reveals in Laura's final few days as huge twists to anyone but Laura. However, since so much of the movie is from her perspective, we do spend a lot of time with her as she reacts to these realizations. Her father being BOB is something we've known about since the middle of season 2, but Laura finds out about halfway through the film. Sheryl Lee plays Laura at the absolute end of her rope throughout the film, so when she finds these things out she's nearly completely at her wits end, screaming at the new information.And this points to another factor in the film: Lee's performance. Normally this type of movie would start with her in an earlier stage of decline, not just days away from the end of years of abuse. That would entail a slower descent, but that's not the story David Lynch is telling. He's telling the story of a long abused girl acting out in her final days towards her inevitable death. What really saves Lee's performance is the fact that Laura's decline is multi-faceted depending on who she's facing. When facing her father, she's manic and terrified because he is the source of her abuse. Facing her best friend Donna she can be alternatively deeply wounded and callus, depending on the situation. To Jacques she's a loose woman out for sensation in an attempt to numb herself from her own life. To James she can be both open and closed, seeing some comfort in him but also knowing that he's too innocent to understand what she's going through. To her boyfriend Bobby she's completely manipulative, getting her drug fix through him. Laura doesn't have an arc in this film, just a series of interconnected emotional stakes that culminate in the inevitable, and Lee plays them all to the hilt and very well.That ending is horrifying, by the way. Using the freedom of storytelling outside of network television, Lynch was able to explicitly provide a more dangerous view of the world of Twin Peaks including direct depictions of drug use and nudity. However, the final confrontation in that train car outside of town is surprisingly discrete. Lynch must have felt that watching Laura descend was worth watching directly, but not her death. Her death is filmed primarily in shadow and with heavy use of montage to imply the violence invited upon her, and it's extremely effective. There with Ronette Pulaski and set to the Requiem in C Minor by Luigi Cherubini, Laura's vicious death at the hands of her own father is done through the kind of implied action that Hitchcock used in Psycho. That Laura's ending has been built up to through the whole film strengthens the ending, making it feel like the fulfillment of a tragedy.This being a David Lynch film there's also a lot of surrealism. I haven't even mentioned the first half hour of the film about two FBI agents who go to investigate the death of Teresa Banks, the girl that Agent Dale Cooper talked about who had died a year before the show's first episode in the same way as Laura. There's a heavy emphasis on Lynch's brand of comedy here with odd encounters of unique characters as the two agents try to decode the earliest cryptic signs of the overall mystery, one of them eventually swallowed up whole by it. There's also David Bowie briefly showing up in the Philadelphia FBI office as a long lost agent with a series of nonsensical things to say (which, from what I understand, all come to fruition in the show's revival) and my favorite performance in all of Twin Peaks of David Lynch himself as Gordon Cole, the hard of hearing Deputy Chief.I think all of the movie's faults lie in the fact that it is one piece in a larger whole to a much greater degree than any normal franchise picture. As the prequel to the series, it relies heavily on previous audience knowledge for its characters. Much of its first half hour is designed around laying out elements that were intended to play out in greater detail in a planned pair of follow up films that never got made and assumedly morphed into the revival show. That makes the show's mythos a greater emphasis than Laura's story really needs, providing distraction rather than fulfillment. It's all a relatively small part of the film, though, but it's something that can feel overwhelming even to one immersed in the overall story.I've seen an interview with Lynch where he describes his surrealistic elements in his films. He says that structure to the underlying is very important to him, but he doesn't feel like having a story spoon-fed to the audience is terribly interesting to him, so he layers in abstract elements to make it more interesting and provide different sources of meaning and interpretation. I find it easy to watch a Lynch film and figure out the literal movement of characters with motivations within a plot, but it's the abstract images that jump around the characters that are often the greater source of meaning. At the same time, I feel no real interesting in grabbing onto each image to discern what they could mean within the overall mythos of the story. I know there are communities out there that obsess over this stuff, but it's not my bag, baby. However, I do actually really like his use of images. I don't feel like I need to break down each one of them in order to understand the overall thematic point that Lynch is attempting. The images on their own, and their placement in the story, is enough to imbue interesting meaning to the story on its own. It also helps that the characters themselves are interesting on their own.So, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is not going to go down as Lynch's masterpiece. Its uncomfortable spot in the middle of the larger Twin Peaks story kind of prevents that. However, that doesn't mean that it's not very good. And it is very good. The heart of this story is very much in the right place, looking steely-eyed at Laura Palmer's final days and showing us a broken girl with no where to go but down.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
32,framptonhollis,Lynch posses the power to make ceiling fans and talking monkeys terrifying,10,29 September 2017,"I have seen this film a number of times, and it still affects me brutally. The film just gets such an emotional response out of me every time I see it that when I'm done watching it, the power of certain visuals and performances (Sheryl Lee and her horrified expressions are hard hitting and it's so sad to see that she practically got no recognition for her performance in this when it was first released to much unreasonable and confusing hatred) still linger. Lynch...Lynch...Lynch...how brilliant can one man be? I have spent many a review gushing over his projects and their artistic, absurdist, and avant garde brilliance. It feels as if my constant, passionate praise has sucked the man dry of any further discussion, and yet there's always MORE things I can compliment Lynch for. Lynch makes the mundane seem horrific and surreal, he turns the tables on the viewer and subverts any and all expectations on a nearly scene by scene basis. The entire first half hour of this movie is one prolonged, darkly humorous examination of an anti-Twin Peaks, a terribly bizarre, disconnected, and mean spirited little town named Deer Meadow. With this first section of the film, Lynch takes one of his most popular, well established products and basically just parodies it with a multitude of characters viewers of the original series had never seen or heard of before...and he pulls it off as more than just some kind of ""troll""; instead, he uses it as a vessel to explore the everpresent doppelganger theme that appears in much of his work, Peaks in particular, while also helping bring some comedy in the mix of this otherwise painfully tragic and disturbing work of surrealist horror.Then, things get even weirder when we are faced with familiar faces, particularly the face of the iconically quirky and chipper Agent Dale Cooper who's looking much more worrisome and disturbed than usual. And then Lynch goes all out insane with the surrealism, every shot is experimental, audio overlaps and lights flash and images of wild absurdity are constant. This scene must be experienced to be believed, there is no describing such a momentous David Lynch sequence. There is no describing of it.Scenes like this consistently pop out of the blue throughout the movie...except they aren't ""out of the blue"" at all. A first time viewer may be baffled by some of these visuals and scenes, but a devoted enough explorer of the Twin Peaks universe(s?!) will soon be able to realize that all of these moments have some sort of purpose. Lynch is telling a story, but, as Lynch always does, he tells this story in an unconventional way, breaking as many boundaries as he can get away with.And yet the film is still relatable and emotionally affecting. It's simultaneously a creepily atmospheric surrealist nightmare and a deeply troubling dark tragedy about a young woman coming to terms with the pains of abuse and her own twisted world that steadily shreds its fabric day by day...Even after this barrage of disturbing and borderline traumatizing imagery and sounds (the score for this film is just phenomenal...but it's also the most demented and distressing movie soundtrack I've ever heard), there is still a brief flash of light at the end of the title.And then the legend of Twin Peaks is ready to truly begin...(Cue Twin Peaks theme)",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
33,nycritic,The Other Side of Dad,7,16 June 2006,"David Lynch is the kind of director who will present a blissful, near-perfect setting, and slowly turn it over its head and let the little monsters that have been hiding within scamper out until in a fit of rage he'll shake the now upside-down setting vigorously until all that is left is nothingness, black dread, and a monster looking right back at you with hungry eyes.Revisiting the placidity that was the veneer for dark perversions in BLUE VELVET, Lynch here goes back to the little town of Twin Peaks and instead of beginning the story from the death of Laura Palmer like the series did, he decides to go back in time one week and describe how this beautiful tease of a girl spiralled into the black and became the myth that spawned the series.Lynch is one of the most efficient workers of Surrealism in contemporary cinema, taking off in his own way where Bunuel left due to his death in 1983. Presenting a doomed scenario, his eye has a habit of describing events a little slower than they usually would happen in reality. There is a dream-like quality of everything within the Twin Peaks universe, where people who have never met communicate with each other, and weird apparitions filter themselves into our world fueled by Laura's own terror. As a matter of fact, it's Laura's dysfunctional relationship with her father that is at the core of these strange events that seem at times so convoluted to cause a migraine headache (unless you've seen the entire series, then you're fine). The problem is that the final product looks and feels like one huge, incomplete mess, but an interesting one to look at. TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME is like watching a cross between a Magritte and a Dali, implausible, but seductive, and with no apparent solution.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
34,PredragReviews,Excellent conclusion to the TV series!!,9,28 September 2016,"This is one of David Lynch's finest films. Considering the popularity of the This is one of David Lynch's finest films. Considering the popularity of the ""Twin Peaks"" TV series, this would seem a hard act to follow. As usual, Lynch doesn't fail to intrigue and push the envelope even further. The film does pander to those who wanted to see the last seven days of Laura Palmer's life, but it also sets many subplots in motion which were hinted at during the series. ""Fire Walk With Me"" is much, much darker than the series in terms of style, direction, plot, acting, humour and cinematography, and in many ways stands independently of the series. The beauty is that one does not need the other. They are both memorable in their own ways, similar in some but extremely different in others.This film works most efficiently if you have seen both seasons of the ""Twin Peaks"" series, as it's power resides in the inevitability of Laura's demise (this is not to say it is by the numbers and there are no surprises in store) and images from the later episodes of the series (which, yes, occur a long time later chronologically). It is considerably darker, however, than the series with the humor more or less restricted to the opening half hour, which sets up the entire ""Twin Peaks"" story, but once Laura Palmer is introduced, the story is (appropriately, to say the least) extremely dark and void of the light tone which characterized the television series. It is, like much of David Lynch's canon, a film that will surprise you and find beauty and truth in the strangest images and places. As long as you are aware of Lynch's earlier work (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Dune or The Elephant Man), the darker scenes/moments should not come as too much of a surprise. If you expect more of the TV series, you will, I'm afraid, be disappointed. But with an open mind, you will enjoy this film on it's own, strong merits.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
35,Christmas-Reviewer,I have always loved this movie,8,6 September 2006,"I was a fan of the show from the moment it went on the air! I got a little bored of it once they solved the mystery of ""Laura Palmer"". To my dismay the television show ended with a cliff hanger. One year later ""Fire Walk With Me"" was released and I was hoping this film would solve the television shows cliffhanger but it didn't.However the cliffhanger may be solved if the deleted footage of ""Fire walk with me"" ever gets released! However on with the review.Now if you ever want to watch this without seeing the TV show your making a big mistake! You should watch the first 7 episodes of the TV show and then watch Season 2 until the murder of Laura Palmer is solved. Its downhill after that. Now I always loved this movie. My only complaint is that Lara Flynn Boyle is not in the movie! She played Laura's best friend in the TV Show but is replaced here by Moira Kelly.The first part of the movie is fine! Lots of fans hate it. I do not understand that! I thought it was great! However all of these people were never not from THE TV SHOW! So I think this p-o'd fans of the TV Show! The movie is creepy and has a great sound-mix. You should watch this with a great sound system It rocks! The film also adds a new character named Phillip Jeffries. THis adds a newer mystery to the overall Twin Peaks fabric. David Bowie plays Phillip Jeffries. He pops in & out very fast. He says ""I don't want to talk about Judy"" and points to Dale Cooper and says ""Who do you think that is?"". This is by far one of the best scenes in the film. This film is very violent. Where The TV show was about what hiding under the surface the films shows you and it is not pleasant.Again the TV-Show was about the town ""Twin Peaks"" and the death of Laura Palmer and how nobody really knew the nightmare that Laura was living in. In ""Fire Walk With Me"" we are side by side with Laura in her wide awake nightmare. A nightmare the viewer is also experiencing. It is chilling and disturbing! This is a great movie. Underrated & misunderstood.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
36,punishmentpark,It just gets better and better...,10,10 January 2014,"Twin Peaks has beautiful woods, the streets and houses are so pretty, some people may be quirky, but all of them mean well, and Twin Peaks High seems like a nice place for a young girl to be educated... but from the onset we know that there is something, probably a lot of things, not just as they seem in this little American Garden of Eden...This was probably my third or maybe fourth viewing of 'Twin peaks: fire walk with me' and even though the scariest parts (those with Bob) can't possibly be as scary as they were the first time, the film becomes more and more fascinating to watch, and remains scary enough, too. In the beginning there is some comic relief when David Lynch as FBI man Gordon Cole shouts into the phone and such, but pretty soon mysteries are abound and an increasingly nightmarish tone sets in that is no less than haunting. David Lynch himself must be otherworldly, and he brings that world into the world of Twin Peaks with so much power, confidence and precision that this film, to me, becomes a world unto itself. The acting parts by (primarily) Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise and David Silva and 'the agents' are by the way essential 'components'. It is rare for me to appreciate a film so much more when I've already seen it at least two times, but there it is.I have never seen the TV-series, so that will probably be the next step, so that I can watch this one again after that. It used to be 8 out of 10, but that is no way nearly enough; 10 out of 10.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
37,BrandtSponseller,"Good, but seems like you shouldn't watch before seeing the series",7,6 March 2005,"A prequel to the Twin Peaks television series, Fire Walk with Me begins after Teresa Banks has been murdered. Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland), two FBI agents, have been called in to investigate. After forty minutes or so, this story line is dropped and we meet Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), an oddly adult high school student who was homecoming queen and who looks like a stereotypically cute, perky, ""middle"" American living behind a proverbial white picket fence. But Palmer has a dark side, which Fire Walk with Me takes a great deal of time exploring.I probably shouldn't be writing this review yet. I'm just now getting around to the Twin Peaks universe, and I haven't yet watched the television series except for ""Chapter 1"" from the first season. I'll likely completely change this review at some point in the future, but I'm posting it now in the hope that it might help someone decide whether the film is worth viewing for them, or at least it might provide some interesting comments.If one wants to avoid spoilers and have a better chance of understanding this film, it seems like maybe Fire Walk with Me should not be viewed until one has seen the television series. Here's why I watched it first: I've long been a fan of Lynch's films. When Twin Peaks appeared on television in the early 1990s, I was working as a musician on a cruise ship and did not have the opportunity to watch it. I knew there was a film made, but I didn't realize it was made after the series, and I did not want to watch it without being able to also experience the television show. Cut to 2002. The first season is finally released on DVD, so I figure here's my chance to watch it. The beginning of the first episode says, ""Previously on Twin Peaks"". Previously? I'm pretty obsessive about watching series in order, so ""previously"" bothered me a lot. I ran to the Internet to look for Twin Peaks chronologies, and I find out that there is a two-hour pilot episode--often those are simply thought of as feature-length films, so I figured that Fire Walk with Me is it.I finally picked up Fire Walk with Me yesterday. Before watching I double-checked just enough of the DVD box synopsis to be sure that I should watch it first. It said ""prequel"", so I went ahead, figuring that ""prequel"" just meant it was the ""initial film"". I know prequels are usually made later in film series, but even when that's the case, I more often than not watch prequels ""in order"" before the other films on subsequent viewings. Besides, I thought that ""prequel"" was likely just being used in a different way here. When you're a fan of someone like David Lynch, you often expect almost everything they do to be deeply enigmatic.So is the film worth watching under circumstances similar to mine? Well, I did enjoy it, but primarily for the reason that attracts me to Lynch--I'm a big fan of surrealism, absurdism, etc. Fire Walk with Me is nothing if not bizarre. However, unlike other Lynch films there seems to be an absence of clues within the film to figure out Fire Walk with Me. I'm only assuming that the series will provide more clues. I may be wrong. But at this point, I'm not about to read others' interpretations of the film, as I'm worried they might give further spoilers for the show. As I've mentioned, I've only watched the first episode of the television series so far. I finally figured out that the two-hour pilot episode is something different, and not included on the Season 1 disc, but it's too late now. I assumed that the ""Previously on Twin Peaks"" intro was just Lynch being bizarre again, but unfortunately that's not the case. While we're at it, I have to note that based on the first episode, the series isn't doing much for me. It's far too normal and non-Lynchian (of course not helped by the fact that Lynch doesn't direct most of the episodes). I'm not a fan of soap opera-like, realist drama, and so far that's what the series primarily seems to be.As always, Fire Walk with Me has Lynch's extreme attention to and manipulation of cinematic details. For example, there is a sequence of long, odd silence (in the police station), there is a production design-related instance of weird, minute ""clues"" in the appearance of a woman in a pink dress, characters are directed to use strange speech mannerisms, there is an unsettling combination of eras in the setting (cars of different eras, characters acting liking combinations of 50s and 80s youths per popular depictions, etc.), there are peculiar layers of information, such as the cowboy/redneck bar band playing uncharacteristic music, and of course there are cutaways to bizarre people, saying and doing bizarre things--such as the midget talking about Formica tables and saying ""Garmonbozia"". I love all of that stuff.I was a bit disappointed that the early part of the film was abandoned, as the investigative story was good, but the material about Laura Palmer was intriguing in its own way. Her behavior, and the behavior of those around her, became increasingly more abnormal and fascinating as the film went on, so that worked for me well. But I still don't know how to interpret the film, and I hope the series doesn't put me off. I also hope the series is eventually released in its entirety (including the two-hour episodes at the beginnings of seasons--it was a crime to leave that off of Season 1). Fire Walk with Me is worth watching for fans of Lynch weirdness, but I can't really recommend watching the film before watching the series.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
38,mstomaso,Severely under-rated prequel to one of the best TV series ever,10,16 October 2004,"By the time this film was released, critics and TV audiences had already decided its decidedly mediocre box-office fate. The usual network attitude toward anything which demands thought and interpretation assured the cancellation of the series in its second season, and Lynch's departure from the show's director's chair to begin this film project all but sealed the fate of the show. Unfortunately, this same fate determined both the critical and public approach to the film project. TP:FWWM is a prequel to the two-season Twin Peaks saga, and (sort of) answers the question 'how and why did Laura Palmer die?'. Fans of the show mostly knew the answers before they saw this film, but to see Laura's life so vividly realized, and to see the TV characters cast into such a different, more harsh, surreal and disturbing light, really invigorates the entire TP phenomenon. FWWM actually inspired me to watch the entire series again (and as of 2004, I am in the process of watching it again). Fans of the series who found themselves disappointed by the final few episodes of the series because they felt it became too bizarre, are likely to find this film more gripping, though they will probably end up as unsatisfied as they were at the onset. Those who found the second season thrillingly experimental are likely to be surprised by the subtlety of and dramatic quality of this film. Those, like me, who approach the film with few tangible expectations might just find themselves, compelled, disturbed, and very entertained. The performances are generally very good, but not entirely even. Some TV cast-members, given the vastly expanded possibilities of cinema, really showed their range and depth. Sheryl Lee, MacLachlan, Dana Ashbrook, and Ray Wise were especially impressive. The cinematography is less powerful than the usual Lynchian vision (see Eraserhead, Lost Highway for extreme examples), and is more in keeping with the TV show's straightforward, but moody, photographic approach. The overall production values are, in fact, comparable to those of Mulholland Drive - also originally planned by Lynch as a TV show. Though more subtle than many of Lynch's more extravagant works, TP:FWWM is very successfully manipulative and powerful. I ardently appreciate Lynch, considering him one of cinema and performance's greatest contemporary artists. And I am unashamed to state that I believe this to be among his finest works. Many of Lynch's fans love to write interpretations of Lynch himself, as if all of his films are in some way connected beyond the obvious fact that he directed (and more often than not scripted) them. I do not disagree with this approach, but, in my opinion, any such universalizing comments more or less miss the point. Lynch is one of many director's who view film as an art form, not as a craft, nor as a vehicle for specific messages and stories. As Lynch has stated, repeatedly, his films involve a dream-like reality and often attempt to invoke a dream or nightmare state in viewers. Unlike most, however, Lynch succeeds in the purity of his art. His films demand interpretation, engagement and, what's more, demand a different and unique interpretation by most who view them. If you are looking for something which can be universally interpreted from TP:FWWM as part of this imagined set of Lynchian themes, I am not the reviewer to give it, look elsewhere. I have too much respect for Lynch's artistry to subject him to my own interpretive explanations. If you are looking for a simple story which will clear up the insanity of Twin Peaks, don't bother with FWWM. If you are looking, open-mindedly, for an intense, disturbing, and well constructed cinematic experience which creates more questions than it answers, and retains elements of mystery in a fatalistically driven plot environment, you've come to the right place.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
39,hall895,For Twin Peaks die-hards only,6,18 May 2007,"If you were not a fan of the Twin Peaks television series you would not want to bother watching this film. Fire Walk with Me pretty much requires the viewer to have already seen every episode of the television show. If you haven't you will be well and truly lost as you watch this film unfold in the bizarre Twin Peaks universe. Assuming you have the requisite working knowledge of all things Twin Peaks heading in you'll at least be able to understand the film. Whether you'll like the film is an iffy proposition at best.Fire Walk with Me is a prequel to the television series which means Laura Palmer is alive. But before we can get to Laura there's a thirty-minute or so prologue (a prequel within a prequel?) about the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks, whom all the Twin Peaks die-hards know was the first victim of the killer who would eventually murder Laura. After what any fan of the television show will see as some typical weirdness, and not much in the way of resolution, the prologue ends and we move forward in time, jumping into the final week of Laura Palmer's life. It's nice to see Laura alive for the first time. The television show had already established Laura was not the sweet, innocent homecoming queen she seemed but her demons were, for the most part, only hinted at on TV. In Fire Walk with Me those demons are on full display. Where the television show was subtle, the movie is in your face. A little too much in your face some might say as David Lynch takes full advantage of all the opportunities provided by producing an R-rated movie. Certainly nothing is held back here as we watch Laura Palmer spiral downward towards her sad end.In the rather brutal telling of the story of Laura Palmer's final days all the charm of the television series has been lost. For all the terrible things that occurred in the series the show always had that small-town, quirky charm. Not here. For the Twin Peaks fan it's nice to see those familiar characters again. And the film does add a lot to the Laura Palmer story and allows you to get to know her much better. But you may come away wishing you hadn't gotten to know her quite so well. Perhaps some things are better left unspoken and unseen. There were two sides of Laura Palmer and this film shows you much too much of the dark side. There was a lot of good in her, watching this film makes it hard to remember that even as you can't help but sympathize with the way she is being taken advantage of and the way she will meet her ultimate fate.If you're a real Twin Peaks fan you really do have to see the movie. There is a lot to like about it. The story is captivating as ever, if decidedly less charming in this go-around. And the performances from the cast are mostly very good, most notably from Sheryl Lee who finally gets to play a living, breathing Laura Palmer after having been introduced to the world dead and wrapped in plastic. And Ray Wise as Laura's father Leland also does fine work in portraying a disturbing and complicated character. We never got to see Leland and Laura interact in the series and their relationship is fascinating to watch. Fascinating and also more than a little creepy as the movie's Leland is a constantly ominous, threatening presence. You'll miss Lara Flynn Boyle who for the film has been replaced in the role of Donna by Moira Kelly. Kelly fails to bring the same spark to the character that Boyle did. And while many of the characters from the show return you'll miss those who notably don't. Audrey and Benjamin Horne, Sheriff Truman, Deputies Andy and Hawk, Doc Hayward and Pete Martell and Big Ed...would have been nice to see them and some others one last time if even just briefly. It is nice to have the opportunity to go back to the Twin Peaks universe. Unfortunately it's not quite the universe you remember. This is a much darker, sinister and decidedly less enjoyable Twin Peaks. Sometimes you can't go home again.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
40,rockman182,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992),9,10 June 2017,"Twin Peaks is probably my favorite show of all time. I've been a David Lynch fan for years, ever since I got blown away watching Mulholland Drive. With the exception of Dune, I pretty much will go to bat for all of his films, they are excellent. An acquired taste yes, but Lynch is truly a visionary. Twin Peaks was a near perfect show that was cancelled too early (at least it came back). I watched Fire Walk With Me once after my first watch of the TV show and liked it but just knew a revisit of the film would make me appreciate the art behind it even more. This was exactly the case.Fire Walk With Me is basically a prequel to Twin Peaks. We first see the events directly after the death of Teresa Banks, and then fast forward to the events leading up to the death of Laura Palmer. We get to see a dead girl basically spring to life and see the beauty of Laura Palmer and the inner turbulence and turmoil she experienced. She had so much going on, a wide range of emotions. She was nowhere near as innocent or faithful as people expected her to be. She was sex crazed, drug fueled, and self destructive. And at the same time she was viciously haunted by the malevolent spirit BOB, and his human embodiment.That plot would probably sound confusing to anyone not familiar with the show. That's basically a clue to go watch the show. We get a few new characters and portrayals with this film. We are introduced to Agent Chet Desmond, because Kyle MacLachlan sort of wanted to distance himself from the film (so he has a much smaller role). Sherilyn Fenn had other arrangements. Lara Flynn Boyle did not return to portray Donna Hayward so she was played by Moira Kelly. None of this really effects the film. It would have been nice to see most of the cast on this cut (most of the cast can be seen on the missing pieces/extended scenes which is a feature length film on its own).Fire Walk With Me is straight up horror. It's pure Lynch madness at his finest. Rapid slowed down images, quick cuts with jarring sounds, and sheer terrifying imagery; hallmark David Lynch. Sheryl Lee as Laura Palmer is so great. I love that this film was mad to really get to see her in this role and she knocked it out of the park. There is so much mystique and mythos in the world of Twin Peaks, its so easy to get engulfed in its world. I loved every minute of this film.Cinema lovers will find a way to connect this film with other Lynch films. There is a prominent stage act performing under blue spotlight (Blue Velvet), a mysterious item is almost like a portal that plays the utmost importance in the film (much like the key in Mulholland Drive). This film wont be for everybody, especially if you aren't too familiar with the craziness that Lynch brings. Fire Walk With Me signified the first time Lynch was basically able to bring his vision without network regulations. its a crazy, horrifying, sex and violence heavy film and a beautiful entry into the Twin Peaks saga.9/10",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
41,cultfilmfan,Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me,9,17 February 2006,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a feature film prequel to the television series Twin Peaks. The film shows the last week of a high school teenager named Laura Palmer. Laura does drugs and balances life with her male friends and her best friend Donna. Laura is also really cautious around her overbearing and creepy father. She also seems to get weird visions and nightmares on top of things, so her life is pretty complicated and she is a pretty disturbed teenager. At the end of the film it ends where the Twin Peaks television show starts with the investigation of her murder. Winner of The Saturn Award for Best Music at The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films; The Brit Award for Best soundtrack at The Brit Awards and The Independent Spirit Award for Best Original Score. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and film editing. I have never seen the Twin Peaks television series before, but I really wanted to see this film because I figured I wouldn't have had to have seen the TV show seeing as this is a prequel and I also wanted to see the film because I love the films by the film's writer/director David Lynch. The film is hard to describe in many ways because like so many of David Lynch's films it is very unusual and is sometimes hard to figure out. But I was intrigued by this movie and I liked the character's dialog and the eeriness of the town and the different people who live there. The film is very well crafted and put together and I like how David Lynch was able to put together such an atmospheric and stylish film. Also to write a movie this interesting and off the wall takes the genius of a great writer and director such as David Lynch. I was thoroughly captivated by the film and entertained. I was also fascinated by this wonderfully unique journey into this odd little town with odd little characters and settings. A truly unique film experience and another hit for David Lynch.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

But this prequel does more than just solve unanswered questions from the series; in fact it creates more questions than it solves, and therein lies its greatness, and Lynch's. The atmosphere is much darker than the series - much closer to Lynch films like Blue Velvet and Lost Highway - with none of the small-town quirkiness and charm, and with absolutely no comic relief, which makes it an even more difficult watch. For fans of the series, it's essential, but make sure you watch the whole series first.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
43,mario_c,"""Bob I want all my garmonbozia""",10,10 April 2007,"When I saw this movie for the first time, back in 1996, I was completely astonished! I had never heard about this guy named David Lynch, in spite of knowing a series called TWIN PEAKS that six years sooner had passed on Portuguese TV. From the series I remembered almost nothing, except the name of Laura Palmer, an agent of the FBI and the introducing song, which I used to appreciate But when I watched this movie everything changed! ""David Lynch! Who is this guy? This man is a genius!"" I thought Well, I started seeking more movies from him and in the following year LOST HIGHWAY was released...I became a fan! David Lynch was making movies as I had never seen before: surreal, allegoric, complex To my mind they were simply fantastic! Since then Lynch became, for sure, my favorite director! Besides, I think that nowadays he's one of the few directors which really ""sees"" cinema as an Art!So, TWIN PEAKS  FIRE WALK WITH ME was the first Lynch's movie I've ever saw, and from all the movies I've seen from him since then, especially the later ones, have been ""influenced"", in my mind, by this movie I mean, if it's true that David Lynch uses the same kind of ""icons/allegories"" in many different movies  no matter if they are more recent or older (we can watch the ""red curtains"" in a great part of his movies, for example, but there are much more of these Lynchian ""symbols/icons"")  I think that David Lynch doesn't ""explain"" so well in any other film what some of these symbols might signify, what is their meaning Probably I think that way because it was the very first movie I've seen from Lynch, but even so, I think this movie explains many things (especially concerning to these ""icons"") about the ones he did latterly as LOST HIGHWAY, or MULHOLLAND DRIVE. I also think that one who has seen this movie first will easier understand, for example, what possibly mean the ""Red Curtains"", ""The white face's guy"" or the ""Cabin on Fire"" in LOST HIGHWAY Of Course it's all just my personal interpretation, but I still think that TWIN PEAKS holds the key to solve many ""mysteries"" of his most recent films  But that's just what I thinkAbout the movie itself, I think it's great! TWIN PEAKS is a classic, whether we refer the series or the movie. Laura Palmer's murder is revealed just in the movie, as it was done to report what happened before the point where the series begins. The film is really fantastic, because it shows us a story full of allegoric dreams, mysterious characters and sick relationships; but essentially it demonstrates how twisted and wicked the Human soul can be A few words that illustrate all of this sickness, and which I will never forget, are the ones said by the little man, almost in the end of the movie: ""Bob I want all mygarmonbozia!"" But are really Human all those characters which appear in this movie? Are they ""real"" or just part of strange dream?... I don't know for sure, but I think there's something else behind the red curtains and the black and white pavement! And for me, it's the key to ""penetrate"" in the twisted mind of David Lynch On the other hand the movie creates incredible ambiances and scenarios: these ""places"", which we don't know if they are ""real"" or not the sounds, the lights, the music it's all combined in an excellent kind of cinematography. The dancing scene, with the red light, in the bar, was very nice, and the soundtracks which are behind this one and many others are also great! But we can't forget the acting! Sheryl Lee is amazing! If Laura Dern is a great part of INLAND EMPIRE we can almost say the same about Sheryl in this movie She has a fantastic role because her character is too complex, with impulsive and dramatic changes of behavior and personality, and she did it really well. Her character had moments of pure drama, in which we can see fear, weakness and despair on her face, but also of craziness, absurd hilarity (when she's stoned in the woods with Bobby), and Sheryl made it perfectly, with excellent acting changes.It's definitely a classic to me, not only in Lynch's cinematography, but also in all movies' history!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
44,roedyg,A must for Twin Peaks Fans,8,9 October 2014,"The movie starts with two FBI detectives investigating the murder of hooker Teresa Banks. Chris Isaak as tough guy Special Agent Chester Desmond is heart-thumping handsome. Kiefer Sutherland plays his meek sidekick Sam Stanley. Then, before they even get started, they both suddenly disappear and nobody seems to care.The rest of the movie is exclusively about Laura Palmer, the girl whose murder forms the core of the Twin Peaks series. Sheryl Lee was cast in the TV series for her ability to impersonate a good-looking corpse. She has a body like a Playboy Vargas drawing come to life. To my astonishment, she was a totally convincing actor in very complicated and demanding role. I simultaneously hated her, wanted to throttle her, pitied her, and wanted to help her shape up.This is very R-rated movie, packed with female nudity, drug taking and violence. There are many grotesque scenes of teenage girls having sex with hideous older men.Laura is addicted to cocaine. She gets her drugs by charming Bobby, now a drug dealer, hooking, and trading sex for drugs. She takes any drug without even asking what it is. She abuses her body so badly, but oddly it remains in perfect condition.Bob, the evil homicidal spirit that possesses people and makes them kill, take on an alternative explanation. Leland sexually abuses his daughter Laura. Laura is in denial about her willing participation and hallucinates that her father is some grizzled intruder Bob.Many of the characters from the TV series get to make a short appearance. If you had not seen the TV series, these appearances would make no sense. The actors are still young and beautiful, just as they were just after the TV series was filmed.The story unfolds with the inevitability of the biblical crucifixion story, leading inexorably to Laura's murder, tying the movie in neatly to the first episode of the TV series.They replaced Laura Flynn Boyle with the much leaner Moira Kelly to play Donna Hayward.There is the usual Lynch strangeness, a backwards-talking dwarf, a boy with a pointed nose mask, a old lady beckoning, a one-armed man... but it does not overpower and spoil the movie continuity.One continuity problem with the movie is you are puzzled how you could possibly have missed what wild lives Bobby and Donna were living right from episode 1.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

But of course, the story isn't over. This is literally only the beginning, and many of the questions raised by the show and this movie are actually answered pretty neatly in The Return (in Lynch's own way, of course).As frustrating as it can be, this might be the most important piece of the puzzle that is Twin Peaks.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

In fact, it is some of those cultists who were most infuriated by this. Yes, it's all the absurd brutality and strangeness of Peaks without any of the ironic humor or quaint characters. However, if you go into this film without any foreknowledge of the Twin Peaks experience, I would imagine you would be overcome with the same feelings as people who ""enjoyed"" Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive."" As a stand alone film, this is a brilliantly conceived puzzle-box/mobius strip of celluloid art. Yes, it is a mystery, and yes, it doesn't make any sense (which it really does if you think about it, and then doesn't when you think again), and yes, it is art. This is also not for the faint of heart.

48,asda-man,Lynch rocks!,10,10 November 2013,"It's easy to see why Fire Walk With Me flopped. The TV studio messed around with series 2, putting it on at different times so eventually very few people could actually catch up with it. They also pressured David Lynch and Mark Frost to reveal Laura's killer (who was never supposed to be revealed) too early. All of these cock-ups resulted in the show being tragically cancelled and panned. However, David Lynch didn't want to end it all there, and wished to explore more of his fascinating, almost martyr-like character, Laura Palmer. The girl who was the name on everyone's lips throughout the show. Unfortunately though no one seemed to get the visual reference in the opening of the film, where a TV blows up, thus the film received a cold reception. It goes in a different, darker direction to the TV series and ties up very few loose ends which no one seemed to like. However, I'm sure that if people opened their minds and expected something darker in tone, then they would've found a lot to like. Because I found plenty.I loved Twin Peaks, especially its masterfully nightmarish finale and also love David Lynch. I think he's one of the greatest directors of all time. He understands that film is a true form of art, thus he creates incredible moods in his films. They're more like experiences, and aren't supposed to be fully understood. Half the time he does something surreal because it ""feels right"" and it really does! Fire Walk With Me is a surreal near-masterpiece. If it was an episode, then it would by far be the best. It rightly leaves the show's comedy elements behind and delves down an incredibly dark and often sad path. It's not very often that I say a film over two hours didn't feel long enough, but here I can proudly say that. Fire Walk With Me just seemed to get better and better as it went on.The film opens strangely. It introduces two new detective characters, investigating a suspiciously similar murder to Laura's in a suspiciously similar town to Twin Peaks. However, this town isn't the charming town that Twin Peaks is. It's a much grimier, darker and depressed land where every place has adverse names. The locals are also weirder and angrier, which is understandable if they live in a caravan site called, ""Fat Trout Trailer Park"". It's a suitably strange opening that seems to have little to do with the film that follows. Nevertheless it is very interesting and evokes a strange atmosphere, just like Twin Peaks did. The film also reaches its surrealist high point which I won't spoil. All I'll say is that it features the wonderful Dale Cooper, David Bowie, a security camera and the black lodge to a seriously unsettling effect. The film is full of strange moments, but this is one of the most frightening.After this though, the film really starts. It's one year later and we see the iconic Twin Peaks sign alongside Angelo Badalamenti's incredible score... It feels like we're back home. However, Fire Walk With Me presents Twin Peaks as a much more sinister town. We don't get comic relief from supporting characters, we just become immersed in Laura Palmer's world. Despite being dead in the series, Laura was always the most interesting character and here we really get to delve into her wonderful character. There's a very sad atmosphere throughout the film, because we know how it's all going to end. Laura's life is really quite a mad one. She's basically a cocaine-addicted prostitute, yet she's only a girl who's crying out for help. No one really knows her, not even her best friend Donna who is the opposite of the seductive Laura.Fire Walk With Me is full of masterful sequences. Of course there are those wonderful dream scenes which David does so well, but there are also some intense moments too. One of my favourite moments is when Leland is toying with Laura at the dinner table. The atmosphere is so suffocating in that scene, it's so powerful. Laura's final moments are also very dark and powerful stuff. The splashes of heavy surrealism and symbolism also make the film even deeper, richer and sensuous. Who exactly is BOB? Is he real, or is he a metaphor for the evil inside us? What is the black lodge? Who is The Man From Another Place? All of these elements (and many more) serve to make Fire Walk With Me a memorable and unsettling experience.The complaints I have with the film are minor. I would've liked more scenes with BOB because I just think he's such a fascinating and frankly frightening villain. I also would've liked more evidence of the love between Laura and James Hurley, but this doesn't hurt the film much at all. Fire Walk With Me is a flawed masterpiece from David Lynch. it's got a strong nightmarish atmosphere and is full of amazing immersing moments such as the hypnotic stroboscopic bar scene. It's a wonderful companion piece to the series. Fire Walk With Me is a strange and unforgettable journey which really gets under your skin and stays there. I thought the ending was pretty much perfect. Tragically sad and powerful, yet strangely hopeful. I'll look forward to experiencing it all again, as I thin it's something that will get better with repeated viewings.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
49,Rickting,"An interesting work, but not as good as the TV show",7,31 August 2016,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is the prequel to the Twin Peaks TV show, which depicts the last 7 days in the life of Laura Palmer. Twin Peaks was an awesome show and the upcoming revival is something to anticipate hugely. The film is a different thing. It's darker and more adult, the wonderful theme tune from the program only appears once, many of the characters from the show, including Dale Cooper, are barely in it and this overall is far more of a horror film. If you thought the TV show was baffling, wait until you see this. It's a hugely confusing film with many things that feel rushed or incomplete, while not only does Dale Cooper get completely marginalized, but he seems more subdued than he was before. The subtle explanation of what happened in the series finale is appreciated though. The film is as brilliantly made as one would expect from David Lynch, and is filled to the brim with his deliriously insane cinematic skill. It's a disturbing film as well, and despite its craziness perhaps what it truly is in the end is a surreal examination of the trials and difficulties of adolescence. Still, as a film, it feels incomplete, overly open and too many characters from the show are either missing or reduced to distantly seen cameos. Sheryl Lee is good as Laura Palmer, but some of the other acting, especially Moira Kelly as Donna Hayward, is really bad. This is undoubtedly a flawed effort, but it's an underrated and interesting movie that still has plenty to say. 7/10",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

On the other hand, you may want to watch it over and over again to try to figure it out, or watch the series.Although the film starts with a body floating in the river and the mysterious disappearance of an FBI agent, the gist of the film is in regard to the final days of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). Laura may have the looks of a homecoming queen, but she is far from innocent: she's a chain-smoking, coke-snorting, hussy. Anyone can tell you that leading this type of double-life will lead to a dead end. And the catalyst involves her father Leland Palmer (Ray Wise)and the mysterious Bob (Frank Silva).Any Lynch fan knows and expects some weird imagery and even weirder characters.

54,squeezebox,"Very Good, though parts are better than the whole",7,24 January 2003,"This uneven, but nevertheless fascinating companion piece (not really a sequel or prequel) to David Lynch's hit TV series will most likely appeal more to die hard Lynch addicts than fans of the show. It starts out with a captivating prologue in which two FBI agents (Chris Isaak, Keifer Sutherland) investigate the murder of a young woman a year before Laura Palmer's death. The remainder of the film follows Laura (Sheryl Lee, in a superb performance) for the final week of her life, and the many odd and nightmarish experiences she has along the way. Lynch creates some haunting imagery, and several surreal sequences rank among his best work, particularly an intense sequence in a nightclub where the music is so loud we need subtitles to tell what the characters are saying.However, the movie is a narrative disaster: characters and events pop up and disappear with little or no explanation (David Bowie's bewildering walk-on is the most glaring example of this), and many scenes seem incomplete. Who is the battered old woman who wanders into Teresa Banks' trailer? What does Carl mean when he says, ""I've already gone places?"" What's the deal with the monkey? What ""matters"" when James says to Laura, ""It does matter, we're in love?"" Lynch does not answer any of these questions. In Lynch's next movie, LOST HIGHWAY, he also left many questions unanswered, but gave his audience enough information to figure it out for themselves. He does not do so in FWWM, and much is left unresolved.Despite this, it's a good film with some great moments. Just don't think about it too much.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
55,ozthegreatat42330,This Lynch fails to satisfy.,6,27 April 2007,"I will state from the outset that I was one of the original Twin Peaks fanatics. The quirky show, it's very talented cast, and the masterful creation by David Lynch and Mark Frost was excellent and I hated to see it come to an end. When this film was announced I could hardly wait. But sadly, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk WIth Me is a cop-out. It is a chance to offer cheap thrills with a R rating for simulated sex and bear breasts, and the story does not live up to it's predecessor. And that is a damn shame. It starts out well enough. But from the disappearance of Special Agent Desmond on it loses out on some excellent possibilities. Kiefer Sutherland's character for instance, takes off to Portland with the body of Teresa Banks, and is never heard from again. His was a wasted role in the film. Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle Machlachlan) who I always enjoy watching shows up and the next thing we have jumped ahead a year to the week before Laura Palmer's death. This was most certainly not the Twin Peaks film I wanted to see. If you liked it, of course that is your business. But I would have loved to see more of the agent's backgrounds for one. Like the death of Windham Earle's wife, for which Dale Cooper was so guilt ridden. But then I supposed it takes all kinds, so go for it. I rate it a six.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
56,x_manicure_x,Let's forget of Twin Peaks Season 2,7,14 August 2021,"David Lynch tries to rewrite ""Twin Peaks"" history and atone for the mess that Season 2 caused by making this prequel. The film is about things that we already know, but there are so many poignant moments and beautifully unsettling images that make this a must-see. It's pretty much what the series was supposed to be before losing its identity, and an important chapter retrospectively as many symbolic elements here provide essential hints to understand ""The Return"" 25 years later.Laura Palmer's spleen and inner conflicts are masterfully depicted here, especially once she becomes aware of how things are starting to degenerate. This film is an excellent example of the unique way Lynch is able to create a disturbing atmosphere by twisting apparently familiar situations with unnatural lines, odd acting, and subtle details. Credit also goes to how frightening Ray Wise's Leland Palmer feels this time. He had a couple of great moments in the series too but he definitely shines here. On the other hand, Sheryl Lee's continuous wailing and screaming were a bit too annoying to take. Overacting is a common feature in Twin Peaks, but I think she went a bit too far with that.I would not recommend this to people who are not familiar with the show or want to start their journey to Twin Peaks, as the role of Bob & Friends is not clearly explained, and most references and supporting characters would just feel superfluous.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

58,ilpohirvonen,Inner Demons of Existence,8,31 May 2014,"This review might contain spoilers of the TV-series ""Twin Peaks"", but not of the film itself. ""Twin Peaks"" is a true cult phenomenon with a mythology of its own. Its eccentric humor, blue atmosphere and portrayal of the dark side of human life have all had an essential impact on the Lynch universe and its aesthetics. Thus it doesn't come as a surprise that director David Lynch found it suiting to continue the series with a feature film ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"" (1992). Although the film offered a lot of the elements which fans of the show wanted, such as Badalamenti's score, the return of their favorite milieu and characters; and dramatization of some of the scenes of the past, it came as a disappointment and became a financial and critical flop. It is easy to judge afterwards, but it seems to me that this was only due to audience expectations and not the actual substance of Lynch's film. The film consists of two distinctly different parts. The first tells about an incident outside of Twin Peaks which might have a connection with the murder of Laura Palmer. The second, which takes place about a year later, focuses on the final week in the life of Laura Palmer. The film has a heavy, melancholic atmosphere reminiscent of the TV-series, but at the same time it lacks the humor of the show as a balance, which was probably responsible for the alienation of many people from the film. Yet I beg to differ. The absence of humor is partially due to the shift from TV to cinema but also the subject matter; that is not the idyllic surface, but what lies beneath. In other words, the film is meant to be watched after the series even if it was a so-called prequel. Since when it comes to the final episodes of ""Twin Peaks"", the film is very similar mood- wise. Although the film consists of two parts, its main focus is on the second one. In this part we meet Laura Palmer as a disturbed person who takes drugs and has serious mood swings. The film grows into a tale of her unending drowning into existential abyss. It must be stressed once more that the series has to be watched first because it is there where Lynch destroyed the image of Laura Palmer, and therefore it remains for the film to portray the life behind the image. An important observation is that psychology doesn't concern Lynch. The possibilities of social pressure or mental problems in the account of Laura Palmer are secondary, external factors such as the interpretation of her father as a schizophrenic. These are elements emerging from Lynch's treatise on something else. For it is the human mind which puzzles him, but not from the viewpoint of a psychologist. Lynch studies the inner demons of existence. Although inner, these demons aren't necessarily merely subjective. They can be inter-subjective and thus Lynch's cinema in general isn't just concerned with private fear and anxiety. It is about something shared in human existence. In addition to the lack of humor, the lack of explanation might have been one of the reasons which turned contemporary viewers off. Yet I think anyone with some sense will agree with me that this isn't the right way to go and watch ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"". Lynch doesn't care to explain himself and neither should the viewer care to try to solve the mystery. There is no mystery except the same mystery which haunts every one of us who exist. Perhaps all the audience wanted was a continuum for the series. They wanted to experience the same which they loved once. But that's not art: that's factory-like industry. Instead of just immersing back into the world of Twin Peaks (which was arguably among Lynch's reasons to make this film), Lynch has created many new elements to the film. One of these is the white noise of a television screen. This noise embodies not only the idyll to whose parental embrace the people lull themselves into but also the truth beneath the surface of reality. It's a noise that can't be hidden with another noise.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
59,fil-nik09,Hmmm...,6,5 March 2016,"The film on its own is not as good ( or nearly as good) as the series - although the second season was - more or less - after the killer of Laura Palmer was revealed - rather uninspiring.I rate it as six. I guess the rating would be even less if I did not see the entire series and all episodes and did not like it . ( I rated the Twin Peaks series an eight).I liked that we got the chance to see what Laura rally was before the murder and what was going on. Some parts of the mystery surrounding her were lifted up. Too bad the 'real' Donna is not in the film. And even more shame Audrey is not there too.I find that the first part of the movie where the murder of a girl from a year before is invastigated is quite iseless per se.

The film merely portrays events that were discussed throughout the two seasons. While the first half of the film is engrossing, the second part depicting the last week of Laura Palmer's life is extremely slow and - not that this is a negative, a warning rather - completely unaccessible for anyone who has not watched the series. It was great to see the original cast return, but the absence of the actress who played Donna in the series was a real distraction. Overall, this critically-slated big screen production of ""Twin Peaks"" is inaccessible for first-time viewers, and the lack of anything new to ponder on or experience leaves it redundant for the fans.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
61,Rendanlovell,Not Lynch's best but certainly not his worst,7,8 May 2020,"What a trip this movie is. Even if you're not a fan of Twin Peaks this kinda works simply based on how bizarre and surreal it is. It's 2 hours of strange visuals, strange sequences, and even stranger choices. There's so many scenes that feel cut down or slapped together. Yet, there still is a narrative through line that makes some amount of sense. You get a psuedo epilogue following the investigation of a murdered girl in a slimy town. Then you get into the real meat of the story which follows Laura Palmer. Although it doesn't seem to connect much to the prologue, it sets the tone perfectly for the Laura Palmer show. Which is a somber, disturbing character study about a girl that is in way over her head. She's a drug addict, she sells her body, and is tormented by a mysterious figure named BOB. Who she says wants to inhabit or kill her. We watch as she spirals out of control until we get to her inevitable downfall. Sheryl Lee is superb and really carries this movie. I think overall this works as a haunting character piece. Or you could view this as a portrait on drug addiction and it affects you. That said, if you aren't a Twin Peaks fan this all may amount to nothing more then strange visuals and choppy editing. It's definitely messy but it is an interesting mess.

62,refresh_daemon,"I enjoyed it, but I can't love it",7,7 October 2006,"So, I'd never seen the television series before watching this film. But because it was said that having a foreknowledge of the series is good for this film, I went ahead and read the basic plot and character spoilers on Wikipedia before getting into this film.My immediate impression of this film is that it has that very noticeable David Lynch vibe from the very start. The way the movie is lit, the camera direction, the acting--all of those aspects shared similarities with the other Lynch film that I'd seen, the trippy Mulholland Drive. I guess the man's imprint is indelible. I suppose I should check out another Lynch film to make sure it's not isolated incidences.Anyway, like the other mentioned film, this one is quite surreal, although surprisingly grounded. It features the story of Laura Palmer, the murdered highschooler in the television series and what happened that caused her to die. Along the way, we meet the inhabitants of the small town of Twin Peaks. And the story unravels itself.First of all, you really do need to have seen the series to get much out of this film. I had to pause the film and look up characters and such in order to make sense of exactly what was going on at times. There are some pretty strange additional characters as well, portraying the strange otherworldly beings that inhabit the town of Twin Peaks. And then there are the regular strange inhabitants of Twin Peaks as well.Of course, all the supernatural stuff is fine and good. The artistic direction in this film is remarkably strong and sometimes Lynch pulls some impressive and surprising performances out of his actors. The story is surreal, but certainly not as crazy as what I've seen from surrealists like Luis Bunuel and it's not too hard to get a grasp of the motifs that are running through the film. There is evil and there is good and there are secrets and there are fronts. That's good.But I had some problems with the film. First of all, the opening chunk of the film is dominated by an investigation into the death of a different character. This wouldn't be a problem if it was shorter, but it was significantly long and changing gears into a completely different story left a lot of problems. Second, I know that the Agent Cooper character was central to the television series, but in this film, he served as a time-waster. We didn't need to see him or any of the FBI at all. They could easily have been excised to help keep the film moving along.The other is that, although the supernatural mystery is fine, a little more exploration into it would've been nice. And that really leads into the second problem with this film. It really should be able to stand by itself. Perhaps if it was lumped with the rest of the series, it might be fine, but as it stands, the film doesn't hold steady. No one should have to carry an episode guide and character list in order to make sense of the film, as well as an explanation of the supernatural forces that are at work in Twin Peaks.But that said, some of the moments in the film are remarkable. Especially the interaction between Laura and her father Leland. The terror that exists is palpable and it makes one of the moments, where Leland gets his head straight briefly, that much more potent. It's not naturally acted--it's almost got a soapish feel to it, but despite that, it's still emotionally convincing--and that's saying a lot.But it still can't save the film from its problems. And for that, I have to say that I enjoyed it, but I can't love it. 7/10.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
63,patriciogl10,I never thought I'd enjoy being left with so many questions unanswered.,9,18 October 2018,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me unveils the horrid details of Laura Palmer's spiraling out of control, due to heavy drug use and careless promiscuity, ultimately culminating in her murder. The homecoming queen's last week of her life is documented, uncovering the mystery surrounding her death. It is really hard for me to imagine a Twin Peaks fan not liking this film. For it presents something we've all wanted to see produced visually, exploring further the relationship between Laura and several different characters, such as Bobby (Dana Ashbrook), James (James Marshall), Donna (Moira Kelly) and Leland Palmer (Ray Wise). It's a wonderful addition to the universe of Twin Peaks and its everlasting aura of mystery and bizarreness.The film also features a different storyline concerning the investigation of a murdered waitress Teresa Banks in a small Washington town. The investigation is carried out by FBI agent Chet Desmond (Chris Isaak) and his partner Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland). Then agent Desmond disappears and we don't hear from him again, since the film does not offer a resolution to his plot. I read somewhere that this was planned to be resolved on future installments of TP but since this movie proved to be a complete failure at the box office, it was never even developed.There is a bit of Agent Cooper, but mostly everything is focused more on Laura's life and her realization of who was after her, prompting to her disgrace and fateful end. But there are still so many questions left unanswered.
So many things waiting for light to be shed on them. I guarantee that watching this movie will only make you want to be continuously immersed in this beautiful and nightmarish universe. So, your next stop is Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces and of course Twin Peaks: The Return. Oh boy, after you watch those your head will explode!I desperately feel the need to mention Sheryl Lee's performance. Superb, outstanding, truly remarkable. Great range and versatility. Her ability to convey so many different emotions is just amazing. Nothing but a round of applause.What a magnificent work of art. I guess that all we have to do is enjoy, think, question and simply thank David Lynch and Mark Frost for their excellent creation.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

I never expected to be bored watching a Lynch film, but this one did it to me. I did finally ""get it"" after seeing it for what I think was the second or third time since its release -- it's weird enough that it may take time to filter through the usual mental screens that serve to filter out this sort of nonsense. If you're new to Lynch, I suggest you 'de-virginize' with one of his other films, perhaps Blue Velvet.Not up to Lynch's usual standards, this one's an exercise in self-indulgence that could make even the most ostentatious filmmaker start blushing.

65,ArmandoManuelPereira,"Spooky, Intense And Grim At Times, But Not A Great Lynch Film. More Of An OK Lynch Film",6,30 May 2020,"(1st viewing) 7/10I feel as if I should dislike this movie. In Mullholland Drive, another Lynch film I watched, I was forced to admit that its weirdness was all ultimately entertaining. In the same way after finishing watching Fire Walk With Me, it would have been ingenuous for me to deny that its combination of horror and tragedy wasn't entertaining somehow. I'm just not willing to say that its a truly great film. Not yet, anyways.We are taken deeply into the life of Laura Palmer, who is leading a destructive, hidden life of drugs and prostitution. We also learn that from a young age she had been subjected to sexaul abuse by a spirit named BOB, who possesses her father. Most of the movie chronicles her grim and weirdly horrible life, in the week leading up to her death. At the end though redemption is waiting, and Laura is presented as having found peace.(2nd viewing) 5/10Watching this 2nd time I felt mysrlf more critically aware of what was happening in the story. It seems to start off sluggish, then eventually finds a groove. Which is weird and violent Though the weirdness is at times amusing, it's not always.. The actress Sheryl Lee provides an unususl performance that somehow convinces us of Lauras torment and despair, and is one of the movies strengths. The ending unfortunately seems to speed up a little too fast and feels chaotic, and not in a good way. Ultimately, I brought my rating down ywo notches from 7 to 5. Still worth watching, but its fllaws prevent it from being a great Lynch film, in my opinion. Its more like an ok Lynch film.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Then it becomes apparent that this film is going to be abstruse. Soon after this the other two agents disappear inexplicably and then we are introduced to the central figure, Laura Palmer, played well by Sheryl Lee, who we find has a dark side, which includes taking cocaine and prostitution. She is also troubled by visions of a demonic figure. Some of the other sequences involve a strange little man and a one-armed man and a bizarre brief cameo from David Bowie. It is difficult to explain the purpose of these characters but that is where the film succeeds with its stylish and surreal aberrations, another example being a scene in a bar where we can't hear the characters speak and the film is slowed down with strobe lighting effects. It concludes with seemingly a theme of salvation and it is a very stylish and surreal film.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
69,jay4stein79-1,Unjustly Maligned,9,1 April 2006,"Fire Walk With Me, the prequel to Lynch's Twin Peaks, is an unjustly maligned masterpiece, which, though it lacks the raw energy of Blue Velvet or the maturity of Mulholland Dr. and The Straight Story, is nevertheless among the man's best work. It's also as bizarre as Eraserhead; he just happened to have a more sure directorial hand at this point in time. The opening section, involving Chester Desmond and the search for Teresa Banks is, probably, one of the best pieces of film-making that Lynch has ever produced. It's funny, surreal, and terrifying (those scenes in the trailer park give me the heebie jeebies just thinking about them). Lil the Dancer is also a brilliant addition (and Lynch's performance as Gordon Cole is luminous as well, but we knew that already from his appearances on the television show). The rest of the movie is no slouch either. It's a fascinating dissection of what we've already seen, in part, in the television show--the disintegration of the Palmer family. In Fire Walk With Me, though, there's more emotion (told as it is from the family's perspective and not the Agent Cooper's) and more release. The film is a sad one, despite its uses of irony and the absurd, which is what separates it from the television show. That Fire Walk With Me has feeling, I think, it what places it in the upper-echelon of Lynch's films. His best films have emotion--and very visceral emotion--while his weaker films feel, as Roger Ebert described Lost Highway, ""like kissing a mirror.""",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

A woman is thrown out of a boxcar, another one is stabbed to death by a maniacal man, an angel keeps appearing and disappearing, something about a motorcycle, everybody is supposed to be either crazy or on drugs, dialog that sounds like a bad parody of a bad Beatnik movie, the female protagonist's emotions doing 180s every minute or so until you can predict what she's gonna do or say in the next scene merely by predicting the opposite of what she did or said in the last scene.  A transparently loathsome piece of work. You're in this movie's target market if you're the sort of person who pretends to be amused by certain unamusing things in order not to seem out-of-it to other people who are pretending to amused by the same unamusing things so as not to seem out-of-it to you.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
71,quinimdb,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,9,13 June 2016,"""Fire Walk With Me"" is what ""Twin Peaks"" built to in its 2 seasons on the air. It's much, much darker and more depressing than the TV show, but it's also more, surreal, terrifying, spiritual, and powerful. It's got the same initial feeling as the TV show. It feels slightly offbeat right off the bat with the screaming Gordon Cole, and then it only gets stranger with the dancing woman in the red dress, and despite cheesy moments like the waiting room for the police department that the two agents go to, there are disturbing moments such as when the two agents perform an autopsy on Teresa Banks' dead body and find a letter under her fingernail. The town they visit seems to have many secrets, especially One of the two detectives finds a ring, and from here the film cuts to one year later in Twin Peaks and it shows a seemingly innocent and stereotypical high school and it's inhabitants. However, the film transitions into a sort of character study of Laura Palmer, the girl who is dead for all of the TV series. The seemingly innocent appearance suddenly takes a turn when we see Laura snort cocaine. We learn more about Laura and her abusive, rapist father who seems normal at first glance. Bob is simply a metaphor for the evil that can live in those close to us that can go unnoticed by most. Laura cares for her friend Donna, and she loves James, but she knows that they are good people and they are not like her, and she doesn't want them to be like her. She is aware that she is too far gone into prostitution and her drug addiction and there is no going back now, and she knows she will die soon. Her boyfriend, Bobby, she doesn't seem to care for much, and it seems she is with him only for cocaine. But Bobby loves her, and what first seems like the usual high school ""bad boy"", in both the show and this film, actually turns out to be scared and desperate, especially in one depressing scene in which he murders a man that almost kills him in a drug deal. Being stuck in the black lodge is simply a metaphor for her and her father's inability to escape the evil inside them, no matter how much they want to be rid of it. But as the end of the film suggests, Laura Palmer reunited with her angels after death, and it seems she is sent to the white lodge, or heaven.There is much more to be explored in this film thematically, and there are many surreal moments with are worth looking into again.

73,NateManD,"Forget about what critics said, and take a visit to Twin Peaks.",8,3 August 2005,"""Twin Peaks: Fire walk with me"" was trashed by critics. Even the AFI put it on its list of top 100 stinkers (worst movies). I totally disagree with the critics and AFI. I feel that ""Twin Peaks: Fire walk with me"" is definitely a strange and unique masterpiece as only David Lynch could conjure up. The movie is a prequel to the show and deals with the bizarre disappearance of an FBI agent and later traces the final hours of Laura Palmer's life. At times it is very psychological and dark. We get to know more about Laura (Sheryl Lee) including her drug addiction, sex life and the dirty secrets of her family. We also see a slightly different side of her best friend Donna (originally played by Lara Flynn Boyle, but she turned down the part due to nudity) In order to understand the story better, Laura's father can best be compared to Bill Pullman's character in ""Lost Highway"". This film is dark, disturbing, violent, mesmerizing and filled with dream like images that still haunt me. ""Twin Peaks: fire walk with me is a cult masterpiece; regardless of what critics have said. Not to mention, the first half hour is somewhat humorous in a Lynch like way. In order for the film to make sense, watch the complete ""Twin Peaks"" series first before viewing the film",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
74,wandereramor,"Cold, like a turkey",8,8 July 2014,"After the cancellation of Twin Peaks, there were a lot of questions left unresolved and the series's general meaning was unclear. The fans that had remained through the show's second-season decline doubtlessly wanted a conclusion to the show's many narrative strands. A feature film could have provided a sense of closure, as with future cult TV shows Firefly and Veronica Mars. But of course, David Lynch has never been one to give people what they want.Fire Walk with Me is a prequel, and one that doesn't really provide any information about Laura Palmer's death that isn't revealed in the first half of the TV series. As such, it's inessential even for fans of the show, and at times can feel like a rehash of old material (especially in the first half hour, another quirky detective investigating another murdered young girl).So why watch Fire Walk With Me? Well, there are some fun appearances by the likes of David Bowie, Kiefer Sutherland and Harry Dean Stanton. But more importantly, the film pares down the supernatural tangents and weird townspeople that littered the TV series. Those things had their value, but they eventually made the murder of Laura Palmer a half- forgotten conceit. As in so many murder mysteries, the actual murder victim becomes inessential. In Fire Walk With Me, that violence takes centre stage. We see Laura Palmer's world, a world of constant sexual violence and her futile attempts to cope by owning the depravity. It's Lynch at his bleakest, and it's genuinely unsettling in the way that, say, the Log Lady is not. Rather than being the story of a strange small town, Fire Walk With Me tells the story of Twin Peaks as a story about a girl who is repeatedly raped and eventually murdered, and there's absolutely nothing charming about that.It might just be because I was less focused on deciphering the plot, but Lynch's style seems heightened in comparison with the TV series and even some of the other movies he made around this time. The story unfolds in a kind of jazz-like alternation between absurdity, kitsch and horror. There isn't really a plot, but nevertheless I couldn't turn my eyes away. The return to horror makes Fire Walk With Me a worthy companion to the original series, and much more worthy of a revisit than some of those season 2 episodes.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
75,pekinman,It's not the Twin Peaks TV show!,8,7 July 2008,"'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' is not for the faint-hearted, unlike the 'Twin Peaks' TV series which was another thing altogether. For those who aren't familiar with the original brilliant television series it is essential to watch that before 'Fire Walk With Me' even though this film is called the ""prequel"" to the TV show. There are several reasons for this. The most important is that the sweetness with its underlying darkness and mystery of the TV show lays a solid foundation to prepare you for this utterly dark, violent and frightening feature film. The memory of the original series makes this film all the more poignant in its deep sadness. If you expect this film to be anything like its predecessor you will be deeply disappointed, but if you go to it with an open mind, remembering other Lynch films for the big screen, you will be highly satisfied. This film goes beyond 'Blue Velvet' in its violence and brutality and also possesses the element of surreal nightmare to be found in 'Mulholland Drive' and 'Lost Highway'. I think 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' is AS good as those two great Lynch films and was dissed by the critics at its release because they wanted more quirky and humorous material ala 'Twin Peaks'.Lynch is in top form here. Angelo Badalamenti's music haunts the memory for days afterwards, as he always does. The strobe-lights, the red room and other Lynch icons are well in evidence. Most of the characters from the show are in the film, but not all and most of them have minor roles to play. Even Special Agent Dale Cooper is a VERY minor character.The show is carried almost entirely on the shoulders of Sheryl Lee who turns in a tour-de- force performance as the doomed Laura Palmer. She is one of our greatest actresses and I am surprised she does not appear in more major films. I hope Lynch will find another leading role for her in his future work.The climax of this film is quite violent and difficult to watch at times but it ends on one of the most sublime notes that has come from Lynch, underpinned by the moving music of Luigi Cherubini's Requiem in c minor.Essential watching for all Lynch fans and also for lovers of great film in general.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
76,howie73,A mess,5,29 January 2007,"I admire David Lynch's films but TP FWWM is a step too far. The film is a confused and confusing mess; a vain, self-indulgent attempt to reignite the hitherto successful franchise that was Twin Peaks. Unlike Mulholland Drive which successfully cast aside its TV roots, FWWM can't escape the burden of its televisual origins. Here Lynch has fashioned a messy prologue and epilogue to TP, destroying the enigma of Laura Palmer's death; and herein lies the problem with FWWM; it's simply too literal and overt for Lynch. There are some wildly inventive and unforgettable scenes but there are also too many scenes that flounder in their self-indulgence; scenes were muffled dialogue tries the patience of viewers. It's a slap in the face for viewers, one that insults our investment in the film.The other central flaw is the structure. The dual story of Teresa Banks and Laura Palmer is clumsily told; and it often seems Lynch has fashioned two films in the first hour, bridging them together later on. The genesis of the film's turbulent production is also evident in the gluing of these two films together, and the haphazard use of Special Agent Dale Cooper role just doesn't work. Another flaw is Sheryl Lee's portrayal of Laura Palmer. As befits many Lynchian figures, she is a curious entity, torn between innocence and desire, but as is usual for most Lynchian characters, she lacks empathy and sympathy. It doesn't help that Sheryl lee overacts in a hysterical fashion which was probably the intention but it's still unintentionally hilarious to watch.It's not all bad though. The framing is excellent as well as the audio. I know there is a campaign to restore this film to its original glory but it seems what can only save this film is to re-edit it further.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

79,unakaczynski,My first experience with Twin Peaks,8,30 December 2005,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me Noir/Murder Mystery/Fantasy I had never seen anything ""Twin Peaks"" related before, but had always heard about how weird the show was. In the last year, I've had an increasing interest in David Lynch films and lo and behold, on cable, I had the chance to catch this little gem. This is billed as the ""prequel"" to the ""Twin Peaks"" television show. Ha, and you don't even need to worry at all about spoilers here, I seriously doubt I really got what was going on.This film is about the town of Twin Peaks wherein a girl was found murdered. And for whatever reason, the FBI has taken an interest in the case and they sent, of all people, Chris Isaak to investigate. Eventually, to replace him, Lynch constant, Kyle McLaughlin wanders into the story to investigate. But he plays, as usual, a very odd person who's humanity can never really be spotted. The film also follows closely the story of an exceptionally ""loose"" girl as she bounds around town doing as many drugs and men as she can. All the while, she appears to have some issues with her father. And everyone has issues with bizarre dreams, hallucinations, and flashbacks.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--Well, the acting is quite interesting, and pretty good. --Excessively bizarre story and charactersall really interesting and attention-grabbing. But strange none-the-less. The story bounds frantically around, as one would expect in a Lynch film, and becomes almost more an art piece than a film.--Brilliant atmosphere and cinematography. But then, who would expect anything less from Lynch? Tension is carried along with rampant strength and it's hard to take your eyes off the screen for several moments during the film.--Nice special effects when we have them, and a decent amount of nudity.--For those who like weirdness, this film has it in spades. From the backwards talking dream sequences with the little guy, to the wacky sex-n-drugs club the main girl meanders into. --Some pretty good violence, and some nice shocking surprises. And some disturbing ones--I'm generally not a fan of musicians, pop stars or the like appearing in movies. To me, it's Hollywood pandering to the fanbase of those people desperate for higher ticket sales. These people are not actors and for our modern times, I'm flat out sick of seeing Rap stars popping up in filmsgranted, Redman actually did a good job in ""Seed of Chucky"" and wasn't trying to play the ""tough black guy"" or the ""comic relief black guy""but this sh*t is getting old. Here, however, Chris Isaak manages to act quite well and suits his part better than I could have thought. David Bowie wasn't prancing, acting, singing, or dancing (thank god) and popped up briefly just to be the human oddity that he is. (Oh, and Iggy Pop in ""Dead Man"" also did well.)Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--For me the jazz/noir music dominating the early part of the film was extremely tedious, but some people will likely enjoy it. Decent mood setter, I suppose. There are moments of better, though loud and strange, music during a scene in a club.The Bad:--This movie is beyond strange, so much so that many people will have trouble following it, or even for that matter, getting into it. So, it's for a specific audience. And audience that likes their entertainment as weird as can be. Luckily for me, I like stuff like that.--The beginning is rather plodding and takes a bit to pick up. But at least you ladies have Chris Isaak to ogle. The Ugly:--The main girl in this movie sure gets around a lot. And her taste in men is all over the placeone would think she'd be able to do someone better than a fat redneckMemorable Scene:--When the female protagonist finds someone in her roomWatch For:--David Bowie, Miguel Ferrer, Heather Graham & David Lynch in small roles.A Note About the Influence of Twin Peaks:--I'm sure we've all seen the ""Simpsons"" episode(s) recalling Twin Peaks, like the unicorn dancing with someone. But here's one many of you will likely not know: The Death Metal band Konkhra has three songs which, at least appear to be, about this film, and possibly Twin Peaks in general. Bands are famous for sampling single lines here and there from movies, but Konkhra's interest lies in these three tracks: Inhuman, Pain and Sorrow (segue), and My Belief. Pain and Sorrow connects the other two tracks and is about two minutes of constant sampling from this film, including inspiration from the music. These tracks are from the ""Weed Out the Weak"" album.Acting: 8/10 Story: 8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Character Development: 7/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 8/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 5/10 (some nudity and disturbing sexual stuff) Violence/Gore: 6/10 (very little gore) Dialogue: 8/10 (a lot of backwards talking and subtitles) Music: 6/10 Direction: 8/10 Cheesiness: 1/10 Crappiness: 1/10 Overall: 8/10So, there you have my two cents on Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. I thought it was a good movie and extremely interesting. However, it's also weird as all hell and not for everyone. Pretty much for Twin Peaks and David Lynch fans or fanatics. (Keep in mind, the opinions of dedicated fans of the Twin Peaks series may have better insight than mine on this film.)(www.ResidentHazard.com)",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
80,Michael Kenmore,Most incomprehensibly bizarre film ever made. Worse than 1984 Dune.,1,29 August 2005,"I'm familiar with David Lynch's style, but I don't consider him a real auteur. His ""interesting"" filmography resembles the body of work by a lifelong film student who took too much LSD and got away with messing with the viewers' mind like an elaborate mind-game hoax conducted by a prankster. That in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing. Quite the opposite; I enjoy weird films (David Fincher's Alien 3, Jeunet's City of Lost Children and Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys) as long as there's story & characterization with a good dose of comprehensibility, no matter how absurd the plot may seem on the surface.What's bad about David Lynch's film style is his uniquely weird vision borders on incomprehensible to the point of reprehensibility & frustrated rage inspired in the viewers who make the mistake of erring into Lynch territory not knowing what they're in for.I've seen the pointlessly repulsive Blue Velvet & idiotically confounding Dune (though the latter was not David's fault to a certain extent) among a handful of Lynch films yet unseen by me. The only film I mildly liked is The Elephant Man, despite its ridiculous speculations & inaccuracies like the title protagonist's wrong first name. I'm a great admirer of The Straight Story, probably the first and last non-weird film Lynch directed.I rented Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me out of curiosity for its cult status attained by wall-to-wall bizarre imagery that makes for a scary horror movie. Unfortunately, this is not the case. What I saw was a ludicrously incomprehensible mess that's even worse than Dune.David made this film for the sake of making a massively pretentious student film to push the viewers' buttons to see what provoke them in varied emotional responses. For me it's sheer boredom & frustrated rage trying to understand what is the point of the movie's plot amid the array of weird images & nonsensical dialogue and one-dimensional characters that jump in and out of the picture in frequent intervals.David was out of his mind throwing common sense & logic in reality out the window when he did this movie. That Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me doesn't make sense at all whatsoever speaks for itself that David was a whacked out hack auteur who thought he could outdo Ed Wood and John Waters by making a film as ridiculously inaccessible as possible, thereby limiting the audience reception in order to make it a cult film strictly for those who find merit in examining the film for being totally unorthodox in plot.I feel bad for the actors in the movie that turned out so terrible. The mystery of Laura Palmer, the basis of the acclaimed television series that preceded the film, is a fabricated fantasy conjured up by David Lynch and his writers only to have it ""solved"" in the film with the most ludicrously contrived plot device yet devised. The actress Sherlyn Lee - who played the victim-protagonist Laura Palmer - was used like a worn-out porn star in a B-movie exploitation filled with gloriously bad parody of 70's high school films with T&A thrown in to keep the pace moving when the movie's steam begin to simmer and wane.The ending -- no need to get into detail here -- is so unfathomably stupid it's pathetic. David ran out of ideas, so he throw in the ending designed to weird out the audience as maximally as possible for a desired effect. If he thought that might work, he's wrong. I don't get the ending because I didn't understand the film as soon as FBI agent characters exit the picture half an hour into the picture. I find the ending ""laughably"" bad in a nonsensical way like an atrociously bad student film with a gleefully dumb ending to end the torment once and for all. Bad-art film fan & fellow ""pretentious filmmaker"" colleague Andy Warhol would find this film a complete garbage that he might recoil in revulsion at if he had to sit through this lame & morbid mess of a film again if he were alive.Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is one of the worst films I've ever seen in term of profound disdain for the audience who ask for clarity (not spelling out, but the plot that's at least comprehensible) in plot. I compliment the director for topping himself with a film as bad if not worse than Dune.Zero stars out of four",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
81,winstonsmith_84,Watch this stoned... (spoilers maybe),7,7 August 2001,"Well, this movie was somewhat of a treat for the film buffs like me.  I never really liked David Lynch, or Twin Peaks, until I saw this!  The movie is definetly odd, but compelling and visually stimulating.  The odd characters and 'small/odd U.S. town' feel was really captured in an intense and comical way.The scenes in the 'mind' or 'hell' or whatever that place was were just excellent... it is as if Laura Paulmer's killer may not really exist in the physical form, or on Earth at all.  Does a demon take the body of her father to commit these assaults on her?  Or is she just taking too many drugs?  I don't know, probably never will... I've watched this movie twice and still don't quite get it, but everytime I watch it I pick up new things and study it.I reccomend to smoke a joint before watching this, as you might just be able to take in the movie better.  It is probably tough for the average viewer to watch, and you'll be looking at the clock.  But just sit through this movie, have some weed, and just watch it.  Don't expect to understand it.  Just watch it and enjoy!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
82,CinefanR,The circle of mystery,10,29 June 2012,"There are many interpretations to this movie. The first time I saw ""Fire, Walk With Me"", I didn't remember much from the series, so the movie didn't make any sense whatsoever. It seemed exceedingly self-indulgent and completely gratuitous in its violence, condescending, weird just for the sake of being weird. There was no ""punch line"", no explanation. I didn't realize the movie was both a prequel AND a sequel to the series, and in fact everything makes sense, except a few details, which Lynch was going to elaborate on in further films. Unfortunately, due to the poor response, that didn't happen. There is powerful imagery here, and Lynch has this unique ability (I'm referring strictly to the Twin Peaks franchise) to be incredibly disturbing on a visceral level without resorting to cheap shocks. I don't know how he does it. Some scenes are harrowing, with a genuine feel of terror and desperation. The whole experience is eerie and frightening, sometimes funny, especially in the first half, which has a different tone. The only problem is with Lara Flynn Boyle's replacement- it's awkward and difficult to accept another actress playing the same role. The film can be discussed forever (isn't that a hallmark of good cinema?), just watch it after you've seen the series.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

84,ragpap93,Poor Prequel to Twin Peaks but things finally make sense,4,14 May 2018,"The first half hour was kind of interesting. Teresa Palmer, Bob's first murder victim as mentioned in the series is shown here before showing the last week of Laura Palmer. The really ugly side of Laura Palmer as hinted in the series is so in your face here. Obviously there is no suspense and the movie only makes sense if you watched the series. Personally I am not a fan of Twin Peaks but the show had a charm like that of a small town and the friendly, quirky characters in it. However because of this charm in the series or the lack of it in the movie I am sure a lot of people would prefer the series. The movie is R-rated and rightly so as we see how Laura Palmer was exploited by Bob, Leland Palmer (her dad) and some strangers at the creepy, dodgy night club but she is really not all that innocent. She has some issues like cocaine addiction. Cannot hold that against her as addiction is a disease. So anyway everything is just loud and annoying with a lot of screaming. You would not get scared only mildly irritated.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
85,Dandy_Desmond,Meet Laura Palmer....,10,12 September 2010,"First of all those thinking about seeing their first Lynch film or checking out the whole Twin Peaks world this is probably not the film to start. This is simply a delicious treat for people who have followed the show and finally get a chance to meet Laura Palmer and see her last week on earth. After taking in the whole series, I was approaching the film with a little anxiety as throughout the show due to the constant stories and visual reminders of Laura Palmer I had build an idea of what she would be like in my mind, I was hoping I would not be disappointed. However what I have found since discovering David Lynch and his work, he has rarely disappointed. Sheryl Lee gives a brave and full on performance as the beautiful, lonely and disturbed Laura Palmer. She gives an outstanding performance of a girl on the edge, losing her grip on reality and pushing those who love her away and herself towards a path of destruction. Fans of Lynch will know all his trademarks are here. Its sensual, erotic, violent, weird, scary, unsettling, humorous and although answers some questions lingering from the show, brings up new ones. The inventive use of image and sound to set an unsettling tone which most directors don't know how to do now. It has scenes that stick in the mind - for instance a beautiful and sad moment as Laura walks into a club to meet some men who are going to pay her for sex and as a sad song is being sung and she breaks down crying and the extended scene in the sex club, with the almost hypnotic music pounding away and the use of subtitles as we can't really here what the actors are saying.When the movie finished it made me want to go and watch the series all over again! Thank you David Lynch and Sheryl Lee this is what I was hoping to see.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
86,evilmatt-3,"Thoughtful, engaging, scary",9,31 May 2003,"Lynch is really good at what he does.  Although most don't consider FWWM to be his best film, I'd argue that it's definitely up there, surpassing _Blue Velvet_ and possibly _Eraserhead_ (this latter being probably the only movie that beats this one in terms of obscurity).This film is probably the most rewarding one I've seen from Lynch.  His typical M.O. is to obsessively circle on one idea for an entire film.  While this works very well sometimes (_Eraserhead_, _Mullholland Drive_), it and also lead to dead ends (_Blue Velvet_).  However, this is NOT the case with _Twin Peaks_.  In fact, there are so many ideas and levels here that the whole experience is almost intimidating, leading many to denounce it as incomprehensible garbage.  This is unfair.  FWWM *does* have a story, firmly rooted characters, and so much emotional intelligence it should embarrass anyone connected with mainstream Hollywood film.I saw this movie before the TV series, and so my judgment is somewhat shaped by that.  Know that this is much darker territory than what we see on TV; however, that's also a theme addressed by the film that has gone unnoticed by virtually all the critics.  The first half (with the autopsy of Teresa Banks) is cute and lighthearted, because the ugliness (a murder) has already happened.  When you're on the other side of a murder (Laura's story) things are understandably much nastier.Terrific.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
87,eddiez61,"As Weird & Wonderful as Twin Peaks was, This Is Even More So",8,25 September 2011,"On the fractured landscape of TV fiction, in terms of pure creativity and shear audacity, David Lynch's Twin Peaks is the towering summit (summits?!). For us rabid fans Twin Peaks reigns as the most original, most compelling, most memorable television series ever broadcast. Lynch's creations are often unclassifiable, never confined to a single genre, but Twin Peaks, more so than not, is a mystery thriller that also abounds with outrageous humor. The comedy normally arose from his deft handling of the intensely melodramatic atmosphere which he often interrupts with moments of unparalleled bizarreness. David exacerbates scenes of heightened sentimentality with audaciously maudlin music, nudging it into the realm of farce or parody. These tactics often illicit from the viewer a nervous chuckle that then grows into full throated guffaws as the scene plays out to increasingly demented proportions. The program ended abruptly after only its second season, and as it never truly revealed the mystery of Laura Palmer's murder there were substantial questions lurking in the minds of its disappointed viewers. The film set out to answer many of those questions and also manages to raise a few new ones, just to keep things interesting. Fire Walk With Me certainly isn't Lynch's finest film, and it really doesn't have to be because it only needed to conclude what the TV series had initiated. Freed from the confines of broadcast TV's censorship the film more confidently employs morally challenging, shocking elements. Nudity and profanity are effectively exploited to instill a more palpable, more visceral anxiety. Laura's sordid home life, which was only suggested in the series, is here fully revealed in all of its Freudian horror. The series leisurely developed its quirky rhythm by relying on its recurring hour long format for its unusual pacing, often taking three or four episodes to reveal a plot line. It was almost random in it's approach to narrative, jumping from one character to the next as the story veered and strayed. The film, however, is a much more focused character study with nearly every scene centered on Laura Palmer, with a single arching story line, progressively escalating in dramatic intensity. Fire Walk With Me very nearly succeeds as a fully independent film that is not entirely dependent on our familiarity with its particulars, yet it does derive much of its impact by how masterfully it takes advantage of our prior knowledge of the heroine's demise. Many films are built around the conceit that its destination is no secret, and a gifted storyteller makes that ride worthwhile. Lynch makes it thrilling. And hypnotic, and gorgeous, and entirely unique. There's no one even close to him for exploiting an audience's willingness to suspend disbelief, elegantly balancing an impossibly absurd combination of outlandish fantasy and soul gripping realism. His stunning visuals are matched by his irresistibly compelling audioscapes. Importantly, he is diligent to keep us acutely aware that what we're experiencing is in fact a contrived, fabricated illusion, which is exactly what a true artist aught to do - acknowledge the artifice of his (her) creation while dazzling us with superb technique. David understands intimately the magical & unspeakable role that cinema plays in the human psyche, and he tailors his art to our deepest desires, fears, and mysteries. It doesn't always make sense or obey common rules of logic but it is always thoroughly captivating. So even if you're baffled by the oblique plot and convoluted structure you can still be helplessly entranced by the macabre parade of lurid paranoia that marches across the screen. David Lynch's images and sounds are the best in the business.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
88,Tug-3,A brilliant beginning--and end--to the visionary TV series,8,24 March 2000,"I had the unique opportunity to introduce a friend to the eerie wonders of ""Twin Peaks,"" and did so by first showing her this movie (she was befuddled, of course), then watching the entire run of episodes (over the course of five months' worth of lazy Sunday afternoons), then watching this movie again.  She was amazed, as I was when I first saw _Fire Walk With Me,_ at the intricacy and ingenuity of the Escher-esque story loop David Lynch created.While many fans were disappointed with this film because it did not ""end"" the series in a conventional manner, by having Cooper escape and redeem Laura or something more ""Hollywood,"" _Fire Walk With Me_ does bring the Twin Peaks saga to a horrifying finish.  The very last scene of the film, the haunting tableau of Laura choking on her own laughter and tears while a benign Cooper smiles on, leads us to the dreadful conclusion that both souls are trapped forever in the otherworldly manifestation of the evil that infests Twin Peaks.It is disappointing, to be sure, that so many beloved and quirky characters from the weekly drama had to be cut for this film to achieve a standard running time.  But it is also more true-to-life to show the greater portion of the action from Laura's point of view, intersecting with people a student/closet prostitute would encounter in her last week on earth.  The editor and Lynch showed admirable restraint by not wandering off into tangents that could be stigmatized as being ""weird for weirdness' sake."" 
So many scenes of this film are brilliant.  Until Phillip Jeffries enters Gordon's FBI office, we nearly forget the occult  underbelly that made the TV series so intriguing.  But when he enters, Lynch opens the flood gate; in one instant we are reintroduced to the bizarre sideshow of Black Lodge inhabitants, accompanied by trademark Badalamenti jazz.  This jarring image manages to be both surreal and moving, refamiliarizing us with that netherworld while portending the events to come.  Ronette Pulaski's first appearance is also stunning: she somehow fades _into_ the movie, giving life to a character of whom we knew so little in the TV series, and again recalling what horrible events will transpire.If you have the time, you really ought to do what I did: view all the installments of this truly epic creation, with this film sandwiching the TV series' beginning and end.  If you do you will enjoy the most cohesive and ambitious story loop ever committed to film.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
89,BatBanks,This movie should not never been made,3,19 September 2013,"This is the prequel to David Lynch cult weird TV series. It follows the murder victim Laura Palmer last few days. The movie is weird, disturbing, and make no sense. The whole movie has pointless storyline of Laura Palmer last days. We see her as tormented, sexual abused teenager girl who is terrorizing by a large Indian man named Bob: She's a secret drug user and a hooker at night; Laira seems crazy as well. The movie setting mix with the 50s and 90s clothes and hair. The only good part is at the beginning of the film with the two FBI Investigation (Chris Isaak and Kiefer Suterland) Ray Wise was believable as Laura's father (and later her killer). I think you should skip this movie because most of David Lynch movies are weird (expect The Elephant Man) and stupid.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
90,jhs39,What was he thinking?,5,3 June 2003,"It's really hard to figure out exactly what David Lynch thought he was doing with this pointless and grim prequel to the excellent cult television program.  The idea of doing a movie with the Twin Peaks characters was a great one, but a prequel following the last days of Laura Palmer?  What new could the movie reveal that wasn't already dealt with in detail in the show? As it turns out nothing but some mild nudity.  Fans of the television show already know how Laura was killed, by whom, why and about the sordid activities she was involved in.  The movie doesn't offer anything new that sheds further light on her last days and non-fans will likely be completely lost since the movie makes no attempt at all to function as a stand-alone film.  The movie assumes that the viewer already knows about Bob, since no explanation is provided.  Likewise having the one-armed man as a character makes perfect sense unless you haven't seen the television show, in which case you're not going to have any idea who he is or what he's doing in the movie.  Other characters turn up for unnecessary cameos even though they have little to do with Laura Palmer's story including the Log Lady, Madchen Amick's waitress Shelly and her abusive boyfriend Leo and, in the most head scratching choice, a bloodied Heather Graham as her character Annie in a nightmare sequence, an odd choice since Annie didn't turn up until late in the second season, long after Laura was dead and the show had moved on to different plotlines.  It's hard to really come up with much positive to say about this depressing mess of a movie, but there is a certain pleasure in seeing the Twin Peaks characters again, even in a lousy movie like this. Sheryl Lee shows herself to be a much better actress than I would have guessed based on her Twin Peaks appearances as Laura's cousin and her undistinguished film career to date.  Moira Kelly is also a big improvement over Laura Flynn Boyle as Donna, for whatever that's worth, and she even has a brief topless scene during an orgy.  But even die hard fans of the television show are likely to find Fire Walk With Me unsatisfying. Hopefully David Lynch will someday do something else with these characters. With the good Agent Cooper trapped in the lodge and a bad Agent Cooper running around loose, there has to be a good movie in there somewhere. Maybe next time David Lynch will get it right.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
91,realalexrice,"Horrifying, somehow a sequel of a prequel (if you know what I mean)",10,8 June 2021,"Sheryl Lee kinda be like, yeah lemme ruin your day with this one of a kind performance that is so uniquely capitalizing on expanding upon the linchpin of one the greatest tv shows ever and simultaneously making an insanely masterful film that discusses the themes of a continuous cycle of incest, abuse, rape, violence, miscommunication, and so many other elements. David Lynch crafts an undeniable peak (one of many) in his career with this film as he adds to his amazing brainchild, Twin Peaks, with more layers that have only aged amazingly well given the contextualization of 2017's The Return. These layers continue to unfurl themself with each viewing I have of Twin Peaks universe media and I think it speaks to a true grasp on the surreal, funny, devastating, and horrifying word that Lynch really seemingly has on his own creation. To Fire Walk With Me's credit, it's a film that makes me cry multiple times from just how dark Lynch goes to get his point across. In reading older reviews of the film, it seems by the time the operatically violent finale happens, most critics had checked out of this which is a massive mistake. The final day of Laura Palmer and the night leading into it is potentially the most disturbing sequence of events in a film filled with many other horrifying moments. Leland Palmer's struggle to love his daughter and internal fight with Bob who wants Laura is so well juxtaposed with Laura having finally having confirmed who it had been coming in through her window all these years (in the scene that kicks her spiraling into her final day). The eventual murder is, unlike much of Lynch's violence, extremely hidden but explicit in audio. The overcrowding nature from the score attempts (and succeeds) at putting you in Laura's mind for these final moments of her life. She is so terrified, knowing who Bob is, who her father really is, and seeing her reflection showing her what Bob wants: her. And then, Ronette literally gets an angel and her ropes are suddenly lose for Mike to toss the ring in towards Laura. It's a moment so insane but so devastating because of how it dooms but still helps Laura in the only way possible at this point, she will die or be taken by Bob. And sadly we know how it turns out. Thankfully though in the Lodge, she seems to be comforted by Coop and an angel so if this had been the last entry in the Twin Peaks universe, at least it is knowing Laura was able to achieve some peace. It's an unexplainable and bizarrely cathartic film by the time the credits have rolled and I find it to be Lynch's best work because of how drawn to the character of Laura Palmer he was to make such a personal (and risky, but also entirely Lynch) movie as this about such an integral part to a beloved series. Not only that, but I find the performances to be haunting and the best of many of these actor's careers, Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise especially.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

95,sashamyshkina,I watched this to try and find answers to my questions but it just left me with even more questions.,10,21 May 2021,"This movie is both fundamentally Twin Peaks and an almost antithesis to Twin Peaks, at the same time as being a masterpiece as a standalone movie. And it blew my mind.I am a die-hard fan of Twin Peaks to the point that I think it might be the only thing I'm capable of talking about. And of course, after the incomprehensible masterpiece that was the third season, I kept hearing that watching Fire Walk With Me would help me understand. And one some levels it did, but on others it was just as weird and bizarre as I could have expected from a Twin Peaks prequel.It took a deep dive into the side of Laura Palmer we never quite saw during the original series, and amongst all of its classic weirdness, turned out to be a disturbingly tragic character study of a teenage girl who knew that death was inevitable. It shows the horrible nightmarish reality of happened on the last night of Laura's life, as well as all of the fateful events with Teresa Banks that led up to it as well as delving deeper into the mythology of the Black Lodge, a place that, to this day, haunts me with its strange beauty as well as being one of my worst nightmares.This movie is different to the original TV show, and the reason it was dragged by critics was that everyone who saw it was expecting it to be the same. But as I've learned from watching The Return in Season 3, you never really get the same thing twice from Lynch. Fire Walk With Me is the dark, human side of Twin Peaks - it shows just what happened and spares no ounce of horrific detail. It's deeply emotional and deeply human, whilst still retaining the signature mystery of that small town in northern Washington. The ending was tragically beautiful, and I broke down sobbing so hard after finishing it.I'm quite adamant over people trying to ""eXpLaIn ThE MeAnInG oF tWiN pEaKs (NO, ACTUALLY!!!)"" in four-hour-long videos. It just annoys me when something that is clearly not meant to be analysed is analysed. I mean, I'm not saying that there isn't a plot at all and you should take it at face level, because it is indeed a beautifully interwoven story which deserved thought, I'm more referring to the fact that a lot of people get too bogged down into trying to meticulously piece everything together that they completely forget the other aspects of the film. I mean, I've got to admit that even I sometimes have to google ""Plot of Twin Peaks"", but I usually never go further than that. This applies to pretty much every David Lynch film. I think that a lot of people don't realise that Lynch is unlike most other directors, and that his movies are less about having a coherent plot and more about the surreal and bizarre world they suck you into. And, besides, David Lynch never confirms nor denies any theories for interpreting his movies, so what's the point?However, the thing with Fire Walk With Me is that, even though being just as bizarre as the rest of the Twin Peaks universe, it makes a strange amount of sense and bridges the gap between Seasons 1 & 2 and Season 3 really nicely. Throughout the entirety of this and Missing Pieces I kept exclaiming ""Ohhhhhh!!' as I realised the way that everything links back to everything else was made weirdly clear. The one problem I had whilst watching this was the casting. As delighted as I was to see most of the original cast back, as good of a job as Moira Kelly did she didn't match the character of Donna as well as Lara Flynn Boyle did. Additionally, David Bowie, Kyle MacLachlan, Kiefer Sutherland and Chris Isaak deserved way more screen time. I think the scene with the CCTV camera in the hallway when Phillip Jeffries reappears, only for his recounting to turn into inter-dimensional chaos, has got to be the highlight of the movie. Also, Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer were unfortunately absent too. Audrey and Ben Horne were two of the most interesting characters from the original series and I would have loved to see some sort of storyline with them (maybe something about One Eyed Jack's?).One thing I should say: my recommended viewing order would be Twin Peaks season 1 and 2, then Fire Walk With Me and The Missing Pieces (I watched them back-to-back in one sitting!) and only then watch the third season. Don't make the same mistake as I did, believe me, everything will become much clearer.Don't listen to the critics. Listen to the tiny voice in your brain that screams ""What the ****? I need more information!"" when you're watching Twin Peaks. And then watch this to get that information and let that tiny voice go crazy.-Sasha.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
96,varun_120,Stupidity at its best,1,15 April 2012,"Recently I did two mistakes. I saw Mulholland drive and then I did a bigger one to watch, Twin Peaks- Fire walk with me. To some extent, I found Mulholland Drive understandable, but this film was totally incomprehensible.The movie starts with two detectives coming to a weird town investigating a murder case of a girl. Then out of a sudden one of them disappears.Then there is no mention of the other detective throughout the film. Neither the David Lynch bothers to tell this. Then story is turned towards Laura Palmer, a troubled teenage girl. And she is somehow connected to the prior murder case,. I don't want discuss the further story, because it is rubbish.Some people watch David Lynch's films, two times or even more than two times. But, we view films simply to be entertained not to get bored. As always, there are some stupid character blurting out some stupid dialogues, ludicrous situations, overacting and especially NO SCRIPT. Again there are some loose scenes put together and called a film.I didn't understand the film at all,in the midway I got so bored that I even didn't care, and was waiting for the film to be over. Some 'This may contain spoilers' reviews said, you have to see the Twin Peaks series before you watch the films. They should have put up a board saying such thing.Some people say you need to be intelligent to understand Lynch's films. I saw 'Inceptions' once understood it completely. (Pretentious)People digging Lynch's work will like this film and normal sane people like me won't like this film. Whether intelligent or not a film should entertain you, and this film fails to do so. There are some usual weird characters in this flick (as they were in Mulholland Drive). The story seemed so good in the first fifteen minutes, but when the detectives disappeared and no evidence was given about where they went, I lost my interest and further story which made no sense whatsoever, added to my frustration. I might understand this film if I see it one or two times more, but I'm lethargic to do so.

The film as a whole really didn't make much of any sense and it's not very understandable if you haven't seen all of twin peaks beforehand, making it pretty unlikable and not a good standalone film. There were some really weird parts, which were enjoyable, but many others that seemed to be weird for the sake of being weird.I did love Sheryl Lee in this.

But then again I didn't fully *understand*. People who watch this should not *expect* and should simply *enjoy*. I'm not going to go into any story of plot because I don't have time, but I don't really need to because if you are looking to watch this you are familiar with the TV series- and that's enough.

Once again I emphasize- don't *look* for answers.. it's like looking for answers in a Stephen King book and reading another one to find those answers. Nothing is specifically *revealed*, but there are direct associations if your brain has the recollection and the understanding to put things together. Twin Peaks is a lateral film. it is not 'straight forward' and should be observed cryptically. As for the dark and disturbing side of things, yes it is exactly that, but I would not run away from it for that reason. I've seen reviews stating that the violence shocks. I'd disagree. What actually shocks us is SPOILER the nature of evil that motivates a father to rape his own daughter and the effect that has on her personality. There is nudity in the 'bang bang' bar, but I find none of this nudity remotely sexy or sensual, it is like descending into a nightmare when you consider that is the alter self that Laura created. Damaged goods looking to score for drugs.. perhaps an inner rebellion of the severed tie of father and daughter by the unspeakable. Anyway, you get the idea.

It arrived about a year after normal people had stopped caring about Twin Peaks, a time when even fans of the show were starting to forget certain plot and character details.Fire Walk With Me was like the Vanilla Ice movie: appearing, embarrassingly, five minutes after the pop-culture phenomenon was over. (The TV show itself had alienated a lot of diehards with its shocking decline in quality midway through the second season. It rebounded in its last few episodes, but by then, it was too late.)It was booed at film festivals and then ridiculed by the critics. It was one of those movies that comes out every year or two, like Showgirls or Suburbicon, that every critic tries to tee off on, using lame one-liners they've been saving up, like ""This isn't the worst movie ever made; it only feels that way.""And it bombed spectacularly at the box office. Actors like Lara Flynn Boyle, Michael Ontkean, and (apart from reluctantly appearing in some cameos) Kyle MacLachlan had opted out of participating either in disgust or because they had sensed that this would be a career-killer. In my local paper's year-end 10-worst list, Fire Walk With Me was #1.Sometimes everybody gets it wrong.30 years down the road, nobody talks about Scent of a Woman, Enchanted April, The Crying Game or most of the other respectable movies of 1992, while Fire Walk With Me is in the Criterion Collection. It's one of those rare adventurous classics (Vertigo and Starship Troopers come to mind) that's too brilliant to be destroyed by smirking middlebrow critics and lazy audiences.I don't think it's possible to make a movie about incest that's honest and ""classy."" Horror is the most appropriate film genre for a story about child sexual abuse... and horror is the least dignified genre (in spite of the fact that the best horror movies, from Nosferatu to Halloween to Hereditary, tend to live forever, gaining in reputation every year).The two perfect movies about The Thing We Don't Like To Talk About are Fire Walk With Me and the microbudget grindhouse classic The Witch Who Came From the Sea. Both movies are grimy, ultraviolent, sexually explicit but uncomfortable and totally unerotic: they feel like movies you shouldn't be watching. When I saw The Witch Who Came From the Sea for the first time (at a repertory theater near my college), tons of people walked out.But while The Witch Who Came From the Sea is almost a ""naive"" movie (fearless, punishing, anti-commercial storytelling from people who barely seem to understand that they're breaking the rules, who haven't completely mastered the conventions of cinema), Fire Walk With Me is peak David Lynch: a movie made by a director who began his career as a painter.It's jewel-like in a way, from its unique sound design and hypnotic and sinister score to its production design, its fever-nightmare editing, and in the unusual way it locks the viewer into its doomed heroine's point of view.As someone who grew up in a house that was dominated by mental illness (and in an extended family with a history of sexual abuse), I can tell you that Fire Walk With Me captures some things that no other movie or book does (though The Shining gets close): the feeling of being afraid at/of home, the disorienting feeling of praying that you'll be rescued by the very person who is tormenting you. It captures sensations that only a few people get to experience (child abuse victims, wartime soldiers, and torture victims among them): that the entire world is upside-down, that everything is a lie, that you're sharing an amoral and frightening universe with people who are nevertheless acting as if everything is orderly and decent. Fire Walk With Me captures the split between the shameful night-time world of abuse and the day-time world in which the victim becomes an accomplice, helping an entire family maintain its cover story. This movie forces you to experience the schoolday drowsiness following a night of abuse, fear, drugs and bad dreams.People who haven't watched every episode of the (tonally quite different) TV show are likely to be bewildered by the plot of Fire Walk With Me... and most fans of that show probably have no interest in spending two hours in FWWM's hallucinatory hellworld. It's hard to say who exactly was supposed to be buying tickets to this movie, or recommending it to friends. It belongs on a short list of the worst date movies of all time.I'll say, though, that Fire Walk has always scared the hell out of me, has always entranced me, and has moved me to tears a few times. (Two particularly disturbing images, one of a girl falling through space, on fire, abandoned by the angels, and another of an angel disappearing from a painting, abandoning a child in the painting to some unknown fate, are paid off in the movie's unforgettable final shots.) Even for Lynch, Fire Walk With Me is difficult and unconventional. (Of Lynch's more expensive movies, this is the closest to Eraserhead.) It's a grueling, mild-altering two-hour free-fall to the bottom of a well.For all of these reasons, most people will find Fire Walk With Me to be an unwatchable or laughably bad movie, and for these reasons I consider it the best.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
101,cornflakeboy20,Questions in a world of blue,7,23 March 2004,"So I once heard a crazy guy at a cafe discussing heart of darkness and saying, ""I understand the term murderer, but I don't understand the term victim."" Besides absolutely freaking me out, the guy - years after the fact - gave me something to chew on in pondering TPFWWM. The ostensible plot (with many Lynchian diversions, often inscrutable) concerns the evolution of Laura Palmer as both victim and villain (David Foster Wallace wrote a great essay on this character in, A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again) and Ray Wise as both Daddy and killer. These are the interesting points of the film, and where it remains most linear. Then we have the diversions...plot threads (big ones) that lead absolutely nowhere. If you like David and you're willing to go along for the ride, it's all good, if you don't know what you're in for, well I guess you deserve what you get...On another note, I hear on the DVD documentary that there were four hours of scenes shot, where are they? You know, you get good features on big blockbuster movies of scenes that ought to have been cut, but with unsuccessful movies, we never get good extras that show us what the film could have been in a different editing incarnation.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
102,Bowserb46,It may be art...but I don't see it!,3,3 June 2011,"I only recently saw the entire TP series, when it came to Netflix. Previously I think I had seen part of the pilot. I watched all 30 episodes over about five days, and I can see why it has a dedicated following...and also why it was canceled. Now I've seen the movie, and I can't begin to express my disappointment.I had hoped for a movie that captured the best of the TV series, but what I got was another David Lynch film. Indeed, I couldn't sit through the whole thing at one time. I only watched it through to the end to be sure I was being fair, and in the end, the best part was putting it into the mail back to Netflix.This movie was to me at once disturbing and tedious. It was like the worst of the TV episodes plus typical David Lynch ""let me see how much I can get away with without getting an X rating"" material. That's kind of a shame. Tempered by broadcast FCC rules, it seems Lynch can turn out pretty good work. Turned loose with a movie, he generates trash.Just one opinion.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
103,jdjc001,Not quite what I was hoping for....,4,7 November 2020,"A couple of months ago, I watched the Twin Peaks series in full for the first time and, for the most part, enjoyed it. It was charming yet mysterious, and for a while it kept your eyes glued to the screen. Sadly, after Laura's killer was revealed, it went completely off the tracks and even the acclaimed ending of the second season deeply disappointed and bewildered me, but I was willing to chalk it up to the fact that David Lynch was attempting to undo the damage made during his absence. With all that in mind, I had high hopes for this film, as Lynch would once again be able to take control of his story and provide a new insight into the chilling story of Laura Palmer. Unfortunately, it really missed the mark for me.10 minutes into the movie, I was already feeling deeply disappointed. The Teresa Banks story is clearly very unfinished and holds no bearing to the grand scheme of the film. Further still, Chris Isaak is no Kyle MacLachlan, but even MacLachlan's parts seemed largely pointless, and I have no idea what the hell that David Bowie cameo was for. Granted, these are things that I believe are discussed in The Return, however at the time it would've been totally baffling. Furthermore, I'm sure people would've felt ripped off in these first 10 minutes as I did considering the film is supposed to be chronicling the final days of Laura Palmer as advertised. Nevertheless, the problems don't end there.The Laura Palmer story, while made engaging by Sheryl Lee, is simply a live-action retelling of almost everything we already know from the series. I don't have a big problem with this per se, but I was really hoping for more of a new insight into her story. This does come in the form of the scenes with Leland/BOB which are all very good, however time which should've been spent there was instead wasted with Bobby, James and Donna. Don't get me wrong, they are all important characters when discussing Laura's story, but having Donna attend One Eyed Jack's and having Bobby kill someone were pointless and (especially in the case of Bobby) nonsensical additions. Having James around was also pointless because despite allegedly caring about her so much he does absolutely nothing to try and stop her from running away.On top of all this, there's the lacklustre Black Lodge stuff. I'm perfectly fine with absurdity (I really love how it's done in Mulholland Drive) but here it just feels really forced with the weird costumes and random dialogue. It would be better if we were at least given some context, but instead it's just kind of...there. I understand once again that this kind of content is discussed further in The Return but as a stand alone film it feels like it was something that either should've been expanded upon or simply scrapped. I can certainly see why audiences at the time felt bewildered.Overall, while the movie did have some redeeming qualities, I can't help but feel like it just fell flat on its face. I think the fact that Lynch made this movie because 'he couldn't leave the world of Twin Peaks' is quite telling as this movie is clearly made primarily for him and his most die-hard fans who think everything he does is the deepest artwork ever created. Perhaps I'd have to see The Return to fully appreciate parts of this, but even without the Black Lodge/lore stuff this movie still undeniably has a lot of flaws in my opinion.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
104,leon-smoothy,"Dreamlike, surreal horror of the best kind...",10,20 February 2015,"For those even loosely familiar with Twin Peaks, old and new fans alike, this is a must see. There is debate over which you should see first; this ""prequel"" or the series (30 episodes). Either way, this has to be seen to get a grip on the Twin Peaks universe, and this film was made to clarify a lot of events and situations which there was not given time to do in the TV-series. It's rumored the network company stressed the storytelling in the show to reveal Laura Palmer's murderer earlier than Lynch and Frost intended to, due to dwindling viewer numbers, and that the series was intended to run for a longer time.For Lynch fans, this film is pure gold - I think it's probably his best film to date. There is a lot of details in the film, and it can seem slight slow-paced, but it's for a reason, Lynch does not rush things. As usual, there is a lot of riddles, surreal dream-like sequences and quirky, dark characters, all with secrets to hide. Few films I've ever seen has had the kind of dark, brooding, unsettling mood seen here, combined with strange surreal backwards sound effects and an rumbling sound-scape which creates real fear.It's not easy to understand, but that's the beauty of it, it will require several viewings to get all the symbolism and the different characters intentions. There is a real sense here that you're not really supposed to get it all, there are things we can't comprehend, that takes place in dimensions outside our reach. When our dimensions clash, it shows the helplessness of human beings, that often we are at mercy of powers that intends to destroy and corrupt us.And Lynch's way of putting those dark beings in a kind of ordinary, but severely twisted kind of locations just beyond our normal daily life is horrifying. Few films has actually frightened me like this one, on a far worse level than most other good horror movies.But there is also great beauty in it, a great sad/sentimental soundtrack which take on almost hypnotic, pulsating forms as when Laura and her friends visit the Bang Bang Bar.So, for all Lynch fans, see it, and for others, give it a chance!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
105,symbioticpsychotic,!kcoR s'teL,8,1 October 2005,"There's no doubt about it, Twin Peaks changed the living, breathing face and body of television, the soul and minds of those who watched it, and the attitudes of film and television makers everywhere, who watched what was intended to be a 2 hour Tele-movie become a phenomenon. A phenomenon that dissected the way television was made and shown to its very core, and reassembled it in a fashion that no one had ever witnessed, or dreamed of. A phenomenon that would sweep the world Not since JR was shot in Dallas had the entire worldwide viewing public stopped to ask itself a question, for one brief, shining, crystallized moment, in 1990 Who Killed Laura Palmer? And so, with David Lynch's Fire Walk With Me, the question is not Who? But rather, Why? This film precedes the TV show, these are the last 7 days of Laura Palmer, and after watching this film, it is pretty apparent why Laura wanted to die, she lived in a world out of her grasp and control, she was desperately fighting what she was becoming, but realized that the forces that were pulling her down, were too strong for her to fight against I knew someone like that once, and to be quite honest, it has changed the way I look at Laura Palmer. The first time I watched this film was in 1992 when it came out on VHS, I was 16 or 17 and I hated it. It wasn't Twin Peaks. It was horrible and violent and had none of the cuteness and quirkiness and lovable characters of the TV show, and I never watched it again. Watching it almost 15 years on, as an adult, I understand why I hated it so much when I was a kid. As a 16-17 year male, I had absolutely no concept or understanding of what it would be like to be Laura Palmer, completely unable to relate to her, and therefore completely unable to understand or sympathize. Completely unable to understand what it would mean to live in a world where everyone is in love with you, and how that would only make you hate yourself more, when you hate yourself so much already.This is a really sad movie. It really puts you in to Laura Palmer's world, or what's left of it, briefly. Maybe too brief, but, you know, maybe I read too much in to films, or I get too close too them, but this film has changed Twin Peaks for me forever. And it's quite possible that it will do the same for you. Even though she was dead before the opening credits, I never realized until watching this film again that Laura was never freed, she was always in 'purgatory' if you will, always in the Red Room when we saw her, or seeing a flashback of her murder during the course of the TV show. Fire Walk With Me gives something to Laura Palmer that she had been denied on television.Release.For the most part, this film was not made for the fans, nor was it made for the money, Lynch made this film for Laura palmer. His love of her is what inspired him to breathe life into her character on the big screen, after taking it away on the small. This is his dance, first and final, with Laura Palmer. It is not ours to be involved with, it is ours only to watch the romance between character and director evolve and be burnt too soon. It is ours only to witness, not too understand or judge, not to ask or question.From the opening shot, a television with no reception, which is quickly obliterated by an Axe, it is quite clear that this ain't no TV show, and if the symbolism of the TV being smashed isn't enough to tell you that, then the opening scene will. This is the part of Twin Peaks that simply never would have made it to TV. The real Twin Peaks, if you will, the dark, tortured, seedy underbelly of a town with too few people, and too many secrets, the sort of place that exists almost everywhere in the world (with the exception of Cicely, Alaska).",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
106,KnightLander,"Strictly for Lynch devotees; anyone else, steer clear",7,20 June 2005,"I had heard much about the cult television series ""Twin Peaks"", and decided to buy the First Season on DVD. When I found that none of the stores near me had it in stock, I decided to pick up the movie instead. In some ways, this was good. In some, it was bad. Let me explain ...In 1991, ""Twin Peaks"" was canceled. Immediately popular director David Lynch, who also created and wrote most of the show, said that he wasn't finished with the show yet ... and set to work making a movie that would close off the ""Twin Peaks"" phenomenon. ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" - this film - is the result, a 135 minute journey into a realm where insanity and madness reign supreme.""Fire Walk With Me"" is a prequel to ""Twin Peaks"". The first thirty minutes deal with two FBI agents, Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland), who are investigating the murder of a young girl in the small town of Twin Peaks. Just when Desmond seems to have a suspect, we fade out and find that we are months later. From there, the film follows the events leading up to the mysterious death of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), which the series focused on. Kyle MacLachlan has some screen time as the series' main character, Dale Cooper.This is probably the hardest film to review in the world. First of all, let me say that if you aren't a fan of ""Twin Peaks"" or of David Lynch, you will be lost shortly after the film begins. This movie was created solely for ""Twin Peaks"" lovers, and if you haven't seen the show, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer is unveiled in this movie.If ever there has been a movie that is pure insanity, it is this. ""Fire Walk With Me"" is one-hundred percent madness. And yet, throughout the whole film, I was completely mesmerized. And when the movie ended, I couldn't speak or do anything for about an hour. This movie truly has an effect on you, whether you're a fan of the show or not.The cast is terrific, but it's David Lynch and Angelo Baladamenti who steal the show. Lynch is either a madman or a genius - I can't decide between the two. But Baladamenti is certainly a master composer, because his score for this film is beautiful.Seeing is believing. That fits perfectly from this film. Perhaps after I watch the show, I will better understand this film. Until then, I can just say that it the most indescribable, frightening, mesmerizing, and astonishing film I've ever seen.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

108,vaultoverseer_15,One of my personal favourites,10,7 May 2021,"This is a TV movie that got critically panned when it came out. It shouldn't be good, yet even a masterpiece. But Fire Walk with Me in my opinion is one of the greatest films of all time, and my second favourite film.In retrospect, it's easy to see why this movie got panned. It's a movie much more adult than the show, and has very little humour or the fun of Twin Peaks. That fantastic cliffhanger is confusingly addressed, and if you dropped off during the low points of the show you will not understand the plot. I still don't understand the absolute hatred, because there are plenty of powerful sequences that I really can't understand someone not feeling anything towards.What's frustrating to me though is that there is a real story taking place even if you strip away the supernatural elements. A young girl has been deeply traumatised by molestation at the hands of her father, leading to a downward spiral into drugs and sex that inevitably leads to her death. The supernatural elements to this heighten the stakes of this. This isn't a depressing movie about a sad situation, this is a tragedy about the coming of evil. Sheryl Lee is beaten physically and emotionally and convincingly creates this battered young teenager. Yet she is seemingly shielding the world from this great evil by allowing herself to be beaten. Despite being a real fleshed fleshed out character, she is also an unrealistically moral person, who seems to be willing to sacrifice herself for evil. And Ray Wise plays a character who both plays a realistic abuser and evil spirit. What's interesting is that in some sense Leland can be interpreted as a real abuser, because he appears to struggle with his acts but never seem to try to stop them.This is a deeply moving picture. The first big scene is the Garmonbozia scene at the convenience store, which is terrifying in the way it explains the fear. Our normally stoic Cooper is nervous, as the tv begins to go static to a picture of the FBI building to the store, almost as though the reality is shifting from light hearted cop show to full on horror. The Pink Room scene is especially notable for its excessive nudity, in which we see our protagonists completely stripped off their humanities by the excesses of Laura's lifestyle. The murder scene is both terrifying and epic - it's both a terrifying demise but also a desperate act for Laura to save herself from becoming BOB. And finally, the final scene is a dramatic release. After two hours of absolute torture, Laura Palmer sees the light and ascends to death. In our brain, we know this is a terrible outcome because she died a terrible life and never got to escape. And yet, she's happy, almost as though she knows she did good, and we get the sense that she did well.So what does it all mean? Well partially to me, this is to say that the death of Laura Palmer is an event so significant in the way it affects everything. Judy is released, we assume because of this. I think this ties into the idea that the whole tragedy of the death of a young woman affects our society, the idea that heinous acts of violence lead to more evil. Rather than embrace the cynical, Lynch wants us to think of the optimism of Laura Palmer. Things may not seem to get better, but they will. Of course there's much more to it than that, and I don't know for sure. But that's the brilliance Lynch and especially this film.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

110,Freedomisanillusion,Moria Kelly was wrong...,6,22 September 2005,"Moria Kelly said in an interview that if you loved the TV show then you would love the prequel. I disagree quite vehemently.I really really like Twin Peaks, the TV series. I'm not one of these fanatics who knows every word Ben Horne uttered in episode 1.3 or anything, but I really enjoy the show.I really enjoy the show, mainly for its quirkiness. It's an oddball, funny and intriguing show, at times terrifying (altogther now: BOB) and often very engrossing. It had a light feel to it: the situations never got so bad that there wasn't time for a light quip or two.FIRE WALK WITH ME fails to capture the same mood as the series, despite having the same characters.Sheryl Lee is very good as Laura, the girl who is so cursed that she can only save herself by dying to escape the clutches of BOB and her abusive father, and she manages to convey Laura so well that we feel every punch she does.The rest of the cast are a let-down. Moira Kelly, while good, just isn't the right replacement for Lara Flynn Boyle. The first half hour, involving Teresa Banks does nothing but delay the movie: it sheds no new light on the situation.And the characters have become caricatures. Bobby is a pain, James is under utilised, as is Donna and Shelly and Norma are barely in it. Jacques is given too big a role and Dale Cooper is a completely different character: sullen and morose as opposed to the screwball Coop we know from the series.When we finally get into the swing of things, the last days of Laura's life are dreadful to watch, because we know how it ends. Her death scene is brutal and disturbing, as is most of what leads up to it.Ray Wise is terrifying as Leleand, Frank Silva less so than in the series, although he still manages to elicit a chill down my spine.It's also quite irritating being back in Twin PEaks and only dealing with the characters we don;t care for. I miss Sheriff Truman, Lucy, Josie, Audrey and Pete. I miss the mystery of the series, and the oddball humour. Instead we have a washed out wasteland of confusing scenes and nightmarish imagery.I would be giving this movie a generous 5, if it weren't for the beautiful scene of, after her death, Laura in the waiting room, as she discovers she's been accepted into the White Lodge and is being guided by the angels. It's still disturbing, seeing as she's dead now, but I found that scene tender and moving.Other than that, it is a disappointment coming to it after such an excellent series.6/10",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
111,slawman,The Blue Rose,8,4 November 1999,"Let me begin by saying I am very biased in my opinion on this film.  I am a rather fervent fan of the TV series that begat it.  I also believe that when David Lynch is in full command of his ambition, his dadaist/surrealist visions are equalled only by Jodorowsky.  This is a case where he was in command.Most of the irrationally harsh criticisms aimed at this prequel claim that the film is poor because it is virtually incomprehensible to anyone who has never seen the series (and also, incidentally to most of those who took the series at face value).  This debate has popped up a few times in recent years for an intriguing variety of films (""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" and ""Naked Lunch"" are the first examples that spring to mind).  Is a film required to appeal to any viewer, regardless of their predispositions to be interested in the subject matter or not?  Would a person to whom the music of Pink Floyd is uninteresting enjoy ""The Wall"" (the film)? 
To my way of thinking, the answer to that question is a resounding no, and thus my bias towards this particular movie.  The film is not without its flaws: overlength being the prime one (I get the feeling while watching it that it should be about fifteen minutes shorter, although I admit I can't say what fifteen minutes could be excised).  That leaves the good stuff to ponder:  A scene in a traffic jam which turns into one of the most unbearably intense moments in modern film (upon first viewing in a theater, the scene felt hours long; I was shocked to discover, later on at home, that the scene runs about three minutes).  The ""Pink Room"" sequence at a seedy Canadian dive, strobes and music pounding away.  The inexplicable foreknowledge of the old woman and her grandson.  Not, of course, overlooking the uniformly fine performances given by the large ensemble cast.  Fans of the television show's mythology will love this film, the uninitiated will probably loathe it, and the average filmgoer will be utterly confused.

David lynch is one of the masters of surreal cinema, & in Fire Walk With Me he takes the viewer into dark territory, the film has a dream like quality, it also has a sinister under layer which i found appealing, its hard to categorise this film, it's part mystery, part horror, it's got a bit of romance & it's also quite funny, it mixes all these aspects & the result is another Lynch masterpiece. I first saw this film when it came out back in 1992 & i knew i witnessed something special, when i revisit the film i always get something new from it.

I am sure you can find something better to do than watch this move. the reason I gave it a 3 and not a 1 was because I recognize many of the actors and actresses.

For example, Laura was supposed to have had sexual relations with three men on the night of her death, and to have been attacked by the bird. In this movie we only see her with one male and she is not attacked by the bird. This movie brings almost nothing new to the plot and just summarizes what we already knew from the TV series, so I expected that it should at least try to be consistent and get the details right. The characters are dull, it drags, it has a low quality B-movie feel, and it's complete with pointless little cameos from other characters from the TV series that don't belong in Laura's story. (The majority of this movie revolves around Laura and Donna exclusively, with minor roles for Bobby, James, and Leland.) It has no suspense, but it does have some nudity and unnecessary grotesqueness. Presumably this poor excuse for a movie was a shameless attempt to cash in on the success of the TV series. I would not recommend it, even to fans of the TV series. And if you haven't seen the TV series you won't understand any of it - something that might not bother Lynch fans!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
118,Mackan-8,Loving it more and more...,10,18 September 1999,"I was 12 when I first saw the series on swedish television in 1990. Never before in my life I had seen something that affected me so much. I recorded the second episode and all the rest. Since then I've seen the series about eight times. In 1992 Lynch made this prequel. It's far more darker than the episodes. Some scenes are still confusing for me, but that only makes it more intriguing. Like ""Lost Highway"" this one is made for your inner, darker feelings. If you really think about what ""Twin Peaks"" and the movie is all about, you'll realize that it's more scarier than any ""X-Files""-episode. BOB is the worst nightmare you can experience. Jason, Freddy & Michael Myers are only kiddie stuff in comparison. BOB is the Evil, the total sense of Evil.
I love ""FWWM"" and I will always be grateful to David Lynch. He made a place and a cast of characters that changed my view of everything in TV and cinema.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
119,Edward_Daniells,"Hated at launch, even by fans!",8,3 November 2021,"Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me(1992): even after this disappointing conclusion, a year later Lynch decided he would direct a film to at least give the audience a better explanation, Fogo walks with me or Laura Palmer's Last Days as it was in Brazil, obviously tells how was the last days of Laura still alive, different from the series, this film for not having television censorship, Lynch used all its freedom, so the atmosphere is much heavier, even containing Nudity and murder more explicit, something that was more contained in the series due to censorship, a feat of Lynch is that he managed to gather a good part of the original cast for the film, but unfortunately when the film was released when it was released, the audience and critics hated it, nowadays it is seen with different eyes and they realize that it's not as bad as they said at the launch, but when it launched it was a real bomb, the public wanted an explanation, as much as I like the final episode of Season 2 I know it no It doesn't explain almost anything, the movie still manages to cut the events better, but the audience wanted the continuation of Cooper's story, and they hated the movie. We understand a lot of what happened with Laura when we see the original series, but seeing the film is very good because you understand better what Laura went through and it's actually something very heavy, and of course you have Lynch's creative vision for the series, nowadays people understand this better and understand that it's not a bad movie, but even so after the release of Fire walks with me, Twin Peaks was shelved for 25 years, Lynch didn't intend to come back to the series, but when they arrived with an idea for the series Lynch agreed and in 2017 the series would come back and amazingly enough because much of the original Cast would come back, to finally give the worthy conclusion to Twin Peaks.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
120,triptisahu-21402,Brilliant performance by sheryl lee,9,8 September 2020,"She was brilliant in this movie, she expanded her self so much that, it looked that she is actually the laura palmer.
The entire shows raises the question on laura palmer, that why was she living a double life, why was she on drugs, why did she join one eyed jack, but this movie entirely changed my view for twin peaks. And after this movie i feel more the emotions of twin peaks. Its horrifying.
One should definitely watch this if they has watched season 1 and 2 of the show",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Her attempts to fight against the evil chasing her are simultaneously desperate and confident.The missing pieces are essential to enjoying the whole crazy ride that is Fire Walk With Me.

122,Pebble-2,Grotesquely pointless,1,2 January 2000,"The fact that 25% of voters gave this film a 10 must make me pretty stupid. I didn't see the TV series, so maybe this didn't help.I am reminded of those spoofs where modern art critics are shown paintings made by infants, where they intellectuallise over the meaning.  This film, at least in isolation, has no meaning.  It left me with the same feeling I had after I saw Eraserhead - that I had wasted time watching gratuitous surrealism - the outpourings of a crazed artist turned into 2 hours of celluloid.  I wouldn't deny the technique and expertise that has gone into the production values of the film, but that just makes it more frustrating that it couldn't have been put to better use.In summary - don't bother.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
123,mateomathew,My Favorite David Lynch Film.,10,15 March 2021,"I know that I might get hate for my opinion but I just simply have to admit this is my favorite film of the master David Lynch.I've noticed that many people dislike this film.While reading Lynch Rankings most of them put fire walk with me in 9th place below dune.But it's a film that I consider perfect in every way.I've seen all of Lynch Films and most of them crack my top 10 films of all time but this one has a special place in my heart.Now, why do people dislike the film so bad.And there are many reasons why it gets hate and I respect them but I just don't agree with them.One:No answers for the cliffhangers of the season two finale.And that is the reason which I most can understand the frustration while watching the film.But I (luckily) lived in a world where there is a season 3 and I get many answers.But I think in the Finale they tell you that Twin peaks will return 25 years later and that's what happened.Why still get some answers.The only connection we see from the finale is Annie Blackburn stating that Good Cooper is on The Lodge and Bad Cooper is Out So yeahTwo:The Tone.Twin Peaks was a funny,enthusiastic and happy.Fire Walk With Me is really dark and zero optimistic.But the tone can't be happy because the film is a about the tragedy of Laura Palmer.It had to be different from the series because it wasn't the series it was an r-rated art film.Fire walk with me talks about some topics that doesn't match with the tone from the original series so of course it had to be changed.Third (And Last):Lack of Cooper.Cooper no doubt is the best character on the series.And having a small amount of screen time during the film was a disappointment to the fans.And The reason for that is that the actor didn't want to be a typecast.And that is really understandable.But don't blame on the film.
Why do I Love the film
Acting:Sheryl Lee made an absolute brilliant performance You can see the pain of Laura through her eyes and that shows who brilliantly directed she was.Ray Wise doesn't stay behind being terrifying and steal every scene he is in.Cinematography:The original series was shot beautifully for a 90s television series but Fire Walk With my takes it to another level.The lighting techniques took the film to another level.Especially that scene in the Pink Room.Surrealism:One of Lynch's most surreal films.The Scene at the convenience store is terrifying.The scenes at the black lodge.And once scene that mark me the most was the one where the man from another place says ""I am the arm"" and with all the surreal scenes this movie takes twin peaks to another level by adding amazing concepts Like Judy,The Ring,Convince Store etc.The movie sets up everything form the stellar return.The Beatiful Ending:The last 20 minutes will keep you at the edge of your seat.Laura's death by the hands of Lealand was hunting till this day.And My Favorite Scene in Cinema History.Laura finally having peace once and for all.Free of all the pain and suffering the she lives throughout her life.It's all finally over.That sense of liberation with Laura's Laugh/Cry with the lights pointing at her face.Has to be one of the best shots in cinema history..The score in the scene is beautiful I cry every single time.

124,grinten38,Gone is the fairy tale called Twin Peaks..,7,9 July 2007,"They say it's a prequel to the series Twin Peaks. However, it is in stark contrast to the hit series. This movie is dark and raw, colors are flat, nothing comes close to the slick looks of the series. It is almost a ritual farewell by David Lynch regarding his Twin Peaks the series. Gone is that fairy tale like feeling of the series, this movie is B-style in your face drama with typical Lynch weirdness.If anything it's prequel to Lost Highway and Mulholland drive. Disturbing images, road rage, shots of a highway at night. Twisted characters. Nothing makes sense at first, you cannot take it literally, you have to read into it. When stripped of its madness, what's left is a tale of an abusive father, raping his daughter. And she uses drugs to escape this reality and ends up in the darkness of our lives. A side we all know is there, but try to deny for as long as possible. The opposite of the fairy tale so to speak.So if you're a fan of the series, this one might just be too raw for the senses. Expect violence, nudity, drugs and disturbing images.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

This movie, and the entirety of Twin Peaks helped me come to terms with my own trauma, it helped me cope, it helped me appreciate film, it helped me live. So yes, perhaps this is biased, but I don't care. In my opinion this film is more than worth the time, it comes highly recommended by me.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
126,anonymous-3,A shame...,6,1 January 2000,"Such a shame that Lynch couldn't make more out of this prequel. Mostly slaughtered by press and public and if you see the film you'll know why. However, there are a few scenes that show Lynch's talent. Still, a incoherent film. Why didn't Lynch tell the untold history of Agent Cooper? There was a lot of mystery about his past in the TV-series, yet Lynch chose to tell the story we actually already knew. Fire Walk with Me (1992) became the film that brought down Lynch. It took him a while before he could make Lost Highway (1997), which became his most daring work and (luckily) his artistic comeback.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
127,jasarthur,Disappointing like the final episode of the series.,1,27 November 2009,"My son and I enjoyed the quirkiness of the entire first and second seasons, up until the last episode, which was a total bummer. It left a bad taste in my mouth. Like that final episode of the series, this movie is really sad and confusing. One viewer says in his positive review, ""It really puts you in to Laura Palmer's world, or what's left of it, briefly... Fire Walk With Me gives something to Laura Palmer that she had been denied on television."" Well, it's quite possible that it will do the same for you. Laura was tormented and tortured, sexually abused by her father or Bob (we never truly know) and she was always in 'purgatory' if you will, always in the Red Room when we saw her, or seeing a flashback of her murder during the course of the TV show. I for one am not entertained or enriched by seeing someone's art film portrayal of psychotic, damaged people. The twisted characters like the dwarf (little person) in the Black Lodge never made any sense. It was like the end of 2001 where you had to insert your own meaning. The TV show at least had interesting characters and a plot you could half-way follow.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

You wait and wait and wait for something significant to happen, but it never does.  Blue Velvet, while weird, had some entertainment value.  This does not.  It actually made me angry to watch it.  Of course, I only had a few more hours to spend with my girlfriend before she moved to Colorado, and we were wasting them in this movie, so that might have affected my judgment.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Otherwise it would be just as bad as this movie or the new season (awful).

130,petricor,"""Do you know who I am?""",10,2 April 2015,"Twin Peaks: FWWM gets a lot of heat and it's easy to understand why. If you haven't seen the TV series, you'll be left scratching your head at what you've just seen (which is why you should see the TV series for the scenes to exert their full impact). If you have seen the TV series, you might wonder what happened to it and its iconic style when it transitioned to the big screen. The thing is FWWM isn't about returning to Twin Peaks per se. It's about what really happened to Laura Palmer, or at least a very small glimpse into the horrors she experienced, and that can never be sugarcoated. I imagine David Lynch didn't want to sugarcoat serious issues with classic Twin Peaks humor. That's what the show is for -- showing an investigation and the lives of the townfolk with a sense of campiness and therefore sterility and detachment. No matter how emotional the grieving was, the show couldn't really capture the horror of Laura's nightmares, because it skirted around the issues. Having seen the show, I knew what happened to Laura, but did I really know? Did I really understand the scope of her situation? Apparently little, because FWWM absolutely terrified me. Now, don't get me wrong. There are physically scarier movies out there with better jump scares and grislier images, but that's not my point. FWWM terrifies, because despite its weird Lynch-esque symbolism, it is able to hit close to home through its everyday characters, setting, and situations. It asks all of us to walk alongside Laura and by doing so, it spares nothing, because the truth requires everything. It demands our attention. So while some will find FWWM to be far too raw, sad, and humorless, Laura's gripping story deserved to be told from her perspective. Only then will we be able to say we know. We truly know.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
131,toasters-50516,Better Than The Series,9,17 September 2018,The movie explains the series more succinctly than the series does. I recommend the movie over the series although the series isn't bad by itself.,Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
132,jerome-23,Neo-Gothic-Archetypal Horror,10,30 April 2006,"This is a horrific film. The whole Twin Peaks phenomenon to which I was a young participant in the early '90s' is a disturbed, in-depth study of a case of long-term paedophillic incest and physical torturous abuse of a struggling and high-achieving teenage girl by her strongly socio-and-psychopathic, high-standing, serial killer father.The scene where Leyland is ?Zeus? being pulled by a chariot of Laura and Ronette is pure neo-Gothic-archetypal horror that I don't believe I have seen so intensely portrayed in any other scene in cinema.The fact that the young Jennifer Lynch, David's daughter, wrote the book of Laura's Diary where the torturous abuse is described in almost unbearable detail something that is not mentioned in the film or TV series is a relevant and intriguing fact.The film is discheveled and more so than an average surreal Lynch film, although it turning into a more intense study of Laura's death for already fans is captivating in its entrancement.Leyland dies, in the story to which this is a prequel.

It is totally unlike his better films like Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead. Its hard to quite put my finger on it, but his other movies just really work, Twin Peaks doesn't. If you watch this film it almost looks like the unfinished blueprint of Lynch's ideas for his better future films in which he really masters his craft. This film seems unfinished, and uneventful compared to his other movies. Twin Peaks just cannot stand on its own. Nonetheless Lynch is still the man, and basically only stupid people who don't understand his movies dislike all of them.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
134,csbob447,Fan who is conflicted,6,27 September 2018,"I am honestly conflicted with this movie. As a Twin Peaks fan, I was excited to see this movie, especially after finishing the third/Return/limited season of the show. I knew that the movie was a prequel to the original series about the last few days of Laura's life, but I thought there would have been more honestly besides that.There are two ways to watch this movie, either as a fan of Twin Peaks or as an outsider looking in. As an outsider looking in, I can't really recommend watching this before seeing the show. It certainly would make sense given that there really isn't much new to be added, but at the same time the movie is relying on the fact that you have seen the show before watching the movie, with how little characterization there is with Dale Cooper, the relationship with Leo and Shelly, the Black Lodge, and the final episode of the original run of the show. And as a fan of the show, there isn't much to really take away from this outside of the original show, outside of seeing Laura before she died (BTW Sheryl Lee is great in this) and more info about the Black Lodge, as well as info to the the Return and how the film bridged both series together like what happened at the last episode of the second season and with David Bowie's character, Philip Jeffries (Bowie is really weird in this movie BTW). We don't really learn anything new that the show already told us before besides providing a visual aid, albeit a more graphic visual aid, and the stuff with Chester Desmond and the investigation of Teresa Banks feels completely pointless because, again, we don't learn anything new that wasn't in the show.So just judging the movie on it's own...well it's a mixed bag. The acting is all around pretty good, even with the more goofier acting, but given that it's true to the show it's excusable. Sheryl Lee is great in this as she really does shine more as Laura in this film than in the show, returning actors like Ray Wise, Kyle MacLachlan, Dana Ashbrook, James Marshall (even though James is the worst!), and Harry Dean Stanton are pretty great, and Moria Kelly fills in Donna's shoes nicely. The weak link in this film is Chris Isaak as Chester Desmond who is just so dull in this film, although he doesn't really get a lot to in this role. This movie is also peak Lynch at his oddest and most horrifying. The movie can be interpreted as repression and the torment and mental strains of abuse on a victim. So many scenes here are truly unnerving and uncomfortable to watch, it isn't an easy watch, which is definitely a high compliment considering that's what the movie goes for. And without the restrictions of TV ratings, the movie is uncompromising with the sex and violence, feeling like this is truly what Twin Peaks should have been if it wasn't on TV or produced by HBO. Unfortunately the structure is off. The first act of the film is about the investigation of Teresa Banks that is absolutely unnecessary and goes nowhere. Scenes often end with fade to black cuts, like it's going to cut to a commercial break, that just feels weird and unnecessary. There are characters that feel absolutely pointless to the narrative of the film. The soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti is great. Often eerie and unnerving, but also beautiful and soothing, much like the show's score as well. It enhances the film while also feeling like it can fit along with the same universe as Twin Peaks (Badalamenti did score the show BTW), as well as a good listen on it's own. Also the minimalist reworking of Laura's Theme is fantastic!Honestly the big issue with the film is like a lot of shows that are adapted to the big screen, it is made for the fans more than anyone new. There's not a lot of characters that are fleshed out because they are in the show. And with Fire Walks with Me, I'd have a hard time seeing anyone who has not seen the show be confused as hell after seeing the film. It works well as watching this movie after finishing the original series, but again it's a prequel and not much new is learned from the film. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. There's a lot good here, but overall I didn't get much out of it besides an unnerving experience. Which could be applauded as a success, but with how murky the end result is, it's just hard to recommend the finished product.But seriously watch the original run of Twin Peaks it's absolutely fantastic!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
135,Deran_Ludd,The essential apocrypha of the essential Pacific Northwest TV series,10,20 May 2003,"Suffering and redemption. That is the theme of this movie. The task of this movie is to put into context the amazing TV series David Lynch produced, Twin Peaks. The movie is far more intense then the series was  as a whole. Although certain episodes are also an epiphany. In the movie we get to experience the desolation that is the core of small town United States. Far beyond Faulkner, Ford, or Himes. Here we have incest as the heart of the American Dream. This film is beyond violent. beyond horrible. The mirror most ""American's"" feign ignorance of. Despite his rightist politics, or perhaps because of them, Lynch finds the soul of divulges the most horrid and agonizingly truthful parts of life in white middle class United States.

As it acts as a prequel to the series, it can only be truly appreciated alongside the series itself. But aside from that, this film is quite unlike any other you will see. A definite Lynch classic. Not as surreal as Eraserhead, and slightly more down to earth than Lost Highway, this is Lynch at his surreal/realistic best. Also, it was one of the few films that made me yell aloud out of fright.

137,lowth2000,6 out of 10,6,30 November 2001,"This film is based on a very good and different series.  At times the series seemed to drag a little and I presumed that in having to compress the material to film length this would cause the writers to further distill their product.  The result diverges from the series.Very quickly, almost immediately a strange atmosphere is created.  This is highly commendable, and this is improved by the inclusion of two new characters (the detectives) who are both interesting and usefull in moving the plot.  The reintroduction of the amusing figure of Gordon Cole is an instant Triumph, and the use of the excelent Kyle Mclachlen increases the appeal for established Twin Peeks fans.  I love the introduction it works really well, asks a lot of questions and gives a good airing to Lynch's humour.However, after the introduction the film starts to go downhill.  I have watched and throughly enjoyed many of Lynch's films, but this is the only one in which I have got bored.  I even started channel flicking towards the end.  The reason for this diminuendo is the process of focussing on Laura Palmer.  She just isn't the character you really expected her to be, and nor is she interesting.  This main body of the film also requires a lot of experience and knowledge of Twin Peeks to understand it.  This is surely a failure.  Old characters are used once (eg the log lady, David Bowee, and Bobby's future girlfriend and her husband) who simply need not be in.  They are only there to appeal to people like me who had seen the film.  Perhaps with the exception of Bowee, they offer nothing nothing to the film in plot or even tone.Laura Palmers last days simply are not interesting enough.  Perhaps the film should have focussed on something else entirely or brought in other sub plots.  I appreciate that sub plots could have been a disaster in this film causing a total lack of focuss, but the main story was rather dull. It also needed to be more mysterious, by following Laura as the main character too much was explained, and the audience felt that more needed to be explained. I would have preffered another, a more normal charcter to have been the focuss. Maybe Donna should have been the main character with occasional focuss on Laura.  The mystery was lost.I also did not like the potrayal of Leeland.  Leeland was a nice guy who's dark side was well hidden - in the film he was obviously a fruit cake and the Bob - Leeland connection was shown all too soon.Overall I found the movie dissapointing but not without some very good points.  The introduction was excelent.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

This film's artistry took me beyond the aesthetic and intellectual, and into a phsychological landscape I haven't been before or since.One must grasp the chaos, or have been a witness to it in their own reality, to feel the depth of this film and Lynch's use of contrasting landscapes of innocence vs. evil, duality, contradiction, femininity, nostalgia, Etc., that somehow manage to make perfect sense: as long as we don't try to make sense of it. This film is about getting lost. It must be intuited, felt in the dark, to be truly appreciated. It's the only cinematic experience that I call ""magical"". I was unable to review this in an impersonal way.Besides that, and for those who don't really ""get it"", the acting, directing, production, writing, plot, Etc. all make the film worth seeing more than once.

It's just I as a cinema goer am just drowning in Hollywood excrement- hundreds of films that are basically photocopies of each other- and then there is Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Lynch's darkest and most nihilistic vision. You could argue that it was stubborn of him to do it like this but what compared to Die Hard 38 or whatever it's a relief. For me the film encapsulates a sense of dread and inevitability better than any other horror film, Lynch's familiar theme regarding the dark underbelly of the middle class being taken to the extreme. The acting is great, and Angelo Badalamenti is the best film composer in the world bar none. You can complain that it is too surreal, but it's a film that expects it's audience to have an opinion about what it means, the final scene being my favorite scene in any movie ever regardless of how you choose to read it. You can read many things into its scenes, it is so unlike these popcorn films you struggle to remember 5 minutes after the lights go up- I love the fact 10 years after it was made there it is still actively discussed on the internet.

Also, many writers deliberately refuse to tie everything up at the end of a film, preferring to provoke the viewer into speculation. But in this case, the viewer is left feeling merely frustrated at the end because of all the unresolved questions.

145,nhawdon,"A Disappointing, Unworthy Successor to the Masterful Show",6,17 May 2017,"I would like to preface this review by saying how much I loved Twin Peaks. If it hadn't been for the Twilight Zone, it would be my favorite show of all time. It's how deeply I loved and appreciated the show that led to my disappointment upon finally watching the movie.People often extol David Lynch as a visionary, an under-appreciated master. Personally, I think he's a talented man, who excels at the avant-garde. Mulholland Dr. and Eraserhead come to mind as perfect examples of this. The problem comes when he is given way too much creative freedom. Although I don't know too much about the production of FWWM, I'm thinking very few people intervened, or reined Lynch in for the entire process. The result was a jumbled, bleak, depressing, and just generally off putting mess.Part of what made the show so great was its ambiance. When I watch it, I still get this warm, fuzzy feeling. Despite the dark subject matter, somehow Twin Peaks still seemed peaceful, friendly, and almost otherworldly in its charm. There are little moments sprinkled throughout the series bursting with folksy humor. It's almost as funny as it is suspenseful. In part due to it's folksy-ness, the whole town felt separated from the real world. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up in that kind of place, but I felt just like Dale Cooper; delighted with everything I saw.That's all gone in the movie. No charm, no fuzzy feeling, no humor. It's bleak, disturbing, and unnecessarily dark. It didn't have the same sensibility as the show. It felt more like Silence of the Lambs, which, don't get me wrong is an amazing movie, but it's not right for Twin Peaks.Now to my other problem: everything else. From David Lynch's comic relief character from the show who he shoehorned into the movie for seemingly no reason, as he provides no comic relief whatsoever, to the uncharismatic Dale Cooper lookalike and his somehow less charismatic partner, to the actual Dale Cooper, who seems more like an emotionless clone of Cooper than anything, to David Bowie's remarkably unnecessary character and his dreadful American accent, to the discount Black Lodge with its numerous pointlessly weird spirits, who all eat creamed corn for some reason, to the x-rated after-school special life of Laura Palmer, to the soul crushingly disturbing incest/rape ""climax,"" which was in fact nothing more than an extended mashup of people screaming and crying which was either actually two hours or just felt like two hours, Fire Walk With Me was a mess.It seemed more like David Lynch feverishly trying to figure out how much nonsense, violence, and nudity he could pack into two and a half hours, simply because he was finally free from network standards, than it did a cohesive story. I get that Lynch doesn't like it when people try to make sense of his movies, but it's incredibly frustrating as a viewer, especially when he doesn't even throw me a bone.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
146,lm_meireles,"Goodbye, Laura",9,16 July 2019,"«Through the darkness of future past,
The magician longs to see.
One chants out between two worlds...»Another step of surrealism in Lynch's filmography, and quite a strong one. Fire Walk with Me is a psychological horror picture that depicts the last days of Laura Palmer and her descent into madness, in the superficially peaceful and quiet town of Twin Peaks. In many ways similar to Blue Velvet (1986), it terrifyingly exposes the bizarre underworld behind what seems so pure and innocent, a bit like Laura herself. With an approach nothing similar to the TV-series, it's like seeing David Lynch, free from all constrictions, in automatic pilot: it has all the elements of a great Lynch movie, from the hypnotizing score of Angelo Badalamenti to the seductive and, mostly, nightmarish moments involving Sheryl Lee's bravura performance. Of course, the movie is so dense and full of mystery, it has its flaws. However, if we consider the best moments that this parallel universe presents us, we can almost forget them. Although it doesn't work as a puzzle solver, but as the opposite, it's a must watch and rewatch for every Twin Peaks fan.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
147,Ian-Broomey-2002,Lynch,8,20 April 2021,"A prequel to the show, which differs from the show and imbraces it movie format. Leaving the off beat tone for a dark and gritty drama. Lynch is the master of setting an atmosphere of dread. Done via imagery, sound design and the brilliant performances throughout. The themes of assault and addiction are prominent and is shown through the character of Laura Palmer. We she her decent into anxiety and addiction with her unable to cope with the abuse and horror in her life.

The subject matter was needlessly disturbing. Lynch couldn't make a coherent piece of film to save his life. I could go on and on, but this piece of crap isn't worth it.

149,roessi,Watch it on the Big Screen,10,8 July 1999,"The first 4 or 5 times I watched this movie I had to watch it on television (video). I really did like it, I thought it was a great movie.

It ""works"" much better on the Big Screen (and perhaps you have to know it to enjoy it...).",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
150,Saila,Not all films are for fun,10,21 August 2001,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!! ONLY FOR THOSE WHO KNOW ABOUT BOB AND EVERYTHING.Many people regard Twin Peaks -Fire walk with me  as rubbish, because it isn't as ""funny"" as the series. No, it isn't funny. Being haunted by spirits, hooked with narcotics and sexually used by own father is hardly considered funny. The film is about the last week of Laura Palmer. It explains her sudden and cruel death. I don't think there's anything funny about that.Lynch is the master of macabre suspense. He creates a dark dream world where Laura tries to struggle against her death. She knows she's going to die and she finds out who is going to kill her. She finds out who is Bob, the bogeyman who's been sexually abusing her from child and who has caused her to change from daddy's little girl to a drug-using nymphomaniac. Lynch doesn't give viewer any relief or hope that everything is going to be fine. He drags us through the living hell of Laura Palmer to her unevitable death.If you rated this film under 8, you should watch Disney's animations. Or are you afraid of the dark...side.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

As a devout Twin Peaks (TV-series) fan, I enjoy this one a lot. It starts out sort of slow-ish, but accelerates into a fiery storm of what is later shown in the series.Had it not been for the cast omissions (compared to the series) I'd given this a 9 out of 10. As it is, it gets a 7. The replaced cast is by no means bad, but the original cast & scenery would have added to the intense experience this movie really is.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
152,behappysmile,The Fan Edit is Better than the Theatrical Cut,9,1 August 2017,"If you are currently watching ""Twin Peaks"" on Showtime and are a little confused then you should watch ""Fire Walk With Me"". As much as I am enjoying some of the new episodes of ""Twin Peaks"" it is a little strange!I know people that have never seen the show before are saying one thing ""What the Hell""? I can't blame them because the show seems to be catering to the die hard fans of the show. Most of all it is catering to people that know and remember every character from not only the show but the film ""Fire Walk With Me"". Now I was always a fan of the television show. I was mad that the show had ended with a cliffhanger. I was happy to hear that ""Fire Walk With Me"" was coming. A year later when it was released I was shocked that it did not solve the television cliffhanger however I did enjoy the film. I thought it was strange but very good. Fans of the show hated ""Fire"" because most the cast from the television show were not featured. It also din't help that the film was too violent for some fans. In the television show it was about ""Who killed Laura Palmer. ""Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me"" The film was about why she murdered. I will admit the film is very confusing. The GREEN RING was a new element that was never mentioned in the television show. Also what was really annoying to me was that the murder of Laura slightly differs from what we were told on the television show. In the television show we are told (Through Waldo the Bird) that Laura kept saying ""Leo No"" and that Laura had a poker chip in her stomach. These events are not shown in ""Fire"". The assembly cut of the film was rumored to have run over 5 hours. When the the film was released it ran 135 minutes. Most of all the film did not resolve the cliffhanger from the television show. Before the film was released in the USA it Premiered at the ""Cannes Film Festival"" and it was booed. Now I am not sure if they saw a different version of ""Fire"" but the film was panned everywhere. This was a shock to David because the pilot to the television show was ""The Best Reviewed"" television pilot of all time. Well most fans had herd before ""Fire's"" release was that there was many cut scenes that featured the television cast. For years the fans were hoping that those scenes would turn up somewhere. BE it an extended television cut of the film or a special edition on home video. After all in 1984 David Lynch directed the film ""Dune"". A few years later when the film when shown on television it had about an hour of never before seen footage so hopes were high that this would be the case for ""Fire"" but that never happened until 2014 when David Lynch finally released the deleted footage. This was 22 years after the film was released. However these scenes were not edited back into the film. David Lynch likes the theatrical cut of ""Fire"" so he did not want to tamper with it. However fans did and someone who goes by Q2 made a great edit that included the deleted scenes and in reality it is a better film however, it does run 3 1/2 hours! Best News is that it does solve the cliffhanger from the television show! What is strange is that for a fan edit is that it runs smoother than the theatrical edition. The original theatrical version is shorter but seems longer! Now there is a few scenes that were re- edited back in that were not needed. On the plus side the fan edit does improve the viewers vision on the problems that Laura had to face in the last 7 days of her life! If you ever get the chance to see this edit it is worth watching, It makes ""Fire"" a masterpiece!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
153,briandaniel67,disappointing,3,24 September 2002,"My friends and I spent the last four months watching the TV series in sequence, and we really enjoyed it.(The following may be spoiling.)For me, the ending to the series was not a surprise, I'm used to Lynch's predilection for the unintelligible and the surreal.For me (a realist) an artists purpose is more to communicate the meaningful than to portray the uninterpretable.  I usually see Lynch's endings as a cop-out, and a disintegration of the plot.Unhappily, I saw the whole of his ""Fire Walk With Me"" in this fashion. None of it made much sense and it never came together as a whole for me.  I also missed many of the regular characters: Audrey, Sheriff Truman, Mr. Horn, Pete...I voted this film a 3 out of 10.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
154,another_place,Speechless,10,24 August 2000,"This movie leaves me speechless. There are no words to describe it, it is an absolute masterpiece. It perfectly describes the absurdity and desperation of everyday life. It gives no hope because there is none. It is incomprehensible because that's the way life is. It is the definitive metaphor of reality. Nothing has any meaning, nothing really matters, there is no cause and no consequence, only casualness and loneliness.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
155,simonm-17313,must watch for fans of the series,9,21 May 2020,"I just finished binge watching the series for the first time and then went straight into this prequel film without knowing what to expect. And I think overall this stands up better than the series. Up there with the best episodes for cinematography and atmosphere for sure, and with none of the subplots that plagued season 2. I even enjoyed the scene setting previous FBI investigation, though once it introduced the characters we know it upped a gear.This is much darker than the series, a proper horror film really in a ""shining"" kind of style. The atmosphere created by the film, from the opening credits to the end, is perfectly unsettling. Aided of course by yet more great music from Angelo Badalamenti, and Lynch's grotesque closeups. Especially knowing the whole time the awful conclusion this story is heading to, is really disturbing. Yes, it gives no answers, but it does deepen the awareness of the black lodge characters somewhat and rounds out Laura's character - Sheryl Lee is amazing portraying her.It is a slight downside that some of the series' best characters don't show up; indeed I expected some insight into Laura's role at one eyed jack's and her relationship with Ben Horne which didn't get much elaboration in the series. And obviously would have wanted some Audrey scenes. It was a good decision to have the film focus primarily on Laura though.There are scenes that are very hard to make sense of (the Bowie one, in particular) but they added to the dream-like feel of the film and the creation of more questions. I for one am glad that this film kept the mysteries of Twin Peaks alive, as providing certain answers would have likely been unsatisfying, whereas this way we are left to imagine for ourselves to fill in some of the gaps in our understanding, which for me is way more fun.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
156,mark_leeforshaw,Underrated tour-de-force,8,24 April 2001,"I am a great admirer of David Lynch's films, but what I admire most about TP: FWWM is the central performance by Sheryl Lee. In my opinion, Lee gives one of the most extraordinary, visceral performances of the 1990s in this underrated film. She transforms an iconic but actually fairly notional television character into an unforgettable cinematic presence, with great complexity and depth. It is true that Laura Palmer contains elements of cliche and perhaps even a kind of sentimental misogyny (beautiful but occasionally sluttish high-school prom-queen, whose glamorous facade masks hidden tragedy) but this is more a fault of Lynch's writing than Lee's performance. Rarely has an actor put more into a role only to be met with such hostility or indifference at the hands of critics and the public. I still hold out hopes that Lee's career will one day enjoy greater visibility and lead her to the roles and the praise she undoubtedly is capable of winning.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
157,huntthejest,Worst film ever made?,1,23 May 2008,"I would've given it a zero, except the lowest that can be given is a one. I actually created a profile to write a review of this film, because, previously, it had a six out of ten. I hope to rectify that, assuming that the original score was based off the only other person on this planet that had seen that movie having some sort of learning disability. That being said, I congratulate them on successfully using the internet, they are obviously making wonderful progress. Anyways, if this film has a point, it is lost on me. The story makes no sense to any sane person, and, as an insane person, I think the plot sucks. Its like having a rape fantasy, then realizing you wouldn't enjoy being raped; except far worse, and normally you don't pay to rent rape fantasies(unless no one hugged you as a child) and they don't waste an hour and a half of your life(unless you get very in depth in your daydreams) and make you lose respect for any actor that you see in it. That being said, no recognizable stars in this movie have big parts, so you can't blame them for being in it, because they probably only read enough of the script to do their part, and didn't realize that the script was written by a sixteen year old prostitute on acid. Assuming there was a script to begin with. Well, that being said, it is just one movie-goer's opinion, so, by all means, please watch this film and rate it yourself. Hopefully, those of us with at least 12 percent brain function left can eventually get that star count down to a more appropriate level.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

159,joelmeggs,The final word on Fire Walk With Me,7,12 March 2005,"It's difficult to come to terms with this movie if you're a huge fan of the TV series and a huge fan of David Lynch.There are a lot of problems with this movie. I believe that ultimately the Twin Peaks formula just didn't translate to the big screen.The first half hour is a completely different movie. And it's fantastic: definitely the best part of the movie. Then it snaps into Twin Peaks mode. But we forget what Twin Peaks was all about, and so the intentionally corny dialog and melodrama just seem like corny dialog and melodrama instead of the campy irony that the TV Series had. In the TV Show, the occasional shots of the soap opera ""Invitation to Love"" really drove the point home.The production value of a movie instead of a grainy TV show is working against this movie, as well.And then there is just no light-hearted fun, here. All the charm of Twin Peaks is subsumed by focusing on its dark underbelly. Swearing, violence, incest, drug abuse. If you read the original script for the movie, there was more of the original wacky and charming characters, but it never made it to the final version.Finally, so much time has to be spent setting up everything so that it aligns with the show: that's the problem with prequels.Yet with all these problems, this movie can't be dismissed. It has a lot of great, weird moments. The first half-hour, the red-room stuff, the cream corn, the grandmother and the magician, etc. It's a chore to sit through a lot of the stuff that depicts Laura Palmer's descent, but it's worth it to get to the wonderful bits of weirdness. But, alas, it never resurrects the indescribable magic of the TV Series.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Its greatness is in the different interpretations it offers. FWWM is a ballad to the dead Laura Palmer. Lynch created her, and now he has brought her to her death and final redemption in the most beautiful and touching style. This is not a TP movie. Most of the main characters are left out. This movie is Lynch dealing with Laura's persona and he does it with such care and loving that its a joy to watch.

But for a peaks freak who loved to watch the famous tv series again and again and again while eating loads of donuts and drinking to much coffee this is pure cinematic LSD... It is just like you would have entered the black lodge in the forest of Twin Peaks and left it on the wrong side. It is madness. It is pretty unreal and it tastes much more bitter than the sweet-cherry-pie-tv-stuff... It seems they have used a different set-design to the tv series sometimes... Some parts of this movie have to be classic. There are so beautiful scenes in this movies which are meant for a ""best-of-lynch-gallery"". But I recognized that the audience at a local cinema wasn´t able to follow the whole thing entirely. 135 min. have been to much to a lot of german people. But I loved it. It was ... a ride ... again. It was terrible but it was beautiful. I loved it. Some of my favorite movies so far. I saw myself in it. And I was shocked. Thanks, mr. Lynch, You described it as a cherry-pie to all this furious Peaks Freaks out there and it was that way. But you gave some LSD in the cherry pie. This is one of the Lynch-Movies which I am not going to show Spielberg-Lovers. I guess they won´t like it as much as e.g. ""Blue velvet""... by the way: Lynch has gone HARDCORE in the 90s, hasn´t he?

This movie, just like Mulholland Drive for example, is closer to a dream than to the common film plot. The point is not so much what the film is about, but mostly how it translates feelings into video and music. Although I mus admit that I did NOT linked all elements together to build up an overall understanding of the movie, I still really got entertained. I gave the movie 6/10 because I found it harder to link these together: although I really love Lynch movies, this movie is clearly the one I had the most difficulty to understand. For those who find the courage to embark onto a Lynch journey, this is a must. But beware: reality and dream are mixed together into some sort of frightening feeling that what you think is coming up will eventually happen. The central scene in Laura's bedroom is expectable, but still not easy to foresee for those like me who have never seen the series TPeaks ahead. As a consequence, the viewer feels like he expects something but still wonders (and hopes) he's not right. As usual with Lynch, please do not stop the movie: this must be a one time experiment.

When I finally caught it on video I was simply mesmerized!!! David Lynch at his wonderful best!! That one viewing started me on a quest to track down all 29 episodes of the TV series and that in turn converted me into what I refer to as a ""Mystic Warrior"".  You'll have to see the show to know what that means but I much prefer that term to ""Peakie""!  Ask my favorite movie:  I'll say TWIN PEAKS, FIRE WALK WITH ME!!!

When the plot switch gears about a half hour in, Lynch builds on this feeling of menace thats lurks just below the surface of suburbia. It is in this section of the film that lynch is at his best, creating some truly unsettling scenes of terror and suspense, as well as some equally unnerving implications....Then Twin Peaks begins to implode on itself. My enthusiasm gradually turned into frustration and boredom. David Lynch has always been a somewhat self indulgent filmmaker, but this takes the cake. Every promising aspect of this film goes out the window and the film becomes a headache to watch, it turns into a showcase for half baked sub plots, obnoxious characters (it doesn't help that the unusually poor acting, especially by the lead actress..ugh..become much more noticeable once the film starts its tail dive)and incoherent and mostly uninteresting imagery.

171,rosenfield10-1,This film has remained my all-time favorite.,10,14 September 2004,"""Twin Peaks:Fire Walk With Me"" may be the most underrated film in history. I have seen the entire television series several times, and this film is an outstanding prequel. From the acting of an incredible cast to the award-winning style of direction by David Lynch, and from the haunting mood set by Angelo Badalamenti's heartbreaking musical compositions to the realistically offbeat screenplay scripted by Lynch and Robert Engels, this unique film easily rivals other Lynch classics such as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Eraserhead"", whether you have seen the ""Twin Peaks"" television series or not. It has the absurdities of ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Pink Floyd-The Wall"", the sorrow of ""Boys Don't Cry"", the shock value of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Wild at Heart"", and the humor of ""Fargo"". A very distinct feeling is obtained when watching this film; a feeling that guides the viewer into an understanding of the horrific and otherworldly events. I first viewed this movie in 1992 on video before ever having seen the television series, and it attracted me as an unfinished puzzle very much. A mystery left somewhat unsolved leaves the viewer to imagine and wonder and re-live. Along with the Peabody award-winning television pilot (viewed by 35 million people when aired), the Emmy award-winning television series, and the numerous books and recordings that evolved, ""Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me"" becomes larger and even more grand. Sheryl Lee's performance as Laura Palmer remains my favorite by an actress, and, in my opinion, the greatest ever by a leading lady. She is haunted, distant, flirtatious, terrified, confused, demanding, and innocent. Ray Wise as Leland Palmer is one of my all-time favorite performances by an actor. He has more expression of warmth, deception, guilt, and anger in his face than most actors could ever work up. ""Fire Walk With Me"" is a severely underrated film which holds up, on all counts, as an award-winner and a cult classic. With the television series ending in a factually unpredictable manner, the movie lives on both as a sensational piece of cinema and as an unfinished and burning mystery; a mystery that all loyal David Lynch and ""Twin Peaks"" fans wish would be solved in another ""Twin Peaks"" production by Lynch and Mark Frost involving all of the Lynch Mob performers and creators that have made the world of ""Twin Peaks"" worthy of it's current cult status. This film has remained my all-time favorite.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
172,ni-8,Darker than dark,9,26 September 2007,"Characteristic of David Lynch, this film is typically surreal and blacker than the sky on a moonless night.Following up on the TV series this film picks up before the series started and explains it all. I doubt very much that Fire Walk With Me stands up on its own but it does stand as very much more than a TV spin off.*spoiler alert* The mystery of who killed Laura Palmer that ran through the series (if anyone has not seen the series - sorry she does die at the end) is explained here. What we see is her slide toward the inevitable conclusion. What should be tender and romantic, sometimes even erotic is crude and seedy and often just nasty. This is as it should be.As we saw on TV a steady stream of hints is presented as to who her killer would be. It is a testimony to the vision of David Lynch that I was able to identify the killer early in the series, this being down to a professional familiarity with some of these matters. Even the red herrings could not throw me off because they only ever seemed to be an irrelevant distraction. This standard of observation is carried forward into the spin off movie.Missing for fans of the series are some of the side characters and sub plots, so don't come expecting to learn much more about the mill or the hotel or whatever. The biggest disappointment is that there was never a second film to follow up on some of those. There are a lot of unanswered questions (where did the missing FBI agents go - what about the paper letters - what does the blue rose mean). What the film does deal with makes sense of some of the key mysteries of the TV series. As far as it goes this is a fine piece of work.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
173,gilnerjohn40,You can't miss this film,10,18 March 2014,"This film went over everybody's heads when it came out. The reality is, it is definitely one of Lynch's best films. One of the most dark, experiment, and boundary pushing for sure. So terrifying at times I couldn't even bare it. Sheryl Lee's performance is giving me goosebumps just thinking about it. So operatic, so dire, so raw. Sure, it is different from the show, but that isn't an issue because its beautiful. The end of the film when Laura Palmer is being killed is up there with my favorite scenes in any film. The way Lynch uses bright spotlights to increase intensity is so original and natural. The music, the pace, the very disturbing uncertain feeling you get for Laura throughout the entire film makes it truly bone-rattling. If you like Lynch, or if you think you might even maybe like Lynch, you HAVE to see this film. So underrated and under-admired.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

For Twin Peaks fans, it's too much of a disjointed rehash. You learn nothing new from watching this film. For the newbies, however, this film doesn't teach anything - it's too confusing to make sense without having seen the series. It's a lose-lose situation for Lynch.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
176,OrigamiDoug,A great but disturbing film...,9,20 January 2003,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of David Lynch's movies.  Even if I don't completely understand them the first time around, they always evoke a strong emotional response from me.  This film was no different.  It was alternately beautiful and horrifying due to the duality of Laura's life. Knowing that Laura was ultimately going to end up dead created a sense of dread that stayed with me throughout the entire film.  Scenes such as Mike confronting Leland on the road and David Bowie's appearance as Agent Jeffries frightened me, for some reason, more than any horror film I've ever seen.  But the scenes that show Laura accepting her fate are the most chilling of all; here is a girl who, under different circumstances, would have been a pure and normal individual.  But she was corrupted by an evil force and instead used her inner strength to choose to die rather than succumb completely to BOB.  Sheryl Lee's performance was flawless, and the rest of the cast turned in great performances as well.  TP:FWWM is my favorite Lynch film, and one of my top five favorites.  9 out of 10",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
177,jgtamblin,A certain must for Twin Peaks fans,10,18 April 2007,"Being an avid fan of the cult series Twin Peaks, the prequel movie Fire Walk With Me was greatly anticipated and received. I do believe watching the series first will help the viewer understand the movie a lot better. And despite the one major question being answered ""Who killed Laura Palmer?"" in the wake of it's revelation it leaves more questions to be asked. Different people have different views and opinions on what the whole Twin Peaks thing is about. I believe that this is part of the beauty of both the movie and the series, Lynch leaves it up to you to decide what you think has really happened. As with other works i.e Mullholland Drive your own interpretation is a key element to the enjoyment of the film. Sheryl Lee really bought Laura Palmer to life for me, and although she featured in the series as Madeline (laura's cousin) she was somewhat missing in the T.V show, here in Fire Walk With Me you can really start to understand Laura Palmer and all the darkness that lies around her. The now dead Frank Silva who plays BOB is in my mind on of the most frighting characters in film history. With other great performances from the likes of Ray Wise, Kyle MacLachlan and David Lynch himself this is a must see for Twin Peaks fans who want to gain access to the last seven days leading up to the death of Laura Palmer. A haunting classic with some answers, but not enough. 10/10.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
178,stacktdeck,Peak Freak,9,23 May 2002,"""Twin Peaks"" was the best thing to happen to television in years. It paved the way for fan-favorites like ""X-Files"" and ""Six Feet Under."" Even distant cousins like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" owe that surreality, and that horror-opera continuity, to David Lynch's amazing contribution to television. And as much as I enjoyed Lynch's ability to re-work the failed TV pilot ""Mulholland Drive"" into the very enjoyable film it became, I'd still give my left arm for it to have remained on the air for a few seasons. Maybe it's the additional subtlety that Lynch was forced to apply when dealing with the much more touchy medium of TV (sponsors only want the type of nudity and swearing that will GUARANTEE better ratings,) but I think TV's a medium that he excelled in, and for that reason, the SERIES ""Twin Peaks"" will always be better than it's cinematic sibling. ""Fire Walk With Me"" is for ""Twin Peaks"" fans. No one else will enjoy this movie. No one else will GET this movie. And if you do, then you have more surreal and creative tastes than I do. But for all of the Peak-Freaks, this movie was the last hurrah, one more crazy, red-curtained dance party for a show that we all felt ended too soon. If you love Lynch, if you can quote every stupid line about coffee and cherry pie that falls from Agent Cooper's lips, then ""Fire Walk With Me"" will remain one of the greatest movies of all time.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

180,dave-879-315429,Pieces of the Jigsaw Puzzle,8,25 December 2013,"Warning : This review may contain spoilers and utter nonsense. Saw this (in French)when it came out in 1992. Tried to watch it again a few years ago and thought: ""that is so 1990s"" Watched it again last night and while I still think it has faults (way too much crying) for a TP fan it is an important part of the puzzle as it adds so much to Laura's life we wouldn't otherwise have known. I am glad I read some of these reviews before I watched it as it told me something about David Lynch's storytelling I hadn't thought about for a long while, namely: 1: His movies are are like an abstract art canvas there to provoke thought rather than offer any ""answers"" 2: There is no clear division between the world of reality and the world of dream, as shown where Laura asks her father if he had been back to the house. Yes she knows it and wants to see if he will lie but she also wants to see if it was a dream. 3: The Red Room and it's accompanying architecture follows no rules of time and space. Anything is possible and there may be symbols thrown in by Lynch just to give us something to talk about.I think this movie has aged well in that is has aged. Let me explain: made in the 90s there was a 50s look to it. Now viewed in 2013 the 90s style (hair, clothes)also looks like a parody of another time. I would like to see a follow up to it using the original actors as they are now (some of whom look older than their years) with the premise that they have travelled back to 1990 from the future. In the last episode of the TV series Cooper is shown as an old man, with gray hair and old man thin-ness. On the contrary when you look at Kyle Maclacklan today he has middle age man heaviness which is more appropriate. (Why did they think he would get thinner as he got older, just think of all that cherry pie) Going by the TP festivals in the US and the UK the interest is still huge. There is of course a seediness to the movie that could never have been shown on television. The ""Pink Room"" nudity with accompanying music shows us the underbelly of the prim and prissy American Homecoming Queen. Drugs, prostitution, bondage (laura gets tied up), motel, money, murder, madness. Jim Morrison would have loved to have been there and in the world of David Lynch, he probably was.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
181,ilovemoovies,Do not Expect the Television Show here,10,12 May 2017,"The television show ""Twin Peaks"" was one of the most influential show of all time. It was ground breaking. It also broke the rules and sometimes that worked against the show. In the original show of ""Twin Peaks"" a FBI agent Dale Cooper comes to the small town of ""Twin Peaks"" to investigate the death of Laura Palmer. As we follow Cooper we see everything on the surface is just that ""surface"". What is behind closed doors at any residence is what drove the mystery. When the show ended the fans were left with a cliffhanger. A year later when this film was released we were hoping that the cliffhanger would be resolved but it wasn't. Instead we get the last week of Laura life and we slowly see her life was a nightmare. We see her demise of not only physical but also spiritual. A life so out of control tragedy was sure to come.Keep in mind this is an R RATED film. This is not a feature length television episode. The ugly side of life was only hinted at in the television show. In this film we see the ""Ugly Truth"" The film might not be for everyone but it is one of the best films of 1992. The plot the film is that the folksy town of Deerfield, Wash., FBI Agent Desmond (Chris Isaak) inexplicably disappears while hunting for the man who murdered a teen girl. The killer is never apprehended, and, after experiencing dark visions and supernatural encounters, Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) chillingly predicts that the culprit will claim another life. Meanwhile, in the similarly cozy town of Twin Peaks, hedonistic beauty Lara Palmer (Sheryl Lee) seems destined for a grisly fate.Please watch this after you have seen the entire television show. this is a prequel!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
182,Silentsleep,A solid offering from a creative genius,6,5 August 2019,"Massive Lynch fan and have been looking forward to watching FWWM for quite some time. If you're a Lynch or twin peaks fan this is definitely worth watching. The terrible reviews following this after its initial release are wrong - however I don't agree with some recent assessment of FWWM as one of Lynch's masterpieces. Yes, all of the surreal weirdness is there and the opening 20 minutes is a great example of this. However, in a way the problem is not that it was too weird but that it was not weird enough - as a movie it's too constrained and tied to the essential plot points which match it up with the brilliant twin peaks. This forces a narrative arc that is more TV-like preventing the movie from truly expanding into what it is. In this sense it's a reverse of Mulholland Drive which was supposed to be a TV series but was turned into a movie - this is a movie that still feels too much like a missed TV season. Perhaps this is why the opening scene is of a TV set being destroyed.It's definitely one of Lynch's darkest works and contains more explicit detail than is common in his other films. Perhaps my mind might change on FWWM when I watch the Twin Peaks: The Return however.A solid film from one of my favourite directors - not a flop, but not an unsung work of genius. Worth watching, though.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Curious as I am, I want to know what happened in little town twin-peaks. It puzzles me, I can't figure it out. Every time I think I know what exactly happened, I come up with more questions. The whole story is so full of fear you can't seem to catch. That's what I think is so great about Lynch. He tries to tell you something, but doesn't tell what it is. The scene, Bob is in the mirror in the car when the car is at the traffic-lights next to the one armed-man. The scene when Laura comes home and finds her dad to be Bob. It's creepy. I love it.

184,apauLLo,"The badder, the better!",9,30 August 2015,"★★★★☆ 4.5 out of 5 stars. Like most of Lynch's brilliant, often genre- defining films that raise the bar for inspiring film-makers, TPFWWM gets better with repeated viewings. So multi-layered with so many lines to read between, not like most of the near-brainless popcorn crap that sadly most audiences love to flock to, this has become a real cult gem in 24 years. In 1992 Cannes festival-goers booed it, and I was particularly intrigued how it was once brazenly marketed with Siskel & Ebert's famous ""TWO THUMBS DOWN!"" in letters on a poster larger than the title itself. FWWM was never designed to appeal to the masses - par for David Lynch and par for me. Sheryl Lee's performance is superb, and the newly available 90 minutes of deleted scenes on Blu-ray enforce this performance, ESPECIALLY Bob's possession sequence with Laura's slowing widening toothy smile - one of THE downright creepiest cinematic scenes you will ever see. 9/10",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

But it is, undoubtedly, one of Lynch's cruellest, darkest and most brilliantly affecting neighbourhood visions. Even if it managed to displease diehard fans of the series. Lynch had refused the obvious: the movie did not pick up where the series had left off (the cliffhanger ending of Bob's triumph over Special Agent Dale Cooper), nor did it simply reprise the sub plots, humour and folksly catch-phrases that hade made the television show so popular. Instead, the film elects to go back to a hidden past - the last few days of Laura Palmer's life - for a brilliant but excoriating account of incest, abuse and brutality, exposing the very heart of the TV series.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
186,qrter,A Character Study of Laura Palmer,9,13 July 2003,"I see this film as an excellent psychological character study of Laura Palmer during the last week of her sad life, Lynch style. This means that it can and does go beyond simply stating facts - it also leaves room for the visualization of moods and perceptions. I have sadly only seen the first series of Twin Peaks (which I loved) and I can see how some TP-fans miss the humour of the show - however, Laura's life is just such a sad affair, full of fear. Kind of hard and forced even to pump lots of laughs into this. To me it is also logical Lynch would choose Laura as his subject matter for this film - the whole series revolves around her. And ofcourse Lynch doesn't pull any punches - he takes us into the deep. The first part centering around Teresa Banks was pretty good, on its own, although the connection to Twin Peaks does not go very deep. However, the trademark humour is in this part of the film.. I also felt they should've left Cooper out, until the end (in the lodge with Laura Palmer). His part did almost nothing for the film now (also because McLachlan could only be on set for 6 days, I understand).Two parts were missing that would connect this film better to the series - firstly, the absence of Audrey (I know, Sherilyn Fenn was doing Jennifer Lynch's ""Boxing Helena"" at the time). Even though she wasn't very close with Laura, her part is pretty big in the series, so I would've liked to see her in this. A real omission imo is the absence of the psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby - I don't know how that storyline evolves in the 2nd series, but seeing as Laura was making ""dubious"" tapes for the doctor and seeing the doctors obsession with her, I felt their relationship should've been explained more.In the end the film left me with the sentence ""poor, poor Laura"" repeating in my head. I believe it to be an excellent, stylized representation of the psychological chaos in her head, her emotional life torn to tatters.Finally, this is also the most scary of Lynch's work, in my opinion. Many a moment that shocked my socks off.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
187,Splet,Primordial Jung-le,10,23 February 2003,"David Lynch's main goal as an artist seems to be creating the ultimate,resonating archetype of evil itself,its inner dynamics,from the stores of his own unconscious.This film pulls all the stops on that process,leaving the viewer with only one decision:did that mirror or tweak even the most race-memory levels of my unconscious dream-life?If not,you're probably never going to enjoy a David Lynch film.

Personally, i watched it right after seeing Twin Peaks and while it may have many flaws, it does a pretty decent job explaining many things that the series couldn't/didn't wanted to. I think the main reason is the ""disjointed"" nature of the movie. The first half may have almost nothing to do with the second part (or with the original series actually), but it is in no way a boring movie.I think that, if you can ignore the fact that, some actors are not the originals, and that the first half of the movie is kind of obscure and far fetched, (I mean, you're watching Lynch's material after all) it's a very enjoyable and well done movie which will clarify and fill a lot of gaps.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

Let me start by saying everything that happens in Twin Peaks from the series to the movie all makes perfect sense. This is something which needs to be viewed carefully, and thought about very clearly. I'm not going to tell you what I think it's all about but I'm pretty damn sure I know, and I know well enough to say this makes perfect sense. I will also say if you have not seen the television show Twin Peaks (season 1&2) don't even bother with this movie.

I enjoyed this movie because I had already developed a relationship with both, and after finishing the entire Twin Peaks series I still wanted more. Fire Walk With Me is not as good as the TV show, but instead serves as a supplement, or dare I say, a fan video. I don't believe it works as a stand-alone film. For that, I would recommend instead watching the full pilot of the TV show, as it was made to work as a movie if the series didn't get picked up. Or better yet, watch the whole series, then the movie will seem good. I honestly don't know why Fire Walk With Me isn't better. There was so much to work with from the series.

But as a stand alone film, David Lynch has constructed a brilliant, haunting portrait of a family ripping apart at the seams, and a look at an sickening underworld in small town USA.  Laura Palmer - all American girl, prom queen, drug addict, victim of incest - became a household name with her televised death in 1991.  In the film version, Lynch shows us the troubled events leading up to her death/murder.Once again, Lynch leaves the viewer reeling with his stunning visuals.  He is a true artist.  Who else on the planet could show a simple streetlight wavering in the wind and have it evoke so many different emotions - fear, sadness, anticipation.

Lynch really showed us what he meant when he said that he wanted to add movement and sound to his paintings and pictures when he was first a painter. His shots are true living paintings and the visual pleasure I feel every time I watch it is always bigger.Moreover, actress Sheryl Lee, playing Laura Palmer, is literally possessed by her character. It is incredible the way she makes us believe that this is reality. She makes us laugh, cry, scares us and was able to make the character of Laura so likeable.

I was astonished to discover that further to the thrilling emotions it aroused in me, that vicious, abstract, Gothic, atmosphere aroused in me also strong sexual vibrations. I am used to watching thrilling movies and going to sleep soon after. But with this movie, both times, I couldn't get asleep since it caused me a complete awakening of mind and senses. David Lynch is really extraordinary. Everything makes sense in the architecture of this movie (characters, sound track, scenes, décors and any details) although nothing is supposed to have really sense.

197,andreashalskov,Murder Case Turned Eerily Kafkaesque,8,11 July 2006,"If the words above could be used to describe another Lynch movie - the much applauded ""Lost Highway"" (1997) whose plot is inspired in part by Kafka's ""Die Verwandlung"" and the well-known O.J. Simpson-case - they are as much descriptive of his earlier and less critically acclaimed film ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" (1992).After two fascinating intermezzos (namely ""Industrial Symphony No. 1"" [1990] and ""Wild at Heart"" [1991]) David Lynch returns to the ever more surreal and absurd mystery of ""Twin Peaks"" (1990-1991) together with writer Robert Engels. While the TV-series opened to rave reviews and much acclaim, audience interest dwindled and critics grew tired during the much debated second season. Leaving no finite answers as to mystery of Laura Palmer's murder-case, the series went as far as to finish with a question - in fact, a strangely diabolical one: ""How's Annie...?"" There are perhaps no definite answers either in the prequel ""Fire Walk With Me"", however the subjective story of Laura's Persephony-like descent into Hades remains as tantalizing and surreal as ever - at once more impressive and more horrific than that of John Merrick in Lynch's 1980 classic ""The Elephant Man"". To be true, the story of Laura's dire straits even resembles that of Fred Madison in aforementioned ""Lost Highway"". And there will never be an ending quite as persuasive - though explicitly violent and misogonistic - as when Laura's strangely picturesque thrashing is underscored by the classical masterpiece ""Requiem in C Minor"". - A final scene not without a certain likeness to the visually explicit misogyny in ""Blue Velvet"" (1986) where strongly saturated close-ups of Dorothy Valens' bloody teeth make for a scarily scoptofiliac and visceral experience.Two scenes in particular from ""Fire Walk With Me"" deserve mentioning as perhaps two of Lynch's most explicitly and vividly subjective sequences ever: (1) - an almost (andobviously intentionally so) unintelligible scene in a filthy bar near the American-Canadian border where Jacques Renault apparently (though never audible to 'us') gives hints as to the murder of Teresa Banks.and, (2) - an excessively loud, noisy scene where Laura and Leland, both seated in Leland's car, are held back in traffic by a timber truck and an old handicapped couple. The eerie tone slowly turns deafening before erupting in a violent (almost abrasive) musique concrète - mirroring the abuse of Laura and the (beautiful?) absurdity of life in an almost Epsteinian fashion.The film has so often ""fallen victim"" to misreadings and critical devaluation, but in its uncanny and eerily surreal stimmung it should, instead, be recognised as the very essence of Lynchian. Demanding as it may seem, ""Fire Walk With Me"" is meant to be experienced and felt, as much as it is meant to be intellectually understood.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

They only sound jumbled, confusing and morbid, and though those are words synonymous with the incredible writer/director/producer, they miss the point. David Lynch isn't the kind of filmmaker who produces a point A to point B story. He is an abstract artist painting a picture of the human condition. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me may be a depiction of the final days of Laura Palmer and a last hurrah for a beloved series, but at its heart, it's a portrait of an abused and very deeply disturbed woman. I watched this movie without having ever seen the series, and I have to admit the first time took me aback with the film's shocking and often abrasive imagery as well as it's... unique... dialog, which can at times seem over-the-top or even corny, but after the second, third, and eventually fourth viewings, the film became a world unto itself filled with both beautiful and disturbing scenes accompanied by creative dialog that accentuates the condition of each character. Don't see this movie with expectations in comparison to the series (which this film inspired me to watch) and don't see this movie casual pop-corn thriller.

201,mertoncarter,It was always going to be fascinating,8,18 September 2003,"Well, in the cool light of day 11 years later, it is clear that Fire Walk With Me was always going to split fans of the original TV series of Twin Peaks. Lynch clearly delights in showing and doing what he couldn't on network TV and has Laura Palmer snorting cocaine, swearing and baring her breasts in equal measure. The plot is coherent enough for fans of the series but will probably alienate those unfamiliar with Agent Cooper, Bobby Briggs and the like. Even die hard fans may find the sometimes shocking and always unusual imagery a little hard to stomach. Characters come and go - David Bowie utters one line, while series regulars like Peggy Lipton and Madchen Amick are given very little to do. Still, it is a fascinating coda to the series and moments are unforgettable - the angel, the dwarf, the white horse... it's all here, as inexplicable as ever. Sheryl Lee is fabulous as Laura Palmer, the photography is gorgeous and the soundtrack was the rightful winner of numerous awards that year. It certainly doesn't deserve the panning it got then, although Lynch's more recent work, namely Mulholland Dr., is arguably finer still. Entertaining and disturbing, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me is an experience for Peaks and Lynch fans alike, as well as those who are willing to watch just for the experience.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
202,halkatla,A really interesting and enjoyable film,10,28 November 2002,"I suppose that the best way to enjoy this film is to have watched the tv show and and fallen in love with it and the memory of Laura Palmer. I waited for this movie for years and then when I first saw it (I was  14 I think) I was very disappointed. But I taped it and watched it again a couple of years later and found it absolutely fantastic. It´s strange and wonderful and really gets a hold on you, just like the show. I guess it´s Laura, her destiny was so sad and yet she was such a strong character even when dead. Anyway, don´t watch it unless you´ve seen the shows, it´s all connected. Best of all is to get really obsessed and delve into all the mystery stuff. Enjoy :)I gave it a 10 since it´s one of the most enjoyable films I´ve ever seen. I like David Lynch and his surrealism and dream madness.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
203,smurfsatemydeadfetus,One of a Kind,9,22 March 2006,"I LOVED this movie! There really aren't very many movies out there that are weird and mysterious in the way Twin Peaks was. It always left you with the element of surprise. And quite frankly, i like the fact that you really don't know whats going on until the end of the movie. A lot of movies you don't even really have to pay attention to, and you still know whats going on, where this movie you basically have to be GLUED to, or else you're lost. David Lynch is a genius! This movie, Blue Velvet, and Mullholland Drive are masterpieces! I think more movie makers should take a note or two from Lynch. This is definitely going to be scored in my top 10 of favorite movies. Its just brilliant, and unlike anything I've ever seen. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and....well just weird things.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
204,cbrimhall08,Terrible crazy movie.,1,28 January 2013,"I'm sorry but this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I know that within the film industry originality and alternative approaches to telling stories are usually praised but this movie is a waste of time. I've seen some other David Lynch movies, and there are a few I like, particularly Lost Highway. But not only does this movie not make sense, it is boring and very dry. Inland Empire was at least crazy enough to keep you watching but this movie starts out for 30 minutes as an FBI investigation and then the remainder of the film is about a high school student. The story never comes back to the FBI investigation or the first missing girl. In all, I just feel that this movie was trying too hard to be hipster and out there. It failed miserably in my book.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
205,treelzebub,A Few Things For the Cofused,10,11 May 2005,"I just watched FWWM for probably the 10th time, after having just watched the series again, and I realized that each time I come away with a bigger and bigger picture. I have never thought of the Twin Peaks saga as having a conclusive ""answer,"" and I think that's an important basic framework within which to view both the series and the film. The series has obvious inconsistencies, by virtue of its being a television show, and subject to revision and the different styles of all involved. By the same token, the film has its quirks, including Laura Flynn Boyle's replacement by Moira Kelly, and the fact that it was condensed from almost three times the final length.Regardless, I noticed a few things in this viewing of the film that I hadn't before. When Mrs. Palmer is shown in bed and she sees the horse, I always thought of it as just a weird David Lynch moment that we are not meant to understand. We must remember, though, that she is under the influence of whatever drug Leland gives her to make her sleep while he (under BOB's control) terrorizes Laura. Also, we learn early on in the series that Sarah has frequent visions/hallucinations. The significance of the white horse could be a biblical connection, a sign of a coming apocalypse of sorts (ie, Laura's murder). I find this idea interesting, as it brings in not only ideas of fire, but also the later use of angels.Laura mentions angels in her response to Donna's question about falling in space. She says that they will not help you as you fall faster and faster, bursting into flames. Near the end, Laura spirals further and further out of control, and in the train car the angel comes to Ronnette's aid, but not to hers. Once in the Black Lodge with Agt. Cooper (the ""good Dale"" that Annie speaks of), another angel appears, and Laura cries tears of joy, perhaps realizing that she was mistaken, and that in death she had been saved from Bob's clutches. The strange thing, of course, is that this all happens well before the point (in Season 2) where Cooper becomes trapped in the Lodge. Metaphysical places, however, are not necessarily bound by space-time.Other problems or confusing areas also arose this time around. First of all, in the scene where we witness Bob revealed as Leland, Laura is supposed to be asleep. This is rather hard to believe, as we see her snort three giant lines of cocaine right before this happens. Also, I find it strange that Bobby was never held accountable for the murder he commits (the victim of which is obviously not Mike, as he is alive and well in the series; is it not the sheriff's deputy from the beginning?). This part seems tacked on and out of place, but maybe next time it will make more sense.These are just some of the things I noticed, and I wanted to share them with anyone who feels frustrated by the movie. It has a very different feel from the series, to be sure, but I don't think it is so detached that it should be dismissed. For Lynch fans, and for fans of the series, there is still much food for thought, and interesting connections to be made.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
206,s103505715,"Surreal, perplexing and highly underrated",10,24 October 2005,"As a pretty big Lynch and Twin Peaks fan I suppose it's no surprise that I thought this was one of the most wonderful films I've ever seen. Memorable imagery, genuine scares and enough bizarre happenings to render the film eminently re-watchable. Lynch's distinctive style is very evident and it's safe to assume if you enjoy films such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive (or perhaps are a fan or surrealists like Jodorowsky and Bunuel) you'll enjoy this film. Word of warning - it helps to watch the TV series in it's entirety before watching this. It'd be time well spent. My friends and I got through the full 30 episodes and feature film and it's safe to say we emerged has major fans. Perhaps not to everyone's tastes but for those who are tired of the linear and obvious films mass produced by Hollywood it's a welcome change like all Lynch's work.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
207,jennerlaskny,very underrated,8,1 May 2015,"yes, it's not as good as the TV show, but if you judge it on it's own merits, then the film is great. I mean, compare it to Any other movie in this genre, and you can tell it's still way better then most. Now with the deleted scenes, we can see what happened to all out favorite characters, so even if you are a slave to the TV show, this film still has merit, since U an see what happened to our favorite characters :) As a first time viewer, I would be more optimistic to watching this film, then the TV show reboot that doesn't have David Lynch involved. This show is his baby, and we were lucky enough that he shared this show with us. I have no interest in watching a new show with someone's else's interpretation of what they think David Lynch would do.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
208,ash-kong,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992),7,22 November 2016,"It's almost impossible to know where to begin with a review for this film. From the very beginning, director David Lynch lets the viewer know that this is not just a two-hour-and-fifteen-minute episode of the cult classic television show (that he and writer Mark Frost created) put on film and released to theaters. However, this film serves as both a prequel and a sequel (of sorts) to the T.V. show.The basic summary of the plot is that this film is essentially a eulogy to one of the television's central characters: Laura Palmer (of which we saw precious little of in the actual show) and an exploration of her last seven days in this mortal coil. The film depicts her many struggles; these include her drug abuse, her sexual promiscuity, her struggle with maintaining innocence within her dark lifestyle, and her crumbling relationships with her best friend Donna Heyward, her football-hero-boyfriend Bobby Briggs, and the true love of her life, James Hurley.The film also explores her strained relationship with her father (who, if the viewer has watched the t.v. show will know, brings upon the untimely demise of his own daughter) and her having to cope with the struggles of living at home with a psychotic molester. In addition, the film explores the mythology created in the t.v. show surrounding Bob (The evil spirit that possesses Laura's father) and the Red Room/Black Lodge(where Bob and other strange entities roam in a zigzag patterned room surrounded by red curtains and sparse furniture). What is most amazing of about the film is how it dove-tails many minor characters from the show and most of the clues that were given about Laura Palmer's murder and weaves them almost seamlessly into the plot. The prologue details the murder of Teresa Banks (only mentioned on the t.v. show) and how the investigation a year prior to Laura's own murder ties in with the show and plot of this film. Such attention to detail pays off and really bring characters like Ronette Palaski (the lady wondering aimlessly in the pilot episode) to light with a certain appreciation that wasn't there before (There is a tear-jerking scene towards the end that shows Ronette as an angel, symbolizing that she will be the one who will help to bring Laura's murderer to justice) Another aspect of the film that fans will sure to appreciate is how the film transports a few bits of the second season (after Laura's murderer had been revealed) and sort of goes back-and-forth in time and gives an illusion, if not a definite answer, to where the new show (coming in 2017) may go.The film is a bit of challenge to watch, but in a way that was strikingly similar to the first viewing of his masterpiece ""Blue Velvet"". The first time watching any of Lynch's films will put the viewer through a state of utter bewilderment after viewing. Often times, one is left wondering what they watched, or if they had watched anything at all, and not just imagined it. Personally, I rather liked the film (though I wouldn't say it was quite as brilliant as ""Blue Velvet""), and found it to be a great addition to the ""Twin Peaks"" mythology. However, the film did have its flaws. While it is understandable that Lynch wanted to set this film apart in a way from the series as far as graphic content (such as nudity and violence), it doesn't feel completely necessary and therefore takes away a bit of the story's intentions rather than adds to the effect. Another is that some scenes feel longer than they should be and scenes that should've been longer are too short for the impact they were going for. (The unevenness may have mostly to do with the fact that the film was cut down from nearly four hours!)It was very ambitious for Lynch to set out and make this film, tackling so many themes (the angst of teenage years, the loss of innocence in a picturesque town, time-travel between two worlds) as well as trying to please both fans of the show and newcomers to the world of Twin Peaks. And while, for Peaks fans, the film may disappoint on some level for not having all of the characters from the t.v. show (Sheriff Truman, Deputy Andy and ""Hawk"", Audrey Horne, etc.), it is commendable on Lynch's part that he did not just try to shoe-horn everyone's favorite characters from the show at the risk of corrupting the overall themes of the film. Therefore, Lynch deserves some credit, as he nearly hits home with all that sets out to accomplish. Overall, this is a well-done film with Lynch at his darkest (with some of the themes and imagery being a bit of a throwback to the director's earlier films, especially ""The Grandmother""). The acting is great all around (especially Sheryl Lee as Laura Palmer and Chris Isaak as Agent Chester Desmond-a character created specifically for the film), the soundtrack is wonderful and the lighting/cinema photography is excellent as per usual of a Lynch film. However, this film is not for all tastes and it is recommended to see the show first and then to watch the film, which undoubtedly brings more resonance to the proceedings.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
209,wileycmm-36355,"A Dark, Beautiful, and Engaging Piece of Art",9,10 July 2018,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me 
ReviewBeing a massive fan of the show, I was worried when I saw all of the negativity surrounding this film. I decided to see it anyways, and I'm glad I did.Fire Walk With Me focuses mainly on Laura Palmer leading up to her death. Sheryl Lee provides us with a fantastic performance. While some other familiar faces from the show appear in the film, they all have brief roles. The main focus is Laura. The film depicts Laura at the climax of her downward spiral, fueled by sex, drugs, and fear. The movie (apart from the first 30 minutes) is engaging and beautiful. It's significantly darker than its television counterpart. But that's because it focuses on darker subject matter and doesn't get caught up in all of the side plots like the show does. The darkness in the film is depicted beautifully; utilizing dream sequences, intense imagery, and beautiful shots. The euphoric dreamlike quality that is present in most lynch films is expressed beautifully here.Despite the lackluster opening, I can't praise the core of this film enough. It's different than anything Twin Peaks has offered. And is truly an individual work of art. Don't believe the negativity heaped on this film by critics. Make your own judgments, it will be well worth your time. 9/10",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
210,Reeler,Not really Twin Peaks,3,5 July 2007,"It would have been better to film this with no Twin Peaks connection. Its vibe is too different to that of the series. Much of what made the show was the feeling of evil beneath the exterior of the peaceful little town. This movie doesn't get that. There's no sense of place at all. It's more a pale & fragmented imitation than a fully realized story. It's surprising that Lynch made it himself. It suffers from flat photography, awkwardly staged scenes, and amateurish acting. Despite the budget estimate on this site, it looks like it equaled whatever pocket change Lynch had on him at the time. The series was fantastic. I really wanted to like this movie, but it isn't much more than twisted and quirky for its own sake. For aficionados only, and not even for all of them.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me

213,hendrixpm,Absolutely gorgeous film in all regards!,10,10 July 2009,"Fire Walk With Me holds a bizarre place in the halls of the Twin Peaks cannon--for some it is terrible, unclear, and the tone veers too much from that of the series. However, for myself, I found Fire Walk With Me to be the most rewarding and satisfying of Lynch's films.It is tempting to approach the movie with analytical feelers, intellectualizing certain abstract images and sounds into concrete plot points. For some I'm sure this works, but it also threatens to minimize the impact of the images and sounds. This is a film that you have to surrender yourself to--you have to have decent volume on a clear system, with an immersive picture. You have to trap yourself in the film. If you do, the rewards are glorious--some of Lynch's most beautiful, soul-stirring images, sounds that summon great swells of emotion within, and performances that create characters so complete and so tragic that you cannot help but connect with them.Sure this review may sound like one of a fanatic fan, and indeed it may just be--but you owe it to yourself to live in the world of Twin Peaks one last time in Fire Walk With Me. Don't let the negative reviews deter you from seeing the triumph that is the artistry of this film.

The only thing that really bothers me is that it wasn't Lara Flynn Boyle that played the part of Donna Hayward... I don't know why but I find these things quite irritating, especially since all the rest of the cast was original from the series. I'm not aware of what kept Lara away from the part as Donna, if it was due to scheduling conflicts or the nude scenes i do not know but I'm sure she had her reasons. Not that Moira Kelly did any thing wrong, she is a very good actress and really captured all of Donnas features but she is not Lara Flynn Boyle, otherwise I liked it very much. Just as weird and mystical as the series, complete with the same eiry felling. In my opinion the soundtrack is one of the key elements of Twin Peaks, the music by Angelo Badalamenti really made both the movie and the TV-series.

216,mailpail666,Weird does NOT equal good!,2,14 April 2009,"It is funny how woefully unpopular this TV show and movie were, and how the very few that actually watched it and liked it assume that means it was some vast conspiracy against great art. I just watched seasons 1 and 2 on DVD (not one to judge until I've actually watched the whole thing), and Lynch and Frost talked about how they worked on other things during season 2 (when it finally started getting semi-watchable), then they came back to end season 2 the right way, and set up season 3 (even though they didn't believe it was going to happen). And the last few episodes were the weirdest and most incoherent bits of ""artistic"" vomit that has ever been allowed on the small screen. Yuck! Then fans come on IMDb and whine about how the studio and media conspiracy forced everyone to not go to the movie and forced them not to watch the TV show because they refused to support such artistic genius. Of course, it could never have been because the show was actually bad, and that is why the show wasn't watched and the movie did pathetic box office. That said, if you want some creepy-weird sex scenes between Laura, a crew-member-made-actor, and Laura's dad - well, then this is your kind of movie!

Understood The Matrix perfectly the first time. But this one, not at all.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you liked the show or was a fan of whomever wrote or directed this. Maybe if you were into psychology and wanted to get a look into a very disturbed mind.I honestly wonder if everyone who gave this a good rating are fans of morbidly disturbed films.Maybe if I watched the series or had a inkling of what the film was about I might of had some appreciation for it. But I don't want to know anything about a film before I watch it, too many times the details give too much away. For example Sixth Sense, if you knew the ending it wasn't nearly as good.Anyways, my first review here. I actually had to come here and read other reviews trying to figure out what the heck I missed.

218,ziegler_larry,"I liked the series, but...",2,4 March 2002,"Okay, I went into this movie (first time viewing with the DVD) very hopeful, and excited - because I've seen the first season on DVD and really liked it. I thought that it would be cool to see the events leading up to the pilot...And the first half of the movie was cool, I loved Chris Isaak and Keifer Sutherland - both did a great job of being quirky FBI agents.  And when Kyle MacLachlin comes into the picture, with his dreams and the David Bowie appearance - it all was very cool.Then we go back to Twin Peaks, and start seeing how sick and twisted Laura's life was, and some back story is revealed.  Still good.Then we get to what I can only describe as the ""sex scene in the Canadian cabin"" and the movie dove straight into a disused outhouse.  The movie stopped dead - beating me mercilessly with the sexual depravity of Laura, the drugs, the... everything.  And it kept going on, and on, and on. During which, a lot of bland exposition is spewed out of every character, and it's all subtitled (even though the dialogue is clear as day).Anyway, after that scene, I felt removed from the whole thing, and the remainder of the movie felt lifeless - I didn't care about it anymore.  I stopped the movie with about 20 minutes left - that's how disinterested I was.Many people really like this flick, but I'm sorry that I do not.

221,comedywyvern,"An overall disappointment,...but recommended for fans of the series",4,14 July 2010,"In a town like Twin Peaks no one is innocent. And to anyone who's never seen the influential David Lynch series, no part of this movie is comprehensible. David Lynch's movies never exactly have a demographic and usually in his films, much like the author Franz Kafka - when you allow yourself to fall into his bizarre world, eventually you are delighted to have no idea what is going on. Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire and even the critically panned Lost Highway share this Lynchian quality and all have the potential to appeal to a broader audience. Fire Walk With Me however is one notable exception as to the uninitiated to Twin Peaks, this movie means little to nothing I have never understood why Lynch took the decision to make this movie a prequel rather than continue the story that was so cruelly brought to an end in 1991 when the TV series was cancelled. Continuing on from where he left of could've potentially relaunched ""Peaksmania"" and given Dale Cooper and Co. a new life.The resultant movie is a complicated, multi layered horror story which features many of the main cast (with some of the regulars either busy on other projects or cut out of the movie altogether), and at the same time introducing a whole host of new characters to the story to make this even more disappointing. In fact, the first 40 minutes of the movie doesn't actually take place in Twin Peaks but on the road and in the offices of Pennsylvania, with the hero Dale Cooper clocking up less than 15 minutes screen time in the entire movie.Not to dwell on the negatives, Lynch does dedicate more time, explaining the ambiance and utter horror of the Black Lodge. It is great to finally see exactly what happened to the delightful but anything-but innocent Laura Palmer in the final seven days before her death. However, a continuation of the series would've been the logical move before exploring the back story.For fans of the series this movie will certainly come as some comfort for the abrupt ending of the television series, but for the full effect this movie must not be watched before the series Over all Fire Walk With Me, though at times attempts to tie up some loose ends, fails and frankly the less questions asked: the better",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
222,alexrank316,Despite the lack of appearances from 'TP' favourites this film stands on it's own two legs as a stunner.,10,9 March 2004,"Many fans of the series were disappointed by Lynch's big screen prequel to Twin Peaks but not without good reason, all the time you could have been watching Dale Cooper, Dr Jacoby, Pete Martell, Audrey Horne, Sheriff Truman etc. We were instead looking at Chris Isaak and Keifer Sutherland for roughly the first half hour. However, people need to be aware when watching this that it is an account of the demise of Laura Palmer and circumstances that circled her fate not a history of the town 'Twin Peaks'. For this reason I feel the Teresa Banks mystery to be a great start that really sets off the mood for what becomes one of the greatest, most atmospheric, melancholy and truly scary experiences in cinema history. Shock-Horror films will never capture the same intensity and fear that I witnessed while watching Laura Palmer's life fall apart. What I found most outstanding about this movie though (SPOILER WARNING!)... was how Lynch symbolised the psychological effects of sexual abuse, child abuse, drug abuse etc. No film I have ever watched has ever touched on issues like this in such a eerie and unsettling yet beautiful and romantic way and the ability to successfully turn an ordinary murder mystery into such an epic weave of emotions and surreal environments what appears to be demonic intervention is why I see him as the most truly gifted director of all time.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
223,StevenRosburg,Pathetic,3,4 June 2003,"I liked the TV series ""Twin Peaks"", because it was strange, yet charming and humorous. However, this made-for-video movie is dark, even more bizarre and just plain depressing. The beginning has some of the original strange humor, but when it moves forward to the main theme revolving around the life of Laura Palmer, it just goes loses it for me. The whole time I kept fighting the urge to just turn it off. Unlike the TV series, this movie didn't even try to be clean; on the contrary, it seemed like just an excuse for debauchery. If you want to see Laura Palmer snort coke and show her tits repeatedly, that's pretty much all this movie is good for. The one thing I liked was getting to find out who killed her at the end, since it brought closure to the mystery.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
224,TheMattmatic,A great series turned into a mess of a film,7,19 July 2013,"David Lynch is a visionary director - following his vision, he's created masterpieces like Mulholland Drive. He's also behind Dune, a terrible film, although this was a much the studios fault as his own. Fire walk with me, however, is also terrible - and here there's no one to blame but the man himself. This is Lynch out of control.Twin Peaks - the TV series is brilliant, but uneven. The show balances so many ingredients - a murder mystery, surrealism with supernatural overtones, soap opera clichés, parodies of soap opera clichés, romance, and absurd comedy. The pilot is an absolute masterpiece, and the first season is one of the best things ever shown on television. The second season opens with a killer Lynch-directed episode. The second season continues fairly strong, then loses its focus completely midway, and finally gets a little bit better towards the end. By the last episode Frost and Lynch had returned after leaving the helm of the ship for awhile, frustrated by ABC forcing them to make decisions they didn't believe was in the best interest of the show. The drop in quality mid season 2 wasn't their fault - for more info on this, watch the excellent ""Making of Twin Peaks"" documentary. By the end of season two Frost and Lynch knew the show would probably get cancelled and Lynch decided to go out with a bang - a very Lynchian bang. The last episode is complete surreal weirdness - a path that the Twin Peaks movie continues its fiery walk on. The balance of all the different elements, Mark Frost being the levelheaded scriptwriting pro to Lynch's surrealist auteur, is now replaced with Lynch following his every hunch and throwing the idea of having a traditional narrative out the window. However, TP:FWWM is far, far less entertaining as a whole than the last episode of the TV show.I'd only recommend Twin Peaks:Fire walk with me if you've seen the entire Twin Peaks series. And even so, you can just as well skip it. It doesn't add to the enjoyment of the show, and is mostly for completists. The film does have a few great surreal dream sequences, where you can sense the magic touch Lynch can have when he's in the zone. But the film has several problems that even his feel for mood, cinematography and sound design can't solve.First of all, the film lacks an overarching narrative - something even the surreal Lynch films Eraserhead, Lost Highway and Mullholland Drive had (more or less). What's it ABOUT? Well, the film is split into two parts, and they have almost nothing to do with one another. The first part revolves around FBI agents and the murder of a girl killed by the murderer of Laura Palmer a year earlier. The second part - which makes up most of the film - is the part set in Twin Peaks showing the last days of Laura Palmer. However, this is the polar opposite of what made the beginning of the TV series so compelling. The TV show started with a mystery and had a plot that slowly revealed more and more, keeping the viewer hooked. If you've seen the show you won't find a lot here you didn't already know - the mystery is already revealed, it just feels like a tedious waiting game. And if you see this film without having seen the show, you'll just be confused and feel alienated. In both cases you'll be left wondering: why was this film made?Another problem is replacing Lara Flynn Boyle with Moira Kelly - it probably would have been wiser removing Donna Hayward from the plot altogether. A lot of sets are also noticeably different from how the TV series looks. The exterior shots in sunlight, the streets, the houses, Shelly and Leo's place, Harold Smiths room - the don't look like they did in the TV show. All this affects how you view the film coming from seeing the show - you don't feel like you're in Twin Peaks. This actually ruins some of the magic of both this film AND the series. It ruins the illusion and the feeling of Twin Peaks being a real place.And the feel of Twin Peaks is, as mentioned, gone. The movie is very dark and takes itself very seriously, often crossing the line towards being pretentious. There's very little comedy and parody to lighten the mood. Scenes are either completely cliché (most of the actors do a good or decent job delivering the completely uninteresting dialogue) or Lynch being weird for weirdness' sake. Watch the second episode of the show - it's directed by Lynch and perfection from beginning to end. The surrealism doesn't feel forced, it seems to flow naturally and furthers the story - not the case here.I felt compelled to write this review since a lot of the reviews of TP:FWWM on IMDb are either rave reviews by Lynch fans who love everything he's done, or people who don't like Lynch or who haven't even seen the Twin Peaks series bashing the film. Well, I'm here to give my two cents - the middle ground. I love Twin Peaks and I'm a huge fan of Lynch's style when it works (like in Mulholland Drive) - but Fire walk with me doesn't cut it. It's the only Lynch film that I feel is a waste of time seeing - if there is a ""puzzle"" here to solve, I don't feel like solving it. I'd rather hold on to the feeling the TV show gave me, and maintain the mysterious feel around who Laura Palmer was when she was alive.David Lynch's son does look cool with that bird mask on though. I'll give him that.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
225,joshhelmuth,Worst movie I ever seen,1,7 June 2006,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I feel horrible knowing that I have now wasted 2 hours of my life watching this dreadful thing that they call a movie. There should be a label on the movie cover warning people that they may want to stab themselves after watching this film. I love movies, and I have seen a lot of them, including many that are simply not good, but this movie blows my mind. Just when I thought I had seen enough, the director proved me wrong. There is no clear plot, the acting is horrible, and the imagery is the quality that of a cheap porno. If i could rate this movie less than a '1' I would.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
226,hairycow1,Pretty good.... but we still don't know how Annie's doing,7,19 January 2015,"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a lot like how you might expect a Twin Peaks movie to be. It's strange, compelling, and written well. It is a solid movie that is definitely worth watching, especially for fans of the show, but I certainly have my fair share of gripes with it.The reason I fell in love with Twin Peaks from the start was because, even after just one episode, Laura Palmer was one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen. The way that David Lynch romanticized death in the form of Laura Palmer was fascinating. It sucked me in and wouldn't let go. So a movie about the week leading up to Laura's death would be great, right? Well, not exactly. My main problem with Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me was that it accomplished basically nothing. Yes, Laura Palmer is one of my all time favorite fictional characters, and yes, it was great to see exactly how she was murdered. However, we knew most of what had happened already. The movie felt largely like a visualization of events that we, the viewer, already knew the conclusion to. Because of this, it lacked the suspense and tension that the series had. Not only that, but Lynch focused solely on adding details to a story we know, rather than continuing the story that ended so abruptly. I can't help but question the decision behind this. This movie was also weird purely for the sake of being weird, even more so than the TV show. In the show, the scenes from The Black Lodge were my favorite. They were strange, but not too strange and seemed to at least have some symbolic meaning to them. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me tried to replicate the success that the show had, but failed in my opinion. I mean, honestly, what was the purpose of David Bowie's character? What about the kid with mask? The ring? Who knows? Not me, that's for sure. Truly understanding most of these messages basically requires a frame by frame breakdown of the movie. I shouldn't have to look up what happened in a movie to actually understand what was going on. *cough* Donnie Darko *cough*With those issues out of the way, I'll focus more on the things I actually liked about the movie. There is a lot to enjoy about the movie. While I did complain that the movie was basically a play- by-play of Laura Palmer's dead, that is, without a doubt, a great thing as well. I'll say it again: Laura Palmer is one of the most interesting characters in television history, so it's no surprise that this is very much a positive trait. Another positive: most of the characters you got so attached to are back! Most notably, other than Laura, are Cooper, Donna (who is totally not portrayed by the same actress), and, of course, the log lady. The movie also focuses heavily on the relationship between Leland/Bob and Laura. Those were easily the most riveting scenes that the movie had to offer. Most of the movie is solidified in the craziness of Twin Peaks that we've all come to love, and that is mostly what this movie has to offer.All in all, if you are a fan of Twin Peaks, you will most likely enjoy Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. This does not necessarily mean that you will be satisfied per se, but it should at least keep a fan of the series entertained. It is, without a doubt, worth watching and does provide some sense of closure to the series, but doesn't necessarily give answers to the questions that we have been patiently waiting for.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
227,damon-47,Explore your Subconscious with another Lynch Masterpiece,10,29 September 2004,"I cannot say enough about this film that has not already been said. I feel like the personal impact on my life is where I can add unique information.To me personally I was no moved by this film I was up the entire night thinking about it. I'm not going to say much other then this : Do not deny yourself the pleasure of this file. Also note: This is absolutely not suitable for children or people who are easily shaken.Also, I am very upset that the extra footage is NOT AVAILABLE in any format that I am aware of. I have seen some rare photos from filming but I firmly believe we should not be denied this extra footage.Kind Regards, Damon Carr CEO http://www.agilefactor.com",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
228,richandles1,Another very weird movie by David Lynch the king of WEIRD!,2,30 January 2005,OK I just finished watching Twin Peaks by David Lynch and I'm not even sure why I finished. I guess like the rest of his movies I watched just to see what sick twisted thing he would do next. This is yet another perverse and strange tale by David Lynch that goes nowhere. He has a strange way of making movies so twisted and deranged that they keep you watching out of sheer disbelief and disgust. I have to admit the guy is a great movie maker all he has to do now is make a great movie. Moholland Dr. and Blue Velvet and now Twin Peaks...Does this guy make anything decent or is it all just for shock value. Don't waste your time on these films! Trust me you will get to the end and wonder why you just wasted two hours watching it.,Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
229,kileymeehan,unnecessary,3,13 July 2005,"I found this movie an odd experience. On one hand it has the trademark lynchian surrealism in abundance, at least throughout the first half, many of the images sure to play in your mind long after wards. on the other hand, the movie completely disregards the playful and comedic charms that made the series so lovable. The cast has been pared down to the bare necessities, mainly those revolving directly around Laura and her family, offering very little opportunity to offer any relief from the relentlessly dark and bleak plot that, for anybody familiar with the series, is mostly predictable. Overall a disappointing and unnecessary finale to the twin peaks phenomenon.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
230,mykechevy,Why did I watch this...,1,2 January 2016,"Listen to me. Don't watch this movie. Just don't. You will never be able to get this 2 hours of your life back. It's not worth it. In any way. Just don't... Don't do it.. Under any circumstance. Don't. terrible. just terrible. If i could rate this 0 stars I would. I would actually encourage IMDb to add a 0 star function specifically so that I could give this movie 0 stars. I may actually do that. Worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't write reviews. I have never written a review for a movie on IMDb. I felt so compelled to write this review simply to warn the world of how terrible it is. for every 2 hours wasted watching this movie an incredible film goes unseen. watch any other film.. Just not this one. Trust me, this may not be the best articulated review but if you don't watch this movie you'll be glad you read it. and if you do watch this movie after reading it I'm sure you will be also writing a shitty review like this wishing you had listened to me.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
231,naferrazza,A boring and pointless mess,2,10 September 2016,"Twin Peaks has long since been at the top of my list of shows to watch if given the opportunity. And when that opportunity arose, I was very impressed with what I saw. The bizarre mix of humour and surrealism makes for one of the best and most underrated TV shows I've ever had the privilege to watch. I'd heard the film wasn't the best, but I've enjoyed a lot of films that have received harsh criticism, and I expected this one to be another one of those.The first half an hour of this film was exactly what I was hoping for in this film. Even with his drastically reduced role, Kyle MacLachlan still manages to steal the screen for the few scenes he appears. And when he steps on the other side of the camera, David Lynch is always fun to watch as well. Add in a brief appearance by David Bowie to round things off, as well as a few Black Lodge residents, both new and old, and it's quite fun to watch. If the film had continued to be what this first act is, I'd have been impressed. Sadly, that's not the case.The remainder of the film follows Laura Palmer's life before her murder. Sure, it's interesting seeing the events that led to Laura's death, and Sheryl Lee does a great job in the role, but it's all so pointless. The film shows us nothing we hadn't already learned from the series. It's an hour and a half of the same stuff, but somehow presented in a far less interesting way than what the TV show managed to do.While not the worst film I've ever seen, it's possibly the most boring. It doesn't even feel like Twin Peaks. That playful and mysterious tone from the show is gone and replaced with, well, nothing really. It's like it doesn't even have a tone. It's just so dull.I wouldn't say it does anything to detract from the TV series, but it certainly doesn't add anything to it. If you want to see the whole Twin Peaks saga, then go ahead and watch it. Just be warned that your in for quite a boring two hours and fifteen minutes. I can almost guarantee that halfway through the film you'll find yourself pulling out your phone to check Facebook or whatever. This film just doesn't do enough to keep the audience's attention.I was hoping for answers to some of those unresolved plot threads from the TV series, but they certainly aren't here. I don't think a single plot thread from the show gets resolved by this film. Not one.I think what bugs me most though is all the deleted scenes I keep reading about. It seems like this film got the Batman v. Superman treatment. A ridiculously long A+ film was shot, before having all the good bits cut out, leaving us with the lackluster bare bones of what we could have had. Sadly, a lot of the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor sound like they could have made this movie into the kind of film I could have enjoyed. Instead, we just get two hours of Laura Palmer running around town high on drugs and screaming at shadows.Oh, and if for some reason you've not seen the TV series and you're planning to watch this, don't. While being too much of a rehash of the same old stuff to appeal to fans of the show, it somehow still manages to be too continuity heavy to appeal to new viewers. The whole things really just a boring and pointless mess.Here's hoping the 2017 TV series can do better, because a show like Twin Peaks deserves it.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
232,ryecatcher773,Garbage. Not even worthy of the TP faithful.,3,24 August 2011,"Massive disappointment, and I went into it thumbing my nose at those who had widely panned it. But, sadly, after watching the show faithfully for two full seasons, I will concur that this can only be described (and in particular, for the TP series faithful) as a load of forced crap.Lynch is very good at both portraying the surreal and (in his own odd way) character development. Success in surrealism however, at least in film, is dependent on establishing a good juxtaposition with established norms... and for whatever reason, Lynch and his screenwriters here missed the boat (or perhaps ate too many mushrooms while waiting for that boat to depart).The characters (and actors who played them) are weak shadows of who they were in the excellent, quirky, TV series. The story is weak, and (most importantly) McLachlan's 'Special Agent Dale Cooper' is a boring, wooden caricature of himself. Bowie and Issak were obviously added for a heavyweight celebrity presence, as were Harry Dean Stanton and Keifer Sutherland... but even if they were fans of the original themselves, they bring nothing a few recent acting school grads couldn't have easily brought.Small wonder why the promoters were quick to point out that this was successful in Japan, as only a foreign audience not accustomed to the idiosyncrasies of the original (which is what help make the original series so great) would appreciate it.Two thumbs down. Just glad I only paid 5 dollars for the used DVD.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
233,donniedean,Watch the Q2 Fan Edit,9,13 July 2017,"This is a very good film. When David Lynch re-released his original cut in 1992 there was over an hour of footage that was edited out of the final cut. For years fans were begging to see this footage. Then after 22 years ""David Lynch"" did release them. They are refereed to as ""The Missing Pieces"". As nice as it was to see these scenes they were not edited back into the film. I just watched the Q2 fan edit for the first time and it was GREAT!!!It made ""Fire Walk With ME"" more complete. I have seen the original version many times and still enjoyed even if it didn't make too much sense! THE Q2 fan edit makes the whole film make sense. The Q2 fan edit reinserts the missing pieces and places them in the order in which they appeared in the screenplay. Also restored is a countdown. It tells you how many days Laura Palmer has left to live. Now upon watching this fan edit you can full understand why David Lynch cut them. However he should have left in all the Theresa Banks Footage. He also she have kept in the David Bowie scenes.The fan edit runs about 3.5 Hours. If your a fan of season 3 of ""Twin Peaks"" then you must see the fan edit!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
234,paawsha,2 hours lost forever in the oblivion !!!,1,18 December 2017,"I only singed in to rate this movie 1/10 stars. I just lost 2 hours of my life. It's overly ""art"" idea made this good idea into a series of cut scenes which are put together bad and make no goddamn sense! This damn movie is for tumblr nerds and overthinking snowflakes! Better watch Mad Max,at least it has a plot!!!!!!!!!!! So fucking REGRETS!!!!!",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
235,emmetation,Waste of time...,3,5 January 2010,"I think the TV series finally gave me an insight into Lynch's mind: He likes to torture you with meaningless symbolism for comedic value. I loved the series. So much fun to watch, however it did go off on a tangent towards the end. The film brings you right back to the beginning to try and put some closure on the mystery. In the very simple sense it does, it lets you know who did it. On the David Lynch level it simply bombards you with useless, meaningless nonsense symbolism until you just can't take it anymore... Nothing makes any sense, or maybe I just don't understand things on the level that Lynch means for me to...or maybe I am not worthy of this valued understanding...whatever...some people actually think they read the lips of a 3 second monkey face shot and it meant something related to the plot..get real people...Enjoy the series, skip through the movie as fast as possible. That's my advice.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
236,ante_drt,Not my cup of tea and not a must watch before watching the 2017 Twin Peaks,4,15 February 2020,"I was told to watch this before watching the third season of Twin Peaks. Damn did I regret watching this. Simply put,this is little more than two hours of weirdness. Sure it brings up some things about the life of Laura Palmer before her death but nothing really special.I loved the first two seasons of TP and I'm looking forward to watching the third but man this movie was really bad and I don't think you need or would want to watch this. It kinda ruined the nice things about the series for me. Do something else for two hours instead, I do not recommend this movie to anyone unfortunately.",Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me
