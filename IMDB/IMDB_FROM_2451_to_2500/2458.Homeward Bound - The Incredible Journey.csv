0,TheLittleSongbird,Charming and beautifully filmed movie!,9,6 May 2009,"First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the film's charm. The best aspect of the movie were the three animals, superlatively voiced by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. Whereas Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character(the voice of reason), and Field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling Chance off. The humans weren't as engaging, and sometimes the film dragged, but that is my only complaint. This is one beautiful-looking film, with beautiful close up shots of Canada, I believe. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script. All in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
1,Hitchcoc,It's Reigning Cats and Dogs,7,29 December 2016,"This is a story of three animals who become lost and must make their way back home. There is a cat, Sassy, who is mouthy and annoying. Chance, an immature, careless, reckless dog. And Shadow, the mature, well traveled voice of reason. Of course, these animals talk to each other. Two of them are determined. One, Chance (who lives up to his name) gets careless and overly adventurous, putting the others in danger. Shadow is an optimist. He believes sincerely that they will eventually be found and returned to their families. It's a good story and the voices are superimposed. They are not made to talk with some twisted mouth, to look like humans. This is a great movie for children. It is about love and compassion and commitment to an ideal. It also expresses the idea of never giving up.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
2,jboothmillard,Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,5,20 June 2005,"Remakes are a very dubious thing to do, but this one from Disney, based on its own 1963 original, based on an aspiring true story, is actually quite good. Basically Chance the dog (voiced by Michael J. Fox), Shadow the dog (voiced by Don Ameche) and Sassy the cat (voiced by Sally Field) are left behind by their family, and when they are delayed, the pets begin a perilous journey through forest, across mountain, countryside and rivers, in order to get back to their owners. Danger is bound nearly every step of the way, whether it is from rushing water, giant cats, uneven floors, they pull through and manage to get back to their family for the happy ending. Also starring Airplane's Robert Hays as Bob Seaver, Kim Greist as Laura Burnford-Seaver, Benj Thall as Peter Burnford, Veronica Lauren as Hope Burnford and Kevin Chevalia as Jamie Seaver. Having seen the original myself, I would say it is very, very slightly better, but with the addition of the animals having voices, it gives them more personality, and it certainly makes for fun viewing for all the family. Worth watching!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
3,michaelRokeefe,Three household pets are on their own.,7,27 August 2007,"Fun film for the entire family. A captivating story about a bulldog pup named Chance(voiced by Michael J. Fox); Sassy, a Himalayan cat(voiced by Sally Field); and Shadow, a wise old golden retriever(voiced by Don Ameche)end up fending for themselves as they set out on an incredible journey home. The owners of these beloved pets leave them with a friend(Jean Smart) as the father(Robert Hays)takes a temporary assignment. The three pets believe they have been left behind for good; so they face mountains, waterfalls, a bobcat, bears and a porcupine on their trek back home. Beautiful Oregon scenery and a story that tugs at the heartstrings. Also in the cast: Kim Greist, Kevin Chevalia, Veronica Lauren and Woody Eney.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
4,Calicodreamin,Cute fluff movie,7,2 May 2020,"A cute kids movie, that I enjoy watching from time to time. The voice acting is excellent and well cast, the animal characters are really brought to life. The storyline has good flow and I always cry at the end. Just a feel good fluff film.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
5,neil-476,Typical Disney family fare,7,2 May 2015,"Disney remakes The Incredible Journey: the location is different (Oregon here, doubling for California), the breeds of the itinerant trio have been tweaked, the family is a bit higher profile, and this time there is no narrator: the animal threesome are voiced by notable talent (Don Ameche, Sally Field, Michael J Fox).Otherwise, the mixture is much as before - a journey full of trials, with spectacular scenery as a backdrop, chuckles here and there, and a handful of tear-jerking moments.The scenery is indeed spectacular, the editing is very skillful, the script is none too special, but is largely saved by the sheer professionalism of the voice talent. This is one for a family Sunday afternoon: adults in the absence of kids will find it sugary enough to induce diabetes.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
6,HotToastyRag,My favorite Sally Field performance,10,5 September 2021,"I've seen the original The Incredible Journey, and the 1993 remake has given it one simple - but vital - improvement: the animals talk. In the original, the entire movie is just told by an outsider's narration. In this one, Michael J. Fox voices the inner thoughts of young bulldog Chance, Sally Field personifies the Siamese cat Sassy, and Don Ameche (in his final movie) plays the old faithful retriever Shadow.When Kim Greist remarries, to nice guy Robert Hayes, the kids have to leave their animals at Jean Smart's farm for a while. Robert's job takes them to a different city, and they need to get established before going back for the animals. It's a very tearful goodbye, especially for Don Ameche and his owner. In fact, it's so painful, when a miscommunication happens, the animals take it into their hearts to follow their owners and run away from the farm.So starts the incredible journey. It truly is incredible, with waterfalls, bears, porcupines, little food, and lack of direction. But the animals love their humans, and they're willing to withstand anything to be reunited with them again. Most of the movie is hilarious, with constant bickering between Sassy and Chance - pretty much everything out of Sassy's ""mouth"" is side-splittingly funny - but there are some very suspenseful moments. And I guarantee you're going to need a Kleenex at the end.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
7,JamesHitchcock,Enjoyable film for all the family- especially animal lovers,7,9 February 2009,"I haven't seen the original ""Incredible Journey"" since I was a child, so I can't really compare the two versions. This version tells the story of three animals, two dogs and a cat, whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in San Francisco. The pets, believing that they have been abandoned, escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness.This story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon, but both versions are in fact live-action films made using real animals. One major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices, giving each its own distinct personality, something that was not done in the original film. (A similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children's films such as ""Racing Stripes""). Some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device, but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it. The animals were voiced by big-name stars, Don Ameche, Michael J. Fox and Sally Fields.Both dogs are male, and their relationship parallels that between many humans in ""buddy-buddy"" movies. Shadow, a golden retriever, is the wise, experienced older dog; Chance the younger one is brash, cocky and impulsive. To British eyes Chance looks like a boxer, but is actually an American Bulldog, which is apparently a different breed to its British cousin. Sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality. She is very proud of her status as a cat, which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog. (""Cats rule, dogs drool!"").From an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults; it can be sentimental, some of the incidents (such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river) are quite incredible, and the human characters are all completely forgettable. This, however, is a film which is mainly aimed at children, and I suspect they will enjoy it immensely. Certainly, any animal-loving child will do so. (Comments by some professional critics such as James Berardinelli, who complained that the animals' voices lessened the film's ""grandeur"", only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children's movies. I doubt if many playground conversations about ""Homeward Bound"" concentrated on its supposed grandeur).One thing adults will appreciate is the photography of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. They may also appreciate the film's blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears, mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness. This is a very enjoyable family film. 7/10",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
8,Smells_Like_Cheese,The perfect family film,6,31 January 2004,"Homeward Bound is a great family film, one of the last best used with talking animals. Still to this day I cannot resist watching this film, and I still laugh, keep my eyes glued to the screen and I cannot help but cry. I always have to have a major box of tissues next to me when I watch this movie. It has such a soul and is a great story with wonderful characters. All of us as children had pets who were like our best friends and they were just as loyal back and Homeward Bound shows us the love that animals could have for their owners.Chance, an American Bulldog, explains that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford, but expresses no interest in his owner or having a ""home"". He shares his home with Shadow, an older Golden Retriever owned by Jamie's brother Peter, and Sassy, a Himalayan cat, owned by their sister Hope. Bob Seaver is marrying Laura Burnford, joining the family. Shortly after the wedding, the family goes on a trip to San Francisco, leaving the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate, a family friend. Kate later goes on a cattle drive, leaving the animals at the ranch to be looked after by one of her ranch hands. However, the animals think they have been abandoned, and Shadow begins to worry about Peter, so he decides to go find them. Sassy and a reluctant Chance follow. They head into the rocky, mountainous wilderness, with Shadow leading by instinct but of course the road is a bumpy one and it's not an easy journey coming back home.I'm going to give a few spoilers here, so don't read on if you haven't seen this movie. There are some absolute great laughs, with Sally Field as Sassy you just couldn't go wrong. Her leading the vet security guard around was so cute and very funny. Plus when Chance is curious about a porcupine, Shadow and Sassy warn him to get away, but being a dog he can't help but wonder and BAM, ""it bit me with it's butt!"", he's stung with the needles, poor Chance, but what a funny scene! Then there are some very touching moments where Chance is learning how wonderful life could be having a home. The scene where Sassy is reunited with Chance and Shadow was wonderful. Then there are the tear jerker moments that are killer. Shadow falls into a muddy pit where he hurts his leg and can't get out, Chance tries to help him but Shadow thinks he's too old and can't move and says to Chance ""I've taught you everything you needed to know, now all you need to learn is how to say good-bye"", I'm actually tearing up as I'm writing it, seriously. Then Shadow makes a triumphant return into Peter's arms and seeing him act like a puppy was so wonderful. I adore this movie, the voices, the setting, the story, it's just a touching family movie that is perfect to watch. I have no complaints about this movie and could go on, but trust me when I say it's more than worth the watch.10/10",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
9,cricketbat,This movie makes me cry every. single. time.,10,21 November 2020,"This movie gets me every single time. I've seen Homeward Bound many, many times, and I always get teary-eyed at the end. This is one of those rare talking pet movies where the voice actors and the on-screen animals are both worthy of praise. Plus, you can tell some actual care went into the writing and the filmmaking. The humor is clever, the story has heart, and this film is definitely one I recommend.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
10,ironhorse_iv,"Take me home, movie! I felt like I arrived home, so relax when watching this movie!",7,1 August 2014,"While, it's loosely based on the Walt Disney 1960's film, 'The Incredible Journey', Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey prove to be a great movie. I do remember, watching this movie, when I was a child, and finding myself, very entertain. This thrilling and thoroughly captivating movie has become an instant favorite with audiences of all ages. It's been years since I first saw this, and even today, I can find myself, tearing up for this. Based off, the best-selling novel, The Incredible Journey by Sheila Burnford, the movie directed by Duwayne Dunham, tells the story about three household pets getting lost in the wilderness, on their way to reunite with their owners. The movie is told by narration by Chance, a young American bulldog (voiced by Michael J. Fox), whom tells the misadventures, he had with a wise old golden retriever, Shadow (Voiced by Don Ameche) and a feisty Himalayan cat, Sassy (voiced by Sally Fields). While, the movie is for children, the movie did had some really get frighten scary action scenes for adults. With great editing, the animals really did look like they were in endanger, from waterfalls, mountain lions, and even porcupine. My heart was racing in every scene. I really care for them, and really hope, they survive the journey. This movie made me care, more than 1987's Benji the Hunted. These three animals are so well trained in this film. The owners did such an amazing job with the animals. I was deeply surprised that the cat that play Sassy AKA Tiki was train so well to not only interact with the dogs, but also do a lot of active things. My cat just sit on her butt, all day. Even the small stuff like the dog that play Shadow, AKA Ben sighing on the porch at the home they were left at, was amazing. There was also a great shot of Shadow look like he's shouting run, when the mountain lion appears. Don't get me started with the emotional scene toward the end. Goes to show Hollywood does not need all the computer work involved in animating animals. Still- there were so badly done takes that they kept in, for some inside laughs. It has to do with the dog that play Chance named Rattler. He always tripped or knocking into things like trees. A good example of this is in the reunion scene with Sassy where he trip over a gopher hole. Rattler still had some really funny reactions. I love the cake eating scene, and him playing with the chickens. I do like the movie is view as the animal's POV. You truly get the sense of how life is like for a dog and a cat. They don't truly understand, vacation or short-term leave. They only know, how it feels to be abandoned. I like how the journey starts by misunderstanding. This being a pre-1996's Babe talking critter flick. The dogs and character don't actually talk with their mouth. It just pasted instead on top of their filmed behaviors, a technique which looks more convincing in some scenes than others. Other times, what is being said, doesn't matched what's happening on screen. Great voice actors. Don Ameche really got the token of wisdom/insight down. Michael J. Fox was both funny and youthful. Still a lot of what he said, like Birdzilla and Arnold Schwarzen-kitty is so out there, that makes you need to suspense your disbelief, even more since they don't understand human speech or some human actions. Last, Sally Field indeed got the lady charms balance. She wasn't too unlikeable. She was snarky, but kind and heroic. The characters are way different than the ones in the book. Shadow is Luath's breed type which is a retriever, but has the personality of Bodger's old age. Chance in the book is English bull terrier named Bodger and has the goofy personality of Luath's age. The other big different is that, Sassy in the book is a male Siamese cat named Tao. Even the family was change, from the Hunters to the Burnfords as homage to the original author. Not only is the characters different from the book, but most of the story. In this movie, the three don't meet up with any Native Americans during their trip. The location was switch from the wilderness of Canada, to Sierra Nevada Mountain Range as well. Beautiful use of locations. The soundtrack by composer Bruce Broughton always remembers me to my man's best friend or a really good Western. The Reunited part is just epic. It even used great establish songs, fine, like the Mission: Impossible theme plays as Sassy infiltrates the pound. That was fun to listen and watch. There was a sequel released in 1996, Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco. In my opinion, it's not worth watching, the sequel. They should had just stick to one film. Overall: This is a movie for all ages but especially kids will love this due to the animals and the clever humor. Animal enthusiasts' adults would love it for the action and depth. It has everything what a movie for the whole family needs. A must watch.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

13,zkonedog,"Can A Film About Talking Animals Really Make You Cry? In This Case, Yes!",10,12 March 2017,"As a young child, I watched this movie many times over, enjoying the silly humor of the three animals and being completely sucked in by the sappy message. Many years later, I again sat down to watch it with my younger sister...and again found myself transported back to my childhood, even to the point of brushing back tears at the final touching scene.It is very obvious why this film was bound to be a hit with children: Almost all children love animals, the humor is at a level that even young ones can laugh at, and the three protagonists are ones that all children can identify with: the aged Golden Retriever Shadow, the frisky pup Chance, and the sharp-tongued and witty cat Sassy.Surprisingly, however, the film will also both touch and entertain viewers who have graduated elementary school. The ""characters"" aren't too cheesy to make you roll your eyes, the plot isn't so animal-rights leaning (like Free Willy, for example) that it will make your stomach turn, and I think that the simple love between a child and his/her pet is something that we can still relate to long after we've ""grown up"". If you are not dabbing at your eyes (or at least seeing through some mist) as the end credits roll, then the fault may just lie within your cynical self.So, I would highly recommend this movie for family viewing of any and all kinds. For your child it will be a wonderful adventure, while at the same time you will be transported back to a time when life was much more innocent...childhood.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

16,lisafordeay,An adorable film about 2 dogs and a cat trying to find their way home,10,16 July 2014,"Homeward Bound is a 1993 film that is a remake of the 1963 film of the same name and tells the story of 2 dogs named Chance and Shadow alongside a persian cat called Sassy who's owners are happily married and decide to go off on a honeymoon,leaving the three animals to stay where they are. Of course Shadow doesn't want to go anywhere else and so he decides to go off on an adventure to find his owner. Chance and Sassy also agree and they go off in their little cute heartwarming adventure together. The last time I seen this movie was when I was a kid and it was a pleasure to pick it up for a bargain on Sunday in HMV. The story is really nice and I like the part where Sassy goes missing and the two dogs mess around with a leopard and the part near the end where Shadow falls down a wrecked train railing and Chance won't leave without him.You have to be the biggest cynic not to love this movie and its now one of my all time favourite movies.

17,r96sk,Improves on the original,7,25 September 2020,"It improves on the original, that's all you want from a remake.I just about, marginally, liked the 1963 film, whereas I actually did comfortably enjoy 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey'. The animals are as adorable in this as they are in the first film, with more definitive care taken for them - that's not, arguably, the case in the '63 production.The premise is changed up in some areas, there's a scene that proceeds the conclusion which is rather nice and isn't in the other. The whole feel of this is more engaging, helped by the fact that it gives the animals a voice which works better than just a sole narrator; as was done in the 60s.Michael J. Fox is a strong choice for the voice role of Chance, while Sally Field and Don Ameche are solid in their roles as Sassy and Shadow respectively. Those three help make this a fairly enjoyable 84 minutes.Another positive thing is the locations, with some wonderful shots of the environment that the animals traverse through. Overall, a good film - nothing more, nothing less.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

Found it streaming and was looking for some background material and I just couldn't help but love it all over again. I probably shouldn't have laughed like I did, gotten all worked up for them again, worked over them again but I did.This is just a wonderful family film. It's funny and heartfelt and the voice acting is wonderful. Would absolutely recommend this to families looking for something to enjoy together.

20,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Not worth it, just another hokey and obnoxious talking animal film...",4,17 September 2014,"I've never been much of a fan of films about talking animals, but I'd read the book 'The Incredible Journey' in school and bought this on DVD.Big mistake; while I likely would've adored it when I was three or four years old, I found it to just be your basic generic Disney crud. Chance, Sassy and Shadow are three pets owned by a family with the newly married mother. When the pets get lost in the woods, they go through hell trying to get home, in a very melodramatic tale.The soundtrack was okay, but certainly not memorable.The acting wasn't very good and the voices of the animals were weird and seemed really out of place. In the book the animals went missing in Canada but it's California in this movie. We get plenty of dog poop jokes and vulgar humor, including a comment about dogs rolling in droppings and saying things such as ""I'm too pooped to poop."" It's obnoxiously goofy, and not in a funny way but more in a lame and annoying way that tries too hard. The dog Chance's constant comparison of the pound to prison or foster care, talking about how he ""lived on the street and ended up behind bars until he was adopted"" among other things just got really petty and stupid quickly.I'm not a kid anymore so I can't speak from the point of view of a child, but perhaps I'd have enjoyed it more had I been a younger kid. My personal opinion though is that it's not worth buying or watching unless you're getting it for your kids.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
21,Beta_Gallinger,"Very nice scenery and an exciting adventure, but the characters and humour generally aren't so impressive",6,20 April 2010,"I remember seeing most of this family adventure movie as a kid. It was released early in 1993, and I think I saw it on video later that year. Towards the end, I came across a scene which I found too overwhelmingly sad, and I guess I didn't watch what little was left of the film, though I did watch the sequel, ""Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco"", from beginning to end shortly after it was released on video in 1996. I believe it's been nearly seventeen years since I watched any of ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"", but after all these years, I still remember it. After renting it this month, I can say I've finally seen it all. While it's not what I would call a bad movie, I was definitely not as impressed as many others clearly have been.Chance is a naïve young Bulldog who was once stuck at the pound, a place he hated, but is now owned by a boy named Jamie Seaver. He lives with two other domestic animals: Shadow, a wise old Golden Retriever owned by Jamie's stepbrother, Peter Burnford; and Sassy, an arrogant Himalayan cat owned by Peter's sister, Hope. After Laura Burnford and Bob Seaver get married, meaning that the two families are now one, they go on a trip to San Francisco and the pets are left at a friend's ranch. Chance, Shadow, and Sassy do not understand what has just happened, and don't realize that their owners will come back, so they think they've been abandoned! Shadow decides to leave the ranch and set out to find the family, and Sassy and Chance soon follow! The three of them find themselves on a journey through the wilderness, facing the dangers of this terrain! Chance's lack of experience definitely won't help him on this adventure.The silly things Chance does and the rivalry between Chance and Sassy are meant to be comical, which they sometimes are, but not usually. Chance's antics can also get tiring after a short while. I didn't care much for these two characters, and don't think Michael J. Fox and Sally Field did a very good job providing their respective voices. Don Ameche as Shadow might be the only decent voice-over of the three, and this character is the most likable of the leads. After I started watching ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" this month, I soon realized how boring I found the film, and that didn't change until I got to the part where the journey begins. There's lots of beautiful scenery through the mountainous wilderness and the adventure of the three domestic animals is often exciting. Shadow's wisdom can be another intriguing aspect of the film, and some scenes are fairly touching, such as the Golden Retriever saving a little girl lost in the forest. However, there's still more weak humour during the adventure, and the scenes with the humans looking for the animals are certainly not as interesting as the ones showing the pets on their journey. None of the human characters really stand out.With a spoiler warning, I will tell you which part made me really sad all those years ago, and the ending that follows. If you haven't seen the film, you might not want to read on, but if you have, then maybe you've already guessed. It's the part where the three pets are almost home, but Shadow falls into a pit and injures his leg, and it appears he can't get out! When I watched ""Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco"", I knew the aging dog obviously got out of the pit somehow, since he's in that sequel. After over a decade and a half, I finally found out that ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" doesn't show how Shadow gets out, but at the end, we see the three animals returning to their owners, even though it takes the Golden Retriever longer to show up than it does for the other two. Anyway, overall, this particular animal movie is hit-and-miss, with an exciting adventure and cute animal stars, but also with several significant shortcomings.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

Um sorry, just having a 'moment' there. Don't worry Mr Doctor, I'm still taking the meds.Lets talk about the movie, shall we? We all love pets, right? Well, apart from goldfish. No one likes them. They're B-O-R-I-N-G. Or perhaps I feel that way because of flashbacks from my many uncomfortable hours spent in a dentist's waiting room. *Feels Dentures*. SWEETS ARE JUST TOO GOOOOD. Oops, going off track again. Time for a double dose...I'm back. Much calmer now. Yes, this is all about two dogs who get the wrong end of the stick (ho ho), along with a cat when they are temporarily left at a ranch while their family relocates. Thinking they've been abandoned, they run off to begin a perilous trek through the wilderness to find their owners. Encounters with bears, waterfalls and mountain lions are guaranteed, along with plenty of infighting from these very different species.Yes, of course... what with this being Hollywood, one of the canines is an old, loyal, sensible stick-in-the mud (Coincidentally, this happens to him at one point) and the other is a young, irresponsible, hyperactive ball of fun. I shouldn't need to tell you about the feline. In Movieland, they have but one default setting: Sarcastic, self-obsessed, sneaky narcissists. Hey, I love it. Reminds me of someone...Together, they brave the elements, overcoming whatever obstacles cross their path... and of course, discovering that co-operation and friendship is key to their survival. It's Disney, whadya expect?! We hear LOTS of jokes about the various stereotypical views the creatures have towards each other, including one too many butt sniffing gags for my liking. It's all in good fun though, and certainly more palatable than coming from the mouth of say, Adam Sandler.The animal training is top notch... how they managed to line-up the four legged cast to do so many scenes together with absolute unity is a marvel all on it's own. It's not quite Babe, but mostly seamless nonetheless. Their many adventures will err towards kids, but don't think we as adults would be immune to it's charm. If you don't get a warm glow at the very last scene... then I don't wanna know you. Although some would say that isn't such a bad thing... 6/10",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

25,Atreyu_II,One of the nicest animal movies,10,26 July 2007,"'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is one of those great old movies about house pets. Deserves a place among the great movies of its genre, together with others like 'Old Yeller', 'Napoleon', 'Fluke' and 'Air Bud'. This means it is more than just a movie about pets.Can this possibly be just a ""remake""? It is too good to be a ""remake""! I first saw this in 1996 or 1997 on television. I was 12 years old at the time. Of course, back in those days I was far from imagining that there is actually an original motion picture. Although I am all against ""remakes"", this is a unique case of a ""remake"" I happen to like better than the original. The basic plot is very similar in both movies, but the original feels more like a documentary than a movie. The ""remake"" is more movie-like, more humorous and with some significant changes, but without abandoning the values of the original.This is a nice family movie, one to treasure. Certainly one to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films. A classic. It's dramatic, full of adventure, highly entertaining, charming, nostalgic and heartwarming. Cinematography is wonderful (with dazzling landscapes/sceneries of the magnificent Sierra mountains). Speaking of the vistas, it's not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets... in conclusion, all of pure nature's wonders - truly a full panorama. And I haven't talked about the soundtrack, which is more than capable of making the most emotional sequences more powerful.For me, the saddest scenes in the film are: when Peter waves goodbye to Shadow and Shadow begs him to wait; when Shadow falls into a deep muddy hole and gets hurt and can't get out (even telling that it's time to learn how to say goodbye); the ending, when the 3 pets return to their human family (which includes a sad scene which Peter thinks that Shadow was too old to make it moments before the dog returns).When it comes to our quadruped pals, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the wise, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retriever. Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play. Chance just can't stand still. Sassy is the epitome of cats's image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude but a certain feline charm. Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Our four-legged friends are, themselves, great ""actors"" by nature. The human actors (including the voice actors) aren't the only ones who shine in their roles.Underrated or not, successful at the theaters or not, this movie is a success for its fans. The sequel doesn't repeat its magic and charm, being far inferior. This should definitely be on Top 250.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
26,rebeljenn,"Difficult to watch, slow-moving film",2,30 December 2005,"'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" is the remake of the older Disney film. The film features three pets who band together in order to find their owners. The animals consist of a pretty wimpish cat, a young dog, and an older dog. They each have different personalities, but they learn to work together and learn to overcome their differences because they need everyone on their journey and to brave the harsh nature.I watched this film when I was younger, before my teens. I found the film to be slow-moving and dull, although I did enjoy the original film. I found Michael J Fox's character to be a little annoying too. However, I think that you may enjoy this film if you like being outdoors and like pets. Expect it to be a little slow-moving, however. Children may like Fox's character and wisecracks, and animal enthusiasts may enjoy it, but I found it too slow-moving and annoying in places to call it a decent film.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

28,Darkside-Reviewer,Da Da Batdog!,10,4 April 2020,"I first saw this movie when I was just 9 years old on a Sunday afternoon watching TV with my family nothing was on so we sat and watched a movie about animals getting lost in the wilderness and since then this movie has been a big part of my life some of my fondest memories are of me and my family watching this movie together with our pets my sister with her cat Smokey my mum with her cat Lucky and me with my dog Sheba the movie made us laugh and cry every single time I'm now 30 years old and sadly our best friends have passed away in that time but we all have countless pictures and memories with them and whenever I'm sad, lonely, upset or am missing my pets I watch Homeward Bound and it makes me smile again with a few extra tears from the sad parts of the movie that still make me cry over 21 years and about a hundred viewings later.The movie follows three animals an old wise dog named Shadow (Don Ameche) a young energetic pup named Chance (Michael J Fox) and a smart and cunning cat named Sassy (Sally Field) the three are left on a farm while their human family are away for a few months but after waiting for them the trio decide that it's been to long and they will find them instead so they travel through the mountains and wilderness looking for home and their family on a huge and dangerous journey that will test their friendship as they journey together to make it home.The voice acting for the animals is brilliant and very well done especially considering it's human voices for animals the scenery is absolutely stunning the animals who star in the movie are some of the most well trained animals ever put to film and you can really see that the people who made the movie really cared for these animals and treated them all with love and respect it's heart-warming.This is a perfect family movie and is enjoyable for both kids and adults who love animals I highly recommend watching this movie and it is now available on Disney+ so it's easy to find and watch.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

30,Min111,A good adventure movie,7,8 August 2020,"What an adventure for these three animals. They're on a journey to reach home. It's a long journey for Chance, Sassy and Shadow. Chance is the American Bulldog; Sassy is the Himalayan Cat; Shadow is the Golden Retriever. Chance, Sassy and Shadow happen to be their names. I know: their names are weird. They need to work as a team though in order to find their way home. It's an incredible journey. I liked every minute of it. You're also part of their adventure, and are rooting for them to reach home. A home where they belong. The owners leave the animals behind right before they depart for holiday. The animals think they've been abandoned. The animals go on a long journey, so they can be back together with their family. Can they make it home? You need to see it to find out. What I find 'amazing' is how the animals know their way around. They seem to know where they're going. I don't know how that's possible. The odds of them reaching home is slim. They must be very smart or something. Shadow is the one that leads the charge. He's the senior dog. He happens to be my favourite. I still liked Chance and Sassy. Chance is the funny one. The most interesting thing about Chance is who it was played by. He was played by Michael J. Fox who's famous for the 'Back to the Future' films. That was good to know. He was funny. His voice is so recognisable. The best thing about 'Homeward Bound' is that it runs for a short time. It runs under ninety minutes. The producers got the timing or duration perfectly right. It's an adventure movie. I happen to like adventures, and I know many of you do too. It's a movie made for the family. The owners of the animals are a nice family that happen to like their animals. The kids care about them. Chance belongs to Jamie; Sassy belongs to Hope; Shadow belongs to Peter. It's also a movie made for people that like animals. Your cats and dogs may even like the movie if you have any.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
31,oOoBarracuda,Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,7,12 August 2016,"Any time you settle in for a talking animal movie, one never knows how cheesy of a movie they are in for. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, the 1993 feature by director Duwayne Dunham was not plagued by some of the common problems in talking animal movies. The two dogs and a cat who make the incredible journey to find the owners they think have abandoned them, are well-written and given interesting enough personalities for the audience to get engaged in their stories and sit at attention with them until the very end. Setting out to find their owners and the only home they've ever known, the animals learn a lot about love and comradery along the way. Life is good for Shadow (Don Ameche), Chance (Michael J. Fox), and Sassy (Sally Field). Both dogs and the cat are cared for and loved incessantly by their wonderful attentive owners. After their owners marry and their family grows, something unusual happens. They notice a lot of suitcases and they go to a strange place. Unbeknownst to them, Bob Seaver (Robert Hays) has gotten a researching job in San Francisco and will be temporarily locating the family there until his project is done. Leaving the animals at a friend of their female owner's, the family leaves with promises misunderstood by the animals of returning for visits. Perplexed at their loving owner's abandonment, Shadow is convinced a mistake has been made and encourages the dogs to follow him in an attempt to find their owners. Traversing the rough and wild terrain proves more than the animals anticipated, and soon wonder if they will be safe and loved ever again. The visuals in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey were strikingly captivating, much grander and more beautiful than I expected from a children's movie. The establishment shots in the beginning especially, were breathtaking capturing the true wilderness the animals would have to endure. Watching a family movie, one expects a decent amount of clean packaging, which did occur in Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, it is easily forgiven however because the creatures were so well-written. It was fun to follow along with the main characters despite them not being human. Talking animal films are usually in a class by themselves as far as cheesiness. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey doesn't suffer from such cheese, however. I believe, a large reason why Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is so tolerable is because the animals mouths don't move in sync with their dialogue. I always thought that the synced mouth movements and dialogue was a peculiar choice for filmmakers of talking animal movies. The decision makes it no more believable that animals are actually talking simply because their mouths move like human's when they speak. A few brilliant filmmaking decisions, a beautifully shot film, and a perfect ending scene make Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey the perfect film from one's childhood with their own blossoming families.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

Left in good hands on a farm, the animals feel abandoned by their masters, determined to find them. The 3 pets 'escape' only to endure many challenges. Upon hearing what happened, the family begins a desperate search for their beloved pets.Of course, all ends well. This film does more than give a mushy account of a pet/master reunion; there are serious 'situations' dealt with honestly and with feeling.

33,TheHonestCritic,"One of the best family/animal films of all-time, in my opinion. How does it hold up today?",10,12 June 2020,"""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" (1993), whenever someone mentions animal film, or family film, this movie is one of those that comes into my mind. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" is one of my top 10 all-time favorite family films! This movie is based off a novel of the same name written by Sheila Burnford. Also, this film is a remake of an older movie; ""The Incredible Journey"" (1963). This is another example of a remake that's better than the original! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. The story at first glance may seem like your basic story of pets getting lost and trying to find their way home. However, in this movie it's done in such a fresh, unique and heartwarming way. There are plenty of comedic parts and hard-hitting emotional scenes. It has the perfect balance of comedy and drama, which is what all family or children films should be. The acting is flawless from all of the actors and actresses. But, the shining stars are the ones who voice our furry leads. Michael J. Fox is fun and hilarious as Chance, Don Ameche (R.I.P.) is wonderful and charming as Shadow and Sally Field is great, funny and of course perfectly sarcastic for the voice of Sassy. Had someone else did their voices, it may not have worked. Props to the casting agents! The voice actors, including the human cast of characters definitely help make this film shine. All of the sets/locations are gorgeous in this movie, especially the Sierra Nevada range. The rugged wilderness of that region really gives this movie an exciting atmosphere! All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack is stellar. Bruce Broughton's music certainly adds several great layers of dimension and helps bring this movie to life. It's honestly one of the greatest soundtracks in any family film. Kudos to you, Bruce Broughton! ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" is a phenomenal family movie. I could watch this film over and over and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"", go watch it today, especially if you have kids. Your children will love it! But, this movie is perfect for all ages. ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" is truly a great adventurous journey you'll never forget.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

36,cosmic_quest,Disney at its best,7,4 May 2006,"We've all heard stories about loyal pets who traverse hundreds of mile across unknown territory to be reunited with their beloved owners. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is a heart-warming film based upon these poignant stories and is an example that Disney can produce films that are warm without condescending too much into being cavity-inducing.In this film, we follow Shadow, the old wise Golden Retriever; Sassy, the snotty and ladylike cat, and Chance, the rambunctious bulldog pup, who are temporarily left on a small farm while their three child owners relocate to a new city with their parents. When they are not claimed within a couple of days, the pets fear a terrible fate has befallen the children so they escape and travel across America to return to the side of young owners.On the backdrop of some beautiful scenery of America, we witness how the animals can express incredible bonds of loyalty to each other and their human owners and their determination that drives them on. You really empathised with these characters even if they did have four legs and a tail! And the ending would melt even a heart of stone with owners of older pets being left with a warm glow.I have to admit that I love this film as much now as I did when I first saw it aged twelve. It reminds me so much of my own pets: my first dog Toby being the wise Shadow, my snobby cat Fifi definitely fitting of Sassy and the two youngest dogs Kasey and Jake the wee pup vying to be youthfully, energetic Chance. Toby, Fifi and Kasey have since gone over the Rainbow Bridge but this film never fails to strike a chord in reminiscing over them.'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is one of the few Disney films that will appeal to the smallest of kids to grannies in their eighties.

37,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Great Heartwarming Family Film(SPOILERS),7,10 December 2006,"SPOILERSYes, this is not a Holiday film. Anyway, I have always loved Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey since I was a young child. I have always been a huge animal lover since I was young. I have always loved films like this. Films like Beethoven, Cats and Dogs, and more. I don't know why, I mean, I'm a guy. Anyway, I have always loved this film for it's comedic scenes, sad, heartwarming scenes, and the way the animals survive.When two dogs and a cat go to a farm when their family goes away for a couple of days the eldest dog named Shadow thinks something is wrong with them and they are in trouble. Shadow wants to look for them. The other two do not. They follow him anyway. Throughout the film they fight for survival. The cat named Sassy is swept away by a waterfall, Chance and Shadow encounter a mountain lion, and much more. Eventually they find Sassy after she is nursed back to health by a birdwatcher. Then their family go back to the farm and find out that the animals are not their. They put of fliers and posters. Then the animals find a missing girl. People come and they are taken to the pound. The family is alerted. Unfortunaley when they get to the pound the animals had escaped. On their way home Shadow falls in a ditch. They go without him. Chance and Sassy get back home. The family is happy, but where is Shadow? The oldest boy Peter, who is Shadow's owner, says that he was too old to make it. Then Shadow comes and it turns out to have a really happy ending.Overall, this is a fantastic heartwarming animal film that any animal lover is bound to enjoy. There are really sad moments in it. For example, when Shadow falls into the ditch, he tries his best to climb up but keeps on slipping back down into the muddy ditch. There also is very heartwarming scenes. For example, when the animals find the lost girl, they comfort her. Shadow then runs across a bridge to alert the adults searching for the girl. I always loved that scene. Anyway, this is a great film, a little too sappy sometimes, but heartwarming and great overall.7/10Recommended Films: The Incredible Journey(Original)",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
38,robert-710-767167,"Not bad at all, it's a great classic!",8,1 May 2012,"On a social networking site, a friend posted a screen cap of a movie with edited captions on it. The movie was of some dogs talking to each other. I looked it up and discovered this movie.I got it and watched it. My younger sister came in halfway and she is very sensitive to movies that are even a little bit scary. To give an example, she cried at the end of Open Season because she didn't think Boog would make it back home and was upset about it.So with that in mind, I watched the movie for the first time. And so I didn't have the nostalgia feeling as many did. But I still enjoyed it and could tell that it could produce that feeling for those growing up. I really liked the plot, the simplicity of the animals speaking (no moving animated mouths or anything) and the music helped to fit in with the theme.I rate this 8/10 for a brilliant movie that deserves a higher rating on IMDb than a 6.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
39,Vimacone,A Great Pet Adventure Film For The Family,10,1 August 2017,"I've always had a fondness for this picture. Nostalgia, heart, and the bond between human and pet are the key factors. You can't go wrong with a heartwarming film like this one especially if you're an animal lover.This is a remake of an earlier Disney film ""The Incredible Journey"". Many elements from that film end up here. In the original version, there is an off screen narrator, who describes what the animals are up to and what they're thinking. In the remake, the animals are given a voice (literally), so the audience has a better connection with the characters, which I think makes the remake stronger in that aspect. This is also one of those animal films where the filmmakers don't make the animals' mouths move via computer, which I also think is a plus, because they're more natural and believable as pets. A voice artist that conveys what the animal is thinking and by its action is all that is necessary, and should be done more often.The score and the scenery also make this a strong film. The pans and shots of the Sierra Nevada are captivating even by today's standards. The scenes of when the animals are in peril are tightly edited. Thankfully, the Animal Humane Society had a hand in those scenes.Remarkably, there have been real life accounts of pets reuniting with their owners after making journeys that took hundreds of miles. Perhaps these kind of stories inspired the source material. The viewer has a strong sense of relief and joy when the pets reunite with their families.I watched both versions growing up (they were released on VHS at the same time) and enjoyed them both, but I prefer the remake, because there is a greater connection and feel for the animal characters. (The original was out of print for several years before being released on DVD in the late 2000's)This film should be enjoyed by the entire family and by dog and cat lovers alike.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

Sally Field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this film as the proud feline, Sassy.

Having experienced the psyche of cats and dogs closely, I enjoyed the depiction.Though cats are not as emotional as Sassy,it feels good to see it that way.Chance is a typical pup which appeals directly due to it's raw innocence.Shadow,on the contrary,adds much of the emotional flavor the movie has.All in all,the movie is a win.Only one sad thing struck my mind - I doubt if the future generations will ever experience an idyllic,artless childhood amidst a calm nature !!!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

48,soymilk,Lively but inferior remake,5,12 May 2005,"In a way, watching 'Homeward Bound: the Incredible Journey' was like a milestone in my own personal viewing experience - it was the first time, that I can remember, I found myself settling down to see a remake of a movie I was already well-familiar with. I was still in primary school when this film hit the screens, but already I knew every scene and character of the charming 1963 classic 'the Incredible Journey' pretty much off by heart. It was a simple but engaging storyline which followed a trio of household pets - an elderly dog named Bodger, a young dog named Lua, and a cat named Tao - as they embarked on a remarkable 200 mile trek across the North American wilderness to be reunited with their owners, learning how to fend for themselves, encountering hostile local wildlife, and maintaining a good close-knit bond with each other all the way.This 90s update follows much the same route, with latter day critters finding themselves in a similar situation and enduring all the obstacles that their forerunners did before them (bears, rivers, porcupines, wild cats), with the odd tweak here and there. The main difference being that they themselves have been given significant makeovers in mind-set, moniker and vocal chords - this time round, Shadow, Chance and Sassy, as they're now known, all sport human voices and, unsurprisingly, more human dispositions. This being a pre-Babe talking critter flick though their mouths don't actually move along with the dialogue being uttered, having it pasted instead on top of their filmed behaviours, a technique which looks more convincing in some scenes than others. And, as good as much of the voice work itself indisputably is (Michael J Fox's charisma never wanes), I'm afraid I have to disagree with most of the comments before me that it actually enhanced their story or characters in any way. Sure, Lua, Tao and Bodger of the original didn't speak, but then again they didn't need to. The animals playing them were expressive and entrancing enough on their own, and had a true naturalistic charm in the sense that they were so believable as a threesome of innocent beings wandering through an environment considerably more vast and intimidating than the one they're used to. They may have lacked the ability to express it in words, but it was evident just how devoted they were to both their owners and each other. Sassy, Chance and Shadow, meanwhile, are more outspoken, but this same unifying sense of friendship and affection is something which they certainly don't pull off. Perhaps because the duration of their journey is marked by so much taunting and bickering amongst themselves, which in turn makes them a tad less appealing as characters - the spitefulness always present in the way that Chance and Sassy interact with each other is especially distracting.The fundamental flaw of 'Homeward Bound' isn't really in the talking itself (which always had the potential to be very charming), but that it rarely uses it as anything more than an opportunity to crank up the comedywhich comes mostly from anal fixations and a harmless but wearisome debate about which of the two species is superior (or rather, which one 'rules' while the other 'drools'), along with lashings of silly lightweight slapstick on the side - basically, things which didn't really bother me the first two or three times I saw it, but which started to grate big time as I got older (as opposed to the infinitely more mature original, which has never outworn its welcome). The fact that one of the dogs has a full understanding of who Arnold Schwarzenegger is probably doesn't help their case.Missing also from this mix is not only the bulk of the original's warmth, but much of the darkness and poignancy too - if anything, the story has been distinctly softened up for this particular telling. While its predecessor was never afraid to get ugly in its depiction of the perils of the natural world that our heroes were fording, 'Homeward Bound' chooses instead to play them up for whatever amusement value they might have - the river-crossing mishap, very fortunately, remains a serious matter, but their confrontations with other animals are sorely lacking in the same bite as before (the way in which Chance and Shadow here deal with a cougar on their trail is embarrassingly cartoony and childish).In the end, what we have here is a lively but pretty routine family film for its decade, and which, as a remake, falls way short of the charm, the adventure and indeed the flavour of its forebear. It will no doubt amuse its intended audience, and I suppose that's half the battle already won. More demanding viewers though will be better off with the genuine article, which trumps it on all counts.Grade: C",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
49,joetulgan,This is my childhood,10,8 January 2021,"Watching this brings me right back to the days of bliss.It's a beautiful movie, beautiful scenery, amazing animals, and of course....Michael J Fox's voice!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
50,spenrh,It's been done better,6,18 May 2019,"I love animals. I love cats and dogs, birds and bears, and I love lambs and sheep. I love films about animals if done in certain ways, one example being ""The bear"" (1989) which showed the life of a bear cub growing up in the Canadian Rockies, through his eyes. And a cat and dog film that I loved was ""The adventures of Milo and Otis"". It showed the adventures of a cat and dog with many heartwarming moments, and without having to add wisecracking and sometimes annoying voiceovers such as in the cat and dogs in ""Homeward bound"".I don't know what exactly caused me to watch an old copy of ""Homeward bound"" again, I guess it's because I love animals. And this movie had some good parts, but the animal films that I mentioned in my first paragraph are definitely better films. ""Homeward bound"" copies too much from the ""Look who's talking"" movies with the babies/toddlers' voice-overs that some people found so cute and hilarious while I just couldn't quite share their enthusiasm. One problem with the ""Look who's talking"" movies and ""Homeward bound"" in my opinion is the over exaggerations of the voice-overs. One example was whenever ""little Mikey"" in ""Look who's talking"" and ""Look who's talking 2"" cried, Bruce Willis' voice-over had to keep whining ""oohhh!! ooohh nooo!! ooohhhh!!"" along with it, something I found a little annoying. There are similarities to that style in ""Homeward bound"", particularly with Michael J. Fox's voice-over with the dog, Chance. One example is when Chance is trying to squeeze under a fence and Fox's voice has to be going ""ooooh god!! ooohhhh nooo!!! ooohhhh!!! ooooohhhhh!!!"". I'm sorry, but Fox's voice-over was annoying, not just his whining but also many lame puns of his like ""you got up on the wrong side of the litter box"", and saying overly excitably ""Aaahhhh!! It's Birdzilla!!"" when seeing a turkey. And other dumb lines like ""I'm too pooped to poop"". The ""dogs rule and cats drool"" line also got old fast, and the same line reversed was also said by the cat Sassy (Sally Field) to Chance, but she wasn't as irritating as Fox's Chance. The one pet character that I liked was the dog Shadow voiced by Don Amache with his wise and noble character voice-over, the least irritating of the 3 pets. Then there's the animal shelter with the catcher chasing the movie's pet heros escaping, and the catcher looking all mean and crazy. I'm sure that was just to make the shelter look like a mean horrible place. None of the staff at the shelter told the pets that their family was coming for them, and that wasn't because they wouldn't talk to the animals. They certainly were talking to them, such as the guy chasing them. They just didn't tell the pets their family was coming so the pets would have the excuse to escape and become lost again, because it was too soon for the movie to be over. In real life, I actually can picture shelter workers telling animals there ""don't worry, your family's coming for you"" if those animals' owners were coming.Now I did give the movie 6 stars, because there were some good things in it. There was the family's loyalty to their pets, the oldest son's bond with the faithful Shadow, and I liked the addition of ""Airplane!'s"" Robert Hays as the father, who also cared for their pets. I liked the scene with Shadow trapped in a muddy ditch and sadly but bravely telling Chance and Sassy ""it's time for you to go on without me"", that kinda tugged at the heartstrings. Also touching was a scene with a little girl lost in the woods with the lost pets keeping her company and safe, and then a tearful reunion with her parents finding her (sitting with the pets) after searching with a search party through the woods all night. Another touching part was seeing Sassy drowning in a river and temporarily being separated from Chance and Shadow, and then turning up ok and bringing heartwarming relief to the 2 dogs.Overall, a movie with both annoying and very good parts.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
51,AW_McGOWAN,Anthropomorphism & Pet Cinema At Its Finest,8,21 December 2020,"I admit that I never read Shelia Burnford's ""The Incredible Journey,"" nor have I seen the 1963 film of the same title. However, I am very familiar with 1993's ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,"" the live-action Disney movie that many would consider the definitive adaptation of this beloved tale.""Homeward Bound"" is a story about three house pets - a wise old Golden Retriever named Shadow (voiced by Don Ameche), an impudent Himalayan cat appropriately named Sassy (voiced by Sally Fields), and a wily young American bulldog named Chance (voiced by Michael J Fox). Each pet belongs to a child in the Seaver family, but when the family makes a temporary move to San Francisco, the kids reluctantly leave their animals at a farm in eastern California.Not understanding that the family is only leaving for a few weeks, the animals grow nervous in their humans' absence. After a few days, they take it upon themselves to escape the farm, cross the Sierra Nevadas, and make ""the incredible journey"" back home. Along the way, they encounter bears, skunks, porcupines, mountain lions, rushing rivers, waterfalls, and the loathsome pound. All the while, the Seavers make efforts to find their beloved pets, but keep on missing them while assuming the worst.Heartwarming, funny, and beautiful, ""Homeward Bound"" just might be the best canine (and feline) movie ever made. All of the voice actors give unparalleled performances, truly capturing the mental and emotional nature of their non-human figures. Perhaps animal psychologists will disagree, but the pet characters behave and think in the exact way we'd expect them to. Their minds are racing with simplistic perspectives, but they show the capacity to learn and all demonstrate undying instincts to protect, love, and reunite with their humans.Much of this effect is thanks to Caroline Thompson and Linda Woolverton: two legendary screenwriters known for crafting family friendly films. In ""Homeward Bound,"" the duo make maximum use of the anthropomorphism to develop melodramatic temporal schemes. Because the animals cannot understand the human language, and vice versa, they constantly misinterpret each other. Therefore, the animals and the humans narrowly miss opportunities for reunion time after time again. Only the audience sees the story from both perspectives, and therefore witnesses it as a constant state of dramatic irony. This provides a highly emotional viewing experience that hits with the upmost elation when things finally fall in place towards the end.Director Duwayne Dunham also deserves high praise for capturing the animal cast in an acutely expressive and naturalistic way. In today's Hollywood, Disney would likely resort to CGI creatures for a movie like this, but ""Homeward Bound"" benefits from its realism. Actual animals filmed on actual, breathtaking locations give the movie an authentic warmth that no virtual simulation could ever rival. Directing humans can oftentimes be painstakingly meticulous, so kudos to Dunham for his patience and perseverance in working across the boundaries of species.Because of ""Homeward Bound's"" realistic approach and its masterful depiction of pet-human relationships, it's a truly timeless movie. While generic and heavily predictable, its conventions are all executed to a masterful degree. Children might seek out ""Homeward Bound"" first, but anyone who loves their pets will reliably tear up watching this wholesome, fun, and uplifting picture.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
52,chucknorrisrules,The incredible story,10,13 April 2009,"SPOILERS ALERTHomeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp. The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel, and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone.The basic story: Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.The three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by Shadow's instincts of direction. They meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. There are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when Sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).Somehow though, I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily. The way that this scene (brilliantly done) isn't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then just as all seems lost, he slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. Chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have as well. Hang on a second, I think I'm going to cry...Anyway, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. But this is a film that all the family can watch, and while the tots will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I found when I watched the film again after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema, and I suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it!And please avoid the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

55,stealth4933,Very Good Film,7,23 July 2008,"I am a fan of animal movies. If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over. Homeward Bound did just this. They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it. It was a complete success. It is very much an archetypal movie. You have the obi-wan of the group(shadow) who is wise and logical, you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Chance, and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities bounce off of each other very well. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters, and they did not overdue it. Most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film. What they are forgetting, however, is that it is supposed to be a kids film, and this still does not take away from the acual movie. This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie. It is a Disney movie without the cartoons, an air bud movie with a better plot. I would, without a doubt, advise you to watch it.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
56,Angel-Shadow,A film you can watch when your feeling down. ''A story about courage adventure and friendship.'',10,26 September 2005,"I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film, which i will come to later. For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15), I dug out the VHS of homeward bound. After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground, something that you all need. The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever, looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog, with sassy the clever, vulnerable but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return, when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy, painfully are told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

The dogs and cats in this movie are remarkable. I had no idea that a cat could be trained to do some of the things that Sassy did in this movie. It is amazing.Three pets are left for an owner of a farm to take care of when the family is away. After a couple of days and the owners do not come back because it would take more time to get back to the farm than they thought the animals go on a journey to find home again. They encounter perils. Bears, waterfalls, and mountain lions. They are found by people. They are sent by to the pound. Their family finds that out. When they go to pick them out the animals break out to get home. The family goes back home. In the end the animals get back to their house.This is one of the best live-action Disney films out there.9/10",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
58,rockndaparadise,Very well made! Recommended for all!,9,8 September 2005,"This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It's a real pleaser to anyone. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense.Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time I crack up when watching this movie, it's because of Chance; it's like the comedy never ends! This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

It's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart.There aren't any other live animal movies that I can think of at the moment that I even could compare with, let alone like as much as this one.

It's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak, and with a little drama to keep you on your toes. A true family film, Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way. One of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and watching him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment. Chance - who wouldn't love a dog like Chance? He's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper; 'Here kitty kitty kitty... not on your life, chubby.' There were also lots of well made emotional scenes, such as Sassy going over the waterfall (I was truly scared for her), Shadow falling in the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic ending, when all three pets return home... including good old Shadow! A favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals.

Betcha never thought they feel the same way about you!Wonderful, wonderful family film. If you have a soft spot for animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a little kid, and I find that now, at age sixteen, I love it as much as I did then. I could never decide on a favorite character then, and I still don't think I can! I love all three of the animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving, but feuding family. I do love Chance, and how at the end he says that he has a family at last. Cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film, and it fulfills that role perfectly. Sassy has just the perfect dose of ""sassiness"" and Shadow is the perfect leader/role model to the young, adventurous Chance.The animals way outshine the humans, but of course most of the teary moments are to be had during an interaction with them (ie. rescuing Molly, and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion, and an accompanying heart-swelling feeling. I give this 9/10.

There's a couple scenes that always get me though.First is when Shadow barks at the little lost girl's search party and helps guide them to her. Makes me teary eyed just thinking about it.Second one is towards the end of the movie when Shadow falls through the old wood into the pit & can't get out, and then what happens afterwards, which I won't say because it would definitely be a spoiler.

As a kid it was fun and entertaining, but everytime I watch it as an adult it's overwhelming with emotional tears of sadness and joy. I suspect low ratings probably come from the fact that being 1993, the animals speech is voiceover rather than moving their mouths through special effects, but I think it's more genuine this way, because the interaction between the humans and animals isn't manipulated. If you're a pet lover, and especially dog owner, then this movie will make you appreciate your dog much more.

69,miles-husoy,You're never too old,9,19 October 2013,"My sister had a VHS copy years and years ago, but our mom got rid of it feeling we had outgrown it. Maybe in adolescence, she was right. Fast forward to 10+ years later and I decide to check a DVD copy out of the library just for old times' sake for no real reason. Prior to now (I'm a 27-year-old single man), I have discovered lots of movies I was too young to see circa 1993...A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs, The Terminator, Road Trip...OK, that movie didn't come out 'til 2000 and it's not an absolute classic like the first three, but you get the idea! I popped the movie into my player this evening to see if the movie held up. And wouldn't you know it...it does! In fact, I cried so much at the end, my ears are still moist half an hour after it ended.Truth be told, however, the first few minutes are pretty stupid, but it does show Chance and Sassy's resentment to one another, which is important to the story. The real magic comes when the three animals (especially Chance) realize what home and family really means when their child owners leave them on a farm. That's when they decide to make their escape and from there, it's an adventure that may be dangerous, but in the words of Sassy, ""I laugh at danger."" The most touching scenes are Sassy finding her way back to Chance and Shadow after she was rescued from being drowned and Shadow finding the lost Molly in the woods. The touching musical score from Bruce Broughton is also a major factor.I'd like to note I work with pets sometimes, so I know how it would feel if one of them (or even all of them) just disappeared. My family's favourite cat died of old age in July 2011. As you can imagine, I was heartbroken, but at that time, I was sharing a house with a middle-aged couple who had two shihtzus, so before I went out to do my errands that day, I made sure to say hello to the two little dogs because although one of my family pets was gone, I had two other ones who could be a beacon of hope for me.No matter how old you are or what your tastes are or if you generally can't stand anything that comes from Disney, you seriously must see this film and you'll feel redeemed that way.

71,slmcorrigan,The feels are real.,8,10 February 2019,"If you're up for tear wrenching, heart crunching adventure about the best pals we as humans can have. Then this film is for you.
Very good at getting even the most hard boiled egg to sweat a little from their eyes!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
72,michael-gillanders1,This movie rules!,10,19 February 2004,"Homeward Bound is a beautiful film. Y'know the part where Shadow falls down the ditch... thingy, I *cried*, considering I was only six, I cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained. A nice family movie, *not* for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animal-haters but could for soft-as-crap a.k.a. people like me.
A good film overall, 10/10!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
73,joshbutters,One of my favorites,10,9 February 2007,"This is a really cool movie! I remember first seeing it when I was really young and I used to watch it all the time like once a week...Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things. Parts of the movie are sad though (such as when Sassy, the cat, falls down the waterfall, and when Shadow falls in the hole at the end.) I have seen the second Homeward Bound but I gotta say its not as good as the first. Shadow is the smart one, Sassy is, well, Sassy, and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies, or talking animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
74,hfreeburg,BEST MOVIE EVER,10,19 January 2019,"Michael J Fox crushes as the voice of Chance, saying memorable lines I still quote as a 31 year old adult and if the ending doesn't make you cry you're a sociopath. It's in he DSM-V.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
75,z3ph,The most heart-warming tale of courageous friends trying to get home,10,19 February 2007,"There have been countless talking-animal films in the past, the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting, or are ridiculously amateur. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is neither.This film doesn't need the infant-pleasing addition of moving canine lips, or gesturing feline limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another, and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart (as all great boy-and-and-his-dog films should).Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal romps to me, and boasts some beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from the genius of Bruce Broughton), and an impressive cast...Michael J. Fox ... ChanceSally Field ... SassyDon Ameche ... ShadowFrank Welker (Voice God) ... VariousIt is a modernised version of the children's classic work of fiction 'The Incredible Journey', which was made into a semi-documentary film by Disney long long ago in 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Fransisco) isn't nearly as good a film, but extends the adventure of my favourite furry-footed friends, and is a fun urban-twist on the grand-outdoor-adventure theme. Want to entertain your children with a witty, pretty, heart-warming mini-epic, without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three films for your children - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time I watch this early-90s classic!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
76,goddess-60586,The best,10,23 October 2020,This is the sweetest dog lovers movie ever made. Each animal is represented so well. The story is amazing. I highly recommend this movie.,Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
77,Spiderman326128,One of the most Heart-Warming Funny Lovable Films About Animals EVER!!,10,11 January 2004,"Maybe I'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes out. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. Don't worry they're tears of happiness! And it's not all sap! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. My only word of advice: Even if you love this-Don't see the sequal...cornyness! I suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
78,swetpi,Awesome!,10,27 January 2005,"This movie was awesome...it made me laugh, it make a bawl, and most of all it has talking animals in it!! this movie should be seen by all kinds of people! it is one of my favorite movies, and i just love it so much that i just had to comment on it!!!it rox! it is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a great and heartfelt movie!my favorite character is shadow. this is because i think that he is the most interesting and charming. i used to have a golden retriever just like shadow, i miss him so much!!! he was my best friend and i knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but i miss him with all of my heart!! this movie is the best i love it and everyone should! Love your pets no matter what they do, cherish them forever!!!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
79,rogue_McGregor,Wonderful,10,2 August 2005,"I watch this movie all the time. I've watched it with family ages 3 to 87, and everyone in between; They all loved it. It really shows the true scenes a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful.It's great for thoes who love comedy movies, the tear-jerker movies, or even just pets.The music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes truly thought out, and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities: Shadow (The oldest, a Golden Retriever) He's the wise one, filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog, Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comical character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
80,arachnocat,Good Movie,8,18 September 2017,"Overall, a good movie.A very sad and sweet, slightly cheesy movie about a cat and 2 dogs.It is a great family movie and will probably make you all laugh and cry.This, in my opinion is the sign of a very good movie.I was just slightly disappointed that the movie did not include the song of the same title (Homeward Bound) by Simon & Garfunkel in the soundtrack or the credits.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
81,queenalucy,My All-Time Favorite Movie,10,23 February 2001,"It surprises me how much I love this movie despite the fact that I don't really like dogs. Fox, Field, and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing.I have seen this movie 72 times already (I know that sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time the ending scenes still get me. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. It is indeed my all-time favorite movie!",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey

Could You please help me and tell me where i can buy it from. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favourite movie wen i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager. It is a great movie for the whole family. My entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it. I love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on DVD.Sally",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
83,jackschild,Wow,10,6 October 2021,"This movie brings back so many memories. It gives me such a great nostalgic feeling. I watched it for the first time when I was about 5 or 6, and I loved it. I still watch it every few months/years to feel that nostalgia again, and I have never stopped enjoying it. I'm serious, i have now grown a bit (I'm 15 years old) but when I watch it it's like im a little kid again, watching the movie with excitement and watching as if I have no idea what's going to happen. It's such a great movie.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
84,david-grace63,Being a child in the 90's this is one of my most memorable films.,10,1 January 2009,"I watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue. And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. However watching it now I can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was. But i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image in yellow. And and bearing in mind it is a children's film, that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
85,jeandewey,A wonderful movie for all generations,10,19 August 2012,I first saw this movie when my children were young in the early 80's. Now 30 years later I am enjoying it again with my granddaughter. For a two year old she sits spellbound through it from beginning to end. She is always concerned when Shadow falls from the railroad tracks in to the mud and cant get out and encourages him to keep trying. My favorite scene is the suspense building as you wait for the animals to come in to view in the end and return to their owners. Waiting for Shadow to make his appearance always has the tears running down my cheeks. I know he is going to make it but it is still an emotional scene as he gains speed running to his owner. I had to order this movie to add to my granddaughters collection.,Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
86,spokaneb1004,Horrible; an animal movie without animals,1,2 December 2016,"This movie is a remake of the 1963 original, which was based on a popular children's book ""The Incredible Journal"". The story concerns two dogs and a cat which leave a temporary boarding home and journey through a wilderness to their family home. The contrast between the original and this remake illustrates the change from viewing animals as animals and viewing them as funny shaped people. The original had a narrator, who filled in on the animal's motivations as needed. The events of the story, while implausible for a single set of animals in a small time span, were each individually reasonable. In the remake, the animals talk. (Spoiler: animals can't talk.) They reason and act like humans. Many of their actions are implausible. This is a good movie for children if all you want is an expanded cartoon like fantasy world. But if you want a movie about real creatures worthy of the love and respect we give our pets, stick to the original.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
87,mayerismine88,My Favorite Childhood Movie,10,19 February 2005,"This is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow yelling ""Wait, wait for me Peter!"" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must see if you love animals! Best Movie Ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; ""Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six I bet I loved that line. The storyline may seem hooky to some, but I like it. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in ""Homeward Bound.""",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
88,Barricade_Girl,"A beautiful movie, with excellent acting.",9,14 April 2005,"As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. Based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what, maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it isn't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that ... yeah, everyone go watch it.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
89,sklinetob,Good Movie but NOT for sensitive children,7,28 August 2021,"This is a sweet movie with themes of friendship, perseverance, love, loyalty and dedication. It is comedic and heartwarming, completely clean, and ultimately everything works out well in the end. However, the scenes of peril for two of the main animal characters are entirely too realistic, with gaps that are too long between the apparent death/loss of each of those two main animal characters and the ultimate happy reunion/resolution for each. Some suspense is important for storytelling, but this was entirely too much for a young, or even older, more sensitive child.",Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey
