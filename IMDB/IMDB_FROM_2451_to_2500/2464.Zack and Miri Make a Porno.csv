0,SnoopyStyle,raunchy sex romp rom-com,7,15 June 2015,"Miri (Elizabeth Banks) and Zack (Seth Rogen) are lifelong loser friends in the Pittsburgh outer burbs. They're broke and the water is shut off. At the high school reunion, Miri tries to hook up with school crush Bobby Long (Brandon Routh) but his gay boyfriend Brandon St. Randy (Justin Long) tells Zack that they're gay porn stars. A couple of teens secretly filmed Miri in her granny pantie and the video goes viral. Zack and a reluctant Miri agrees to make a porno with friends like Delaney (Craig Robinson) to make some money.It's raunchy vulgarity going further than Apatow. Kevin Smith is trying to hit a narrow target of sweet rom-com and raunchy sex romp. The best parts are the great comic actors Banks, Rogen and the rest of the cast. Although, it's hard to see Banks as a loser. Maybe she needs to be smoking lots of pot to fit the role. Rogen fits the lovable loser role like a glove. There are some awkwardness with the subject matter although the porn video names are funny.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
1,Prismark10,Coming out,6,9 May 2015,"Director Kevin Smith makes a slacker buddy porn comedy in Zack and Miri make a Porno. Zack and Miri are good friends living in a run down flat and not having enough money to pay the rent and bills and decide to make a porn film to roll in the cash, an idea they got after they met a former school friend at a High School reunion who revealed he was a gay porn star.Smith makes the film rude and crude but deep inside is a sweet love story as Zack and Miri find out that they have a romantic tingling for each other which is more than just sex for the camera.The film is amusing enough helped by the good chemistry between Elizabeth Banks and Seth Rogen although the film is prudish showing nude scenes with Banks. Craig Robinson provides amusing support. There are enough pop culture references and Smith regulars popping up to keep his fans happy.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
2,claudio_carvalho,"A Love Story, by Kevin Smith",8,24 January 2009,"The losers Zack Brown (Seth Rogen) and Miriam ""Stinky"" Linky (Elizabeth Banks) are friends since high-school and share an apartment with many unpaid bills. In a reunion party, they find that the former high-school star and crush of Miri is a porn actor of gay movies and they decide to make a porn to pay their bills. They cast the actors, actresses and crew, and Zack writes the screenplay. After having sex with Miri in the shooting, the platonic love of Zack changes to a deep love.""Zack and Miri Make a Porn"" is the nearest that I could expect from Kevin Smith for a love story or a romantic comedy. And it works perfectly! The story has many jokes, and Tracy Lords acting as Bubbles is hilarious considering the background of the beginning of the career of this charming actress. In spite of being a fan of Kevin Smith, this movie overcame my expectations. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
3,gavin6942,A Nice Rebound From Smith's Lower Works,7,1 March 2009,"Lifelong platonic friends Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) look to solve their respective cash-flow problems by making an adult film together. As the cameras roll, however, the duo begin to sense that they may have more feelings for each other than they previously thought. This is a welcome addition to the Kevin Smith filmography. ""Clerks II"" was a sad follow-up for ""Clerks"", and while ""Jersey Girl"" was enjoyable, it was still not one of his better movies and people seem to agree with that assessment. We will probably never see Smith in his prime again -- ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy"" quality -- but this was a nice attempt.The over-arching humor of this film revolves around sex and sexual situations (duh) and is heavily reliant on crude humor and vulgarity. Yet, unlike sophomoric comedies like ""American Pie"", there is an underlying intelligence here that can be appreciated by those with more refined tastes. Where Smith may have lost his wit, he has not lost his intelligence.A stand-out moment is a scene featuring Justin Long. Long, who typically comes off as a straight nerd (see ""Dodgeball"" or ""Live Free or Die Hard"" or almost anything else) does a fine job as a gay porn star here, giving the audience some of their deepest laughs throughout the picture. His voice is funny, and his ""straight"" delivery of lines (no pun intended) really adds some depth. The character is Stephen Wright meets George Carlin.Other reviewers have said they are getting sick of Seth Rogen, and let me say I tend to agree. I do not mind Rogen, and think he is a funny guy (though not the funniest), but I do have to wonder why every comedy today features him or Will Ferrell. The variety is lacking and for those of us who watch movies on a semi-regular basis, we might be feeling overwhelmed. I have heard the suggestion that Jason Bateman might have filmed the role of Zack, and that seems like a worthwhile suggestion...I would recommend this film to Smith fans. If you like it, you might see where I am coming from on wanting to give Smith a second chance. If you do not like it, you may find his career is dead. At the very least, let us hope we do not see ""An Evening with Kevin Smith 3"", since the second was no more than a pale imitation of the first and I cannot see the third being any better. (Review update 2014: a third part happened, which I have not seen.)",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
4,BA_Harrison,Romance and porn are like oil and water: they just don't mix.,4,21 February 2009,"When I heard that Kevin Smith was making a comedy about pornos, it seemed such an obvious thing for him to tackle: here's a guy who clearly loves his hardcore (judging from the infamous video shop scene in Clerks), can write butt-clenchingly funny dialogue, and actually has the balls to be as shocking as necessary to do the subject justice.Alas, now that I've finally seen it, I've gotta say I'm very disappointed: rather than making an outrageous side-splitter littered with pop culture references and porn stars, Smith's given us a bloody rom-com - albeit one littered with pop culture references and porn stars.In Zack and Miri Make A Porno, Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks play Zack Brown and Miriam Linky, a cash-strapped pair of platonic friends who decide that the best way to solve their financial problems is to make a porno film. Whilst this is undoubtedly a promising premise that offers all manner of smutty scenarios to which Smith can apply his particular brand of humour, the writer/director decides to go all gooey on us and has his characters discover that their feelings for each other go deeper than they thought. Sentimental romance coupled with gags about anal sex: it's an unlikely combo that just doesn't work.In order to make his sweet and fluffy romantic angle succeed, Smith is forced to cheat his audience, who are expected to believe that when it comes to Zack and Miri's big scene, the camera would stay 15 feet from where the action is and never zoom in for a close-up. It's manipulative cobblers and makes a farce of the whole film.In future, Smith really should cut out the sentimental bull from his scripts and concentrate on delivering the laughs, because when he's on form, his work is hilarious (as Justin Long and Brandon Routh's scenes together go to prove).",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
5,moonspinner55,"Rude, ribald insults and put-downs make queasy bedfellows with Smith's idea of romantic sentiments...",3,20 August 2011,"Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks play platonic roommates in Pittsburgh, best friends since grade school who think of each other practically as brother and sister, who can't afford to pay their rent and utilities on their measly salaries. Hiring a buddy to finance a sex flick, they hope to get into the lucrative porno business--but discover to their surprise they share deep-rooted romantic feelings for one another after having sex for the first time. Written and directed by Kevin Smith, this is a modern-day, plain-spoken comedy of no particular merit, but a great many profane, politically-incorrect put-downs and sight-gags. Smith has concocted a funny set-up--and with willing players--but ""Zack and Miri"" is a one-act comedy with nowhere to turn after the first forty or so minutes. Just when the audience expects the comic ideas to be heightened, the film comes crashing down in a sea of character implausibilities and uncomfortable sentiment. Gross-out jokes can certainly be partnered with sweet sensibilities if the handling is right, but nothing in the film's first-half prepares us for what transpires. Rogen and Banks end up portraying completely different people, a couple who don't even need to appear in their own production (they've already hired a cast). When a comedy makes no logical or emotional sense, nothing else in it has a hope in hell of succeeding. *1/2 from ****",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
6,Quinoa1984,"funny, gooey, predictable, outrageous, gleeful, nostalgic, warm, romantic... did I say gooey?",7,11 November 2008,"These are some words I would describe for Kevin Smith's latest film not quite from his 'Viewaskewniverse' (if that's really a word), only this time out of New Jersey and in Pittsburgh (acually, the Dawn of the Dead cit Monroeville home of the Monroeville mall, an hockey of course). It is in all basic terms about the title character doing what it says... doing it, and filming it and filming other people doing it with a little camcorder in the place where the two intrepid 20-somethings (Zack, Seth Rogen, Miri, Eizabeth Banks) work. But it is also about Kevin Smith, making a very ridiculous and profane and occasionally (appropriately) gross movie while at the same time also delivering something, well, personal. He gets to have his cake and eat it, while also indulging towards the end in some more romantic-type stuff to fill out the ending.Not that we don't want to see these two characters falling in love and spending together together - on paper. On screen, however, Smith is cribbing (as maybe too many critics have noted) from the Judd Apatow school of comedy. And it's not simply with the casting of Rogen, one of Apatow's sacred bunch of super-talented average-Joe funny-men. It's in what is, t me, something of a sitcom-type of conceit with a man like Rogen, who is not bad looking or ugly but approximately what he appears to be, and pairing him with a very attractive blonde - first, Katheine Heigl, now Elizabeth Banks. One could go on about wanting to see more of a realistic scenario, with Miri not being a super-hot girl but more... s***, 'realistic.' How cruel that may or may not sound I don't know, but by the third act, which does contain some of Smith's most (succesful) romantic dialog since Chasing Amy, doesn't carry the same weight if just because of that notion of a funny/chubby shlub together with a... well, Elizabeth Banks.And yet, for its predictability and moments of pure schmaltz, Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a funny movie, sometimes incredibly funny movie, because Smith has it in him to know what works for not just his own skills as a filmmaker but for his audience. He is, as others have also noted, a kind of Woody Allen for his time, in a sense, which is that Kevin Smith likes to live the life of Kevin Smith and make Kevin Smith movies. Not many can write with both wit and crudeness equally and make it work; sometimes only one on its own will do. But just watch, in a slight throwback to Clerks, the montage of Zack and Mirir trying to come up with porno-movie title names, leading up to 'Star Whores'. Or what makes for half of the flat-out most uproarious scene in the whole running time with Justin Long and Brandon Rouths' characters (Long especially shows how brilliant he can be in the right setting). Or even throwaway scenes with Jason Mewes- yes, he can play someone other than Jay, very well.It's all, in any approximation, good stuff. At the least, for the first half, before it becomes more or less emphasized with romance and conflict of the variety one isn't unfamiliar with in Chasing Amy territory (if only slightly less mature and a tidy ending). It isn't one of the best of Smith's now 8 films since Clerks, but as far as Smith movies go it's true and fun and occasionally deep, which is what counts with a Gen-X auteur like him. 7.5/10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

8,Scarecrow-88,Zach and Miri Make a Porno,7,1 May 2010,"Zach and Miri(Seth Rogen & Elizabeth Banks)have been best friends throughout high school and their adult lives and need money to pay the rent, power, water, and other bills so, inspired by specific events(Miri is shot by two juveniles in her ""granny panties"" with a phone camera; Zach and Miri meet a male gay porno star from LA, portrayed by Justin Long, who is currently the boyfriend of the former star quarterback, for whom they meet at a high school reunion)decide to make a porno movie as a means to survive. Yes, these two share an apartment, talk to each other openly about sexual matters with no degree of awkwardness or difficulty(they have a ""meaningful"" discussion about ordering sexual pleasure machines on Amazon.com), and drive a crappy car together to work every morning in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. So, these two do just that, having to set up shop in the local Starbucks rip off coffee shop late at nights with an assembled cast and crew. What Zach and Miri didn't expect was to fall in love after performing in front of the camera together for the first time. Kevin Smith, to me, was a holdover from the raunchy 80's before Judd Apatow started receiving all his critical accolades and I think he hasn't lost any of his skill to present potty-mouth characters saying the most audacious things laced with tons of filthy sex-related humor. I think ""Zach and Miri.."" is for those who are not offended by Smith's brand of humor which doesn't refrain from sexually explicit detail/content..the movie is about porno and has a cast of characters who deal with this unabashedly, not ashamed of the idea of starring in such a movie as a way to earn cash. Smith has lost none of his ability to create completely unique characters even if they are centered around a polarizing topic. Shooting the movie in such a dreary, cold Pittsburgh during winter is an interesting choice by Smith and he casts it effectively particularly in the principles. Rogan can swear and say his lines without a hitch and Banks, to her credit, doesn't exactly hold back, either. They have surprisingly wonderful chemistry, although the storyline involving their characters' decision to appear in and create a porno movie will be certain to alienate those who might otherwise embrace an unusual romantic coupling. Smith regular Jason Mewes appears as a star in Zach and Miri's porno, and even flashes his junk for the viewer in one particular scene towards the end. Craig Robinson is Rogan's pal/co-worker who helps produce their little movie, and must contend with a loud, confrontational wife who nags him all the time. Banks is enchanting. While the dialogue is heavy with porno and sexually explicit subject matter, the film shows precious little actual nudity or lewd acts, which might disappoint those expecting some action on screen.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
9,preppy-3,Turns into a conventional romance but very funny and profane most of the time,8,24 May 2010,"Life-long platonic friends Zack (Seth Rogan) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have trouble paying their rent and their utility bills. To make ends meet they decide to make a porn film. Naturally things go wrong left and right.VERY funny and dirty comedy. It's a Kevin Smith movie so characters swear non-stop and there's some fairly explicit sex (all within an R rating though). The plot is more than a little silly but the movie is full of some very funny sequences and interesting characters. I was really surprised to see Brandon Routh (the latest Superman) and Justin Long playing a gay couple who do porno. They're only in two parts but they're a riot. It also seems that Routh is fighting not to laugh out loud at Long's lines. Also former porn actress Traci Lords has a part and Jason Mewes (looking a LOT different from his other movies) plays an actor AND shows full frontal. The best acting comes from Banks and Rogen who have to carry the whole film...but they're up for it. They attack their parts with gusto and good spirits. Two excellent performances. The script and direction are very good too. However it cops out a little at the end and makes a sharp detour and becomes very conventional (unfortunately). Still this is worth seeing.Avoid it you're offended by swearing, sexually explicit dialogue and fairly graphic simulated sex. But, if you can handle all this, you'll probably love this. This gets an 8 only because of it turning from a profane comedy into a romance.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
10,dbborroughs,Better than the title suggests,7,19 January 2009,"Sweet and funny vulgar love story about two friends forever who only realize they love each other when they finally sleep together for a porno film they are making to pay the rent. The first couple of minutes had me groaning, wondering what I had gotten myself into but somehow it all come together and the repartee between the two leads won me over. Its an utterly charming film with four letter words and talk about adult toys. What can I say I've finally found a Seth Rogen film I like. I can only chalk up its less than stellar performance to the title. Yes you really do what to see this. 7.5 out of 10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
11,zardoz-13,A Wonderfully Sweet & Sour Romantic Comedy About the Making of a Porno,10,5 November 2008,"""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is ""Clerks"" director Kevin Smith's best blue-collar, romantic comedy since ""Chasing Amy."" The eponymous protagonists have been best friends since the first grade who make a porno to pay off their overdue rent and utility bills during chilly Thanksgiving in Pittsburgh. Zack and Miri live together in the same apartment, but they sleep in separate rooms and in separate beds. In other words, they don't have sex. They share the rent and the utilities, alternating who pays what each month. Clearly, if you're a prude about sex and profanity, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" will probably offend you with its alphabet soup of A-words, C-words, F-words, and s-words that pervade the dialogue. The first funny gag in ""Zack and Miri"" involves the use of those palm-sized chemical packets that provide warmth when the user kneads them with their hands. Miri (Elizabeth Banks of ""W."") breaks out one as she awaits Zack (Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up"") to join her as she drives them to work. Zack snatches the chemical packet from Miri and unceremoniously stuffs it into his trousers. Later, as they drive to work, Miri smells something toasty and poor Zack realizes that his genitals are heating up and struggles to remove the packet. Miri has to pull off the road and Zack has to shed his coat to get the packet out of his crotch. When he claims that the packet has burned his hairy testicles, Miri laughs at the absurdity of it all. The action finally cranks up when our protagonists attend their high school reunion. Miri is dressing for the occasion in the back room at the coffee shop called ""Bean'N Gone"" where Zack works as a counter attendant. Two slackers see Miri changing out of her clothing and freak at the granny panties that Miri has on. No sooner have they video-taped Miri's derrière than Zack walks in front of their cell phone camera and moons them. Anyway, Miri wants to hook up with former high school football player and all-around jock, Bobby Long (Brandon Routh of ""Superman Returns""), while Zack cruises the party. Zack runs into Brandon (Justin Long of ""Live Free or Die Hard"") and learns that Brandon is attending the festivities with his homosexual lover. Brandon explains to Zack that he is a gay male porno star and that he is rolling in dough. Predictably, Miri reacts with shock when she discovers Bobby's sexual orientation. Our heroine and hero leave the reunion and go back to their apartment. Since Zack forgot to pay the light bill because he had to buy a pair of ice hockey skates, our heroine and hero find themselves plunged into darkness. Miri observes over a brew at a nearby bar that their predicament is what forces some people to prostitute themselves or appear in a porno. Since neither Zack nor Miri have any living relatives, they are not ashamed to flaunt their sex organs. Our protagonists decide to make a porno movie in the hopes that the over 800 people in their high school graduating class will buy a copy for twenty dollars a DVD. Zack approaches his fellow employee, Delaney (Craig Robinson), about serving as the producer. Delaney scraps his dream of buying a big-screen TV so he can finance Zack's porno. Delaney, who is married to an abrasive woman with sagging breasts, perks up when he realizes that he gets to ogle breasts during actress auditions. The first male that they hire is none other than Kevin Smith's co-hort in his ""Jay and Silent Bob"" comedies. Zack and Miri chose Lester (Jason Mewes) solely on the basis that he can attain an erection in no time. Later, Lester saunters around in the nude with his beans and franks hanging out for all to see. Notorious real-life former teen porn star Traci Lords of ""Blade"" plays a character called ""Bubbles"" who farts into a soap-blowing loop and makes bubbles. Yes, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" has frontal nudity but the sexual exploits are clearly simulated. Nude bar hostess Stacy (Katie Morgan of ""Hot Cherry Pies 3"") displays her ample breasts in one scene with Lester as our heroes videotape after hours in their workplace. They lose their first studio because a huckster named Jenkins (make-up artist Tom Savini of ""Night of the Living Dead"") took a month's rent from them but neglected to tell them that the building that houses their studio is scheduled to be destroyed. Our resourceful protagonists decide to relocate the setting of their porno to the coffee shop after everyone has gone for the evening.If profane, randy, politically-incorrect language about sex offends you, then you should skip ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" Seth Rogan is perfectly cast as a wise-acre coffee shop server who has a deep crush on Miri and their romantic involvement in each other takes on a different light when they shoot their own porno. Each is so self-conscious about themselves and absorbed in each other that they forget to remove their clothing. Miri realizes that she has found true love at long last. Smith shoots this scene with an overhead camera as Miri sprawls out on coffee bean sacks. It almost looks like a homage to a similarly shot scene in Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" when Claudia Cardinale laid back on a huge bed with a gauzy canopy.The usual problems that occur when two people become intimate create complications that drive them apart and force them to shutdown the movie. Despite the formulaic plot, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is a sweet, sometimes profanely sour, sentimental romantic plot as the wacky way that love works. The 'Dutch rudder' scene between Seth Rogen and Jason Mewes is hilarious.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
12,grantss,Good return to form for Kevin Smith,7,25 January 2016,"A fine return to form for Kevin Smith. After making one of the greatest debut movies of all time, Clerks, he then made some very good features, in Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma. What followed was distinctly lacklustre - Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Jersey Girl, Clerks II. This puts him back on track.Very funny, the dialogue is snappy and fresh. While the movie is a comedy, it is great. It is a pity that Smith took the romance angle too seriously, as the romantic plot is fairly lame, and has too much weight. If it had been 100% comedy, it would have been fantastic.Good acting by Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks, plus a great over-the- top performance by Craig Robinson.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

14,neil-476,Great fun for the broad minded,8,20 November 2008,"I'm 56, and I grew up at a time and in a place where sexual matters were not the sort of things which got mentioned in private company. And the F-word was utter taboo, a complete no-no. Like all of us, I'm a product of my background, which is one of the reasons why I have mixed feelings about Kevin Smith. I've liked a lot of what he's done, and I totally understand both the use of language for dramatic effect, and also the use of speech patterns for dialogue authentication (in Platoon, for instance, the bad language fulfilled both ends). Smith's movies, however, tend to be filled with expletives because effing Smith effing likes it that effing way. Well, I don't, sorry - I like my foul language to serve a purpose.And, in Zack and Miri, it does. The plot, for those who have yet to learn anything about it, concerns Zack and Miri, friends since childhood, who platonically share an apartment and have no money. Once their utilities are cut off Zack comes up with the idea of making a homemade porno movie in order to make money - this would mean Zack and Miri having sex, but he's confident that this won't change their relationship. But, of course, it does...It's a bit naive to expect a film on this particular subject matter, and in which a moderate part of the running time is devoted to the making of the movie, not to have any bad language. So be warned, it's full of it. Possibly the most foul-mouthed movie ever made.But I didn't care, because the characters are all so likable (I contrast this with Easy Virtue, a comedy/drama released around the same time, clean as a whistle, and filled with unpleasant characters). Zack and Miri and their friends are nice people to be around, and this comes from someone who doesn't particularly like Seth Rogen.It also helps that the movie is funny, sometimes very much so. There is one particular gag which is the most disgusting joke I have ever seen in a public cinema, and I'm ashamed to say that I laughed out loud for some considerable time, as did the remainder of the (young and fairly female) audience. Justin Long - who continues to impress me with his range as a performer - has a short but wonderfully funny sequence.The film is predicated on a double standard - the promiscuity inherent in pornos is good fun, right up until the moment when it becomes personal - and this issue remains unresolved. I don't know if this is a problem or not - I suspect that it may be more of a problem for women than men, but perhaps I'm simply indulging in ageist sexual stereotyping! I also felt that it was improbable that the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks would drop her drawers for Rogen, childhood friend and money problems notwithstanding, unless she had severe self-esteem problems . But that might be my own self-esteem problems talking....But I enjoyed this film a lot and, if you are broad-minded, give it a go.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
15,anaconda-40658,Rogen and Banks Make a Kevin Smith Film.,7,24 September 2015,"Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008): Dir: Kevin Smith / Cast: Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Craig Robinson, Traci Lords, Jason Mewes: Comedy that addresses the amateur quality of porn flicks. Seth Rogan and Elizabeth Banks play roommates who resort to making a porn flick when they are threatened with a possible eviction. It is obvious that this couple will eventually surface their true feelings resulting in a conventional ending. Great idea directed with insight by Kevin Smith but it doesn't rank with his best work, which includes Chasing Amy, Clerks and Clerks 2. Rogen and Banks have great comic potential and here is a script with promising originality and rather than poke fun of the amateur quality of it all, they will do the obvious, which is tease viewers with romantic elements that were in plain sight to begin with. The ending is also a cheap payoff where certain people end up in certain places with lame explanations to clear everything up. Scene stealing supporting work by Craig Robinson who works at a coffee shop and is bullied by his wife. He has a hilarious scene where he audition actors. Traci Lords plays a porn actress with a knack for bubbles. Jason Mewes also makes a terrific stretch from his usual Jay persona to playing a porno star stripper with attitude.

16,zetes,Kevin Smith's schtick gets a little tiring in this one,6,3 May 2009,"Pretty typical Kevin Smith movie: filthy and profane, but ultimately sweet and a little charming. Overall, though, I didn't think it was among his better films. I would never choose to rewatch it. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks star as high school buddies who room together in a dingy apartment. Their bills are piling up, and after losing water and power, they decide to make a porno to make money. They are not lovers, just friends. They've never had sex with each other, but the prospect of money makes it intriguing. They also hire a bunch of other Kevin Smith-esquire goofballs to help them. The central story isn't half bad, but Kevin Smith, always a rather poor writer and director, does it badly. Neither Banks nor Rogen are natural. It's weird that Rogen doesn't seem to fit - this isn't that far off any of the other roles he's played. Banks definitely sticks out like a sore thumb. It's never believable that someone who look likes her could end up such a loser. And it's not just that she's pretty - co-stars Traci Lords and Katie Morgan are bona fide porn stars. Both are gorgeous, but Elizabeth Banks has class. A better writer and director could have mined the emotional tension between Rogen and Banks. Smith mostly fails. What makes the film watchable is the supporting cast. Craig Robinson is an actor who, in my opinion, can do no wrong. He's the kind of character actor you get excited for when you see he's in a movie. Jason Mewes, famous as Jay from Kevin Smith's other movies, plays one of the porno actors. He's extremely funny. He's always been one of the best things about Kevin Smith movies.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Zack and Miri Make A Porno,8,30 November 2008,"If I may sound like a prude, it's been a while since I laughed so hard and so loud at and with a comedy, given that most have been relatively lacklustre flicks of late. And it took a Kevin Smith one to do just that, with its unadulterated, no holds barred treatment of material where anything and everything goes, where there's no such thing as taboos to be avoided, and somehow, the more vulgar the merrier, as this is definitely one unapologetic movie. You have been warned.Yes, some may laud this beast as a travesty, but let's face it, sex sells. While it may be a tad shameless to make a downright porn film, Kevin Smith has injected some of the usual quirks found in his filmography, as well as paying homage to his fan boy roots. You can tell this by the numerous moments where pop culture comes into reference, as well as quite a significant time spent on bastardization of Star Wars (entitled Star Whores) that the characters dwell upon, to great comic effect. If you are a fan of George Lucas' galactic series, you may take offense, but might still credit Smith for his wild imagination. If you're not a fan, you'll whoop for joy as you'll probably agree with how it got ripped to shreds. Either way, one wonders of course if this is indeed Smith's secret fantasy (with Princess Lay-Her *ahem*), but I digress.While it took a while for Zack (Set Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) to conceive the titular plan to save their sorry state of cash flow problems, this movie is not about making a porn film for the sake of. It may have touched upon some moments of truth that one might venture into this somewhat considered lucrative business, but ultimately at its core, it's still a straightforward romance that reared its clichéd head (pardon the pun) in building up to the finale, and one that talks about friendship in general. It follows a typical zero to hero storyline for all the characters involved, and through making this film, they discover new found friendships that can withstand some hard knocks (well, considering you have to bear your privates for everyone else to see) together with finding some great camaraderie amongst them misfits, and taking centerstage is the underlying, unsaid romance between two house mates who deny their affections for each other for the longest time.Seth Rogens may be famous for playing roles such as these, with his lucky stint opposite Katherine Heigel in Knocked Up, as well as various Judd Apatow films, so some might consider that he could play Zack with his eyes closed. Truth is, he does, and I guess it will take some time before he could get out of this stereotype. Hopefully, his Green Hornet project would take off properly, and for detractors, I guess you'll need to watch this film to see him sans his beard to be convinced that he just might pull it off. Elizabeth Banks had a lot more to do here of course in fleshing our Miri, since she is primarily the yes-no-flip-flop character who refuses to listen to her heart, and her dalliance with such indecisiveness, puts a strain in the friendship with Zack.There are plenty of scenes here that earned merit, but I particularly liked the out of place one in the first third of the story, where a school reunion is to get us chummy and comfortable with both Zack and Miri's characters, but contains enough laughs here to leave you in stitches. Look out for Justin Long playing Brandon, and Brandon Routh (the latest Superman) being Long, in what would probably be amongst the best jokes in the film, with Routh being the punching bag for Long's really flamboyant character with a deep voice.Like I said, it's funny and it's no holds barred, so go in with an open mind and an attitude to just laugh at everyone's funny antics (right down to poop jokes if you will), and you just may leave with a nice smile at the end of it. Oh yeah, remember to stay tuned when the end credits roll for a look into the aftermath of Zack and Miri's film production company!",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
18,namashi_1,A bad letdown!,5,4 March 2009,"'Zack & Miri Make A Porno' is a bad film, a letdown in all respects. Its a great idea gone wrong. It disappoints and How! I want to ask the director on why did he waste such a great and exciting topic! Not fair!Performances: Seth Rogen excels all the way. He's a very natural actor, this film proves it once again. Banks looks amazingly and does fabulous job. Her granny panties leave you amused. Justin Long is outstanding as the Gay porn actor. Ruth also does well. The actor who plays the producer and the actor who plays the restaurant owner are also fantastic. 'Zack & Miri Make A Porno' is average flick at best. As said before a golden opportunity gone wrong.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
19,StevePulaski,"As a Movie, It Was Funny. As Kevin Smith, It Was Passable.",6,20 August 2010,"Zack and Miri Make a Porno could have easily been turned into a Judd Apatow film. Making the sex scenes a bit less raunchy, extend it, tweak the characters and add a bit more description and throw in a moral and it would have done perfect. As far as this being a Kevin Smith movie, it is not. It is not a Kevin Smith film. It doesn't have the great, natural, unscripted dialog Clerks, Dogma, and Chasing Amy all have. It lacks the feel, nice moral, and overall positive sometimes problematic feel of one of his movies. Its a straight laced Comedy with little to no dialog scenes. Thats all.I want to get straight to the plot because I have a lot to say about this. Underachieving, life long friends and current roommates Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are desperate for money after the water and the lights are turned off in their apartment. Zack comes up with the idea to round up friends to direct and star in a pornographic film and they go and give it a shot (no dirty pun intended). They round up all their friends and after the idea of their movie Star Whores goes down, they make a new one very cheap and just go with the flow.In Kevin Smith standards, its a one and a half star movie. In movie standards, its a decent Comedy. I respect Kevin Smith wanting to do a different movie taking a break from the characters in the View Askew world. Its just like when he took a break in 2004 and did Jersey Girl and then one in 2010 to do Cop Out and his upcoming film Red State/ So its clear to us that Smith wants a break from the typical characters and wants to take on a style of it's own. Which is alright, but if KS really wanted to do this I wish he didn't get us so attached to the characters then throw a curveball out of nowhere.I believe that anybody can do whatever they want. Its fine by me. Im have no control or say in what an actor or director wants to pursue. But I do have an opinion. Kevin Smith works best with movies that connect which is what the View Askew system does. All the movies connect in a unique way and to see these not connected sequels out of nowhere just slow things down. Kevin Smith even said he wants a Jay and Silent Bob cartoon, he wants to do a Dogma prequel comic saying why Bartleby and Loki were sent to Wisconsin, a Clerks III, and a Clerks: Sell Out comic. So with all the things planned for the View Askew timeline Im surprised KS has time to do unrelated movies.This is in no way bad, it's just a typical Comedy which I know is not Kevin Smith's best. My opinion is that KS cant do a normal Comedy, he needs to do things with his Kevin Smith spice. His dialog and characters need to be elaborated to the fullest detail. He needs to have them in the most detailed point blank description. This movie just throws a bunch of characters in the picture, not elaborated, and if this had great dialog scenes it could have very well been called ""a perfect Kevin Smith film"".The cameos do impress though. I love Justin Long's character and I love his voice in this movie. I found him to be one of the funniest parts in this whole movie. Same goes with Jeff Anderson. I found him to hysterical in this movie but must question why on the cover he is wearing a pizza man costume when he's never seen in a costume in the actual movie? Small flaw, no big, but he does do a great job in this as far as cameos go. Traci Lords also does a very funny job in this too.Overall, Zack and Miri Make a Porno is an interesting Comedy with some classic feel, but its not Kevin Smith's cup of tea. In the future I hope he can stick to the View Askew library of characters rather than inventing his own. Still my favorite director, but not my favorite thing in his filmography.Starring: Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Craig Robinson, Jason Mewes, Traci Lords, Jeff Anderson, Katie Morgan, Justin Long, and Ricky Mabe.

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Porno's were not meant for a story... or are they?,7,12 November 2008,"Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Kevin Smith who wrote and directed this, he's made some hit and miss comedies over the years, he's a great writer, he's made some extremely memorable films and characters. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is one of his good, but forgettable films though. Don't get me wrong, this is a very funny movie, it has some great moments, mostly at the beginning though, where as Justin Long just steals the show and you definitely want more of his character in the story. But there are some jokes that just completely gross me out, now I love Kevin Smith, but it seems as if he is now trying to compete with the Apatow clan, because it had that feel to it, only with more gross jokes. I'm sorry, but someone getting feces on them... it's just disgusting and really threw me off for the rest of the film. But Kevin still wrote a decent script that is good for a few laughs.Zack and Miri have been best friends since grade school, they're roommates now and are struggling like crazy to pay their bills. After attending their high school reunion, they meet the former quarterback stud and his boyfriend to find out they make and distribute their own porno's and make very good money at it. So Zack and Miri come on board as well, they're going to make a cheap porno with a group of friends and amateur porn stars. After constant games of who has feelings for who, Zack and Miri realize there might be more there than just a friendship as well.Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a good comedy, I loved the scene where they are shooting their first take, right in the middle of the sex that is taking place in a coffee shop, a drunk as heck customer walks in and just makes it more awkward than it already is. There are some other great scenes in here, while the film has it's really gross jokes and the story is nothing original when it comes to the friends becoming lovers, it was still a fun movie to watch. I just feel like this isn's Kevin Smith's strongest film, but it's worth the ticket price if you're looking for a few laughs, just take the title into consideration if you're thinking about seeing this.7/10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

22,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Doesn't work in the way a good film generally should, but still appropriately funny in parts as it was meant to be",7,5 December 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Zack (Seth Rogan) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are mismatched looking plutonic friends who have known each other since high school who have fallen on hard times financially. When their heat, water and electricity are cut off after they are left unpaid for months, they realize they must think of a get rich quick scheme fast or lose the means to survive. The solution seems to come at a high school reunion when an encounter with two outed gay former year-mates gets them to hit on an idea: make a porno. They can think of titles and character names for England, but are exposed for the hopeless amateurs they are when they and their friends actually try to make one.This subversively titled comedy film takes what is still a taboo subject matter and has made it into a mainstream film, with a tell-it-like-it-is title that lays it all on the line and you may have trouble saying with a straight face to some. But most of the laughs in Zack and Miri Make a Porno are at the beheist of sheer silliness, very adult humour rendered to a very infantile level, from the various silly porn titles (here mainly focused on a Star Wars themed porno with names such as Hung Solo and Princess Lay-her) as well as more gross out stuff in the shape of excrement landing on people. It's all quite daring for a mainstream feature, to be honest, certainly a potentially very offensive slant on what is normal and expected. The plot's a bit too piece-meal and apathetic to hold your attention all the way, Rogan is a little too loud, foul mouthed and obnoxious to be likable and there's a gushy romantic ending that feels at odds with all the dirty, lowbrow humour that's been going on through-out, like a love song at the end of a Chubby Brown DVD. But it's daring, subversive humour through-out and if you get in the mood for it, you will laugh quite a lot at the dirty absurdity of it all. ***",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

They go to a high school reunion and meet an old classmate that is now a gay adult porn star. This gives them the idea to make a porno in order to make some quick cash. So, they find some people to be in the film. The funniest character was Delaney, the fellow coffee shop employee and financial backer. He had some good lines.There wasn't much nudity as one would expect. I thought it was tame. So Zack and Miri get it on for the film and realize they are in love.

24,Bored_Dragon,Kevin Smith nailed it again.,9,23 December 2017,"I don't know how objective I'm capable to be when it comes to Kevin Smith movies, but to me this was awesome. Essentially, this is classic romance comedy, but wrapped in completely unusual package. Politically incorrect, vulgar, perverse, and most of all fun. I'm sorry I didn't see it back when it was released, cause I would know it by heart by now. Roommates and best friends since childhood, Zack and Miri, have seemingly hopeless financial troubles, so they decide to get back on their feet by making a porno. If I still didn't persuade you to see this flick, I will just say that lead roles in their porno, beside of course themselves, play Jason Mewes, Katie Morgan and Traci Lords.

25,kenjha,Amateur Hour,3,4 July 2010,"Struggling roommates come up with an idea to make a quick buck in this lame comedy. The script is amateurish and humorless. What's more, there isn't a single two-dimensional character here. Everybody is a caricature and the relationship between Rogan and Banks is never believable. In fact, all the characters are so crude and rude that they don't resemble really people. The film is based on the sophomoric premise that the f-word is funny, and that cramming multiple f-words into every line will make the film hilarious. Not only does the comedy not work at all, but the later attempt to turn the film into a touching romance falls completely flat.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
26,The-Sarkologist,Romance - Kevin Smith Style,6,23 March 2019,"It has taken me a while to get around to watching this film, probably because it actually isn't one of the easiest films to find. Mind you, it did receive a lot of harsh criticism, but despite the name that this film bears, you don't actually see all that much, or at least nothing more than what you would see in your typical MA rated movie (using the Australian rating systems).Well, maybe, because we need to remember that this is a Kevin Smith film, so while what we see on screen may not necessarily be all that bad, the language is absolutely atrocious. Look, I can get away with saying that because I have seen most of his films, or at least his foundational films, and do quite appreciate him as an artist. Having said that, this certainly isn't one of his best films.Basically the film is about these two down and outers - Zack and Miri. They live together so that they can afford to pay the bills, and have known each other since kindergarten. However, as far as life goes, they really haven't amounted to much - they basically work in a coffee shop. The funny thing is that it seems to run like those films where they go to their school renunion as realise that, unlike their school mates, they haven't amounted to all that much - except they don't care, they don't care at all. They don't go into the porn business because they want to impress their school mates, and are upset that they are no hopers, they do it because they need to pay their bills, and after talking to the partner of one of their friends, realised that there is money in porn (or at least there was back when this film was made - I doubt there is anymore).Actually, this is basically a romance, or at least it is a romance in the way that Kevin Smith makes a romance - pretty gritty actually. Still, what happens when a couple who are friends decide to make a porno, and then begin to realise that maybe they are more than friends, and start having issues about simply sleeping with any old person - in a way it seemed to be easy at first, but as the movie progresses they start to realise that maybe, just maybe, there really isn't such a thing as empty sex. Anyway, as most romances end up, this pretty much does so as well.Which is why I didn't think that it was one of Smith's better films. It really didn't have that depth that films like Chasing Amy had, nor did it have the wit that films like Clerks had. Really, it was basically a lot of swearing that really wasn't all that funny. Sure, there happened to be a couple of the really way out things that seem to only come from the mind of Kevin Smith, or at least normal people like me only learn about them from people like Kevin Smith (such as the Dutch Rubber), but honestly, this film really doesn't sit up there all that much. In a way, I guess that is probably why we haven't see, or heard, all that much from Kevin Smith beyond his more mundane media appearances.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
27,sol-,Seth and Liz Make a Comedy,7,24 September 2016,"Desperate to raise enough money to pay their mounting bills and rent, two platonic flatmates decide to film and star in a homemade pornographic movie, but things get complicated when they realise that they might really love each other in this lively Kevin Smith comedy. As usual, Smith litters the film with entertaining supporting characters, with Jason Mewes particularly interesting, repressing his Jay mannerisms to play an uninhibited amateur porn actor, and Justin Long as a gay professional in the business has rarely been funnier. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks also make for likable leads, however, the overall film comes off as a notch below Smith's par. Predictability is a key issue here as it is telegraphed from very early on that the protagonists will realise that they love each other and get jealous on set. More detrimental though is the way Smith allows sentimentality to overtake his penchant for quirky humour. Sentiment is not uncommon in Smith films; 'Mallrats' and 'Chasing Amy' (arguably his best movies) have sentiment in spades, but in both cases, it is squeezed in and around the kooky supporting characters and raunchy jokes. Here, the plot seems to halt whenever Rogen and Banks reassess their feelings for one another. Never to mind, 'Zack and Miri Make a Porno' has far more highs than lows. The makeshift movie studios, non-professional costumes and boom mike incidents are funny, the 'Star Wars' referencing is a lot of fun and the zany extras in the middle of the end credits ensure the film ends on a strong note.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
28,tomgillespie2002,Funny if formulaic rom-com from Kevin Smith,6,6 February 2016,"Despite the obvious smuttiness of the title, Zack and Miri Make a Porno is one of writer/director Kevin Smith's sweetest, and most formulaic, films to date. Pushing it's 'R' rating to the limit with its combination of sexual innuendo, crude profanity and skin-on-skin action, Seth Rogen's cuddly and beardy Zack and Elizabeth Banks's bubbly and adorably inept Miri - life-long friends sharing a frozen Pittsburg apartment - are a particularly cutesy couple, and the slow realisation of their love for one another provides a nice and oddly believable romance.Having not paid their utility bills in months due to sheer bone idleness and Zack's weakness for making ridiculous online purchases, Zack and Miri are cut off and are left to huddle next to a home-made indoor fire in their overcoats. Whilst attending their high school reunion, Miri hopes to bump uglies with her former crush, Bobby Long (Brandon Routh), but discovers that he is now gay and in a relationship with gay porn star Brandon (Justin Long - a porn name if I ever heard one). Impressed with Brandon's success, Zack suggests to Miri that they make their own porn movie in the hope of making enough money to have the lights switched back on.At its best, Zack and Miri is very funny, with Craig Robinson's deadpan Delaney, Zack's co-worker who helps fund the project, providing the majority of the films most humorous moments. When it really should be the anti-When Harry Met Sally (1989), it misses a trick by following the rom-com gospel to a tee. Although it certainly doesn't shy away from the porn (Jason Mewes and Traci Lords get to enjoy most of that), its little more than a veil for a traditional ""it was you all along!"" romance. Still, even though it doesn't reach the heights of Smith's best works like Clerks (1994) and Chasing Amy (1997), there are plenty of laughs to be had for the casual audience and Smith cultists alike.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
29,zkonedog,Absolutely No Direction Or Feeling Present,1,28 February 2017,"Though comedies are usually not my cup of tea when it comes to film, I've usually always been impressed by the work of Seth Rogen and the persona he has been able to cultivate on-screen. Unfortunately, ""Zack and Miri Make A Porno"" proves that a great director can be a comedian's best friend...or worst enemy.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Zack (Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks), two people living together trying to make ends meet. When it begins to become clear that the ends will never meet, Zack hatches a plan to make some quick dough...a home-made porno film.This movie is primarily an example of how you can't just ""let a comedian loose"" on film. Under the direction of, say, Judd Apatow in ""Knocked Up"", Rogen was brilliant because the stories going on around him were also interesting. The same can be said (though to a lesser extent) for the more recent ""Neighbors"". In ""Zack & Miri"", however, there is nothing interesting that happens in this movie AT ALL. Rogen is expected to carry the entire film and he can't manage such a feat alone.This is truly a terrible movie that was an utter waste of time from beginning to end. On top of the candidate list for one of the worst flicks I've seen in a number of years. Watch some of the aforementioned Rogen efforts instead if you are craving some juvenile humor.

The movie is really predictable though. I mean it was pretty obvious that by the end of the film Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) were going to end up loving each other and being a couple. This movie is filed with a lot of raunchy jokes. Its rated R for a reason and the title proves that. Though the title is really weird and it should have been called something else.

31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A dirty, foul-mouthed...romcom",7,2 November 2008,"""Zack and Miri Make A Porno"" might be the raunchiest comedy, well, ever, so how could it possibly be cliché? Somehow, Kevin Smith has found a way to push our censorship boundaries while simultaneously offering an off-brand but all too familiar romantic comedy as ""sex changes everything"" for Zack and Miri.That's right horny dudes that can't wait to get to the theaters to see Zack and Miri--bring your emotional side because you'll need it. Not to say romance dominates this film in any way, because in general this a film that is just flat out dirty and funny, but it certainly leaves a funny taste in your mouth because truthfully it doesn't work when it is used.Kevin Smith has made his career on his open-minded, thoughtful and delightfully dirty scripts and he certainly sets this film up along those lines. But then things take a turn for ""Jersey Girl"" at a few points and you really can't believe it. The best way to describe the schizophrenic behavior of parts of the film is to explain the juxtaposition of two scenes in the film that couldn't be more unalike and occur within seconds of each other. *SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD* In one scene, let's just say they're filming a rather dirty part of the porno and something completely appalling happens that will make you laugh hysterically and then Smith cuts right away to Miri finding Zack has abandoned their apartment. It really makes you uncomfortable transitioning from dirty high point to emotional."" About the only thing it does is show how Elizabeth Banks can do both really well. She has a future beyond these movies, that's for sure.Other than the plot when the romance gets mixed in, there's nothing but good things to say about ""Zack and Miri."" Seth Rogen is in top form and he's a bit more down to earth in this film compared to his Apatow work which is nice. Craig Robinson (Darryl from ""The Office"") rounds out a nice ensemble cast that includes Justin Long, Smith regular Jason Mewes and a few names from the adult film industry. If you can handle the dirty, dialog-heavy humor, you'll agree that ""Zack and Miri"" is definitely a good overall comedy that is open to talking about pretty much anything.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
32,Anonymous_Maxine,Sex still more offensive than violence,7,6 March 2009,"If Kevin Smith can't do anything new with the romantic comedy genre I think it's pretty safe to assume that it's never going to happen. The first 45 minutes or so of Zack and Miri Make A Porno have some of the funniest stuff I've seen in a movie since Pineapple Express (which was written by fellow funnyman Judd Apatow). The scene where Zack is talking to the two gay guys at the high school reunion cost me a perfectly good cup of delicious iced coffee, most of which ended up in my lap and sprayed all over my coffee table. I think I rewound that scene and watched it over again about 15 times before I finally heard everything over my laughing. But there definitely comes a point in the movie where the predictability factor shoots through the roof and, despite Kevin Smith's undeniably outstanding writing skills, the movie takes a serious downturn. I am not as huge of a fan of Kevin Smith as some of my friends. One of my best friends grew up in New Jersey right next to where Clerks was filmed and has thus developed kind of a special relationship with Smith's films, but while I enjoyed Clerks and loved Mallrats and was mildly impressed with Chasing Amy (except for all the screaming), I haven't been very interested in anything Smith has done since then. I was outwardly bored with Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back seemed like such a cash-in to me, I still haven't gotten around to seeing Clerks II and I'll probably never watch Jersey Girl. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are in that thing, for God's sake.But for a good portion of Zack and Miri I thought that I had been missing something all along, or at least that I had forgotten the undeniable charm of Smith's work. It's true that he is a brilliant writer. He can create conversations that have a hugely profane but still realistic flow, and with actors like Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks (and a whole list of others) nailing all of their lines, it makes for something special in the comedy department. Sadly, the movie is so predictable that I almost feel like I should give you a spoiler warning just to tell you that.Zack and Miri are life-long friends who have a relationship of convenience. They enjoy each other's company and have a real friendship, but they are roommates primarily for financial reasons. They both have dead-end jobs and rely on each other to share the rent and bills, but a variety of factors (mostly Zack's inability to put their utility bills above a ""Fleshlight"" on his list of priorities) they eventually find themselves months behind on their bills and unable to pay their rent. One day Miri accidentally allows herself to be filmed by a couple of teenagers while she's changing clothes in plain sight at the coffee shop where Zack works and the video shows up on the internet with hundreds of thousands of people watching it daily. Not a bad turnout for what is really a pretty thoroughly uninteresting video, but no matter. This gives Zack the idea that they should make a porno. Even if only the 800 or so people from their high school graduating class bought a copy for $20 a pop or so, it would instantly solve all of their financial problems.It's interesting to notice that Zack and Miri suffer through more moral and emotional torment trying to accept the idea of having sex with each other than they do about selling their naked images to strangers. I would have thought that crossing the line into making porn movies would be a pretty big step, but not these two. You see, it seems that Miri's parents are dead and Zack grandparents are dead (?), so they have no one to be disappointed in them. It is, however, one of the film's clever accusations of the public at large that the only reason that everyone doesn't get involved in making porn is because they're worried about what their parents would think.They amass a makeshift crew made up of Lester the Molester (Jason Mewes), a stripper named Stacey (real life porn star Katie Morgan), an aging stripper named Bubbles (Traci Lords) who earns her name with a rather disturbing trick that she does at bachelor parties, and Barry, a black man with a brutal marriage to a black caricature of a wife and more than his share of financial problems himself. The first half of the movie is some of the best work that Smith has done in years. The dialogue is hilarious, none of the film's admittedly extensive profanity seems overdone, and even the characters are believable as they make this completely unbelievable plan. I spent most of the first half of the movie trying to figure out what was going to go wrong and prevent the porno from ever being filmed, but I spent the second half watching the movie slog through a sadly lengthy list of romantic comedy clichés as it labored toward the obligatory Hollywood ending.I understand that the word ""porno"" has generated some controversy, prompting some newspapers to refuse to print ads for the movie and some theaters to refuse to show it. I'm wondering if Kevin Smith predicted this and if it was part of his decision to use this title, since getting his film banned from select theaters and newspapers is probably the quickest and most efficient way to ensure it's success. At any rate, it is another sad, sad sign of the times when the word ""porno"" will generate frantic animosity, but no one has a problem with blood-soaked, degenerate films like Hostel and the never-ending Saw films from being shipped to theaters. Go figure.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
33,jzappa,"Kevin Smith Graduates, and Frees Himself, with this Impressive Interfamilial Buddy Romantic Comedy.",8,6 May 2009,"The way Kevin Smith's contemporaries have graduated up through the hierarchy of American production values, Tarantino with his epic nostalgic samurai and gangster epics, Spike Lee with his heavyweight ethnic dramas, Paul Thomas Anderson with his Oscar-nominated serendipitous generational dramas, and Richard Linklater with his wide array of experimental pieces, Smith has likewise reached the top of the food chain in the more particular department of crude twentysomething sex comedies. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is finally Smith's signal that he is moving forward with his body of work rather than contributing nod after nod after nod to the glory days of his significant additions to the 1990s. That is not to say, nevertheless, that he is not contributing yet another variation on the tune of a nod. From the very beginning, we're processing very familiar themes and references that are indeed his signature: there are many hockey sticks, myriad obligatory Star Wars references, fingers up asses, post-high school life, finding out someone is gay when you have a crush on them. Notwithstanding, they're all clocked in even before we're halfway through, as another trademark of Smith's approach is movement of his stories through extensive early dialogue, which remains his way of successfully pulling you in and making you feel leisurely and at ease with what he's giving you.In spite of it all, as well as Smith's widely recognized humility as a director, he is growing as one. Rather than writing his dialogue in stone as evinced in his initial New Jersey Saga, his most pivotal four earliest films, his characters here are allowed to loosen up, thus his actors as well. Perhaps this owes to his conscious player-trading with Judd Apatow's barnyard of grateful collaborators and old friends. I, too, am grateful, because it pays off a great deal here. The interaction of old high school buddies attached to the hip Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks with Banks' old crush Brandon Routh and not-before-acquainted porn producer Justin Long, in a truly odd but fortunate and hilariously ironic twist of casting, is some of the best work Smith has ever done, for the most part proving his expertise and well-deserved royal status in the social circle of the genre. In particular, Rogen, even when not the focal point at a certain time, is always funny when he reacts facially and when he comments, as he does when Long and Routh turn out to be a gay couple both working in the gay porn industry when they argue fiercely in front of him, and he says, ""They fight just like real people.""Smith now clearly recognizes the beautiful dichotomy of directing one's own script, allowing creative flexibility on the part of his truly talented cast all around and discerningly rebounding with what he knows is the strength of the words he's written. The porn title suggestions are Class A, for example. I won't give any of them away so as not to diminish their integrity once seeing the film, although I'm sure you know Star Whores. The cast, in return, builds on the impact of their lines and exchanges. Another specific example is Craig Robinson, who might've made me laugh the most. And Gerry Bednob, who's also a very similar character in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, is always memorable. They share a memorable amount of screen time together. I was certainly surprised about the comparatively unassociated casting of George A. Romero's make-up artist Tom Savini.Smith's rather fresh new premise likewise builds on the lessons of his work instead of the same characters, as per Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back or Clerks II. I am fond of his varyingly successful ventures outside of the official View Askewniverse, as they have begun to definitely seem the most personal. As 2003's Jersey Girl, whose commercial success was no doubt dampened in large part by the ridiculous Benifer stigmas, offered his insights into parenthood not long after he'd begun to have children with wife journalist-turned-actress Jennifer Schwalbach, Zack and Miri Make a Porno affords the tough lessons of no-budget movie-making. The lifelong platonic friends and roommates of the title look to solve their cash-flow problems by making an adult film together, and between the lines of the premise, as the cameras roll and the duo begin to sense that they may have more feelings for each other than they previously thought, there are whole scenes constructed from definite echoes of Kevin Smith's own journey through making a successful debut with Clerks.Another credit based on my long-awaited revisiting of Silent Bob is that, unlike many directors of generations much earlier than his, he remains unwilling to take the easy way to the conclusion of a script. Thus, instead of a gift-wrapped Happy Madison comedy, the movie is seized and squeezed of all its benefit, which is very much an intriguing and touching insight into the emotional strings of sex and its erratic though fundamentally dependent relation with porn.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
34,Chris Knipp,Harvey and Kevin make a love story,7,29 October 2008,"Roommates and longtime friends Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) meet a gay couple (Brandon Routh and Justin Long) at a high school reunion held on the eve of Thanksgiving. One of these guys (Routh) is so handsome and charming Miri crudely and of course futilely propositions him on the spot. Zack happens to talk to his lover (Long, hilariously deep-voiced and confident). It turns out the gay men produce and act in their own profitable line of gay porn films. They really are good-looking and have it together, and Zack and Miri, being so broke their electricity and water have been cut off, decide to make a porno of their own. The plot twist, obvious in conventional romantic comedy terms, is that the process of shooting a sex scene with them in it makes Zack and Miri, who, we don't know exactly why, have contented themselves with hasty, meaningless sex with others up to now, realize--after a slight delay--that they've really loved each other along.Smith's use of Seth Rogen in a schlub-wins-pretty-girl comedy (there's no doubt that Elizabeth Banks is pretty) links him with Judd Apatow's productions, but let's hope he isn't swallowed up by the Apatow factory. Apatow can do anything, but in spite of the success of 'Knocked Up,' 'Super Bad,' 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and 'Pineapple Express,' I wish he'd go back to producing really good failed TV series like 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Undeclared,' where Seth got started and Judd gave birth to all the good comedy.Kevin Smith's continuing appeal is his own. It lies in his faithfulness to his New Jersey ""Askewniverse"" regional working-class outlook and in his ability to call a spade a spade, ""spade,"" in this case, being a string of four-letter words. He has never strayed far from his basic concerns even when more money came his way, as it did as soon as his under-$30,000 debut production 'Clerks' was snapped up by Miramax and feted at Sundance and Cannes. Smith's movies are frank and contemporary, outrageous and funny. Above all they're sui generis, a quality achieved through adhering closely to favorite tropes and locales and a posse of pals.His dead-end mallrats entering their thirties without accomplishment or future speak truth, and the best things about his movies has always been the dialogue, which is spiky and arresting and nonstop and alive, even if he avoids polish so studiously that the lines aren't as memorable as they might be. Or is it just that I'm too old to be fully tuned in to the language, even though I understand it? Relationships and situations get honest treatment, even though they're hardly explored in depth. He's also good at politics and religion, as in 'Dogma', which took things a step beyond 'Clerks.' Raised as an Irish Catholic, Smith delighted in insulting the Church, but the Catholic League didn't take his provocations lightly. Sometimes drawing on Ben Afleck and Matt Damon and other celebs, he's kept going back to the same crew of actor-friends and characters, including Jason Lee, Brian O'Halloran, Mr. Affleck, Betty Aberlin, Jeff Anderson, Walter Flanagan, Ernest O'Donnell, or course Kevin Smith himself (""Silent Bob""), and my own favorite and the most frequent of all, the provocative yet needy Jason Mewes. Smith's last movie was 'Clerks II,' which much like Zack, highlighted a sexually outrageous act in a shoddy fast food joint. A good addition here is Zack's black cohort from his place of work, Delaney (Craig Robinson of the US TV ""The Office""), who has great timing and delivery, and becomes the porno's producer.In a way Zack even directly reenacts what Smith actually did when he shot 'Clerks'--he made a movie at night in the New Jersey convenience store where he was then working in the daytime. The crew in Zack wind up making their porno at night in the non-Starbucks coffee shop called Bean-N-Gone where Zack and Delaney work. Predictably, a guy (Tyler Labine) comes in in the wee hours to buy a cup of coffee so he can drive home. He's so drunk he doesn't notice that one of the new porn recruits and Jason Mewes are having sex on a platform in front of the counter. This time, even though it's put off and partly an afterthought, the main characters not only find love but success in free enterprise--with their friends.Smith's dialogue never falters. But I confess to an increasing nostalgia for the purity and simplicity of the original Clerks. That had a promise, a sense of how ordinary guys could be witty and smart, a sense that though nothing was happening, something momentous still might. It hasn't. 'Zack and Miri' doesn't take us any further than 'Clerks II' did; I think 'Clerks II' even had cleverer dialogue. This time down-and-dirty language is beginning to feel wearisome. It's beginning to feel forced. People don't talk that way all the time--at least women don't. But that doesn't mean Smith's fans are burned out. The Weinstein brothers have picked up this one, and nobody's going to lose any money. Last time I compared Kevin Smith to Eric Rohmer. That may seem far fetched at first, due to Rohmer's delicacy vs. Smith's gross-out factor. But both filmmakers are essentially perpetual adolescents who write good dialogue. Both of them go back to the same themes every time. Rohmer doesn't make a masterpiece every time and neither does Smith. But you keep coming back. I still like this vulgarian indie auteur.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
35,dfranzen70,"Clever, delicious raunch",7,3 November 2008,"Like most of Kevin Smith's films, Zack and Miri is clever and dirty. In fact, if it weren't so clever, you'd think it was just another sex-obsessed cheapo teen flick, and if it weren't so dirty, you'd think it was just another cerebral comedy laced with knowing pop-culture references and a hint of snark. So like I said, it's like most of Kevin Smith's films, only more so. And not set in New Jersey and not featuring Jay and Silent Bob. But other than that, totally the same deal.Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are completely platonic roommates in a Pittsburgh suburb who've fallen on hard times. (It's tough to find money for the rent when you gotta have the new Fleshlight.) The power and the water get shut off, and it's Thanksgiving. And then, after a traumatic tenth high school reunion, it hits them: they'll have to make an adult film to make ends meet.So the two irresistible comic forces of Kevin Smith and Judd Apatow, in the form of Rogen, don't so much collide as meet genially, shake hands, and genuflect. It's a great match, the acerbic, nerdy outlook of Smith and the populist ravings of Rogen; he's sort of like Brian O'Halloran of Clerks, only worlds more charismatic and likable, and he's got the comic timing of a Dick Van Dyke in his prime. Or, if you will, Robin Williams, complete with back hair.As with the best Smith movies, there are several knee-slapping scenes that you won't want to watch with your parents. Just a warning. Hey, this movie almost got the dreaded NC-17 slapped on it, and it has ""porno"" right there in the dadblamed title, so you know it's not a cute-bunny-rabbit movie. Oh, and so you're even more forearmed, there's actual sex in the movie. Real people getting naked. Even some scenes of a taboo nature.The basic gist is that Zack and Miri audition actors, write a script, find someone who can shoot, and find a location with the expected hijinks and missteps along the way. But even the expected stuff is wickedly funny, like when the entire movie nearly has to be scuttled because the storage locker in which they'd been filming had just been demolished. Or the reunion itself, where Miri learns that the hot guy who teased her throughout high school isn't quite what she'd imagined he'd turn out to be.But at the center of the movie, past the raunch-encrusted outer layer, is a true heart. Can Zack and Miri make this porno, including their own sex scene, without exacerbating their own relationship? To dumb it down for some who might be within the core audience of this fine film, I'll be even blunter: Can they shtup without it meaning a wack-a-doodle thing? I mean, they both say it won't change anything, but we all know better, because we are not them.Smith's characters are, as usual, honest and authentic to a fault; Zack is an overbearing jackass at times, just like Seth Rogen was in Knocked Up, and Miri is self-absorbed and sort of dim. But both are extremely charming and hilarious, and this is due in part to the strong, robust script by Smith. This is the first Smith film, by the way, that's not set in or shot in New Jersey, and it's only the second not to feature Jay and Silent Bob, although it does have Jason Mewes as one of the porn stars and Jeff Anderson as the cameraman. (Anderson, it should be noted, is fantastic, doing a lot with the comparatively few lines he has.) I laughed a lot. I didn't cry at all, and I wasn't bored, so good times all around. Hey, I like Kevin Smith, and judging from the wild series of tubes that is the Internet, a lot of other people do as well. I think this movie's on par with most of his stuff, although it could never grab the raw virility of the low-low-low-budget Clerks, and it's really just a lot of fun to watch.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
36,dee.reid,"Why did I wait so long to see this movie? This is the best ""Porno"" I've ever seen!",10,12 January 2010,"Kevin Smith's latest, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno,"" as some have already said, is one of the most deceptively innocent (and I really mean ""guilty"") and romantic comedy films to ever come out this decade. Smith has really matured as a filmmaker over the years, since his infamous debut ""Clerks."" (1994). He matured greatly with ""Chasing Amy"" (1997), and in my opinion really hit pay-dirt with ""Clerks II"" in 2006, which is my favorite film of his so far.And yet, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" feels very different from the usual Kevin Smith movie. I guess what makes it different is the fact that the film is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (instead of Smith's home turf of New Jersey), there is a cast of largely new actors to the View Askew-verse, a few Smith regulars, and no Jay & Silent Bob.Still, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is very much in line with the innate sweetness of ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Clarks II,"" in that all three of these films mix Smith's trademark vulgarity and laugh-a-minute witty dialogue with a real sense of heart & soul, a real sense of heart & soul that may escape some viewers. ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno,"" despite its risqué title and plot, is a sweetly romantic and incredibly funny romantic comedy that in spite of its excesses, really gets to you in the end and make you feel all warm inside.Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are two best friends since childhood and roommates who managed to keep their relationship totally platonic over the years that they've known each other. Cash-strapped and about to be evicted from their crappy little apartment, they decide that the only reasonable thing they can do to try to get out of debt is to make a porno film. Rallying up a motley crew of bizarre but dedicated locals who include Zack's co-worker Delaney (Craig Robinson), Deacon (Jeff Anderson), Lester (""Jay"" Jason Mewes), exotic dancer Bubbles (real-life ex-porn star Traci Lords) and stripper Stacey (real-life porn star Katie Morgan), they set about to do the unthinkable: make a porno. And somewhere in there, as they bare themselves for the camera (and to a greater/lesser extend, depending on how you look at it, each other), the always-platonic relationship between Zack and Miri takes a startling turn for the positive as their always-platonic friendship develops into something more, I don't know, romantic (?).I seriously think that Kevin Smith has really outdone himself with this picture. The movie perfectly mixes sweetness with raunchiness it's almost unbelievable that he was able to get away with so much in this picture (I've even read that it was originally given an ""NC-17"" rating for its graphic content, but Smith and company appealed to get an ""R"" rating). But even then, this is clearly a comedy that is not for kids. For those of us that can handle a little explicit nudity, raunchy dialogue and crazy/bizarre sex acts (she isn't called Bubbles for nothing, you know), you will definitely find a moving and funny romantic experience.Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks make a believable screen pair; these two first met on the set of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005) and their careers took off after that, and now they're back together here. Although you can probably guess where it's all going to go in the end, it's a fun ride until we get there. I think that what makes them work so well as characters is because there are some people out there who have been in the same position as these two, and can relate to their dilemma. The surrounding performers provide an interesting foundation for Rogen and Banks's characters to grow, especially Jason Mewes playing a hyper-sexualized variation of his trademark character Jay, Jeff Anderson getting ""in"" on a great joke at his expense, and porn actress Katie Morgan getting to shine as well in a role that does prove that even porn stars can act, sometimes.""Zack and Miri Make a Porno,"" despite its raunchy excesses, is one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while. It's certainly better than the usual Hollywood stuff that comes out on a weekly basis. It shines because Kevin Smith was behind its production, and he proved that even heart & soul can be found in raunchy excess.10/10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
37,drqshadow-reviews,Director Kevin Smith Presses On With a Familiar Formula,6,9 August 2011,"This was pretty much what I expected it to be, no more and no less. Kevin Smith has been deeply entrenched in what I like to call his ""mullet years"" for some time now, making movies that want to be hip and sharp-witted for his hardcore fans, but also warm-hearted and dumbed down for the larger audiences he's always missed out on. Its not a recipe for success, or at least for thoughtful movie-making. Most directors only stumble across something like ""Chasing Amy"" once in their careers, and as much as it disappoints me to realize it, Smith just isn't good enough at what he does to make that happen again. He's bound and determined to try, though, and lukewarm feature-lengths like this one are the end result. It's better than ""Clerks 2"", at least, and was on a good roll in the first act before it veered off into the wilderness aboard the dramallama.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
38,MaxBorg89,Kevin Smith makes us laugh... again,8,25 December 2008,"Every once in a while, Kevin Smith needs a well-deserved break from his famous View Askew saga, which began with Clerks in 1994. The first ""different movie"" he made was a more serious comedy, Jersey Girl (2004), which was greeted with pretty mixed reactions. Now, two years after delivering his masterpiece (Clerks II), he does something different again, only this time it ain't serious: Zack and Miri Make a Porno may well be his most commercial flick to date (then again, his most successful opus is the controversial Dogma...), but, as the title indicates, it's also his rudest, most joyfully adult comedy.The plot, as one may imagine with Smith, is ridiculously simple: Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have known each other since the first grade and lived together since senior year, yet they have never slept together. Paying the bills becomes harder as the years go by, and an unconventional solution presents itself when the two go to a high school reunion and discover heartthrob Bobby Long (Brandon Routh, aka Bryan Singer's Superman) is dating a gay porn star (a freaking hilarious Justin Long). The idea is elementary: get the cash from a colleague, hire and old classmate (Jeff ""Randal"" Anderson) as your DP, cast the ""right"" people (Traci Lords, Katie Morgan and, uh, Jason Mewes) and you could be the next big name in adult entertainment. Problems ensue when Zack and Miri have to get intimate on camera: how will it affect their lifelong friendship?Ostensibly a fictitious retelling of Smith's own experiences when he made Clerks (shot in his working place at night with his high school friends as actors), Zack and Miri doesn't skimp on the more explicit content, with sex and nudity that was only mentioned in his previous films (thankfully, as anyone who has seen Clerks II knows). As usual, though, the real filth is all verbal, and the New Jersey director has never been more on form than when he transforms his favorite films (yes, even the sacred Star Wars) into conversation topics for the compulsory ""what name are we gonna give the movie?"" scene (R2-T-Bag and Darth Vibrator, anyone?). Nothing is untouchable or taboo when he is around (plus, it's doubtful Harvey Weinstein had any problems with the script, given he green-lit the project on the basis of the title alone), and in the mouths of his regular players (Anderson and Mewes, with the addition of a cameo by Mrs. Smith, Jennifer Schwalbach) the dialogue is as razor-sharp as it's ever been.And now, the ""but"" section. Actually, there's only one objection, the same that was raised with Jersey Girl: Smith hits the overdrive in the third act when he has to deal with the ""romantic"" aspects of the plot. It's less pinpointed than in his more serious film, but it's still there, exemplified by a schmaltzy soundtrack that seems to have been taken from Richard Curtis' private collection (nothing bad about Curtis, though: he knows how to use those things right). Fortunately, Smith can count on an asset that outweighs the excess of sentimentality in the amount that is necessary to save the film from being average: that is, he's got Seth Rogen. The role of Zack, as everyone must know, was written specifically for Judd Apatow's buddy, and the Canadian funny-man shows he deserved that kind of trust with a turn as charming and lovable as his performance in Knocked Up. The support he gets from Banks is valuable too, but fundamentally it is Rogen, and Rogen alone, who really rules the movie.Overall verdict: just as funny and crude (in a good way) as one has come to expect from Kevin Smith, and a very good movie to watch while waiting for Jay and Silent Bob to return.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
39,hu675,Amusing one-joke premise made enjoyable by the cast.,8,9 February 2009,"Zack (Seth Rogan) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are two long-time best friends, which they also share a apartment together. But they are deeply in debt, when they decide to go in their 10th anniversary High-School Reunion. Zack meets a flamboyant gay man (Justin Long), who tells him... he makes gay porn for a living. Which it gives Zack a idea to make a porno with his best friend to pay off their bills. At first, Miri thinks it is a wild solution but Zack convinces her... it might work. Zack asks his close friends (Craig Robertson & Jeff Anderson) to be the crew members and hire amateurish actors (Jason Mewes, Traci Lords, Katie Morgan & Kevin Mabe) to be in their porn actors. For Zack, Miri, The Cast & The Crew... it proves to be fun times until Zack and Miri start falling for each other and they complicated the porno shoot.Written and Directed by Kevin Smith (Clerks 1 & 2, Dogma, Jersey Girl) made an amusing light-hearted comedy with some laugh-out moments with one gross-out gag as well. Rogan and Banks as the leads can't do no wrong and it has an lively supporting cast. Although Smith's script turns somewhat serious in the third act and it is never as satisfying as you'd like it to be. Although a minor box office disappointment, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" should do extremely well on DVD and Blu-ray.The Two-Disc DVD Set, Disc One has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc One also includes 90 minutes of Deleted/ Extended Scenes!, which some are pretty funny nonetheless. Disc Two has a documentary with interviews with the cast and crew, Plenty of mini-featurettes and more. It is the first time that Smith and his producer Scott Mosier don't record a running commentary track of the movie, which it certainly needs one. Because Smith is a interesting guy to listen to. ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" isn't one of Kevin Smith's best movies (Although some may disagree) but it's often very funny and it is pretty good. Certainly worth a look. Long is a hoot in his wildly fun cameo. Mewes would make a convincing porn star. Two actors from the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", Tom Savini and David Early appears in cameos.

40,aidanratesmovies,"Surprisingly heartfelt, but not as good as it could have been",7,25 March 2020,"Although the film can be largely amusing throughout, Zack and Miri struggles to find a balance between its humor and plot without struggling. The film is largely full of some well thought out gags, many of which can lead to laughs, but as the film goes on, it seems to lose its sense of humor. The biggest problem with the film, is its predictability, which makes it frustrating to watch as time goes on and it finally makes it to the end. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks make for a great pair, however, and the two clearly capture the heartfelt energy the script does seem to be going for. At times, the emotional factor in the film can feel a bit forced, but by the end, it has you rooting for them all the way. In the end, Zack and Miri is not as good as a parody or a comedy as it could have been, but it is still full of a lot of laughs, and enough heart to satisfy, even if it doesn't always land in the right places.

41,TOMNEL,A sweet love story mixed with Kevin Smith's all too familiar writing.,6,13 December 2008,"If you've heard a conversation in one Kevin Smith film, then you've pretty much heard them all. Kevin Smith's writing obviously reflect his love for crude and sexual humor, and normally that's funny. It was actually pretty funny here for the most part, but it both grows tiring, and ruins the characters a bit. This movie can be qualified partially as a romantic comedy, but these characters are written to be such scum bags, romantic dialogue, or a romance at all seems too complicated for these crude characters.Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are best friends from school and even live together. Never have they been any more than friends. After they go to a school reunion and meet Brandon (Justin Long) a porno producer, their power and water is shut off. They decide to make a porno after learning from Brandon how profitable it can be. One scene calls for Zack and Miri to make love, but can they do it and still remain friends? It's fairly predictable...The writing is the part of this movie that I did not always enjoy. Every character was written the same, as is true for most of Kevin Smith's movies. Sure they have some different characteristics, but each character is crude, and loves going into dirty conversation no matter where they are. They are also unbelievably rude. I say unbelievable in the most literal sense, meaning their rudeness is not believable in normal characters. Saying rude things to coffee store patrons, and the patrons just shake them off like it's an everyday thing to be told off for no reason like that. It just adds up to that Kevin Smith only has one style of writing characters, and since he's started making movies, he has not strayed from his archetype.This wasn't a bad movie, though. The characters were often a bit too much, but this was actually really funny at times. It was sweet at times too, and when it wanted to be, it was sentimental. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks were good leads and played off each other well. The back-up cast of comedic actors featuring Smith regulars Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson, along with the Office's Craig Robinson add to the zaniness and bring their own touch to the crudeness they were given.Kevin Smith is not a bad writer. He's just one who writes all his characters to be fairly similar. They're all rude and very sex minded and foul mouthed, so much so that they sometimes stray from likability and from real life. His writing is even more repetitive now that every R-rated comedy out is one with crude characters like this, and Smith, who used to be the King of movies like this, is being replaced in popularity and reviews with Judd Appatow, and his buddy Seth Rogen. What else could Smith do but pretend to be an Appatow film by casting Appatow regulars in the lead? Maybe Smith should take a few years off to come up with a really good movie, and characters that aren't all exactly the same! My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. R for crude and sexual humor, nudity and language.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
42,Enchorde,"Inapporpiate, but funny",6,23 March 2010,"Recap: Zack and Miri are down on their luck, knee high in debt and with dead end jobs. Power and water has been cut and if they don't get some serious money they will be kicked out of their apartment. So they get the bright idea to enlist a few friends and make their own porno, a sure thing to get them some easy and quick money. But making a porno is a lot harder than it sounds which they soon find out.Comments: Wildly inappropriate but quite funny none the less. Kevin Smith have never bothered to keep on the right side of appropriate anyway, but has some talent for comedy. Obviously the jokes in this comedy is more or less of a sexual nature, and some of them are little too low to be real funny. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is also way to predictable and turn out to be too much of a romance than the comedy it started out to be.This is a little typical Kevin Smith movie (and yes Jason Mewes are in it too), but not the best he has made. The idea is great, but this time he hasn't managed to realize it to its full potential. Many of his earlier films about Jay and Silent Bob is much funnier, and just as inappropriate.6/10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

There's also a brilliant cameo from Justin Long and Brandon Routh that's just hilarious and Jason Mewes sheds his Jay persona to effectively be wonderfully entertaining yet again.The movie is in a tough spot.

44,valleyjohn,Another Kevin Smith disappointment,5,1 February 2009,"I have a bit of a love /hate relationship with Zack and Miri director Kevin Smith. I am an avid listener of his very funny and frank Smodcasts that he releases every couple of weeks ( i recommend you at least check one of them out) yet I'm not a fan of his movies. I didn't find Clerks as engaging as many people did. Dogma didn't do anything for me and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back does not appeal to my sense of humour. So i guess it does not take a genius to guess that i wasn't too keen on Zack and Miri make a porno either.Lifelong friends and roommates Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are facing hard times and a mountain of debt. When the electricity and plumbing get cut off, they seize upon the idea of making a homegrown porno movie for some quick cash, enlisting the help of their friends. The two vow that having sex will not ruin their friendship. But as filming begins, what started out as a business proposition between friends turns into something much more.Regular reader of my reviews will know that I'm sick and tired of Seth Rogan movies. He seems to play the exact same guy in every single film and it's wearing way to thin for my liking. The saving grace with Zack and Miri is that co star Elizabeth Banks ( Miri) makes this film almost bearable to watch. She has a charming screen presence and a smile that will light up any film but that does beg the question what on earth is she doing with a guy like Zack. I suppose that's the point of the movie but i have seen it all before .Kevin Smith again employs his old sidekick Jason Mewes who plays amateur porno star Lester. Not the first person that would spring to mind when picking someone to play a porn star but to his credit he pulls it off ( maybe that not the most appropriate expression to use!).The funniest scenes in the film are not sex related at all but are when Delaney and his wife come out with their racial rants.I would have also have liked to have seen more of Zack and Delaney's boss , Mr. Surya. He's only on screen for five minutes but they are the funniest five minutes of the film. His parting words to his useless employees is. ""I hate you ebony and ivory motherf***ers!"" Now that's funny.It's strange that a very funny man like Kevin Smith is unable to transfer his unique brand of humour into the big screen but i have not given up hope on him yet . I just hope next time Kevin Smith makes a comedy he decides to work with a new cast because despite his undeniable talent we are all a little sick of Seth Rogan.5 out of 10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Back then I knew Kevin Smith just by name (I saw just a couple of months ago my first and second Kevin Smith movie when I finally saw Clerks and later Clerks 2) but I was already a fan of Seth Rogen and had desires to watch Clerks, in other words this movie always looked to me very attractive. Released in the US on Halloween but just released in my city last Friday (was about time f****** a*****es), Smith's latest directorial effort features part of Apatow's ""family"", certainly not only Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks (who, as you already know, stars as Zack and Miri, friends since they were kids and now roommates but still ONLY friends, nothing of nothing, keep your dirty feelings deep inside!) but also Craig Robinson and Gerry Bednob.

Thank you so much"") so here we also have Jay and Randal from the View Askewniversewell not really, we just have both Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson (Mewes is quite memorable and hilarious as Lester the Molester Cockenschtuff), having all of these guys the fun is certainly guaranteed. And what about the plot of the movie? Well, roommates Zack and Miri are out of money, lots of bills, a reason to think not only their former schoolmates will be extremely interested in seeing a porno with them, the same reason why a gay porn actor (the most recent Superman, Brandon Routh, and Justin Long are just hilarious as the gay couple) recognizes Miri as the youtube star she is now. Anyway, sure we had seen this before, sure we know how things will end, we know there will be happy ending for Zack and Miri (according to the wikipedia synopsis: ""They marry, and start their own video production company, Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, which makes amateur videos for couples"". Damn, I didn't stay for the end credits!) but this is still a really hilarious, and certainly worth watching, film. Being a fan of Judd Apatow's first directorial effort The 40 Year Old Virgin, of ""Knocked"""" (I hope I can be seeing Funny People, the upcoming third film of Apatow that also has Seth Rogen in it, the day it gets the theatrical release in my city), etc., I couldn't do anything but enjoy this film, still for me is not superior to those mentioned films or to Clerks but you better check it out!",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
47,Sandcooler,"""I'm a delivery man, and I have some cream for you""",8,6 July 2009,"Kevin Smith's crude jokes have always been strangely amusing to me, but now they've actually got themselves a plot they belong in. The idea of having amateurs stumble through the production of a porno movie is so simple that I'm surprised nobody thought of it sooner. It just feels so out there. So essentially this movie has every possible gag about incompetent film making that you can think of, which got plenty of laughs out of me. The cast also helps a lot in this. Everyone really seems like they're having a lot of fun with this project, especially Jason Mewes is doing pretty great as some kind of reinterpreted Jay. Towards the ending the movie turns into some kind of love story, but this isn't as irritating as some have claimed. The porn thing was getting old anyway, and the leads make it work. I never found it corny, I never wished it would just end. It was rather sweet in fact. This is actually pretty good.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

I liked this film.It's like most movies of the kind, a mix of raunchy over the top comedy and intelligent comedy, as well as romance.The plot involves two friends(a guy and a girl) who are broke and need to pay their bills.They decide to go into the porn business and make a porno together, along with some of their friends and some new people, they start it.The friends say the sex will not jeprodize their friendship, however...it does.The basic plot is a lot like the 1997 Trey Parker film ""Orgazmo"".Is it a good movie? Yes. It has it's hilarious moments, though I think it could have been a bit better. But overall good work from Smith and Rogen.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
49,brando647,Fantastic Casting Makes This Porno Worth It,7,3 March 2009,"As I have stated in multiple other comments on this site, I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and when I heard he was going to have Seth Rogen (in my opinion, one of the funniest actors in recent film) in his latest film I was excited. Smith has the ability to add heart to even the most vulgar of stories and he outdoes himself here. Just as the title of the movie insinuates, lifetime friends Zack and Miri are near broke and a visit to their high school reunion inspires them to create an adult film to solve their financial crisis.Twenty minutes into this movie, I was completely desensitized to vulgar dialogue. Once the characters began listing off all the potential film titles for their porno, it was as if the taboo of dirty language just disappeared in a sea of innuendo. So, to answer peoples' question regarding ""Is this movie safe for my younger _________?"", I would have to emphatically say NO. For those of us who are of age, this movie is still pretty funny. It's definitely not Smith's funniest film, but it's not his worst either. I found the movie to be infinitely quotable and I noticed that I seemed to enjoy the movie a little bit more each time I watched it.The real highlight of this movie is the cast! It was a Kevin Smith film with a Judd Apatow cast, an awesome combination. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks are the title characters and I found that the two of them had fantastic chemistry together. Rogen was terrific but it was Banks that really sold me on their relationship. She really brought the tenderness to Smith's film with her great performance. In addition to the headliners, the film also has Smith regulars Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson (though Anderson's role is much smaller than his usual Randall Graves performance). Craig Robinson steals scenes as Delaney, Zack's co-worker and producer and, for a touch of realism, Smith went so far as to cast real-life porn stars Katie Morgan (HOT) and Traci Lords as supporting roles. One would normally believe that porn stars have no business in a genuine acting role but they manage to run with the cast and do a great job.I'll admit, I thought there were a few more loose ends that I wish Smith had tied up at the end of the film, but then the movie WAS more about the relationship between Zack and Miri with their porn as a tool to help them realize their feelings. Despite that the film isn't nearly as good as some of Smith's previous works and the language will probably turn some people off of the film, it's still a good movie with a great cast and plenty of emotion scattered amongst the sex scenes.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
50,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" shows classic Kevin Smith humor and dialog along with growth as a visual storyteller. Hilarious and outrageous!",9,1 April 2009,"In ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", lifelong platonic friends since first-grade Zack (Seth Rogan) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are facing a bit of a financial crisis when they don't have enough money to pay the bills for their apartment. But one night, at a High School reunion, the pair run into an old classmate who is involved romantically with an adult-film star and the idea emerges- the two could make and sell a pornographic video to pay bills. Soon, this bizarre misadventure goes awry with zany characters and the revelation that our two heroes may actually have deeper feelings for each other than they are willing to admit.This is writer/director Kevin Smith's eighth film, and only his second to not take place within his ""View Askewniverse"" (which was started in 1994 with his debut film ""Clerks"") universe of characters. However, don't be fooled, this is truly a Kevin Smith film if ever I've seen one, and I have. All the witty dialog and fantastic character development that made the ""Clerks"" films great, and made ""Chasing Amy"" shine is still there. But Kevin Smith has grown in another way, and that is his visual storytelling.With ""Zack and Miri"", Smith really shows some gusto and some excellent strides with the visual aspect of the film. While his past films have had some good visuals, story and character have taken the front seat. Here, Smith balances amazing (and sometimes disturbingly funny) sight gags with his talents of writing characters, and it comes off near perfect.Banks and Rogan are both fantastic in their roles, and they develop their characters perfectly. This film (released in 2008) marks the second consecutive year that Rogan has been in my favorite team-up or film couple of the year, after the excellent 2007 film ""Knocked Up."" Rogan is the perfect funny guy who every guy can relate to, and Banks is both beautiful and real, two things that sometimes don't go hand-in-hand. She plays her role with a dead-on sense of humor, and it's easy to forget that she's even Elizabeth Banks- you just think she's Miri. The same could be said for Rogan's Zack.There is a large supporting cast as well, filled with colorful characters...We have: Craig Robinson as Delaney, Zack's co-worker who becomes the projects producer, and steals a large number of scenes with his spot-on delivery and timing.Smith Regular Jason Mewes as Lester, a dim-witted young man hired to co-star in Zack and Miri's porno flick.Another Smith Regular in Jeff Anderson as Deacon, a videographer hired to shoot the movie.Traci Lords as ""Bubbles"", a ""performer"" with a unique ""talent."" and Katie Morgan as Stacey, another co-star of the picture.All of the supporting actors and actresses do their parts well, and there is not a ""sore thumb"" sticking out anywhere.Now, I should probably bring up something this film will be notorious for, and that is its extreme content. This film does contain depictions of pornographic films being shot, and for a mainstream R-rated film, it is fairly extreme. But looking at the heart of the movie, you can easily let anything in it that you find offensive slide. This is a movie with a great heart and a dirty mind, like many of Kevin Smith's other films.All in all, this film was a very pleasant surprise for me, and I cannot wait to add it to my DVD collection. As a fan of Kevin Smith and the actors and actresses involved, I give this a very good 9 out of 10!",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
51,oneguyrambling,"Too much potty mouthed rom, not enough potty mouthed com...",5,27 December 2010,"This is where Kevin Smith started believing his own press and got lazy. I can see him chuckling to himself as he came up with the title.""You guys think I'm gross and only do fluid and fart jokes? Well how about I make a movie about the porn industry and just go balls out (literally and figuratively) to do exactly that?!?"" Zack and Miri are 2 late 20-something losers. They have dead end jobs, no cash and live in a shared squalid apartment and share a sh*tty old busted car.They are not together, have never been ""together"" and basically share a lifelong friendship of convenience, but no side-benefits.After a school reunion that shows each of them how far they haven't come, and the fact that zero cashflow has resulted in their house losing water and power, and that they will be evicted if they don't come up with the rent, Zack suggests they make some quick cash So we get the inevitable jokes from coming up with a title for the porno, casting, setbacks to production, low budget techniques to save money, costuming and the fact that many people will be having sex in front of others on camera.All hilarious right? This thing writes itself.Well it must have done, because apart from some chuckles and the compulsory gross-out bits there just isn't much that separates this from the pack.I was fully on board when this was released, I thought Kevin Smith would make this hilarious and show that he isn't just a hack with a knack for low-brow humour and clever erudite dialogue, then I watched this Then he made Cop Out. Now I just can't be sure.Still there are things to take away from Zack and Miri: Elizabeth Bank can play, cute, sexy, funny, serious and smutty and you like her at all times. Not a bad effort for someone who before this was ""the chick in the g-string in the 40 Year old Virgin"".Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen, for good and bad, I am positive his shtick and endearingly annoying laugh will get old. Soon. I have the over/under at two more films, and I am betting on under.Justin Long is a better actor than he gets credit for, but eventually he will be in some great films, he's just not good looking enough to headline most of them though.Kevin Smith has fallen for the ""name recognition"" trap. He is now a big enough director to make calls to actors and get them to agree to appear in his films, he unfortunately then thinks that is enough and forgets to write them good dialogue or create memorable scenes and situations for them to appear in.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. If you think the title is funny you will chuckle a few times and laugh a couple. If you think the title is crass and you won't like it you are already right. This is a potty-mouthed rom-com with clumsily done rom and not enough com.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

53,PimpinAinttEasy,Nice entertainment ..... but nowhere close to Smith's best .....,6,23 August 2016,"I liked this film a lot. Elizabeth Banks is a very competent actress. Kevin Smith is one filmmaker whose films I never miss. I dislike Seth Rogen with a vengeance - I simply do not buy his comedy act. He comes across as a really cruel person who is trying hard to play an regular nice guy. This is just intensely subjective personal opinion.Anyway, while I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think about the French writer Michel Houellebecq. He is someone who has been critical about Western sexual liberation. So Zack and Miri is about a platonic couple who decide to make a porno film to escape poverty. I know its not supposed to be taken seriously beyond a certain level. And I am not really a conservative person. But Houellebecq's books have had an impact on the way I looked at sexual liberation. It basically creates haves and have nots - some people are getting laid, but some aren't. This is trivialized in the film. And the film seems to suggest that even ugly people do get laid.I am sure I am seeing too much into all this. It is just supposed to be an entertaining movie, I guess. And I did find it to be quite entertaining, though it is nowhere as good as Clerks or Chasing Amy. Before I forget, I liked the way Kevin Smith used the guitar solo from the Pixies song ""Hey"" in this film. It was a nice touch.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
54,Sirus_the_Virus,Justin Long.,8,24 August 2009,"Justin Long makes a brief appearance in Zach and Miri make a porno. His appearance in the film is the best performance in the entire film. There are tons of good performances. But Long is incredibly genius at playing a gay man. As a matter of fact, Long's performance may have come close to making the movie for me. What's weird is that Justin Long isn't a main character. Long plays a gay porn director. The main characters in the film are Zach(Seth Rogen) and Miri(Elizabeth Banks). But let alone, Justin Long's performance could make the movie for you. Comic genius Kevin Smith brings us a different kind of film. Zach and Miri is still incredibly dirty and crude. At times, it's really disgusting. But Zach and Miri make a porno is actually a somewhat romance. I was happy to see some of the people form Smith's other films in this like Jeff Anderson and Jason Mewes. Zach and Miri is absolutely hilarious with one scene or two that will make you gag. There's one scene where they're filming and this chick takes a dump on this guys face. Most people may not appreciate Kevin Smith's newest film, but I think you should see it. I know it sounds gross, but it's awesome.The Plot: Zach and Miri, roommates who have known each other since the first grade, go broke. To make money, they decide to make a porno. While filming, they realize that they are truly in love.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
55,jaredmobarak,This ain't Amistad  Zach and Miri Make a Porno,8,9 October 2008,"Kevin Smith has attempted to break free from the viewaskewniverse once more with his new comedy Zach and Miri Make a Porno. The script is a tad disjointed, broken into very distinct acts, finishing with a very self-reflexive moment as the characters try to find an ending for their film at the same time Smith puts the pieces together for his own. However, while the parts may not gel as smoothly as one would wish, they are all held together by the two lead roles doing what's need in order to make ends meet. Whatever problems there may be with structure, there are none at all as far as dialogue and humor. This thing is definitely a Kevin Smith movie; there can be no mistaking that fact.It really does take place in four sections, the first of which becomes the prologue to the story, an introduction to our leads and their friends as both try to prepare for their ten-year high school reunion. We learn their relationship history, their ticks and idiosyncrasies, as well as their trust in one another. This part sets up the premise of the rest of the movie, leading these two onto a road towards pornography for cash. Part two involves the process of getting a low-budget porno off the ground with casting, financing, costume design, and script writing. I don't want to ruin the eventual epiphany onto what the subject matter should be, (they want a dirty version of an existing movie, and if you know your Kevin Smith, you might be able to figure it out), but the rehearsals are fantastic. The third act is where it all starts to come undone as filming begins, personalities clash, and feelings get trampled on. It all leads into the climatic moment when our leads face the decision we all know will crop up sooner or laterthat question of whether a guy and a girl can ever truly be just best friends. Credit Smith for getting it all to that point, even if the transitions are abrupt between the three quarters, but chide him a little for then tacking on the conclusion like an afterthought. Part four works, don't get me wrong, I just wish it could have been handled a bit smoother than with a ""3 months later"" caption.The film definitely hinges on the ability of Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks to carry it all through. This is a feat considering both are brand new in the Smith universe. Usually we have the stalwarts playing leads with viewaskew virgins rounding out the supporting cast to possibly be expanded later on. Here, though, Rogen and Banks take the steering wheel and chug along as two friends that have been together since school. Banks is very charismatic and does show-up the rest of the cast at times with her ability to convey emotion so well. No disrespect to Rogen, but the guy isn't Marlon Brando. He knows his place and does it very well. I will say he surprised me a bit with some range, but if you like him or hate him, Seth is being Seth here. And that works, because these two need to seem comfortable with each other; they both act like they've been friends forever and that goes a long way in making it all seem believable.Of course, no matter how good the leads are, a Smith film relies heavily on the supporting cast. Rules are rules and they are not broken here. ""The Office's"" Craig Robinson steals many scenes from his counterparts with that same deadpan self-righteous black man, ""is he serious or not"" rhetoric as in the television show. His delivery is perfect at every turn and when he dances at a cast party  pure gold. As for the rest, I really enjoyed Justin Long as a gay porn star, so out in the open that when he tries to be ""straight"" it just becomes hilarious. Thinking that being macho is speaking slow and in a deep voice, his back and forth with Brandon Routh (who kept reminding me of Dan Futterman from The Birdcage in his mannerisms, not sure if that is good or bad, but it did distract me for some reason) is enjoyable and when he recognizes ""Granny Panties"" at the reunion, it is pure jubilance.Mention is deserved for a couple more small parts. Tyler Labine kills as a drunk Bean-N-Gone coffee customer barging in while the troupe is filming a sex scene. His oblivious reactions to everything and need to talk about the Steelers game is hilarious. The facial responses of the group watching this kid walk in on them makes it even more priceless as their horror juxtaposed with his total blank emotional state works great. Also, what Smith film is complete without the obligatory cameos of his friends? Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson make appearances and both are natural and vintage  them.So while it is not a startling rebirth for the man that helped usher in the era of the indie comedy, it is definitely a good step forward into new territory not bogged down with an existing history as his viewaskew stories are. The only really horrible thing about the movie for me was the atrocious font used in the opening creditsit made me cringe. Otherwise, this is a very funny film that will offend some sensibilities while opening the world to even more one-liners and unforgettable set-pieces. I hope the movie does well, because if Smith gets his creative juices flowing, we can only end up with creative stuff. If bad press and disappointed fanboys keep making him go back to the well (which did work in spades for Clerks 2) he is bound to not be able to keep it up.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
56,hall895,Rather raunchy...and rather sweet,8,12 April 2009,"Look at the title of the film. Look at who directed it. You know going in that this is not going to be a sweet romance film. Except that's pretty much exactly what it turns out to be. OK, as romances go this is an exceptionally raunchy one but it is a Kevin Smith film so that is to be expected. This is after all the man who in his last feature found a rather unusual way to work a donkey into the script. All the vulgar humor can't hide the fact that this is a film which has a lot of heart. It's a feel-good movie which just happens to have lots of swearing, plenty of sex and one notably disgusting gag involving a bodily function perhaps better left to the imagination.As you might have guessed from the film's title Zack and Miri make a porno. Who are Zack and Miri? Well, they're the best of friends, have been since first grade. They've been living together for years but they're just friends. Just the thought of a romantic relationship appears to be enough to make them queasy. As we meet them they are about to attend their ten year high school reunion after which they will be forced to face the fact that their lives really aren't going particularly well. They have lousy jobs, live in a lousy apartment and they're pretty much flat broke. The obvious solution is to make a porno. Well maybe that would not be the obvious solution in most films but again this is Kevin Smith we're talking about.Zack and Miri are played by Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks and the pair have obvious chemistry. Rogen's wonderfully endearing and Banks is the quintessential girl next door. If, you know, the girl next door made porn. The lead couple are surrounded by a mostly wonderful supporting cast. Craig Robinson is hilarious as the producer of this homemade porno who really has no idea what it is a producer does. Smith staple Jeff Anderson is around and he does a fine job. Jason Mewes is as crazy as ever. Crazier even if that's possible. Justin Long really only appears in one scene but he threatens to steal the whole show. His straight-faced delivery of some truly outrageous lines is remarkable. And for someone who makes her living making real pornos Katie Morgan is up to the task when asked to actually act. OK, perhaps portraying a stripper turned porn star isn't a stretch for her but she is funny and makes you think she could actually have a future doing this. She definitely outshines Traci Lords, who seems rather bored throughout the proceedings. Everyone else appears to have had a rollicking good time making the film though.It's a movie which is not particularly dramatic. Anyone can figure out two minutes into the film where this is all inevitably headed. But it's a fun journey getting there. In fact you'll wish you could spend a little more time with these characters, especially as after the big dramatic climax the film rushes towards a rather sudden, abrupt ending. The movie's chugging along and then seemingly out of nowhere it's over. In the end it's a sweet, charming story but it's still a Kevin Smith film so you get everything that entails...great dialogue, lots of big laughs, plenty of curse words, a Star Wars scene and Jason Mewes letting it all hang out. Smith will cross any line for a joke and never care about who might take offense. Yet he still managed to make a film which never loses its heart and which really makes you feel for its characters. It's the rare film which can be both thoroughly charming and thoroughly vulgar. Smith pulls it off wonderfully.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
57,Karl Self,Conservative,7,22 August 2009,"Today, thanks to the internet, pornography is ubiquitous, and this necessarily shapes the attitude of the generation that grew up with it. Having 10,000 different varieties of, say, Micronesian dwarfs gang-rogering an submissive Alaskan donkey up the ear canal, if that's your bag, only a mouse-click away, is necessarily going to affect you one way or another. Unisex slacker flatmates Zack (a fat dude) and Miri (a well fit female) have spent the last ten years dropping out, tuning in, serving coffee, and callously bantering about sick stuff, for example self-gratification gadgets such as the Fleshlight (a male relief aid that is a cross over between a lady's uglies and a torch, in case you've just returned from Mars or pretend not to know). But all this loose talk doesn't mean that the time-honored game of hide-the-kreplach with the Schickse of your predilection has become any less nerve-wrecking than 100 years ago. In a way, it has become worse because the internet leaves you in no doubt about how, while you haven't been getting any for the past decade, others are getting their tops and fingers on a very regular basis. ""Regular basis"" being a euphemism for hardcore penetrative sex with an entire cheerleader troupe of 18-year-old Asian nymphettes with no self respect or gagging reflex.But I digress. Zack and Miri have been hanging out for some time whilst going nowhere fast, when the fascist utilities company cuts them off just because they haven't paid their bills for a year or so. When Miri finds out that her highschool heartthrob is now a gay porn-star, Zack has an incredibly great idea completely out of nowhere: let's pay the bills ... by also becoming porn-stars. Easier done than said, they get a few social dropouts together and start making porn. And, while they're at it, they decide to also bring their talents to the fore. At this point they both discover that they are a lot coyer than they think, and the director must have had similar feelings: the movie suddenly becomes very tame, and calls upon every porn cliché in the book. Director Kevin Smith has apparently missed out on that entire new-fangled internet wachumacallit, or maybe his pornographic education ended with 1980ies VHS porn, because his porn still has squeaky-voiced bimboes acting in ""You must be the plumber, here to lay a pipe""-scenes.To cut the whole story short, Zack and Miri do a very un-pornographic shagging scene which makes them fall in love. They can't admit this to each other, split up, and finally fall into each other's arms at the end. The end.The reactionary bit is that a.) Miri stays fully dressed during the entire scene (a small reminder for all you puritan Americans out there: sex just works a lot better when you take your clothes off). Point b.) is that Kevin Smith clearly has no respect for the porn ""industry"" because he portrays the actresses as brainless bimbos, the actors as brainless him-bos, and porn as something that you can film with a wobbly DV camera and still make a fortune with. It would have been nice to simply see an alternative, less jaded view of the industry that's provided us all with many hours of solitary fun. I also thought it was a bit reactionary to cast the male part with a fat slob (sorry, Seth Rogen, you know I love you!) and the female part with a pristine beauty who would could equally well model for Vogue.ZAMMAP is still watchable because Kevin Smith is a great filmmaker who could make a gripping documentary about the drying of paint on a humid day, because of the witty dialogue, and because of the great acting. Craig Robinson as Zack and Miri's motor-mouthed ""disgruntled black dude"" senior coworker coming especially to mind here.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
58,KnightsofNi11,Kevin Smith unexpectedly hits a raunchy home run,8,6 July 2011,"Few directors can make me laugh as much as Kevin Smith does. He's taken flak for pretty much everything after Clerks. but I completely disagree. I've seen all of his films except for one and the only one that is a complete piece of crap is Cop Out and he didn't even write that film. But before he dropped that massive turd he released Zack and Miri Make a Porno, the heartwarming tale about two lifelong friends who decide to have sex for money. They've been friends since the first grade and have lived together for years. When they begin to get desperate for cash they decide they only have one option left. Make a porno. So they enlist the help of a friend to finance the film and then go on a hunt for a cast which includes everyone from Jason Mewes, better known as Jay only this time minus the Silent Bob, to Katie Morgan, a real life porn star. The film is hilarious and yet amongst all its vulgarity and obscenity it somehow manages to have a lot of heart.After watching Cop Out I began to forget why I enjoyed Kevin Smith films. Then I watched Zack and Miri Make a Porno and I was reminded all over again. Kevin Smith's screen writing ability. This film has all the vulgar wit and disgusting cleverness that Kevin Smith is a master at. It is filled with pop culture references and things to make any movie nerd smile. There is an entire stretch where Zack and Miri attempt to name their porno, trying to make it a spoof of an existing movie name. The things they come up with are hysterical and perfectly highlight Kevin Smith's extreme nerdiness as well as his incredible wit.The film's script also has that very real world cadence to it that makes you believe these are people having actual conversations instead of actors reading lines. This kind of dialect is under-appreciated and takes a lot more skill to write than a script from another time period. If you have a film set in Ancient Greek times the dialogue has to sound like it is from that time period, but the screenwriter can get away with a lot more because none of us have ever lived in Ancient Greece. A film set in modern day has to sound like it is from modern day, but we all know how we talk and we know if a script is realistic or not because it is what we experience every day. Kevin Smith knows this and he capture the real life cadence perfectly, making an outrageous film about normal people making a porno actually believable.Zack and Miri Make a Porno has some corny jokes every once in a while but it is actually incredibly funny. Its outrageousness makes it so much fun to watch and I laughed out loud plenty of times, emphasis on the loud. It gets a little sappy towards the end, but the film possesses some little spark that makes me love it. It's a film with a big heart that seems very out of place with the subject matter but its this uniqueness that makes me enjoy it so much. If you're easily offended steer clear of this movie, but if you have a sense of humor then this is an incredibly fun film.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

62,witster18,"Chemistry, Funny Script, but A Couple of unnecessary gross-outs pull it down a notch.",6,1 March 2011,"It seems a bit ridiculous to talk about whether a movie made about making a porno is tastefully done, but it has been done before. Boogie Nights and the comedy from a few years back, 'The Girl Next Door', were both films that weren't really crude or overly offensive for this genre - even though there was zero doubt that they deserved their R-rating. To be honest, 'Zack and Miri' has a lot of heart and more likable characters than those previously mentioned films, however, there are two scenes in Zack and Miri that Kevin Smith should have left out of the movie. One involves R2D2's dangling friends, and another involves someone defecating on someone else's face. The weird thing is that I have zero issue with full-frontal nudity of either sex, and zero issue with the sex scenes. As a matter of fact, they could have gotten away with more in terms of the sex scenes had they not pushed the envelope with those completely unnecessary and flat-out-crude moments in this film.That said, I liked this movie. The characters are great, the script is very good, and Seth Rogan is definitely on top of his game here. The interaction between the two leads comes off as genuine( a hard feat when you're talking about these BEAUTIFUL girl/ugly guy match ups - ex.Shallow Hal, Knocked Up, She's OUt of My League, Etc) This is unquestionably a good sleeper comedy. I think if Kevin leaves out the two scenes I give this film an 8 without hesitation, but each of those scenes is sooo over-the-top out of place compared to the rest of the movie that it really hurts this film.It was much funnier than anticipated, and I'm glad that I caught it on Showtime last night. That said, this film is too good to dumb-up and use gross 'Waiting-like' sight gags to sell itself. The story, the language, and the nudity is shock-value enough. We don't need to see the unnecessary gross stuff that just doesn't fit into this otherwise heartfelt and hilarious film.recommended. 64/100 You'll like it if you liked: The Girl Next Door, She's Out of My League, Clerks, and MallRats.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

But the problem is, that the movie never manages to be particularly hilarious, all though it does offer some laughs.In all, the film is well made, but at least I didn't find it that funny and as it was supposed to be comedy, I just didn't find it that interesting film to watch.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

In a typical Kevin Smith film the group sticks together and tosses the one after the other off-colored comment at each other whilst doing their best at making this odd situation work out. Also typical is the plethora of references to other films and the way it works out in a funny way.All in all this film is a typical film for Smith who does an OK job, but nothing really brilliant like he did with Clerks.

As expected they were the best thing about the film and I can't fault their performances. The characters were funny and the dialogue between them was good. They had a brilliant chemistry which I enjoyed watching.Overall though I think the rest of the humour just missed the mark for me a bit.

There once was a play called Sexual Perversity in Chicago which was tamed and made into a movie called About Last Night. There was also a few sex talk scenes in the movie closer that were pretty shocking. Take the play and the sex talk from Closer and make it one big running gag for an hour and a half leading up to someone getting crapped on in the face and you have Zach and Miri. Elizabeth Banks is so miscast. She's a beautiful woman with straight teeth and a perfect hair-do. Why is she slacking with Zach and burning garbage in a can to stay warm? She doesn't come off as desperate, she's not convincing as a squatter. A really good movie about the porn industry is Boogie Nights. This one has a few laughs at the beginning, but is even pretty disgusting for someone who has just about seen it all.

The unique thing about this movie is that it shows you that Kevin Smith can still write some of the most vulgar and entertaining movies of this generation.

They are friends who live in poverty in a flat in Pennsylvania. They decide to make a porn film.The plot is implausible. There's no way that an articulate, hot girl would want anything to do with an unattractive, overweight, coarse idiot - let alone choose to live in poverty with him. For them to then have sex on film - when they've never been sexually attracted to each other - stretches the ridiculous plot further. They then push things even further into the unbelievable by falling in love with each other and marrying. The backstory is ridiculous. We're supposed to believe that hot Miri has never been popular and that very unappealing Zack has never been attracted to her throughout the years that they've been best friends. Early in the film, Zack and Miri attend their high school reunion. This is implausible due to the fact that unpopular, unsuccessful people don't go to their school reunions. Zack and Miri aren't believable as friends, flatmates, porn co-stars or as a couple. The film starts off as a sex comedy, but later makes a preposterous and uncomfortable jolt into being a romantic drama.

True the comparisons between this and a Judd Apatow movie can definitely be seen, even both leading actors were in ""The 40 year old Virgin"" (2005).

SO, with such a BIG NAME cast, and from what I heard from people who watched it years ago, I EXPECTED a cute RomCom where they came up with the idea of making a porno, but never ACTUALLY went through with it...Boy was I WRONG! This movie is NOT a typical Seth Rogan funny borderline family flick! Not only is there NUDITY, but there's a LOT of FULL ON SEX happening in this movie! I'm fighting the urge to remove the title RomCom because I really believe that that's what it was meant to be, but they went so far beyond RomCom and it's so disappointing, and I'm afraid that people will see that and think that this movie it's different than what it actually is. I think quite honestly this movie deserves an X rating. Even if you were to block out the nudity and there is a lot of it, you still have so many of the sex scenes and a lot of storyline for the movie is actually woven into the sex scenes so that you can't take those out you'd Miss part of the story!

75,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Deceptive. Absolutely sweet while still being dirty as you can get.,9,30 October 2008,"I love deceptive marketing campaigns. Usually, they make movies hit-or-misses financially, but deceptive marketing shows a lot of faith in a film, which is what every viewer should have in this one. Have faith in the fact that this film, despite being controversial and borderline wrong in some parts, is one of the funniest and sweetest romantic comedies of the decade. What happens when you mix Kevin Smith's witty and snappy dialog with the outrageous humor of a guy like Seth Rogen? Pure brilliance, that's what.Z&M is a movie of depth and emotion. Yes, I'm talking about the movie with the extremely blunt title. What I like about both of our 'names', Smith and Rogen, is that no matter how raunchy they get, no matter how much they cross the line, they have a habit of making their films have real heart. It's the same here, and it looks like everyone involved had fun making the film...in every sense of the word...What makes the movie work so well is the amazing platonic and romantic chemistry of the two leads, Rogen and Elizabeth Banks (who is quickly becoming one of my favorites). I can't think of two performers who have skyrocketed more in terms of fame over the last three years, and to see them together again after The 40 Year Old Virgin was a good treat. They work so well together that I found myself smiling at them in pretty much every scene they share (or, 80% of the movie), and it makes the experience so much better. They really make you feel comfortable and warm inside (I can hear the sex jokes coming already).It's not just our wonderful leads that make the movie great, it's performers like Jason Mewes (playing a variant of his usual 'Jay' character), Jeff Anderson, and Craig Robinson that really help, because any scene without Banks & Rogen together has Robinson or Mewes, who form a type of foundation for the great performances of Banks & Rogen. Of course, the film features a few porn stars and a few cameos as well, the best coming from Justin Long and Brandon Routh. I was dying.Of course, not only do you get heart with Rogen and Smith, but you get surefire jaw dropping jokes that will make you say, ""did they really just do that?"". One of the jokes I'm speaking of comes at Jeff Anderson's expense. The vulgarity of Rogen's comic style, mixed with Smith's wicked fast writing is the perfect compliment and a great recipe for laughter. Z&M certainly won't deliver as many laughs as films like Superbad or Knocked Up, but that's mostly because the film is more serious, desperate, and shorter (but of course, still very light hearted).I guess the only thing I didn't like was the lack of resolution with the subplot of the actual porno, but that's just wishful thinking, as the end is more than satisfying (as well as clever and hilarious). People are obviously going to be hesitant about seeing this movie because of the blunt title and risqué plot, which in of itself is hilarious, but these reluctant people need to realize that the sex is outweighed by the love, and the raunch outweighed by the righteousness. Zack & Miri Make A Porno is one of the best romantic comedies of the decade, as well as of the year. It's a fun, sweet, heartfelt raunchfest that will leave you laughing your ass off and having a good time.

76,Jerghal,The Reverse Career of Kevin Smith - Part 8,6,11 April 2014,"The whole Kev Smith gang's here and that is probably the best part of the film. The story itself is simple and very predictable. Zack & Miri are lifelong friends since high-school, but never amounted to anything so they need money and the quickest way is to make a porn film. Don't expect (much) nudity, it's still an R rated Hollywood production, not an NC-17 'real' porn movie. Rogen acts like he always acts (he's no Pacino), Banks is a lot better but she can only work with what's written. All in all a mediocre film. Kevin Smith seems to be a director who's career goes in reverse: his first film Clercks was his masterpiece and every new film he's made since has been worse than the previous one.

77,rlaine,Combines cute and explicit quite well,5,25 August 2010,"I'm yet to see a bad movie from Kevin Smith. None of the new movies has excelled Clerks, but he's an auteur in Hollywood and that's pretty respectable.What makes this movie incredibly strange is the fact that it falls into the category of cute films, while it revolves around a subject that is everything but cute. And I'm not talking about falling in love.Incidentally I just recently watched two very similar movies, Ten Inch Hero (2007) and Entry Level (2007). All of these movies combine a group of characters with different backgrounds - somekind of a comedic motley crew. It's a very ""cute"" scenario, always kind of fascinating and fun to watch.This scenario has been the running force of many sitcoms and TV movies, but I think this is the first bigger production I've seen built around this setup, and surprisingly it works. It's heartfelt, cute, still very raunchy and doesn't feel like a low budget movie.What tunes this movie down a bit is the fact that some of the scenes go a bit too far. I'm all for explicit humour, but there are a couple of images I'd rather not seen. Talking about one scene in particular.Considering the target audience (who don't care much about age limits), this movie takes a serious subject a bit lightly. What eventually makes people in this movie happy and wealthy, might make ones life a living hell in the real world (=private video shared in the web).",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
78,gregeichelberger,It takes more than F-bombs and bad sex to make a good comedy,4,4 November 2008,"Halloween is over. Kevin Smith trying to be Judd Apatow just isn't working.Plus, after viewing the newest cinematic comedy to emerge from Tinseltown, ""Zack & Miri (Make a Porno),"" I felt like I had just rolled on the floor of an adult theater – I was so dirty I almost had to go home and watch ""Citizen Kane"" just to wash away the gook on my soul.And while there were a few early laughs in this Smith-directed effort (his first film since the horrid ""Clerks II"" and ""Jersey Girl""), one gets a really bad feeling when the actual soft-core stuff starts kicking in.Zack (Seth Rogen, ""Knocked Up,"" ""Pineapple Express"") and Miri (Elizabeth Banks, ""Invincible,"" ""Spider-Man 3"") are platonic roommates who live in a run-down Pittsburgh apartment.They sleep in separate rooms, she wakes him up and they go to work. Neither seems to have much motivation as the unpaid bills far outnumber those which have been settled. Zack ""works"" at a local coffee house with militant, racist friend, Delaney (Craig Robinson).The movie does not say what Miri does to support the household, but I immediately questioned why she would want to live with a fat, bloated, bearded, unkempt, idiotic loser like Zack. The only thing missing for Rogen's character here is a huge smoking bong.Even at his job he screws around, steals coffee and abuses customers. Who in their right mind would hire or keep a person like this around? Hollywood is an amazing place, isn't it?One night, the two attend their 10th annual high school reunion and while Miri embarrassingly throws herself at a former football star she used to have a crush on, Zack strikes up a conversation with gay porn star, Brandon (Justin Long, ""Walk Hard,"" ""Live Free Or Die Hard"").These scenes are easily some of the funniest in the picture, which is not the greatest endorsement for a comedy production.Later, after various utility companies shut down their water, heat and electricity on Thanksgiving eve, the two decide the only way to pay back their bills is to make a pornographic film (why didn't I think of that when I lost my last job? Stupid me).Recruiting a bunch of other neighborhood losers, including Delaney, Lex (Jason Mewes, the pot-headed ""Jay"" in several Kevin Smith films), Betsy (Jennifer Schwalback Smith), Barry (Ricky Mabe), Bubbles (former porn star Traci Lords), Roxanne (Anne Wade) and stripper Stacey (another porn starlet, Katie Morgan), Zack puts his plan into motion.They first plan to film ""Star Whores,"" with Zack as ""Hung Solo"" and Miri as ""Princess Laid Up,"" but their studio is destroyed by construction in the area. That's unfortunate, because this film parody really worked, unlike the remainder of the enterprise.Not to be defeated, however, Zack decides to use his employer's security camera and film the tale in the coffee shop. Here's where the fun (what there was of it) ended for me.It turned from rather raucous to raunchy, and while I'm not a prude by any sense of the word, I was quite put off by these scenes. Even John Holmes and Ron Jeremy would have been embarrassed in these roles.We get Lex and Stacey and Barry and Bubbles and then Zack and Miri all ""doing it"" for the camera. When the latter couple actually begin to feel something for each other, the sequence – while meant to be tender and loving – becomes really creepy.Smith wants us to feel for this mismatched couple, but their love is so tepid, so intermittent, with no chemistry whatsoever, I felt nothing when the curtain parted and the violins began playing.Those in the mood for a film like this should just rent a real porno and be done with it.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
79,rparham,Zack & Miri Make a Porno and also make you laugh,8,27 November 2008,"It is difficult to imagine a title that will more or less tell you almost everything major that happens in the movie you are about to see than Zack & Miri Make a Porno. The title pretty much sums up the whole film right there, in the broad strokes. But, as with most things, the meat is in the subtext. What the title doesn't tell you is that while making a porno, Zack & Miri, and their other accomplices, will make you laugh pretty hard. Zack & Miri Make a Porno may not be high art, but it is very funny movie, with a touch of heart to go along with it.Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have been best friends for as long as they can remember. They live together, but in a completely platonic relationship, drive to work together and both attend their school reunion together. Things are a bit rough for them these days, though: their rather meager jobs are not bringing in enough money to keep the rent paid and all the utilities running. So, after running into an old classmate whose lover is the star of porno films in California, they hit upon a brilliant scheme to make some money: make a porno film.In short order, they raise some capital from a co-worker (Craig Robinson), recruit a stripper, Stacey (Katie Morgan), Lester (Jason Mewes),a man who isn't afraid to expose himself, a cameraman (Jeff Anderson) and Zack and Miri plan to round out the cast themselves. However, in the process of getting down to business, Zack and Miri are realizing that their long-standing friendship may actually be something more, and can they manage to watch each other get it on with someone else after discovering that they may only want to be with each other.One thing is certain: if you are not able to listen to frank jokes featuring almost every vulgar word in the English language, not to mention a fair dose of nudity and simulated sex, you should be looking elsewhere for an evening at the movies. Zack & Miri Make a Porno pulls few punches in these categories. If this is not an issue for you, then Zack & Miri will provide a plethora of laughs. As scripted by Kevin Smith, Zack & Miri is one hilarious joke after another, most of which comes from Smith's always impressive ability to weave some terrific conversations full of wit between his various characters. Zack & Miri Make a Porno, like all of Smith's best films, is all about the dialogue, and it works wonderfully, as always.Seth Rogan is proving to be an actor who manages to give a performance that seems so completely unforced and natural. Zack, like many of Rogan's other roles, is a slice of life guy, and Rogen manages to make it seem like you are just watching a friend that you filmed around the house with a video camera. Elizabeth Banks is equally good in the role of Miri, and the two characters have a nice, natural chemistry, that evokes it's power when the two film their first sex scene for the porno, which Smith stages tastefully and scores with a great, unreleased song by Live. You know you care about what happens to these characters once this scene hits.The supporting cast is strong, especially Robinson as Zack's co-worker who is principally interested in financing this film so he can see some women naked after being married for so long (A scene between his character and his wife late in the film is a riot) and Jason Mewes, no longer under the influence of drugs, proves that he will do almost anything in a film and gets plenty of laughs.Zack & Miri Make a Porno is Kevin Smith's second turn at a film outside of his ""View Askewniverse"" series of films that he kicked off with Clerks, and it shows that Smith has ability to produce a funny film without exclusively relying on his old standby characters. In the process of doing so, he has crafted something that, if you can handle the racy nature of the material, will leave you in stitches.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
80,Mr_Censored,Smith Makes a Seth Rogen Vehicle,6,4 November 2008,"Perhaps the best way to describe this movie is to compare it to a sexual act described late in the movie: ""The Dutch Rudder"". Like ""The Dutch Rudder"", Kevin Smith's eighth film, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", is a cheap bit of fun, a nice way to kill some time, but nowhere near as good as it can and should be.Okay, so you haven't seen the movie and don't get the reference? That's fine. Allow me to elaborate. The story revolves around platonic friends/room-mates Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) who, after finding themselves in deep financial trouble, find inspiration at a high school reunion from a gay couple (a hilarious Justin Long and Brandon Routh) to venture into the adult film business to make ends meet. Together they gather a merry band of misfits -- including Craig Robinson, Traci Lords and View Askew alum Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson -- to create their own independent feature, with hopes that the eight hundred people they graduated with would pay to see it. However, as we can all see from miles away, when the time comes for Zack and Miri to do their scene together, it becomes apparent that they are more than just friends and things get complicated.First things first, there is a very simple problem with this movie that must be addressed. While the first half of the film is spot-on, hilarious and intriguing, once we reach the third act, the bottom gets soggy and the movie gives way. Once the ""scene"" between Zack and Miri takes place, it seems as though the movie doesn't know where to go. What this results in is a very homogenized, diluted and predictable plot that wraps up all too neatly and all too quickly. You'll have a blast with the first hour of the film, but the third act will leave you wanting more. It's by no means, the fault of the actors, who are all just as memorable, if not more, than the more famous title stars. Jason Mewes plays, well, Jason Mewes with Jeff Anderson finally shedding the skin of Randal the Clerk. Craig Robinson practically steals the show, and although Kevin Smith wrote this as a vehicle for Seth Rogen, it's Elizabeth Banks who has all the great lines and provides the heart of the film.Great cast aside, the plot just does not deliver. Apparently the script was rushed into production, and boy does it show. The movie pretty much ends just as it's getting good, and it ends in such a predictable, Hollywood fashion that it's hard to see Smith's touch. Truth be told, this is his weakest film, and I'm sure he'll acknowledge it later down the road. It's an interesting concept and the movie itself is well-made and looking good. Unfortunately, though, half-baked plots are not what people come to a Kevin Smith film for, and maybe that's a key reason why his name was subtly removed from most of the advertising. ""Zack and Miri"" is a movie that could have been directed by any stock director and that's a painful pill for the Smith faithful to follow. Even ""Jersey Girl,"" which was decidedly predictable, threw a few curve-balls our way before making it's point, but not here. We hit points A, B and C without making any detours. It's a shame, because the movie had a lot of potential to carry Kevin's career into the next decade, and to be his big money-maker. Remove Smith's name and presence, and you have a pretty average, but consistently funny and fun way to kill 90+ minutes. Not the worst comedy of the year, just the most disappointing.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

I'm talking about ""there can be only one"" scene, which was really funny, funnier than that was only the scene where Seth Rogen's character showed his school-photo.

I think you must be.It makes me very sad to say this, because I have generally been a big Kevin Smith fan, but I thought that ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" was a bit disappointing.Definitely not as good as ""Clerks"", ""Chasing Amy"" or ""Dogma"". In fact, scratch that. ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is not as good as any previous Kevin Smith film. The script is not as funny, the performances are not as assured and I did not warm to the characters as much. Kevin Smith by numbers, I'm afraid. ""Star Wars"" gags? Check. Sex talk? Check. Pop culture references? Check. Jay and Silent Bob? Er... OK. Fair enough. No Jay and Silent Bob (it would have been a better film if they had been in it), but I kept thinking to myself that maybe it is time for Kevin Smith to change the record.""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is not totally terrible. It is funny, and it does have some great moments, just not enough of them. Elizabeth Banks is sweet. Jason Mewes is funny. So is porn star Katie Morgan. Justin Long and Brandon Routh are really funny in their little cameo. Seth Rogan is... Seth Rogan. If you like him, you will like him in ""Zack and Miri Make A Porno"", if you don't like him, you won't. Traci Lords seems to have come to terms with her porn past.

83,mr_popcorn,Kevin Smith make Zack and Miri Make a Porno,8,18 December 2008,"Kevin Smith once again returns to the big screen with his latest offering ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"". With its suggestive title, one can already guess what the movie's about and the backbone basically is, for the whole duration of the movie, its about Zack (Rogen) and Miri (Banks) making a porno. But in their epic quest to make an adult-themed movie, in true Kevin Smith style, we are treated with chock full of crass, lowbrow and relentlessly immature dialogs and scenes. You hear the F word, the C word, the N word and every other word, some might get offended so take precautions. There's also boob shots, a woman blowing bubbles out her genitalia and a DP getting creamed with fecal matter. Everything you know and love about Smith's Askewniverse is here.However, I can't really say I fully enjoyed it to the maximum degree. The first half of the movie got off to a slow start. I don't know what happened there but the humor delivery needed a little bit more conviction both from Rogen and Banks. The movie picked up pace however when the cameras in the movie started rolling and the hilarity kicked into overdrive and it didn't stop until the end credits rolled. There is one thing that caught me off guard though, the love angle took me by surprise. I had no idea Smith wanted the movie to end with butterflies in our stomachs, that came out of nowhere and be that as it may, I think it worked pretty well. It may not be a directorial trait Smith is used to but that was a pretty good ending.Rogen and Banks are adorable together, they have great chemistry. Robinson from The Office stole the show and so is Jason Mewes (Silent Bob's other half) as Lester the Molester Cockenschtuff. All in all, I'd say Zack and Miri was just a blast and if you want to have a good time in the movies, this one is recommended.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

There is something very wrong with this movie, and I think a large part of it was casting Elizabeth Banks, who is above the material. The movie defiles her.A better title would be Zack and Miri Is a Porno Movie, because it is, and for Smith to be shocked about it and use the ""this day and age"" argument is wrong on his behalf. And there is also something very wrong about a middle-aged man including such a disgusting poo joke in his film.I didn't even want to comment on this film because I am not a fan of Smith's movies (even though I have seen them all and keep giving him a try, and I did like Clerks II).

86,moutonbear25,Kevin Smith Makes Another Mediocre Movie,6,30 October 2008,"Just in time for Halloween, one of the original independent filmmakers, Kevin Smith, gives us something truly frightening  Seth Rogen in a porno. No offense to Seth; I think he's cuddly and all but porn material, I think not. Or maybe I've just been out of the straight porn- watching world for so long that this is what porn has come to. That said, I doubt I'll be making a trip to my local video shop later to catch up on everything I've missed. What's that? I don't have to leave my home for this sort of fare anymore? It is all readily available online at the click of my mouse? And what? I'm supposed to be talking about Smith's latest mild chuckle fest, ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO? I thought we were discussing film worth leaving the house for. ZACK AND MIRI is not that film. Maybe you could download it, I guess.Zack and Miri may be making a porno but it is Kevin Smith making another lazy film that we should be focusing on. See, Smith is hoping that his sensational premise is enough to get you laughing ecstatically. He is primarily hoping for this because this way he can pass off his tired characters and simple jokes as something brand new, something no one has ever tackled in film before. Actually, that is giving him too much credit. The truth of the matter is that Kevin Smith is one of the most overrated filmmakers making movies today. He'd probably be the first to agree with me. This is because Smith doesn't really care about his work and you can feel it in every cliché his characters exist and every joke he sets up. How else can you explain married couple characters who yell at each other incessantly and complain even more so about how horrific and sexless marriage is? Or a party sequence where the camera doesn't move while we jump cut from one dancing fool to the next in full frame? And how can anyone these days justify using the word ""faggot"" as a meaningless insult, tossed around irresponsibly? Limited is the first word that comes to my mind.Getting back to Zack and Miri (Rogen and the luminous Elizabeth Banks), they are the most enjoyable and charismatic things about this film. Zack and Miri have been friends forever and never have they crossed that scary line and stepped into the realm of sex between friends. They live together, if you want to call their situation living. They're months behind on their rent; their electricity and water have been shut off; and neither one has a job that can actually get them out of this mess they've found themselves in. Naturally, they turn to the world of pornography for salvation. After all, they just found out that they have access to hundreds of contacts on their high school alumni mailing list that will no doubt jump at the chance to see this infamously platonic twosome finally get it on. I don't know about you but if I was so down on my luck that I needed to make porn to bail myself, I'm pretty positive that the high school acquaintances that teased and taunted me at my most fragile moments would not be the first people I would be peddling my wares to. In fact, they would be right up there with my mom. The irony of ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO is that Kevin Smith should feel right at home with the kinds of lower production values pornography calls for. In fact, I think I may have seen amateur porn that is subtler and more original than this film. It is not without its charm or its laughs but ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO is as forgettable as most of Smith's work and not nearly as intriguing as actual porn.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
87,screenwriter-14,Hoo-ray for Kevin Smith!,9,9 November 2008,"Zack and Miri is a fun ride and a very entertaining film from start to finish. What is so great about this film is the honesty of the dialog and the characters which depict couples in the USA who are struggling to not only pay their bills, but to find a true soul mate, in a time when there isn't much to motivate you. Kevin SMITH gave us CHASING AMY and now has brought an audience in ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORN FILM of the same rich development of character, story and amusing elements that just make you want to see more.The brilliance of taking a coffee bar, doesn't everyone remember the ""yuppyness"" of FRIENDS?, which is such a meeting place for people to connect, and taking that location to develop a porn film is such a twist on Starbucks. The supporting cast is terrific, down to earth, and such a contrast to pretty people in lush settings. With ZACK AND MIRI, Smith has written and directed a film which resonates with an audience today in America.

Writer-director Kevin Smith manages to break some patterns in his films, but his major problem is when he does it only apparently.The film starts very well about two childhood friends, Zack and Miri, which share the same house and their lives of unfortunate events. Broken and with no money to pay their bills that grows every day, they have a brilliant idea deciding to ​​produce a porn movie in which they will also act.Zack & Miri is quite funny, loose and never uncomfortable even with its rude and sarcastic dialogs because it is clever, unlike current comedy movies where backbiting and appealing heavy crude jokes are used relentlessly to take off some easy laughs. Elizabeth Banks is convincing and funny as a spontaneous and impulsive woman and Seth Rogen is sweet and charismatic even in a so dry and sarcastic character.The film, which could be simply a situation comedy or some twisted version of Boogie Nights, transforms into an ordinary romantic comedy where the two friends discover to be in love with each other, and the focus of the film, which was their solution to get out of misery producing an amateur porn movie, is left entirely aside as well as other supporting characters responsible for much of the movie effectiveness such as Traci Lords' Bubbles or Katie Morgan's Stacey that simply disappear from the movie as if they were not important at any time.The movie had a lot to be explored, but was underused and loses interest from the time that Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks give their first kiss.Stills being an interesting movie, but in the end gives you the feeling that something better could've happened than just turning into another ordinary romantic comedy.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Second, now I understand why there was so much controversy over the title and the poster. Zack and Miri Make A Porno is almost a full-blown porno movie in and of itself. And though there are some (almost) very graphic sexual visuals, lots of dialogue to match an authentic porn flick, and more F-words than you can count (someone did though), there are also moments in this movie that are touching (friendship, true love, how we're always there for who we really care about, even if it's just your best male buddy), and some absolutely hilarious scenes. The chemistry between Rogen and Banks was good and very believable. Even the premise of the movie is believable. I mean, how many of us, when we were young and barely making ends meet, have considered doing something not quite moral in order to survive? If you can get past the sex, nudity, and extreme profanity (all of it does not bother you), then check it out.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
90,pontram,Wonderful until it is going mainstream,7,1 August 2009,"I wanted to give this movie a 9, because it was very nice watching it. The actors are wonderful and likable, the story was interesting, and the dialogs are very enjoyable, if you like a variety and do not hesitate some f-words. It seemed to be a nearly perfect entertaining film, without any hypocritical attitude, which is (for me) a relatively new aspect in north American movies, especially those related with sex.The 9 I couldn't give to Zack and Miri, because in the last quarter is so mainstream and standard mediocre schematic, that I was disappointed. All the promises and the funny ruthlessness were not fulfilled, only for a happy end, which could be gained in a more intelligent way, like the great rest of the movie.So I felt there IS some hypocrisy, but brought across in a somewhere likable manner, like the producers are apologizing for their lack of courage. I know that filmmakers in USA aren't allowed to be so blatant, that I'm all over satisfied.However, this movie is a nice alternative way to tell a love story, I recommend it ever man to watch it together with the woman he loves secretly, or every woman together with the man she never thought to sleep with ;-)",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
91,joestank15,"Sweet, funny, and raunchy.",7,2 November 2008,"Zack and Miri Make a Porno - Two long-time best friends, Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are having trouble paying their bills and decide to solve their money troubles by making a porno with the help of their friends.The amount of trouble this film has had getting to the theaters is almost worth of a flick on it's own (more likely a DVD feature). It's hard to see why, apart from the title and the occasional presence of boobs (and Jason Mewes c***). Who knew the word ""porno"" was itself pornographic and taboo? I think the FCC has too much spare time.Aside from the mentioned, this is a sweet cute flick. Well that's not an entirely true statement. It's pretty profane, a given for a Kevin Smith film. It alternates between sweet, funny, and has brief moments of raunchiness. But mostly the film is on sweet mode. A surprisingly tender relationship between Zack and Miri is formed, and they learn that the porn industry is not as easy to conquer as once thought. Also, that sex, despite the easy way it is talked about by the characters and treated in the porn industry, means more than either cares to say.Kevin Smith actually does quite a bit with the camera this time around. Some changing of angles, cuts, and some nice fades. Nice, nice. I approve. But the centerpiece of his films is usually the script. It doesn't disappoint. That doesn't mean the film is uproarious. It's funny. It probably could have been funnier. Ironically, the film might appeal a little more to the ""Nick and Nora"" fans for its sweetness, once they grow up a bit. Given it's juvenile premise, the film is often quite mature.The supporting cast is wonderful. Jason Mewes gives the best performance you cold expect from him, which happens to be quite good, as Lester. It's the closing monologue that seals the deal, really. Brandon Routh and Justin Long switch names (Long plays a character named Brandon and Routh plays Bobby Long) as a pair of gay lovers, one of whom works in the gay porn industry. Craig Robinson (club doorman in Knocked Up and the hit-man in Pineapple Express) plays Zack's co-worker and the producer of the attempted porno. And Jeff Anderson is hilarious as the cameraman Deacon. Actual pornstars Katie Morgan and Traci Lords are also in the film, and both give surprisingly good performances. Why can't actual pornos have decent acting? It won't make a lot of money for its hard R rating and being banned in several states, and that's a shame. Why are we, as a nation, so PTSD about sex? I can watch a man get his fingers smashed in (and did, I saw Body of Lies) in raw graphic detail easier than I can see Katie Morgan's boobs for 20 seconds. And that's just wrong.Nice film overall. It sacrifices some laughs for genuine tenderness. If it were a little funnier I might score it higher. As such, I'll give it a B",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
92,Bravesfan17,Kevin Smith makes a comedy and a heartfelt story,10,22 May 2010,"When I found out a couple of years ago that writer-director Kevin Smith is making a comedy starring Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks, I had nothing but the highest expectations. Kevin Smith delivered, and my expectations were exceeded.Rogen and Banks play the title characters. Smith does great in showing us who Zack and Miri are and what they have done with their lives. Smith shows us that Zack and Miri are happy with each other but not with how their lives are going. Smith doesn't fool around in showing how they are financially as they have crappy jobs and their power gets shut off. That is when the title comes in. Zack gives good reason why they should make a porn movie in saying that they don't have families or dignity or options.That is when they become aspiring in hiring help for the movie. Zack enlists the help of a coworker as producer (played by Craig Robinson, a.k.a. Darryl from The Office) and Deacon as a camera operator and editor (frequent Kevin Smith actor Jeff Anderson). Zack and Miri work on the casting, and coming up with ideas for a porno movie.Zack and Miri and the crew run into ups and downs with the production of their porno movie. They have sets and costumes built only to find out that they bought their studio from a crooked owner and the place is destroyed.Smith knows how to make the situations hilarious and the dialogue witty without making it cheesy. Smith does a brilliant job with Rogen and Banks in making Zack and Miri fall in love while working on a love scene on the porno. Zack grows strong feelings for Miri, and later Miri makes those feelings mutual. This is easily the best performances from both Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as they show that they are great comedy actors, yet they show a wide range of emotions.

Seth Rogen once again plays an amazing lead in the film plus co-star Elizabeth Banks gives it her all. a brief appearance by Justin Long and Brandon Routh is probably the funniest part in the film.some of the scenes in this film are very controversial and disgusting so this film isn't for the faint hearted. basically the film title is exactly what the film is like. i wont go into details but you've been warned.the overview of this film is that its fantastic and very different to Kevin Smiths earlier work. also i found this isn't as good as the jay and silent bob films but still packs an enormous punch. fantastic....... 9/10........j.d Seaton",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
94,Simon_Says_Movies,They make a porno. They make you laugh.,7,28 November 2008,"Seldom (if ever) do I remember the mere contents of a films title causing such a fuss prior to release. The MPAA must have something very large protruding from their rectums, as to feel the need to initially slap Kevin Smith's latest effort with NC-17 rating. I don't know what the fuss is all about, but when Hostel: Part II can get an R, and Zack and Miri is in question, there is something rotten in Hollywood.The simplest explanation is that they felt the title 'Zack and Miri Make a Porno' publicly (such as on posters and commercials) divulged too much ""information"" regarding the raunchy content of the film. After watching Zack and Miri, I was quite shocked. Other then the frequent but not abnormally high occurrence of f-bombs, a quick male frontal scene and some shots of breasts, the movie is by Kevin Smith standards, tame. Even when comparing it to recent Judd Apatow flicks such as The 40-Year-Old-Virgin and Forgetting Sarah Marshall the structures are similar; they exhibit the same abundance of cussing, very similar subject matter and even use the '08, 'Full Monty' craze, yet all received R ratings. All that is left is the world Porno, which in the context of the film is not outrageous or unnecessary, and will not cripple the youth of North America. If I hear a case of a child's ears and eyes bleeding after exposure to the word Porno I will cheerfully retract my position.Kevin Smith is the original king of gross-out comedy, with his classic film Clerks, ranking as one of my favourite all time comedies. After chick flick-ish efforts such as Chasing Amy and Jersey Girl, Smith has fused these two styles together into a film that exhibits equal parts raunch and sweetness. Although similar to the Apatow formula, Zack and Miri is easily distinguishable as a Kevin Smith film, even with the casting of Apatow regulars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks. Disregarding all the hullabaloo, this film is simply funny. Plain and simple. Those who are at all interested should seek it out. If this is not your cup-o-porn, I mean tea, then don't go watch it and call it outrageous. (Unless you mean it in a positive light) Seth Rogen plays Zack, who shares a platonic relationship with his long time friend Miri (Banks). Finding themselves in dire financial straights, they try to enjoy the little things in life wherever possible. Following an eventful High School reunion, Zack gets the idea that all crosses through our mind at one time or another; make a porno with Miri to drag themselves out of the gutter. While initially reluctant, Miri comes around and they begin production. Zack secures finances from his coffee shop co-worker Delaney (Craig Robertson), and then begins casting, securing the likes of Lester (Smith regular Jason Mewes), a stripper named Lacey (Katie Morgan), a 'specialist' named Bubbles (Traci Lords) and an oddball named Barry (David Early). Zack also recruits his hockey team-mate Deacon (Jeff Anderson, who you will recognize from Clerks) to film.During the shoot however, something happens between Zack and Miri, and they begin to realize what they actually knew all along. The latter portions of Zack and Miri are mostly devoid of raunch, and devote time to the budding relationship of the two leads. Rogen and Banks exhibit excellent chemistry and the solid scripting by Smith makes the characters seem like real people. The two portions while strong on their own do not mesh seamlessly, but works well enough for me to still put forth a strong recommendation. This film is worth seeing for the scene stealing work by Justin Long alone, as the man who sets off Zack's porno-inspired ambitions, as well as for the funniest 'poo' joke since, well, this decade at least. Zack and Miri will make good on making a porno, but they will make something else as well. They will make you laugh.7.5 / 10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

96,frankenbenz,"Kevin Smith Makes a Movie...well, not quite.",6,6 December 2008,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/Kevin Smith thinks he's funny much in the same way Quentin Tarantino thinks he's cool. Problem is, they're not and their continued attempts to prove otherwise have become incredibly grating. While Tarantino once made good films heavily inspired by great films, Smith has always been a true auteur: singular and influenced by no one but himself. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is conclusive proof Smith's unique style will never change, it will never mature and it will always suck. There's nothing wrong with that if you're a frat boy and you love puerile, telegraphed jokes, but let's be real...Smith's sh** stopped being funny about five minutes after Clerks.The words in Smith's screenplays rain down like an epic hail storm, with so much crammed into the mouths of his actors, audiences have little ability to breathe, let alone watch a movie. But the fact is, Smith doesn't make movies, he writes dialogue and if there is a less visual director working, you would have to go all the way back to the pre-movie days of radio to find him. Worst of all, Smith's dialogue is rarely funny or smart, it's merely a rambling tirade of profane, pop-culture inanity, singular in its authorial voice. Good writing doesn't scream out loud who wrote it, just like good film-making shouldn't. Unfortunately for the very few of you who plunked down money to see this movie, Kevin Smith is neither a good writer nor is he a good director, he's just another narcissist in love with his own patented brand of verbal diarrhea.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

It wasn't such a take off like many other movies it had many of it's own story lines and funny jokes. Some scenes were takes off other movies but for the most part had its own stuff for a lot of the movie. I would go see this movie again just because some of the things in this movie were outrageously funny and never seen before in a any other movies. The movie was definitely not eligible to kids under the age of 16 I would say. It had many dirty scene in it and was definitely a hard R rating. The acting was good for the most part. The characters were a ll funny and enjoyable. The movie had a little bit of heart but all they way at the end of the movie. Their weren't many different film locations in the movie it was just all pretty much like a few different places. The movie wasn't confusing at all it was all just mainstream. The story wasn't just all about making a porno it had a lot more to it than just that. A little bit of a love story as well.

99,Monotreme02,"Hilarious but touching, vulgar but poignant",7,7 December 2008,"Kevin Smith has, for a long time, been at the center of a pretty much ongoing controversy regarding his quality as a director. Many movie-lovers contend that Smith is a very gifted writer-director, with a unique vision composed of his trademark combination of geek-culture-obsessed characters on the one hand, and in-your-face vulgarity on the other. Many others contend that Smith is talent-less and overrated. Until now, I have placed myself pretty much in between these two extremes: On the one hand, I definitely think that Smith is talented, and his movies are always, if nothing else, hilarious, vulgar but sweet at the same time. That said, I have always felt that Smith has only truly made an actual movie, well-directed and showing genuine directorial technique, twice before in his career: Chasing Amy and Dogma. But after seeing it, I simply can't see how anyone could watch Zack and Miri Make a Porno and still say that Smith has no talent.First of all, the film is absolutely hilarious. The humour is also of a very wide variety, ranging from subtleties in the stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks' quirky performances, to the colourful nature of the supporting cast; from pop-culture references to what may be the most skillful application of curse words since the Coen Brothers; from juvenile slapstick and sight gags to some pretty vulgar visualizations. What all these elements have in common is that they all appear in Smith's script, which really is quite adeptly written, providing a proficient combination of humour and heart. And it is in this aspect that the film, and Smith in particular, really excels.Smith, usually focusing on exclusively geek-culture-oriented characters, has broadened the scope and provided us with two irresistibly likable characters with whom many of us can identify: unpopular, unlucky Average Joes who are far wittier and funnier than the people around them but also fail to find an outlet for their ambition and creativity and instead find themselves bitter, cynical and broke. While the film becomes (perhaps intentionally, as a parody) too obvious with its whole bringing a bunch of misfits together message, it totally hits the nail on the head when it comes to the relations between Zack and Miri. Smith approaches it with just the right amount of kitsch and just the right amount of genuine emotion and ends up making it pretty much the single most enjoyable and downright wonderful aspect of a very enjoyable movie. Detractors, say what you want about Smith's directorial talents, but Zack and Miri's sex scene is just plain good film-making; perfect selection of angles, perfect use of music and spot-on comic timing and editing. And speaking of music, it's also worth mentioning that the film's soundtrack was absolutely outstanding.The comedy and the drama are both sold by the stellar cast. Supporting characters are fittingly and perfectly colourful, the standout of course being Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith's go-to guy in vain of the Scorsese-De Niro, Burton-Depp dynamic. But the main focus is on the two stars, and they definitely live up to the challenge. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks, both members of the Judd Apatow clan, find themselves in this movie reciting Kevin Smith's dialogue, and the end result is a kind of majestic combination of both styles of humour. Both actors are irresistibly likable and identifiable, and they portray the characters absolutely spot-on, with just the right amount of desperation, determination and sweet, innocent optimism. My hat is off to the entire cast, but the scene-stealing minor role award goes to none other than Justin Long, whose scene-and-a-half appearance was absolutely the funniest, most laugh-out-loud aspect of a very funny movie.A major departure from Smith's previous body of work in both content and style, Zack and Miri also stands as his best-directed film and also one of if not his best film to date. Hilarious but touching, vulgar but poignant, Smith provides us with two irresistibly likable characters and puts them through just the right amount of off-the-wall comedy, cheesy kitsch and genuine, whole-heartedly sweet romantics to affect even the most jaded Smith critic. Showcasing genuinely skillful selection of angles and camera positions, with Zack and Miri Smith has come full-circle as a director and, I think, proved his true worth and talent as a filmmaker. And while much of the film may seem like a departure from Smith's previous trademark style, only he would include, as a major plot point in his film, a Star Wars-parody porno called ""Star Whores"".",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

The basic premise is two lifelong friends now roommates Zack and Miri after encountering a series of financial setback decide to make an adult movie to pay their bills. The casting of Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks was very good as both have the needed presence for the material as both can play the everyday people that they are representing. Things going very swimmingly with a lot of funny scenes and dialogue but problems arise when both realize that the love one another and a little misunderstanding causes some friction but I do not want to divulge more as one has to see this movie. May I also say that despite the raunchiness the story has a soft and sweet side and is one to enjoy but what is disturbing is the rating of this movie at 18 A this bothers me as I am not disputing the fact that some of the scenes are not meant for minors but when one sees the violence in 14A or R movies it seems so hypocritical to give this movie its' rating. Also the controversy about the movie poster is absolutely ridiculous.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
102,madbandit20002000,Cinematic Coitus By The Broke (or Kevin Smith Has Done It Again!).,10,3 November 2008,"With the economy in the toilet (thanks a lot, President Spanky McDumbass!!!), Americans have struggled to keep afloat. Solutions have included part-time work, semen donations and adult films.What? You don't believe people would actually sexually exploit themselves to make easy, quick cash? For proof, either visit a local adult video store (if you have access to one); go on the Internet (duh!!!) or see the obviously titled ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", the eighth cine opus by gonzo humor madman, Kevin Smith.Platonic buds since the first grade and fellow workers at the ""Bean-N-Gone"", a Starbucks-esquire coffee shop in snow-covered Monroeville, Pennsylvania, Zack Brown (Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up"" and ""Pineapple Express"") and Miri Linky (Elizabeth Banks of ""W"", ""Role Models"" and ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"") are threatened with eviction from their crappy abode since Zack's financially careless (Ice skates?!).Despite their underdog standing, the duo head to their 10th high school reunion, so Miri could screw (physically and mentally) football legend Bobby Long (a subtlety impressive Brandon Routh of ""Superman Returns""). Too bad he's already taken by the deep-voiced Brandon (Justin Long of Mac promos and ""Live Free or Die Hard""); both are lovers, in real life and homosexual porn films.That inspires Zack as salvation out of the financial hole he and Miri are in. Miri's not sure about it, but since her dressing and undressing moments were electronically caught by two kids and posted on the Internet, retaining dignity is a goal too far gone. (""Granny Panties?"". HA HA!!!) After getting cash, a sound stage and societal misfits, our (anti) heroes are ready to shoot ""Star Whores"", a carnal parody of George Lucas's monolithic space opera, but the studio gets torn down, due to the shifty dealings of its owner (horror makeup artist Tom Savini). Plan B: do an Ed Wood and film at the Bean-N-Gone ""Swallow My Cockaccino"" (Oh, murder!!!). However, Zack and Miri's deep feelings for each other, like coffee, brew up, complicating things more than a bad audio track.True romance in a real-life adult film may damn it, but Mr. Smith, the Sam Peckinpah of comedy, refuses it to let that happen. If anyone says he should cinematically ""grown up"", they're either prudish, jealous, stupid, certifiable, conformistic or all the above; I vote for answer F. Like in his previous works, Mr. Smith slyly takes the elements of friendship, romance, individualism, social honesty and quick-witted profane humor and forms them into a giant Tinkertoy structure that can't be destroyed, let alone unseen.His actors are more than reliable. The teddy bear Rogen (a fan of Smith's since seeing his first work, ""Clerks"" when he was twelve) knows where the bodies are buried because he's been in frat-house humor ventures crafted by Judd Apatow, who definitely owes Mr. Smith a lot. Sweet and cute as a button, Ms. Banks is a perfect foil to Mr. Rogen, willing to swim in the cesspool, unlike Kate Heigl, Rogen's co-star in ""Knocked Up"". Craig Robinson (also of ""Express"" and ""The Office, US version"") is a righteous hoot as co-worker/producer Delaney, who's racially sensitive in unnecessary situations.Ex-porn starlet Traci Lords represents dark carnality as Bubbles, a stripper whose talent involves her vaginal cavity and bubble liquid (DON'T ASK! JUST WATCH!!!), while the lighter side of sex is handled by current player Katie Morgan, who delightfully echoes cartoon characters Betty Boop and Harley Quinn (Smith's daughter's namesake) as Stacey, a squeaky-voiced strip club waitress. She should work in a film penned by stripper-cum Oscar-winning scribe Diablo Cody (""Juno"", ""Jennifer's Body""). As aspiring cine-submissive Barry, Ricky Mabe's an odd but efficient tadpole.The only Smith stock company players utilized here are my favorite ones: Jeff Anderson as Deacon, the porn film's cameraman who's a roguish sociopath goalie on an amateur hockey team Zack's on, and the madcap Jason Mewes (a childhood chum of Mr. Smith's) as Lester, a shameless nudist who's ready for action. That's a stretch!!!! Mr. Smith's wife, Jennifer Schwalbach, makes her fourth acting advent as an old, snobby classmate of the lead duo, and it's suitable.Long and Routh are astonishingly expert as the gay porn couple, camping it up and slightly flipping the bird to ""Superman Returns"" producer Jon Peters, who naively wanted Mr. Smith, while working on a draft of the now-produced film, to include a giant spider for the Man of Steel to fight in the story. Like that's a box-office benefit There's also Tyler Labine (""Reaper"", which Mr. Smith directed the pilot episode) as a drunk Steelers fan who's a funny, personified coitus interruptus during a shooting scene. A forgivable flaw is Tisha Campbell-Martin's one-note role as Delaney's stereotypically shrewd wife.Though not the first film to tackle the subject of losers making porn films, ""Zack and Miri"" is the most ambitious, competently made and theatrically-released (""National Lampoon's Barely Legal"" and ""The Amateurs"" were released on DVD domestically). People will bemoan the film, the title and subject (the MPAA initially gave the film a NC-17 rating, but Mr. Smith rightfully urged for and received a R), but the way the country's today, complaining about a raunchy comedy is futile. They might as well count how many ants go to and leave an ant hill everyday. Kevin Smith has done it again, and God bless him for it.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

105,clivy,"Great premise, but Zack and Miri make bowdlerized porn and romance",5,9 March 2009,"The title of ""Zack and Miri make a Porno"" promises fun and bawdiness, and it delivers: in the first half. The first hour features great dialogue, a fantastic sequence with Justin Long (I wish my high school reunion was like that!), and magnificent acting from Craig Robinson and Traci Lords. The audition scenes are priceless. Unfortunately once Zack and Miri actually get down to it the comedy and sass come to a halt. We wondered if the Moral Majority stopped production and made Kevin Smith for the conclusion of the movie shoot their idea of what a porno should be like: a man and a woman making lurrrrrrvvee and discovering their deep feelings for each other (with no showing of Miri's breasts, and with no risk of pregnancy, apparently. Perhaps Miri is on the Pill). Feelings so deep neither one can have sex with anyone else. All of the sudden the plot becomes bogged down with relationship angst and mores straight out of high school. In a way it's appropriate for Zack and Miri since emotionally they are still in high school, but they see that Brandon and Bobby have a happy relationship, even if Brandon makes gay porn. The ad for Zack and Miri's porn service celebrates the power of porn - to enhance a relationship. Furthermore, the clip is stuck in the middle of the credits, and seems an afterthought. Or the director trying to sneak in some of his original ideas for the ending before the audience leaves.""Zack and Miri"" could have followed several different directions. It could have shown the cafe owner discovering what his employees were doing after hours on his premises and trying to become involved; it could have shown Zack and Miri trying to distribute their production to a public bigger than the graduates who went to their school. It could have become more of a farce and a satire taking aim at consumerism, corporations, and the porn industry (what if Zack and Miri's amateur production became a bigger seller than mainstream porn titles?) What a shame that the movie didn't develop its celebration of ordinary people finding enpowerment and inspiration in making their own film, shooting themselves acting out fantasies. That would have been a more powerful movie as well as a funnier one, and a far far sexier one.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Too bad, if they had made Star Whores, and offered it as a separate movie on the second DVD, this might have propelled this hit to eternal cult status, but alas, we only get a glimpse of the costumes and instead they have to make do by filming in the local Char-bucks imitation they work at.Along the way, the predictable sexual tension erupts between these lifelong friends only who have secretly lusted after each other for years.Look for real life porn star Katie Morgan taking the acting BOOTs to Traci Lords, who really should never have left porn she is such a bad actress.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
107,mrrockey,Funny and Witty with the Right Amount of Heart,7,11 April 2014,"I'm gonna get this right out of the way, I have never seen a Seth Rogen comedy nor a Kevin Smith film prior to this. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is my big introduction to both Seth Rogen's jerkoff comedy films, and director Kevin Smith's work. Before, I only knew Rogen based on films like The Green Hornet and Kung Fu Panda and I've never seen a Kevin Smith film before. But after checking this out, I'm glad to say that I'm interested in checking out MORE of their work.The plot of Zack and Miri Make a Porno follows two roommates in Monroeville, Pennsylvania named Zack Brown and Miri Linky. Despite both being employed, they haven't paid their utility bills in months. After going to their high-school reunion, where Zack finds out one of his former classmates is now a porn star, Zack decides to do it as well with Miri and a few friends'help.The thing that surprised me most about Zack and Miri Make a Porno is how unapologetic it is with its content. At first, I thought this was gonna be, at BEST, a PG-13 film that only makes tame references to sex and not show much but instead, the film goes all-out with excessive profanity, graphic sex depictions, and lots of nudity. There's many scenes in the film where your jaw will just DROP from what you saw on screen and depending on your sense of humor, you will either chuckle your balls off, or you'll just be incredibly offended and grossed-out. It's certainly not a film for everyone. However, since I don't mind dirty humor every once in a while, I actually found the film quite funny. Even though the language is very profane, there's a wit and charm to the way the characters deliver them. They don't just say ""Fwck!"" or $hit!"" again and again, they get creative with them and make up something witty and clever instead. Some of the funniest moments for me was when they come up with porn parody titles, which include Dawn of the Dick, Star Whores, and Fwckback Mountain. The sex scenes, while graphic, have a lot of good physical comedy to them and there's even one that works as a dramatic, intimate scene that also feels realistic. And while the nudity's not entirely necessary, it makes the porn in the feel all the more authentic.While Zack and Miri is not a DEEP film, it does have heart and characters you can latch on to. Seth Rogen plays Zack Brown as a bit of a juvenile moron but he clearly has a heart and you can buy his love for Miri at the end. Zack could've been one of those characters who started out funny, but who's schtick just got old midway through and it probably would have if he was the sole protagonist but since has someone to bounce it off with, he becomes lot more likable. Elizabeth Banks portrays Miri as the straight man(or woman in this case) of the duo and she's likable in her own right. Banks feels very normal and genuine on screen here and it makes you buy her being friends with someone like Seth Rogen when she looks like a model. But she also has funny moments of her own such as when she tries to seduce her former classmate Bobby, who turns out to be a gay porn star. The love story between these two work because the way they're written make them don't feel like traditional rom com characters. They actually sound more like bros hanging out instead because of the way they talk to one another and the fact that they actually TALK about whether one of them wants to have sex with the other and having it take place like a normal conversation is actually pretty refreshing. I also love how there's no clichéd ""misunderstanding"" situation when Zack mistakens her of sleeping with Brandon. Any other movie would have had this as a huge problem in the story but here, it's done and over with very quickly and they play it up more for comedy. They're relationship is what ultimately carries the film and because of the solid performances the actors give and the refreshing writing, it works.The rest of the cast is pretty good as well. There's not a WHOLE lot to say about them, as they're mostly just there for comedy but Craig Robinson, Jason Mewes, Traci Lords, Katie Morgan, Ricky Mabe, and Justin Long were ALL hilarious, especially Justin Long as gay porn star Brandon. His deep voice with his straight face when reading out porn titles is just comedy gold.But with that being said, there are some minor problems I have with this film. I thought the ending was a little rushed and I would've actually liked to SEE what the characters did afterwards as opposed to just title cards on screen TELLING us what happened. And I do think Zack and Miri's relationship was more interesting before they started filming porn and getting really awkward over each other. I liked how subversive their relationship was before so it was kind of a disappointment that the film had to go through a lot of the clichés we see in this type of film later on. But overall, this is a funny, witty film that may not be for everyone, but for Seth Rogen/Kevin Smith fan, it's a must-see. 7/10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
108,longcooljolie,Zack and Miri make us laugh and almost cry,8,13 September 2019,"For years I was aware of this title but sort of shrugged it off as just another gross-out comedy or a typical modern romantic comedy with just maybe a grin or two throughout the whole thing.It was on Netflix and I finally discovered it while looking for a good comedy after a tough day at work. Not only was it much better than I expected, and not only did it make me laugh uncontrollably for a couple of scenes, but I've gone on to revisit the movie numerous times. My favorite thrift store near where I used to live had the two-disc DVD with a whole side of extras, so I bought that as well.How is it good? Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks elevate the story and the material for one thing. Seth as ""Zack"" in this movie plays a loveable lug, while Miri is played by Elizabeth Banks who has sort of become kind of an everywoman with roles as diverse as this, Laura Bush in ""W,"" and Effie Trinket in the ""Hunger Games"" movies. Would some of the scenes been as hilarious with a pair of lesser actors portraying the leads? Methinks not.Kevin Smith made the movie and he included a few of his go-to's from some of his other movies such as Jason ""Jay"" Mewes and Jeff Anderson from the ""Clerks"" movies. Also, in a clever move he included actual porn stars Katie Morgan and Traci Lords to round out the cast of characters who help Zack and Miri make their porno.There is also a hilarious turn by Justin Long, who plays Brandon St. Randy a gay porn actor who serves as an interesting catalyst for the story. The other Brandon, Brandon ""Superman"" Routh makes a nice showing, too for a couple of scenes that made me wish ""Superman Returns"" had been more successful so that it would have generated sequels for him and other appearances in other high-profile movies.In case anyone reads this review who hasn't seen it yet, there will be details left out so you can fully enjoy the delightully comical scenes that lead up to Zack and Miri's decision to resort to making porno and some of the hilarities that ensue of the making of the porno itself. Yet, it's not all pushing-the-NC17-envelope madness. There is a very satisfying conclusion that shows that Kevin Smith can touch us in the heart as well.The only thing I kept thinking at the beginning was the presence of what looked like sub-zero cold and snow in Pittsburgh on what is supposed to be the day before Thanksgiving. Does that ever happen there? It's just a minor nitpick, but if you're not too prudish or squeamish ""Zack and Miri"" is an extremely fun movie to watch and watch again.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

There is a particular scene involving a Steelers fan and I was crying from laughing so hard, and also made me think the sex in it could have actually been happening. I thought this movie was totally underrated and wish that people would lighten up and love it the way I loved it.

111,carljessieson,A Delightful Surprise,6,6 September 2010,"Way too much dirty nasty references to sex for me, way too much boobage The only thing I laughed at was the comedy not involving sex of any kind, which is unfortunate considering the entire movie is about sex. That's my own problem, I guess. Why did I even watch this? I found that the best thing about the movie was not the comedy, but the interaction between Zack and Miri. The whole thing involving them was really adorable to me, very well-established. They're good pals. The film is about these two friends who live together and can't pay the bills, so they decide to make a porn to make some quick cash. I love them. Their whole thing was tops. The sex humor just did not appeal to me at all. If you like vulgar jokes then you will absolutely love this film. If I could take this movie and edit it, I would take out the nasty stuff and then only have the stuff between Zack and Miribut then there really wouldn't be a movie, so I actually wouldn't do that.So I'll rate it not according to my own preferences, but according to what I believe are the important ingredients to a comedy. There was an excellent emotional aspect of the film that is rare in most comedies, or forced and false-feeling. I'm giving it a 6/10 because it had good jokes occasionally and great characters, but it had too much nastiness and too many jokes that didn't make me laugh audibly. I feel like this is one of those movies that you'll really love if you're not thinking and if you have a basic, immature sense of humor. I hope I don't offend anyone by that. : ( Pretty much the only things I liked were Zack and Miri's thing (earning 4/10) plus Zack's co-worker from the coffee shop (earning 2/10).Interesting to watch, yes; but would I buy it? No. If a friend owned it or rented it and suggested we watch it, I would check to see if they had any better options first, but if they didn't have any, I would watch it with them. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd watch it again only to see Zack and Miri.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

The acting from Jeff Anderson - who plays the cameraman - is noticeably dreadful even though he plays a small part. The rest of the characters are annoying and add very little to the film. The plot sort of drags on too. The group makes a Star Wars-themed porno only to have the entire footage, set and costumes destroyed. Down, but not out, Zak has the genius idea of using the coffee shop in which he works as the location for a new dirty flick that will feature the same cast, who have now all become close friends (how cute). Filming resumes and Zak and Miri have a love scene that apparently sets off long-subdued sparks between the two roommates.

No it doesn't, it continues with the romance, like nothing just happened, and I appreciate the brave approach which finally breaks in mainstream.Also I was quite surprised by the amount of laughs Elizabeth Banks brings in, I wasn't surprised from the male cast which was expectable, but She is one of the few actresses who are able to do that and compete with the guys.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
114,solidgameboy12-1,Zack and Miri Make a Porno - And It is Great.,9,29 November 2008,"For years, Kevin Smith has made movies since the early 90's about real people: He started with Clerks., a movie that has made talking about smut and Star Wars a pastime besides at comic conventions. Smith has had success with Jay and Silent Bob for years with Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks 2. As many fans of Smith know, He also did the change of pace movie title of ""Jersey Girl"", which I gave a very good review of for being like Smith and having a lot of heart while being grown up.As big as a fan as I am, Clerks II didn't do it for me; It ruined for me what I loved about Smith's previous work, that as crude as some of his content could be, his heart was in the right place. As I find myself still glued to Kevin Smith's work, and will watch him until he dies, or until I do, I could only guess what would come into Kevin's mind next, and lo and behold, We have Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks in Zack and Miri Make a Porno.The movie premise is simple. Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) have been friends since the 1st grade, and have been living together for a couple years, which has been fine, until they find themselves in a dilemma: The bills need to be paid, and they are without finances. In a cold town during November, what are a boy and girl to do? Zack decides that the two should make a porn.Now here is where you probably go away and never look back at this movie ever, but it's actually a great movie. The premise is a pretty mature one, but it doesn't have to be mature to make a movie like this. This movie could have had no plot, make a bunch of sex jokes and never go anywhere, but instead, this movie makes a real great relationship with two people. Zack and Miri have been friends for years, and have endured a lot together, but is their friendship worth it to have sexual relations for profit? What is great about Kevin Smith is he makes characters with great dialog and creative backgrounds, all the while making immature content, while making his characters lovable. That is something that is hard to do, what with straight to video sex comedies everywhere and no nothing movies designed to show a bunch of bad actors in a substandard plot, but this movie makes you care for everybody, and that is what makes this movie great.When you get into the last 50 minutes or so (The movie is an hour and a half) you see where the movie makes an adult like Smith seem like he's not just another sex comedy writer, but a brilliant comedic writer. I'll tell you what; I wish Zack and Miri were real, just so I could go find them and hang out with them, not Banks and Rogen, but the two characters themselves. You really love them, and that's what makes this movie work.And to all the people who blast the title and/or content: It's not going to hurt to loosen up and see this movie. It's a romance movie of an entirely different kind, put it that way. See this movie first, then judge, but don't do what I could have done.Kevin Smith has made a movie I will definitely buy on DVD. I give Zack and Miri Make a Porno a 9 out of 10.See this movie, you will not be disappointed.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
115,mjjusa-1,Zak and Miri Make Something Special,7,3 November 2008,"I just saw Zak and Miri Make a Porno. As with all Kevin Smith movies there is gold amid the dross of continuous infantile, jerk off humor. In this case: ten f**ks a minute dialog, whatever 'taste' barriers left in main stream movies ripped asunder by his extremely funny New Jersey sensibility of writing about all those things that guys think, or imagine, or fantasize about sex and women. Now, though, he gets to put it all on the big screen and populate his Jersey fantasies with beautiful actresses. The nameless unnoticed clerk who lived the life that gave rise to the screenplay, directing the kind of women he only saw in movies in his movies.But, as in every movie that he directed and I have seen, somehow making it achingly real and sometimes moving. He has a real feel for the universal in all guys. Especially for all the guys who have felt like losers, in dead end jobs, with dreams of a different life. Which, in fact, is all of us. John Lennon, from the NJ part of England, once replied to a question from a reporter thusly: ""Hey, I only wrote about my life, and it turned out to be everyones life."" So too, of Kevin Smith.In Zak and Miri, it's all there, the good and the bad, and the gross and grosser. But, then, in one wondrous scene, he does something different, something surprising. He writes and directs this scene: one that causes to you feel that sense of love that you don't get to feel until you actually make love to someone you actually love. That fitting of the piece, that creation of peace, that look that you see when she looks at you, and you know. That first instance in your life where the act becomes making love. You never forget that moment. And, Kevin Smith didn't either.What a f**king movie. Tenderness amid the coarse, capturing the most intimate thing that any of us could ever feel.

117,bloodymonday,The funniest Kevin's film to date (but not necessary the best one),7,7 December 2008,"So I'm gonna come right out and say it, I'm Kevin Smith's devotee. He's like a god of Geekniverse (wait, that's mean I'm..never mind). For what it's worth, he's like my own personal ""sensei"" who helps me explore world of movies. I've first watched Chasing Amy exactly 10 years ago, which is the third movie under his belt (first two are his break-out, Clerks, and a big mess yet hysterical flick, Mallrats).Well, needless to say, that movie changed my perspective in life forever. It is the most simplistic yet complicate love story ever. It's a kind of movie that you know exactly what it should be, but then it'll go the opposite way every time. And it achieved by having only characters talk to each other all the time. Hate to say it, but I think he is Woody Allen of MY generation.I can keep talking about his other flicks all day long, but this is a review of his latest film, so I'm gonna go back on that. I think you guys will know that the pitch of this film just read the title. Yes, it's about a slacker named Zack and his platonic friend, Miri, decide to make a porno together. And it's going to be vulgar, completely down N' dirty. You guys might love what Judd Apatow does nowadays, with his usual shtick to bombard us with F-words. Well, this is the motherload of vulgarity; the one that will make your religion-obsessed neighbor freak out.This maybe close to Kevin Smith's funniest movie. A reunion scene in the beginning might be one of most memorable scene in this flick, with hysterical cameos by Justin Long and Brandon Routh as Gay couple in porn industry?!?! Dialogs came fast and furious (as usual), which you have to listen carefully to find out that they're so hysterical. They're jokes that sounded like coming from adolescence's mind, but I think this kind of approach is so rare these days, which the genre nowadays dominated by idiotic slapstick and mundane situation comedy.It seemed Kevin Smith want to reach out to broader audience by borrowing Seth Rogen from Apatow's troop, which I think it improved this flick immensely. Because almost of his flicks, our protagonist often fell into the category of ""straight man"". It's nothing wrong about that at all, since he surrounded by such a memorable supporting characters. But imagine if he has ideal lead, what would it be? I think Seth filled that blank perfectly. He fully capable to deliver those cracked up dialogs and still able to make this film on his own with his usual earnest and likable persona.What about our own Miri? I'm kind of disappointed to find out that Rosario Dawson turned down this role (and did Eagle Eye?!). But right now, I can't think of anybody will play this role better than Elizabeth Banks. She's beautiful woman and did not afraid to act silly occasionally. Her comic timing is surprisingly good (watch her in reunion scene, and you'll know what I mean). And when the film require her to be more dramatic, she's just nails it like a piece of cake. In fact, she did it even better! Watching Zack and Miri Make a Porno is pure entertainment, but in dramatic part, it's still no match with Chasing Amy (which is amusing AND touching). Maybe the movie just didn't give enough time for its two leads to go through various phases of relationship. We're fully aware what's going on in their mind, but it's just damn shame that we didn't have a chance to see them bare all emotion on the plate (only a scene in preparation room toward in end that I found myself stunned with a result). In my opinion, Kevin might want to keep his movie energetic, so when the movie started to slow things down, he decided to inject a new joke immediately.Beside Zack and Miri, the rest of the crew consisted of former porn star, Traci Lord (nothing to see here, guys), up-and-coming porn star, Katie Morgan who was surprisingly decent in first non-porn role, Apatow's alumni (Craig Robinson), cameraman (played by Jeff ""Randal"" Anderson) who receive the most disgusting (and hilarious....for certain kind of people) thing ever put on the history of mainstream cinema and...Lester (played Jason ""Jay"" Mewes) who went ""Full Monty"" for your own viewing pleasure (he even bend over in front of the camera...urg!!)As I've said in fifth paragraph, supporting characters are essential to Kevin Smith's films. But they're also poorly used in this film. The great character like Banky in Chasing Amy or Jay & Silent Bob in almost every Kevin's films is nowhere to be found. In my opinion, even though they're quite funny in their own right, but I really don't feel attached like most of characters in Kevin's previous flicks. It didn't make me want to see them more in the future like Chasing Amy or Clerks I & II.Many people complain why he keeps making the same film over and over and over again. He needs to grow up. He needs to change. He needs to blah blah... I think anyone who said that might think Jersey Girl is his best flick (haha+ of course I'm kidding).Well, I don't really have an explanation for it. But I think making diverse kind of films doesn't count as grown up (they can be all suck if that filmmaker is no talent hack). Kevin Smith is indeed talented filmmaker and he's in the zone that he feels belong to. If he wants to keep on making these kinds of films, you can count me in any time. But if he wants to reach out for something different, I'll be delight to see them all as well.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Don't let the title fool you very good movie. Elizabeth Banks and Seth Rogen play 2 cash strapped roommates who are in desperate financial trouble so they decide to make a porno. Once the cameras start rolling long repressed feelings begin to surface and things will no longer be the same. Also starring real life porn stars Traci Lords and Katie Morgan this is one great comedy that will have you laughing from start to finish. From the director of Clerks and Dogma Kevin Smith has made another dirty comedy classic!",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
119,misterembryo,View Askew and Apatow Peeps Make an Awesome Movie.,8,2 November 2008,"Thanks to the aptly named title, brilliantly appointed by Kevin Smith (writer, director, and creator of the View Askew Universe), you go into the film with a certain mindset, a dirty one to be exact. This follows the explicit what-you-see-is-what-you-get nature of every pornographic film title, a fact that offers hilarious moments as Zack and Miri are eventually faced with the difficult task of creating a movie title that says it all.Yes, Zack and Miri Make a Porno is exactly that, Zack and Miri making a porno. And believe you me, there is plenty of potty mouth to go around. But as dirty as the movie is, you will be surprised and delighted to find that this is a movie with a lot of heart, and as with all Kevin Smith pieces, a great deal of brain (no pun intended).Zack and Miri have been BFF's since the first grade, which has rendered their relationship strictly platonic. They have never really amounted to much since graduating high school ten years ago, but know that deep down inside they are really much better than the others, or at least tell themselves that.At the high school reunion, Zack and Miri have to endure the inevitable: the mindless chitchat and feigned nostalgia. The only reason Zack goes is to laugh at people, while Miri goes to show her high school crush what a hottie she's become. To Zack the night is a success, thanks to a hilarious cameo by Justin Long, while Miri's night doesn't quite go as planned. What they come away with is the realization that they really need to do something with their lives, if only to save them from their economic crisis, a story that is not uncommon in America these days. You guessed it. They make a porno.As silly as it sounds, there is something truly heartfelt, albeit raunchy, about watching Zack and Miri and the rest of their crew make their porn movie. It's kind of like watching Mark Borchardt make his low budget horror flick in the hilarious documentary American Movie, only the porn Zack and Miri and company make is quite possibly the worst porn ever made (okay, okay that may be an exaggeration but you get my point).All around is a job well done by the cast and cameos. Seth Rogan plays the everyman to a ""T"" and Elizabeth Banks shines as the high school outcast turned hottie. Their chemistry as platonic friends is golden, and sparks truly fly when their true feelings finally come to light. You'll see familiar faces from both the View Askewniverse and the Apatow family, creating pure hilarity as both of these comic forces collide.Zack and Miri Make a Porno is less about making a porno than it is about everyday people finding their niche in life. Their niche in life just so happens to be making pornos. Zack and Miri Make a Porno can be synonymous to Joe Six-Pack Becomes a Professional Wrestler, or Joe the Plumber Makes Over $250,000 a Year. Venues who opted not to show this film, I feel are overreacting a bit. Although Kevin Smith's latest certainly lives up to the name, what we ultimately get is a feel-good movie. And a feel-good movie has never felt so good. In the end, Zack and Miri made a porno, and Kevin Smith made an awesome movie.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

It's definitely a flick about porn, not romance. It's funny, naughty and dirty.

The film appears to have been written in about two f***ing weeks.That f***ing ass pirate, Seth F***ing Rogan, is just getting on my f***ing nerves. He's f***ing annoying, playing the same lame-ass motherf***er in every f***ing movie. Thank God that fat f***, Jonah Hill, wasn't in this f***ing movie.Poor Elizabeth Banks.

Besides being morbidly obese like Michael Moore, Mr. Smith has run out of ideas. Yes I like r-rated comedies as much as the next guy but this one is not even rated. Red State went straight to video. Who keeps giving this washed up director money to make crap? Seth Rogaine is a terrible actor. He must be playing himself over and over again.

But, they don't live up to his past works.His movies seem to be more sentimental now. There is less of a focus on humor and more on drama. I don't think Kevin Smith knows how to write dramas incredibly well. When I'm seeing some of the more sappy scenes in his movies it reminds me of the visual impression I get when I'm hearing a 20 something or college student recount a romantic episode. There is all the bohemian philosophy and crude imagery you might imagine.I think we could do without the bohemian philosophy. I get enough of it talking to people; I don't feel the need to pay for a movie ticket to get more of it.The crude imagery has its place in some of the humor.

The Indian boss in the bean shop was the best, not to mention Craig Robinson's lines, he doesn't even have to make jokes, he's just that funny. Seth Rogen was funny as well, had the same comedic personality like in all of his other movies; deeply sarcastic and blunt, but in a funny way, and Elizabeth Banks is pretty sexy for a MILF.The reason it gets a 9/10 is because it had to have a love story in it. And although it made sense to have a love story in it as the plot went along, it was just a drag. I was also expecting to see something more vulgar than the feces covered face part. I wanted to see an actual ""money shot"" even if it's fake, and you all know what I mean by money shot. The mayo, the baby gravy, LOL. Still, it was worth my blu-ray purchase and I tend to watch it over every now and then because it has a great opening. 9/10 for Kevin Smith evolving his comedic film-making and comedic dialogue writing.

The production values are minimal, with some outdoor scenes shot clearly in frigid weather, others shot with plastic snow tossed around. There is of course no character development at all and it depends on a big suspension of disbelief that the storekeeper would be ignorant of the night-time shenanigans, but it's a lot of fun to see ONCE.

It was just the standard romantic comedy dressed up in R-rated humor.The parts that I found to be particularly funny were the parts that had nothing to do with sex; such as the lights being shut off in the apartment and all the problems Zack and Miri had trying to make enough money to pay their bills.This is definitely not a movie I would ever watch twice.

Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks reunites after their breakout roles in the hilarious The 40 Year Old Virgin and they made a perfect comedic duo. Clerks actors Jason Anderson (especially him) and Jason Mewes did their roles pretty well but Anderson's had some of the funniest lines in the movie. Seth Rogen's buddies: Craig Robinson and Gerry Bednob (very small role) were absolutely hilarious in their roles. And for cameos, there's only one but he's gut-busting hilarious in this one: Justin Long, he had me laughing so hard, I had to fall out of my seat!!!

A couple scenes were trying to earn shock laughs but if you've ever seen a real porno, it's just kiddie stuff. It's only surprising if you're 10. The movie moved slow and there weren't many laughs. Basically just a romantic comedy with a twist to it that makes you wonder what it could be about.

Boy and Girl meet, (Or in the case of this film, already know each other.) and right from the first scene they are perfect for each other. They have the same sense of humor, the same way of interacting with other characters, and essentially are two sides to the same coin. It happened with Jersey Girl, it happened with Clerks 2, and it happens in Zack and Miri. Smith seems incapable of writing a female character that acts anything LIKE a female. Zack and Miri has some amusing parts, and Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks are pleasant and work hard, but the script becomes predictable and the ending of the movie is hardly any sort of surprise.Maybe Smith can one day create a lead female character that is less than perfect. You know, one that doesn't just love comic books, or appreciate toilet humor, or be willing to make a porno for the heck of it. He has now gone three straight movies with essentially the same plot, and the same lead characters.

This movie is so offensive and so unnecessarily disgusting that I truly wanted to puke at many points. If I was watching this alone, I would've walked out the theater within the first 20 minutes. To find this movie funny you must be either, highly open minded, be extremely immature, or be borderline retarded. If I wanted to watch 100 minutes of penis's, balls, boobs etc. I would go online or rent some porno movie, instead of spend 20 dollars on this bulls**t. I gave it a 4 because it made me smile a few times and the actual romance in the movie was done well. Rogen and Banks show a good amount of emotion and added some realistic drama to the movie. What pisses me off is that this movie could've been a very good romance if only it didn't focus so much on its horrid crudeness and excessive obscenities and instead focused more on the romance part especially since Kevin Smith and Judd Apatow, the key proponents and producers of such movies, claim that their films all have very deep and heartfelt meanings. Bottom line, despite the few OK parts in the movie and the one or two actually good parts, this is a terrible movie and if you're looking for a romance, there are a million others that are both funny and romantic, so don't waste your time watching this one.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

There were so many great comedy movies on 2008 and Zack and Miri was definitely one of them.Two long time friends, Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are broke and are in financial difficulties. With no money, they soon realized that they can't pay all the bills and everything is just falling apart. They decide to make a porn movie to get back on track, but will this idea work or will it ruin their long friendship forever.Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks were hilarious in the movie, but I thought Craig Robinson stole the show big time. He plays Delaney and I thought he was the right actor for the role. The supporting cast were also great, especially Justin Long. The gay voice was hysterical and he just nailed it perfectly.Zack and Miri Make a Porno was one of the funniest films of 2008 and I think is a must see.

135,ftyl,Zack gets Miri Knocked Up...,5,7 December 2008,"Kevin Smith is a talented writer and no doubt an intelligent man but his latest so called comedy is an exercise in overcomplicated cliché which dodges any possible entertainment value in its premise to deliver a tired, meandering love story.Seth Rogen continues his one man quest to drown considered and witty comedy in an excess of improvisation. Improv implies mental and verbal dexterity - responding to situations with speed and verve. Here Rogen is just making stuff up as he goes along. This kind of interplay is annoying in films like the Pineapple Express (listen to the last conversation in the diner - three actors say nothing of consequence for almost 10 minutes) but in a Kevin Smith film, it is a travesty. Smith may be overrated as a director but his writing - in particular his one liners - are always clever and often inspired. Ben Affleck works in a Kevin Smith film because he does what he is told and the script makes him hilarious. By the same token, Rogen ruins Zack and Miri by neutering Smiths zingy dialogue with constant attempts at his own hilarity.Zack and Miri is all the more disappointing because there are whispers of a better film here. Justin Long's cameo is inspired, recalling Val Kilmer in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and Jason Mewes steps out of his Jay and Silent Bob persona enough to show he is capable of real screen presence. The supporting cast are generally excellent and Elizabeth Banks does well with her difficult role as Miri. For me, the real problem remains Rogen and, by extension, the Judd Apatow baggage he brings along with him. Apatows films are carefully plotted, often with very simple central stories, which gives the actors space for improvisation. In this environment, actors like Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent Rogen) flourish. By contrast, Smiths best films are dense ensembles with a vaguely connected series of events requiring very strict focus by the actors to maintain any semblance of order. When Smith takes on a premise like Zack and Miri and peoples it with Apatow alumni like Rogen and Craig Robinson it loses all semblance of form and effectiveness.Zack and Miri Make a Porno has courted controversy with its sex scenes (which are few and by no means explicit) and title but will be more remembered as the moment when Smiths sentimentality overcame his talent. The film lies in a no mans land between the View Askew universe and Judd Apatow territory but doesn't measure up to the weakest offering from either. Finally, Zack and Miri Make a Porno just isn't very funny and that, given the pedigree involved, is the most disappointing thing of all.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
136,westside-surfer,Blue Balls anyone?,3,22 October 2012,"When I first heard people talking about this movie they made it sound like the forbidden fruit of comedy. A certain mystic surrounded ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" I wondered if this was truly a gem or another over hyped flick.You probably heard what this movie is about. Two life long best friends that live together and never had sex are put in a financial crunch and opt to make a porno to pay the bills. First off the idea that a man and woman that have known each other all their lives and live together, not ever having sex, comes off as unrealistic. I ignored this aspect and rolled with the film. The cast was looking pretty so I figured they'd crack me up.The movie opens with an ""American Pie"" sex comedy feel, but with grown up losers instead. Seth Rogen play the same role he does in all his movies, the high school dude that never grew up. No that I have anything against that because he does it well. Elizabeth Banks is the hotty best friend that's given up the booty to everyone except this poor sucker. Banks isn't very funny and her acting skills are forgettable.The first half of the money is fairly funny but nowhere near as good as ""Knocked Up."" Early on the story is predictable, Zack and Mari have a thing for each other and emotions will get tangled up when shooting a porn. By the mid point the entire movie turns into a full on love story at the major expense of the comedy factor. At this point it was hardly worth watching so I skipped around looking for some good parts.If you've seen all Rogen's majorly funny movies then don't waste your time on this one unless you're a hardcore fan. If you take out the sex, the movie falls flat on it's face. Do yourself a favor and just watch a regular porn if that's the reason you're interested. Hopefully my review will save somebody a precious hour of their life.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

138,ruthierocks,Inspired romantic comedy. One of Smith's best.,8,2 November 2008,"Zack and Miri Make a Porno is very predictable. This is not necessarily a negative attribute, especially here. In this case, the predictability works. It offers nothing new or groundbreaking as far as romantic comedies or sex comedies go, but the thing that sets Zack and Miri apart from other films of its genre is the fact that, unlike so many comedies today, it is genuinely funny. Kevin Smith has matured as a filmmaker over the years. This film is likely his most sophisticated effort to date and it's easily one of my favorites from him, second only to Clerks. The dialogue, something Smith has never had a problem with, is top notch. The cast, especially leads Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks, are all great in their roles. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is not without problems, but it is, overall, an excellent comedy that rarely misses the mark.The premise is pretty much spelled out in the title. Zack and Miri, best friends since high school, are struggling financially. They have a stack of unpaid bills and no way to earn enough money to pay them. At their ten year high school reunion, Zack and Miri meet Brandon, the boyfriend of another guy they went to school with. Brandon is an actor in gay porn and seems to have made a nice living from it. When their power goes out, Zack suggests to Miri that they ""make a porno."" It takes some convincing, but Miri eventually agrees and the two set out to make some money. The production of the porno is not without problems, and these scenes offer some straight comedy. Zack and Miri are finally faced with the task of sleeping with each other, and although they promised it wouldn't change things, it does.Kevin Smith has always been a great writer. With Clerks, the production quality and obvious inexperience of the actors could be overlooked because the script was just that good. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is no different. After a few lesser-efforts like Jersey Girl and Clerks 2, he's back in top form. The film is just as filthy as one can come to expect from Smith, but it also features some great characters. Zack and Miri are just what you'd expect any pair of young, platonic friends to be like. Zack is fairly immature; Miri has more of a head on her shoulders. Both are very flawed, but these two are very relatable, lovable characters. The other characters are less well-written, but mostly good. The only complaint I have is the subplot of Craig Robinson's character and his wife. The black jokes just went a little far, and after awhile, became tedious. Jason Mewes, a Smith regular, is good here as Lester, as is Katie Morgan, an actual porn star, as ditsy lap dancer Stacey. Jeff Anderson also costars, one of his scenes being the one that sent my particular theater in an uproar of laughter.There have been complaints of seeing too much of Seth Rogen these days. I, for one, have yet to be disappointed by the guy. I guess a big reason that I like him is due to the fact that he looks like and talks like any normal guy you'd find on the street. He's not prince charming or Brad Pitt: this guy is slightly overweight, has messy curly hair, but he's still very watchable and is, at times, endearing. He plays Zack to perfection, combining the perfect mix of comedy and romantic realism. Elizabeth Banks is always delightful. She's a beautiful girl, but, once again, has that quality that makes you feel like you could know her. She is perfect as Miri. Supporting performances are equally good.Zack and Miri Make a Porno is not for everyone. That being said, there is a lot of vulgarity here, but the film is not devoid of a heart. Beneath the dirty sex jokes and over-the-top porn scenes, Zack and Miri Make a Porno is essentially a love story about two people who have known each other their entire lives and are just realizing their feelings for one another. As I said before, don't expect a twist ending. The film never becomes boring, though, and is about the perfect length. Kevin Smith has gotten a lot of flack for turning out uninspired films as of late. Hopefully this will put those voices to rest. 8/10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Well, maybe the raunchy part...The premise is this: Two down on their luck best friends (Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks) decide to make a porn film so they can pay the rent. They hold auditions for the rest of the cast (ugh... another audition of misfits scene) and then begin to film x rated versions of famous films.This first problem is that this premise has been done before and better in other films. The idea also seems dated. With porn so available via the internet these days, would anyone really care about a homemade porn film? Another problem is the casting of the very attractive Elizabeth Banks who is not believable as the misfit she is portraying. It is also unbelievable that her character would agree to do the porn film in the first place. It also bothered me how it was never really discussed how they planned to market the film to make their money back.The one part that did make me laugh was the high school reunion with a very funny appearance by Brandon Routh and Justin Long as gay lovers. Aside from that scene, the film was nothing more than gross out gags and cheap attempt at laughs at the expense of a decent believable story. I didn't buy the overly sentimental ending either.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
141,nathan-408,Brilliant Clerks I and II are better though of course,9,1 December 2008,It was brilliant but i liked Chasing Amy the best then Clerks II although i think this is a bit of a departure from Kevin Smith's other movies although i do know that he has changed his company from View Askew to Blue Askew which i was quite disappointed at because i really wanted some more films from the View Askewniverse but i liked Seth Rogen in this and i especially like the fact that Kevin Smith was actually happy that he managed to get 'Superman'(Brandon Routh) to look gay and i also liked the main movie they spoofed Star Wars which they turned into Star Whores and they then made there own porn movie in the movie although the film does get a bit boring throughout but it is still good and people don't really have to watch other Kevin Smith films to understand it although it does help to understand what his humour is but it is still a great movie.,Zack and Miri Make a Porno

At first, it seemed boring and working harder on being offensive than it was funny. That was my first impression. But I'll admit that it got better as it went along. See, I felt that the ""Star Wars"" idea has been used too many times and I was going to stop watching. But then they came up with using the coffee bar as their set, and that was different. Well, it's still offensive, but I'll admit that I'm impressed with their originality. If I have one complaint (and this is minor, really; it doesn't make or break my review), I do wish that Zack and Miri had just stayed friends. I did enjoy the ending, though. Good for them.

In fact, they should more entice you to see it. If you are in the demographic this movie is going for, I'd say 16-any age with a sense of humor, you like Kevin Smith and/or Knocked Up...there is NO WAY you won't like this movie. Miri is such a smokin hot pleasure to see on screen, Seth Rogen's hilarious cuddly dude humor is in full effect, and the supporting cast is absolutely awesome. Jason Mewes, the black guy from The Office, and Brandon Routh as one of the gay couple + many more, all great. It is the ultimate romantic comedy that guys will probably like more than girlfriends....and by the way my girlfriend loved it as well. (I USUALLY HATE ROMANTIC COMEDIES)Funny, edgy, sick, profane, balls out full frontal (male and female) nudity......this should've been # 1 box office for sure.

I started getting a chuckle out of the first 5 minutes. The reason I give this movie a 9 out of 10 is because of the focus on the Anal Sex position throughout their porno business. I personally think that its gross regardless of the fact that it had never really showed it happening but the only laugh I had gotten from it was the part where they did the constipated girl and when he had pulled it out, the girl had blasted number 2 all over the camera man. I would watch this movie many more times and once again Seth Rogen follows up with a good comedy. I recommend it anyone who enjoys comedies and possibly...anal entry.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

As the cameras roll, however, the duo begin to sense that they may have more feelings for each other than they previously thought.This is, probably, Kevin Smith's best movie since Clerks. A fresh new comedy about two friends and their urgency of money that makes them to do a porno movie. As usual in Smith, the film contains a lot of sexual discussion, nudity and, oh!, that vulgar language that makes the film even better. There's people that considers Kevin Smith a sick person. Because of the way he writes. But I consider him a genius! Even though I didn't liked, very much, his rated PG-13 movie. But, Clerks II was the relief of that cliché. Anyway, I mean this kind of movies makes you want to sit up your seat and go with him and tell: ""How do you come up with this sort of things? You're a genius, man!"". Seth Rogen, as usual, gives the funniest performance and he, I felt, that really was INTO the role. He really fitted in. I never imagine what other actor would be perfect for the character of Zack. And, well, Elizabeth Banks also has her greats. Unfortunately she doesn't go on full- frontal, but, still, she makes a perfect performance as Miri. Verdict: The best comedy of the 2008 and one of the best pictures of the year. Smith's best picture since Clerks. All Smith's fans will, surely, not be disappointed. Although, I would've loved that the movie lasted a few more minutes.Zack and Miri Make a Porno. The Weinstein Company. 2008. 102 min. UK: No Certificate. US: NC-17 (original rating).

146,MasterDebator5,"Kevin Smith's ""Porno"" Has Trouble Climaxing",8,16 November 2008,"Zach and Miri Make a PornoDirected by Kevin Smith. Starring Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks and Jason Mewes.Popular for his ""Clerks"" films, New Jersey native Kevin Smith proposed to mix things up with ""Zach and Miri"" by making a film that didn't rely on his old iconic characters, Jay & Silent Bob. He has tried this before, the result being 2004's forgettable ""Jersey Girl,"" and thankfully Smith has learned from his past mistakes. ""Zach and Miri"" may feature an entirely new slew of slacker characters, but Smith is hardly mixing things up. By casting old friends Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson in supporting roles, he gives his fans a bit of familiarity to branch off from. He also gives a supporting role to ""The Office's"" Craig Robinson, who makes a hilarious turn and steals every scene that he's in.The film's protagonists are the two titular characters, played by ""Pineapple Express's"" Seth Rogen and ""W.'s"" Elizabeth Banks. Zach and Miri live blissfully together as strictly platonic friends. They reside in a cramped, two-bedroom apartment, and only turn to porn as a solution to their otherwise insurmountable debt. Aided by their friends, the duo set out to take the industry by storm -- writing, directing and starring in their own pornographic film. Things get muddled as filming progresses when both Miri and Zach realize that their feelings for one another are evolving into something more than friendly.For the most part, ""Zach and Miri Make a Porno"" is filled with crude dialogue and gross-out gags that are on par with Kevin Smith's previous projects. It is only when the film takes a turn for the sentimental --playing up the love aspect between the main characters -- that it veers off course. Completely shifting gears in the third act, Smith winds up with an uninspired conclusion to his crass romantic-comedy. If the writer/director had taken a few notes from the porn movies that he lampoons he might have remembered that everything has to build up to the climax. Unfortunately, the film gives audiences a generic ending that is woefully predictable.Luckily, the strong start and charismatic cast give ""Zach and Miri"" enough momentum to remain an enjoyable experience. It may not be another ""Clerks,"" but it is thankfully far better than ""Jersey Girl,"" and it justifies Kevin Smith's choice to distance himself from Jay & Silent Bob. Just as long as there's not too much distance.Final Grade: B-",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Clerks and Chasing Amy marked lively, comic film making ground for Smith but since those heady times his artistic creditability has slipped. Zack and Miri Make a Porno tries too hard, then looses all creditability by trying to give the film a soul but we can see it coming and when it does arrive we are bored out of our brains or fast asleep. Smith still tries to shock us but in the new era of comedy Sacha Baron Cohen does it better. I'm wondering if I'll bother with the next Smith effort. Clerks and Chasing made me laugh in the 90's.

That's right, watch the titles, wait *through* the color bar, and don't leave until you see the parental guidance screen (again). I'd be writing a spoiler if I told you why, but if you like this movie you'll want to keep watching till it's *all over*.This clearly is not a movie for prudes or anyone who can be offended by (in no order) making fun of gay people (in a friendly way), making fun of heterosexual people (in a friendly way), poop jokes, in fact, jokes about or show of any bodily function, including copulation, swearwords of any variety, making fun of sex, making fun of marriage, someone sitting on a toilet, um well, offended by just about anything.

149,manny-97,"Okay Plot, But Super Funny Actors!",8,29 October 2008,"There's something inherently funny about watching porn. When we're with a group of people, we giggle nervously at the sight of two folks having consensual sex. So leave it to writer/director Kevin Smith for literally creating a comedy out of making pornography.According to Smith, he came up with the idea for ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" from his first directorial gig, ""Clerks."" In the 1994 comedy hit, Smith introduced us to a bunch of inane folks who want to make a movie. In ""Zack and Miri,"" Smith takes us one step further and introduces us to desperate people who turn to pornography to survive in this tough economy.Seth Rogen (""Knocked Up,"" ""Pineapple Express"") stars as Zack, a lifelong friend and roommate of Miri (Elizabeth Banks). Both are facing hard times and a mountain of debt. When the electricity and plumbing get cut off, they hatch an idea to make a homegrown porno movie for some quick cash.Rogen and Banks are so adorable together that the dirty deed of making porn seems like a fun, clean Tupperware party. It also helps that the stars are surrounded by funny character actors.Craig Robinson stars as Zack's co-worker, Delaney, who becomes the casting manager of their adult film. Some of the performers picked are Lester (played by longtime Smith collaborator Jason Mewes), Stacey (real-life porn actress Katie Morgan), Barry (Ricky Mabe), and Bubbles (Traci Lords).But the scene-stealer of the movie is Justin Long as Brandon, a gay porn actor attending Zack's and Miri's 10th year high school reunion with his boyfriend Bobby Long gamely played by Brandon Routh (""Superman Returns""). Long appears in just two scenes but his improvisational acting takes the cake.""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is blessed with all these dynamic actors working cohesively to create a funny movie. The plot is okay, but once it's laid out, it's up to the actors to truly make it work.Smith wrote this movie with Rogen in mind. When the director saw ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" he immediately called the actor for the part. In turn, Rogen suggested Banks for the film and Smith was smitten.Banks effectively captures the ""lovable loser"" role of Miri. It's simply astonishing for an actress to go from playing Laura Bush in ""W"" to making porn in ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" and shine in both movies.Like most Smith films, there are fanboy references to ""Star Wars."" The director, who's a comic book geek at heart, always finds new ways to mention the George Lucas sci-fi classic. In ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno,"" our main characters decide to call their adult film ""Star Whores."" Oh yes, there are many eyebrow-raising scenes in the movie. The MPAA initially gave the film an NC-17 rating until Smith fought it down to an R. There are sex scenes, obviously, and full frontal nudity but they are not gratuitous. There's even one scene involving bodily functions. Wait until you see what ""Dutch rudder"" is all about.""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is raunchy and dirty but it has a great, big heart in the middle. The only problem is, you can predict where and when that heart of the movie is about to happen. Still, I shed a tear or two when that emotional scene took place.But Smith, once again, showed his stamp of authorship and made a truly original movie. When Hollywood makes something authentic, I'm very supportive. Even if the film is about making porno. And for that, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" gets 3 XXX kisses",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

151,Newairbus,I'm With Stupid,6,13 January 2009,"WHY wasn't this movie simply called ""Zack and Miri Make a Blu-Ray Movie"" or ""Z & M Make Porno""? I don't think I grasp the neo-syntactical dimensions of the title. Maybe it has the same ""chique"" as ""I'm With Stupid""? Even that line has more logic to it, since it most often involves a pointing arrow, if I'm correct. This movie depicts a co-habiting, sex-free couple who drive around in their awful beat-up car until they finally fall on hard times as their junk bank of unpaid bills gets shucked off the wall into an empty barrel of oil. They decide to move into adult entertainment via a school reunion, at which it's permitted to plead sex shamelessly with just those same characters who weren't willing to provide it in the heat of '89, because they possibly knew even then they were gay. What a bellyflop. A moral hangover ensues for Zacharias and Miriam, but they hire local people who are susceptible to their rotten idea and thereafter after some difficulties come up with the great flash of genius of shooting porn in a cafeteria. (Chain cafés have lost their luster, haven't they? Hence not a service station, which used to be a hot spot for coffee and ""coffee"" in the past.) Ultimately the love Zack and Miri have grown to share during their prolonged flatmate-checkmate gets the better of them and... the end credits tell the rest. I can hint that they might start a certain kind of vanity production company. Which I might be interested to pay as a customer. It must be said that this is Seth Rogen's movie. His maniacal monologues as part of the dialog that he is simultaneously having with someone act as both his contributions and a narrative voice-over, not unlike Harrison Ford in the ""Blade Runner"" (1982). It's also his relationship with Miri (Elizabeth Banks) that the rest of the cast is kind of only supportive of. (They don't have mutual squabbles.) In a lot of ways the movie resembles ""Bad Santa"", in which Billy Bob T. starred. If you liked it, you'll sing in the shower to the soundtrack of this movie (including even The Pixies' ""Hey""). ""Bad Santa"" and ""Zack and Miri"" share foul language, foul aims, foul derrieres, filthy lucre and a central black ""fundraiser"". There is also a similar gregariousness and camaraderie underneath it all, which functions as the counterpoint to the filth and fury of the young-turk storyline.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

The story is excellent and the script is downright hilarious. I give a mountain of credit to the casting people for this movie: the cast was perfect. Seth and Elizabeth give stellar performances in the titular roles. Craig Robinson (of ""The Office"" fame) gives a highly enjoyable performance, leading the supporting cast. Kevin Smith regulars Jeff Anderson (Randall, ""Clerks"" & ""Clerks II"") and Jason Mewes (Silent Bob) shine in roles that Smith clearly tailored to their supreme talent. Justin Long steals the show in his cameo. The story, which some critics will label as predictable, is a sweet story of friendship and getting by in difficult times. It's easy to see that Kevin Smith mirrored some elements of the story from his own life.

Elizabeth Banks is very beautiful and just her makes the movie great. I have been a fan of Kevin Smith's movies for a long time every since I saw ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" like eight years ago. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys laughing non stop and is a fan of Kevin Smith, but I don't recommend it to anyone who isn't at least 17 years old because the content of the film is very adult oriented.

There is almost nowhere to go apart from moving towards the very expected ending, sad to also note some nice lines from the preview didn't even make it into the final cut.At its heart this a surprisingly old fashioned film, a love story that teaches how different sex is with ""the one"" you are meant to be with blah blah. Actually after ""Knocked Up"" and now this I think that Seth Rogan is starting to specialise in romantic comedy aimed at men.One last thing, I don't want to sound like an old man but I felt like a lot of the swearing seemed there just for the sake of it which is fine, whatever, but it made much of the dialogue seem clumsy. People don't swear THAT much in real life. We throw in occasional words to make a point.

As an example, watch ""Jersey Girl."" Just here he has a good balance for the most part. It starts off a little shaky but settles in nicely with crude jokes that earn big laughs. A diarrhea gag is priceless, a character named Bubbles has a unique talent, and the names themselves are great fun, take the David Mamet inspired ""Glen and Garry Suck Ross' Cock"" for example. It gets gooey but Smith keeps things down to Earth with an endearing love story about sex and the jealousy and uncomfortable and sensitive nature that surrounds it. It's nothing new. Everything mentioned has been explored to death on every network sitcom ever produced but it keeps its sweetness and that's really what counts here.Rogen is a big, doughy, lovable ball of enthusiasm and he's always fun to watch. And Banks is adorable, has good comedic chemistry with Rogen but most importantly both actors bring a gentle and heartwarming romance to the screen.

In Clerks for example the employees of more or less a quickie mart and independent video rental place. O yeah it was gross but it also was smart. He made some good points. This move proves that like Jersey Girls that he cannot do anything else. He cannot do love stories or Drama. This movie had the potential to be a movie that was raunchy yes but also made some good points about the porn industry. Instead it was like a high schoolers attempt at getting all of his friends in the movie nude. Yes ladies Jason Mewes is butt naked front and back in the movie. It is pointless. Utterly pointless. There is no humor that is above the ten year old level. If you really are a Kevin Smith fan you will think this movie was a waste. It joins Jersey Girls and Luther Reigns.

It's not particularly funny (certainly not hilarious), except in a very few spots, not well written, and not all that erotic. The humor is crude and obvious. Use of crude language is so much overdone as to actually get boring - and wind up lacking any punch. If this is what passes for modern film comedy, then it's no wonder that many people (my self included) much prefer earlier Hollywood work - when films were actually funny, clever, and often quite erotic, even without nudity. Just showing people naked does not automatically make for real interest, sexual or otherwise . With clever writing this could have been a good show.

Seth Rogan has to be the most overrated, most annoying new actor out there. What is his charm? Oh, big fat lovable fat guy? I think NOT. He's disgusting, and his big ego is a big factor in that.

And seeing him have sex in this movie, even in character, I wanted to rip my eyes out, in fact, I turned away from the screen and shut my ears and I could not even believe how stupid the people were around me that they said that they actually enjoyed this stupid movie with weak dialogue, oversimplified stereotypes, and just overall ridiculousness. It wasn't the porn that bothered me, it was the poor acting and boring dialogue, I would've loved to have seen this same story done, but with actors that are not full of themselves or conceited or big douchebags like Seth Rogan, and with a better script and to not have it be full of comedy clichés and stereotypes. Just ridiculous, the fact that people actually like this movie and go as far as to say that Seth Rogan is a genius and that this was the best movie ever is a perfect example of why people think that America is getting dumber by the minute.

The movie was quickly thrown together, completely uninspired, and should be an utter disappointment for former (because if you liked his work, you will certainly not like him after this) fans. He sold out to the make the cliché Hollywood comedy, with the looser who proves himself and gets the cute girl because they were best friends and secretly loved each other. Hurray. The movie also incorporates the new stereotype of the fat black guy created by the Apato folly, which basically consists of a stupid black man who portrays every black stereotype ever seen in the media, with the addition of being fat of course. Contrarily to the Hooper X character, a well developed intelligent, homosexual African American, ""uncliche"" as I would prefer to say, this new image of the fat black man has found its commercial value, and is bound to be used in future Hollywood comedies because idiot audiences find it appealing to have a black imbecile portrayed on screen. If you are black, this should definitely offend you, because he is the only black man in this film. But taking this point aside, nothing in this movie is good, except for the fact you get to see a cameo of famous porn stars naked (like Naomi). Congratulations Kevin Smith, you have succeeded in proving to us once more that we all have a price. For the sake of whatever fans remain loyal to you after this, although in my opinion, there shouldn't be any, if you future inclinations lean towards BS films like this, please stop making films so we, your former fans, can have at least a decent memory of you.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Rough language and some nudity but a very good central theme all make for a fine movie, you wont be watching with your mom..(she will have to catch with dad) but a movie thats funny and a love story, Listen closely lots of funny dialog that comes at you fast, you can miss gems.The actors were very good, a notch above clerks 2 shot smith style Kevin goes back to his roots by using a coffee shop as location. I will buy the DVD when it comes out to add to clerks 1 and 2. Don't stop now Kevin step it up stay independent, and of course you have a fine core group of actors..when is the next movie out???",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

If it wasn't for the concept, which is quite interesting, for Miri, which is quite hot, and for some funny moments, I would consider this as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. One of the most over-rated as well.It's more of another love story, one of those American and predictable love stories. And it gets more than 5 from me (5 being the borderline for a movie and a...movie-wannabe) because of those things I talked about earlier.A few good moments but a boring film in general...",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Based on my anecdotal and probably irrelevant observations, he seems to attract an audience of people from provincial, conservative backgrounds who have blossomed into self-styled sardonic wits anxious to guffaw at anything that aspires to buck convention. Kevin Smith certainly aspires, but fails to an extent that his fans seem willing to overlook. His usual unfunniness is accentuated in this movie by excruciatingly, unnecessarily long self-conscious scenes where actors we know can be funny labor under the strain of poor direction and worse writing. About 15 minutes in to the movie (could me more, could be less - it seemed like an hour) there's a scene where Zack and Miri talk in the coffee shop after Zack runs the teenagers off for taking pictures of her in her underwear. For an interminably long time, they banter, almost but never quite being funny, while the viewer endures a ""hey this is a funny moment"" soundtrack selection. Well, the moment isn't a moment, it's an eternity, and Zack and Miri is nothing but a string of these intolerable, never-ending failed attempts at cleverness.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

170,liamtoh55,Quite Good I think,6,30 June 2009,"So, I should start off by making it clear that I did enjoy this movie. The casting is great, and I find the concept interesting, but it does fall short of being a great movie. I'd like to think that Kevin Smith has attempted to tell a classic love story, but mixed with the seedy underbelly of our modern world, and in some respects he's done this quite well. The first half of the film has some very funny moments, and the characters were established subtly and nicely. My issue with the movie is the same issue I have had with nearly all of Smith's films, and that is that he seemingly can't quite 'seal the deal' so to speak. The movie is interesting and funny for the first 2/3rds, and then just plateaus to the end. Mr Smith has molded many strong ideas here into a good film, but just can't quite clinch a meaningful enough climax. I would still advise that anyone who is a Kevin Smith fan to go and see it, I just hope he can keep the pace going in his next work.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

""Chasing Amy"" was great...and everything after that sucked. The big problem with Smith is that he's still making impressive, college level films...with multi-million dollar budgets! This film just isn't funny. The most promise it had was the ""Star Whores"" theme for the porno. Though terribly un-original, I was prepared for and expecting some great gags when they actually started to recreate scene from the sci-fi classic...and they never went there! What a screw (no pun intended). And what is the deal with Elizabeth Banks. She so obviously was doing everything in her power to NOT show any skin, it's was pathetic (even more lame than Kristen Bell clearly not wanting to do nudity in Sarah Marshall).

I personally gave it an 8 because it had Seth Rogan in it being funny as usual and combined with some of the cast from Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob means its gonna be a funny movie. Laughed through the whole movie and loved that they got Katie Morgan an actual pornstar to be in it. Nothing bad I can really say about the movie other than I wish there were more pornstars or more pornish scenes in the movie instead of just the 3 that hey had in there.

Jason Mewes was also particularly funny, and so was Katie Morgan, who I recognized from two films that I saw in college: Katie Morgan: A Pornstar Revealed and Women In Black II. The lead actors were funny too.However, even with these strong performances, the film is very predictable and rather boring.

But instead, they thought,"" lets make it R so that way........uh......'. Exactly! So what?? It sure as hell didn't make me laugh.I love 'Mallrats' and 'Knocked Up'( I know its not the same writer/director).

Covering a scene doesn't mean you direct the scene. And when you base your comedy into dialogue, make sure it's funny, the dialogue was boring, scenes were boring. Having people behaving ridiculously is by not in it will never be funny. Smith is directing like a school boy that someone told him to make a sex comedy,"" oh, oh, what is funny, naked asses, feces, black people screaming, OK we got it, now let's go make a move. The only time he was funny was in clerks. And that's a long time ago and he doesn't get any better. I think he should quit.

177,porkepik,Kevin Smith trying to make an Appatow movie!?,6,23 February 2010,"(first of all, sorry for my English)Usually after every movie from KS, i feel the need to watch it again a couple times just to enjoy the jokes and dialogues as they are the core of its work. It did not happen this time. Why? Elizabeth Banks was pretty good in the usual female lead character of a Smith movie (pretty hot girl who doesn't mind spending her time hanging out with nerds...) and the rest of the cast was also good (it's always nice to see Jason Mewes and jeff Anderson). But honestly what's really lacking here are the dialogues. In the extras KS mentions that he let the actors improvise much more than usual and it shows as you get the Seth Rogen/ Appatow type jokes and dialogues more than the Clerks type.Performance of Seth Rogen felt sub par: the annoying voice and laughter that are his trademark somehow felt soo much more annoying than in his other movies (and i'm no no basic SR hater, i found his performance in Observe & Report pretty good). The way Kevin Smith likes to show his lead characters constantly in close ups and spend so much time talking is probably why i got reminded of it so often... Maybe Kevin Smith needs to work with people he doesn't feel inferior to, so he doesn't let his movie slip out his fingers (watch the movie extras where he mentions having wrote it with SR in mind, his admiration of Rogen is scary).Also the porno scenes were weird. The Mewes/Morgan was done exactly right (wonder why lol...), and the Banks/Rogen was just painful: okay porn actors aren't good everyone knows that, and making fun of that was just cheap and easy but most of all boring (dvd extras show rogen and banks were left to improvise it), then their sex scene where i guess the intention was to show intimacy and tension? Again failed badly. KS should not adventure in domains requiring good filming technique, sorry.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

There are many raunchy funny sex scenes that are really comedic-type rude too! Its not a naughty 24/7 sex movie. It is a really funny smart comedy that will certainly be a classic, and a another great thing is that there is a great love story in there as well, the acting for the love scenes would almost be as good as Titanic!

180,GarethBeaumains,"Zack and Miri Make Love, Not Porno",10,6 November 2008,"It was the best romantic comedy of the year for me.A quirky modern love story of the best spirit. A ""When Harry Met Sally"" for the YouTube generation. Not as innocent. Very crude. Rough around the edges. A blue collar movie about the blue film industry. Yet also very sweet and lovable.As my friend would say, and approve of, it was an off-beat romantic comedy... with a heart! It is a very humanistic, irreverent yet poignant tableau about how Americans, and people in general, are ever seeking love, yet ignoring the truth and beauty in their very midst.The whole ensemble cast deserves great credit. The chemistry worked all around, and conveyed a sense of humor and whimsy to what might otherwise have been viewed as a tale most sad and desperate. The twists turn everything dull and downbeat to upbeat levity. And from mind-numbing happenstance of the day-to-day blooms a very rich and uplifting comedic story of a ludicrous love affair.I love the informed slacker sensibilities infused throughout the movie. From the references to Dawn of the Dead in Monroeville, to the Star Wars spoof, to the modern coffeehouse-cum-porn-studio crossover. The show carries in it now decades of thought while remaining modern. People who are in their forties will feel like they are back in their teens. Young twenty-somethings who watch it may suddenly feel middle aged.Hence why I think the movie can be summed up in one famous last wry word: ""Grannypants!""",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
181,mcroyle,Zack and Miri Make A Porno -- Really Fast-like!,8,9 November 2008,"As a fan of Kevin Smith throughout his career, and loving the hype-up of this flick, I went into 'Zack & Miri' with rather high expectations. Overall, I was pleased with the movie, but something felt missing from this latest View Askew installment. Perhaps I'll figure that out after future watchings, or perhaps I'll just learn to love the flick more. We'll see.Banks and Rogen were cast quite nicely. Along with the rest of the supporting cast. Kevin has surrounded himself with great comedic actors for this project and everyone gives him their all. Casting not an issue on this flick.As with many Kevin Smith movies, you expect a rather solid script. With 'Zack & Miri' the script is solid. However, the final cut of the film left me wondering what Kevin left on the cutting room floor. The movie actually felt a little rushed to me. Now, to say that about a Kevin Smith movie is pretty impressive, because Kevin likes his dialogue. But, even at about an hour and forty minutes, the theatrical cut of this movie felt a bit rushed.Example: While I enjoyed the premise of Zack and Miri making love during the porno shoot instead of outright slamming away at each other, the build up to that scene didn't 'build up' as I would've expected it to -- well, perhaps wanted it to. And the lovemaking itself, while intimate as hell, didn't convey enough mixed emotion on the faces of the actors. Now I realize Kevin hasn't ever shot anything like that before, but that actual sequence felt a bit hasty too.It is so hard to balance comedy and emotion, and this attempt by Kevin is a valiant effort that hits and misses in places. And, while this isn't my favorite Kevin Smith flick to date, it's truly one of his ballsiest. The intensity of Zack and Miri's relationship plays well off of the outrageous comedy ensuing around it. The relationship, however unfortunate, sometimes takes a back seat to some good ol' fashion Kevin Smith 'di*k and fart jokes'.I guess, the flick felt a bit rushed, once again. Perhaps after another watch through the movie I'll have more perspective to draw on, but I will say this: This movie IS worth seeing, so put up your cash and go to the theater -- and look for me in the reunion scene...I'm in that bit*h like four times.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
182,pianoman904,"Forget what you think, this is a LOVE STORY! And a Good one!",9,2 November 2008,"Let me begin saying that I love Kevin Smith. But I love him as a film maker. So I was looking forward to see him do something new. I am a huge fan of his ""View Askewniverse"" movies, but I was excited to see him step out of his comfort zone and try something new. And the result was a surprisingly sweet and charming story. But hey guys, don't let me discourage you....there's plenty of Kevin's trademark raunchy humor and witty dialogue to keep you interested. Here's a brief synopsis of the film. Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) are two long time platonic friends who life together. The two find themselves hitting hard times. The water and power in the their apartment get shut off, and the have no money to pay the rent. The two of them face possible eviction. And as a last attempt to make ends meet they come upon the idea to make a ""porno"" movie. And through making the movie, they realize that they might have more feelings for each other than just friends. Now as brief and almost dumb as this plot may seem, it is handled with care and cleverly written and seems believable enough to me.The casting in the movie is great. Its a combination of the Kevin Smith clan, and the Apatow crew. The usual suspects (ie Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Jason Mewes, Craig Robinson, Jeff Anderson) are all hilarious. Craig Robinson was especially hilarious and Justin Long's cameo will definitely have you talking after you see the movie.All in all this movie is a perfect blend of comedy and romance. Its the ideal date movie. The guys will be cracking up at the crude humor. And the girls will be in awe watching one of the most intimate and sweet love scenes ever put to film.

Chasing Amy had much more depth in terms of relationships, how the manifested and where they went. I know this is different since we are dropped into a relationship, but the way in culminated felt so peanut butter and jelly. It was like, okay lets think of the most contrived ending we can and go home. I was disappointed, I was expecting more. OR maybe the ending just read better on paper.

186,sienadog05,"Offensive, Funny, and Touching",8,28 June 2013,"""Zack and Miri Make a Porno Film"" may sound like an exploitative porno movie, but it really isn't. It is about two platonic friends, Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks), who work in a Starbucks-like coffee shop in Pittsburgh, live in a squalid apartment where they cannot afford to pay any bills or rent, thus losing their electricity, water, and eventually, their property is condemned. When they crash a high-school reunion and meet up with a gay couple (Brandon Routh and Justin Long), one of them a porno actor, they decide to strike it rich by getting into the adult film business.They meet up with a gaggle of actors, including the always reliably funny Craig Robinson as the producer, and buxom real-life adult film stars Traci Lords and Katie Morgan, and not only do they make the movie, they also become loyal friends to one another. The gang feels for the plight of Zack and Miri on the verge of homelessness that they help pay for their bills so they can live well again. As their movies unravel, the two eventually fall in love.The gang has so much fun working on a Star Wars parody called ""Star Whores"" and its series with vulgar plays on the sequels' titles. Then they film two more movies in the coffee shop with, well, you're going to have to guess the play on words such as cappuccino and mochaccino. Only Banks does not show total nudity in her role, as the other girls do, as she is making love to Rogen on the coffee table. She is the most modest cast member in the movie, despite the pervasive foul language used by each character throughout the movie.What I like best about the movie is the cast and crew chemistry. Writer/director Kevin Smith, caught my attention when he was a guest reviewer on the then ""Ebert and Roeper"" show when the late great film critic Roger Ebert took a leave of absence. I can remember Smith being funny on the show with Richard Roeper, and he even cursed on the air, thus getting beeped. Rogen and Banks are familiar to audiences in cheerfully ribald and rowdy comedies, including ""The 40 Year Virgin"" that it was wise for them to act as leading man and lady in ""Zack and Miri."" ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a classic example of how a movie with a sexual title can actually have heart once you see it, which it why it was a winner at the box office, and it launched the careers of Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Banks and Rogen, and many others in the movie. Banks and Rogen, as well as Kevin Smith, often have had an urge to offend, but they don't offend to offend; they can also make you feel moved while you are being ""titillated."" Banks is always an intelligent (she graduated magna cum laude at the University of Pennsylvania) and beautiful presence that her blue eyes are always smiling at you. She uses beauty and brains to get attention, and that is why she is a winsome talent. Rogen is a cherubic-faced teddy bear who wins audiences with his burly frame and sardonic humor. Craig Robinson is a delight, whether he is in ""The Office"" or in many of his comedy movies. Watch at the end when he cuts into the end credits with his character's ""NR Productions."" Then Banks and Rogen get to talk about how they got to the be founders of this hilarious company at the end of this featurette before the movie ends.""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" should not have its title fool you. No, it is not for all tastes, but while it can make you laugh, it is also genuinely thought-provoking. And director Smith knows how to piece out the raunch, the language, and the feelings as he avoids sentimentality. Underrated? Maybe so, but it won me over.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

One small example: a fire in a garbage can in the living room for heat fed by a stack of old bills? What about ventilation, smoke, logic, fuel, the floor beneath the fire? And that's just one small illogical and stupid bit. Anyway, the acting, writing, and direction were terrible. What a complete waste of time. The meaning of true love, oh please!

It's been a long time since we've seen him like this, so in a certain sense, Kevin makes a comeback with ""Zack and Miri."" By the way, while the title suggest something pretty vulgar the film is really only slightly more vulgar then the ""Clerks"" or its sequel. It's just that some of the things that clerks only talk about actually happen in ""Zack and Miri."" And speaking of ""Clerks,"" the connections to it are everywhere. The opening scene sees Zack and Miri waking up, then comes the dialog's in the café Zack works for - pure clerks-style, and then of course Zack uses the said café to shoot the film - just like Kevin Smith shoot ""Clerks"" in the store he worked for. ""Zack and Miri"" are full of laughs, most of them dirty, others - extremely dirty. But unless you're going to watch it in the company of your grandma - who cares? Just look out for performances of Justin Long as a gay porn star, as well as our old friends - Jeff Anderson (video store clerk from ""Clerks"") and Jason Mewes (Jay). In fact it looks to be the first time that Mewes appears in Smith's movie, playing someone other than Jay, but for the same reason don't expect to see Silent Bob. But of course, don't be mislead by the porno bits and dirty jokes - ""Zack and Miri"" is first of all a love story, even if it's the weirdest one ever seen on screen.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
191,NickAngle,Kevin Smith Evolves By Making Porn,9,31 October 2008,"Kevin Smith sure has come a long way since he taught us about rigor mortis and ""snowballing"" in his critically-acclaimed debut, Clerks. OK, maybe not a long way. Smith's humor still falls squarely in potty-mouth area, with four letter words tossed about like candy on Halloween, but with his latest venture he finally departs from his beloved Askewniverse. In the process he leaves behind the adored pairing of Jay and Silent Bob, but it's all for the sake of progression, and progress he does with Zack and Miri Make a Porno.As soon as you've read the title you already have a fairly basic idea of the plot of the movie. Zack (Seth Rogen, Knocked Up) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks, W.) are ten years removed from high school and still have done nothing with their lives. The best friends share an apartment and barely scrape together enough to get by, and eventually lose their utilities and are close to losing the whole thing if they don't get some more money fast. Inspiration from some old classmates (Justin Long and Brandon Routh) inspires Zack with the idea of making, you guessed it, a porno. He gathers his co-worker Delaney (Craig Robinson, The Office) to fund the masterpiece and one of his hockey teammates Deacon (Jeff Anderson, Clerks) to film and suddenly business is booming. Of course there are setbacks, and romantic tension between the two leads, we've seen this before.It's worth noting right away that Rogen and Banks are incredibly believable as best friends who have the lovebugs inside them, a concept that's been done to death so many times it's refreshing how well it's portrayed here. Rogen brings the same razor-wit he seems to have in all of his movies these days, and there's a genuine sweetness that surrounds Banks in all of her scenes. Robinson steals the show as a 20-year husband sick of his ball-and-chain wife, another cliché that somehow remains funny, and Jason Mewes provides a hilarious actor picked up for the film, who's only talent is something that can't be described while maintaining journalistic professionalism. Regardless, those four are the biggest reasons this film works, though the rest of the actors chip in well. Cameos by Long and Routh as a gay couple work very well and provide one of the better scenes in the film as the two bicker and Zack merely watches and quips from the sidelines.While this film is truly a romantic comedy, Smith definitely adds his own flavor to it, which clearly separates it from the rest of the rom-coms invading theaters. That flavor is, of course, the pornography. An actor and actress each give a full-frontal view to the audience, and there are of course a few sex scenes, which thankfully are not horribly explicit. The movie certainly has a few awkward moments in the first few drawn out sexual escapades but the tension is lightened every so often by a great one-liner from one of the cast members, or a walk-in by Tyler Labine of Reaper fame.The movie plays out more like a typical Judd Apatow (director of 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up) film, playing on more realistic situations with witty dialogue and awkward pauses galore, which is a great thing for Smith to explore. Because of this, the movie isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as some of Smith's previous works, but funny in the sense of what's going on. Still, there are signs that Kevin is still the man behind the camera in scenes such as the one where Rogen and Banks bounce porno names off of each other, very reminiscent of some of the conversations had in Clerks or Chasing Amy.Comedy and romance achieve a nice balance throughout the movie, and the plot as clichéd as it seems still manages a level of respectibility and drama. You know how it's going to end, but how it gets there is vastly intriguing and the closeness of the characters really shows up in the final twenty-or-so minutes of the movie. When it gets down to it, Zack and Miri lacks a lot of the typical big time laughs of a Kevin Smith comedy, but brings with a fair share of emotion and witty writing to more than make up for it. Each member of the cast brings their A-game to this one and it feels very much like an ensemble cast, not a Rogen vehicle.Kevin Smith has with this film, demonstrated that he is evolving as a director and is poised to launch himself into the upper echelon of Hollywood comedymen with Apatow. Zack and Miri is not without it's slow points, blatantly uncomfortable moments, or utter cheesiness, but there's plenty of greatness everywhere else to make that a wash, and adds this one to the already big list of great comedies of 2008.9 out of 10",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
192,kaos_ngine,An absolute crock,1,13 February 2009,"I'm keeping it short as I don't really want to waste any more time with this prized stuffed turkey. Basically, it's supposed to be a comedy but I didn't laugh once at it's lame, puerile and totally predictable story line. Kevin Smith please give me my precious life back, if not please try to reach something slightly higher than the lowest common denominator. Hugely disappointed. Oh, curse you IMDb, it seems that I can't leave a review less then ten lines which could prove to be a tad difficult for this movie. There isn't anything positive to say really except I blame myself as much as the film makers to be drawn in to such an exploitative title.

193,cloverfieldowns,This sucked!!!!!!!!,2,22 November 2008,This movie was so dumb.I got to admit that this movie is the worst movie I've seen in a WHILE.First of all the jokes weren't very funny.This is the first movie I didn't like with Seth Rogen in it.The swearing and nudity weren't that bad but still.Zack and Miri are roommates and because they had sex in this porno they fell in love.And guess what?They had real sex at the END!!!!!!!.So this movie could've been better and it was't.I'll give this a 2 out of 10 because some parts were hysterical.And the part that the lady took a dump on the camera under her was disgusting!!!!She was constipated and hadn't crapped in days so the guy with the camera was taping her going through anal sex and BOOSH!!!!Crap came out.So 2 out of 10.,Zack and Miri Make a Porno
194,JakJam,Elizabeth Banks is an outstanding actress,8,26 January 2009,"This is a cute romantic comedy. While the plot is a little thin, the concept of two ordinary people making a porno film was quite comical, and they managed to do it with very little nudity (there is some, though - as well as a lot of cursing...not for the kids!). The characters are developed very, very well.Elizabeth Banks (the female lead) is outstanding. (SPOILER) She manages to deliver a performance convincing in her development of feelings for Zach (Seth Rogan). I think we're going to see great things from her...if she can manage to swing some better scripts!The secondary characters were also handled well. The show was well acted; and although the ending was a little disappointing, it was a fun movie to watch.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
195,shaunschon,"An unpretentious movie, that manages an incompatible match.",9,11 April 2010,"I wasn't sure what to expect out of the movie,and with the name being what it is, figured on a half baked comedy imitation of the American Pie genre, with crude jokes and a lot of vulgarity. It quite naturally surpassed those abysmally low expectations. If you're not too uptight and puritanical (or pretentious), you'll be able to look past the aspects you don't personally like, and maybe appreciate the humor and honesty in this film. The triumph of the movie is however not in its humor. I've seen plenty of movies that are a lot funnier, but the filmmaker actually managed to work in a perfect blend of romance, comedy, and porn. A sleazy movie that actually makes you go 'awwwww.....'That I believe is an achievement, on account of which you can overlook the flaws, that include the movie being quite predictable in terms of the direction of the storyline.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
196,c_hafer,Kevin Smith Didn't Disappoint Me!!!!,9,10 November 2008,"This movie is absolutely hilarious and is my tops of 2007 as far as comedies go. I didn't think it was possible for Forgetting Sarah Marshall to be one upped by any movie, but Zack and Miri did the trick. The dialog is full of witty banter and had me rolling on the ground for most of the movie. I mean you knew the whole movie what the outcome was going to be as far as the two main characters was concerned, but it was a hilarity ensued journey. Craig Robinson was a scene stealer most definitely! The drunk guy that walks in on the first scene of their shoot cracked me up beyond belief. I mean just when I think Kevin Smith can't make a funnier movie than his last, he goes and does it. Even if your not a fan of his movies, your going to love this film. Most of this movie reminds me of my best friend and I, but we'd never sleep together and definitely aren't in love. Just the way they interact with each other is very reminiscent of her and I. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone that wants to have a movie filled with gut busting laughter!!! Kudos Kevin Smith!!!!! Elizabeth Banks stock is rising and it's about time, because she is a gem in this film as well, so is Seth Rogen. All the characters in this film do a marvelous job....hands down the funniest movie so far of 2007!!",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
197,Steveoknox24,Kevin Smith makes a movie for the masses,10,2 November 2008,"Zak and Miri Make a Porno was simply hilarious. Though, dialogue driven with an abundance of references to the nerd subculture this film is certainly not as heavy-handed as Smith past films. Here, he tried to make a mainstream comedy that would delight his faithfully devoted as well. Smith succeeded.The first thing that a Smith devotee will notice (not including the absence of Silent Bob on IMDb's cast list) is camera work. Smith as gone from a lack luster director to quite a good one. His talent for writing dialogue no longer has to carry his films.The cast is also spectacular. Rogen and Banks play great performances. Rogen has been criticized for playing the same character. While his portrayal here is far from a departure, I believe you can see the range of comedy he is capable of. Both Rogen and Banks needed to play best friends who couldn't make heads or tails of love. They certainly pulled that off with flying colors. The intimate scene have this twang of realism when juxtaposed against the outrageous sex scenes of the porno. Critics have condemned Smith for the fact that the intimate moments are plenty awkward. However, that was the point. These characters don't know what they are doing they just know they feel something. A friend of mine turned to me during the turning point in their love story and said ""This is so incredibly awkward but that just makes it amazingly cute."" I think that is a wonderful critique as there are times in which you wish Rogen or Banks would turn smooth and woo the other, however, when it never comes your heart goes out to them as everyone knows what it's like to fail at love. Jeff Anderson also puts together a surprisingly good performance as well as Jason Mewes (which I'm not surprised with he's really becoming an actor in his own right). As for the real porn stars: Katie Morgan actually does really well while Traci Lords doesn't so much. However, their characters are pure effect and the performances don't hamper the story.And now the writing. The last great comedy I have seen was Tropic Thunder but even before that I can only say Forgetting Sarah Marshall made me laugh out loud. Comedies have been lacking as of late. This movie breaks that trend. I love Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Tropic Thunder but I have to say this movie eclipses those two as the comedy of the year. It probably won't get the attention those two garnered but it certainly deserves it. Smith's writing has improved from Clerks 2 and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back to top form. In fact, I'd even go as far to say that he's better than when doing Clerks as his dialogue is no longer the sole driving force (though it is still his strong suit and still in high focus). Is it raunchy? Undoubtedly, yes but it never comes off offensive. That is because Smith makes sex a non- issue. This is a great movie that tries to liberalize America in terms of sex. This line really got to me as a really good point: Zak; ""We started out f---ing, but we ended up making love."" The cursing actually strips the act of any meaning. It's saying ""who cares, its just f--- ing"". The movie says that ""making love"" is of real importance. Who cares how much sex you have when making love is the only time sex is important? The mushy stuff is great in this film as well. There were times during the Clerks 2 love story that I couldn't help but cringe. However, Smith made an excellent observation: love in my life is awkward. Now that he plays it as so, it works beautifully.Smith fans will not be disappointed but neither will the mainstream. This is a comedy you can get behind (sorry about that pun). You'll go in with a straight face. Sit through it in tears of laughter. And leave thinking the film as adorable. All despite sex, gay, and poop jokes. I don't know about you but I think that's one hell of a feat.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
198,SF_Omega,So bad....but so good!,9,2 November 2008,"It seems that there isn't anything that Seth Rogan can't do! Walking into this movie, I had very low expectations, expecting just a raunch-fest and little laughs. It definitely was a raunchy movie, but with gut-busting, roll-on-the-nasty-theater-floor laughter as well! The movie is about two platonic friends (Zack and Miri) who get into a dire situation and have to make an adult movie to make the bills. Throughout the film, they find out that making an adult movie together isn't as easy (or as straight-forward business) as they thought, and emotions aren't easily dissuaded. It's also about a ridiculous group of porno-wannabes and their outrageous acts throughout (I tell you..).The movie is so good mostly because of the acting. Honestly, the writing was just so-so and the movie had a, sort of, low-budget feel to it. However, the acting was spot on by all parts. Oh, and gentlemen, there are PLENTY of scenes with full frontal nudity (and ladies, some for you, too!).All-in-all, if you aren't grossed out easily (or, actually, at all), then go see this movie. It is hilarious, it's actually meaningful and heartfelt, and you won't leave it feeling like you need to gouge your eyeballs out. You will feel like you need a shower.Final thoughts: ""I *definitely* did not need to see that part.."" ""So many fine women and so little time...OH MY GOD, THAT'S DISGUSTING!""

However, ""Zack and Miri make a porno"" is simply not at the quality of previous Kevin Smith films. Sure, there are some typical Kevin Smith moments.

I kind of figured since it was kind of a mainstream title that it would be cleaned up a lot more than it was. There is definitely no shortage of nudity but it was the countless hilarious parts as well as stellar acting that really make this movie special.

209,noldcw,A Porno with Plot and Feelings,8,27 October 2008,"As Jackie Treehorn laments in The Big Lebowski, pornos these days lack plot, and production values, and feelings. Kevin Smith's ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" would make Jackie quite proud.The basic plot revolves around two friends, Zack and Miri. The two have a platonic relationship and live together. As they hit dire financial straits, Zack suggests they should make a porno and sell it to make money to pay rent, utilities, etc.I went into this film with some hesitation. I left quite impressed. Seth Rogen proves he can convey emotion and still be funny. Elizabeth Banks provides the perfect on-screen mate for Rogen. However, I feel, as did others who saw the preview, that Craig Robinson (Darrell from The Office) steals nearly every scene he is in.Zack and Miri heartily earns its R rating.

What followed my viewing was very unexpected. I was not blown away by this film, nor did I laugh nearly as much as I anticipated. This movie did not feel like a Kevin Smith movie to me. The dialogue is not as sharp or witty as his other endeavors, it actually sounds more like the Apatow improve style, perhaps due to Rogen, but maybe not.Zach and Miri Make a Porno is far from a bad movie, it's actually very cute, especially for a movie containing many of the vulgar words/actions that it does. I found that I legitimately cared for both of the title characters, was entertained by the supporting cast, and some of the dialogue actually made me laugh out loud, but overall the tone of this movie is unlike any Kevin Smith film yet.

211,roryculkin15,Tofu is more tasteful than this load,1,20 March 2009,"Okay, woah woah woah. I am sorry, but I do not understand how anyone could enjoy this movie.Maybe I am just disappointed. It was a Kevin Smith film with Seth Rogen, and I had VERY high expectations. For some reason my friend and I rented the movie thinking it would be about a married couple with some money problems that decided to make a porno for the money. But as soon as I found out they were best friends that roomed together, I knew everything that was going to happen. Really Kevin Smith? Are you going to be THAT cliché? So, once I found out how unoriginal the movie would be, I already knew I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.Then, it got worse. There's a difference between being vulgar and witty, and being just plain vulgar. This movie was an example of the second. To the point where it was disturbing. It showed people actually having sex. It showed a girl pooping on the camera. Was is funny? No. Was it clever? No. Was it overdone? Yes. Could the movie have survived without it? Definitely. Oh wait, but then again if you took those scenes out there would probably only be about 30 minutes of an actual movie. Whoever laughed at those scenes has a sense of humor that belongs on the dollar menu at McDonald's, because those ""jokes"" were CHEAP.And Smith had the NERVE to even try and squeeze a cute little romance plot in it? NO. NO NO NO NO NO. I am sorry, but either you are targeting an audience that likes to see straight up filth, or you are targeting an audience that falls for that cheesy lovey-dovey bull. Don't even try and interrupt one with the other. Like I said, I could tolerate the romance if it wasn't so predictable and cliché.Not just that, but the characters were so undefined. So is Miri a slut? Is she just one of the guys? Is she an embarrassing loser? Is she a vulnerable dame? It was like the writers wanted to combine every lovable trait in a protagonist into one, but it doesn't work that way. And it was so pathetic the way every other character in the movie was just this exaggerated, obnoxious, unrealistic mess, besides Zach and Miri. Was that another tactic used to make the audience love the protagonists? Again: FAIL.This movie was a mess. If it didn't have all these big names involved, then I think we all know the other reviews would look a little different. I give this a one star, and that's being generous.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

The movie has some of his most classic scenes by far, with some great performances and spectacular lines by Justin Long, Rogen, Mewes, and Craig Robinson who steals the show.

213,kentro21,Kevin Smith Makes a Kevin Smith Movie,8,3 December 2008,"Far be it from me to tell Kevin Smith how to make a Kevin Smith movie. Of course, only he can be the master of that. And that's exactly what Zack and Miri Makes a Porno is... a Kevin Smith movie in every sense of the word.But if Zack and Miri fails in any regard, its that Kevin Smith might be trying too hard to follow his own criteria for what makes a movie significantly his.In this film you will see plenty of raunchy humor and nary a sentence without a swear word. You'll laugh your head off and possibly pee your pants while simultaneously being strangely aroused.However, while you do all this, realize that little of it makes much sense. For instance, why is Seth Rogan's character broke and in risk of becoming homeless, while Craig Robinsons character does the exact same thing at the exact same coffee shop but has enough money to finance this porno movie? Why would two friends who have been in a platonic relationship for the greater part of two decades all of a sudden decide to interact in a pornographic movie together - especially when they hire additional actors? The basic premise of the movie and the first act definitely draw you in and make you interested, but ultimately many promises were made and never kept. By the end of the movie you feel it was all too contrived, too unrealistic, and that little of it made sense on a real-world scale.Kevin Smith tries to balance the ridiculousness of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back with the romance of Chasing Amy, but ultimately falls into a universe that does not exist. The decisions these people make and the characters they find are too far out there to believe on a basis of reality. That would be okay in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back or Mallrats, but the setup for this movie had lead you to believe that this was still going to exist in the real world. It did not.Elizabeth Banks will stand out for many as the best actor or actress in the movie and its not even close, though Craig Robinson steals the show from a comedic standpoint.Jason Mewes also deserves some praise for stepping somewhat out of his ""Jay"" character to deliver a good performance and for the most part make you forget that he is ""Jay"" The performance of Seth Rogan, whom Im a big fan of, felt forced at times. Trying too hard to deliver the line perfectly, and then ultimately feeling like it was a line read off of a script rather than a line that was spoken.I wish we could have seen more from the duo of Justin Long and Brandon Routh, as well as the coffee shop manager who most people will remember from The 40-Year-Old Virgin. And I wish that the scene near the beginning of the movie at the reunion had actually meant something on the grand scale of things, but afterwords felt completely meaningless and unnecessary except to provide some extra laughs.Which is what most of the movie is, laughs and not much else. I give the movie 8 out of 10, because it is worth seeing in theaters and does provide many laughs. It could ultimately stand out as one of Kevin Smiths 3 or 4 funniest movies. Overall, however, this doesn't stand up to recent Rogan movies like Virgin and Knocked Up or for Kevin Smith it's not nearly as meaningful or good as Dogma or Clerks.It is however a funny movie that succeeded in making us laugh, but failed in delivering any heart and badly in need of a re-write if it ever wanted to go above and beyond simply being funny.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

At this stage any normal male would be lost as the film enters non-comedic, juvenile chick-flick territory. As for the movie being 'dirty', if you like loads of excrement then yes, its 'dirty.' In fact the overall message of the movie is anti-pornography, so if you're looking for titillation, look elsewhere.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

I didn't even know it was a Kevin Smith movie, and I had no big expectations. But the way this movie goes down the drain in the last 20 minutes... whether it was from Kevin Smith or some new guy making his debut, it makes me sad. Especially after such a promising start. You know all along that Zack and Miri are gonna get together, but you hope it'll happen in a cool, funny, original or whatever way. Instead they decided to go for a totally unbelievable, gooey approach that takes all the fun out of the movie. Disappointing!Thumbs up though for Craig Robinson. He cracked us up with every line he has in the movie. Hilarious! Justin Long was pretty funny too. Well, like I already mentioned, the whole first part of the movie is really pretty good. Too bad the finish made my stomach turn.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

217,I_Should_Cocoa,Kevin Smith: Hello! I'm still here!,2,29 March 2009,"While some of the casting smacks a little of wanting to get in with the ""Apatow generation"", Zack and Miri begins in such a fashion as to offer familiar reassurance to his base, with two readily recognisable Smithian elements, a girl getting out of bed wearing a hockey shirt (Tarantino is guilty of this also, I can't be the only one repulsed by being subjected to a nerdy director's personal fantasy being realised on screen), proceeded by some ""toilet humour"". Do we need to be reassured that he has not nor ever will progress or change as a filmmaker? It may please the stalwart fans, but what about the rest of us? Just 2 minutes in, I'm already distracted.Plot details need not be recounted in full - there are no real surprises, just as the premise is outlined in the title, the opening scenes make it pretty clear what will become of the titular characters' relationship (they begin as best friends sharing an apartment). Perhaps the only surprise is how predictably the whole saga is played out.The comic potential is certainly there in the script, sadly it seems like Smith spent more time thinking up the title than the jokes - the only great laughs come from Justin Long, as a gay porn star, but he is sadly underused. Couldn't they have had him serve as some kind of adviser to Zack and Miri on how to act/direct a porn film? The rest of the script is staple Smith stuff. Familiar faces in the form of Jason Mewes and Jeff Anderson return from previous films, they are excruciating as usual. Vulgar humour abounds, perhaps more so than usual, but it's uninspired, and Smith seems uninterested in it, like it's a chore, and it feels like one. More likely it all seems intended to either mask or soften the blow of the extremely sappy reveal of Zack and Miri's hidden love for each other, but it only amplifies it.The porn production allows for a barrage of sci-fi film spoof porn titles. Surprise, surprise they land on ""Star Whores"" initially, none of the other titles were any more inspired than that. Possibly the most miserable moment in the film is a montage sequence featuring a novelty rap song inspired by Jango Fett. Star Wars is still at the forefront of his mind, it just comes off like the weak script compelled him to fall back on a tired, old and thoroughly dried up well of humour.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
218,jillfer,Smith has re-defined romantic comedies so that Men can enjoy them as well.,10,9 September 2008,"I just saw this movie at the Visa screening room at TIFF08 ( Sept.9 2008) and I was completely blown away. I must admit I'm a huge Smith fan, but I had major doubts about this movie because Seth Rogan dosen't quite make the genre of films that I like, mostly because he can write but not act. At least not until this movie. Banks and Rogan have so much on screen chemistry its nuts, and the musical score in certain points of the film made me ball like a baby. I saw this with some guy friends and even though the more ""touching"" side of the film wasn't a total turn on for them, The overall plot, direction, acting, casting, script and musical choices could not be beat. This film is irreverent, witty, loving and all around amazing. I don't know of any other romantic comedy that pushes the boundaries this far and can still pull you back in without jerking you around. I recommend this film to anyone who can find a theater that will screen it, and even those who cant, wait for the DVD.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

220,YarpYarpNarp,"Yes its porn, but it has heart",9,9 October 2010,"Kevin Smith has an unfortunate reputation as the master of raunchy humor.Clerks had some necrophilia and Dogma had a fair amount of vulgar material, this is true, but to only associate Smith with his raunchy is unfair. Smith knows how to balance genuine drama with his trademark humor, as showcased by the fantastic romance in Chasing Amy and the friendship at the core of Clerks 1 and 2. He does this again in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. This movie obviously is extremely raunchy, crude and crass, as is to be expected by a movie with this title. But with Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks, Smith has found two likable leads who develop a realistic and genuine romance over the course of the film. The juxtaposition of the pornography with this relationship ends up being the film's strongest aspect. Mixing tones is never easy, and if you mess it up it can be a disaster (the best example of this is Hancock). But Smith does so expertly. The pairing of intense, heartbreaking conversations about love and relationships with gross-out gags seams odd, but it works brilliantly. Smith knows his audience, and people who just want to laugh will be sufficiently entertained. But if you are like me and you want a little more depth, then this movie has that too, and I highly recommend you give it a shot.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Kevin Smith directed many great films. Zack and Miri make a porno is not one of them. It's an average comedy with no original scenes or lines, no style and even less director trademarks. Yeah, some scenes are funny, but nothing that we haven't seen before. Compared to Clerks it's a complete disaster, a waste of money and time. Worse than Jersey Girl, at least that had some style and Jersey-feeling. What happened to Kevin Smith? He practically invented this genre of foul-mouthed, chatty and absurdly real comedy, and see what just happened: Kevin Smith can't outdo his followers. It's a real shame.

222,psykoch4,Zack & Miri Make a Porno...But not a good movie,6,7 November 2008,"I went to go see ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" this week, expecting an over-the-top, raucous comedy from Seth Rogen (of which there could be no other kind of movie for him), and needless to say, I got exactly that. His previous movies such as ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" were very raunchy and crude, but at the very core had heart to them. That's what makes these films so special. Lately, however, I've found that their newest releases tug less on my heart strings and more on my gag reflex. Ensemble comedies made by Adam Sandler and his crew have had a few early hits, but have reached a decline as that type of humor has faded away in the American society. Right now, the comedic craze is the story of an everyday, average Joe (no political pun intended)finding himself in some extraordinary situation where he must prove his love for a beautiful woman and overcome every hardship along the way. While these films have proved to be heart-warming (as well as box-office smashes), I've found that they've began to lose their heart. ""Zack and Miri"" is no exception. While it has it's fair share of laughs, how endearing can a movie about a guy and his longtime friend and roommate making a porno in order to pay the rent really be? If it took making a porn film for someone to realize their love for me, it would be over before it even started! ""Zack and Miri"" set up the story throughout most of the film, and when the conflict finally happens near the end, it takes about 10-15 minutes for it to be resolved and for the film to be over. Personally, I think they came up with a funny premise, and when it came time to think of an ending, they threw it together as quickly as possible. It has it's laughs, but after setting the bar high with ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"", the only place left for these movies to go is down, and this movie did not disappoint...",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

And instead of it being that much into the sex part of the movie, it turned out to be a warm love story ending. I liked it, I like sex without being too hard core to make it obscene, and would say it had a nice nurturing love story instead of just the sex in their movie to make. Nice story with some of the sex scenes even could be considered a little on the innocent side. Funny scenes and good laughter too. Certain things in the movie can make you on the edge of your seat wondering about. Did she sleep with the guy, or did he end up having sex with another girl after they had sex together? Was their sex together enough to bond in love or did either one have more feeling than the other one? How was it all supposed to work out? So, some suspense and drama to make it all worth a good laugh and good wholesome relationships and love despite the sex porn in their movie, which was a climax to the film.

I'm a dude and have seen many a sappy chick flick love scenes with my wife so I'm pretty conditioned to them, but that scene straight broke me down, if I had been in the privacy of my own home, I would have wept like a baby. It wasn't the traditional emotional connection to the characters, build up type thing, it was just POW, and I was remembering what it felt like the first time I made love to my wife and I'm not talking about in front of a camera in a coffee shop. Smith is genius he uses the camera and music flawlessly. When Mews is banging chicks it looks like a modern professional porn, when Zack and Miri start out, its all awkward amateurish, totally drawn out, uncomfortable, then BAM! They start making love Hollywood movie style, the song couldn't be more perfect, very effective at showing the difference between making love and sex / f'ing! I'm probably reading way to much into this film, but I can't help but notice how so many people get caught up on things like language, raunchiness, the word ""porn"", or other ""morality politics"", and miss the point that someone is trying to make a statement about love.

The script was written by Kevin Smith for Seth Rogan with the part of Zach Brown in mind, and I felt Rogan did well playing his typical stoner, jobless self.Like most Kevin Smith's movies, the basis of the script is a love story that comes together in the end.

The use of gratuitous four letter words was unbearable ear spank. Every other word seemed to be F*** of FU**** or S***and then F*** S*** to the point to where you cannot even enjoy it because they loose their meaning and impact when they are over used. The acting was fine but this script was horrible. After struggling halfway through I had to turn it off.

Anyone who thinks this movie was good must have just laughed out of pure shock, as this movie is as crude as they could have possibly made it.

For example, when Zach put the hand warmer in his pants (for what reason other than to complete the so-called joke, I don't know) if you couldn't see what was coming, your an idiot.This comedy, I guess you'd classify it as that for sales purposes, relies heavily on profanity. Not that strategically placed F-bombs cant enhance a scene, but this is about all you get. It seems to be the only thing holding this lame attempt together.In a nut shell here is what you get: Some people telling each other to f-off, some sex scenes (Oh wow...shock me why don't you) and...and...well, I think thats about it really.Entertaining?

Zach and Miri Make a Porno is a film from Kevin Smith that came out in 2008. The theme behind the film, making a porno, I think is the main reason it didn't do too well in the box office. The theme is unfamiliar and somewhat controversial because of its low culture status. The movie's genre of a romantic comedy is really played out well between the two character Zach and Miri and they do it quite sweetly.

Jay and Silent Bob was just, I don't know, silly and not that funny. And Cop out, well, it was cop out... But this movie really changed my opinion on Kevin Smith. The story starts out as Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks being lifelong platonic friends that can say anything to each other. They get into financial distress and figure a porn flick is the only way to find a way out of this mess. sounds pretty good so far right? But then the movie starts getting really funny and also surprisingly romantic.

I love how quotable these movies are, being a dirty guy, most of my friends are of a similar nature and we always quote movies in general conversation.

In my opinion this is right up there with Clerks 2 as far as humor goes, while there is only a brief scene (maybe a second long) that make your jaw drop, as Kinky Kelly and his sexy stud did, the movie keeps the laughs coming from start to finish.It's exciting to see what's been dubbed ""The Apatow Crew"" working with Kevin Smith and Co. and everybody delivers solid entertaining performances especially Justin Long. Seth Rogan and Elizabeth Banks are great together, and have chemistry you actually believe in and while their story is somewhat predictable, they carry the movie well and Kevin Smith keeps you laughing so hard that you forget you probably know how it's all going to end.Great performances by all, Kevin Smith fans won't be let down by this flick. In my opinion the funniest movies in the last year or so have been done by ""The Apatow Crew"" (Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) but this one surpasses them all. Apatow Crew + Kevin Smith crew = Funniest movie since well....

Originality, however, is what his latest film ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" mostly lacks.While the concept of the film, two lifelong platonic friends making a porno, is very original, its implementation is not. Making a Star Wars porn movie -> very clichéd; two platonic friends falling for each other -> very clichéd; an African American man that finds everything racist -> very clichéd; an African American woman that yells most of the time -> very clichéd. I could probably make this list go on forever, but you catch my drift.Besides the concept itself the only original part of the film was about the 'Dutch Rudder'; through its originality that part very much succeeded in the amusement I wrongly suspected to find in the remainder of the film.My verdict: too clichéd/ unoriginal (as opposed to what we've come to expect from a Kevin Smith film). **/ ***** (2 stars out of 5)",Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Rest is predictable, full of cliché and way too unrealistic to be still funny.",3,29 January 2009,"""Zack and Miri make a porno"" is a standard romantic comedy, done completely by the book, that only seems unique, because it seems to be put in a rather unusual setting (they want to make a porno). But it's only seemingly unusual, because the porno they make is rather a romantic homage to the 80's porno movies (the ones that probably were really filmed with no budget in a garage, the ones with a ""storyline""), than porn would actually be today. Porn today is a very hard business, even pornstars only get a few hundred bucks for each ""performance"", they have to perform several times a month to survive. The 80's are over! And todays pornos come usually with no storyline at all.I have no trouble with 4-letter words. I loved ""pulp fiction"", ""superbad"" etc., so this is no problem for me. But even ""Zack and Miri make a porno"" makes extensive use of them, it sadly still fails to be funny. There are no twists or unexpected events in the storyline, there is nothing in the movie that will surprise you. It is as predictable as any Hugh Grant romantic comedy.Even if it is so OBVIOUS that you keep asking yourself throughout the whole movie, one important question isn't addressed at all: How does the couple overcome their attractional imbalance? Why would a very good looking woman like Miri fall for a totally unattractive guy like Zack? Yeah, I know, that they tried to make Elisabeth Banks look a little goofy with her silly hat, probably in order to make it less obvious that she totally outscores Seth Rogen in that direction, but they are way to far apart to pretend that this imbalance wouldn't exist at all.To make it more clear: Just imagine it the other way around - imagine a female character with the same unattractive attributes as Seth Rogen getting together with a good looking guy ""to make a porno"" and later develop this plot into a romantic comedy??? Would this still be considered funny? Or would it seem SO unrealistic that the rest of the story couldn't be appreciated anymore? I personally think that especially the male viewers would be nauseated and leave the cinema.We had the same attractional imbalance in ""Knocked Up"", but that movie WAS great, because overcoming this (obvious) problem was part of the movie, was part of the development of the characters. In ""Zack and Miri make a porno"" the only (really) funny scene was the character played by Justin Long at the high school reunion. He was hilarious. But his scene takes only 5 minutes of the film.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
246,jonevenh,Not really a review I just had to say this,9,1 November 2019,"I've liked this movie since it was released in 2008. I watched it for the nth time last night, and never really noticed how well scored the movie is until then. When Hey by Pixies is played during the house party I could have sworn he had written that scene with that song in mind. The movie hits every beat of the song perfectly. Also a highly quotable movie with great casting all around. A Kevin Smith film with Jason Mewes AND Seth Rogen, now that's right down my alley 👌 only complaint would be that I would have loved a cameo from Smith himself.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
247,matt-1651,Great promise but dull ending,6,1 March 2009,"I really enjoyed most of the movie, but I was very disappointed to see the plot take a turn for the ultra-cheesy with the inevitable Zack - Miri romance. Is it just me or did anyone else say to themselves, ""who cares who screws who, get on with life?"" Next time, Mr. Smith, please try to take your rules-breaking attitude and ethos a bit further and go beyond the cliché Hollywood romance that you trotted out at the end of the film. Boo on that.Otherwise, this is a good effort by the actors that is a lot of fun to watch - there are a number of hilarious scenes which left me rolling with laughter.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
248,tmwpons,Worse than the worse porno you're ever seen!,1,27 January 2019,Hell no i am not spending more time for this movie writing a review about it. Enough time lost already by watching the first 10 minutes.,Zack and Miri Make a Porno
249,lcthatch-29478,Wait until the end of credits.,8,4 July 2018,"I've seen this movie several times and it still makes me laugh.
Kevin Smith writes great dialogue that is funny and uses the jokes with the swearing and stuff well and not over the top.
Is internet references in this movie well considering that time that the movie was created.
Great idea bring former porn stars in the cast. 
All in all I think it's a fun movie and it's a shame that it wasn't a box office hit for him but as with many of his movies he's ahead of his time.
As far as movies go outside the view askew universe I would say that this is probably one of his best.
It has all the elements of a good Kevin Smith movie references comic books Star Wars and good humor.One more thing to add the end credits bet is absolutely hilarious",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
250,mcnabbster,Brandon st. Randy,10,18 August 2018,The scene with Justin long is hiliarious. If you enjoy these actors you'll laugh and love this movie.,Zack and Miri Make a Porno
251,nudeselfies,Amazing Film!,10,21 October 2018,"This film is nothing short of amazing. The actors and the way Seth writes all the characters in depth to the point where you actually feel like you're getting to know these people on a personal level is beyond crazy! Definitely recommend watching this movie but maybe hide the kids, as there are a few nude scenes in here.",Zack and Miri Make a Porno
