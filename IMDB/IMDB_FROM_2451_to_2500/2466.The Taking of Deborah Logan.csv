0,Leofwine_draca,Rather unpleasant,3,1 November 2018,"Another day, another found footage horror flick made on familiar territory, and THE TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN is absolutely nothing special when it comes to the plot. A film crew show up to shoot the day-to-day life of an old lady with Alzheimer's, only to find that she's in the grip of something more sinister. What follows is a slower burner travelling down all the expected routes, gradually building to a noisy climax that feels vapid and hollow, and a twist ending you'll see coming a mile off. I found the whole subject matter quite distasteful, equating somehow mental illness and decline with the embodiment of evil, and the whole thing left an unpleasant taste in my mouth.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
1,SnoopyStyle,faux documentary horror,5,7 November 2017,"Mia Medina, Gavin, and Luis arrive to do a documentary about Deborah Logan suffering from Alzheimer's disease. She's still functioning but her condition seems to be deteriorating. She lives with her daughter Sarah Logan (Anne Ramsay) in an old mansion. As the group films, Deborah starts to deteriorate but something more is going on.This is a faux documentary horror. There is a slow build which leaves most of the early parts of the movie lacking in tension. In the end, the standard problem of most horrors is ever present. The film crew is not strictly tied to the situation. They could leave at any time. The only thing truly holding them is the desire to make the film. That limits the intensity giving them a large exit route. The found footage is done well which gives an amateurish feel while giving a full viewing of the situation. It's not scary and I'm getting tired of this genre. This one is fine as long as you still find this stuff enjoyable.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
2,nogodnomasters,RIGHT AS RAIN,4,28 April 2018,"The film starts out as a doctorate study of an Alzheimer's patient and seemed very realistic, Having not read anything about the film, I thought that was what I was going to see, until I caught the early clues of the paintings (before he showed me) and Deborah talking to herself. When the film changed into a hand-held horror film I still felt a little awkward watching a non-serious film on a serious subject...but I got over it.Yes the film was going along great and then it happened. the same thing that happens in all of these type of films which now passes for entertainment: Let's shoot in the dark/flashlight with a jerky camera and people shouting and screaming. Want to make it good? Pay the electric bill and mount the camera. I understand they invented this thing called a tripod.It is a good movie if you can handle the flashlight screaming and not being able to watch the film near the end. I can't.Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Nudity (Jill Larson aka Opal Cortlandt)",The Taking of Deborah Logan
3,view_and_review,Although Not Unique Still Entertaining,6,24 December 2015,"The Taking of Deborah Logan is another possession movie. In that regard you can expect to see the same possession type actions that you'd see in any other possession movie. The Taking of Deborah Logan is done in found-footage or documentary style. Again, you can expect the viewing experience to be the same as any other found-footage/documentary style film. Yet, I still found it entertaining.Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) is an elderly woman that is suffering from the onset of Alzheimer's disease. In order to help keep the house and pay for medical care her daughter agrees to have a team film her. Everything that happens after that is textbook possession stuff but somehow it was different with an old lady. I think the child possession was too overplayed so they went in a slightly different direction.There was a mystery element to it: who, why, how to stop it? Of course there were your jump scares, but there was an overriding creepiness to it that was directly linked to Deborah Logan's age. When someone so old, fragile and withering starts clawing at herself or disrobing it just looks so much more eerie. No one wants to see an old lady naked and no one wants to see an old lady peeling her skin off. Aah! I just got the heeby jeebies just thinking about it.Considering this movie wasn't very unique it was done well enough and it just separated itself enough to stand on its own.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
4,trashgang,Some jump moments and an overall creepy atmosphere,7,29 March 2015,"What is supposed to be a documentary about Altzheimer turns slowly into a creepy flick about being possessed. Even as it do has it flows it isn't going to be a horror for not connoisseurs about the genre because there are a lot of jump moments and some stuff is really creepy and that just lays in the fact that the acting was sublime.But not even that, the first moment you come across the family who is going to be interviewed if you see them they already have something in their presence that will give you goosebumps. There aren't that many effects, it purely lays in the acting and the look of the victim itself so when effects are used they come in handy and will give you the wtf moment.As I said earlier, some parts were a bit weak but the acting do elevates, no pun intended, this flick to a, sigh, higher level.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",The Taking of Deborah Logan
5,Edvis-1997,5,5,29 January 2019,"Well I believe it's masterpiece. Idea and plot are high level. The problem is actors. They didn't convince me. Very poor,not professional.

6,851222,Meehh..,6,31 July 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Taking"" (2014) is a horror movie, but not particularly scary. It has old but cool idea, which could have been produced better. ""The Taking"" has some nice moments, but they are far and in between. The acting was OK. Directing was also OK. Overall, this a ""first person"" kinda found footage type of a horror flick. The premise is not bad, and the movie itself isn't bad, but it could have been so much better. It started promising, but by the end i didn't really care what will happen to anyone in this picture. All in all this is not the best not the worst flick out there - but i couldn't recommend it.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
7,UniqueParticle,Deeply disturbing!,8,6 October 2019,"The study and horror side of Alzheimer's is very unsettling! Quite enjoyable, freaky, fowl mouth documenters, and out of control hyperactive scenes. Not a bad film even though I am barely a fan of found-footage types.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
8,Reno-Rangan,Secrets from the past is about to explode!,4,4 February 2018,"It was released a while ago, but I was not interested in the horrors, because they are not my kind. For an atheist, horror films are mostly a joke. I do like or enjoy watching them, but I do it very rarely. This is not one of that. Frankly, I don't know why all the horror films are same, but different cast, location and situation.If you have seen sufficient films in your life, then you would also find it nothing special. This a found-footage kind where a student making a thesis on an old woman with alzheimer. As usual, something goes wrong and all hell breaks loose. So finding the root cause and stopping it becomes the main task for all who are involved with it.I am sure those who watch films rarely might have more fun with it. I mean edgy moments with all the scares. From a new director with a decent cast. This is another title from the recent that to have a name Logan. Like all the horrors, this too ended with wide open, but so far there's no news about a sequel. I hope they won't make it. I did not enjoy it, but still you could if you are not my kind as I've explained.4/10",The Taking of Deborah Logan
9,sol-,Taken,5,16 October 2017,"Keen to learn more about the disease that led to her grandfather's death, a PhD student convinces an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease to be the subject of a documentary, but the student begins to wonder whether something supernatural is afoot as the old woman's behaviour grows stranger in this mystery thriller. While the notion of making a horror movie out of a real serious medical condition sounds a little wrong, 'The Taking of Deborah Logan' gets off to a solid start with the characters only noticing occasional odd things about her. Jill Larson is very good in the lead role too - particularly in her more lucid moments as she expresses concern about being filmed. The movie falls apart a bit in the second act though as a clear supernatural possession element is introduced, subtracting from the mystery of why she is acting so weirdly at night. The third act though is where the film really trips up and becomes very repetitive with characters constantly shrieking and so much unsteady and unfocused nighttime camera-work that it is hard to become immersed in the action. Indeed, this is one of those 'found footage' films that may have perhaps benefited from a more conventional stylistic approach. The eccentric, unexplained behaviour of the elderly is a fairly decent movie theme, but this entry does not always feel like it achieves its potential.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
10,Thanos_Alfie,Deborah...,5,19 June 2020,"""The Taking"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a young woman going to interview an elderly woman who is battling with Alzheimer's disease but she finds out more than she was expecting.I liked this movie because it had a simple but interesting plot with much of suspense. I did not like the unnecessary screams at some points of the movie but I can understand it since it's a horror movie. The interpretations of the cast were above average and I believe that Jill Larson who played as Deborah Logan made a good interpretation. The direction which was made by Adam Robitel who is also one of the writers, was average and I did not like that he did not present very well the story behind some of the characters, something that created some plot holes that were not covered.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
11,damianphelps,Yeh Nah Maybe,5,2 February 2021,It has some good bits and some annoying bits and then there's the rest.Shaky cam is NOT my favourite and I consider it a cheap parlour trick and this movie has its fair share of it.The cast is pretty good.

13,Stevieboy666,Has a few moments,5,13 November 2018,"I am not a big fan of the horror found footage sub genre, it has simply been done to death. More often than not unimpressively. This one starts off fairly promising. Acting is OK and there are a few effectively scary moments. But then in the second half the plot becomes rather silly. Shame as I felt that it had potential. And naturally there is plenty of nausea inducing camera work.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
14,atinder,Now this is how you do a found footage movie,7,10 August 2015,"Finally seen this movie ,Let's just say , I didn't expect to see what I saw from this movie It really surprised me This movie starts of little slow just like all the others found footage movie , Thankfully this move it up a gear.I found the movie flowed really well , there were some decent scary jump scene that actually Work The atmosphere in this movie was great, It's nothing really new but somehow this movie , keeps on edge of your seat I liked the fact , there were not just based in one place .I liked how the story came to end but the last scene (which I saw coming ) Could have been a little more scary then it , i still smiled at the end .Really enjoyed that movie.7 out of 10",The Taking of Deborah Logan
15,GiraffeDoor,It's a found footage horror with a gerund for a title. And it's actually good. Wow.,7,17 March 2019,"Let me take a moment to explain that a while ago I decided on a rule: never watch horror with a gerund for a title i.e ""The ____ing"", they're never good. . Additionally if a movie is ""The ____ of ____"" then it's probably also terrible. But this movie beat the odds I guess.There are a lot of permutations to the found footage genre that need to be done before we can say the genre has been played out.Blair Witch 1 was about amateur film makers that got side tracked. This one is about professional film makers that get a chance to see things through.It's a slow burn but the final act really pays off with some freaky stuff that is not so over the top as to ruin the tone.I might be misremembering but there was a refreshing lack of the the usual tropes that I've become sick of and we nicely build up to the to incorporeal terror all the while with our characters never quite appreciating the extent of danger they're actually in. This is how horror should be most of the time.Not a masterpiece but one of the handful of found footage worth seeing.And no it's nothing like The Visit, don't worry.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

17,drownnnsoda,Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,6,30 October 2014,"""The Taking of Deborah Logan"" follows a documentary crew led by Mia, a young graduate student who is making a documentary on Alzheimer's disease for her thesis. She finds a woman in Virginia, Deborah Logan, who agrees to participate in documenting her illness, with the assistance of her daughter. What starts out as an investigation into Deborah's disease soon turns into an investigation into her soul, as Alzheimer's is the least of her worries.I hesitate to rail on this film for two reasons: one, the premise is genuinely interesting despite the possession horror trappings that it comes close to falling into; and two, the acting, particularly Jill Larson's, is astoundingly good. While we go into the film knowing the inevitable (that Deborah is perhaps not actually suffering Alzheimer's, but something even more sinister), there is still plenty of room for solid entertainment, and the writers have a heyday with it. We get it all: levitation, psychotic ramblings, a rural farmhouse, the occult, a serial killer, the creepy neighbor, wild goings-on in the hospital, and an explosive subterranean finale. While the film does recycle its tricks on more than one occasion, it's still playing its cards right.The found-footage angle is downplayed here in the sense that it's not so much a ""found footage"" film ala ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but rather a horror film depicted through the lens of a documentary standpoint. I'm indifferent to the angle in all honesty, because I think the film could have worked just as well had the camera been wholly outside the scope of the documentary crew, but I digress.There are plenty of fun and genuinely spooky moments in the film, and, as I said, Jill Larson's performance elevates it several notches over what it otherwise could have been. Anne Ramsay and Michelle Ang play second fiddle to Larson here, but both women are also really believable in their parts.Overall, ""The Taking of Deborah Logan"" is not all that different from the crop of found- footage-style horror films trending, except for that it's an exponentially better production all around than most. Yes, it is predictable more often than not, but it has an unusual premise at its base that does give it a bit of an edge. Like some other reviewers have noted, I too feel like the film does in a sense spiral into predictability once it cuts ties with its psychological underpinnings, but I'm a cheap date when it comes to films like these. Take Deborah Logan for what she is. 6/10.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
18,Pairic,Alzheimer's and Possession,7,29 November 2019,"The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014): Deborah (Jill Larson) is suffering from Alzheimer's, she is subject to violent and unpredictable behaviour. Her daughter Sarah (Anne Ramsay) finds it difficult to cope financially, emotionally and physically. A PhD student, Mia (Michelle Ang), gets the couple to agree to be filmed (in return for cash) as part of her research into the developing effect of Alzheimer's on both the sufferer and carer. At first Debby just displays the normal symptoms of the disease but her violent spells increase. Then a camera records Debby levitating and speaking in languages she had no prior knowledge of. A ""found footage"" film which deals emphatically with the effects of Alzheimer's before morphing into a tale of possession. A serial killer and murders committed decades ago are involved along with ancient Amerindian rituals. Some disturbing scenes, both of the depredations of Alzheimer's, telekinesis and possession induced violence. Scenes filmed in old tunnels are especially effective when the video camera falls misses time and crashes. Written and directed by Adam Robitel. 7/10.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
19,jfgibson73,The Taking of Deborah 1 2 3,8,27 April 2021,Pretty freaky movie. Very well done found footage with some imagery that is actually gets to you. It's about a woman dealing with Alzheimer's being filmed by a documentary crew. It turns out that more is going on than they realize. I think this rates above average in terms of how scary it is.,The Taking of Deborah Logan
20,I_Ailurophile,Surprisingly strong found footage horror,8,21 October 2021,"First things first: All due commendations to star Jill Larson for a fantastic, frightening, dynamic performance. She portrays the title character with a wide variance of range, nuance, and physicality that's readily captivating, and only ever more so as the film goes on; her casting was no mistake. Anne Ramsay is also very notable in the major supporting role as Deborah's daughter Sarah, a capable adult struggling to cope with her mother's illness, let alone manage it. Ramsay gives Sarah a strength of personality and tired charm that's powerful in its own right. And of course this is hardly to count out other cast members, like Michelle Ang, Jeremy DeCarlos, and Anne Bedian.The quality of found footage films can vary wildly in every regard, and I'm inclined to think 'The taking of Deborah Logan' is one of the better ones. Camerawork is for the most part gratifyingly steady. The root premise is an intriguing starting point, and the scene writing and overall narrative is pretty strong. It's a slow, subtle progression from a sad, sorrowful portrayal of a deeply ill woman - making us reflect on our own mortality and fragility - to increasingly disconcerting occurrences and aberrant behavior. The careful consideration in the screenplay is gratifying, and makes the feature all the more engaging, while also keeping us from guessing to an exact certainty where the whole saga is going to end up. At length, in the final third, the tension, suspense, and profound unease that had been escalating explodes into a greatly disquieting, rapid sequence of events that's unsettling, jarring, and impossible to tear our eyes away from. And though we anticipate the ending, that touch of predictability is more satisfying that it is off-putting.Through it all, the makeup and effects that realize Deborah's ordeal are superb, and the set design and decoration is really good. All around I think this is a really well-made film, and perhaps more so as a found footage flick. That slant can be a turn-off, and I was unsure about the very premise before I began watching. But everything here comes together so well that all my assumptions melted away, and I ultimately really enjoyed myself. Viewers who can't abide the niche genre won't find anything to change their minds here, but if you're even on the fence, I think the strength of the storytelling well outweighs any shortcomings. If not perfectly entrancing, 'The taking of Deborah Logan' is a solid, absorbing bit of horror that's worth checking out if you have the opportunity.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
21,begob,Keep it simple,5,24 October 2014,"A surveillance/hand-held cam story about the dark secret of an old mother suffering from Alzheimers.The premise is excellent, and the first half hour sets up some interesting possibilities. I guess horror is all about fear of death - the still of a dead Alzheimers patient with her mouth open sums it up.The story goes supernatural at about the halfway point, and that's when I lost interest. I think the problem is too many characters, too many locations, too much back-story. After that it does drag, even with the manic activity in hospital emergency rooms and cop cars zooming around the place.The character I focused on was Sarah, the alcoholic daughter - her uptightness was really well played, and there was plenty of room for her to develop. But we also got the researcher Mia, the bolshy producer, the camera guy, Officer Tweed, the ornery neighbour, the whispering doctor, and so on - all heroic in their own little ways, but no focus on a single character who will solve the mystery.In the final sequence there is an amazing image of the mother with a child's head in her mouth - inspired horror - but it had little effect because I wasn't in a state of suspense.If they halved the production they might have doubled the effect. Keep it simple, focus on the major character, and maintain claustrophobia to the max.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
22,quincytheodore,Achiving fascinating terror with good ambiance and enigmatic titular character.,7,17 January 2015,"In a war of attrition against her devastating disease and malicious unworldly presence, Deborah Logan slowly wanes right in front of camera. There aren't many horror films that have taken the fall of a person so daringly, it's actually taxing to see how Deborah gradually weakens both physically and mentally. The movie capitalizes on the sympathetic effect, and with it manages to instill frightening doubt for the character.Jill Larson as Deborah Logan is exceptionally effective. She can be utterly fragile but still bizarrely menacing when the next scene rolls. There's a lingering sense of dread upon seeing another person falters in lucid details; her thinning body and hair are particularly creepy. As she grows weaker the movie aptly displays irregularity with brisk pace and terrifying conditions.Production with the debilitating disease as well as the back story is made meticulously. It achieves more feeling of authenticity than most mockumentary style movies did. The pinnacle of its scare is when the pace slows down and barely a voice humming, this is a movie that takes time to set the dark atmosphere. Rather than simple shocks, it creates a more relatable unsettling situation.It's, however, still possessed by some of the genre clichés. There can be so many running and screaming female protagonists wearing white tank top before it gets dull, and that time has come and gone years ago. It's odd since the film at first sets the characters to be intellect, and while it does invest on Deborah, it could've been better if the other characters are more engaging since there is some good chemistry here. Some of them are meant to be genuine, but they come across as annoying.The movie might not reinvent the found footage genre, but it brings atmospheric horror and thoroughly terrorizing main character.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
23,suite92,Passable shaky cam possession story.,4,11 September 2016,"Mia, as part of her PhD thesis effort, arranges grant money to help Sarah Logan take care of her ailing mother Deborah. The condition for Sarah to get the money (and save the farm) is that Mia has to complete a film. The film is to document the sort of life that Deborah has because of her illness, and how Sarah is also affected. Gavin and Luis are Mia's techies, who are put down immediately and repeatedly as sub-humans. The representatives of medicine and law, Dr Nazir and Deputy Tweed, are both women.The early part of the movie includes results of medical testing of Deborah, and brief discussions of aspects of the disease that we think we understand. Some of the visual presentation here is fine.Deborah's disease progresses more rapidly than expected. The not so subtle horror clichés telegraph the general type of trouble to come.

I watch horror films to get spooked and it actually did so fair play. I'm also a bit of a sucker for hand held films, I think it adds a bit of realism to the film making it scarier. Some of my favourite horror films are hand held. Jill Larson was genuinely terrifying, I don't think there's many actresses that could look that terrifying. The bit where she had her mouth over that kids head was mortifying, I truly didn't expect to see that when she went around the corner.

29,ArchonCinemaReviews,Larson and Ramsay save this fizzled out horror with their acting,5,31 December 2014,"It's the worst when a highly anticipated horror film is a let down. The Taking of Deborah Logan, why you no live up to expectations? This time, the independent filmmakers for The Taking of Deborah Logan utilize the documentary film style within the horror genre setting it in a medical documentary about Alzheimer's disease.Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) is a single mother who is slowly descending into the horrid and debilitating disease. Her daughter Sarah, portrayed by Anne Ramsay, is her only family and therefore caretaker of her mother during this painful time. In an effort to shed light on Alzheimer's and earn a little money to pay for medical bills, the Logan's invite Mia Medina (Michelle Ang) and her film crew who hope to make a documentary about Alzheimer's disease. Under the watchful journalistic eye of the camera, Deborah Logan exhibits strange and malevolent behavior not attributed to degenerative dementia, perhaps of a more sinister cause.Once again the horror genre uses a documentary approach, though not original in any way, the use of Alzheimer's as a cover for demonic possession is quite unique. Jill Larson is marvelously subtle, slightly uptight, clinging to a semblance of her old self as she slowly slips into madness despite her desperate attempt at controlling it. Anne Ramsay is equally good as the tired loved one who is just trying to care for her mother, all the while knowing there's nothing she can do and the disease will only get progressively worse. There is an innate relationship dynamic between Ramsay and Larson and it is the only savior for the film.The Taking of Deborah Logan is a slowly paced film, primarily due to the extremely medical nature of the first half of the film. The documentary crew are detached, impersonal and it is impossible for the audience to connect or engage with the film when the focus is on them. Further, Michelle Ang's acting ability is a clear notch below both Ramsay and Larson. Once the horror begins to take off, which is rather abrupt, the film becomes increasingly more difficult to follow visually. The actions are creepy and unnerving but no real sense of horror comes across.With such slow pacing throughout the majority of The Taking of Deborah Logan, the end is rushed and improbable. The documentary crew immediately behave like paranormal documentarians at the very first sight of odd behavior, which is improbable. The entire end of the film is unlike how real characters would act and the backstory associated with Deborah Logan's descent into insanity seems like an afterthought.Please check out our website for all the recent releases reviewed in full.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
30,ericrnolan,It's a nice variation of the found-footage horror movie.,7,25 April 2015,"""The Taking of Deborah Logan"" (2014) was decent enough; I'd give it a 7 out of 10. It's a nice variation of the found-footage horror movie. It begins as a straightforward documentary-in-production, as a young film crew follows a troubled Alzheimer's patient. Then it becomes apparent that there are even darker forces at work.There's nothing terribly new here, but it's still scary enough. The pacing is a bit slow, the special effects were nothing new, but the makeup effects were very well done. There's a very nice touch at the very end.Jill Larson is fantastic in the title role. Seriously, where did they find this woman? She's a superb actress, even playing the ""normal"" Deborah Logan with charm and sympathy. The screenwriters should have shown us more of the unafflicted Deborah, to raise the stakes emotionally when she gets all demonified.It's also fun seeing Anne Ramsay again; she's a cool, fun actress. Does anyone else remember her as Jamie's wacky sister in ""Mad About You?"" I used to love that show when I was in my 20's.

31,jamiedarlow-37510,One of the best found footage horrors recently!,7,27 June 2020,"Mia (Michelle Ang) is a film student who is working on a thesis about Alzheimer's disease. She and two cameramen embark on a documentary about Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) a woman with all the worse symptoms of the disease and they stay in the house documenting her experience. The longer they study Deborah's downward spiral, the more it becomes apparent that there's something more sinister taking hold of the poor lady. It does suffer from relying on jump scares too much at times but when it's really creepy is in the silent intense moments. The slow shot of Deborah looking back into the lens while playing piano; like the devil itself staring into your soul.... Or a certain devouring scene which made my jaw drop. Scenes like this stayed in my mind for a while and makes it worth watching for any horror fan along with the disturbing lore in the reveal, pretty good performances including Anne Ramsay as Deborah's daughter Sarah and passionate direction from Adam Robitel (Insidious: The Last Key, Escape Room) When the characters around Deborah are pulling together to find a solution, you genuinely feel there and supportive of them as well which was a massive contribution to the interesting storyline",The Taking of Deborah Logan

As soon as they find the body things start to pick up a little bit, which regained some of my interest.The found footage genre has had so many cash grabbers, and so many attempts to do something interesting... this movie tries to bring attention to Alzheimer's early on, but that feels tacked on as they never go into it again. I think Harris getting attacked by a hospital room TV was one of the silliest things I've ever seen.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

The initial setup is a false sense of hope, leading us blindly into a boring hour and a half that will make you go more mad than Deborah Logan. It's extremely slow to initiate a stupid idea of Alzheimers gone wrong, violently and horrifically wrong. Towards the end you begin to think that this same old film is more like a found footage zombie film instead of an intellectual mockumentary. I'll reiterate, nothing is good about this film. Nothing is original or fun about this film. They take a serious medical issue and screw you with it, giving little care to such a sensitive topic. It's neither ballsy enough to be a gore fest, nor poetic to be a cult classic of sorts. It will almost make you wish you had Alzheimer's so you can forget this atrocity of a movie.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

37,totalovrdose,A Satisfying Horror Film,8,12 November 2014,"Almost every second horror movie released appears to be in the form of the 'found footage' style, and though this initially proved original, it so often feels overdone. Unlike in other films where people are running around with a camera for the sole justification that they can run around with a camera, in the Taking of Deborah Logan, the developers cleverly detail a reason behind this directorial decision. Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) has been selected to be Mia's (Michelle Ang) subject for her doctoral thesis concerning Alzheimer's. Over the course of the movie, the audience views the content from either the cameras, individually positioned in several rooms of Ms Logan's residence, or from the hand held perspective of one of the two men accompanying Mia on her journey.Although many movies in the horror genre immediately thrust the audience into a particularly gruesome scene (think The Ring, The Conjuring, Haunt, etc), so everyone realizes the kind of film they are watching, The Taking of Deborah Logan appears very welcoming. The home of Ms. Logan is inviting, while Deborah appears delightful and content, alongside her compassionate daughter Sara (Anne Ramsay). The build up to the horror is drawn out, efficaciously building the tension.On occasion, the scares are stale, cliché offerings that have been performed in previous features, and in other instances, the tension fades as repetitiveness takes over. Moreover, the perpetual darkness of the evening scenes sometimes felt a little too deliberate, as I myself personally contemplated why no one was turning on any of the household lights.Despite this, a number of other moments are uniquely original, and in these instances, the film not only captivates the audience, but just as easily disturbs them. A majority of this is thanks to Ms. Larson, who is brilliant in this role. One minute, she is sweet and caring, while the next, she is fearsome and formidable, and neither us, nor the characters, are prepared for who we are going to meet whenever she appears on screen.Unlike other horror films, where many cast members run around like chooks with their heads cut off when everything goes disastrously wrong, characters in The Taking of Deborah Logan attempt to thwart the terror that is crippling them intelligently and rationally. The origins of the malevolent threat is not revealed to the viewers for a considerable period of time, and because of this, viewer's minds are able to concoct a mix of horrifying possibilities, again, being used as a great tension builder.The ending of the movie is inconclusive for some characters, and the sub-plots mentioned during the film, including Mia's grandfather and his battles with Alzheimer's, and the relationship between Sara and her paramour, could have been further developed to have greater significance, the film instead choosing to focus solely on Ms. Logan's dilemma, which consistently helps to ground us in the moment.Whether you decide to purchase or rent The Taking of Deborah Logan, you will more than likely be thoroughly impressed with the decision to watch this particular film. It is, in no way, the scariest movie ever made, but it is certainly a satisfying horror feature that you will surely wish to view more than once.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
38,lnvicta,An above average found-footage movie with a lot of chills and a little cheese.,6,19 May 2015,"The Taking of Deborah Logan is a creepy, creepy movie. If you want a good midnight creepfest then this will certainly do the job. The plot revolves around this girl and her camera crew who's studying Deborah Logan for her Ph. D thesis on Alzheimer's disease. Deborah's daughter Sarah is the one who sets this whole thing up and is basically the movie's protagonist and is a necessary part of getting through to Deborah during the rough times and helping mediate with the camera crew and whatnot.Let me say right off the bat, the acting in this movie is very good. Well above average for a horror movie, and it almost gave me a Babadook vibe because its about a woman dealing with something difficult and her slow descent into madness. Both movies feel more like character studies rather than flat out scary movies, mainly because the leading women are so convincing and terrifying in their roles. Sarah was also very believable as Deborah's daughter doing everything she can to keep her own sanity while dealing with her mom's deteriorating condition. That's the main thing when it comes down to found footage horror: Whether the found-footage feels like a gimmick or not. And in this movie it doesn't. They set this thing up like a documentary. There are even a few medical scenes that explain the effects of the disease and how it affects the brain which I thought was a nice touch.Like I said, this is a creepy movie. It's very slow paced like most found-footage movies but the exposition is well done and interesting, and actually gets us to know the family and how they operate so we can really be affected when things start going downhill. Even before the supernatural factors start coming in, there's an ominous aura to this movie, tonally, it's just very down-to-earth which makes it feel like you're actually there, which in turn makes it that much creepier. So the movie nailed it on that front. Then when the supernatural stuff does come in, it gets even weirder and a few scenes get really intense. Some shots are extremely quiet and scary and you think a jump scare is about to happen any second but... then... nope, next scene. And I love that, because the anticipation and tension from that shot still lingers into the next, and then the next, until you feel it's going to explode at any minute. It's very well directed in that respect.That being said, there are cheap jump scares. There are some really cheesy ones with amazing build ups that have really LOUD sound effects to try to make you jump but just leave you like ""eh, that could've been a lot better"". But some scares actually pay off mainly near the end of the film and those are worth waiting for. There's also a lot of creepy imagery. Like, borderline disturbing imagery, because you believe this woman is doing these things and it's hard to watch, but in a good horror movie edge-of-your-seat kind of way. I really liked the tone of this movie, and I loved how they tied the disease with the supernatural stuff seamlessly. And there aren't that many dull spots in the movie - there's always something creepy going on whether in the foreground or background that keeps you on your toes.In short, The Taking is an effective found-footage movie. The atmosphere is unnerving as hell, the acting is great, and it definitely creeped me out which is all I can ask for in a horror movie. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the genre.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
39,richardwworkman,Urgh.. dreadful,3,29 January 2021,"It always amazes me that cinema, a multi disciplinary art form with hundreds of different people involved, seems to be capable of spending so much time and effort to produce something this bad.There are several layers of irritation to this travesty. The forced found footage mock fly on the wall documentary format is level one.The constant screaming breathless high pitched conversation is another.Repetition of the same scenarios, almost unwatchable photography, the painfully poor back story, the fact that after kidnapping a sick child they just let her do it again. Oh the list is endless.There's a body in the yard, oh no there's isn't, it's in the Attic, let's burn it, oh we can't, run around a bit, start screaming again.But for me, the absolute worst thing about this film is how it exploits Alzheimer's as a kind of access point for the story.This is a very poor film on just about every level.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
40,Lucabrasisleeps,Good Effort,8,15 November 2014,"I am an unashamed fan of the found footage genre. I personally do feel that with less shaky cam, found footage movies can be incredibly creepy. This movie also has some of the good attributes of found footage movies. But maybe there could be less shaky cam. In crucial scenes sometimes, the shaky cam aspect was more prevalent and that prevents us from enjoying it fully. But other than those fast scenes, the slow creepy scenes are the real treat. That image at the end(Ugh) - people who have seen this would understand. The scenes in Deborah's bedroom and basement. There are so many creepy scenes in this gem that I am able to look past its flaws. The performances are top notch. It is useful to have experienced actors in such low budget horror movies because they really elevate the movie from being a so bad it's good movie to a truly effective horror film. Jill Larson and Anne ramsay were somewhat famous on TV but they never got the roles that they deserved in film. This movie has both the actresses in full form. Jill especially was extremely creepy and to be honest, it is one of the best acting performances I have seen in horror film in recent years. I also liked the ending. Honestly if it ended in the other way, it would not have made any sense at all. This ending is satisfying and actually makes sense. Other than the shaky cam aspect, I cannot see many flaws. But still maybe I am not sure if it will be effective on repeated viewings. That still remains to be seen.Altogether, an effective horror film.8/10",The Taking of Deborah Logan

44,RMurray847,A reasonably effective and disturbing film.,6,8 January 2021,"Elderly Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) is under the care of her middle-aged daughter Sarah (Anne Ramsay) and as Deborah's Alzheimer's grows worse, the financial demands of providing adequate care have grown intimidating. When the choices seem to have boiled down to losing the house or taking money from a medical student wanting to make a film that follow's Deborah & Sarah's battle with the disease, taking the money wins out. So a small film crew arrives to document the Logans' plight.Pretty soon, Deborah's dementia takes some pretty rapid leaps forward. And soon after that, it becomes pretty clear that Deborah is not JUST suffering from Alzheimer's...it appears something more sinister has wormed its dangerous way into the family.In some respects, this feels a little exploitative. We all know Alzheimer's is a horrifying affliction with no cure. On the other hand, it makes a creepy kind of sense that a sinister presence could more easily wield influence via such a person. It gives the film an eerie credibility.This is a ""found footage"" film, and as such, doesn't bring much new to the genre. If the shaky camera thing makes you queesy, I can say that the filming in this is a bit less shaky than in some films. And the two lead performances are really well above average for such a film. Jill Larson's physical work on this film is startling at times, and while I'm sure doubles and effects were occasionally used (especially in the memorable final shots), Larson also just commits herself fully to her task. And Ramsay is really rather amazing here. As the put-upon daughter, she carries a weariness about her that is 100% convincing. Yet she has a toughness that comes through quite well, and she makes her interactions with the film crew feel real. She is the secret star of the show.The rest of the cast is pretty bland and generic. And the events of the story come to a memorable but somewhat abrupt climax. And, of course, the film depends upon people (in this case, medical professionals and parents of young children) to behave fairly stupidly in order for the climax to happen. You will certainly yell ""what the heck are you thinking!?!?"" (or words to that affect) more than once while viewing. And as with most films of this genre, there are a few minutes of ""filler"", where we watch the camera capturing uninteresting things while we wait for something scary to happen (and it doesn't). This can effectively build a mood, but it is also a very inexpensive way to make your film hit a 90 minute timeframe.In the end, this film is a worthwhile watch, in my opinion. Certainly I was engaged in it from almost the first minute, and despite the cliched film making technique, it adds up to a reasonably creepy and original experience. Not exactly Oscar-caliber, but fun for horror buffs.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

Be legitimately scary (not just startling, disturbing, and/or violent). I feel so sorry for Deborah in her Alzheimer's (and the possession)--which largely speaks to the impeccable acting of the actress. The acting of the main characters is really good, especially Deborah and the daughter. Even the neighbor is earnest and convincing in his support of Deborah. I also really like that some of the crew had realistic reactions and a limit. They also did a great job of building the creepiness without being slow and stingy about it, it was well-paced, and when they finally used a bit of CGI, they used it VERY effectively, in a way I didn't expect and legitimately made me turn the lights on the first time I saw the film. I am a horror junkie--it's my favorite genre--so I'm always looking for a film to really creep me out and/or scare me (it's extremely rare), and this film fits the bill.

The end result however, was disappointment. To start with, Deborah Logan is a very well made film. The acting is good and it has some very memorable and well executed horror set pieces. The acting from the Deborah Logan character was both sympathetic and chilling. Positives to come from the film is that there is time to connect to the main character, as she goes through her difficulties, making the horrifying moments all the more scarier. However, when you have a generic horror film, you have a predictable film! Knowing when the scares are coming and knowing where the story is going, leaves a lot of the suspense out and you will be left scratching your head thinking ¨I have seen this somewhere before¨.

No, this was very clearly about something else, something strange and unsettling. I loved the way the film turned up the level of unease gradually. The quick glimpse of a dark figure in one of the woman's paintings, for instance, only made more explicit later.

52,samgiannn,The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014),7,25 May 2016,"Alzheimer's is a terrifying and devastating disease that would put any horror movie to shame by itself, unless, of course, it also causes someone to be possessed by a demon. The Taking of Deborah Logan is a sort of cross between the mockumentary ""lost in the woods"" style of The Blair Witch Project and the haunted house security cameras of Paranormal Activity to make a frequently scary and engrossing little gem. The Taking of Deborah Logan follows, you guessed it, three filmmakers who are making a documentary, but this time it's about Alzheimer's. They got to the home of the proper and elderly Deborah Logan to film her life with the disease while her daughter, Sarah Logan, also gives commentary on how Deborah's condition has affected her. As weeks pass and Deborah's mental state deteriorates, the four believe that something else might have latched onto her dwindling mind. The film starts out giving some backstory to both Deborah and Sarah with small explanations of the disease along the way. It does make the dynamic between the two more compelling especially towards the end of the movie when Deborah is completely possessed. Although, this movie does fall victim to one little pet peeve of mine. Something that comes up in a couple of found footage movies that makes no logical sense to me is that, why would the footage be edited to include music or any extra effects that aren't on camera? In The Taking, they added little animations illustrating the disease or parts of a documentary they were watching. Why would they take the time to edit all of that in there when, by the time the movie is over, it's obviously not going to be a documentary anymore? There's also the fact that there are obvious sound effects whenever there's a jump scare. Speaking of jump scares, something I enjoyed immensely about The Taking were several scenes in which you'd expect an obvious jump scare and instead the scene just relied on its atmosphere. Those scenes are far scarier than any of the jump scenes, and although I like a good jump scare, they need to be earned. Jill Larson is incredible as Deborah Logan and is definitely one of the better ""spooky old ladies"" I've seen in a horror movie. The absorbing plot also distinguishes this from being just another possession flick. The Taking of Deborah Logan is a fun and creepy Netflix gem and a must-watch for found footage fans.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
53,DBLurker,Tries to merge Blair Witch with Paranormal Activity..,7,28 March 2017,"People are whining about Alzheimer patients being exploited, but the only exploitation related to Alzheimer is some old people shown in hospital in the beginning. After that bit, the movie becomes more about possession, forgetting Alzheimer altogether.So let's ignore the Alzheimer, just like movie did, and focus on supernatural stuff this movie throws at the viewer.From ""hidden"" cameras recording a creepy patient (played well by the actress) to people doing irrational things compared to what normal (real) people would do, this movie has it all. In-fact the only person that acts rationally is one of the documentary crew who decided to leave it all after witnessing supernatural stuff happening, and we never see him again. Wise guy.Rest of the movie is filled with creepy moments, which are then let down by the Jill Larson's character (mom) doing some of THE most mundane things when the camera closes up on her, or sometimes, not doing anything. Instead, the movie relies on quick cuts to scenes with loud noises, included her screaming, to jump ""scare"" the viewer.. which didn't work on me at all so THAT was fun..Same goes for hidden cameras, which are referenced twice when they CLEARLY show supernatural stuff happening, but are then ignored and never mentioned by the characters. No one even bothers showing the priest the footage when asking for help, FFS.Ignoring all that, I bumped up the rating to 7 from 4 for the last moments. They were well shot, mimicking Blair Witch properly and in a really creepy reveal at the end.Anyway, in the end, movie copies bits and pieces from Paranormal Activity (camera setups showing ""spooooky"" stuff happening) and Blair Witch (whole last sequence, surprise surprise, it still works) and only Blair Witch moments end up being creepy, which shouldn't come as a surprise to people who loved Blair Witch.This movie is worth watching. 7/10",The Taking of Deborah Logan

I know she did soaps for years, but her talent was wasted in those. Ditto, Anne Ramsay; this is, I recognized her but I'd never paid a lot of attention to her until this flick. She was also fantastic. These two actresses really lifted this movie from good to great. Michelle Ang was refreshing eye candy but she's no acting slouch, either. The film starts off as a student documentary about Alzheimer's, but then the production team and Deborah's daughter start to think that maybe something else is going on behind the scenes.

So many horror movies want to feature children as a source of terror, but to me, it's elder people that can seem frightening, when framed accordingly.The Alzheimer victim was truly scary, not only in her weird facial expressions, but in her potentiality for violence. At moments, she seemed like a bomb waiting to explode, which really made for some tense scenes. Excellent job acting on her part. Excellent.I am a huge fan of found footage movies, and this one didn't disappoint (although who was actually holding the camera at times was a bit off). The best thing that the lower budget movies can do (and often fail) is to not violate the rule of normalcy; in other words, we viewers will be more drawn to the movie if the characters act realistically . There was alot of realistic responses to what was happening on screen, including the one cameraman who pretty much decided to leave the project (don't we always wonder why people just don't leave when the weird stuff happens?). One thing, though; a few times, I was wondering why the onscreen characters just don't turn on more lights, and I questioned whether or not what they did was the safest route to take. But all in all, I didn't need to stray much into suspension of disbelief mode.Final kudos to the one CGI shot of the possessed woman starting to swallow the little girl.

There are was a good increase of tension/creepiness as film progressed and whilst the usual stupid behaviour of characters in horror movies was present in the film, ie don't go in there without turning the lights on , it was fairly solid with its storyline and the pace seemed ok.
I found to be a good little horror movie and it seems the found footage genre can still throw up a good film still now and then",The Taking of Deborah Logan
63,dana-kellish,Decent,6,26 July 2020,"Compared to other films of this genre, this is better than most, and one scene that depicts a character swallowing the entire head of another, snake-like, is truly inspired horror.

64,michaelant555,"For the love of God, ENOUGH WITH THE OVER-ACTING!!!",6,23 January 2015,"I haven't even finished watching this movie yet and already I have been compelled to come on here and write a scathing review. Let me take a breath before my freaking head explodes (which would please a few people). I've given this film 4/10 and, first off, I'm going to say it's watchable, to be fair. I have seen a lot worse. This is another reality type movie where they're making a documentary. This time about a lady with Alzheimer's that turns out to be something altogether more sinister and it starts off so well. The acting is good and the responses between the characters are realistic, BUT THEN, halfway through the movie the director decides to build the tension and create an atmosphere by making the actors respond in a totally irrational and unrealistic way. The film 'As above, so below' falls victim to exactly the same ridiculous mistake. And don't even get me started on 'Grave encounters'! People panicking and shouting for prolonged periods of time in situations where they would just be talking and discussing the issue at hand in maybe a tense, but normal manner, not arguing and ranting and becoming psychotically agitated. Use the scenery, plot, special effects, action and camera work, etc, to build the tension into a movie and not the actors dialogue delivery. I have nothing against reality movies and found footage films, in general, although they're not a favorite of mine, but please stop insulting everyone's intelligence and ruining a promising movie with COMPLETELY unrealistic character responses...Ahhhhhh...That feels better...stress leaving the body...becoming calm...compulsion to go 'Dexter' on the makers subsiding...until the next reality movie! Have you seen 'Exists' yet? When he rides off into the woods alone; Hahahahaha! They should make a short reality movie of the director in a small room for ten minutes with one hundred Rattle snakes. That would teach them something about character response, but I think those type of movies are still illegal. It's just a thought, anyway :)Update: Okay! I made it to the end of the film and I have to say it didn't make my blood boil. In fact I liked the ending and found myself nodding in appreciation (or relief) that they brought it to a close with a proper conclusion and with a nice pinch of spicy menace. I've now changed my rating to a generous 6/10. Thank you for that; I've just removed 50 Rattle snakes.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
65,Clive_W,Copy & Paste,4,14 February 2021,"The film felt as if it had been copied from several found footage films, or more over several other horror films, there didn't feel to be any originality here. The predictable ness is a sad let down for the movie, you can guess where the story is going, where the jump scares are coming from, even the so called twists are clear as day well before they even happen. Put that aside the film is well made on pair with other found footage style films, this one is no different, the acting in parts is questionable but overall you can still enjoy. There is a weird kinda feeling toward the end as if it feels like the film is constantly about to end but just doesn't and keeps managing to limp on with this broken story and no real momentum. In the end I do believe only 1 person actually dies, I believe this was the police officer, as somehow this demon is just not interested in killing, I know we don't learn the final fate of the neighbour but you can assume he lived, so double disappointment with the low body count! Overall pretty average film, in conclusion there's sadly just nothing original about this film but you can still watch it if your a horror fan.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
66,HorrorFreak1997,one of the best that the found footage horror genre has to offer,8,12 September 2016,"The Taking (2014) directed by Adam Robitel is one of the best found footage horror films out there. what we get here is not on par with the best of the best (REC and the Blair witch) but it is definitely one of the better films of its kind. the plot involves an elderly woman battling Alzheimer's disease. she agrees to allow a film crew document her and her battles with the disease, but the crew soon discover that there is something else going on with miss Deborah Logan.the direction here is pretty good. it is of course found footage so the aspect of most importance is realism and creating something that's immersive and thrilling. this is pulled off pretty well. while not being one continuous piece of film it still does a pretty good job at maintaining it's realism. there are portions though where the crew who put together the film edited in segments of documentaries, hospital security cameras and news reports etc. sometimes it takes you out of the experience but at the same time these segments are for the most part essential in developing the narrative. it also does make perfect sense that it's put together the way it is because it's a film put together by a presumably wealthy and dedicated student filmmaker. minus the hospital camera segments. they are only on screen for a minuscule amount of time and really have no relevance to the story or narrative. they just seem out of place in a film that's trying hard to be realistic. moving on from that notion though, the scenes that are done well are really done well. there are scenes of genuine tension and unnerving atmosphere. but the first half of the film could have used a few more scares. I will say though the scares that we do get are really well done and chilling. mostly due to the intense performance given by Jill Larson as Deborah. she really nails this character and creates some real tension and atmosphere with just her blank and empty stare. it really gives you chills watching her act in this movie. the rest of the cast are all good enough. they do what they need to do, and react for the most part realistically to their situations. the other stand out being Anne Ramsay as Sarah. she also gives us a convincing performance that adds to the tension and suspense.the story here is pretty by the numbers but it does have a uniqueness to it and was for the most part memorable. it unravels fairly quickly and is actually interesting. but the movie knows not to linger on it for too long. this is a key aspect to why it works so well. if this particular story was lingered on for too long it would have bogged down the pace of the film and made it uninteresting. but it spends just the right amount of time developing it, revealing to our characters, why it's occurred and how to stop it. so I should add the pacing of the film is great. we also get a very suspenseful and heart pounding climax that is extremely memorable.while not a perfect film it is certainly a great one that delivers on what it promises. good atmosphere and tension, some good performances, a memorable story, good pacing, and some good scares as well.the verdict: 8.5/10",The Taking of Deborah Logan
67,Fancytower,Wow! What a ride,9,2 November 2014,"First time in a very long time that a film has made me jump throughout the whole movie. This movie was creepy from beginning to end. It isn't deep or thought provoking, just good old fashion horror. I also like the fresh take on the possession genre. This film didn't use the same old formula. Alzheimer's is a scary and disturbing disease. It is especially traumatizing for caretakers of Alzheimer's patients. So in the beginning you only believe it's the disease but as the film progresses, you start to wonder if something else is going on.It I is a ""footage"" type film as the crew is there to film the progression of Alzheimer's for a thesis. But it is done in such a way that it stands above most other footage type films. Sure some minor plot holes or little mistakes but an excellent scary movie for a lights out horror fest.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

69,jinx_malone,Meh.,3,30 October 2014,"The idea of making a horror film based on Alzheimer's is a sort of tasteless one, isn't it? I know a lot of horror is tasteless in some way, but this left me wanting to take a quick shower. The image of an old woman in the student's pseudo-doc who's either dead or close to death early on in the film was unpleasant, but it didn't make me think 'oooh, scary', it just made me think the filmmakers were...let's be kind and say 'enterprising' for sticking that image in there.It's exploitive enough, with a frail elderly woman walking around naked, having painful medical tests run on her (just like Regan MacNeil! Surprise, surprise!) and acting spooky, which is one thing, but then it switches gears to a dead child murderer and snakes and kidnappings, and it should have been cut by about thirty minutes to keep the suspense up.There's an ostensibly happy ending for the old lady and her daughter--well, about as happy as you can get with a story about a possessed Alzheimer's patient, and yes, that does feel very silly to write--but an extremely stupid and out of left field 'evil continues' ending is tacked on for a character we don't care about, since she's in the film for all of five minutes, tops.I found it more effective as a horror film when it was dealing with Deborah as a victim of Alzheimer's and not Deborah as a possessed snake lady. The woman who plays Deborah should get some kind of reward for wasting her time in this, as she turns in a decent performance. Mileage may vary, but I thought this was an absolutely terrible film, and the supernatural second half was boring as boring can be.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

After following the patient (Deborah) and her daughter for a few weeks, they start to unravel a darker story.I enjoyed the movie, although I found myself a bit bored at times. There were no major scares, but the suspense was really fantastic. The acting was a bit unbalanced - both mother and daughter did a solid job, but the shooting team (Michelle Ang and Jeremy DeCarlos in particular) weren't as good, no offense.The story turns out to be creepy enough and the ending does have one powerful scene (unfortunately that image is all over the internet by now).

77,numberone_1,Effective combination of documentary setting and supernatural thriller,9,22 April 2020,"I have to state my biases up front that (a) I really enjoy the ""found footage"" genre and (b) I was a long-standing fan of ""All My Children"" and have always enjoyed seeing actors from that show in other roles and other projects. That said, I found this film to be incredible. There is a seemingly normal / natural start to the film (a graduate student documenting a lady with early- to mid-stage Alzheimer's Disease), but the descent from ""natural"" to ""preternatural"" to ""supernatural"" occurs relatively quickly with building taut suspense and effective jump scares throughout. The use of the camera is highly effective in pinpointing the characters' experiences unfolding at the same time as for the viewers, including precise and accompanying dialogue that to me would be very likely in such situations (e.g., trying to challenge / justify how they could be witnessing inexplicable events, how certain things ""just aren't possible""). Jill Larson is absolutely outstanding in this unique leading role; Anne Ramsey is also outstanding, and her Sarah Logan character needs to be recorded as one of the best examples of a courageous antihero. Despite a couple of weak plot points (e.g., how we meet the sheriff, and the departure of one of the crew members), to me the film was well done, highly effective, and would likely be enjoyed by those who also like the ""found-footage"" genre.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

However, as seems too often case, instead of lending this movie any extra appeal, it actually turns out to be the movie's biggest failure. And make no mistake, this is probably a movie which otherwise could have been a big success in terms of scariness. Instead, at those moments between when it is successfully horrifying, it usually just comes across as cheesy, cliché and ultimately ruined. Notwithstanding, this is not, by a wide margin, the worst horror movie of 2014. However, it is not a particularly effective example of horror, and not nearly as effective as it could have been if done in a different way.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
80,FilmsFillMyHoles,Though it's not a good film at least it's pretty entertaining:,4,9 September 2017,"After hearing the premise I had high hopes for this one: an old lady, Deborah Logan, is in the early stages of Alzheimer's and a bunch of medical students stay at her house with her and her daughter to document the disease. After the next couple of nights Deborah starts to act incredibly strange, especially at night and as her condition gets drastically worse and worse the crew starts to believe that she might have become possessed by a sinister spirit.That's a pretty great freaking concept.BUT! the film was a let down. It felt like three completely different horror movies jammed into one, each with a very distinct plot, story and horror elements. The first act I enjoyed quite a bit. It's the closest thing to the main plot. It felt like an above average psychological horror film. It's kinda creepy, the acting is pretty good and the atmosphere is captivating. It's not as subtle as it should have been, but it's the best part of the movie.MINOR SPOILERS:Then came the second act, which introduces a serial child murderer whose spirit possessed Deborah's body and made her act all sinister and psycho for some reason to complete some ritual to become immortal or whatever. This took all the mystery away from the beginning and made the movie far less interesting and kinda bad. The ending is even worse, it's a freaking schlock-fest. In the last five minutes it became flat-out ridiculous: in a scene the old lady's jaw somehow disconnects and she tries to swallow a little girl literally like a goddamn snake...Though THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM at least IT'S PRETTY ENTERTAINING and has decent acting.

It was very clever how they incorporated Alzheimer's disease into the story - well, they didn't ""incorporate"" it - the disease is the main story, but it was very clever how they made it into a horror movie - the disease is very scary in and of itself.I have to admit that the acting was a bit iffy, but it became negligible toward the middle of the movie due to the intensity of the story.

83,SushiStoner103,A New Fashion Found Footage Film With Old Fashion Horror Does It Work ???,7,6 January 2015,"The taking of Deborah Logan is a very typical found footage style horror movie with a fairly basic plot. There were numerous found footage films recently released and they are slowly gaining a negative reputation for themselves and sadly this film barely stands out. Although it contains a few disturbing elements that were quite unsettling, the shaky camera work threw me off. The progression of the story was rather smooth, a motivating orientation with an intriguing explanation of the sickness Alzheimer's which the film revolve around frequently as the protagonist suffers from this very sickness. The film picks up on this and gradually increases the scares and tension, the jump scares were predictable lazy and cheap, but the film's scare factor often worked best in silence but sadly the tension was released by yet another obvious up coming jump scare. And after the fifth time I told myself this film isn't going anywhere. The last 20 mins was creepy and effective which kept a little old fashioned horror movie elements to it. Although there were some disturbing imagery that still floats around my head at night, But again that was ruined because the very end was unnecessary and overall so was the movie. Found footage has been dead since the second instalment of the paranormal activity franchise. Hollywood time to get creative stop making found footage films !!!",The Taking of Deborah Logan
84,my_anywhere,I don't even know how to rate this.,6,18 February 2015,"Let me get one thing out first: this was not a great movie. It could be a good movie, but right now I'm such in shock that I don't know how I feel. I don't understand the reviews saying this movie is boring or slow. I felt like it had a very nice pace that kept the story rolling and my interest high.What I will say is that the biggest detriment to this movie is that it was willing to have its characters make stupid choices in order for the creepy, intense scenes to happen. People often don't turn on lights when they are readily available (or should be, maybe there were unspoken reasons why the lights weren't working?). When Deborah becomes violent and injures people, she is not kept under lock and key until they can figure out how to treat her, rather she is allowed to go home time and again so she can do the same things. And of course, people go into places alone when they shouldn't, and don't call for back up when they should.That being said, I have to hand it to the filmmakers for creating some of the most intense and effective scaring that I've seen in years. Not even just the finale (I'll get to that later) but intermittently. Not everything works, and not every scare is fresh or original, but quite a few of them hit the mark and had me at the edge of my seat.And finally the ending. I had read in other reviews that this was quite the doozy, and I have to admit I was in no way, shape, or form prepared. I don't want to over-hype it (although I can't imagine how), but that was something I could not have seen coming, and for the first time in my horror-loving life, I actually had to look away from the screen. The image is still burned in my mind.I can say that the ending almost made the whole thing worth it, but just for setting up the scary bits I can't rationalize all the stupidity the characters show. As a whole, I don't regret watching ""Taking"" but it definitely had its flaws.That ending though...",The Taking of Deborah Logan

They are not spectacular, but there are a few very very creepy films - Paranormal activity 1,2,3, REC (THE BEST of them all) and this scary horror flick.The story of the movie is kinda original, it's not your generic horror movie premise. It's about Alzheimers disease and what it does to you and your family and loved ones. That part of the movie was actually pretty good. The two main actresses playing Deborah and Sarah Logan are very good and I felt their despair and pain going through it all. The film crew was bad, I didn't like any of them at all. The main girl was just screaming all the ime and acting very unnaturaly given the situations they were into.The second part of the movie was very creepy and disturbing for me. A lot of the reviewers here don't like it, because it was ""too supernatural"" - wait, what?
So, Deborah had some very disturbing scenes, the tone was dark and the terror was real. The final scene with Deborah and the girl will stay with me forever. That was one of the most disturbing images in a horror movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a whole lot. I have e feeling I will never forget it, so well done. The ending was kinda stupid, we could have lived without that, just the generic horror movie ending.Consider this - this film was made with only 1 milion dollars, almsot with no budget and for it's money it was just great.

Of course, things take a sinister turn as the crew cataloging the disease's progression begin to see and hear unexplainable phenomena.The first half of the film is genuinely terrifying, and had me in suspense.It is the film's second half, which I will not divulge here, that was a bit of a letdown. I really wanted to give the film a higher score, but I couldn't come up with more than a 6. All I will say is this: A horror film with a unique premise and a lot of promise gradually works its way back into the clichés of jump-scare Hollywood.However, I would be remiss if I did not commend the film for its portrayal of three major female characters (who really carry the film)--a Ph.

On the contrary, the taking of Deborah Logan is one of the most scary and best horror movies I have seen in years, easily at par with Rec, which I consider another gem of the last 20 years.It's in the found-footage genre, but as opposed to many other horrors it does not use cheap thrills and the same endless clichés of horror movies, which strongly benefits the narrative and the tense nature of the movie. Instead of, for example, relying on children that are scary or demonic appearances, this movie relies on an ultra-realistic atmosphere (including normal surroundings, police, hospital, everybody being a witness of somebody scary happening instead of only the protagonist etc etc) and an intelligent scenario about a women of about 50-60 years old that is quickly loosing her mind due to Alzheimer. The acting of both female protagonists (the Alzheimer mother and her daughter) is superb and very convincing. The lack of cheap thrills actually enhances this movie but simultaneously strays away from the boring extended build-ups with nothing really happening that is so common in modern-day horror cinema (for example: House of the Devil, the Witch etc.). It is thus an action-packed but not extremely fast movie with superb acting and some horrifying scenes.

100,jim_baclagon,The title character truly takes the movie higher,7,11 December 2014,"This could of been your normal creepy Possession movie... and in some ways it is. But this film is truly disturbing on a physiological level of a loved one going completely insane and having no control over his/her body. I've seen the exorcist, never found it scary. But this movie is creepy! And all thanks to the lead Actress who played Debrah. She just had her 110% in it! Giving the role a Realism and scare-factor that would've been dull and dumb and made this movie have a lower-rating. I was interested and fascinated at how her transformation would go. What was it? The other portions of the movie- such as the sound design, the setting and omg the ENDING- is potential nightmare fuel. And I watch plenty of horror films, it was just an amazing ending for such a spooky build-up. The pseudo-documentary parts where kind of, meh, but gladly it faded away. I loved the ""documentary""/ ""found footage"" element- even though it has been done to death, this movie seems to hit it on the mark. It's a great watch. But something amazing? Not really.

It was made by Hollywood Professionals with some recognizable actors. The movie's mystery is revealed a bit at a time adding to the suspense. The pacing starts at a normal pace and builds until the end. Of course that is what movies are supposed to do. But so many people think they can make a Found Footage film cause it is shot in video know nothing of how to make a movie.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERWhile this is the 3rd ""found footage"" I have see where the heroes survive. It is the 2nd one in a few months that has directors, writers and producers who are talented.The Sacrament was a bad movie, and while the ""heroes survived"" they only did because of coincidence rather than their own wits and actions.The Taking and As Above So Below were suspenseful, thrillers, and Scary except horror movies don't scare me anymore. Where the heroes find themselves in a terrible situation, try to fight, look for solutions and have suspenseful endings where some people survive. Found Footage is a good name for the genre, but it does not mean that everyone has to die and someone else finds the footage.Happy endings or everyone die endings can both be labeled Found Footage.One watches and doesn't automatically know how things will turn out.Unless it's one of the movies made by pretentious amateurs who don't have a clue.It's nice to see real money spent on these films. I hope this trend continues. I thought Blair Witch was a bore, but I guess it sort of inspired years later the Paranormal Activity Franchise which has started to have the same endings.

The Taking of Deborah Logan was a movie that had a slow beginning, but then kicked in not long after the story started rolling on. The movie had a never-ending amount of rolling scare effects that contained a great plot and storyline that went well with the greatly performed graphics and imagery of the movie. What made the movie even more unsettling was the music that went along with it. The dark tones that came along with the story and plot brought out the heart racing feeling of being actually scared by something that seems so far away.

It starts off with an atypical found footage intro: college students doing a thesis, they want to record it, you know the rest. They choose an elderly woman with early onset alzheimers disease, and things take a turn for the worse very quickly. The first half was a very well-built setup, with good atmosphere, excellent acting and simple yet effective horror movie tropes. The second half, however, fails in its attempts at keeping the terror and tension high. Poor character judgement, loud bangs unconnected with whats going on to maximize jump scares, long bouts of nothing happening lead to more eye rolling and boredom than actual scares, and a cliffhanger that was very much not needed.

Come on, the guy could push her away with ease.At least in the exorcist of Emily Rose one starts thinking and doing research on how it all happened to be. Was she really possessed or was she mentally ill?In the taking 2014 you start to believe that you are dealing with a mental illness until the show turn into a cliched zombified case of possession that everything turns back to normal when you set the bones of the guy who's possessed the creepy old woman on fire.I don't know.If you want to see how a proper movie that deals with mental issues is made watch The Exorcism of Emily Rose.

The hand-taken footage drives the film well and the suspense is building up nicely during the film. The explanations given about the events in the film are leaning toward the supernatural, but it all fits in nicely and gives a credible story. All plot twists are explained in a satisfactory way and for the first three quarters of the movie it speeds along nicely. However during the end it gets to be a bit too rich for my liking. I can go with the possession of an evil spirit and all that entails, but a human being trying to swallow a decent size kid with its mouth, nah, that just sort of didn't do it for me.

I like about half of the ones I see, and the other half I don't like for the same reason I didn't really love this film: The shaky camera for this movie in particular did the opposite of feeling real, as a ""found footage"" film is supposed to. Something just felt overtly off. ""The Taking"" felt like an interesting premise in the beginning duration of its story. The whole Alzheimer's deal was actually the most disturbing aspect for me; something so real that was visually portrayed made me genuinely disturbed and saddened. It was around the time that all the funky supernatural stuff came into play - That's when I started becoming confused and distracted, and the film no longer had the potential to really be scary for me anymore. I think that they honestly could've used the Alzheimer's without such weird supernatural elements in addition. Basically, it just felt unnecessary, and left something to be desired.

The feel and events flow and if there's any continuity errors (which are profound in this genre) they are hard to notice.The ending shows some fantastic CGI for this film, and it gives you the creeps even after you finish.The only reason it's not 10/10 is because of the typical characters and their standard typings.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

135,King_Kestrel,Creepy Done Right,7,27 October 2014,"If The Taking of Deborah Logan was just about a sufferer of Alzheimer's disease, it would be scary enough. The illness robs its victims of their minds, and in turn, their humanity. The Taking's plot walks a dangerous line in how sensitively it treats its subject matter, but the experience outside of its horror-premise is authentic enough.I watched my grandmother deteriorate from Alzheimer's when I was quite young, but certain events still stand out vibrantly in my memory. I recall her talking to herself in the mirror, late at night, unable to realize that it was a one-way conversation. At times, she was coherent and alert. As the disease progressed, these periods of awareness dwindled. My mother was an emotional wreck. She had now lost two parents to mentally-debilitating illnesses. I can see shades of her experience in the fantastic performance by Anne Ramsay, Deb Logan's daughter. Ramsay has naturally sorrowful eyes, but she exudes more than sadness. She's frustrated; tired of trying to make sense of it all; weary of her mother's inexplicable behavior. She's steeled herself emotionally against the slow, inevitable, and bitter end she knows is just around the corner. Throughout the film she struggles with losing a mother who's already gone but not yet dead.Jill Larson's performance was gut wrenching in its authenticity. We imagine ourselves as Alzheimer's victims, frightened of what we've become; of what we've lost. But that's just not how it works. Deb Logan isn't frightened, because she's only aware of what she's doing while she's in the driver's seat. When an early-to-mid stage Alzheimer's patient lapses into one of their spells, who's in the driver's seat then?The Taking's answer is, of course, much more horrific than in reality. It's a horror movie, by the numbers, by the book. Sure, the scares are well-crafted, and there are 30% less annoying jump scares than normal. But when you get down to it, the movie has the same skeleton that most run-of-the-mill horror movies have. What sets The Taking apart from the others is its humanity. Sarah Logan loves her mother and tries desperately to help her however she can. She doesn't understand what's happening but she's damn well going to fight it anyway. This isn't a ""love conquers all"" story, but love sure makes a valiant effort. The movie is not without its flaws. It overplays various horror staples like creepy kids or people walking slowly up to a possessed person who's facing a wall. Dude, they're gonna turn around and scream at you or something. Mia Medina's camera crew makes a believable enough vehicle for the ""found footage"" style the movie's going after, but she doesn't actually have much to do once the plot gets going. Police seem oddly unable to stand in the way of a middle-aged woman, a girl in her 20s, or a camera man. Attics and basements are still bad places to go.Overall though, Where most horror movies feature characters that couldn't die fast enough, The Taking succeeds because its principle characters are believable, and we actually care about them. That, and I find it eerie that you could cut 5-10 minutes out of the movie - all the expressly supernatural parts - and what's left could easily be a true story.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

Some of the reviews that score this movie low must not have known that they were going to be watching a supernatural horror, because they immediately start complaining about how it ""turned"" supernatural. I feel like they weren't picking up on any of the clues that were offered early in the film that suggested this. The performances of the cast were great and as a medical professional, the actress that plays Deborah should be praised for her performance of a dementia patient! Also the actress that plays the daughter does a stellar job of a person with care giver role strain.
I enjoy that the story takes its time to give some character development and I don't think that it is exploitative of The Alzheimer disease process. It shows how rapid the progression can be, and then it is exacerbated by a spirit possession!

Alzheimer's is a horrible disease which in itself must be terrifying to both witness and suffer, and it's side effects make for a great catalyst for a movie such as this. In fact, I would go as far to say a mind altering disease having this effect on a person is far scarier than some form of paranormal entity behind the steering wheel. It earned my curiosity. I was impressed that for once a found footage hand held camera style movie wasn't solely relying on jump scares and was using other themes to create tension. And then.... Around half way through a well expected shift in tone. The paranormal elements take over. That's what we signed up right? Unfortunately this is when it all slowly sinks into the stinking pit of found footage cliches, relying On jump scares left right and centre, sequences that consist of unwatchable camera work and over the top chaos. Everything that makes the first half fantastic; the mother and daughter dinamic, the good acting, the themes involving the illness all dissapear, and what you are left with is a movie that you feel like you have seen a hundred times before. It's hard for me to say stay away from this movie because it does have many good qualities, and if you're a big fan of this genre then it is probably one of the more watchable ones, the first half I would say maybe one of the better I have seen.

Instead of scared you left me annoyed. There are plenty of moments like this. Like when Sarah, the daughter, runs in for the body in the sack after a fire just blasted her to the ground, and then goes driving around with it, and carrying it. Just stupid. This film also plays off the same fright, over and over again. Deborah goes missing during the night. Everyone runs around frantically for her. They find her. Repeat the next night. COMMIT her or something. If she is that sick and progressed, then she should not be living at home, especially without an RN to supervise her. But for the sake of the film, I get it.. however, this just added to the unbelievable plot.

Her behavior is getting worse really fast, but it seems something else is going on with her, something evil...Jill Larson is the best actress in the movie. She really nails her character. Anne Ramsay follows, then the rest of the acting is okay I guess.Now, the problem with this movie is mainly about rational behavior of the characters. You know, when you are looking for someone confused in the house, it works better with the lights on. But here noooo, that wouldn't be scary enough. The group could also make sure to tell her they are coming and are looking for her, but it feels like they are almost hiding from her. Then when we find the lost lady or something scary, we also get a bonus unrelated scary sound, to make sure the jump scares are effective. Some scenes can get pretty exciting sometimes, but don't hope to find anything extraordinary with this movie, you'd be disappointed.

The acting is OK I guess but i didn't feel anything for any of the actors. I give this 3/10 purely because of how slow it is.,The Taking of Deborah Logan
143,AshmoreFilm,A Regurgitated Formula. Predictable and Adolescent.,2,6 February 2016,"This movie was a total disaster. The performances were Beyond melodramatic. The plot was totally predictable and the characterizations (especially that of the big scary dead French serial killer/serpent) were entirely infantile. If horror fans on Rotten Tomatos are giving this 5 stars ... And IMDb gave it 6/10 ... Then horror fans must be extremely hungry for something worthwhile. Another typical Point of View Camera film for shock value. No true cinematic girth at all.The Taking of Deborah Logan is a 2014 American horror film and the feature film directorial debut of Adam Robitel, written by Robitel and co-writer Gavin Heffernan. The film stars Jill Larson, Anne Ramsay, and Michelle Ang.[1] Set in Virginia, it tells the story of a documentary crew making a film about Alzheimer's patients who uncover something sinister while documenting a woman who suffers from the disease.[2] The film was produced by Jeff Rice and Bryan Singer and was released on October 21, 2014.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
144,ilvminatvs,An small occult movie masterpiece !,7,7 July 2015,"The movie is somewhat amateurish for the budget,one could say. It is a B- Movie one could say. But if you are a fan of 70's occult movies this one's for you. You already read about the plot being given, but this surely does not explain the meaning of the movie at all. The Alzheimer ""victim"" is no victim at all, because she is fully aware the whole time what is happening to her. She, and her old buddy are evil creatures of the 1st grade, making sure the she will live forever in a new body of a little child. The final 3rd of the movie explains it all. Yes, the movie has its flaws, but hey: what movie of the 21st century is flawless? Well, in my opinion none. The old masters won't be reached by todays filmmakers, because they have too much possibilities to do things in movies, what in earlier times was not possible, so they sought after a good story, and a good camera, actors grow with their turns. A good 7 out of 10.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
145,kyogre123,Frustrated Because This Had Potential,5,23 December 2014,"I like the way the movie started. I liked the premise and the ""horror"" movie take on something as real as someone slowly suffering from Alzheimer's.But they lost me once all the supernatural stuff started.And I could have tolerated the supernatural stuff if that's the way they wanted to go with this, but I couldn't because of that stupid shaky cam and that girl doing the documentary (I forgot her name, May?) screaming all the time. Sucks because I started watching this with very high expectations (since I heard it was a pretty good movie) but it didn't deliver. And that sucks, because based on the first 20-30 minutes, it had potential.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

I don't know what all in these reviews were watching all these decades but i have watched every single good movie in the genre and beyond and i can say it's Top 3 worst I've seen so far.I will keep it simple and short explaining why.The plot is unreal bad, the whole story about the visitors, their goal and the whole ,,horror'' journey is more like a funny school short movie then like an actual film.The acting skills are tragedy, almost as bas as the plot and the ending.The information about the ,,taking"" and the rituals and is misleading and childish.If i could give a 0/10 i would.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

151,oceaneyes-98341,SPECTACULAR MOVIE!,10,18 November 2020,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I felt like I was in a magical wonderland with Deborah. They gave her a lot of character development throughout the movie. Also, I LOVEEEEE that there was LGBTQ+ representation in the movie. I love that each character played a major role in the movie. The ending was amazing. I throughly enjoyed when they used special effects to make Deborah's mouth hang wide. I really was surprised when everything happened. I feel like I have such a strong emotional bond to each and every character in this movie. I love the amount of love each character has for each other. The characters seem to love each other like a family :). Deborah made me feel happy and warm inside. It is inexpressible how much I love Deborah. Deb is very attractive and amazing. I hope the students got wonderful footage for their assignment in class. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIEEEEEEEEE. THIS MOVIE HAS CHANGED ME AS A PERSON- MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY, BY PHYSICALLY I MEAN, I LOOK LIKE DEBORAH LOGAN NOW. I AM NOT MAD, SHE IS HOT.",The Taking of Deborah Logan

153,dreamcatcherxx,Excellent insight into Alzheimer's but with a twist!,8,24 March 2015,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie to start off with as it look very low budget and didn't have much of a blur, but don't judge a movie by it's cover because this movie actually surprised me! I like to think of myself as a bit of a horror buff and I'm always intrigued to find a horror that makes me scared to walk in the dark, well The Taking definitely did that! The story line was interesting and the movie didn't bore me to end up playing a game on my phone! The acting was believable and didn't make me cringe. Anne Ramsay's character has had a tough experience watching her mother deteriorate away and you really believe it by watching her acting! I recommend giving this movie a shot!",The Taking of Deborah Logan
154,Soundchaser2013,Horror Sleeper is a Unknown Gem,8,25 October 2014,"This little gem scores big on the creep factor and for the overall suspense throughout the film. Kudos goes out to director Adam Robitel...I'll be keeping you under my proverbial radar for your future endeavors. Jill Larson's portrayal of Deborah is top notch, she's an ""Thespian Extraordinaire"". The rest of the cast also did an excellent job of supporting the main character. After viewing,(late night and no lights), I resorted to switching on ESPN Sportscenter for some much needed detox and a cup of tea before retiring for the night, even then, it was a restless night's sleep. Do yourself a big favor and watch this movie with knowing very little about it...best not to read any further reviews, especially ones that critique the storyline.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
155,washburn9343,Best scary movie ever!,10,16 October 2017,"Wow I found this little gem by accident and was greatly rewarded. I've never been fond of found-footage but I make the exception with this one. Seriously, it creeped me out so bad I had to have a ""chaser"" movie afterward and still didn't sleep that night. I promise it's a movie you won't ever forget.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
156,j-przewoznik,Terrific Horror Gem,8,30 October 2014,"""A documentary on Alzheimer's takes a supernatural twist...""I will readily admit that I felt I was taking a gamble when first starting the Taking of Deborah Logan. So many of these genre films appear around this time of year (October) that I've almost come to expect them to serve as cheap cash ins on the holiday itself. I've watched countless disappointments and plenty of rehashed, predictable plots. Thankfully, Deborah Logan was not one of these instances.The movie was amazing. And while I cannot say every cast member gave an incredible performance, none of them detracted from my enjoyment of the film. Jill Larson who portrays the title character was particularly impressive, and instilled the film with a constant tension. The plot moved along steadily. There were no moments where I found myself bored. I was quite literally on the edge of my seat. Suspense and atmosphere play very important parts throughout the film, and the team behind this movie certainly did a great job ensuring that everything, from the visuals to the sound effects, was of quality.I cannot recommend Deborah Logan enough. It is the perfect film for this Halloween, and one that will certainly stick with every viewer for some time afterwards. Equally important, any fan of horror must watch this film. If you're on the fence, take the gamble. Not only will you not be disappointed, but the final scenes of this movie involving Deborah Logan will stick out in your mind as some of the most powerful, eerie images to come from the genre in quite some time.8/10.The writers & director of this movie will certainly be names to watch for in the future.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
157,sussexmultisports-info,Looking for a creepy movie this Halloween with plenty of scares?,10,29 October 2014,If yes then The Taking of Deborah Logan is for you! Loved every minute of the movie. It slowly builds up to a tense finale and unlike most horrors the ending for me was perfect. It has a mixture of The Last Exorcism and Paranornal Activity with great performances from all the cast! It had me and my partner on the edge of our seat throughout. What I like most about the movie is how you can create great atmosphere on a shoe string budget. All the big scares are done without over the top CGI. Any horror fans out there will love this as it has everything you need. Will be keeping a look out for this director in the near future. 10 out of 10 for me and a movie I will be a watching again!,The Taking of Deborah Logan
158,vcwelch,"If the Conjuring and the Exorcist had a baby,,,this is it",8,22 October 2014,"""White people and their basements and f--king attics"" I don't know how this missed being released nationwide to the masses. The storyline was awesome and the scares made me jump and check the dark room I was in to see if something was there. It starts out innocent with a mother who may have the beginnings of alzheimers and a very butch like daughter who invites a camera crew to document the mother for a project because they need the money to keep their house and then it begins. I haven't jumped or screamed like a little girl in awhile..loved it. All I can say is I don't like snakes and after this movie I still don't. This had it all for me the jumps, the creepy noises, creepy old ladies and after it was over I had to turn the lights on in my room because I was a little bit shaken. It was kinda like the Blair Witch at the end but better in that you actually saw what was happening..creepy.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
159,cenotaphe,Disappointing,3,22 October 2014,"I had such hope for this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. A silly premise (a doctoral student paying their subject enough money to ""save their home""!?!?), an increasingly illogical plot, and HORRID acting (including screaming and yelling ad nauseam, and characters talking over each other so you can't understand half of the dialog) ruined what could have been a decent film.And then there is the requisite shaky camera work that, in my opinion, was used to cover up that fact that there was very little actually going on. By the end of the movie, I was convinced that ANYONE can make a movie at this stage of the game.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
160,sashabear1,Great scary movie that feels real at times,8,28 December 2014,"Although it's a lower budget movie the hand filming gives it great authentic feel and allows you to feel as if it could be real. Best use of this type of filming I've seen. The acting is superb and Jill Larson is mesmerizing. Such a nice twist on cookie cutter scare films and tactics. Loved the use of darkness and the realistic comments from actors who reply the way normal (non scripted) people probably would if faced with such fear. When the one technician leaves after having had enough of the craziness, his comments are amusing but, hey, realistic! Also the use of subtitles is great, not only because audio is realistically hard to hear, but it satisfies the viewers need to really understand what is happening. Applause. Well done!",The Taking of Deborah Logan
161,thanosnic,Disappointing at best.,3,25 November 2018,"This movie has a great premise, it's a really fresh take on the genre. What I don't understand however is why it was shot this way.Now, I am not really a found footage kind of guy but still the director managed to annoy me with the cinematography. The lighting is bad, even for a supposed documentary which would understandably not be well lit. Also, the fact that throughout the entirety of the movie the camera keeps cutting is just adding insult to injury, not to mention how much it ruins the pacing of most scenesThis could have been a great horror story but the sub par writing and all the technical issues seriously ruined my immersion.",The Taking of Deborah Logan
162,bayardolopez-97519,A lot better than I thought it'd be!,9,16 May 2015,"So I have to say I created an account just to rate this movie. I've seen a lot of horror movies and I like the more mainstream, big ones but this one didn't disappoint. It's different than other found footage cameras with a twist and it works great. A pet peeve of mine is when a character is eavesdropping and you can't even hear the conversation they're listening to. Here, they add subtitles so that you can read what they're saying. It's a small detail but it makes a world of a difference. I caught myself with my jaw dropped a couple of times during the movie and some scenes get very intense. One of the biggest pros of this film is that you never really know what to expect next unlike other movies where everything is extremely predictable. I would recommend this film without a doubt to anyone looking to watch something creepy that will keep you on edge when you're trying to go to sleep late at night!",The Taking of Deborah Logan

Made with a handheld video camera and to make matters worse, using only the light from the camera or nothing more than flashlight... First part of the movie is a fake attempt to make a documentary about Alzheimer disease which is so bad nothing builds for a plot to the movie.. Second half so stupid, no plot, no theme, nothing is built upon.. So, very difficult to understand, when, why, how? Is there a demon inside her, maybe a poltergeist or just what... And still using flashlights for lighting.. And the ending... Nothing some 10 years later.. Birthday party for some little girl... One of the worst movies I've ever seen.. How this movie is getting 6.0 ratings I don't know... B-Movie and solid 1 Star..",The Taking of Deborah Logan
