0,SnoopyStyle,marriage of style and substance,9,26 October 2020,"It's 1939. Franz Jägerstätter is a peaceful Austrian farmer and devout Catholic in the mountain village of St. Radegund. He and his beloved wife Fani have three young daughters. Austrians are supposed to take the Hitler oath but he refuses. In 1943, he is finally forced into active duty. As a conscientious objector, he continues to reject the Hitler oath and is arrested.Terrence Malick has made many beautiful looking films but sometimes his ethereal subject matters get beyond me. More recently, his movies fall apart into lovely nothingness. That's not the case here. This is about suffering and resolve. It marries perfectly with long, slow, uninterrupted takes. The beauty of Malick's visuals only accentuates the inner beauty of the idea. The two work hand-in-hand in elevating this movie. I do have one issue when his mother apologizes to his wife. There's no need for the words. Sometimes, the actual words deflate the intention. I would just cut out that line. I would also do the standard movie trope of showing the present day connection. I would insert a picture of his grave or his decedents or his Beatification. It may be too cheap for Malick but I would still do it for the man's legacy.",A Hidden Life
1,Kirpianuscus,great,10,22 February 2020,"You feel than it is a film by Terrence Malick. And, knowing before the first scenes the story of Franz Jagestatter you have the certitude than nobody except him can give, in fair manner, the story of the Austrian blessed. Sure, the image and the storytelling and the perfect cast. But more. A sort of thrill about a delicate theme not so easy to present in right way. And a great film about conscience against dictatorship. The source of force -,off course, is the image but, more important, the status of contemporary story. It represents a form of warning. Clear and high precise send to us.",A Hidden Life
2,Horst_In_Translation,"The usual Malick, pretty good most of the time",6,8 February 2020,"""A Hidden Life"" is a New American/German co-production that premiered in 2019 and now also made its way to German theaters. The writer and director is Terrence Malick, which may at least partially explain the fact that this movie is almost three hours long. For other filmmakers, it could be an exception to come up with a film of such a long running time, but for Malick it is nothing too extraordinary. The more unusual aspect here is the cast list. The big majority are German actors, which is only accurate as the film plays in Germany, but still. I mean Taika Waititi just made a film that takes place during the same time like this one here and is also set in Germany with virtually no German actors. Maybe because Malick got them all? Most of the film takes place in Austria, but there are also key sequences set in (my city) Berlin.It should surprise nobody really that, if a renowned filmmaker like Malick makes a film with German/Austrian actors, then the very best are eager to join. So for a German film buff like myself, it was easy to recognize many cast members here: August Diehl plays the main character and I like him a lot, so I am really fond of the decision to pick him here. Franz Rogowski is always easy to recognize, not just because of his speech impediment. Austria's most finest include Karl Markovics (at the other side now compared to his Oscar-winning ""Die Fälscher""), Tobias Moretti and Johannes Krisch. All three have amazing recognition value and it is particularly interesting to me to see Markovics and Moretti in here, even if they do not have any scenes together, because they really launched their careers together 25 years ago and what we have here is a bit of a Kommissar Rex reunion, even if the subject (and quality) is considerably more meaningful. Alexander Fehling is also always easy to recognize and even those that I did not recognize immediately are really famous here in Germany. This includes Rois, Wuttke, Matthes and Schoenaerts. Most of them do not have a lot of screen time. And then there are Michael Nyqvist and Bruno Ganz. The former died 2.5 years ago already sadly, so I am really surprised to see him still in here. This is his last acting credit. As for Bruno Ganz, he died a year ago, which still makes me sad because I really adore him to this day and I am grateful for the body of work he left us. In this film here, he is also not in it for too long, but makes a memorable impact playing a judge at a Nazi court. You can easily see that he sympathizes with the accused, but one person cannot go against the judicial system from back then and so there could only be one decision by the court obviously. The moment when Ganz' character sits down in the chair of the accused is really telling and one of the smartest inclusions this film has to offer. And looking at how long it goes and how many smart inclusions there are, this means quite something.Most of the time, it is Diehl sharing the screen with one other character and that is a good approach because most other characters do only have two scenes max, so we still find out a lot about them nonetheless thanks to good focus. By the way, I said earlier that Markovics changed sides if we compare this film to another, but the same is also very true when it comes to Diehl, if you remember his brief, but memorable, turn in Tarantino's elaboration on the years of World War II. That film by the way also has Brühl and Waltz, the two big name German/Austrian actors you won't find in here. But other than that, it is really an elite cast. I think that this film is really typical Malick and with this, I am not just referring to the fast camera movements and the camera being so close to people's faces, but also that somehow this approach indoors feels always a bit odd. And I also mean with that that we get the usual voice-over parts on many many occasions and the difference to voice-overs by other filmmakers is mostly that Malick uses them while we see the character at the same time. So we basically hear his thoughts. He made nice use of the idea here that these voice-overs are in the form of a letter sent by the male protagonist to his wife back in Austria. It is also a really slow movie, but this should not come as a surprise to anybody who has seen something else from Malick. It is always more about the beauty (or ugliness) of certain situations than about one big plot twist happening after the next when it comes to Malick's movies.So a big part here is Diehl's struggles with the Nazis, be it the ones coming to his village and ask for a donation or be it only the ones who use the famous salutation from back then. The second half then is much more about his struggles when he is in jail. He is forced to join the military, but does not agree to swear on the Fuehrer because he despises him and sees him as evil. The consequence is that he has to go to jail. There he has to go through all kinds of humiliations, emotional and physical, and we become a witness of these. Still, Malick is a filmmaker who does not depict violence that much in his films and this one here is as non-violent as it can be. The one scene when he is really brutally beaten we see through the main character's eyes and the consequence is that we do not see any blood or so, so it even applies to this scene. And of course, we don't see the act of Diehl's character being murdered. By the way, early on it says that this film is based on real characters, so this implied there will probably not be a happy ending because his story would not have become famous if he had lived. Ganz' character's words that nobody will ever know about his story were wrong. We do now. Eventually, it would have been really unrealistic for him to survive and the description of the executioner by Rogowski's character is a great example of foreshadowing.Meanwhile, when the film is not with Diehl's character, but with the female protagonist (his wife), we see how she is bullied by the townsfolk because of her (and her husband's) anti-Hitler approach that really was not appreciated at all back then. And so are the three daughters. The female protagonist has her sister around and the two basically have to run the farm completely on their own without help from anybody in the village. There are exceptions though: We see one elderly woman helping the female protagonist on one occasion and there are other characters, who are not completely fond of Hitler and offer support, but these are the tiny minority, probably also because they were scared themselves that they could end up being prosecuted. And prosecution basically equaled death back then. Fehling's character is a good example. The way how he tried to convince the protagonist to save his own life by getting him to accept a medical job was something that could cost him his career, if not more, is what he says on one occasion. However, there is no such way for Diehl's character because for this profession he would also have to swear an oath on Hitler and he is not willing to do that under any circumstance. The last anchor is when his wife and a local priest (Moretti, who supported her as we see when he wants the other children to play with their children) manage to find the central character and try to convince him to save his life. But it is especially his wife who realizes quickly that he made up his mind and actually, it turns out that he instead is convincing her that he is doing the right thing and she understands it and there is one last kiss between them before the guards step in and separate them for good. This, at the latest, was when it all became clear that there would be no way for the main character to survive.The theater was packed in my showing, no surprise because the movie is really new here and it's the weekend, but you could really feel how everybody was touched by this film and the woman in the row in front of me sometimes had to look away, for example in this sequence when Diehl's character is beaten up. Many cried, too. It is a really touching and emotional movie and overall, I think the outcome is good enough for a positive recommendation. However, it is Malick and I am sure the running time as well as the style (typical criticism: not too much happens) are certainly not for everybody. So it may be a good idea to see other older works from this filmmaker before you decide to check this one out. Basically, you don't really need my recommendation. I myself am not a big Malick fan, but this one here I liked more than previous works from him, probably because this historic era has always caught my interest and because I am a big fan of Diehl.I am a bit surprised this movie has basically not received any awards recognition at all in Hollywood, which is quite a pity, but probably the reason is where it is set. It is simply not an American movie from any perspective, even if it is an American co-production. Or I don't know, maybe it is also available for awards season 2020/2021 in North America. In any case, glad to see it got some recognition elsewhere, most of all at the Cannes Film Festival. I believe that, with this effort here, Malick showed us that he still got it and I am glad that apparently audiences and critics alike give this one a thumbs-up. I shall join them. The filmmaker has still a lot to tell despite how prolific he has been in recent years, while before that he often had really long gaps between his films. I am pretty certain there is a lot more I could say about this one and for example elaborate on how religion and philosophy are always factors in Malick's films and this one here is not an exception, not only because there is a priest in it, but most of all how the main character tries to cope with evil taking over his world when his mind is all kind-spirited. The innocence of life in the Austrian mountains (really beautiful to watch by the way) clashing with the dark political clouds is another major factor. Watch for yourself.",A Hidden Life
3,Quinoa1984,An imperfect masterpiece of free will and a spiritual existence,9,30 December 2019,"As it turns out, if Terrence Malick is working from at least some semblance of a script or firm story, he can do some pretty good things!A Hidden Life is an intimate, spiritual epic that can mostly stand alongside Scorsese's Silence as far as films from this decade that are somewhat punishing but immensely rewarding for the (dont laugh) fulfillment they do for one's soul and sense of what our place is in a world that has beliefs and allegiances. This is as mesmerizing as anything Malick has ever directed, and when the poetry of it all clicks it's him firing on all of his cylinders, and in this case it is about a person's moral position and (see if this sounds is familiar) not pledging allegiance to tyranny and oppression, while at the same time connecting it to how one's mind connects to memory and to the natural world.The one downside, at least on a first viewing, is that it runs too long, and there needed to be an editor or two with more gumption to say that just five or ten minutes could be lost (like, we get it after the first ten minutes of prison suffering, do we need ten more?) All this said, it packs a wallop on equal intellectual and emotional ground, and while I may criticize the length I can't overlook how stunning many of the transitions and match cuts do their work to create connections and bonds between this man and wife and with the mountains and water and sea. More often than not this touches one as a lyrical and as a dark existential fable, with a commanding performance from August Diehl at its center.Frankly, I think this film should be made more available than Disney - nay Fox Searcglight - has been doing, whether by their lack of support or lack of ""bankable"" talent. Id even go as far as to say if it was there in more rural parts of the U.S., where some young or even older person might wander in and be affected by the themes of standing up to the worst in humanity (even if, especially if, it may cost all).",A Hidden Life
4,evanston_dad,Accessible Malick,7,10 January 2020,"Those who have been scared away in the past by some of Terence Malick's head scratchers rest assured: this movie is more ""The Thin Red Line"" than it is ""The Tree of Life.""That's not to say, however, that it doesn't have Malick's fingerprints all over it. Continuous monotone voice over narration, long scenes of seemingly nothing happening, lots of shots of the natural world and the theme of man's relationship to it. It may sound like I'm rolling my eyes and being critical of Malick, but I'm not. I adored ""The Tree of Life,"" in fact much more than this movie. But I do admit that three hours of Malick at his most abstract can be a little much. Even here, in a film that's much more traditionally narrative and accessible, I felt the length and don't think it needed to be as long as it is.""A Hidden Life"" is based on the true story of an Austrian farmer who was drafted to join the Nazi regime in WWII but who refused to swear an oath to Hitler. As a result, he spent his entire military service in prison. The film in equal parts also shows what life for his left-behind wife and children was like back in their small rural village, where they were ostracized by the townspeople for disloyalty. The film's title comes from the last passage of George Eliot's fabulous novel ""Middlemarch,"" which is also shown on screen at the film's end. Do small individual acts of resistance even matter when one is up against the vast mechanism of governments and institutions? Are we better off just taking the path of least resistance and the one that will ensure the most comfortable lives for ourselves and our families when our ideals won't make any difference anyway? The fact that the movie is named after Eliot's novel is an indication where Malick himself lands on these questions, but the movie for the most part just asks them and doesn't try to answer them for its audience.""A Hidden Life"" is a solid film but not one that really stood out for me this year. It certainly didn't feel transporting like some of Malick's best movies have in the past.Grade: A-",A Hidden Life
5,ferguson-6,Malick on faith,8,19 December 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. With a title pulled from a line in George Eliot's ""Middlemarch"", enigmatic filmmaker Terrence Malick continues his deep probe into humanity and faith ... recurring themes in most of his films, and especially the run that began with his excellent THE TREE OF LIFE (2012). This current film is easily his most accessible over that period as it focuses on the (mostly) true story of Austrian WWII conscientious objector Franz Jagerstatter.The film opens with contrasting images: a black screen with sounds of nature fading to a bucolic Austrian Alps village versus dramatic historical clips of Hitler (I believe from Leni Reifenstahl's 1935 Nazi propaganda film TRIUMPH OF THE WILL). The rural farming village we see is Sankt Radegund, the idyllic community where Franz Jagerstatter (played by August Diehl, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS) lives off the land with his wife Franziska ""Fani"" (played by Valerie Pachner) and their three young daughters. It's a family bonded by love. The family and fellow villagers go about the rigors of daily life as the war spreads. In 1940, Franz is sent to Enns Military base for training, and is then returned to his village under a farming exemption.What follows is a first half filled with dread as Franz struggles with his own beliefs in a new world order that has no room for individual thought. He refuses to swear an oath to Hitler, despite the rest of the villagers doing so. He knows what this means, as does his wife. As Franz refuses the ""Heil Hitler"", he is described as being something worse than an enemy - a traitor. He holds firmly to his principles ... vague to us, yet crystal clear to him. He becomes a pariah in his own village, as even the priest urges him to relent by stating he has ""a duty to the fatherland.""""Don't they know evil when they see it?"" Franz asks the question we have all been asking since Hitler came to power. When he is called to duty in 1943, Franz and Fani know the eventual outcome. Franz is asked by many, and in various ways, ""What purpose does it serve?"" No one can make sense of his stand. As he is imprisoned at Tegel Prison, solicitors played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Alexander Fehling both try to convince him to pledge loyalty and save his life. Franz's response is, ""I can't do what I know is wrong.""With the first half being filled with dread and anxiety, the second half is all about the suffering. Franz is locked away with very little access to the nature or family he holds so dear, while Fani is a village outcast, trying desperately to raise their daughters and put food in their mouths. They are each in their own prison - isolated from the life they love. From Tegel Prison in 1943, Franz writes many letters to Fani. The letters are philosophy mixed with hope and love, and provide the source of how his story was discovered many years ago.Anyone familiar with Malick's films know that each is a visual work of artistry. Instead of his usual cinematographer, 3-time Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, this film features the camera work of Jorg Widmer (who assisted Lubezki on THE TREE OF LIFE). The film lives up to our expectations, especially in capturing the vitality and spirit of nature through lush landscapes, mountains, trees, grasses, gardens, streams, rivers, and a waterfall. The family is one with nature, which stands in stark contrast to Franz inside the cold prison walls. Composer James Newton Howard brilliantly uses a lone violin, as well as a mixture of classical music. This was the final film for two extraordinary actors who recently passed away. Michael Nyqvist plays the Bishop who tells Franz that if God gave us free will, then we are responsible for what we do and what we don't do. Bruno Ganz plays the head judge on the committee that decides Franz's fate.We could describe the film as either a tragic love story or an ode to faith and principles. Both fit, and yet both fall short. Terrence Malick is a confounding and brilliant and artistic filmmaker. After his breakthrough film DAYS OF HEAVEN (1978), he took a 20 year hiatus before filming THE THIN RED LINE (his other WWII film). Recently he has proven much more productive, yet he remains a meticulous craftsman - taking three years to edit this film. His visual style is quite unique, yet he has the skill to make a messenger's bicycle bell send chills. He was able to meet Franz's surviving daughters (now in their 80's) prior to filming, as they still live near this village. We are quite fortunate that this exquisite filmmaker is allowing us to tag along on his search for the meaning of life and his exploration of faith ... just make sure you set aside 3 hours for the lesson.",A Hidden Life
6,deloudelouvain,Too bad it's that long and slow.,6,6 March 2020,"A Hidden Life: The Austrian Franz Jägerstätter, a conscientious objector, refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War II. So far, so good, interesting material to make a good movie, which it was by the way, but that's if you have a lot of patience because the pace of this movie is extremely slow. It's three hours of melancholy, but beautifully filmed, because that's what makes this movie still worth a watch. The cinematography was on top, great camera work, nice unusual camera angles, stunning landscapes, all ingredients to make a brilliant movie. Unfortunatelly it's that long and slow, and that brings it down, even if the story is poignant and will make you think about moral values and priorities in life. The message is nice, nobody should have to do something against his will especially if it's evil. The fact that Franz Jägerstätter is a Godfearing human made him just another dumb human being to me. Not sure, well in fact I'm sure, that I didn't like his real motivation for his actions. I would do anything to be back with my family, lie through my teeth if I had to but certainly not abandon them like this. In short, A Hidden Life has a good story, but too long and too slow, with a good cast that did a very good job with their respective characters, and a nice cinematography. I would have scored it higher if it was 90 minutes long.",A Hidden Life
7,ksf-2,based on a true stoary,8,18 June 2021,"August Diehl is Franz Jägerstätter, an austrian. When hitler and the boys move in, the austrian citizens are required to fight for and with the nazi soldiers. But Jägerstätter says nein. After joining in early military training, he does manage to escape serving for germany for various accepted reasons. At first. Then, supply and demand and the need for more soldiers catches up with Jägerstätter. And being so outspoken doesn't help him either; he doesn't hide his contempt for what the germans are doing. Which was a huge no-no. Very well done. Much time spent showing us his idyllic life on the hills of austria. Written and directed by oscar nominated Terrence Malick. Based on true events. Some fun facts and information in the Trivia section here for this film, as well as in wikipedia. Hidden Life won TONS of film festival awards, and was nominated for many more. Didn't seem to get an oscar attention. Perhaps it didn't qualify? Or at almost three hours, maybe it was too long for theater audiences.",A Hidden Life
8,MOscarbradley,One of Malick's very best films.,9,8 December 2020,"You know that when Terrence Malick tackles the true-life story of an Austrian conscientious objector during World War Two it won't be like anyone else's true-life story and it certainly won't be a 'biopic'. In recent years Malick has been severely criticised for what many saw as pretentious doodlings in the world of music and show-business, as if what creativity he might have had had dried up and he was just making expensive, personal home-movies. Actually, I'm a big fan of both ""Knight of Cups"" and ""Song to Song"" even if I did find ""To the Wonder"" unendurable. Now Malick has made an anti-war film in a way that only Malick can; five minutes into ""A Hidden Life"" you know you are watching a Terrence Malick film. Diehard fans will, of course, love it while his detractors will be groaning in their seats and crying, 'Oh no, not another one'. Ten minutes in, however, and you can see that while all the Malick tropes are here, this could be a movie that harkens back to ""Days of Heaven"", if a 'war' movie, not quite as guttural as ""The Thin Red Line"" and again, in typical Malick fashion, voice-over or narrration seems to dominate much more than conversational dialogue.Visually it's extraordinary, (the DoP is Jorg Widmer), but then you knew it would be and yes, it is very slow, (as you knew it would be), and it is three hours long but it's also beautifully written by the director and beautifully acted. August Diehl is superb as Franz Jagerstatter, the conscientious objector while Valerie Pachner is equally good as his wife and there are excellent supporting performances from Karl Markovics, Johan Leyson, Johannes Krisch and Franz Rogowski. This is certainly no self-reflective doodle from some inward looking artist with nothing left to say but confirmation of Malick's stature both as a film-maker and as a thinker; it is also incredibly moving in a way Malick's previous films never were. If there's a downside, even for Malick aficionados, it's that it does require a great deal of patience and it could certainly do with a trim here and there but Malick is not the kind of man to make concessions. This will be loved and loathed in equal measure but if you are prepared to give yourself over to it, the rewards are considerable.",A Hidden Life
9,gbill-74877,Powerful stuff,9,1 August 2020,"""A time will come when we will know what all this is for. And there will be no mysteries. We will know why we live. We'll come together. We'll plant orchards, fields. We'll build the land back up. Franz. I'll meet you there, in the mountains.""My favorite moments from Terrence Malick are when we're seeing achingly exquisite images on the screen, something he's giving us almost non-stop, and the narrator floats in a feather of a line, putting something so simply, and yet having the impact of a hammer on my soul. There are several such moments in this film, and each gave me goosebumps.Set in a small village in the mountainous farmland of Austria, the film's beginning is almost breathtakingly beautiful, and the threat to this paradise, Hitler's rise to power, couldn't be more dramatically in opposition. What's frightening about this evil is how quickly the entire town - the church notably included - fall in line, leaving a single man on his own to resist being sent off to wage war in Hitler's name. There are those who belief in the racist ideology of the Nazis (like the town's mayor), those who resent the man for not doing his fair share, and those who are simply too afraid to do anything else. They try every possible way to get him to knuckle under, and the Nazis themselves soon add imprisonment and regular humiliation to it.The film thus explores love, faith, and courage in times of great hardship, and while set in the 1940s, the parallels to today could not be clearer. A heartstopping moment is when the man writes in a letter, ""Oh, my wife. What's happened to our country? To the land we love?"" Another is when the old man painting religious scenes in the church says ""A darker time is coming, when men will be more clever. They won't fight the truth. They'll just ignore it."" These people who see the truth of what's going on despair that ""the whole world's sinking"" and ""is this the end of the world?"" and it's hard not to identify with these feelings.I didn't care as much for all of the Christian faith in the film, even if it was so central and true to these people, and Malick had a tendency to drag things out in ways he probably shouldn't have. To be clear, it's a contemplative film, one asking the viewer the most difficult of questions, e.g. what would you do in this impossible situation, when so many others, in fact everyone around you simply ""followed orders"" in what we know would be horrific ways - and so it's not one that would lend itself to a lot of action in the plot, and needs time to infuse itself into your brain. This is real, it happened, and it's happening again, all the time. With that said, I just think 174 minutes was a lot to ask.The beauty of its cinematography, its graceful poetry, and the power of its message are absolutely sublime, however, and in ways that are profoundly touching. This is a film that transcends the normal bounds of what we see in the medium, and is truly art on another level. I love it for that.",A Hidden Life
10,Cineanalyst,Ruminative Regeneration,9,24 January 2020,"Heralded as Terrence Malick's return to a more-scripted narrative cinema, ""A Hidden Life,"" indeed, seems one of the more comprehensible of the auteur's movies. I prefer ""The Tree of Life"" (2011), a picture that made little sense to me upon initial viewing, but it's admittedly comforting to feel one understands the main thrusts of a work upon a single completion, which is not to say that ""A Hidden Life"" isn't still a ruminative tract of grand philosophical and religious ethics and faith, nature and man, love and war, good and evil, life and death.The main narrative here is a fairly simple one based on real events of a farmer turned persecuted conscientious objector during the Nazi regime and WWII. Taking his time (perhaps, arguably, too much so) to wrought the issues out of this story, however, to span a runtime approaching three hours, Malick presents much of the picture in his trademark fashion as remembrances of sun-lit design, flowing, discovering camerawork and montages that tend to emphasize natural bounty and rustic simplicity underscored by classical music and voiceover soliloquies. He also seems as fascinated with wide-angle lenses and fish-eye views as, say, Yorgos Lanthimos in ""The Favourite"" (2018). Few filmmakers have the patience--including taking years for post-production editing--to allow for deep reflection within the picture and without by the spectator. Consequently, most movies aren't this moving romantically or spiritually.Uniquely impressive in Malick's ""A Hidden Life,"" though, methinks is the effectiveness of the anti-war construction--even more so than the theme of conscience overcoming organized religion. Many films purport to be dovish while inundating us with spectacular and exciting scenes of battle. The last movie I saw in a theatre before this was ""1917"" (2019), which is hardly a pacifist picture at all--rather a thrilling technical achievement balanced by the tension and thrills of war reenactment. Conversely, Hitler and war footage in ""A Hidden Life"" are restricted to other films within the film. These war films are brief, blunt and horrific and serve as the foil to the lovely, searching cinematographic remembrances narrated likewise with poetry and profundity.A similar thing is done with faith, with fiddling Church leaders and an artist of murals remarking on his painting placid pictures of Christ--lamenting how one day he may dare to depict the real passion of Jesus. The contrasts could hardly be more stark. I'm less fond of the non-subtitled mixture of English and German, with the former tending to mark the picture's beauty and the latter mostly restricted to unintelligible belligerence, although, granted, it does distinguish the Nazi rhetoric spewed by characters as especially rabid if the spectator isn't fluent in the language. Regardless, this is another work by Malick that registers for me as probably as near as a motion picture can get to a religious experience--pictorially and audibly, as well as philosophically, romantically and spiritually, sublime.",A Hidden Life
11,westsideschl,Would've Liked It More,8,7 June 2020,"Background: Franz Jägerstätter is a farmer in the Austrian village of St. Radegund. Then the war comes. To Franz the war is unjust; he agonizes if called up to serve. His disapproval of Hitler antagonizes the villagers; many treat him and his family harshly. Every persuasion is used to convince Franz to sign up.
Negative: A bit too fragmented & abstractly wordy a storyline for me thus hard to ""feel"" immersed into the impact of possibly giving your life, and the wellbeing of your family & friends for your beliefs. Didn't know which was true documentary & which was drama.
Positives: This quote in the credits from the female author Mary Ann Evans (pen name George Eliot; 1800s) was most impactful, ""..for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.""

12,eddie_baggins,"A brilliant return to form, one of Malick's finest hours",9,13 February 2020,"After a recent career patch that has proved to be the most divisive of his long-standing career, with modern day set pieces Knight of Cups, Song to Song and To the Wonder leaving most people cold and documentary The Voyage of Time coming and going with very little fanfare, director Terrance Malick returns to the past that has previously worked so well to deliver what is undoubtedly his best film since the triumph of The Tree of Life, in what acts as a stunning return to form.Based on the true story of Austrian farmer and conscientious Nazi objector Franz Jägerstätter, A Hidden Life may be Malick's longest film to date at a whopping 170 plus minutes and while to some this eye-wateringly beautiful film may appear to be nothing more than Austrian farming simulator circa the 1940's, this powerful examination of faith, morals and holding firm to ones beliefs is a moving and unforgettable exercise that makes a powerful case for Malick to stick firm to more structured narrative storytelling moving forward.It's not to say A Hidden Life is unlike Malick's previous classics, with the Texan director instilling his film with his usual visual orientated and voice over storytelling techniques that fits perfectly alongside Jörg Widmer's magnificent cinematography work and James Newton Howard's haunting score, but the fact Malick is here following Jägerstätter's and his wife Fani's true life tale ensures that all the wonder and beauty seen on screen means something more as we are allowed to contemplate and embrace the journey of one man's firm stance against evil.In today's modern age where world leadership and evil in various forms abound, Malick's ethereal journey asks some important questions that may not have clear cut answers but while right and wrong can sometimes blur together in unpredictable and hard to understand ways, he never loses sight of the love story at the heart of this tale that will surely move even the most stoic of viewers.Shot in the picturesque surrounds of Europe (almost every shot of this film could be a painting on a wall) and placed mostly around the small farming township of Franz and Fani's home of St. Radegund, A Hidden Life almost feels as though it takes place in a dreamlike place that could never actually exist, as the loving married couple spend their days entertaining their young girls, tending to their crops and animals and living out their days in a peaceful state but Malick finds a balance between the otherworldly and the harsh realities of WW2 life, that is movingly played out by lead actors August Diehl and Valerie Pachner, who make just as big of a mark as Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen in Badlands and Brooke Adams and Richard Gere in Days of Heaven.While there are questions to be raised about the need for A Hidden Life to run close to the three hour mark, with a portion of the films middle section feeling somewhat repetitive, the layered nature of the film that features an abundance of religious undertones, imagery and questions that sit comfortably alongside an emotionally charged tale of romance and family ensures that for those willing to partake in Malick's latest masterpiece, they will be rewarded with a film that demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate.Final Say -A sadly overlooked return to form for one of cinema's great storytellers, A Hidden Life is not a film to convert those that don't appreciate Terrence Malick's style of film-making but for everyone else, this true life WW2 set tale will take you on a journey you won't soon forget.4 ½ scythes out of 5",A Hidden Life
13,howard.schumann,Reminds us of the power of moral and spiritual commitment,10,4 January 2020,"In its depiction of the life of an Austrian farmer who refused to sign an oath of loyalty to Hitler or to fight in an unjust war, Terrence Malick's (""Song to Song"") nearly three-hour film, A Hidden Life, reminds us of the power of moral and spiritual commitment. Based on the exchange of letters between Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl, ""The Young Karl Marx""), and his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner, ""The Ground Beneath My Feet""), it is a sublime portrait of a man compelled to call upon his last reservoir of strength to maintain his commitment, knowing that his act of conscience will do nothing to stop the war and will put his family and his own life at risk.The film opens in 1939 in the village of St. Radegund in Austria where Franz lives a simple life with his wife and their three daughters. Devout Catholics, they live in a close-knit community, gathering in the local pub on Saturday nights and in church on Sunday mornings. In the rich poetic style Malick is known for, we see fields of grain, pristine flowing streams, awe-inspiring mountain vistas, and children running and playing, as gorgeously photographed by cinematographer Jörg Widmer (""The Invisibles"") and enhanced by the music of James Newton Howard (""Red Sparrow""). To remind us of the context, we view grainy newsreel footage of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, an event that foreshadowed the start of World War II less than two years later.It is clear to Jägerstätter that every able-bodied Austrian man will be forced to sign an oath pledging their allegiance to the Führer but Franz, whose father fought and died in World War I, asks Fani, ""Oh my wife, what has become of our country?"" In 1940, Jägerstätter is conscripted into the Wehrmacht, but is twice sent home on the grounds of his ""reserved civilian occupation"" as a farmer. He refuses to obey a third order, however, recalling a dream in which he saw a train carrying hundreds of Hitler Youth to their death as a warning of the evil of Nazism. In his writing Jägerstätter says that, for him, ""to fight and kill people so that the godless Nazi regime could conquer and enslave ever more of the world's peoples would mean becoming personally guilty.""Since a referendum was held on April 10, 1938 in which an astonishing 99.73 percent of Austrians voted in favor of joining the Third Reich, it is not surprising that Franz receives little support from his neighbors or from the local priest (Tobias Moretti, ""Cold Hell""). A religious man, Franz turns to the Diocesan Bishop of Linz, Joseph Calasanz Fliesser (Michael Nyqvist, ""Frank & Lola"") for support but is told by the Bishop that it is not his task to decide whether the war was righteous or unrighteous. In a powerful scene, a man (Johan Leysen, ""Claire Darling"") who paints murals of a happy Christ on a church ceiling laments the fear that has kept him from painting Jesus' suffering on the cross.In prison, Malick captures Jägerstätter's humanity when he helps a prisoner get up from the ground after a beating and when he sneaks an extra slice of bread to a hungry prisoner. When one of Franz' final judges played by the late Bruno Ganz (""Amnesia"") suggests that the prisoner's principles will change nothing and that if he signs the oath he will go free, Franz smiles and says that he is already free. Though his mother, friends, and relatives try to change his mind, only Fani stands by him saying, ""If I hadn't stood by him, he wouldn't have had anyone at all."" It is only later when he is in a Berlin prison, condemned to die as a traitor, that she begs him to sign a loyalty oath.Malick's point of view, however, is clear and unmistakable as stated in the quote from author George Eliot shown in the film:""For the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.""54 years later, on May 7, 1997, Jägerstätter verdict was annulled by the District Court of Berlin and his martyrdom was officially confirmed by the Vatican ten years later. His beatification took place in St. Mary's Cathedral in Linz in October, 2007 and he is now referred to as Blessed Franz Jägerstätter. How many people in power today who face the same accounting will be remembered for their acts of conscience?",A Hidden Life
14,paul-allaer,"2nd best movie of the year (after ""1917"")",9,25 December 2019,"Couple of comments: this is the latest opus (don't just call it a film) from writer-director Terrence Malick. His recent work has been decidedly mixed, including 2016's ""Knight of Cups"" and, even worse, 2017's ""Song to Song"". I am very pleased to tell you that ""A Hidden Life"" finds Malick back at his very best (think: ""Days of Heaven"", ""The Tree of Life""), as he brings the true story of the WWII Austrian conscientious objector. First, Malick in his well-know way of free-flowing photography manages to create a bond between the characters and us, the viewers. As we watch the seemingly idyllic yet harsh life for Franz and his family in the small Austrian village, we very much care what might (or might not) happen to them. The movie's first hour is almost dream-like (or as my friend with whom I saw the movie said: ""it's a one hour trailer""). Second, the movie sports a fabulous orchestral score, courtesy of veteran Hollywood composer James Newton Howard, that matched, or underscores, the movie's overall feel and mood perfectly. Third, the mostly no-names ensemble cast is absolutely delightful. I admit not being familiar with the led performers' prior work, but August Diehl (as Franz) and Valerie Pachner (as his wife) are absolute tops. Keep your eyes out for a brief (maybe 10 min.) appearance by Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts as the Nazi Captain who first interrogates Franz as to why he refuses to pledge his loyalty to Hitler. Last, but certainly not least, one cannot escape or deny that this film is incredibly timely and political, as the parallels between what happened in Nazi Germany and what is going with the current POTUS are undeniable and, frankly, scary. Not pledging loyalty to Trump is what erstwhile FBI director James Comey got him fired in 2017, if you'll recall. For Trump, it's all about me! me! me!, nothing less and nothing more. Just another cult of personality.",A Hidden Life

16,iquine,Adolf Hitler vs A Simple Man's Moral Compass,10,1 July 2020,"(Flash Review)I have never seen such a calm, sobering and poetic story that revolves around the NAZI's and Hitler's influence. Wow. It is a somber slow burn of a man refusing to go along with following Hitler's beliefs nor deviate from his own moral compass. The story follows the simple life of a rural farming family working the lands in German during the rise of Hitler. Their perspective is one of confusion as to why and how other rural villagers as well as those in the cities can't see the evil that Hitler is persuading his followers to believe. As well as forcing and threatening them to believe. What does this couple do when even their own church goes against Biblical beliefs? How will their lives be changed and challenged by refusing to go along with the NAZI pressures?There is a lot of visually poetic moral and religious questioning and praying as he refuses to resist pledging his allegiance to Hitler. How will the NAZI sympathizers, his local village and even his own mother, who have all fallen in line, handle his refusal to do so? His wife has not and stands with her husband. Once again with all of Malick's films, emotions run deep and are portrayed through an ever-present moving camera at all angles with effective jump cuts and poetic shot framing that allow for contemplation of the scene. This actually has a more cohesive narrative compared with Malick's other films. Additionally, this film had decent amount of German dialog but Malick DID NOT include subtitles because from the cinematography, history and the actors, you know what is being communicated. Bold approach. This is a weighty film that will linger as proper wine legs on the side of the glass.",A Hidden Life

Almost.,7,23 April 2021,"While the film has truly stunning cinematography with a bigger than usual field of view, it is very long and from about the middle, it becomes very repetitive and stretched out.Also, I don't approve of the protagonist's actions. Mainly because ""God doesn't care what you say. Only what's in your heart."" this quote from the film clearly proves that the protagonist is prideful and stubborn instead of being good-willed. He easily could've just humbled himself and just lie the oath, that would not make him betray his beliefs, only his pride.Even though this film failed to reach me as a film about faith, beliefs or fighting against the system, this film still does work pretty well as a love story.P.

19,truemythmedia,"Not for Everyone but Oooo Boy, It's for me!",10,27 February 2020,"I'm a Terrence Malick fan, partially because his movies really touch me but also because I have happened to miss his last couple outings which were, by many accounts, less than stellar. ""Tree of Life"" was one of the first arthouse films I saw in the theater while attending film school so it has a special place in my heart into which I was hoping ""A Hidden Life' would be able to find its way.As I heard the first few opinions begin to leak out about ""A Hidden Life"" I was encouraged but not excited because some of those sources were Christian magazines which have frequently led me astray in the past (ex. ""Hacksaw Ridge""). It turns out that ""A Hidden Life"" is a film right up my alley and holds one of my top spots of 2019.""A Hidden Life"" is about a man named Franz (August Diehl, ""Inglourious Basterds"") and his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner) who live in Austria in the foothills of the Alps. They are farmers and spend most of their hard lives tending fields, animals, and children. It is an idyllic life in many ways and the epitome of the word pastoral. The mountains, fields, and sky are so beautiful that even a less practiced director could capture some of the most stunningly gorgeous footage you've ever seen so rest assured when Terrence Malick (""Badlands"") points his camera their way, the views are even more lovely and sublime.With Germany on the path to war, Franz is conscripted into the military and is returned home, after France has been captured, along with all the other farmers to continue food production. When he arrives, the village and his wife are happy to have him home but there is a new problem for them all. His time in the war has left Franz disillusioned with Germany's campaign, their attitude toward Jews, and a commitment to not aid in the war effort. This makes him a variety of enemies from the town's mayor, to the collectors for the veteran's fund, to the rest of the village who have all learned of his refusal during this extremely hard time. Eventually, he is called up to war again, only this time he will refuse to pledge his allegiance to Hitler. What will the Germans so with him after that betrayal?It really is a pretty simple story and one for which, in any other hands, I would sneer at a 3 hour runtime as being indulgent. In fact, I am sure many will consider the runtime of this film a little extreme. Personally, I do not agree with this assessment. Certainly, the film is long but the length is earned by tight but deep focus on the central conflict of the story. If I felt that the inner monologues, conversations, and threats of violence never went anywhere, never moved Franz's heart, then I would agree but every one of these things feels true to life and has the weight of Life or Death hanging in the balance. This focus on the inner struggle is what makes the film stand out for me. To someone who is looking for the outward struggle, it will appear as if nothing much changes from scene to scene of this film.Franz spends long periods of time soliloquizing to himself, wandering the prison yard, sitting in his cell, and having discussions with lawyers and army officials. Anyone who has spent years laboring over a decision, vacillating between one option and another, one belief and another doubt, or one easy path and one hard but honorable one will understand that the changes in belief, submissions to fate, returns to faith, and real grappling with doubt are subtle variations that may rise and fall from single sentences uttered by others. Great shifts in ways of thinking and hoping can slide abruptly like ice shelves collapsing into the ocean yet the only outside indication of this is on a person's face.Once again, we find ourselves in luck that we are in the hands of a master who tapped August Diehl for the role of Franz. Both he and Valerie Pachner turn in nuanced and forceful performances which break your heart and soul as the prospect of evil and its effect on individuals and communities becomes more apparent and harsh. Yet, these performances lift your soul even as they seem to dig a grave ever deeper for your despair to find rest within. In the midst of the darkness there are small mercies, though maybe not as frequently as we might hope or desire.For me, personally, I found myself asking myself hard questions about the state of the world, the evil being done in it, and how little I do to fight against it. All of the ways that I am complicit in the hurt or deaths of others rise up in my heart as I watch this film and I find myself praying that someday I can do more than hear about a tragedy and post on Facebook or give a couple bucks toward relief. The other thing this film did was sober me for the day when things in my life will not be this easy, when I will have real consequences to the stands I make rather simply enduring a few jokes here and there, online.""A Hidden Life"" has stuck with me because Malick has found a way to relate the interior struggles of someone who holds convictions that are not simply parsed. It doesn't let Franz off the hook nor does it offer him some easy salivation or meaning that makes it all worth it.It doesn't hide from the pain or the beauty of a spiritual struggle even in an industry that typically tries to hide one or the other from view.It doesn't present a rose colored outlook on the Christian life and the rewards and prosperity which God has in store for the faithful like many Christian films but it also doesn't make all Christians look like bigots and hard hearted individuals who don't care about anyone who is different from themselves. It actually portrays Franz the way I prefer; as a human with conviction, weaknesses, doubts, fears, and faith that are swirling around in his head as he walks through life, just trying to scrape out some happiness.I saw myself in this film. What else is there to say except that?",A Hidden Life

21,davidmvining,A Great Film of Incredible and Quiet Power,10,28 October 2020,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Terrence Malick is a genius. This is the first time since The Tree of Life that Malick approached a project with a completed script that everyone got, and this is the first time since The New World that he tells a story linearly. His experimental phase is over, though it does inform his technique here. In the end, Malick came back from his experimental phase with one of his most affecting and devastating films that is deceptively small but betrays much larger ambitions along the way.The true story of Franz Jagersttater, an Austrian conscientious objector during World War II that the Catholic Church beatified in 2007, A Hidden Life contains many of the hallmarks of Malick's entire filmography. We start in an Eden on Earth that will come apart. We have voiceover. There is twirling, though there are few curtains. At the same time, there are interesting variations on it all. The Eden comes crashing down exclusively from outside forces, not because of an inherent flaw of those within it. The voiceover is heavily derived from the real life letters that Franz and his wife Fani wrote to each other. The twirling is about a family of five, including three daughters, rather than just one or two people exploring each other.Franz, like all Austrian men, is eligible for conscription into the German army, but he cannot perform the oath to Hitler, seeing him as an evil man. This opinion, one of goodness, is what starts to tear down Eden around him and Fani's little paradise in the beautiful Austrian north country. The people turn on him. Even the church, represented by the local priest and bishop, are too scared to offer any help, even at the spiritual level, for the poor young farmer wrestling with his conscience. When Franz does get called up, he refuses to take the oath and is immediately arrested when he starts a four month process that leads to his death.Now, I adore this film, but I do think that it's overlong at the same time. If this movie didn't hit me as hard as it did in the final act, I'd think that the overlong first and second hours would be enough of a real problem to knock my rating down a half star. This movie could have preserved the emotional punch of its final half hour by cutting as much as forty-five minutes from the first two hours. However, that emotional punch is still there, and it's the kind of punch that Malick gives me at the end of The New World. So, despite my understanding of the criticism of the film being too long, I both agree and disagree. The overlong sections are mostly derived from the small town's treatment of Franz and Fani after Franz's small act of disobedience becomes public knowledge. There's a good chunk of this footage that could have been cut without sacrificing much.That being said, the movie's power extends from the contrast of its voiceover and the images. I don't think Malick has used voiceover as well as he does here. The voiceover of the final half of the film is mostly just letters that the real Franz and Fani sent each other at the time, and they're full of tender love and concern for the other. This is contrasted with the images of the small cruelties that both husband and wife are suffering at the same time. He suffers the indignities of prison life under Nazi rule including abuse from his guards. She struggles to keep their farm operating along with her sister and small children. They share their hopeful feelings towards each other in their letters, she telling of little stories of their children, all while we see their lives degrading.There are three people after Franz is jailed who directly tempt him with just taking the oath and ending his prison sentence. The first is the attorney at the first prison, urging him to take the oath and do his service. The second is the German official played by Bruno Ganz, looking at this little farmer with pity. The third is Franz's own priest, just before Franz's execution. It is only Fani who decides that Franz must follow his conscience, even if she doesn't quite understand it. What ultimately sells that decision on Fani's part to the audience is those letters of such quiet and humble love that she and Franz share through both of their sufferings.The greatest strength of Malick's production methods is that the individual moments he captures end up feeling so very real on their own. When combined with everything else around them, they help to create a distinct emotional reality for his characters, acting as the prism through which the audience feels the same emotions as his characters. He's gotten really, really good at it, too. The opening is idyllic and beautiful, and we can see and understand the genuine affection that Franz and Fani have for each other as they build their lives together. We see their suffering and feel it the same way. Establishing these characters and having them go through their trials in this improvisational mode with a strong script to carry everything else along adds another dimension to Malick's work not quite present in his previous three films (no matter how much I appreciate and even love them). Malick seems to enter another level of emotional storytelling when he rests his production methods on a script. That may seem like some sort of underhanded compliment, but it's just that I think he's so good even without a script.The final motions of this film had me in a puddle. Malick took this small, nearly forgotten story of a hidden life (a phrase taken from the ending of Middlemarch by George Eliot) and demonstrates the cumulative power of those little actions that make up the world. For any other director this would be a crowning achievement, but for Malick this is just another remarkably great film in a remarkably great career.",A Hidden Life
22,jadepietro,A Hidden Film,8,18 February 2020,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An absolutely beautiful boring film.JIM'S REVIEW: Terence Malick's A Hidden Life is a hidden movie. Released to a few select theaters in December to qualify for Oscar consideration, the film is just getting its national release this February (just as Céline Sciamma's Portrait of a Lady on Fire, a French import). These distributors did a shameful job of promoting their products.Mr. Malick's mediative ode to nature and faith takes its time telling its true story of Franz Jägerstätter, a conscientious objector who refused to fight for the Third Reich during WWII. One knows from the outset that this devout Catholic will surely be punished for his beliefs (as well his family) and that is the essential plot in this nearly 3 hour cinematic journey.The director is the one of the most existential filmmakers in our times and he wrestles with the ideas of free will and its consequences, never accepting predestination theories as another possibility. His dialog is sparse and minimal. Conversations come in forms of debates about good vs evil and man's ability to choose his own life with all of its complications. The philosophic coin has been tossed and let the drama begin S-L-O-W-L-Y.Mr. Malick, known for his lovely panoramic views of landscapes, endless voiceover narration, and foreboding imagery, continues with his trademark style. The film is L-O-N-G and greatly in need of judicious editing. Between all of Franz's brooding and lovely memories of his wife and family in this quaint Austrian village, it takes nearly half of the film until we finally get to his arrest and imprisonment. Once again, Mr. Malick gets sidelined with his picturesque visuals and allows them to overtake his storytelling.I must point out that those visuals remain stunning. Credit Jörg Widmer's photography with a strong assist by the music of James Newton Howard. I personally enjoy the director's unique vision of beauty and can be impressed by the visual sweep of his films. His grandiose style usually overcomes his meagerly scripted tales. This film is more of the glorious same. Fog-shrouded mountain vistas, sun-glistening brooks, rustic countrysides, amber waves of wheat fields...all there. What's missing are the words. Too many beautiful scenic sequences and artfully composed views of farm life fragment the narrative. Character development and plot seem to be an afterthought in his latest effort. (I also found portions of the film to be jarring when some of the characters would speak mostly in English and others inexplicitly communicated in German. Perhaps, the film could have resonated more as a foreign film with subtitles with the actors speaking in their native language.)The plot itself has a familiarity that tends to hinder the story, allowing for predictability to settle in, even though the story is set in authentic European locations, including the actual cottage of the Jägerstätter family. Voiceover narration substitutes with the characters becoming merely props who spout their tenets and religious credos about God and country.What elevates the film, beside the aforementioned cinematography, is the performances by the two leads. As the devoted couple, August Diehl and Valerie Pachner use their acting skills to fill in the gaps from the uneven script. Their facial expressions and method acting convincingly brings the raw pathos and romance to their conflicted characters. One wished more time was spent on the love story aspects than the war of ideologies and religion.Mr. Malick's obsession about man's conscience and flaws are thoroughly intertwined in the basic story of a good man and the injustices he must endure. He is more concerned with bigger worldly issues than a fine little story about lost love that gets lost in his theoretical wordplay. Still if a philosophic treatise about the fate of a common man coming to terms with his faith and ethical dilemmas is an intriguing subject, A Hidden Life, is worth the three hours of your life. When the world turns immoral. where does one hide?",A Hidden Life
23,JuguAbraham,Wish the film was in German with English subtitles,8,21 January 2020,"I am a fan of Malick. He is one of best filmmakers in the US. Yer he can make good and not-so-good films. A HIDDEN LIFE is not his best work. His best works are ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""The Tree of Life."" The biggest problem of A HIDDEN LIFE is that he chose to make the film in English when minor characters speak/mumble in German or in English with a heavy German accent.One cannot fault the subject of the film. it is remarkable and relevant even today in many parts of the world suffering under bad rulers/governments.The cinematography and choice of musical pieces are top notch. His love for Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 continues--he used it earlier in The Tree of Life , To the Wonder and Knight of Cups. His love for the music of Arvo Part continues -- ""Sarah was 90 years old"" and ""Tabula Rasa.""It is sad the film was not chosen for any Oscar nomination--it deserved one for at least for its cinematography and/or for its music.",A Hidden Life
24,bandw,Malick has honed his style to near perfection.,10,21 September 2020,"After his masterpiece ""The Tree of Life"" Malick's subsequent movies (""To the Wonder"", ""Knight of Cups"", and ""Song to Song"") struck me that he was working through some internal struggles on how to present enigmatic material, with each of the three movies successively making more and more demands on the viewer. For me Malick can do almost do no wrong, but ""Song to Song"" was too esoteric for me. So, I was delighted to see him return to a more accessible presentation in ""A Hidden Life."" In this movie he has perfected many of his trademarks: brilliant cinematography, haunting score, moral questions, bucolic scenery contrasted with harsh realities, the use of a Steadicam, natural lighting, flowing water, and so forth.The story is easily summarized: a young Austrian farmer, Franz Jägerstätter, resists serving in WWII. When I first read about this storyline it seemed like an odd choice for Malick, but very early on you can see that the moral implications of the story would attract him. I found this to be the most overtly religious of the nine Malick movies I have seen. Bergman would have appreciated this movie.I like the way Malick films people, usually people in motion. He can make following a person walking interesting. His cuts from the current time frame to one several seconds later are effective. Also the camera is usually in motion, moving around and in and out. The effect is that of a lived experience. I have never seen the filming of children at play more captivating--moments of joy in an otherwise heavy film.I have never been able to quite figure out Malick's fascination with water. There are several cuts to images of rivers, ditches, falling water here. For me they serve as a clearing of the palate between scenes. But maybe as a symbol of the eternal river of life? There is even a water wheel thrown in for good measure. Maybe there is nothing to figure out beyond absorbing the images and the mood they create.I had never seen August Diehl (as Franz) nor Valerie Pachner (as Franz's wife Fani). They were up to the task, being able to express emotion by way of facial expression. All of the less prominent characters gave quality performances. I was particularly impressed with Karin Neuhäuser who plays Franz's mother. I found the scenes between Franz and his mother moving.Franz felt that he could not participate in Germany's war effort, on moral grounds, in particular he could not pledge allegiance to Hitler. If this had not been based on a true story I would have had trouble with Franz's unshakable conviction, given that he had a family and suffered contumely from his community. As might be expected the Nazi's were not having any part of Franz's behavior. Over and over people argued with Franz about why he was behaving so adamantly, voicing the sentiment, ""No-one will know."" Even the Catholic priests and bishops urged him to back off and the townspeople shunned him and accused him of being a traitor. From the image I have of the Nazis I would have expected them to just shoot Franz and have done with it, but no, he was ultimately represented at a trial. Maybe the Nazis did not want his case to be a cause celebre? I think of the many people I knew who fled to Canada to escape the Vietnam war, but I remember one guy who simply said, ""I'm not going,"" and went to prison for a year and got out with his dignity intact. His act precipitated many of the behaviors depicted in this movie, except certain death was not part of the equation.As in most Malick movies the score is an essential ingredient. The score here is his usual mixture of original music (composed here by James Newton Howard) and known classical pieces. Parts of Gorecki's 3rd symphony are a perfect fit for some scenes and using work of Arvo Part is a natural for this movie. All of the music accentuates a spiritual yearning or questioning which I surmise is essential to Malick as a person.Malick not only directed this, he wrote the screenplay. Though not heavy on dialog or narration, there were some quotes I liked: ""Better to suffer injustice than to do it.""; ""What do you do if you believe your leaders are evil?""; ""If God gives us free will, then we are responsible for what we do and for what we fail to do.""I was left with an appreciation of how much thought went into the presentation of each scene.",A Hidden Life
25,krocheav,A Hidden Life - Doesn't hide its Indulgences,5,7 December 2020,"As with 70% of Mr Malick's latter works, this one runs forever - while telling what amounts to little more than a short story. Deeply spiritual and at times superb looking, it suffers from his trade-mark extended minimalist style. The editing is often abysmal with jarring continuity jump cuts, possibly revealing the fact many scenes were too long, with little to say, so were cut down to serve their purpose. To some, this may look trendy but for many it's merely shoddy to look at. On paper, this potent story would have looked impressive - yet the final result on screen will reflect only a small percentage of its power.For a fact-based story, it amazed me that the cruel German prison system allowed any letters to be written, let alone sent. I'd have also assumed any that were forwarded would have been heavily censored - in this situation that appears not to be the case. Characters often come and go with little introduction, so acute concentration is required. Thankfully, the last half is a little more structured than the somewhat messy first - this helps to follow the shockingly harsh struggle this tragic fellow was forced to endure. His wife and children are left battling the elements and unfriendly village neighbors, as they attempt to survive by working their farm without him. Sadly, it seems the local church did little to support his unfairly ostracized family, giving poor acknowledgement of his strong Catholic faith and the family's church service in years prior. Appears the Catholic Church shamefully colluded with the Nazi war machine too often. This is sad indeed. Germany was determined to take control by force but force devoid of love was bound to fail.Festivals and those who like Terrence Malick's 'style' may last the way over-long distance but others may tune out early on. This is unfortunate, as it's a story that deserves a better treatment. An effectively compiled music score helps carry it some of the way.Will please devotees or the patient.",A Hidden Life
26,Jeremy_Urquhart,A long and patience-testing film that nevertheless has some good qualities.,6,10 February 2020,"Terrence Malick's latest was somewhat hyped up as a ""return"" to more narrative-focused films for the legendary and notoriously reclusive filmmaker. This is only partly true, to be honest. It does have a stronger storyline than the visually beautiful but often dull and meandering Knight Of Cups (I have not seen To The Wonder or Song To Song, and am not really in a rush to either), but it's a rather slight story stretched to the kind of running time usually reserved for huge, epic movies. Basically, what we have here is a fairly simple plot of a man sticking to his principles and refusing to fight for the Nazis in World War 2, and coming into conflict with almost everyone around him for doing so. The scope isn't huge, nor is the cast of characters particularly large. The gorgeous outdoor backdrops, which are frequently beautiful to look at, do recall some classic Hollywood-style epics, but this is a small, character driven story, and apart from said backdrops, not really one that has much spectacle.This could well work for some audiences. If you find yourself utterly transfixed by the film's flow, style, and overall message, this could well be an extremely rewarding cinematic experience. For me, however, I found myself engaged some of the time, entranced a couple of times, and somewhat restless and bored at other times. It was an inconsistent movie, to say the least, with sequences that could sometimes be beautiful, harrowing, or otherwise quite emotionally affecting, and others that felt so unnecessary. The occasionally maligned Malick monologues were this way for me too- sometimes they worked, but sometimes they seemed extremely repetitive. One character would narrate about a theme or an idea that I could've sworn they'd already talked about at some stage before. At a point, you want to tell Malick: ""yes, we get it. We could understand all of this in a movie under two hours, not just shy of three.""This sense of inconsistency unfortunately carries over into many of the film's other technical aspects. This is a film that is both well acted at times, and then awkwardly acted at others. The two leads are both quite good, with Diehl in particular impressing in what is often a fairly dialogue-free performance, and some of the supporting cast is solid. Some, however, aren't so good, and the inconsistent dialogue doesn't help those weaker performers. As mentioned before, the narration doesn't always work, and then when the film tries at times to tell the story through dialogue and exposition, it can falter a little too. The characters sometimes don't talk or act like real people, with the framing being awkward at times as well. It really clashes with how authentic the sets, costumes, and overall production design look also.So... it's beautiful to look at, right? Again: sometimes. A lot of those landscape shots are gorgeous. The use of lighting and colour is great, and some of the direction is really engaging and satisfying to behold (one smooth tracking shot behind a vehicle as it glided through the countryside, near the film's conclusion, was particularly staggering). At other times though, the camerawork is oddly scrappy, almost as though Malick was making a high-budget Dogme 95 film with very good lighting. It really clashes with the shots that are beautiful and well thought out. Similarly, the intentionally choppy editing sometimes works to heighten a scene's emotions, and sometimes it doesn't.Like A Hidden Life, I feel as though I'm starting to repeat myself. But these repeated inconsistencies ring true, in my opinion: everything in this film is done well in some parts, and then disappointingly poorly in others. It's a strangely messy film from the once notoriously perfectionistic Malick, and for those expecting something closer to his old films than his previous three before this one, you might be disappointed. It rides the line between old and new Malick, and as such, is somewhat engaging and compelling, and somewhat tedious and overlong. Give it a shot if you're a big Malick fan, of either era in his filmmaking history. Otherwise, I'd suggest most filmgoers stay away.",A Hidden Life
27,tm-sheehan,Beautifully filmed and fascinating true story,8,31 March 2021,"My Review - A Hidden Life Prime VideoMy Rating 8/10The film takes its title from the last sentence of Middlemarch by George Eliott: ""... for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.""Written and Directed by Terrence Malick this film is long nearly 3 hours and slow but beautifully paced the performances are very moving and the beautiful Austrian scenery is quite breathtaking. I couldn't help thinking as this dramatic sad Rural story was taking place in Alpine St Radegund nearby in Salzburg another family and it's breadwinner Captain Von Trapp were escaping the Nazi regime in Austria.This is a story of a very ordinary community that have lived a simple rural existence for generations and what happens to that community when their pastoral idyll is smashed by the cruel dogs of war ? One of their own quiet hero's decides he cannot in good conscience join Hitlers Reich and kill his fellow human beings.It shows beautifully how the attitudes of once friendly and supportive neighbours turns to vilification and isolation of his wife and daughters when he is sent to prison.I think it's a film that very effectively tells the story through the letters of Franz and Fani whose love for each other never ceases .I did find myself asking was it the right decision for Franz to put his family and life at risk when he was offered an non violent hospital job but he couldn't capitulate to Adolph Hitler but it's a little like asking why someone chooses euthanasia rather than pain relief , it's their right to choose.Based on real events, this story was little known outside St. Radegund, and might never have been discovered, were it not for the research of Gordon Zahn, an American, who visited the village in the 1970s.The actors are unknown to me but give excellent performances Franz Jägerstätter played by August Diehl who refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War II he gives a very moving , honest and brave performance
in this film.It is his unwavering faith and his love for his wife, Fani ( Valerie Pachner) and children that keeps his spirit alive. The story was little known outside St. Radegund, and might never have been discovered, were it not for the research of Gordon Zahn, an American, who visited the village in the 1970s.While shooting of the film in Radegund, took place at the actual house of Jägerstätters, both August Diehl and Valerie Pachner met with the daughters of Franz and Fani's -Maria, Rosalia and Aloisa- who still live in the same village where their parents had lived.A couple of days before the world premiere of A Hidden Life in Cannes Film Festival, there was a special screening for the daughters of Jägerstätters at their home. According to Valerie Pachner, the three sisters satisfiedly liked the film.This film was a labour of love for Director
Terrence Malick who spent almost three years editing this film.The lighting is very effective in this movie and it's interesting to read that artificial lights were only used on rare occasions during shooting. For all the other sets, including the prison cells, the team simply used the right time of the day to shoot it until they lost the light.According to James Newton Howard, who had compote beautifully simple score for the movie he felt his composition was best to reflect the vistas of St. Radegund. Accordingly for Howard, the solo violin throughout the film embodies the connection between two main characters in the film.Franz Jägerstätter was declared a martyr and beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in June 2007. His feast day is the day of his christening, 21 May.Franziska Jägerstätter, the widow of Austrian conscientious objector and martyr Franz Jägerstätter, died March 16, 2013 two weeks after celebrating her 100th birthday.This is a complex story told in a beautifully but brutal narrative, it's long but I found it really left me thinking about the unsung heroes and the cruel consequences of War . It left me very grateful that I have lived through relative Peace compared to the turmoils of the first half of last Century.",A Hidden Life

29,Alexander_Blanchett,Two worlds collide,9,1 February 2020,"Finally Terrence Malick is back with a real masterpiece and his best film since ""The Tree of Life"". Its a film that really gets under your skin if you embrace to it. Malick's longest film is also one of his most emotional and thought provoking ones in a way. We show two different worlds colliding with each other. Malick takes a lot of time to really show the idyllic and peaceful life of Austrian villagers, far away from the cruelty of the world, but collides with it when one of the villagers is called in for war but declines. August Diehl wonderfully plays this real life figure and gives a truly tour de force performance. A performance that is only challenged by Valerie Pachner who is just outstanding, especially in the second half of the film. We got the last roles of Bruno Ganz and Michael Nyqvist, although rather cameos than real supporting roles but thats most of the cast expect for Diehl and Pachner as those two actors play characters that embodie the whole emotions of people that are forced into a war they dont want.
Typically for Terrence Malick you are treated with a fantastic cinematography. Unforgettable images of pure and innocent nature. It is fantastic how he links that to the true hell...and combines it (take notice of the constant bird singing in the film) He uses it as its second protagonists and symbol the same time. Also the score by James Newton Howard is fantastic and emotional. It is long yes but except for a section after 2 hours it doesn't feel like it because Malick needs that time to bring the people, their believes and culture close to his audience.",A Hidden Life

32,gsygsy,A challenge,8,27 November 2019,"Nearly half a century lies between this film and the only previous Terrence Malick I'd seen, BADLANDS, which I admire very much and have watched a number of times. As might be expected, he's a very different film maker now. I found A HIDDEN LIFE something of a puzzle. It is undoubtedly beautiful to watch, even as its subject matter gets progressively grimmer. Its religiosity was something of a challenge to me, as was its stilted dialogue. Its story is the familiar one of a man suffering for what he believes. It is the story of John Procter, the hero of Arthur Miller's play THE CRUCIBLE; it is the story of Ibsen's Dr Stockmann, in the play ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. And of course it's the story of Jesus Christ. There is a tragic grandeur to all of these, and, whatever my reservations about it, there is tragic grandeur to A HIDDEN LIFE. My husband found it unbearably pretentious. I can see why. But I admire the way that this film isn't like anyone else's, that Malick has, in the course of the last half-century, found a way of working that delivers something unique. It certainly won't be to everyone's taste, and aspects of it test one's patience. All the same, I was glad to have seen it, not least for the cinematography and the performances, and the retelling of a story that we all still need to hear in these troubled times.",A Hidden Life

This quote by George Eliot is what summarises A Hidden Life, a selfless and silent act of dissent by the film's hero that is perhaps debatable, yet powerful in it's own way in defining what character is all about.A Hidden Life is the love story of Franz (August Diehl) and Fani (Valerie Pachner), a couple that leads a blessed and fulfilling life, albeit one of physical hardships, in their village in Austria, with their three angelic daughters. Their lives are turned upside down when Franz is summoned to serve in Hitler's army where he experiences a revolt from within seeing unknown people dying for no rhyme or reason. He returns to his village to refuse loyalty to Hitler at all costs and begins a symbolic protest of not giving in. His act is considered one of treachery and he is taken to prison where he faces immense persecution, but refuses to buck down.So strong are his principles that absolutely no retribution against him and even the possibility of never returning to his family will deter him. Director Terence Malick handles the subject with sensitivity. The film is perhaps tad too long, but I suppose it was important to reinforce the emotions and a relationship of unflinching love. The cinematography by Jorg Widmer is the film's trump card - fires up a mesmerising backdrop and produces riveting momentum. Valerie Pachner's performance is superlative and worth an award. Her quiet demeanor and strong physicality accentuate her personality that complements Franz's silent protest and indifference to Hitler's threat.",A Hidden Life
38,TheVictoriousV,Malick's most accessible film,8,24 November 2020,"There has been some discussion, especially after the Oscars ceremony of this year, that Terrence Malick's A Hidden Life is the film that truly warrants the high praise directed at Jojo Rabbit, the goofy ""My Pet Hitler"" comedy, by the Academy and media. A strange comparison, you might think, but not random:A big problem that many shared with Jojo Rabbit was that it didn't properly confront the values and tribalist thought processes that shaped Nazi Germany, instead pointing and laughing at Der Führer (made wacky by Taika Waititi) and maybe making some toothless jokes that reference more modern fears of white supremacy, ethnonationalism, and political idol worship. I was told A Hidden Life was more astute and ""useful"" in this sense, but what I particularly responded to was the depiction of a struggle within people of faith (hitherto deeply convinced of a benevolent creator) forced to behold the reality of war.Without arriving at whichever simplified answer one may prefer, the film asks several questions about a loving God and the simultaneous existence of evil. What if (and this is the timely part) religious authorities even seem to embolden the evil? Why? Doth God will it? Are we the baddies?It certainly isn't a war movie in the vein of 1917, nor any of the less stylistic action entries within the genre. This one, you might say, instead focuses on the thoughts inspired by war, while its main plot focuses on an Austrian soldier, Franz (August Diehl), who refuses to fight for the Führer at all. A war movie doesn't need explosions to be this moving.This is also a remarkable film within the Malick catalog, in how it constitutes his first linear story in quite a while - as opposed to playing like a series of picturesque memories accompanied by whispery ADR musings. It proves that artsy ""experience"" films aren't the only thing Malick can do; the thoughtfulness and gorgeousness we expect from him can indeed be carried over into something more digestible.Since the movie has been shooting for a while, it also constitutes the final film of both Bruno Ganz (getting to play one last Nazi) and Michael Nyqvist. Other castmembers include a wonderful Valerie Pachner as Franz's thoughtful (almost angelic) wife Franziska, as well as Jürgen Prochnow, Matthias Schoenarts, and other European performers who speak a curious amount of English. Was it as ubiquitous a lingua franca during World War II? Perhaps. I don't remember that class too well. But German might have been more useful to these characters, still.This film was definitely snubbed for its technical achievements; Malick's usual wide-angle photography (which also contrasts the vast rural beauty of Franz's home with the tight and/or dull environments he ends up in) as well as his purposeful jump-cuts. James Newton Howard's soundtrack may have been another snub, but doesn't it sound like he just tweaked his score for 2004's The Village and reused it?And as I mentioned, the questions explored by the film are fascinating - even, or perhaps especially, to someone like myself. To me, the existence of a loving creator with an intelligent design in mind was always a self-evidently flawed notion (I became more of a believer when I read a theory that God does exist, and is evil). As for those who continued to believe in spite of the realities of the world, I would often blame idiocy or wishfulness (religion, despite encouraging ""feelings over reason"" and unfounded certainty of difficult questions, does give comfort).I might sometimes forget that people of faith aren't comic caricatures. I realize that they are humans, and that there can be a truly devastating mental struggle at play when what one wants to believe is faced by what's actually there.Getting to follow such a journey winds up a little bit more intriguing than having Pure Flix spell out what the objective answer is (despite ultimately choosing the faith over the objective tools) and who's deffo in the wrong.

41,Bertaut,A meditation on morality and faith; a film of unparalleled sublimity; an experience beyond the sensory,9,31 January 2020,"Always an explicitly Christian filmmaker, writer/director Terrence Malick has never been didactic, dogmatic, or puritanical. No matter how lofty his vision, his films remain always rooted in the human soul, in the tradition of Heidegger's existential phenomenology, which focuses on the ontology of the earthly Dasein (""being-there"") rather than the epistemology of the Lebenswelt (""lifeworld"") - even the most overtly metaphysical scenes in Malick remain focused on the physical. And A Hidden Life, which may be his most ostensibly Christian work yet, is quintessentially Malickian, featuring many of his most identifiable stylistic traits (whispered voice-overs, sweeping cameras spinning around non-stationary characters, the beauty of nature contrasted with the ugliness of humanity). Malick's films are about the search for transcendence in a compromised and often evil world, and, telling the true story of the Austrian conscientious objector Franz Jägerstätter, A Hidden Life is no different. And how good is it? Very, very, very good. Not quite The Thin Red Line (1998)/The Tree of Life (2011) good, but certainly Badlands (1973)/Days of Heaven (1978)/The New World (2005) good. This is cinema at its most sublimely pious, a supremely talented master-auteur operating at the height of his not inconsiderable powers. You don't watch A Hidden Life. You let it enter your soul.Austria, 1938. In the bucolic village of Sankt Radegund, peasant farmer Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl) lives a simple but blissful life with his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner) and their family. A devout Christian, he's unenthusiastic about the looming war, despite its widespread popularity in the village. Called up to basic training, he's away for several months, but when France surrenders in June 1940, it's thought that the war will soon end, and he's sent home without having been deployed. However, as time goes by, and as the war shows no signs of ending, his opposition grows ever more ingrained, to the point where his family are being harassed. Eventually, he's conscripted, but refuses to swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler, and so is arrested and imprisoned.Needless to say, Malick fashions this material into a thematically rich mosaic. To a certain extent, all his films deal, to one degree or another, with the notion of the corruption of Eden, and Hidden Life is as literal as Thin Red Line and New World in this respect. Sankt Radegund is an earthly paradise, hidden in the embrace of the nearby mountains, fed by the River En (the film was originally called simply Radegund, before adopting the George Eliot quote as its title). However, as the war takes hold, the village comes under attack, not by bombs, but by ideological complicity. The harmony and idealism have been corrupted, not by Franz's refusal to comply, by everyone else's insistence on compliance. The village at the end of the film is an infinitely different place from that at the start, a tainted place. Eden has fallen.Franz doesn't resist the Nazis because he wants to spearhead a movement or because of political high-mindedness. His reasons are simpler - he believes that God teaches us to resist evil, and as a great evil, he must therefore resist Nazism. There's nothing egotistical and precious little that's political in this stance. It's not even a question of personal morality. In an important exchange with Judge Lueben (the late, great Bruno Ganz), Franz is asked, ""Do you have a right to do this?"", to which he responds, ""Do I have a right not to?"" His resistance is ingrained in his very soul. Indeed, watching him head willingly toward his tragic fate, turning the other cheek to the prison guards who humiliate and torture him, he becomes something of a Christ figure, with his time in prison not unlike the Passion. An important conversation concerning this is when he is speaking to Ohlendorf (Johan Leysen), a cynical artisan who is restoring the local church's artwork. Ohlendorf laments that he must work not on images of Christ's suffering as it was, but on the sanitised version desired by the clergy, and he lacks the courage to do otherwise; ""I paint their comfortable Christ, with a halo over his head. Some day I might have the courage to venture. Not yet. Some day. I'll paint the true Christ."" It's a subtle summation of Franz's situation, of course, but so too of the film, which shows Franz's suffering as it was even as it celebrates the power of faith to transcend such suffering.In this sense, much like Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) in Thin Red Line, Franz is a Heideggerian sein-zum-tode (""being-towards-death""). This describes not the hastening towards the end of Dasein in a biological sense but is rather about the process of growing in the Lebenswelt to a point where one gains an authentic perspective, as one comes to completely accept the temporality of this existence, and hence no longer fear death. The application to both Witt and Franz is obvious - both men accept that this world is transitory and that life is simply part of the soul's eternal journey, so neither man fears death, and by not fearing it, they triumph over it.Aesthetically, as one expects from Malick, A Hidden Life is almost overwhelmingly beautiful, particularly in its depiction of nature. Shooting digitally, Malick and his first-time cinematographer Jörg Widmer shot most of the exteriors (and some of the interiors) in a wide-lens anamorphic format that distorts everything outside the dead-centre of the frame. The effect is subtle (we're not talking fisheye lens distortion), but important - pushing the mountains further around the village, bringing the sky closer, elongating the already vast fields. This is a land beyond time, a modern Utopia that kisses the very sky.The film opens with the sounds of birds chirping and a river flowing, followed by a voice-over in which Fani invokes the natural grandeur of Sankt Radegund (""I thought that we could build our nest high-up. In the trees. Fly away like birds to the mountains""). All of this before we see a single image. The film then begins (and closes) on breath-taking shots of the mountains around the village. However, a lot of the VO is epistolary, with large portions taken from the letters Franz and Fani write to one another when he was in prison. For Malick, this is a very conventional style to employ, especially insofar as his VOs have been getting more and more abstract as his films have gone on.As for problems, as a Malick fanatic, I found very few. You know what you're getting with a Malick film, so complaining about the length (it's just shy of three hours) or the pace is kind of pointless. You know if you like how Malick paces his films, and if you found, for example, New World boring beyond belief, so too will you find Hidden Life. One thing I will say, though, there are a few scenes in the last act that are a little repetitive, giving us information we already have or hitting emotional beats we've already hit. It could also be argued that the film abstracts or flat-out ignores the real horrors of World War II, but that's by design. It isn't about those horrors, and Thin Red Line proves Malick has no problem showing man's inhumanity to man. The same is true for politics; much like 1917 (2019), Hidden Life is not about politics, so to accuse it of failing to address politics is to imply it's obliged to address politics. Which it most certainly is not.In the end, A Hidden Life left me profoundly moved, on a level that very, very few films have (Thin Red Line and Tree of Life amongst them). Less a film than a spiritual odyssey, if you're a Malick fan, you should be enraptured. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it a masterpiece, but it's certainly close and is easily the best film of 2019 that I've seen thus far (the fact that it missed out on a single Academy Award nomination is a commentary unto itself).",A Hidden Life
42,cgearheart,This would've been better as a documentary,5,30 December 2019,I love Terrance Malick and I was honestly really excited to see this movie but it bored me to tears. Franz' story was very moving and incredible but the subject wasn't something that could be stretched into 3 hours. The imagery was beautiful and the acting was good but not a lot really happened. It was kind of a huge slog with a lot of voice overs of people reading letters. I'm sad I'm giving this movie such a negative review but it was just such a disappointment.C,A Hidden Life
43,Come-and-Review,Terrence Malick's return,10,20 November 2019,"A Hidden Life is his return to a more linear storyline, albeit Malick's style has been greatly affected by his previous three experimental movies, in a good way.To The Wonder, Knight of Cups and Song to Song were very interesting experiments, but are very hard to enjoy for most viewers. Malick had to eventually return to utilize a plot.In the frame of a beautiful alpine scenery, A Hidden Life is a real story of civil disobedience during Nazi Germany. Much as Malick's style dictates, it analises deeply its characters feelings and thoughts, raising questions on the ethics of obeying or disobeying an unjust government. Jagerstatter slowly becomes a silent, Christ-like character, judged by men who are forced to condemn him despite being touched by his determination.A Hidden Life has a very loose plot. Rather than a structured plot, it feels like the more or less random succession of scenes, sometimes shot in that improvisational style that has dominated Malick's last three films. The voice overs however provide a very linear structure to the film, as mostly they are letters written by Franz and his wife to each other. The contents of the voice-overs are less philosophical and more sentimental, every-day related, which reminds of Malick's 70s films Badlands and Days of Heaven, rather than the post-Thin Red Line films.On a closing note, we must praise the work of Malick's crew: Jörg Widmer, who has replaced Lubetzki for the photography, provides a notable conematographic style that, while mantaining that visual look that Malick's 21st Century films have, has its own beauty and peculiarity. The all-german cast delivered a wonderful english-speaking performance. August Diehl had one particular scene in which he conveyed strong feelings without uttering any word. Viewers might appreciate Bruno Ganz's final appearance in a film, in a Pilatesque role.I personally believe that this film is among Malick's best, probably second only to The Tree of Life, The Thin Red Line and maybe Days of Heaven. Definitely one of the best movies of this year.",A Hidden Life

Treated as a traitor to his country, he & his family face a lot of humiliation & abuse from their compatriots. Even in the face of all this adversity, Franz continues with his steadfast belief that what the Nazis are doing is evil. Fani is great as the supportive wife who never really questions her husband's motives. She totally understands Franz's need to do what he must. What was touching about Franz's belief is that he does not suffer from any delusions of grandeur that his sacrifice is going to make any difference! He doesn't assume any sainthood (although ironically he was granted one anyway, much later of course!) & is not preachy about his beliefs. Instead, he is just doing what his conscience is telling him to. Though he doesn't really understand why no one else is opposing Hitler's evil propaganda, he never foists his opinions on others & is non-confrontational, even in the face of great provocation. So great is Franz's characterization that you almost fall in love with this humble soul who, even during periods of extreme personal distress, always notices other people's woes & extends a helping hand! All the scenes with Bruno Ganz are very poignant. He played the judge & going by what I read in the trivia about his character, Mr. Ganz was spot on! When Franz is asked by the judge if he has a right to do what he is doing, he replies by asking the judge if he has a right not to! Notice Mr. Ganz's body language & subtle nuances, & you'll see what I mean.It's brilliant how Mr. Malick has managed to show such a powerful & intense love between the lead pair without using any gratuitous sex scenes. The chemistry is almost surreal. It's in each glance & each gesture that they make towards each other. It felt like a perfect marriage of the hearts & minds! Every time they think of each other, they are virtually transported to a tranquil & beautiful window of time. All the emotions are so beautifully portrayed that sometimes they broke my heart, but then again I like to get my heart broken from time to time! A unique attribute of this movie is that it will make you slow down & enjoy each moment in quiet contemplation.The direction, cinematography & acting are all superb. The lead pair & Bruno Ganz are worth special mention. Also, it was nice to see a lot of well-known faces in minor roles. In fact, the beautiful backdrop of Europe is done so magnificently that it provides a sharp contrast to the unrest & strife of those times. One fails to see what the world was fighting about when there was so much beauty all around!",A Hidden Life
45,Moviegoer19,Gorgeous and Devastating,10,23 March 2020,"I had never heard of Franz Jagerstatter before watching A Hidden Life. I watched the first two thirds of the film with my eyes and mouth open wide at both the visual beauty and the horror of the film. By the last third, however, I was angry and sad at the story of this man's life and death.Certainly, anyone who had the courage to say no to the Nazis would today be considered a hero by most of us. But by the end of the film I was seeing him more as selfish and stubborn. The scene in which he and his wife, Fani, are discussing whether he should go back to the service, or stay out and either run away or hide in the mountains, both of which seemed like good ideas to me. Then Fani foreshadows what is to happen by saying, ""Maybe you will wind up working in a hospital."" This turns out to be an offer made to him once he has declared his resistance and is in prison. He declines the offer. This is where the film lost me, for this was a way he could have satisfied both his desire to adhere to his wish to not do what he didn't consider right, and to stay alive and return to his beloved family.As long as Franz knew he wouldn't have to kill anyone, why wasn't that acceptable to him? Sticking to his belief of not standing with the Nazis became more important to him than his wife, children, mother, and country. He seemed to me like a stubborn child saying no, no, no, I won't do it, and not thinking about what his actions meant to anyone else.The religious aspect, of course, was a big part of his actions, though he was not portrayed as a great believer before he actually had to be. Suddenly, he was a pious man, reminding me of the saying ""Everyone finds god in the trenches."" As someone who is not religious I found his faith spurious.While the story of Franz and Fani was the theme of the film, the larger story was about evil thriving in a world that's so full of beauty. As one of the characters says at one point, ""The sun shines the same on both good and evil.""What makes the film so powerful and hugely emotional is how grandly it plays to the senses: the visuals are spectacular; the music is perfect for evoking the intense moods; and there is a palpable sense of touch such as when Fani digs in the dirt, and the frequent presence of water, and the hay, and the animals. It's incredibly physical.I did not find it too long. What I did find overly drawn out were some of the prison scenes. Also many of the scenes with both Fani and Franz, alone and together, were repetitive.Overall, it's a film that perfectly shows the human condition: life on earth as both stunningly beautiful, as well as gut-wrenching and sad; the inherent polarity of existence.",A Hidden Life
46,eelen-seth,Stretched to the limit - intoscreens.com,5,26 January 2020,"Director Terrence Malick isn't known for his very straight forward story telling methods. Surprisingly 'A Hidden Life' is his most mainstream film in years. In saying that, he doesn't necessarily let go of his visionary filmmaking strategy, but makes it more approachable for audiences who unknowingly sit down for a Malick-film.Based on real events, A Hidden Life is the story of Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl - Inglourious Basterds), who refused to fight for the Nazis in World War II. When the Austrian farmer is faced with the threat of execution for treason, it is his unwavering faith and his love for his wife, Fani (Valerie Pachner - The Ground Beneath My Feet), and children that keeps his spirit alive.After an introduction to late 1930s' Nazi uprising, using real footage of Hitler around that time, we dive into the breathtaking scenery of Radegund, Austria - and also the close-by natural beauty of Italy. We meet the Jägerstätter-family - close-ups and shaky cam are used to get a more ""natural"" feeling of intimacy, but while the English narration of the story switches between Franz and Fani, the actors interact with their fellow family members and other farmers in the village in almost incomprehensible German (there's also no subtitles, for those who really wonder what they're saying). It makes you think Malick wrote the story after the entire thing had already been filmed.After being sent to Enns Military Base in 1940, Franz's conscience gets in the way and he realises he doesn't want to kill people in war. When back in Radegund, he asks for guidance from his excellensie (played by the late Michael Nyqvist - John Wick). When a trio of nazi's visit the village to ask for a contribution to the army, Franz decides to send them away, as he isn't interested in pledging allegiance to Hitler, which causes the small farmers town to turn their back on the Jägerstätter-family, out of shame. Resenting his pride, the townspeople bully the couple and curse at them on every possible occasion, even long after Franz gets taken into custody for treason.The almost three hour long film feels much longer than that. Without much happening throughout its runtime, there's always a chance of people leaving the theatre before the credits start rolling. There's no need to cut back to scenery for minutes at a time, or just watching kids playing in the grass, when this doesn't contribute to any narrative you're trying to persuade. Malick is a pro at doing so. His films are without a doubt made for cinephiles, who like to dissect every single shot and find a meaning behind certain angles within the story. Jörg Widmer's (The Tree of Life) cinematography is stunning, there's no arguing about that, and with James Newton Howard's absolutely magical strings-heavy score playing in the background, you can mostly just sit back and enjoy what's on screen. What also helps is the quality of sound, that just seeps like warm butter into your ears. It makes up for a disappointing story that could've been told in a simpler way, without losing the sheer brilliance of Malick's admirable style of filmmaking.The acting ensemble, mostly driven by Diehl and Pachner's undeniably natural chemistry, isn't anything remarkable. You'll believe them as peasant farmers, but other than that, the film never feels authentic in its time period, solely because it's set in an environment that is so distant from the real world, besides the scenes that take place in prison. The moral of Malick's story is so stretched out, it loses the core essence on the unbreakable bond of family and religion, to a slowly faltering yet pompous way of showing how lost a director can get in his own form of art. Without any emotional pay off in a film that has been set up so dramatically, what's even the point?!",A Hidden Life

As I've sat through movies up to five hours long, it wasn't due to my attention span. This film did not need to be three hours long. It would have been much more solid at maybe two hours.Certain things work: the strong acting, the cinematography, the breathtaking Austrian locales, and the parallels to the United States under President Donald Trump. What keeps A HIDDEN LIFE from being a modern classic are the quick cuts, the artsy-fartsy touches, the heavy-handed religiosity, the turgid pace, and the sheer length of it.While Franz Jägerstätter's story deserved to be told on film, it also deserved a much leaner and more straightforward treatment than writer/director Terrence Malick gave it.",A Hidden Life
48,isaacsundaralingam,Malick and Longsuffering,10,30 July 2021,"Going into a Terrence Malick movie, there already is this expectation of what you're about to experience, and everything else add on to that. And that is exactly the way it is in A Hidden Life; a movie about how far one can go to stay true to his ideals.Objectively looking, the movie has very little going on. But that's sort of the point. Because the battles of this movie are not the ones on screen but those behind it. What we see are merely the reactions and the consequences of the battles the protagonist Franz fights within himself. And the world around him is nothing but the externalities of his faith.A Hidden Life is such a beautifully made movie and there is no denying that. Every frame is one of such peace and tranquility, and at the same time, one of woe and doubt. It is in itself a soul cleansing experience; one that everyone should witness at least once.

Strangely, they don't appear to rate very well here on IMDb at 6.8, 5.9 and 7.4 respectively but I rate them all much higher.I am a keen photographer, always have been, and I find Malick's movies just gorgeous to look at. Sumptuously beautiful. Every shot is framed and lit to perfection. His extensive use (via his cinematographers) of wide angle close-ups is most impressive.The narrative style of his works is wonderful and Mr Malick also seems to have the ability to bring the very best out of the actors he works with. Clearly he is a perfectionist but I'm sure they would all find him a pleasure to work with during filming.Even at nearly three hours' running time, A Hidden Life truly is a masterpiece in the same way that The Tree Of Life was also.

Think about it, Franz Jägerstätter refused to say the oath and finally became a martyr because he wanted to : 1. not commit himself (even just verbally) to an evil cause and 2. avoid not the imminence of doing evil, but just the possibility of killing someone or letting someone die in front of his eyes. Or later, even more impressive, when he was offered the job as a doctor, he refused it not because of reason no. 2, but solely based on reason no. 1! He had to endure such a tragic end because he couldn't let go of his tenet, his reason no. 1.

It's off putting, to say the least. Third, shy and unsatisfying points on the catholic church's disagreements with the nazi party. So timid, I'm sure some viewers would end up with the wrong idea anyway. These faults are almost enfuriating because they're cultural misconceptions that hurt directly the main point on faith, good and resistance.

But the main flaw of the movie for me, the one that created a big disconnect from minute one was to see the actors playing in English; in the context of such a poetic, hyper realistic type of movie, the least thing you would expect is to find Austrian peasants and Nazi soldiers speaking English. The effect was for me as if the actors were telling me: ""Ha-ah, we are not the real characters, we don't even speak their language; we are just actors playing them in a movie.""

He has now brought us the wonderful ""A Hidden Life"".Based on real events; August Diehl (Inglourious Basterds) stars as Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian farmer whose tranquil life with his family was fractured by him being drafted to fight for the Nazis in World War Two. We're taken on his journey as he must stand by his religious beliefs and moral opposition to them, and his family faces persecution from fellow neighbors of their tight-knit village. On that note, the Catholic beliefs of him and his wife are highlighted in a positive light in this story, which is perfectly welcome.The technical aspects of this movie are grade A+; the immersive cinematography, score and immaculate sound design. One can see this film having elements of a few of Malick's previous films; the rural landscapes of ""Days of Heaven"", the World War Two setting of ""The Thin Red Line"", and beautiful yet bittersweet family dynamics (""The Tree of Life"").If you're not a fan of Terrence Malick, then this probably won't do much for you.

70,d_carlotaj,Malick Makes Movie Magic,10,30 August 2020,"""A Hidden Life,"" (2019). Starring August Diehl, Valerie Pachner, and Matthias Schoenaerts. Directed By Terrence Malick. What a wonderful, sad, heart rending story. While it is almost three hours long, the length symbolizes the long, laborious ordeal that Franz endures. An ordeal foisted on him by an evil subversion of his homeland by Nazism. One which Franz finds he cannot be silent about. He becomes a conscientious objector. The plot of this story revolves around various people trying to help Franz see impact his actions have on himself, his family, and countrymen. And various seats of authority, a bishop, the mayor, elders, and others, cannot dissuade Franz. Franz and Fani are so in love, they cannot keep their hands off each other and never miss an opportunity to express themselves. Fani is the reason that Franz does not want to go to the front lines. But the best of these efforts is the scenes of Captain Herding played by Matthias Schoenaerts. It is apparent that he sympathizes with Franz when he tells him, ""An antichrist will use your virtues to mislead you."" An outstanding performance.
This movie is similar to The Jack Bull and Age of Uprising: Legend of Michael Kohlhaas, all leading characters refusing to be broken. The cinematography and art production are so excellent.

71,michaeldoud,First Hit: A long and beautifully shot study about how one man wouldn't compromise his beliefs.,6,1 January 2020,"First Hit: A long and beautifully shot study about how one man wouldn't compromise his beliefs.Terrence Malick creates and makes statements in his films. Often, the films are long, always beautifully shot, and require the audience to think about the point he's making.In this movie, the focus is on living and acting on your beliefs. Franz Jagerstatter (August Diehl) was profoundly religious and had a personal relationship with his idea of God, Christ, and what was right and wrong. He was faithful to the Catholic church in his tiny Austrian hillside village, called St. Radegund. As part of his commitment to the church performed duties at the church almost every day.Married to Franziska, Fani (Valerie Pachner), they began their life together, farming and then having two children. They farmed their land by hand and were an integral part of their small community. During harvest season, the community worked together to bring in and store the harvested crops. The town felt like it was a long way from the war that Hitler was bringing to the world. However, when the war started turning against Hitler, the army drafted all eligible men to serve the Third Reich. This included Franz.A requirement for serving the German Army was to sign a pledge of allegiance to Hitler and the German government. Franz couldn't do this. He could not live with himself if he signed something that was against what he believed, and after the army attempted to persuade him with physical and verbal abuse, they threw him in jail. The German officers even solicited the assistance of his local priest to convince him to sign the oath of loyalty. In essence, the priest was saying that God would overlook his signing the document to save his own life and the life of his family.He couldn't and wouldn't sign the oath and therefore spent years in jail. But Franz wasn't the only one who paid the price, so did Fani. In scenes back in the village, Fani and the girls are depicted being shunned by almost everyone in the village because her husband Franz was giving their town a bad name in the eyes of ruling Germany.The film spends time going back and forth between Franz in prison being harassed and beaten into signing a loyalty oath and the village where Fani and the girls were continuing to be harassed by the people in her town.The immense pressure building up in Franz didn't break him down and his wife, despite the immense movement to ostracize her and the girls, continued to support him and his decision despite what she was going through.This film shows the cruelty of people when someone stands up for their beliefs. Because the people, including the priest, are unwilling to stand for their true feelings, they make Franz and Fani the enemy.The physical beauty of the area of the village was well captured by the cinematographer. The integration of archival footage of Adolf Hitler and the huge parades he commanded was well done.Diehl was terrific as Franz. His ability to show his internal struggle in a contained, in prison, way was perfect. Pacher was sublime. Her looks of intensity and passion towards other characters , amazing. Michael Nyqvist's performance as the local Bishop that tried to persuade Franz to sign the document was excellent. Alexander Radszun's performance as the judge that sentenced Franz to death was very good. You could see that he understood and struggled but had to follow his own loyalty oath. Malick wrote a script that was too long. I think the film could have had a stronger impact if it was more crisp in its presentation.Overall: Long and pretty, it needed to be tightened up to make its point even stronger.",A Hidden Life

Shows a strength of characters and how can people can endure everything for what they believe in and stand up for themselves without being blind and obedient without questioning.A must watch and disregard low rating reviews, because they can handle only 10s of attention to one point and have no patience or true interest to see how things will unfold. Nor they appreciate the art and nature. This movie is a refined and polished gem.",A Hidden Life

Any country will crucify soldiers that do not carry the wishes of politicians, so its not specific to nazis, they were just most extreme. I did not think that there were so many discussions with him as the nazis killed indiscriminately for any reason, maybe because he was Austrian which was a german ally. It also shows the group mentality which turned the whole town into nazis. Hopefully they were dealt with after they lost the war. He could have fled or hidden out and have some plan to survive, I dont know if his defiant statement changed anything.

75,arkif1,"Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain.",8,4 February 2020,"One problem of A Hidden Life is that at no point did I think that on the other side of the mountains it's 1943. Actually, not even 1983 would have been believable. Sadly, you can tell from the way the actors speak that it must be 2010+. So there is no real immersion in terms of historicity.Still there is some sort of immersion here all right, just no historical one. It's a psychological one, I guess, the idea of being free, once you don't care about your own survival anymore. That clicked. Of course this is ethically wrong, similar to the hallucinations of a man dying in the ice or the desert. Prayer would have been more adequate, though possibly also more painful.Yet there is a strange thing here: Very few people these days seem to grasp the idea that part of the deal you signed when your creator gave you life is that you have to obey your conscience. I find that worrisome. I can understand if a person thinks ""Who cares about words? I can start disobeying orders any time I want to."" if the pledge is forced on him. But I find it worrisome that conscience doesn't seem to be recognized as an obligation these days. It seems to have been replaced by ""give and take"", and a discussion of A Hidden Life will bring this swiftly to the surface.Anyway, however feeble the resistance, however reliant on psychological evasion tactics, it serves to remind the common man that there are things that can't be controlled by brute force and that does give great comfort to the common man, as Albert Pike pointed out in his magnum opus. Here, in this film, it allows a village to return to decency. But of course the reality of the Hitlerian intoxication is quite different from the brutish melodrama depicted here. It's arrogant, cynical, daring. The great game. Whatever abuse would have occurred in an Austrian village, it would have been born out of the nastiness of Austrian villagers without any outside help. I'm afraid that part of the film is almost cringeworthy.But I forgive that. Pike isn't completely wrong. That area of hallucination close to death, remembering episodes from one's life, seeing the moment through the eyes of someone from an earlier time, it tells us something about us, doesn't it? Perhaps that it would be a folly to let us be reduced to the current moment? As if nothing else mattered? There is a treasure of forms that makes our lives. And sometimes someone has to say: ""Can't touch this."" to remind us of it.Yet, that is not the full extent of possible, well, shall we say metaphysical interference? That'd be more like ""You shall taste it.""",A Hidden Life

77,Brantford_Mark,An Inspirational Starting Point for Understanding a Saintly Human Being,7,26 July 2021,"Every day you learn something new is a good day. Yesterday I learned about a saintly Austrian conscientious objector Franz Jägerstätter, who refused to serve in Hitler's WWII army. Terrence Malick's film, ""A Hidden Life"" got lost in the midst of COVID. It premiered in Dec 2019 and by February 2020 was starting to open in theatres. We all know what happened next. Found it on a streaming service. Lush photography, a beautiful soundtrack of classical pieces, and outstanding performances.Such a profound and inspiring story that I dug further into it. Turns out the famous monk Thomas Merton was also inspired by him and included his story in the 1968 book Faith and Violence. Although writer/director Malick is known for his impressionistic style (Thin Red Line, Days of Heaven), it strikes me that he deliberately secularized the life of the deeply devout Jägerstätter. No mention of his having sought a Papal blessing after his marriage, his membership in the Franciscan Third Order, or his beatification as a Catholic martyr in 2007 by Pope Benedict. My guess is that it was an effort to make the film more commercial.By doing this, Malick obscured the true motivation of the protagonist and denied his audience access to the real meaning of his sacrifice. I do understand that he was not doing a documentary in the traditional sense, but believe he was obligated to be more expository in depicting the life story of such a heroic figure. Hinting at significant aspects of Jägerstätter's life or portraying them without providing context robbed the film of a fair amount of its power. In particular, the meeting with his local bishop about his crisis of conscience has much more meaning if you understand that he was doing so as a Franciscan. While the scenery of the Alpine village and the bucolic farmwork scenes had some relevance, there was far too much of it. I agree with another reviewer that Malick could have trimmed 30 minutes of this material without compromising it as a work of art.The film's title comes from a passage by George Eliot in which he notes that the world becomes a better place through the accumulated grace from many ""hidden"" lives. While the film was a grueling and difficult march through one such life, it was a worthwhile introduction to one of humanity's best.",A Hidden Life

His resistance emerged from his deep Christian faith, which Malick brilliantly contextualizes in the breathtaking natural environment, the dignity of human labor, and a loving family. This is a very long movie, with many landscapes and images of village homes, the church, farm-work, and prisons. These images show us the whole life-world within which Franz made his choice.

My biggest complaint is: It should have been done in German with English subtitles. Most of the actors were either German or Austrian so it begs the question, why wasn't the script written in German. It's a story of an Austrian. Everyone in Austria speaks German. It took away from the story, and as one other review stated, one could not truly connect to the actors.

The from time to time beautiful landscape scenes offer no explanation or are unrelated to the story. The length and pace of the movie shows poor editing skills, its repetitive, without direction.

81,Lepidopterous_,Transcendent. A truly spiritual film,10,11 November 2019,"""Better to suffer injustice than to do it...""I don't have many words tonight. A lot of thoughts and emotions. I didn't expect a perfect score from me this year, but I am just floored and overwhelmed by the visual poetry and spiritual magnitude of it all. It feels transcendent. With a beauty that permeates all the way to one's own relationship with God.Based on true events, A Hidden Life is Malick's most direct exploration of faith since To the Wonder, and perhaps his most fully realized work yet. It is an allegorical story about a man of extraordinary faith. A real-life parable of perseverance and free will. A spiritual journey centered in not just our humanity, but on what it means to truly walk the steps of Christ. And on what it means to choose what we believe is right and just, when we are given every reason not to.Malick doesn't glorify the central character's ideals or deeds. Rather we focus on the humble threads of love and the storm they weather--and the romantic chemistry is perfect. August Diehl & Valerie Pachner are both exceptional and so incredibly in love. Seconds into the film and you already know it. Pachner gives a particularly moving performance deserving of an Oscar nomination (she is in SF this week doing Q&A's!). Every touch, glance, or embrace between these two is personal, powerful, believable. You can see the stress leave their shoulders each time they first see each other. Sincerity fills the screen as their thoughts, worries, desires, and personal bond resurface in the context of God.The cinematography is superb, with DP notably credited to Jörg Widmer and not Emmanuel Lubezki. There is a rare seamless quality achieved blending in old footage as well as in choosing to entirely forgo subtitles in a film spoken in equal parts English and German. The music is the best I've heard all year. A beautiful traditional theme by James Newton Howard (Blood Diamond, TDK) with Handel, Dvorak, and other great classical works mixed in.A Hidden Life is a film that may stay with you for some time. This is quintessential Malick, joining the ranks of The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life. Go in with an open mind and heart, ready for a spiritual experience.",A Hidden Life

It is one of the most grim, harrowing, mournful films I have ever seen (it should be rated R)-and it is absolutely masterful.
I can't even find words to properly describe it. This is a film that you enter, that you experience, you almost feel like you're watching a documentary. Malick's direction is absolutely one of a kind, brilliant, almost spiritual. The acting is phenomenal-August Diehl is terrific, and Valerie Pachner is spectacular, along with excellent supporting performances from all. The cinematography is astounding; jaw-droppingly gorgeous (either this or 1917 for best cinematography of the year), and James Newton Howard's score is beautiful. But what sets this film apart is its emotional brutality- it is heartbreaking, grim, and absolutely brutal. And yet, throughout all of this, the courage, faith and bravery of Franz and his wife, not to mention their three little girls and Franz's mother-is incredibly overwhelming.

87,sdavid-41660,A Wasted Life,5,13 September 2020,"Everyone agrees that at nearly three hours, this fraud of a film is far too long. Most of it plays like a travelogue to visit picturesque Bavaria. What little story there is tells the tale of a German farmer who refuses on moral grounds to pledge allegiance to Hitler and join the German army. For his defiance he and his wife, children, mother and sister-in-law are ostracized in their small mountain village, he is sent to prison, beaten, and finally executed for his treason. His protest served no purpose whatsoever except to cost him his life and ruin the lives of his family that he purported to love. But he was selfishly determined to stand by his principles no matter who he hurt or what the cost. He obviously never learned the lesson that you should pick and choose only fights you can win - or at least have a chance to win. He picked the wrong fight.At one point his exasperated wife, and later his lawyer, asks him why not fulfill his duty to the state and serve in a hospital instead of on the battlefield. He has no answer. He could have recited the words to a loyalty oath without meaning them, and by working in a hospital for the duration of the war, help save lives and ease suffering. Then, when the war ended, he would have lived to one day walk his daughters down the aisle, bounce their children on his knee, and grow old together with his wife.But the film was not only infuriating at watching him stubbornly cling to his pointless protest. It was also infuriating that, when he talked to the few people who would listen about examples of the terrible evils the Nazis were committing, not once was the word Jew mentioned. Evidently a three hour movie with very little dialogue was not long enough to include the unprecedented industrial extermination of an entire people as figuring into his calculus, or evil enough to be worthy of his sacrifice.Zero stars for the film, but five for a haunting musical score by James Newton Howard.",A Hidden Life

This happened fairly smoothly and is now known as the 'Anschluss' (joining of Austria and Germany).This slow paced story is based on true events, meaning that this story is a depiction of how people lived and thought in 1940s Austria, how the life in a small, secluded mountain village was, how radical ideas from abroad changed the minds of this once united farmers community, and how they got sucked into a huge War that actually wasn't theirs.In such a small village, a simple farmer is forced to make a choice between following these radical and extreme ideas of the new order, stay neutral or simply choose the opposite. He will soon find out that he doesn't actually have a choice: Either go with the flow, or be exiled, boycotted, what we now call 'cancelled'. Both sides pray to the same god in the same church, but his family isn't welcome anymore. Even the church has no choice: Submit or get a one-way ticket to the concentration camps. The farmer is imprisoned for refusing to enlist. After some years however, when the farmer is sentenced to death, villagers slowly turn around and start reconciling with the family.This World War II story is the typical 'history repeats itself' example, and it can't be more present-day in 2020: We forgot, learned nothing and created the same situation that gave Hitler momentum.",A Hidden Life

I do not need to see buildings blown up to be entertained but just coming in under 3 hours we see a bit too much pacing around, vacant staring and clawing at the earth for my liking. However, it can be said that it adds to the agonising battle that he and his family must have gone through at this time. Perhaps this was the director's aim.It's noticable that he was one of the very few of his faith that was willing to die for his beliefs. Even the movie portrays he gets no help from the church or his fellow parishioners. However, history records that Jehovah's Witnesses took a stand en masse and many were sent to concentration camps and exterminated. I think I read somewhere that apart from the Jews they were the most persecuted group, numbers wise. Doesn't look like anyone has done a film about them. Perhaps it wouldn't be such good viewing.

96,mike_diamond,Another masterpiece from Malick,8,13 June 2020,"Terrence Malick's A Hidden Life stars August Diehl as Franz, a Catholic farmer who refuses to serve the nazis during WWII. Franz and his wife Fani (Valerie Pancher), along with their three daughters, his mother, and her sister, live a pastoral life in the Austrian countryside; scything the fields, tending livestock, and attending church. They frolic in the tall grass and chase baby pigs. Their lives are idyllic. When Austria is annexed in 1938 and Franz is drafted in 1943, he is expected to join the war effort. He's spent these years contemplating the war and chooses to conscientiously object. Refusing the nazis is a jail sentence and Franz is spirited away from his family and bucolic existence. What's unique about a Hidden Life is that Franz's moral position is scarcely explored. What's investigated, at a nearly three hour runtime, are the consequences and resolve of Franz's decision. In true Terrence Malick fashion, the dialogue is sparse, deferring to the imagery to tell the story. The film is mostly shot on 12mm, creating an ethereal feel of the panoramic landscapes and forces the camera in very close when filming the characters. This intimacy allows the picture to illustrate his choice of imprisonment over the agrarian home-life of the pasture. We experience his resolve in the face of pressure from leaders, lawmakers, clergy, and family, witnessing the repercussions to both Franz and his family. We're reminded that Franz could be released at any time, if only he were to pledge his allegiance to Hitler. To a man of such resolve, martyrdom is the result of faith.",A Hidden Life

They featured beautiful nature photography and generally simple people baring their souls via narration, all wrapped up in long takes with minimal interaction between actors. I'm sorry to report that this is worse than those, because Malick has an even thinner story to tell, and with minimal exposition to boot.But the film drags terribly due to repetition (for long stretches, there's just farming to film), little interaction between characters, and laughably cartoonish depictions of every German soldier with the teensiest bit of power. On top of all that, Malick has his German and Austria farmers speak English, most Germans not engaged in conversation (usually ardent Nazis) speaking or often screaming in German, and farmer-Nazi conversations also done in English. If this wasn't Malick, the critics would have eviscerated him.But since there isn't any explanations given of who is who, what the relationships are like, and no back story, there is only the farmer's long drawn out fate to witness. No conversations about what he is doing, how it will affect his children, how it might end up being exactly a meaningless act that will lead to a life of hardship for his family. How about this terse, harsh summary: Austrian farmer objects to taking Nazi oath, is imprisoned and never sees his wife and children again, and eventually is unceremoniously killed by his jailers.

Otherwise the film becomes riddled by incomprehensible dialogues and, in my own view, shows an open disregard for the real facts and protagonists. Austrian people. The tradition in WWII mainstream movies is not to the translate German military voices, as a way to dehumanize the enemy. This movie is out of that tradition. Its aim is to reflect the suffering of the German people, through a well known Austrian historic figure that represents a personal stance of radical (religious based) peaceful disobedience against Hitler´s regime.
The movie is long, really hash and desolate. Full with both Bible quotes and inner reflection. Many parts are voiceover letters.The soundtrack is mixed with a masterful use of total or partial silence; different mixed noises; sometimes crafted with literary like W.

In a world dominated by a pervasive Evil that that has almost defeated God, in a beautiful world made of bright green and mountains shrouded in clouds, but whose sky is almost always full of black, threatening clouds, Franz and Fani are a Edenic couple who live a life of joy and hard work on the land.

Based on letters written between a husband and wife while he is in jail for being a conscientious objector in Hitler's Austria.

108,mikekisil,"What happened to the Terence Malick who made ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven""?",2,17 January 2020,"Malick's latest takes 173 minutes to tell a 90 minute story. With sledgehammer tactics he tells the story of an Austrian farmer who refused to give an oath of allegiance to Hitler during the Second World War and the consequences of the act of principle.
It looks brilliant and you can easily believe the farming life lead by the two main characters and the conflict caused by the farmer's stand not just between him and his wife but also against the community around him who,pragmatically,adopt Nazism in order to get on with their lives.
But the over-use of the ""fish-eye"" lens and the excessive mobile camerawork really makes the camera a character in the storytelling and that really is distracting. And the constant voiceovers depicting conversations between husband and wife when the one is incarcerated and the other is truly lumbered with trying to run a hill farm with rapidly diminishing livestock and three young girls chosen for their unchanging, angelic, good looks and not their ability to help the mother in the most trying of circumstances.
The film purports to tell a true story. What I found amazing was that husband and wife could exchange letters with exceptional regularity given that they were in a most brutal war and secondly, that the Nazis are here depicted as a tolerant bunch who allowed this ""good"" man to last as long as he did without ""disappearing"".
Oh, and in the final section you might need to have a smattering of German as someone forgot to add subtitles in the key trial scene.",A Hidden Life

114,ewanfortune,Important,9,17 January 2020,"A Hidden Life isn't for everyone but it feels important. It's almost 3 hours long and moves at a slow pace. However, I feel this works to the films benefit. It gives time to the two main characters, who are husband and wife, to really develop. These characters are Franz and Fani Jagerstatter, played excellently by August Diehl and Valerie Pachner. I felt invested in them and in their relationship, particularly the last time we see them together, when you really feel their love for each other.Generally, the movie is very dark and you feel angry at most of the characters. ""Don't they know evil when they see it?"" one person remarks early on and that quote is relevant throughout the entire runtime. From ordinary farmers to guards to priests, nobody except for Franz stands up against Hitler's regime, fighting for what he believes is right. His faith in God goes unshaken the whole film. His tale is very human, and he represents the best of humanity. Surrounded by people who have allowed themselves to be brainwashed, he resists and suffers. While he's off in various prisons, Fani is at home in the village with her sister, taking care of their three daughters and she also suffers. She has to put up with abuse from her neighbours all because Franz won't fight. Despite this, she stands by his decision in the end. As her father puts it, ""Better to suffer injustice than to do it."" A quote that would make the world a better place if we were to follow it.The movie is inspiring. It's a good movie about a brave man and shines a light on a part of World War 2 that we rarely, if ever, see represented in cinema. Complementing this are the beautiful locations and fantastic cinematography. There are many moments where you could just pause the movie and whatever's on screen looks like a painting. The score by James Newton Howard also adds to what you're seeing on screen. A movie that both celebrates faith while depicting a tragic love story, it's emotionally draining but easily worth viewing.",A Hidden Life
115,dzhaviland,Man's inhumanity to man,9,26 November 2020,"The large story here is the true story of a simple farmer who stood up against the Nazi regime and refused to fight. The real story is how the greater evil filters down to all who are touched by it, filtering to each soul to some extent. How much it filters and taints is the true subtext of this movie. It shows the extent humans will rationalize and deny an evil reality in order to move on with their lives and how, once they have made the choice to bend to evil, their shame and guilt compels them to make others submit to the same choice to rid themselves of their shame and guilt. It also shows how a ""mob mentality"" is not just something that happens in purely violent situations but happens in everyday life, something that hits home with what's happening in the US today. This movie is a long watch and is not filled with overtly dramatic scenes. It focuses on the simplicity of life and love, the effects of love and evil on each person and how both can transform people.Many will not like it because it makes you examine your own soul, what choice you would make. Will you justify evil in small ways or large in order to continue to live your ""comfortable"" life? How much will you allow evil to change you, will you rationalize and persecute those around you who choose a different path?

117,beginasyouare,Great spiritually themed WWII time period movie,8,20 February 2021,"Great spiritually themed WWII time period movie of a family farming in a small village in Austria when war breaks out. Gorgeous scenery. Much of the story remains in that home, land and with the local people, the rest takes place in prison situations. One of Terrence Malick's best. The main character Franz Jägerstätter was recognized by the Catholic Church as a blessed which means ""those who have lived in the fame of sanctity or died as martyrs"". His wife was very heroic also, she stood by Franz even though at first she did not share his point-of-view, and she stuck with their family home amidst the hardship and ridicule. Only two things of which I didn't care for: one is the use of super wide angle lens for the entire film. The lens distortion is less than pleasant for an entire movie, especially when panning, and it isn't kind to faces, though great with landscapes and covering tight room shots. Second thing: a sometimes excessive use of slow moving plot. Of course I'm sure other's disagree on the plot speed and will say it sets a mood or tone and it adds rather than detracts and for part of the film the slower pace was fine but it was used throughout, at times you feel like you are riding on a glacier or watching grass grow, typical of Malick. That's how I knew it was his movie before reading about who created it. Other than that it's a great film, worth watching, even repeatedly. It has a very heroic theme and is a very inspirational biography drama. Recommended.",A Hidden Life
118,Rosebud815,A Hidden Life (2019): The Transcendence of Dignity and the Act of Reflecting Heaven Back upon the Earth,10,17 January 2020,"In Terrence Malick's world, the Earth - broadly, nature - is its own being in which we exist. His traditional philosophical definition of hard work (harvesting, making your own life in nature) initially explored in Days of Heaven has spotlight again here. Peace and happiness, love, the plentiful bounty of the Earth for humanity's taking and rejoicing within and without. And somehow, in just as breathtaking of a display, in just as lyrically romantic a form as Days of Heaven. Here we see the wide angles close to the characters face, the edges of the lens curving the character into their environment which immerses, withholds them (and us). Its ways, its energy is written in the DNA of Franz and Fani, their own morals and way of life--a loving relationship, a happy home. Pure presence in living. A true Christian existence if there ever was one. The characters' voices, so poetic and visceral as the speak their letters to each other, their emotions: ""We lived above the clouds."" More than anything, A Hidden Life is about the eternality of feeling heaven and maintaining it--if impossible without (as it was not in the beginning), then keeping it within. For it is an eternal experience, as Franz finds in opposition to the Nazis, a truly free one, to surrender to his own nature and what feels right to him. He narrates, ""Once you give up surviving at any cost, another door opens..."" The weight is lifted. Faith, an other-knowledge, the sun which still shines behind the tempest. Though utterly painful and ripping in every way possible--physical, mental--Franz knows his sentiment of love and life and literally acting this out--not cowardly holding it within while your conscience eats away at you--is one that can never die, for it speaks to nature itself. We see this reflected in the joyousness of Franz and Fani's love and family. When the Nazis come in, when the darkness takes over, the Earth itself changes. The clouds swirl and blacken, lighting strikes, thunder sounds. Though nature does not alter itself to humanity's choices, its indifference is a harsh one which allows humans to face the darkness their species has created. It is an all-knowing indifference.The real historical footage of the Nazi movement in the beginning--later cross-cut with Franz's dark dreams and transportation--cuts like a blade to the heart. No wonder Malick spent years editing this film. He slashes at the purity of Franz's love with a terror of black and white, of evil. The helplessness of it. The darkness and unconsciousness also written in human nature (Days of Heaven echoes again). And even as the fearful Austrian community ostracizes Franz's family from not volunteering or answering his call to the Nazi military, even as they take him away and attempt to manipulate, torture and destroy his will, Franz looks up to the sky in his unbroken--but tested literally as far as it can be--faith.My favorite scene in the movie is when after Franz is sentenced, after he refuses to sign the oath to Hitler that would let him go back, he is able to see his wife, Fani, one last time. Initially, in order to save his life, she asked Franz if he could answer the volunteer call - perhaps, if not to fight, then maybe he could work in a hospital, for example. For everyone knew what Franz's objections would bring--when the letter comes that he's been condemned to death, its shocking for Fani, yet in a way still not a surprise. But due to Fani's nature, the holy goodness she knows in Franz's heart, she cannot help but stand behind him. This is unspoken between them until she sees Franz before he's about to die. I want to cry just writing about it. Never before have I weeped so many times as I did at this movie. Anyways, amongst the Nazi lawyer and people still trying to convince him astray, Franz and Fani look at each other, meet each other like two reflected rays of sunlight concurrent against each other and Franz asks, ""Do you understand?"" Fani looks down, she looks back in his eyes, she nods a little, she says: ""I am always with you. No matter what happens."" For with the connection the lovers are a part of, the freedom they know within and without, they have found the timelessness of existence. And the further transcendence in Franz's pain, his dignity, highlights this to the extreme, when they are faced to lose what they always loved and they know they have never, will never lose it.The heaven written in us and what we are connected to is love's manifestation in spirit. That is there without Franz and Fani and in them. And it is in the hills, the mountains and their serene, powerful curves of emotion. They are the mote and not the mote.Franz and Fani's voices reading their letters back to one another during his incarceration serve the poetry in the martyrdom of the film--Jesus' real struggle, even though the Nazi's perpetuate Christianity, a very interesting statement which Malick makes through his characters of the church followers getting 'sympathy' from their religion without following the teachings. For if the townspeople understood the responsibility of uncowardly preserving love wherever they can, deciphering what has happened to their world, they would know the struggle of Jesus and Franz. In his hushed conversations with the other objector in his village, Franz's parallels of Hitler to the antichrist and of the Nazi regime of the beginning of the Christian-prophetized end of the world are interesting--it is a direct statement from Malick of God's, of nature's will broken, of a virtually unstoppable evil rising on this planet. Yet the freedom of resistance. These pressures--however little each of them, however massive--of conformity through fear, of anti-consciousness on Franz and his family's happiness, love and free will are all too real to human life then, now and much before. Look at how when Franz gets to higher and higher officers that try to convince him to fight, they are still plagued by the questions Franz is asking, what they--if they're being honest--initially felt and still feel. Unanswered questions that never stop biting deep inside. They have no answer, they cannot compute the will of Franz beyond them, they become frightened, they ask, ""What good are you doing? It doesn't make a difference you resisting, does it? It doesn't help anyone?"" Just as the Nazi mayor of the town became frightful of how the Nazis may punish him for allowing the breeding of a consciencious objector in his sect.A Hidden Life includes us in its undying beauty, begs us to feel our own nature through Franz's family's love and peace in those lush, vivid green hills in their fog below the mountains. ""We lived above the clouds,"" is perhaps our most direct parallel to heaven in the film. Franz's narration in the beginning mentions how he thought they could live in the isolation, the seclusion of the mountain and be untouched by the encroaching evil. Yet, Malick forces us to catharcize the ongoing failure of humanity to live in peace, and makes us realize something greater in nature: that every heaven will be ripped away somehow, in sometime, that perhaps the greatest part of being alive is to know how to not die in living--to transcend. In love and in pain. Malick speaks to the painfulness of the heaven you can feel of being alive on this Earth--this rare, rare, precious condition in space--and the hell of what this species has created for itself. The animalness of it.I am an emotional wreck after seeing this movie. It rips my heart out in conveyal of the immortal peace I know, then repeatedly and fittingly so attempts to take it away--as the Nazis to do Franz in--and gives us the courage to hold onto it in onslaught of those painstakingly real omnipresent dogmas and pressures that destroy peace in existence by their perpetuation. The resistance, the fight, is our struggle and our duty to ourselves as it is to what made us--the powers of creation. In the expression of free truth there is no dying, only returning, ascending back to this for it is what we are. Like how the orthodx Hindu considers the experience of 'Self,' the spirit, a mere extension and direct inclusion of the timeless natural creator, both beyond and within us--only of the 'one breath' this film refers to. Our morals, ideals are written in our nature as humans just as our body is. A Hidden Life evokes something that I feel as deep as possible in my body, from my feet to my mind. Something body and mind create and share together in this unique experience. Both preserving and acting upon this is the purpose of life, a drive with no fear of death and no end--for it is for something much greater than a single life. And it is the greatest solace in a plight-filled, degrading world to be able to continue to feel this. It is feeling God and reflecting Heaven back onto Earth. Though we must remember that beyond any ideal, beyond any human construct of thought, Christ's mythical/legendary dilemma on the cross was to fight for who he was: God's son, though asked to renounce this. Like Franz, he was utterly free in his action from what he continued to feel, to protect inside. A Christian understanding that speaks much more to a faith bigger than any single religion, to the experience we know by being alive, that we hopefully continue be true to with the strength of whatever you call it--God, Brahman, etc. The force of the eternal, the creator within, who in life giveth and taketh away.",A Hidden Life

People can SAY good holy things, but in their heart well. heh.LOTS of people were consciencious objectors. From how I saw this, especially at the end when Fani was there in the prison, it was PRIDE on the part of Franz, why he wouldn't sign that paper and go free, remain a father to his kids, a husband to his wife. Pure pride. Fani says ""whatever you want"" or whatever but obviously she is lying because she is angry kicking at the fence.What a WASTE of a life, imo. Nothing holy about it, but perhaps a display of wrong headed religiousity.Oaths. Lots of people swear oaths to uphold the constitution and then go raising money to bail out criminals so that they can go do crimes again.No, for me, this was a study in foolish PRIDE, so proud that he threw his life and his family away.I am glad it was dubbed, I wish ALL of it was, not just part.

First two hours show his own struggle with these beliefs, that collide with his village surroundings, where society is trying to force him to do ""the right thing for the fatherland and family"". With few exceptions, he and his wife are being bullied by the villagers, who think he's a coward trying to escape responsibility. When villagers start greeting with ""Heil Hitler!"", his righteousness impulsively reacts with ""Pfui Hitler!"". Even the mayor is taking his time, to convince him otherwise (because he might be also blamed). Farmer tries to find advice from the local priest, that sends him further to the bishop, who is also explaining the duty to the fatherland from the Bible. Farmer is convinced, the clergy is afraid to agree with him what's right. And he's obligated to decline unright.
Until this point movie is somewhat repetitive, slow, almost boring, and with known Malick rhythm makes the viewer drowsy. Some in the audience left the screening. If the whole story ended after two hours, it would be a very good movie. Yet it goes on for another 45 minutes, so one has to struggle to wait and see what happens to the farmer.Farmer could ask to work in infirmary as a nurse, but he'd still have to swear allegiance to Hitler, that he doesn't want to. So, he's treated as a deserter and a traitor, and put in front of a tribunal, that sentences him to death. Whole emotional value of the movie concentrates in the scene, where wife and local priest visit him before execution and priest asks him to swear to Hitler, because God only considers what is one's true belief in the heart, not what they say. Farmer can't accept that as an honest choice. Many males in the audience secretly wiped their tears.
Movie shows farmer's way to the execution and supporting wife's struggles, to keep the farm going, to provide for three daughters. She says she's going to meet her beloved husband in the beautiful mountains in the afterlife. At the time of the execution, a sympathetic friend of the family rings the bell, to announce conscience of the village had perished.Malick ends the movie with written praise to many anonymous honest men, that with their personal struggles, mostly unknown, made living more bearable for the everyman in the modern world (if noone ever demanded civil over military service, conscientious objections still wouldn't be considered today). Movie starts with ""based on a true story"", and it would be interesting to know, whether it is based on the letters correspondence between the spouses, as it often seems so during the movie.

134,MouazHajBakri,"A human story unhidden by a poetic, enthralling, heart-wrenching, and purposefully unforgettable picture",9,5 January 2020,"A Hidden Life, written and directed by Terrence Malick is yet another marvelous gem in this unforgettable year in cinematic achievements. However, this statement wouldn't be fair for this particular movie, as its without a doubt one of the best in the 20 years of the 21st century. Malick is an extremely unique and visionary director, a deduction that can be quickly made even after watching only one of his pictures. I have seen only two, this and Tree of Life. Tree of life is also hailed by critics as one of the greatest achievements in this century, but that was not apparent to me when I watched it on my small laptop screen in 2012; So it must be mentioned that Malick's style is meditative and poetic, something that can feel like an extremely challenging yoga class, its slow, can be ""boring"", yet to some who adore it, can be the favorite training style. However, there are two specific differences that must be made regarding this particular picture. First, the story is more concise and focused. Few tangible characters in a limited life span with a particular story and very well specified impacts and messages; this (along with flawless performances and mesmerizing cinematography) made this 3 hours picture much more captivating, especially in comparison with the longest this year, the Irishman (yep, it was too long to me). Secondly, A Hidden Life is an important human story that by itself is a much-needed testament about the unsung heroes of history.A Hidden life is an epic, its very hard to justly praise its alluring cinematography, genius editing, intimate storytelling, heavy monologues, and its impeccable performances. Much can be said and studied but will focus here (especially for personal attachments) to the story itself.The film follows the life of an Austrian farmer that defiantly chose not to be forced to join the Nazi army during WWII. It follows the simple yet precious life that he had with his loving wife, his beautiful 3 little girls, their wheat fields, their barns and farms and cattle in the heaven-like Austrian countryside, their small warm house, and the cherished memories of their lives. Malick undeniably was intensely passionate about drawing the life that was. Yes, there were the hardships of the farmer's life, but (specifically the first act) didn't leave anything up its sleeves in portraying the warmness and the wholesomeness of this life. The clear cut contrast between the heavenly old days and horrors of what comes after is a dangerous tool if handled by immatures, as it can easily be drawn in a tedious and pretentious sea of melodrama. But in the hands of an experienced poet such as Terrence Malick, here, this contrast is nothing short of enchanting. This creates an extreme in the emotional, which highlights the endless sacrifices and their holiness; sacrifices that the farmer had to make so he can hold onto his humanity and identity.The second act excruciatingly draws the evading Nazi Germany into this farmer's peaceful little village. Malick tells the stories of the physical and ideological occupation of Nazism. Soldiers wander within the village taking volunteers and ensuring their constant presence, and with that, the notions of national socialism start to make their ways into the minds of everyone surrounding the farmer. Malick goes the extra mile with his emotional realism in affirming that people didn't show embracement of Nazi ideology, but were chained with the fear of tyranny, which enslaved them and tore out their sanities. This act throws the farmer and his family in a sea of discrimination and evil that creates utter solitude stretching his adamant decision not to join the army to the extreme. He finally yields and intends to join as a medical asset to avoid participation in the killing, but one thing stands in his path, which is the imposed pledge of allegiance to Hitler, which he considers as the ultimate abandonment of what makes him free.The third act, the most terrifying and torturing, acts as the utter darkness of life after the farmer's separation from his family. It follows the physical and physiological torment of imprisonment of the farmer as he was considered a ""traitor"" and the social isolation that surrounded the wife along with this act's more apparent hardships of the village life. This is the longest act in the film and has particular parts that absolutely broke me personally and brought me back to memories that actually should not be forgotten. As I was protesting against the Syrian regime, I was (as millions of Syrians) imprisoned. It was less than a month, during which some but not much affected me physically. However, two particular memories came back to me while watching the third act, one of the ""ceremony of greeting"" to the prison (which is basically to be severely hit and humiliated by tens of soldiers along your long slow path to your cell), especially when the movie used what can be described as virtual reality scene where the viewer was made to be the one who is receiving the punches and the kicks of the ruthless prison torturer. The second memory elevated this movie for me to a new level, which is of an imprisoned defected soldier who was bleeding after his long torture session, and his screams. In Syria, thousands of soldiers had defected the regime's army after it started shooting at demonstrators killing tens of thousands of them. These soldiers and their stories are not as documented or known as the other tragedies in my country, because the regime made it a quest to silently eliminate these cracks in its steely structure. The few known stories resemble the zenith of human bravery and goodness that can ever be imagined, and they are hidden from us. Thus, I finally understood the title of the movie, A Hidden life, not of the farmer's from his surroundings, but from the recorded history, and us.A certain element that threw me off for a while was the messiah complex leitmotif. The movie focused for a while on the pure Christian spirituality of the farmer and his wife, but also highlighted the inevitable doubt that can wrap the heart and shake the beliefs even of the most devoted theists in such an environment. In my opinion that was an essential part of this emotional story, but what I am hesitant in embracing is that the farmer was portrayed by others (and maybe by Malick himself) as a parallel to Jesus's biblical story, which is undoubtedly the richest and the most emotional, and it might be justified in such a theme, but there is a certain addiction to it that I didn't appreciate, however, it remains as a small and easily negligible part of this magical picture.A Hidden Life tells a story with an obvious end, but the little details are what matter because they enlighten the weight of the sacrifice on one hand, and attache it to the very meaning of humanity in the other. Malick is saying as we all should that this hidden life simply shouldn't be hidden, it should be known and celebrated and followed, it's a debt that must be repaid to those who endured it, and a promise that we need to keep to ourselves as a whole species. A hidden life is a true story, in particular with this farmer, and generally with millions of others throughout the human history of battles against tyranny, thus, Malick's picture is nothing short of one of the most important pieces of art, that must be sought and experienced by everyone.""The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs"". -George Eliot",A Hidden Life

141,adam-m-fontenot,A beautiful return to traditional narrative for Malick,9,13 December 2019,"Terrence Malick's return to narrative form was unexpected to me, but I was looking forward to this film with a lot of enthusiasm. Unfortunately, I was just about the only one. The film opened tonight at my local theater, playing on the biggest screen they have, and only about 15 others showed up to watch it with me. As this film is more conventional than his recent features, I think a mainstream audience would very much enjoy it, and so it's really too bad that it's been ignored. I encourage everyone to go see it in theaters before it's gone.Malick is still at his peak in terms of cinematography, but you might have expected his ability to get convincing performances out of actors to have waned from lack of use. Not so; while the performances are heightened to suit Malick's romantic style, they're also perfectly naturalistic whenever he needs them to be.Although we're back on the guide rails of a traditional structure, the way in which Malick tells a story has not changed. We have the same obsession with nature imagery, with numerous lengthy shots. In this case it's mostly used for the purpose of straightforward symbolism, though the film's themes make use of it as well in ways that are more subtle. That ""A Hidden Life"" follows a less experimental approach also makes it more obvious that Malick has begun to repeat himself. Viewers will recognize many shots and visual metaphors from his previous films, perhaps most directly the highly-choreographed ""couple meeting"" shot. Much of the music is reused as well, with Malick continuing his reliance on Górecki to provide emotional weight. Not that this is ineffective - the small crowd at my theater found itself in tears at several points - but I think Malick is a bit too reliant on quoting himself to get the point across, and I'd like to see something entirely fresh from him. One bright spot was in the camera work. Though we see many of the same meandering camera movements as before, it's sharply edited to direct our attention to the narrative's subjects.Surprisingly, as Malick's works (after ""Badlands"") tend to be very independent, the film reminded me of several from other directors. It's hard to imagine this film being made without Scorsese's ""Silence"" and Paul Schrader's ""First Reformed"" from the last several years. Several scenes and the use of camera angles in general owe a lot to Dreyer's ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" as well. The strongest thematic resemblance of all, in my mind, was to ""Calvary"" (2014). Even if Malick had these films in mind as he made ""A Hidden Life"", the references are limited, and he delivers something genuinely new and unique for us to appreciate.On its surface, the story is the simple one we've seen in a thousand forms. It's a story about human freedom and the responsibility that comes with it, and about what it means to be complicit. Themes like these are at the core of our understanding of people like Sophie Scholl, and they echo through our cultural memory down from the Nuremberg trials. Malick offers us something a little more subtle than that, although it's hard to notice at first. First we're asked to embrace the frailty of the human being, Franz, on the screen, and to understand him as a person who (like us) cannot see his place in history, and can only act here and now as he sees best for himself and his family. How can we understand sacrifice as a possibility if we can have no clear picture of the totality of the world in which we act?""Through faith"" seems to be the answer Franz and his wife Fani give us. They are devoted Christians, and the film's close examination of the faith they practice makes this the most explicitly religious among Malick's canon of spiritual films. Fani expresses the belief that all things will work together for their good, because they love God and endeavor to do his will. As we watch the film, it's very tempting to try to guess whether or not their trust will be rewarded. But no matter what happens in the film, we leave the theater to live - like them - lives of not-knowing, waiting, and hoping. What happens if God doesn't answer?While that possibility might seem devastating at first, Malick has something hopeful and universal to offer. We're reminded in one of Malick's trademark voiceovers that ""rain falls on the just and the unjust"", reflecting trust in ""the way of grace"" he alludes to in ""The Tree of Life"". What we see in Malick is faith that our actions will be granted meaning in history, but he offers no visible guarantor of that trust. He shows us how this kind of faith helps Franz and Fani make difficult decisions, and cope with their lives' most challenging moments. Some of us may be tempted to think that kind of simple trust simplistic, but the framing of the film doesn't give us that option. We look at their actions as readers of history. When we affirm that their lives have meaning, we validate the faith by which they led those lives.The film is a truly beautiful experience, and I urge you to see it on the biggest screen you can. While this is a relatively simple feature and occasionally self-indulgent, it's a rare treat to see the work of a great filmmaker doing what he does best. If you've been put off by Malick's previous slow-paced, more experimental films, I think you'll find this one much easier to watch. It doesn't feel its length at all (3 hours 5 minutes, according to the theater staff - possibly lengthened since it was shown in festivals), and parts of it are tightly edited enough to make my heart pound. It's a thrilling story told by our greatest creator of cinematic poetry.",A Hidden Life

Being a photographer myself, I love off centered subjects. My subject doesn't have to be right in the center of my photos and some shots were filmed in that style as well. When you see the Nazi guard yelling, there was just music so not only could you not hear the guard screaming but he was a little off to the very right of the shot. I noticed that a lot. I loved the music playing when there was no other sound to some scenes. I also love wide open shots and the mountains and green pasture scenes were magnificent, plus lovely music in the background? Wow, that was mind blowing. I didn't care if it was 3 hours long bcz I was digging the photography and very little dialogue.I am so glad the director Terence Malick spared any death camp scenes, the film was perfect without the blood and cruelty. The scenes were carefully filmed to depict life in the 40's and the beautiful old buildings, even in the downtown of cities was very realistic.The main character was a Nazi conscientious objector who could easily signed a document which could have freed him. I personally did not agree with the film and main character but the beautiful poetic reasoning being narrated quickly convinces you and you get to see it through his eyes.I highly recommend this film, even though it's long, the beautiful photography, narration and portrayal of life in the Austrian mountainside made this film an instant classic.",A Hidden Life

I thought he'd end up in one of the concentration camps, and it would be a tribute to all who died that way. Instead we're made to believe the Germans kept a full prison of able-bodied men, who were apparently punished by being made to wander aimlessly in the prison courtyard. I'm sure there were tragic circumstances where unwilling men were taken in a truck and brought to the front. And if survival instincts didn't kick in, they were shot unceremoniously on the spot. I don't think a courtroom of colonels would have a grand ceremony, giving anyone second chances. There were endless scenes of the wife working on the farm, but I couldn't help thinking it was just actresses faking the struggle with animals and plowing a field and grimacing and grunting. Yes it was an hour too long, but the real problem is the acting just couldn't hold up to scrutiny that long. They might have got away with it without drawn out pointless prison scenes. They might even had great potential, and I know other people emotionally invest and are greatly moved. They lost me in the first half.

You'll get the spacious shots of scenery that linger too long, the people frolicking while we know something ominous is coming there way, the attempt to use music to illustrate the emotional states of the characters, etc., but it will be at least one significant step down in quality, relative to his earlier, better films. So, if you haven't watched ""The Thin Red Line,"" I suggest watching that and reading about Franz Jägerstätter on Wikipedia.

165,tichy_cnp,"What Hollow Solace, Sympathy",10,24 January 2021,"Fairly early into A Hidden Life, Malick's film about the life and death of Franz Jagerstatter, we find him talking to a church painter. The man is offering support for Franz, who is wrestling with his conscience. The painter says ""the life of Christ is a command."" He laments his own cowardice, that he paints Christ as a figure of sympathy, that those looking up at the ceiling in church might feel better about themselves, believing that they would have stood up to defend Christ against the Romans. He wonders if he will ever have the courage to paint honestly.A central theme in A Hidden Life is the way we become slaves to our compromises. And how ultimately meaningless sympathy is when divorced from action. Franz becomes a criminal simply for refusing a loyalty oath to Hitler. He is told again and again how pointless his refusal is. That words are meaningless and he could simply say the oath and take a job in a field hospital where he could still be a noncombatant. He is told this by his neighbors, his priest, and by the legal and military authorities. And we can see in their pleas, a desperation, that if only he could compromise, it would validate their own compromises. That his opposition is an indictment to them.And at times Malick sits with their private suffering, these men who fail to convince Franz and so fail in convincing themselves. But their suffering, like their sympathy, is meaningless. Because these men, despite their attempts to console, continue to invest in their compromise. Their sympathy doesn't stop them from imprisoning Franz, from ultimately sentencing him to death and killing him. Ultimately sympathy is that hollow solace where we bury our heads in the sand, telling ourselves that deep down we are still good people, just victims of circumstance.Camus wrote in The Fall, ""Don't wait for the Last Judgment. It happens every day."" The loss of a soul is a death by a thousand cuts. The first is the deepest and sets the groove for all that follow. What Franz insists to us is that taking the stand against what we know to be wrong matters and if we don't take the stand at the beginning, there isn't enough left of us to take it further down the road.A Hidden Life is about the creeping corruption of fascism in a war almost no one living now remembers, but it is also a very timely reminder of the fragility of a humane world and the importance of principled action to preserve it. I found myself thinking at many times throughout the film how absurd it was to expend so much energy trying to convince a single person to give in. It betrayed their repeated arguments that Franz' protest didn't matter, that no one would ever even know he existed. Everyone wants absolution, the guilty most of all. The rest of the Camus quote is ""There are always reasons for murdering a man. On the contrary, it is impossible to justify his living. That's why crime always finds lawyers, and innocence only rarely."" We defend the good only by living it. Watch this movie. It's going to stay with me a long time.",A Hidden Life

The actors were not coached on how to farm. The cinematography was wonderful however. I'm trying to watch this movie as one who had not read the book. Since Franz is now Blessed Franz and may soon be a saint, I think that overall the movie was a disappointment and did not do him honor.",A Hidden Life
170,cmgb_02,"Quite beautiful, meaningful and moving. A real masterpiece.",10,19 August 2020,"This film is one the most moving, beautiful and inspiring pieces of art I have seen in a while.It follows Franz and Fani, a young Austrian couple, whose ordinary lives are full of joy, love and honest hard work, until World War II comes along and they are faced with the looming prospect of having to serve the nazi regime.It deals with themes of morality, community, faith, family and, most of all, love. The love this couple have for each other, for their kids, for their family members, for god and for their land. Throughout the course of this film, there is not a moment not infused with it.I cannot think of one scene I would have cut out of the 2h 54min story I have witnessed. There is no moment that is dull or unnecessary. It all serves to the story, because the story is them... The quiet moments they share, the relationship with their neighbors, the joy of playing with their daughters, the sorrow of having to say goodbye, etc.It is a beautiful examination of life, humanity and freedom. It doesn't boast with moral superiority or aims at selling you any religious agenda. Instead, it invites you to reflect, like Franz did himself -as this film is based on real people and events-, on the moral responsibility of every action we commit, even when faced with a really difficult scenario.Is this film for everyone? Probably not. But consider this: it has outstanding performances, an incredible cinematography and score and a powerful beautiful real story that deserves to be told.",A Hidden Life

173,glegotravel,Best movie of TM. True conscience has to be absolute.,10,14 February 2020,"I'm not a Christian, but I believe Franz and Fani were the only two followers of Christ in this movie.
Against the pressure of his neighbours, the villagers, his lawyer, the Nazis in many layers of society... But also his priest and his bishop (and actually the Catholic church whose leaders didn't make a stand), Franz chooses to stay true to his conscience and not give in to evil. And yet, even though it's clear how that evil has infiltrated society, and even little children are filled with hate against the children of Franz and Fani, it's shown how difficult it was to resist it. He does this - what some would call - passively. He is not fighting. He's not taking up arms. He is not even hiding in the mountains. Because he knows that this will lead to other and more evil. Christians and other religious people, you can now start religious wars about what your God or holy scriptures really meant. But for Franz it is clear. And he is ready to make the biggest sacrifice for his conscience and conviction - not his religion, which has abandoned him, like Jesus was abandoned by his.
It's not a simple journey. Franz is only human and has his doubts. He loves his wife and family. He loves his farm, the fields and the mountains - and who wouldn't after being immersed in the incredible beauty. His strength to abandon this all will only come gradually.
The movie, in images and sound, is simply magnificent. A masterwork. I'm not going to repeat that further.

This is literally the most boring film I've ever seen. I'm normally ""OK"" with movies where events happen that move the plot rather than a lot of dialog. In this case really there are no plot moving events and almost no dialog.This was just painful to watch. Nothing happens in 99.9% of the movie, just loooooong rolling views of waterfalls, wheat fields, mountain vistas, people going about their lives doing chores and so on. Probably 90% of the screen time is just a camera showing meaningless scenery.Bottom line this film wastes what could be a very interesting subject and is the most mind numbing, boring experience you can possibly imagine.To recap you get 2.75hrs of views of wheat fields, mountains, chores, sheering sheep and so on with NO dialog.

The film is long, and, as with Malick's many other beauties, the story comes second to the artistry through which the story is told. The medium is the message here.
This fact may seem counter-intuitive when the story is of one of such cultural significance -- a peasant farmer, Franz, puts life and family on the line in favor of his personal faith and ethics, when he refuses to swear loyalty to Hitler.
Through beautiful shots, that on their own could be masterful photographs, Malick tells the story of a faith so pure that there appears to alternative other than the choice Franz has made. And yet, this film is not pious. It is a simple story, about a simple man with simple faith, who makes a simple choice of profound significance.

But this movie seems determined to be another ethereal art piece that's sort of a movie. The narrative is kept simple, not reaching the soulful depths i was expecting. The cinematography is fine but it's not life-changing. I mean, the location is really the star, and the angles and shots are merely relaying a background of beauty; in other words, filming in the Bavarian Alps you tend to get a lot of breathtaking shots. So what you end up getting is three hours of overindulgence in movie-making, and not a satisfying experience.

219,jeganboothroyd,Malick's Most Accessible Film Since Badlands (1973),9,5 January 2020,"A Hidden Life, Malick's latest film, is easily his most watchable since his debut. With a story that is both gripping and emotional the film draws you in and takes you on the journey of Franz Jägerstätter and immerses you into his world.
The film follows Franz as he meets his wife, acted in an Oscar worthy turn by Valerie Pachner, and World War Two starts. Franz is taken to boot camp but, in 1943, when it is time for him to swear allegiance to Hitler and fight for the Nazis Franz can't bring himself to do it. Malick helps us to sympathize with Franz by using the first part of the film to immerse us totally into his Austrian village and witness how his peaceful world works. This helps us understand Franz's thinking as if the war comes to his village it would be destroyed.
As Franz continues to maintain his stance and not swear an oath to Hitler the consequences become more and more severe until he is inevitably put to death. It is a truly moving film that, I feel, Malick expertly tells. Any fan of Malick can tell you that since his resurgence in '98 and since the start of this decade with his film Tree of Life (2011) he has become much more philosophic in his storytelling. His films can often feel lost, without story, and as if they lack meaning and only serve to show pretty images (see all To The Wonder, Knight of Cups, and Song to Song). Yet they are clearly masterfully made. A Hidden Life is a very welcome return to storytelling. Malick seems to put all the tools he's accumulated since the beginning of his career, voiceover narration from Badlands, natural light cinematography from Days of Heaven, philosophical thinking on acts of war from The Thin Red Line and The New World, AND a wandering camera (see all his films from the 2010's). Yet it never seems, in my opinion, pretentious. Rather a culmination of these tools being expertly used to tell a beautiful story worthy of being told.
Beautiful acting, cinematography, and directing makes this one of the years absolute best films.",A Hidden Life

221,duong_nguyen,The meaning of persistantly following your own belief,8,26 June 2020,"A film with nearly 3 hours long, but it does not feel that long thankfully for the incredible acting, cinemaphotography and storyline. The story unfold at two location, in the moutain villige where Franz and his family: wife, 3 daughters and mother lives their quite, peaceful life full of love and laughter; and Berlin where he is imprisoned and executed. The narative is told by letters between Franz and his wife, contrast with the harsh reality, the torture in prison, the grudge of villiger toward Franz's family, whom they believe to be a traitor, carefully left out in their letters. They only tell each other about love, and good things throughout the film, even after Franz received his sentence. Watching the film, I constantly hoping for a miracle, a happy ending for our hero, but the miracle came 2 years too late. I can't help but wondering, a question Franz repeatedly asked:"" Do you thing your action will change anything ?"" But the fact that, today his story is widely known by us, those watched this film, itself means something. At least, now, his bravery is known. Now, his life is no longer hidden.",A Hidden Life

One of the most beautiful and honest films I've seen from years, based on events that took place, long or 3 hours, and its rhythm is very slow to some extent, it will remain the same reminiscence, long scenes and few words, but at the core, terrible photography cadres and the proximity of cameras to faces says more than words, calm music and doesn't act on feelings, a large space for questions and thinking about answers during the 3 hours.",A Hidden Life

This is an epic story of deep, passionate love between its two protagonists and of inspirational Christian faith so deep and so complete that it allows beauty, peace and optimism to prevail even in the darkest of circumstances. There is no better film for our times. A must see for any Christian and any adult who wants us to be back on the path of justice. Score and photography are unparrelled.

On how we live our lives in the face of evil be it part of present or future and what are men and women willing to do to be free
On how their spirits are stronger then violence and abuse and stronger then those who yield to the dark fascination of tyranny

The film represents the hopeless struggle to fight for the highest form of ideal, and much like expected, this ideal is condamned to death along with the human soul preserving it.

231,Kliffan,The Malick Path,7,27 June 2020,"I watched this movie in my local theatre, only me and another random person which left after nearly two hours. The stories of the latter Malick movies are without doubt toned down in both lingualistic script but, also in terms of what you as a viewer are given in terms of context. Thus on A Hidden Life, the story is not such a floating experience, in terms its in reach of grasping, yet understandable as it is understable. The turbulence of the war, pinned together with impeccable the nature of Austria, showing hints of absurd mentally frustration along with cinematograpic excellence. Your mindset gets into the main character and his wife, and you feel with them, yet you can also see feel there is some other paths to be taken, but instead of exploting this tension, it kind of falls into its own trap, squeazing everything down into a box, making the 3 hours somewhat undisfactional. Malick has a unique way of making his movies, but his more ""productive"" sequal of his career is not as firm and to-the-point as it once was.",A Hidden Life

234,mikeclapper,"Transcendent Beauty, Truth, and Goodness in Film",10,9 January 2020,"Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and grippingly reflective, this film immerses you inside the life of Franz Jägerstätter and his beloved wife Fani. So in love and so tender I'd their affection for one another, and it spills over into their family and friendships. Yet as much as he loves these excellent gifts, he is confronted with a choice of having to swear an oath to an evil leader who tramples on the vulnerable and is evil. What can he (or anyone) do? He chooses to walk in the footsteps of Christ and suffer. He chose not to defend himself, not reviling when reviled at, not bowing to the pressure of swearing allegiance to Hitler when everyone else did it, not listening to the voices of everyone (but Fani) tell him that resisting makes no difference and he would wreck his family. He embraced the path of suffering even though no one but God would see what he did.The film is a visual poem, and all the imagery and music supports the narrative of following the way of Christ even into the valley of the shadow of death. So much could be said about the symbolism of it all, but it's enough for here to note that the biblical themes are not explained but shown through the imagery and music.See it, if you want a more reflective, interior film that will inspire you to walk the path of suffering when your loyalties are challenged.",A Hidden Life

237,mebalzer-00602,"Masterpiece of sight, sound and TIME",10,2 January 2020,"After two hours in now squirming in my seat due to my falling asleep, I realized Malick's complete control or light, sound and TIME. Many reviews (even those who praised it) felt it was TOO long. I disagree, the length was important to show the duration of pain and suffering this family went through to a man who could not be wavered in his conscience, even if it meant the ultimate sacrifice. I have read that Malick takes a least a year to edit his footage, and as someone who has some experience in this area, it shows. Some feel his shots are tedious and redundant, but I felt each showed a similar scene with new elements, be it the time-of-day, season, or even a different sound. Also, the intimacy he conveys in a touch, be it gentle or forceful is reinforced through his editing technique. Finally, the music not only fit, but became a part of the mood, without standing out, and screaming ""listen to me"" as some directors (cough, cough Spielberg) seem to do. Like his far more popular ""Tree of Life,"" I feel this shows even more maturity and experience in his craft.Highly recommended, but please see it in a theatre or at least on a screen of 100"" in 4K with a quality sound system. Sadly most theatres, including Regal are still using 2K projectors. With my failing eyes, it is getting harder and harder to discern the difference (even with glasses) but this film demands it.",A Hidden Life
