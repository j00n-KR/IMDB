0,SnoopyStyle,talented cast,6,8 November 2016,"It's 1985 Tampa Bay, Florida. Family man U.S. Customs Service special agent Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) decides to follow the money rather than the drugs. Emir Abreu (John Leguizamo) helps him make connections. Mazur under a false identity uncovers a vast money laundering scheme with banks used by Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. After making up a fiancée, his boss Bonni Tischler (Amy Ryan) assigns green agent Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger) for the role.This real crime drama should be great material especially considering the talented cast. The movie turns out rather flat without intensity. The acting is solid but Brad Furman as the director adds very little to the final product. At times, the intense story gets surprisingly tedious. There is one scene with great potential. His wife gets caught up while they're on their anniversary dinner. There are different ways to button up the scene. She could completely break down or it could be funny if she really enjoyed it. The movie does neither and it ends up being an expected functional ride home. His wife does have two of the better scenes but the actual undercover work could have been more thrilling.",The Infiltrator
1,nogodnomasters,It's a Metaphor,8,24 September 2017,"This is based on a true story and book of Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) working as a DEA undercover agent out of Tampa. Mazur gets the idea to ""follow the money"" instead of the drugs. The film is nearly 2 hours of him meeting and chatting with bankers and various members of the Medellin Cartel in project C-Chase which also tied into CIA operations and the BCCI, a later scandal that was so complex, even when broken down and explained, Congress couldn't understand it.The film is a real life crime drama. It has some action just when things are starting to creep. Some killing, some blood, some close calls. No one jumping from roof top to roof top. No car chase scenes, one car crash scene. No one fighting with a bullet in them. Action is bland when compared to modern super cop films.Guide: F-word. Brief sex. No nudity.",The Infiltrator
2,kosmasp,Brutal reality of undercover work,9,12 June 2017,"Some things can feel like a drag. Like being an investigative undercover cop. You don't have much private life and you can't have too many friends. Well outside of the fake friendships you may create to get what you want. And while this does not hit you with a hammer over your head, there are subtle hints and some obvious ones in the portrayal Bryan Cranston gives us.There are quite a few good actors in this and all is based on real persons and a real case. It really is difficult to capture all this and go into all the private moments. Even with two hours running time, there is certain things that have to be left out. But it still is very coherent and very suspenseful, from start to finish. It's not quite Infernal Affairs, but then again what movie is? This is powerful and while the most of the characters are despicable, they are also human beings and the struggle and transformation feels real.Having said that, I do understand if for some this is not enough, one criticism I didn't get is about the music. Soundtrack by the numbers? What is that supposed to be? You can dislike the movie obviously taste-wise, but I would seriously like to know what another reviewer meant by this.",The Infiltrator
3,lee_eisenberg,1980s Florida in all its sleaze,6,18 October 2016,"Bryan Cranston first came to the public's attention as the dad on ""Malcolm in the Middle"", and then had a lead role on ""Breaking Bad"". He has since played roles in ""Contagion"", ""Argo"", ""Godzilla"", ""Trumbo"" and ""All the Way"". Now he gets a role as a US Customs special agent who brought down the drug traffickers' money-laundering organization in the 1980s. The cocaine culture in Reagan-era Florida is remembered from ""Scarface"", and ""The Infiltrator"" shows an equally gritty world. Almost every character is a lowlife. It's a safe bet that the drug traffickers probably paid off a lot of the customs officers, which ensured that the cocaine could pass through unimpeded.As expected, Cranston turns in a fine performance as Robert Mazur, who did what he had to in order to balance his family life with the need to involve himself with a collection of sleazy people. I wasn't as impressed with the rest of the cast. I guess that the rest of the characters seemed underdeveloped. In the end, it's not any masterpiece, but worth seeing.",The Infiltrator
4,LeonLouisRicci,Awkward Expositions Collide - Suspenseful Story Anchored by Cranston's Angst,7,28 November 2017,"A Great Cast does some Fine Acting that Drives this Fractured Movie. It is Split into a Schizophrenic Story that Struggles to Balance the Two Competing Milieus.The Emphasis Switches, not so Seamlessly, from Corrupt Shiny Bankers to Psychopathic Drug Cartels. There is Evil being done with Paperwork and Wetwork and as the Film Unfolds these Things Blur, Disorient, and make the Viewing Experience Less than the Entertainment is should be.However, taking Each Element on its own, both sides of the Issue, (""The Sting""), are Engrossing Enough to Withstand the Ping-Ponging of the Story-Line. It's Bryan Cranston's Picture Portraying ""Real Life"" Undercover Agent Robert Mazzulo and Cranston's Angst Anchors the Movie as the Deceits and Deceptions Determine the Outcome of each Phase of the Case.It's a Good Looking Film with a Soundtrack that doesn't quite Nail the Songs of the Era but it's Not Too Distracting, because the rest of the Production Design is Snappy with its 1980's Template.The Banker/Gangster Expositions Collide now and then with Tonal Shifts and are Awkward, but Overall the Movie is Worth a Watch for some Good Acting and a Supply of Suspense.",The Infiltrator
5,CinemaSerf,A competent study of a shrewd investigator and some crooked bankers...,6,21 March 2021,"OK, first things first - this can be, at times, an incredibly dull film to watch. It is most certainly not an action movie and the pace, at times glacial, does little to create any of the jeopardy required to make this a compelling movie. It simply isn't. What it is, though, is a carefully constructed characterisation of Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston), an undercover US Customs agent who, rather famously in the 1980s, was part of an international team that cottoned on to an immensely lucrative money laundering operation using the then huge BCCI as a means to move drug money around the world with seemingly childlike ease. His role in the investigation, perilous at times, saw him compromise his own safety, his marriage and the lives of those closest to him as he adopted a sinister alter-ego for whom there were little boundaries. Cranston plays the lead role very well indeed, his ability to switch between characters is presented to us with a rather worrying degree of aplomb that lends a great deal of credibility not just to his part, but to the way in which these glorified confidence tricksters succeeded for quite a while in moving billions of dollars around the globe, despite the regulators' best efforts. Though pretty devoid of actual action, it's doesn't skimp on the depiction of the more violent nature their tasks which, coupled with the degrees of ruthlessness displayed from both sides, adds to the plausible narrative of this film. The supporting cast is a bit more hit and miss: Amy Ryan and Diane Kruger deliver well; Art Malik, Benjamin Bratt and Jason Isaacs less so - and we have a couple of typically charismatic cameos from Olympia Dukakis as his Aunt Vicky who appears to know quite a bit about numbered Swiss bank accounts. It's got something of the documentary about it - and taken in that spirit, it works ok. More the product of a booth in Langley, as ""Jack Ryan"" might say...?",The Infiltrator
6,neil-476,"Good, but doesn't stay in the memory",7,21 May 2018,"Robert Mazer, a US customs official on the point of retirement, sees an opportunity for his undercover drugs operation to be given a revised initiative whereby they will pursue the laundering of drug money rather than the drugs themselves.Bryan Cranston stars as Mazer in this adaptation of Mazer's autobiographical book, which follows Mazer and a small group of fellow operatives into very dangerous territory as, under assumed identities as money launderers, they follow the trail of drug money back through the hierarchy of the Medellin cartel and its satellite organisations. The danger and the growing closeness with his fellow agent fictional fiancée threaten his marriage, a genuine affection grows with one of the drugs cartel and his wife, and an international bank is brought down.Bryan Cranston, as Mazer, is brilliant - why was this man not a star years ago? And the rest of the cast is solid, too, in a film which is essentially a suspense thriller - will they get found out before their infiltration exercise comes to fruition? The story told here is intricate: more intricate than it needs to be in a film which doesn't need the detail, much of which isn't greatly plot-relevant, in order to tell the story. You are left concentrating on intricacies which don't really matter: the real-life denseness, in which every detail mattered hugely, could have been simplified more than it has been, because the main plotline is actually relatively straightforward.And, because of this, and because it retells a real-life story, there are details thrown in which go nowhere. We expect the conventions of film to apply, so when a big thing is made of a gift of jewellery, we expect a major plot pay-off; instead we get a minor sidenote.This is quite a good movie and, I suspect, a pet project of Cranston (he and Mazer are co-credited as executive producers), but it didn't have, for me, the impact it felt as if it expected.",The Infiltrator
7,ferguson-6,Cranston shines,6,13 July 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. The war on drugs has become a bit of a punchline in the real world, but has proved to be fertile ground for filmmaking: Sicario (2015), American Hustle (2013), Traffic (2000). Additionally, the popular Netflix show ""Narcos"" takes on the same Medellin drug cartel as this latest from director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer, 2011). The movie is based on the true events of Robert Mazur's book ""The Infiltrator: My Secret Life Inside the Dirty Banks Behind Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel"" (a title that's very descriptive, if a bit long).Bryan Cranston continues his impressive Hollywood run this time as Robert Mazur, the man who goes undercover to expose the money-laundering system of the cartel. His flamboyant alter-ego is known as Bob Musella, a character that allows Mazur (and Cranston) to show a side not typically seen. His antics get him inside Columbian Drug Lord Escobar's organization in the mid-1980's.When Mazur realizes the traditional method of chasing the drugs isn't working, he decides the age-old idiom ""follow the money"" might be a better approach. This takes him inside the world of international money laundering, and he learns that banks and governments are quite dependent on this huge business of drug money movement.There are specific groups of people here: the government agencies, the small task force, the corrupt (and appreciative) bankers, the various levels within the cartel, and even Mazur's family  all these forces intertwine to make life difficult for Mazur and his team, and provide a glimpse into the complexities of undercover work.In addition to stellar work from Cranston, the cast is terrific. John Leguizamo plays Mazur's motivated partner Abreu; Diane Kruger plays his undercover fiancé; Juliet Aubrey is Mazur's real life wife who doesn't much appreciate his declining the early retirement offer; Olympia Dukakis provides a dash of comedy relief as Mazur's Aunt; Yul Vasquez is the creepy money manager for Escobar; Benjamin Bratt plays Roberto, Escobar's right-hand man and the key to Mazur's case; and Elena Anaya (The Skin I Live In, 2011) is Roberto's wife. Also present are Amy Ryan, Jason Isaacs and the always great Michael Pare.There are a couple of standout scenes – one involving chicken and voodoo, and another with a briefcase mishap, but my favorite is the Happy Anniversary cake scene in the restaurant where Mazur flashes his alter-ego Musella for his real wife to see  and she is understandably stunned.The movie does a nice job of capturing the look and feel of the era (30 years ago), but it's somehow missing the elevated suspense it portends to drag us and the characters through. Some elements seemed impossible to believe – why would Mazur risk his family's safety? The timeline was a bit muddled. We aren't sure how much time has passed, but there certainly don't seem to be enough interactions before Roberto is telling Mazur he is ""like family"". It plays a bit like those romance movies where the two leads are head over heels in love after a conversation or two. An element is missing and it affects the level of tension throughout the film. And that's something even a Leonard Cohen song (""Everybody Knows"") can't fix.",The Infiltrator
8,phd_travel,"Timely, relevant and completely fascinating",9,25 August 2016,"The movie isn't perfect but when it is good it is really good. There are so many interesting aspects about the drug war that haven't been shown so centrally on film before - the white collar financial type undercover DEA operation and the money laundering aspect. This movie is timely and relevant. It's fascinating to see the money laundering by BCCI. And right now the money laundering scandal with the Malaysian fund 1MDB stretching from the U.S. to banks in Singapore is playing out. Drug movies have to be shooting a minute action movies to be exciting.Brian Cranston is as always watchable and sympathetic. It takes a moment of getting used to him on the other side of the drug war and Walter White comes to mind now and then. Diane Kruger shines as a DEA undercover agent posing as his fiancé. She is convincing, watchable and beautiful. She needs more feature film roles.There are a few faults: it's a bit confusing who some of the minor drug characters are and which side they are on. Some things leave you a bit confused and should have been clearer. Please give this movie a chance - don't give up if the start is a bit slow. This is a true story that deserves to be widely known. If you enjoyed Narcos so far this is a real treat.",The Infiltrator
9,deloudelouvain,Saw better about this subject.,6,25 December 2016,"I have to admit I had high expectations before watching The Infiltrator. The story, the cast, it had everything to make it an excellent movie night. But after watching it I'm slightly disappointed. It didn't deliver like I was hoping for. Nothing bad to say about the actors though, because they we're all good. It's just the story that is not captivating enough. Too slow with not enough action. Add on that that you have a ton of movies or series about this subject and a lot of those are better then The Infiltrator. I hoped seeing more about the life and business of Pablo Escobar but it's more about the infiltrator then about the drug lord himself. If you want more action and more about Escobar just watch the series Narcos instead. Okay that will take you much more time to watch but it's worth it. All in all The Infiltrator isn't that of a bad movie. It just could have much better.",The Infiltrator
10,Hellmant,Decently entertaining.,8,21 July 2016,"'THE INFILTRATOR': Four Stars (Out of Five)A crime drama flick; based on the true story of an aging U.S. customs agent, named Robert Mazur, that helped take down Pablo Escobar's enormous money laundering business. The film was directed by Brad Furman (who's also helmed other crime flicks; like 'THE LINCOLN LAWYER', 'RUNNER RUNNER' and 'THE TAKE'), and it was written by first time screenwriter Ellen Brown Furman; the screenplay is based on Robert Mazur's autobiography (of the same name). The movie stars Bryan Cranston, Diane Kruger, John Leguizamo, Benjamin Bratt, Amy Ryan and Olympia Dukakis (Cranston and Leguizamo also costarred in 'THE LINCOLN LAWYER', and Leguizamo also starred in 'THE TAKE'). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's made a small amount of money at the Box Office (although it probably won't make a profit until video). I enjoyed it.The film is set in the 1980s; when Robert Mazur (Cranston) was set to retire from his job, as a U.S. Customs Service special agent. He then decided to take on a dangerous new assignment; infiltrating drug dealers, that were trying to clean up their dirty money. Robert used an alias, known as Bob Musella, and he got assistance from two other agents; Emir Abreu (Leguizamo) and Kathy Ertz (Kruger). It was Ertz's first undercover assignment, and Robert was worried about her safety (and putting the job at risk). The assignment also ended up putting Robert's whole family in danger.The movie is a little routine, and unoriginal, but I think the cast, and direction, make up for that. It does, at times, have a strong TV feel to it; but the Furmans are able to breath some intense drama, and excitement into it. Cranston, Leguizamo and Kruger all do what they do best (as well); and Kruger looks stunningly beautiful in it, too. The film is decently entertaining, I'd say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA",The Infiltrator

So many of these movies based on a true story end in the same way. they show a picture of the actor next to the real life person, and have text explaining what happened to them and where they are today. it has been done SOOOO many times. it is getting to the point where it's a cliche, and i'm just sick of it. they need to stop making so many movies based on a true story and start using creativity to come up with a good movie story",The Infiltrator
12,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Highly satisfying mob thriller you don't see so much of now,9,21 August 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning During the 1980s, the Medellin cartel funnelled a limitless supply of drugs through the port of Miami. Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) was an undercover agent, who assumed an identity as a mob member who conceived a clever plan for the criminals to move their ill gotten gains through the channels, and grew close to the top members of the Medellin hierarchy as he went along, but his position took an inevitable toll on his marriage to wife Evelyn (Juliet Aubrey) and placed his life in a constant state of danger.The limitless supply of true life crime stories from the archive of the 1980s flashes up once again with this expose of another crime scandal. Lead star Cranston appears to be one of the stars who found fame later in life, and made the biggest impression in the TV drama Breaking Bad, which I never caught. And so, this would seem to be the piece where I caught him for the first time, and he certainly has the presence to carry this role through. The film plays in a similar vein to 1997's Donnie Brasco, and those who enjoyed that film will be on pleasingly similar ground here.Director Brad Furman helms proceedings in a manner that will have become familiar to those who catch a great deal of present day crime thrillers, in a gritty, uncompromising manner, only by unflinchingly honing in on the predicament of Mazur's situation, rather than on any gratuitous blood letting scenes, in particular a harrowing scene in a restaurant where he's forced to make an example of a poor, innocent waiter to keep face in front of a mob pal. But it all builds up to a satisfying pay-off in the end, and you'll be glad you stuck with it.Aside from Cranston, there is a wonderful supporting cast, including the likes of John Leguizamo, Daniel Mays and Joseph Gilgun to keep the ship floating. Not that the juicy, shattering revelations of the 1980's crime scene won't be enough. ****",The Infiltrator
13,MOscarbradley,Watchable but hardly memorable,6,11 August 2017,"Bryan Cranston is ""The Infiltrator"" and it's Pablo Escobar's drugs cartel that he's infiltrating. Brad Furman's thriller takes some time to build up a head of steam but once it does, about two-thirds of the way in, it's pretty exciting. Cranston obviously got the part on the coat-tails of ""Breaking Bad"" but he's miscast here, (even in ""Breaking Bad"" he was never that convincing playing the tough guy), and it's left to the likes of John Leguizamo as his tough-talking, streetwise partner and Yul Vazquez's flamboyant, bisexual villain to carry the picture.There's a lot of plot to get through and even more characters, most of them hiding behind beards and all of them nasty. Where the film scores is in showing just how dangerous undercover work can be and there's a nice touch of black humour in the climax. It's said to be based on a true story and they do say that truth is stranger than fiction but this does seem rather far-fetched. It's certainly watchable but with a stronger script it might even have been memorable.",The Infiltrator
14,bowmanblue,"Not 'vintage' Cranston, but not bad either",7,8 March 2018,"Post 'Breaking Bad' I confess that I'll watch anything with Bryan Cranston in it. A few of his efforts since giving up the meth trade have been a little disappointing, but I was pleased to see that he was pretty much on form here in 'The Infiltrator.' Granted it's still not up to the dramatic standards of 'Breaking Bad,' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not worth a watch.It's a true life tale (or as true as any Hollywood adaptation is these days) set in the early eighties where a drugs officer (Cranston) goes undercover in order to infiltrate the organised drugs trade of the day. Like I say, I don't know how many liberties have taken with the story, but it does seem to try and remain grounded in realism, not bothering with any major shoot-outs, punch-ups or car chases. So, if you're looking for some 'Bad Boys' style action epic, you're be sorely disappointed here.As Cranston slowly progresses deeper and deeper into the trade, don't expect the speed of the film to pick up much. As I mentioned, it's definitely not about action and focuses on how far he has to go and what he has to sacrifice in order to remain undercover (and therefore remain alive!). In short: it's a slow-burner.The supporting cast tends to be a load of people who you say, 'Oh, I've seen him in that film - you know the one I mean' and 'It's her out of that other TV show.' They're all functional enough, but Cranston has to carry it and without him it probably would never have been given a theatrical release in the first place. Even with my love of Cranston's work, I have to say I found the first half almost a little too slow and was debating whether I'd like it in the end. However, it does still pick up enough to all come together in the end and, if you're into a more 'thoughtful/realistic' take on a tale that most of us seasoned cinema-goers will have seen countless times, it's certainly worth a watch.",The Infiltrator
15,dromasca,'boring and watchable',5,25 August 2016,"I could not avoid borrowing the qualifications used by a Web site from Toronto when writing about this film. It's 'boring and watchable'. An unusual combination indeed. And yet, this is exactly how I feel about 'The Infiltrator' directed by Brad Furman - a talented director who succeeded much better IMO with The Lincoln Lawyer.I must also confess from the start that I am not a fan of the 'true crime' genre. Reality has the disadvantage of being in many cases confusing, and bringing it to screen demands a level of processing that elevates it above what we - as spectators - live in our daily lives. After all we do not pay the price of the ticket to live inside the cinema theaters the same lives as we do in the fresh air outside. Script writers and directors approaching the genre face the dilemma of either sticking to the truth of the story (and risk to be drown in the details) or of 'dramatizing' the reality to make it better fit to screen (and risk losing credibility). Succeeding is not only an exercise in balance but also requires the art of finding the artistic truth that makes the film valuable and attractive for viewers beyond the documentary news.The element that makes 'The Infiltrator' different is the building of the relationship between anti-drug cop Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) and the drug dealers and the bankers that financed the business in the crime organization that he infiltrated in the 80s playing the role of a money launderer. There is tension in the building of the undercover team and the way they gain the trust of the lethally criminals they deal with, but the difference is really the fact that Mazur not only starts living as the character he poses as, but also seems to develop feelings of real sympathy (if not friendship) towards his enemies-in-law.The result is to some extent convincing, but it takes a long way to get to it, almost the totality of the two hours film. The rest of the time is spent into telling a cops vs. drug dealers story that is not too original and not too different from so many other stories we have already seen on screen. The inflation of real life characters brought too screen because they were around in the real story, but not really living a screen life of their own makes much of the introduction part, and much of what happens next confusing. Bryan Cranston is OK in his role, but an actor with more charisma could have made the character more interesting. The best acting in the film came from John Leguizamo, an actor I have seen in many supporting roles, and I am glad to see that he gets near more consistent roles towards a lead role in the future that he certainly deserves.The Infiltrator is not the big crime film 'inspired by a true story' that I am waiting for.",The Infiltrator
16,secondtake,A great retelling of a true undercover drama in the 80s,7,11 February 2017,"The InfiltratorIn some ways this might seem like a straight up crime and drugs movie, with Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston in the leading role. But these true events and actual characters take you to the top of a government effort to undercut the money laundering operations of the biggest cartel of all.And Cranston is great. Around him is a really strong cast, including some disreputable types from all around. The pressures are huge, and the tension believable as people question who they can trust. Because to go undercover requires people helping you keep your cover, and that's increasingly hard because the money, and the low price of a life, are constant pressures.The movie is based in Florida in the 1980s, and it's a weird place to revisit. Diane Kruger is a great, relaxed presence once she shows up, and John Leguizamo is terrific as a sidekick, essential to the energy of the film.There some problems, for sure, with compacting the plot or characterizing Escobar. Or making the private life of the main agent so easily intertwined with the undercover world—they should be states apart. But never mind the quibbles. A strong, commanding movie.",The Infiltrator

Robert Mazur (Cranston) and Emir Abreu (Leguizamo) are U.S. Customs officials trying to stop the drug trafficking in the US. When they don't seem to be making any progress Robert decides the only real way to get to the top is to go undercover and find who is actually financing the cocaine business. What he finds is that the deeper he goes and the more he uncovers the further into the world he gets, and the more he becomes connected to the people but not in the way he was expecting. This is, first off a good movie. That being said, one of the benefits to my job is that I get to watch a ton of movies. One of the downside to doing reviews, is that because there are only really a handful of stories that keep getting told over and over. This small fact means that, most of the time unfairly, comparisons between other movies are inevitable. While this was a good movie I had a hard time not thinking of Donnie Brasco or even the Departed. Other movies where agents went undercover in a dangerous world. When compared to those this movie is no where close. Taken on its own the movie is good but, for me at least, it wasn't one of the better movies in this genre. Overall, acting is good, story is interesting, pacing was a little off and just felt a little flat in some parts. That said, it is worth watching and I have seen worse. It's no Donnie Brasco.

Funny in s sense that it was kinda funny during wedding scene - no spoilers. Nevertheless, this is sometimes very tense ""undercover"" film, very involvingly written one. Acting was also very good by everyone involved, especially by lead of course. Directing was also pretty solid, but its the script who shines in ""The Infiltrator"" and although it is not very fresh, the fact that it was written based on very true events makes for a fault.Overall, ""The Infiltrator"" is simply a good movie which at running time 2 hours never dragged and was involving from start to finish.

In such a tight spot how he and his team are going to achieve the one of a biggest crack in the history revealed in the remaining.So now we know the story, but this is not an easy game. There are many scenes that would pull you to the edge of your seat. After the wonderful performance in 'Trumbo' that got him an Academy Awards nominee last year, now he's back with another great character display. I'm talking about Bryan Cranson. Another Oscar's nod is quite possible in a second year row, but lets wait and see. This story mainly focused on him, but John Leguizamd was also impressive in an important supporting role and so the Diane Kruger.I think it was a most realistic undercover film among others I have seen. The drugs were not shown much and so the sex and nudes, despite the plot revolved around that. Even the stunts were minimised, but those rare action sequences were so good. The majority of the film was drama with lots of thrill scenes. The two hours long film, and the story were narrated with a good pace.

20,tomgillespie2002,"Full of null, but does them very well",6,12 October 2016,"Faring far better as a big-screen leading man than he did in last year's disappointing biopic Trumbo, Bryan Cranston brings a slightly grizzled decency to his role as U.S. Customs special agent Robert Mazur in Brad Furman's The Infiltrator, a by-the-numbers, if suitably engrossing, fact-based drama. Mazur decides that his final operation before retirement will be to go undercover to infiltrate the criminal organisation headed by one of the key figures in helping turn Miami into a bullet-ridden, cocaine-fuelled war-zone during the 1980s, Pablo Escobar.Mazur is a mild-mannered, if fiercely intelligent, family man, who must transform himself into a slick money launderer that will somehow talk his way into Escobar's inner circle, befriending one of the drug baron's top lieutenants - Benjamin Bratt's Robert Alcaino - in the process. Similar to Walter White's transformation from passive high school teacher into a mass-murdering, downright evil bastard in Breaking Bad, Cranston is again required to undergo a complete character change throughout the course of the story (albeit here as an act). Yet while Walter White was given 5 years to convincingly develop his arc, Mazur's seduction by a more dangerous way of life isn't given the attention it deserves.Cranston is still terrific however, as are the supporting cast. A slip of the tongue means that Mazur's alter-ego Bob Musella also has a fiancée, so fellow agent Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger) is called in, and the relationship between the two secret agents, both professionally and the obvious sexual chemistry between the two, is one of the more interesting aspects of the movie. Also assisting Mazur with the sting is Emir Abreu, played with wide-eyed, jacked-up intensity by John Leguizamo. Abreau is a fellow agent whose motivations may rest more with the adrenaline rush that naturally goes with living constantly on edge than a desire to see justice served, and many of Leguizamo's best scenes are in those moments when you feel everybody is about to get rumbled.It's interesting, no-nonsense stuff, but sadly doesn't strive to be anything but that. Hints made at Mazur's inner-conflict and the finer details of the case itself are left relatively unexplored, so anyone hoping for a deeper experience than your standard genre movie will no doubt be left disappointed. The Infiltrator is instead happy to sit within the comforts of cliché, covering everything from the concerned wife at home (played by Juliet Aubrey) to the criminal who is actually quite nice deep down. But to give the film it's credit, it does the null very well, successfully building tension and delivering the occasional heart-in-mouth moment when called upon. Cranston has done his inevitable ascension to the A-list no harm either, and Leguizamo proves why people really need to take him seriously as an actor again.",The Infiltrator
21,Thanos_Alfie,Outstanding...,7,12 January 2019,"""The Infiltrator"" is a Biography - Crime movie in which we watch a U.S. Customs Service special agent working undercover in order to cooperate with drug lords and clean their dirty money. After gaining a reputation he infiltrates the world's largest cartel, the Medellín cartel, and he has to do his best in order to expose the work of drug lord Pablo Escobar.I liked this movie very much because it is based on the life events of a real person and his actions. This movie has a very interesting plot which is combined very well with a lot of plot twists that you don't expect at all and makes it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Brad Furman is simply amazing with a lot of great scenes. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Bryan Cranston who played as Robert Mazur and he didn't let me down not even for a second, he was simply outstanding at his role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were John Leguizamo's who played as Emir Abreu and he was also very good at his role, and Diane Kruger's who played as Kathy Ertz and she gave a different touch and beauty in this movie.Finally, I have to say that ""The Infiltrator"" is a great movie with an interesting plot, a very good direction and many great interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it, you will be surprised by its plot and you won't be let down by your choice of watching it.",The Infiltrator
22,leonblackwood,Lacked detail but worth a watch! 5/10,5,22 August 2017,"Review: The thing that made the Breaking Bad series so great, was the fact that Bryan Cranston was the most unlikely drug dealer you could ever find, which was why he wasn't the perfect choice for an undercover agent in this movie. He really seemed out of place throughout the whole film, and I was surprised that no one questioned who he was, and we're he came from. The fact that it was based on true events, makes me feel that the director missed out some key moments, because he seemed to join the cartel with ease, which made it feel unrealistic. Anyway, Bryan Cranston plays an undercover officer called Robert Mazur, who tries to takedown Pablo Escobar's operation, with fellow officers Emir Abreu (John Leguizamo) and Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger), who plays his pretend wife. As they have failed to get to the heads of the cartel from a drug angle, they decide to try a money angle, which seems to make Robert move up the ladder much quicker. He soon becomes friends with one of the big bosses, Roberto Alcaino (Benjamin Bratt), and he gains the trust of some top banks, which makes his operation seem believable. Once they have enough information, the secret agents gather at Roberts fake wedding to Kathy, to takedown all of the culprits they have been investigating but after spending so long in the drug world, Robert can't help feeling bad, whilst watching the people he has come close to, get taken down with nowhere to run. It's quite an interesting story, which must have been pretty scary to be in but I personally think that the movie could have been more intense, especially as Robert was surrounded by so many murderers. When an agent is undercover, I don't expect them to go home to there family every night, and I thought it would have been easy to work out that they were using names of dead people. Anyway, it's a decent movie which is worth a watch but there are better films in this genre. Watchable!Round-Up: Judging by the money that this movie made at the box office, it's obvious that Bryan Cranston, 61, hasn't got a certified, bankable name as of yet, and with movies like Godzilla and Trumbo not going down to well with the critics, it's going to take a massive hit for him to come out of this bad run of movies. He's definitely a unique actor, which is good at his craft but it's his choice of projects, which has to be questioned. Anyway, this movie was directed by Brad Furman, who has brought you the movies, The Take, The Lincoln Lawyer and Runner Runner. I think that this movie lacked the attention to detail which it needed, like in Blow starring Johnny Depp but John Leguizamo was great because he brought some wit to a difficult situation. On the plus side, it did make me look into Robert Mazur's true story but apart from that, it will be quickly forgotten. Budget: $47.5million Worldwide Gross: $18.3millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/crime/dramas, starring Bryan Cranston, Amy Ryan, John Leguizamo, Benjamin Bratt, Joseph Gilgun, Jason Isaacs and Diane Kruger. 5/10",The Infiltrator
23,TheMovieDiorama,The Infiltrator showcases the dangerous and difficult career of an undercover agent.,6,2 March 2018,"This film details the true story of drug trafficking and laundering illegal money. Agent Robert Mazur invented a persona with a rich and lavish lifestyle in order to infiltrate Pablo Escobar's trafficking scene which was becoming apparent in 1986. Going deeper and deeper undercover in order to build a case that leads to indictments of more than 100 drug lords. Fascinating, ever so fascinating. What was really profound was the slow build up of trust and admiration between Mazur's cover up character and the drug lords of Colombia. The film portrayed them as normal people, genuine human beings with families. Sure what they were doing was completely illegal and something you shouldn't attempt at home...that something being an illegal drug trafficking scheme, but seeing that trust break at the end was actually melancholic. Captivating dual performances from both Cranston and Leguizamo, I thought they suited their roles incredibly well. Casting the beauty that is Diane Kruger is always great and I thought Benjamin Bratt's performance was noteworthy. The directing style was, on the whole, good. Nothing outstanding but towards the end wedding scene there were some nice long shots which I admired. There are a lot of characters in this story consisting of agents, family members, drug lords and corrupt bankers. It takes quite some time to establish them and get the story flowing, in fact I found the first half to be rather underwhelming. Nothing really engaged me. It's quite a meaty runtime (127 minutes) and honestly this could've been cut substantially. The second half was much better which included more tension and character investment. I also found that scenes just seemed to have been cut, one point we're in a hotel then all of sudden we're in France. Seemed to have been strung together to try and create flow but if anything it just hindered the narrative. However, some great performances and some interesting characters make for a good true story albeit unmemorable.",The Infiltrator
24,paul-allaer,More about BCCI than it is about Escobar.,8,16 July 2016,"""The Infiltrator"" brings the story of undercover agent Robert Mazur. As the movie opens (with Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" blasting away), we are reminded that it is ""Tampa, Florida 1985"", and we see Mazur at work, in what turns out the be the last phase of an undercover job. Due to his length of service, Maruz is offered the possibility to retire with full benefits. Instead, to the dismay of his wife Ev, he decides to take on one more job, far more complicated and dangerous than he ever imagined. As this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Brad Furman, who previously brought us the Matthew McConaughey-fronted thriller ""The Lincoln Lawyer"". Screenplay is by Ellen Brown Furman (I imagine related to the director, but don't know for a fact). This is a narco crime drama that is essentially ""The Sting"" on steroids: can Maruz (in his undercover role as Bob Musella) and his rookie partner Kathy Ertz pull off a sting of gigantic proportions, right under the noses of the feared Colombia drug cartel of Pablo Escobar? As you have probably noted, the connection with Pablo Escobar is played up in the movie's marketing materials. The reality is that Escobar is perhaps hovering over the movie in spirit, but the movie in fact is a lot more about what happened with BCCI (the UK's Bank of Credit and Commerce International), the 7th largest private bank at that time. (And if you are looking for a true Escobar crime drama, check out ""Escobar: Paradise Lost"", starring Benicio Del Toro and Josh Hutcherson.) ""The Infiltrator"" has many great moments, and is tense almost from the get-go. Bryan Cranston, on the heels of the excellent ""Trumbo"" last year (but still best known for his work on TV's ""Breaking Bad""), delivers yet another winning performance. But the big surprise for me was the outstanding work from Diane Kruger as the rookie undercover partner. She is superb (aside from being superbly beautiful). Lots of great songs throughout the movie, including The Who's ""Eminence Front"", which plays not once but twice in the movie! ""The Infiltrator"" opened this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, somewhat to my (pleasant) surprise. I found ""The Infiltrator"" to be a riveting narco crime-drama, the likes of which we don't get to see enough, and would encourage you to check it out, be it in theaters, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Infiltrator"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The Infiltrator
25,subxerogravity,Well done crime drama for Bryan Cranston,8,16 July 2016,"The Infiltrator is a perfect fit for Bryan Cranston. It has the right amount of Walter White elements to wheel us in, but this time around he gets to be on the other side of Law Enforcement (well sort of) As Robert Mazur, Cranston plays a seasoned undercover cop on the verge of taking down the biggest drug cartel in history, at the same time, he's trying to balance his personal life with his career. A lot of the strength in the movie is the moments when the cops are on the balance beam and attempt not to cross the line, with intense moments of Mazur's career and family accidentally crossing paths.An excellent performance by John Leguizamo when it comes to this. He plays a undercover cop who gets too excited about being undercover. He has his moments when he explores the darkness and it gets to him, which are very deep. Plus he was a good Yin to Cranston's Yang.I love Benjamin Bratt in the film (Although, getting a little tired of him playing the head of the drug cartel in all these movies)The Infiltrator was a perfect blend of gritty crime drama with a dark sense of humor. The combo made for a realness in the police work.The cinematography does a good job in getting us into the 1980s era, and helps with the grittiness. sometimes it did feel like I was being beaten over the head with footage that places in the time period but that's fine.Overall this a a point for Bryan Cranston as a good leading man, and it's a great crime drama.",The Infiltrator

I've met her on the set of ""355"" film, she looks even better in reality than on screen, in film, the body shapes look bigger. She plays a cool role in this one too, as she only knows. Bryan Cranston is exceptional in the role of Robert Mazur. Also Juliet Aubrey as Evelyn Mazur, John Leguizamo as Emir Abreu, Benjamin Bratt as Roberto Alcaino, Elena Anaya as Gloria Alcaino, Yul Vazquez as Javier Ospina, etc. All the actors are good.

A US customs special agent went undercover to put a stop to Pablo Escobar's Columbian drug cartel, or at least try to slow it down a bit-Remember, this was when Ronald Reagan was President and his wife Nancy was just saying 'No' to drugs. Bryan plays the undercover agent tasked with the job. John is a fellow agent that helps him make connections in the drug world. When situations get too heated Bryan gets an assist from another agent, Diane-who happens to be on her first assignment undercover-as his fiancé. Trying to get close to Pablo Escobar is no easy task, what with all the security measures, big banks laundering money, etc. and Benjamin is Pablo's next in command. Any little mistake can, and often does, end in a violent death or dismemberment. The best part of this movie is the acting, of course, and Bryan really sells the part. He is very good. All the problems of living undercover are touched on-getting close to drug lords and becoming their friends-and during the end credits, you get to see what happened to the surviving cast of players. I think I read that the operation ended in the arrests of something like 85 people. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes.

Cranston brilliantly portrays the difficulty of keeping the two worlds he lives within and his emotions apart. Based on true events, Cranston's character has gone undercover in an attempt to set up and pull off a massive money laundering scheme to lure in top level drug cartel offenders. Paced nicely, you see how the scheme builds and how deeper and intertwined Cranston gets with various players. The focus is more on the character relationships, crisp dialog and slow burn tension, rather than elaborate action scenes. The soundtrack is less subtle but hit the right vibe and worked for me. Overall, this was a slightly unique approach to a genre with a slew entries, many of which are legendary.",The Infiltrator
29,aharmas,Pure Perfection,10,15 July 2016,"This is a movie that will take you on a ride that you will never forget, enveloping with tension, darkness, and the magic only a great production can have. For that you need solid story telling and directing skills, and to complete the package, one can only be thankful for the work of the actors involved. Cranston, leguizamo, and Pratt give what could their best turns ever, and the work done by Kruger is magnificent, reminding us how good and sexy she can be. Cranston is a man who has done well in his government post. He's about to retire comfortable but can't let a golden opportunity go by. It can certainly bring success and fame and might give him a chance to live what one can guess is a longing to experience the ultimate thrill if accomplishing a feat few ever do, to leave a mark in his did, but this could also mean irreparable damage or death.He's familiar with the connections he needs to infiltrate a dangerous world deeper than he ever tried. He knows the logistics, but he can never predict human nature. He soon realizes that once he goes in, there are only two options to succeed or to give his life. It will be the ultimate performance both professionally and personally. He will live his dream, always having the possibility that it might become a complete nightmare.Little by little he goes into the most selective and dangerous circles of the drug world. He interacts with apparently honest professionals who are part of this world. He also hangs with the lowest members of this society, risking his life every minute. The film pumps the suspense and never lets go. It's the good old fashioned thriller that gives you action and a complete character exploration. We known these are real people but most importantly, the performances make you feel you are seeing something really good. In the end, one can't complain that is nothing short of spectacular, a great achievement and a reminder that we can still have a grand time at the movies. A big thank you to all the parties involved, and see at awards time.",The Infiltrator
30,valleyjohn,Slightly disappointing,7,5 October 2016,"The Infiltrator sees Brian Cranston back on drugs again ( not literally ) where he plays undercover federal agent Robert Mazur who is a money launderer for Pablo Escobar's Medellín Cartel. Instead of focusing on the drugs side of things this film concentrates more on the money and the dodgy bankers and that doesn't always make the most interesting subject in films. Having said that , director Brad Furman does a good job of conveying what it's like to go undercover in such a dangerous organisation. I don't think this is anywhere near as good as the recent Netflix series Narcos which it is inevitably going to be compared to because at times it feels little bit laboured but good performances from Brian Cranston , John Leguizamo and Diane Kruger make it well worth watching.",The Infiltrator

With the help Diane Kruger Mazur ingratiates himself perfectly into various homes and habits. Then there's Mazur's wife, bitter and bitter, the expendable Evelyn (British actress Juliet Aubrey, excellent). Director Brad Furman is obviously working in the long shadow of Martin Scorsese and the Breaking Bad team. Still, he's learned all the right lessons, especially when it comes to music. Them Two's Am I a Good Man and Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows chime thrillingly with the action. As solid entertainment goes, this is the business.

Much of the film feels flat and is remarkably low on tension for a story like this. There are some positives though and it is, overall, a relatively enjoyable film.Ordinarily I would probably be praising 'The Infiltrator', but given the material this film had at its disposal, it could have and really should have been a lot better.

33,drjgardner,Failure to infiltrate,5,15 July 2016,"There is some excellent acting here, especially from John Leguizamo and Diane Kruger, but I found myself hoping I could ""fast forward"". Not only is the pace problematic, the film fails to exact the kinds of suspense that you expect from a film like this. As such, my involvement in what happens to the character s was minimal. It didn't help that the period (the 1980s) is rarely invoked, so we are kept at arms' length from the location as well as the characters. And the plethora of dialogue, and the many characters who come and go, helped seal the film's fate.There are so many films about the drug problem in the U.S. (e.g., ""Traffic"", ""Scarface"", ""Sicario"", ""Clear and Present Danger"", ""Savages"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Bad Boys"") that this film doesn't stand out at all. The unique perspective of looking at an undercover operation that focuses on the money laundering situation is indeed refreshing, and the best part of the film. From that POV it is certainly worth watching. Had the direction, music, and photography been at the same quality as the acting, this would have been a truly memorable film.",The Infiltrator
34,bankofmarquis,Well acted character study - NOT an action film,7,14 July 2016,"I heard grumblings from two guys who were leaving the theater behind me after seeing THE INFILTRATOR that this movie did not have nearly enough action/bloodshed for them. I think they were expecting another SCARFACE or GOODFELLAS. That is not what this movie is. This movie is a character study of a man who goes undercover with the Pablo Escobar drug cartel and develops relationships/friendships with these bad guys in order to bring them down. The real conflict in this film is not the action, but rather, the RE-ACTION of ""the infiltrator"" - will he remember that he is just playing a role to bring down the bad guys, or will he lose himself in the role and the relationships and become a bad guy himself?If you are looking for an action movie, this movie will be a little too slow for you. If you are looking for good acting and a strong character study, then this is a very enjoyable film.Much of that enjoyment hinges on the performance of Bryan Cranston as Robert Mazur, ""The Infiltrator"". We follow him as he dives deep into this criminal organization. Cranston is in about 90% of the scenes of this movie, so his performance better be strong or this will be one long movie, indeed. Fortunately for us, his performance is better than strong. He continues his string of fascinating/watchable performances and he more than anchors this film and makes it worth watching.Ably assisting him is a strong supporting cast - Amy Ryan (as his boss), Jason Issaacs (somewhat wasted as the District Attorney), Benjamin Bratt (as one of the main bad guys), Olympia Dukakis (in a fun turn as his aunt) and Diane Kruger (defying age as another agent posing as his fiancé - when I first saw her I thought ""that's a young Diane Kruger"" until I realized it WAS Diane Kruger!). Finally, John Leguizamo as Mazur's partner, Emir Abreu is TERRIFIC. The best performance I've seen from him in quite some time. If this movie was a little better and a little later in the season, I'd be touting him for an Academy Award nomination.If you want blood, guts and action, wait for the Jason Bourne film. If you want an interesting, gripping film that is well acted check out the Infiltrator - you'll be glad you did!7 (out of 10 stars) and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",The Infiltrator
35,dave-mcclain,"""The Infiltrator"" is an engaging and entertaining true story which sticks close to the truth.",7,17 July 2016,"Bryan Cranston is such a great actor that his chameleon-like performances leave audiences wondering if there's any part that he can't play. Although he had taken on many roles in TV and movie dramas going back to the early 1980s, he first became well-known as a comic actor. Between 1994 and 2006, he played dentist Tim Whatley in ""Seinfeld"", another character named Tim in ""The King of Queens"" and became a three-time Emmy nominee for playing the inept but loving father on ""Malcolm in the Middle"". Soon after that show, Cranston's career took a more serious turn when he became high school chemistry teacher turned meth cook and, later, drug kingpin Walter White in ""Breaking Bad"", a role that brought him six more Emmy nods and four wins. But Cranston has never stopped doing comedy.While still doing ""Breaking Bad"", he had recurring roles on ""How I Met Your Mother"", ""The Cleveland Show"" and ""Robot Chicken"". He has also voiced characters in the ""Madagascar"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"" film franchises. Meanwhile, Cranston had important roles in dramatic movies like 2014's ""Godzilla"" and in three Best Picture Oscar nominees – ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Argo"", the last of which won the award, and then he earned his first individual Oscar nomination for playing the lead in 2015's ""Trumbo"". Bryan Cranston's talent for disappearing into a character serves him especially well as undercover U.S. Customs agent Robert Mazur in the biographical crime drama ""The Infiltrator"" (R, 2:07).Mazur was one of the best in the business – and has gone down in history as one of the most effective. As ""The Infiltrator"" opens, we see Mazur working undercover as a street-level drug dealer trying to bust a local south Florida drug ring. He's injured in the operation and is offered the opportunity to retire with benefits, but he thinks there's more good that he can do. Fellow agent Emir Abreu (John Leguizamo) comes to Mazur with what he says is a lead into the international drug operations of none other than Columbia's Medellin Cartel chief Pablo Escobar. Emir is street-wise, but Mazur thinks he's a bit of a loose cannon. Still, Mazur finds the prospect of breaking into Escobar's empire too tantalizing to pass up.After appropriate preparations (including finding and adopting a new name – Bob Musella), Mazur is posing as a high-level businessman who can help the cartel launder its drug money. As Musella, he gets deep into that world through contacts established by Emir, gets some credibility and important advice from convict Alexander Biscuiti (Joseph Gilgun), who is sprung from prison to help out, and even from his gutsy, but morally ambiguous aunt (Oscar winner Olympia Dukakis). Also along for the ride (and playing a major role in the operation) is Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger), on her first deep cover mission, playing the role of Musella's fiancé, partly because of a noble but dangerous mistake by Musella himself.Eventually, Musella gets to meet (and, along with Kathy, become close personal friends with) top Escobar lieutenant Roberto Alcaino (Benjamin Bratt). In order to bring this very complicated and perilous sting to a successful conclusion, Musella must deal with corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) bankers (played by Saïd Taghmaoui and Art Malik), shady informants (Juan Cely and Michael Paré), unpredictable Medellin cartel members (Yul Vázquez and Rubén Ochandiano), supportive but sometimes unreasonable supervisors (Amy Ryan and Jason Isaacs) and the constant danger to his team, his understanding but frightened wife, Evelyn (Juliet Aubrey), and their three young children.""The Infiltrator"" is an engaging and entertaining true story which sticks close to the truth. Screenwriter Ellen Sue Brown and director Brad Furman take a few understandable liberties with the actual story in order to make their movie clear and cohesive, but they manage to make an actual international banking scandal from the 1980s interesting and they don't waste Movie Fans' time with unnecessary exposition. The climactic scene is fabricated, but is fairly close to what happened in the operation and makes for a terrific closing to the story. Cranston's acting is fantastic as he portrays a real person whose job and very life depended on effectively playing a role for some very ruthless people. The rest of the cast is equally exceptional, making for one of the best and most diverse ensembles of 2016. The overall content of ""The Infiltrator"" is a little too ambitious and its spirit a bit too subdued, but it's well worth a look. ""B+""",The Infiltrator

This is based on a true story.You can't help but wish for more Breaking Bad early in the movie. Cranston is excellent in the lead role and his character is very grey as it should be with someone playing that role.

37,Danusha_Goska,"Gripping, Great Performances and High Production Values",8,24 July 2016,"""The Infiltrator"" is a gripping, intelligent, fast-paced cops-and- robbers movie with a dream cast and high production values. I was on the edge of my seat for almost the entire film. The top-notch performances by all involved, but especially Bryan Cranston, really sucked me in. That ""The Infiltrator"" tells a true story of a brave, resourceful, and heroic public servant, Robert Mazur, makes it inspirational as well as entertaining. It's the early 1980s and Colombians and others are exporting millions of dollars' worth of cocaine into the US. US Customs special agent Robert Mazur takes on the persona of Bob Musella, a Mafia-connected money-launderer. He offers his services to the Pablo Escobar cocaine drug lord. The Escobar gang takes him in and he and other Operation C-Chase agents take down the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the seventh largest bank in the world. Mazur is masked and driven through Colombian jungle where he is forced to participate in a grotesque voodoo ritual. He and his fake fiancée, Kathy Ertz, (Diane Kruger) are invited into the private homes of extremely wealthy and discriminating criminals, and he and Kathy form genuine personal relationships with them. Mazur's partner, Emir Abreu (John Leguizamo), gets a man killed and has a brief breakdown afterward. Indeed this is a very violent movie. At one point Mazur is conversing with a fellow undercover agent and without any warning the agent is shot to death with blood spattering everywhere. ""The Infiltrator"" doesn't offer any innovations on cops-and-robbers. Many other films have treated South American drug kingpins, Mafiosi, and undercover agents. Too, the movie never asks the question that must be ramming through the viewer's brain. ""Why the heck are we doing this? Why are we spending so much money trying to prevent drug addicts from doing what they are going to do, anyway? Why are we allowing criminal gangs, who are as violent and sadistic and without conscience as any terrorist group, to have so much sway? Why don't we legalize and regulate and tax drugs and let Darwinian laws take their course with the addict population? Why don't we let Uncle Sam reap the profit of human weakness, rather than criminals?""""The Infiltrator,"" unlike the 2000 film ""Traffic,"" never asks that question.

38,abisio,An incredible suspenseful movie that leave you a few open questions,9,16 July 2016,Based on the true story of Robert Mazer; an undercover customs agent that got quite close to Pablo Escobar and incarcerated many people related with drugs traffic and money laundering; this is the type of movie that after a few minutes will keep you nailed to your seat and will not let you breath until the very end.Most of the credit; belongs to the incredible performances by Bryan Cranston and John Leguizamon closely followed by Juliet Aubrey and Diana Kruger as real and fictitious wives and many other secondary characters; but also thanks to the very tight script; and a direction that forcing slow burning pace that make you feel inside the movie.There are however some open questions that the movie barely answer; first of all the CIA involvement but a few things about characters that are not really very clear (specially about Mr. Mazer motives to keep risking his and her family lives).In brief; worth the price of the ticket and your time,The Infiltrator
39,bryank-04844,I'm all in for 'The Infiltrator'!,8,23 January 2017,"We've seen quite a few movies and even TV shows that cover the Pablo Escobar story and his drug cartel over the years. Some have been great where others missed the mark. Here with 'The Infiltrator', you never really see Pablo Escobar, but only in passing as the story follows real-life US agent Robert Mazur or as his undercover name Bob Musella, played by Bryan Cranston, who is no stranger to the drug business (Breaking Bad). Robert Mazur went deep undercover to unlock and take down Pablo Escobar's drug business, along with his right hand men.What director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer, Runner Runner) does here that makes this film stand apart from the rest in this genre, is strictly focus on the tension of going undercover in this nasty cartel business. There are some fairly intense moments of brutal killings and violence, but that all takes a back seat as we see all the moving parts come together to make this a successful operation, by showing how Mazur balances his home life, creating fake aliases and marriages, to even opening up bank accounts and becoming very friendly with the deadliest of Pablo Escobar's crew.You'll be on the edge of your seat for sure throughout the whole film, hoping that Cranston's character isn't figured out. Speaking of Cranston, he does a phenomenal job as Robert Mazur and the ruthless businessman Bob Musella. It was almost like a return to the 'Breaking Bad' character of Walter White and Heisenberg, where one was a good family man and the other was a volatile and scary individual. It's a little more toned down here, but it works on all levels. His partner who is also undercover is Emir (John Leguizamo), who always turns in an excellent performance. Emir is the guy who takes all the scary chances here and seems a little unhinged, which also adds to the suspense of the story.Benjamin Bratt and Diane Kruger play great supporting roles as well, but Cranston and Leguizamo shine bright here. Their struggles with keeping their separate lives from their undercover ones are rough, and you can see that it truly takes a toll on them. Oh and Olympia Dukakis makes an appearance in the film and just steals the show every time she's on screen. Put her in everything! The music choices are fun and spot on for the time period and the direction is gritty, which adds that extra layer of tension. 'The Infiltrator' is a fresh look at this overly-done story and comes highly recommended!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The Infiltrator
40,mikayakatnt,The 'Narcos' Wannabe,5,10 March 2020,"An alright-at-best crime drama that rode the coattails of the success of ""Narcos.""The Infiltrator has a deserving cast but the screenplay does the film no justice. Nothing differentiates this film from the many other films of the genre. In fact, this film tends to be more boring than most films within the genre.Some characters come off as unconvincing and get introduced too fast. So much is going on that people not paying attention will lose track. Some deaths are so over-the-top that it breaks the suspension of reality.Not to mention too many names and factual events were switched for dramatic purposes. These artistic liberties are so blatant at times that they were too close for comfort.I would give this a 3/5. But -.5 for habitual changing of factual events.2.5/5: Average & quickly forgettable. A bit more work on the screenplay would have gone a far, far way.",The Infiltrator
41,brankovranjkovic,Feels Like a Made for TV Movie,5,22 September 2016,"I love factual films, so was compelled to see this billed as based on true events.Set in the mid 1980's, Bryan Cranston goes undercover as Robert Mazur who brings down the Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar and the corrupt bank (BCCI), the bank that launders truly enormous (in the billions) sums of money.Not a terrible film but the storyline has been done many times and I couldn't help thinking the film didn't deliver anything particularly new. Not an outstanding film with very few memorable scenes, the only that comes to mind is the anniversary cake scene.If you're a Bryan Cranston fan you'll enjoy this. However, if you want to see a film based on the war on drugs then there are better examples, for instance, the fantastic 'Sicario (2015)', or to a lesser degree and with a comedy edge 'American Hustle'.",The Infiltrator

Is it to tell us that undercover cops sometimes cross the line in friendships? Already done...""Donnie Brasco"" or that the United States had funded the drug trade in order to set up secret wars? Yep ""Traffic."" So what's left. Sorry, bones picked waaay too clean by vultures.The message then becomes...drug dealers are people too. I do enjoy the darkest of humors, as when the sting of the century has unsuspecting criminals celebrating but not realizing they are seconds away from collapse, but the real fun is watching Leguizamo skirt the dirtbags he has to use and befriend in order to get his own adrenaline high.

46,dvc5159,Breaking Good,6,15 July 2016,"Bryan Cranston is not your typical movie star, although he seems like it. Underneath the cool-high-school-dad exterior, there's an actor of great depth and unexpected power. You'll know it when you see a scene involving his character, said character's wife, and a restaurant on their anniversary dinner. Cranston seems to have benefited during his years as Walter 'Heisenberg' White on TV's Breaking Bad. And it has contributed greatly in this biographical crime thriller, about as straightforward and predictable as a stab in the gut.Yes, Brad Furman's (The Lincoln Lawyer, Runner Runner) directorial efforts here will not be known for their signature riffs, as there is none to speak of. It's standard thriller fare, the kind that would do well had it been released between the late 1980s and early 1990s; pure genre fare that caters to mostly adult film-goers that aren't interested in seeing computer-generated superpowers or rubble. In other words, unoriginal yet mature, grown-up stuff.The Infiltrator, however, is textbook example of how great casting can elevate shopworn genre material into solid entertainment, as the always-reliable Cranston has proved here. Sure, he is strongly supported by a bevy of intriguing cast members including Benjamin Bratt, John Leguizamo and the lovely Diane Kruger; but in portraying real-life undercover agent Robert Mazur shimmying his way up through Pablo Escobar's criminal empire, Cranston's understated but strong everyman presence confidently carries the movie solely. That quality alone replaces the tediousness often found in similar true-crime movies with an intense amount of uneasy suspense and grounded credibility, providing lots of fun for Cranston fans as long as they do not expect anything groundbreaking.Breaking Good, indeed.",The Infiltrator
47,Rendanlovell,Most lifeless movie of the year.,3,16 July 2016,"If I had an award to give for the most disengaging movie of year I would give it to this movie. Right now. I wouldn't even wait till I've seen all the movies that I want to in 2016. Because this is probably the most bland, heartless movie I have ever seen. Which is something I never thought would happen in a Bryan Cranston movie. The movie is about a government Infiltrator. He is given the task of going undercover in one of the biggest mobs in history and break them apart. With this kind of source material it would seem impossible to make a boring movie. You have an R rating, one of the best actors working, and one of the craziest true stories ever.And you did the very thing no one could have imagined. You made one of the dullest mob films I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. The only reason I am not calling this one of the hands down worst films of the year is because of Mr. Cranston. Who, despite the garbage he is working with, turns in a typically excellent performance.Every else does a pretty great job as well. But this is one movie that proves that an ensemble cast means nothing when the movie around them sucks. You'd think going into a film like this that there would be stakes, or tension. But there isn't, at all. Even scenes where bad dudes are looking over a briefcase filled with recording equipment don't land. Why? Because that scene lasts less than ten seconds.You can't expect people to feel nervous about what is happening when the person looking over the case doesn't even touch it. He looks at it from a distance for a few seconds and clears it. Where's the tension in that? Moments like this plague the film. Anytime actual conflict arises it stays for so short a time that it doesn't feel remotely nerve racking. The makers put these moments in the film to make you nervous right? So, why do they mean nothing to the rest of the film? This mans whole career is based around secrecy and going with the flow. But when the entire film feels scripted there is nothing to get invested in. It doesn't feel like the bad guys are controlling anything. It feels like Cranston could have done whatever he wanted to them. If he asked them to handcuff themselves and walk into a prison cell, I'm confident they would have done it. It was so incredibly boring to watch. Even when it tries to show how the job is affecting his family life, it's bland. That has everything to do with the absolutely atrocious characters. There's no one to care about here in the slightest. I was constantly waiting for some one to die so that we could really see who these people were and how would react to that but that moment never came. Not only does this movie feel artificial and generic but it plays everything so safe. Despite being in the middle of a mob that prides themselves in cutting people up you never see anything like that. So how can we be invested in our main character or his ""struggle""? This disregard of storytelling is only highlighted by it's run time, which feels ten times longer than the two hours it claims to clock in at. There is so much that this film does wrong it actually blew me away. Among all the reasons I listed there's also a by the numbers soundtrack, poor direction, and an utter disregard to small details. When your film is mostly meant to be character driven and every one of them is a walking blank slate then you have a big problem. The only saving grace is Cranston and his incredibly convincing performance. Aside from that, this is easily the most lifeless, bland film that I seen all year.",The Infiltrator
48,eshwarmail,"May not be your best true story backed crime drama, a great story and good acting makes it watchable",6,25 February 2017,"I don't think there is any dispute when one says that Bryan Cranston's career took off into the A-lists after the stupendous success of Breaking Bad. He has been working in some very big movies in roles tailored for him. To a man in his position, it is easy to get swayed into accepting big money meaningless roles that would have come thick and fast post his stardom. Bryan Cranston didn't budge. Instead he used this same stardom and new found influence to get him into doing some very interesting roles and gave very passionate performances to further his legacy in acting. Pablo Escobar's drug empire might not be a very sophisticated one. It was more or less operated by may be intelligent but rather uneducated people. They followed procedures and people what the best money or intimidation could buy. In such duress, you don't get innovation - you only get workarounds. There were numerous attempts by dedicated DEA and Customs teams to poke at this clunky model and dismantle the operations, but with the reach and the money generating prowess of its business, ten more such models would crop up just as one goes down. 'The Infiltrator' is based on a real life account of one such operation, a rather successful one.Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) is a U.S. Customs Officer and is a veteran in undercover operations. The mission starts off to collect evidence against some higher members of Escobar's echelon along with his trusted associate Emir (John Leguizamo). Soon the dynamics change and the mission gets bigger with members of the cartel getting very interested with Mazur's proposal. The need to find a bank which could be talked into doing the laundering work for them arises which is when the BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) steps in. With the evidence mounting up, his life constantly in danger, personal life in shambles, he has to find a way to bring all players under a single roof for indictments.Being made from a real life account of Robert Mazur, one would imagine the story to be opinionistic and highly perspective. However the makers had made sure they take an objective route in telling their story but does indulge in some personal views of Mazur. The idea of choosing BCCI (the biggest product of Pakistan on international stage) amongst many other options isn't well shown. The direction is upbeat especially with John Leguizamo's histrionics and members of Medellin cartel's lifestyle. It has Bryan Cranston playing the lead and another seasoned Hollywood actress Diane Kruger playing a crucial role, with everything going for it - there seems to be something missing throughout the movie making it incomplete. The attention to detail for the period is done well, the background score always is high spirited and apt, the color theme and cinematography adds into the period feel. It has its moments of emotional depth where the characters of Mazur and Kathy (Diane Kruger) has to walk a thin line between the new friendships they are making and the knowledge of the fact that they are also collecting evidence to eventually bust them. Considering the story is backed by a real life account which already has a huge conspiracy undertone, intriguing twists and involves a popular figure like Escobar looming over it - I felt the resulting movie could have been a little more engaging than it turned out to be.May not be your best true story backed crime drama, a great story and good acting makes it watchable.",The Infiltrator
49,asifahsankhan,"Bryan Cranston dazzles, but the crime thriller, ultimately misses the punch!",7,10 April 2017,"Once Breaking Bad was over, Bryan Cranston became a somewhat unlikely Hollywood leading man scoring an instant Best Actor nomination for the biopic drama Trumbo.He's returning to his secretive crime sweet-spot with The Infiltrator but instead of playing the crook, he takes on the role as an undercover cop looking to break into a massive drug cartel that stretches all the way to Pablo Escobar and take it down from the inside.There's no denying that the 1980s-set story of Bob Mazur is a riveting one and, given its basis in truth, one that should be told. It should end up as some sort of Scarface/Donnie Brasco hybrid but when all is said and done, The Infiltrator lacks the power of either.When Mazur gets close to Escobar's top lieutenant Roberto Alcaino (an excellent Benjamin Bratt), the emotions should've been running high and the scene set for a Greek tragedy but director Brad Furman's story is too on the level to resonate deeply.Put simply, The Infiltrator lacks emotion. It tells the story of an undercover agent who goes undercover and does his job quite well. It sidesteps true conflict and thus fails to stay memorable outside of the odd nicely photographed scene. Cranston gives it his all, further establishing his reputation as a dependable leading man. It's a shame that the rest of the film fails to match his ambition.",The Infiltrator
50,bastos,Not a fan of based on a true story movies,6,30 April 2020,"I just recently started reviewing movies on IMDB, and this is the first of many movies I will undoubtedly have the same issue with. These, supposedly, based on a true story or a biopic or something like that, where it gets the Hollywood treatment and over dramatize everything to make it more exciting. This is one of those. All it manages to do is take a really good story and make it a cliched mess where everything is forgettable and you roll your eyes as you know that almost nothing happened as it is portrayed. And what bugs me in these kind of movies is that the changes are not even necessary. In this movie, for example, (SPOILERS) all the arrests are done during a wedding, when in reality they happened the night before, where everyone was led to believe they were going to a big party that ended up being jail. They even went in limos! Wouldn't it be as engrossing as the way it is portrayed here? Why change it then? Nevertheless it is a good story and well acted by everyone involved.",The Infiltrator
51,Jared_Andrews,The Infiltrator Has An Originality Problem,6,22 July 2017,"The Infiltrator is a familiar movie with familiar characters, a familiar plot, and familiar twists. While watching this movie, you may find yourself thinking, ""this is all fine, but it seems like something is missing."" That something is originality.The movie has a sizable originality problem. With each passing scene, you will notice previously used tropes from Donnie Brasco (the infiltrator empathizing with criminals while undercover) and The Departed (the infiltrator struggling to withstand the emotional burdens of the job), to name a few. Trust me, there are plenty more. This could work fine if the filmmakers infused the story with at least a few drops of their own special sauce, but this isn't the case.The lack of originality could have also been overcome if this movie managed to reach the quality levels of its predecessors (a tall task, for certain). To do this the movie required some intensity, some sequences that evoked raw emotional responses from viewers. This never happens. At no point are we led to feel that the infiltrator is any real danger.Additionally, the execution needed to be crisp and consistent. It wasn't. Instead it often felt disjointed. The scenes often lacked coherent transitions so we were left watching the infiltrator interacting with various groups of characters who have no clear connection to one another until the final few scenes. Even then there is no big payoff or surprise. It is, once again, unoriginal.Despite its flaws, the movie is certainly not a total miss. Bryan Cranston showcases his acting authority once again. His brightest displays account for the movie's strongest moments. One particular scene with Cranston and his wife at dinner will be remembered. (That clip is worth watching on Youtube, if you plan to skip the movie.) Still, Cranston could only do so much. Don't blame him for this one; I certainly do not. Though he admirably trudges along, at times appearing very aware of the movie's clichés, he can't completely mask the movie's stale flavor. What we are left with is something resembling leftover pizza from a great pizza place that has been microwaved the next day. It's fine. There's still something wonderful there. But it's unmistakably un-fresh. And it ultimately leaves you unsatisfied.",The Infiltrator

53,happy_hangman,Great Character-Turn from Mr C,7,17 October 2016,"'The Infiltrator' is a slick piece of work, which suffers a little from the real-life protagonist's influence on undercover-cop dramas on film and TV over the past three decades. Many of the tricks employed by real-life protagonist Robert Mazur in taking down Pablo Escobar's drug-trafficking and money-laundering network in the '80s are familiar to us as tropes of this niche sub-genre ever since Michael Mann first used him as a consultant on 'Miami Vice'. Art imitates life, providing a facsimile of life, in infinite recursion. What makes the film effective is Bryan Cranston's turn as the titular hero, though the narrowness of focus on the conflicted Mazur does leave Diane Kruger, John Leguizamo and, most notably, Benjamin Bratt somewhat isolated, and in need of character development. They are defined almost exclusively in terms of their specific relationship with Cranston – a shame, as a greater scope and more expansive historical context (one gets the impression, on occasion that this has been a conscious strategy to avoid classification as a period piece) might have turned a good, solid thriller – for all my gripes, still better than most crime dramas we've seen of late - into a genuinely great film.

54,SpoilerAlertReviews,"A glossy, slick bio but loses focus and impact",7,19 September 2016,"Brad Furman directs a biographical account of U.S. Customs official Robert 'Bobby' Mazur on his war against drug cartel directly connected to Pablo Escobar. Breaking Bad super star Bryan Cranston plays Bobby, the undercover agent risking his retirement on one final bust, one of the largest in U.S. Customs history. We follow him going deep cover making friends with all the wrong kind of people creating a suspenseful atmosphere, however this isn't The Departed level of tense, not even Donnie Brasco, but there's plenty of close-calls and shocking incidents to keep you intrigued. We witness the inner conflict, the guilt of betrayal and the dangers and brutality one would face doing such a job. The films has two of my favourite co-stars, John Leguizamo, who is great as the very talented but equally obnoxious undercover lead and Benjamin Bratt as cartel money man, Roberto Alcaino. Bratt appears to age perfectly, becoming quite the distinguished gentleman especially looking back at his younger self in films like Demolition Man and Blood In, Blood Out. The stunning Diane Kruger does great as Bobby's cover fiancé, this surely enhancing her fame. There's a strong British cast including Brit soap, Emmerdale's Joseph Gilgun, Jason Isaacs, Tim Dutton, Daniel Mays and Snatch's heavy, Andy Beckwith. Also among the casting is True Lies bad guy Ark Malik playing banker along with Saïd Taghmaoui and B-Movie star Michael Paré. Oscar winner Olympia Dukakis ironically gives an ""Oscar winning performance"" as a shill to the whole operation. A good mixture on the soundtrack but an unnoticeable score from Chris Hajian with iconic tracks from Curtis Mayfield, The Who and Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows. The production of the film is very good from the locations, lighting being purposefully hazy and the costumes are on point. Like his previous films, Runner Runner and the Lincoln Lawyer, it's hits just above average, not being a bad film but not a great film either. It's entertaining enough and there's some great cinematography, especially the long take at the conclusion which posed as a recap for the story's key characters. Though the film is superbly shot, I feel it loses it's focus, are we suppose to sympathise with the cartel? And though tense in parts, it loses it's impact very quickly, even for 127min running time, which fortunately, doesn't drag and moves at a steady pace. It's a glossy, slick and captivating thriller with all round good performances and sharp editing/directing. But as said before, it lacks the emotional impact to have any lasting affect.

This involves a money laundering scheme involving the BCCI bank in London and this is the trail Musella is following. This is okay, kind of bland, slow moving, no real violence as one would expect and has the feel of a made-for-TV-movie. Bryan Cranston is very good and he has those facial expressions - all the way through - that tells us he is waiting for the other shoe to drop and all will be lost. He is the main reason we feel tension throughout. Musella knows that if he doesn't do a good job convincing the Cartel that he can help releasing millions the US government is holding that he, his family and anyone else connected to him will be killed in a most brutal way. The operative words here are ""a most brutal way"" and this registers with Mazur as Musella in a very big way. Musella's cover is almost blown when Yul Vazquez as Javier sees the recorder in Musella's brief case. Oh, oh!Notables that gave excellent performances: Diane Kruger as Kathy, Mazur's set-up fiancé; John Leguizamo as Emir, Mazur's partner; Olympia Dukakis as Musella's aunt; and Yul Vazquea as Javier an Escobar go-between. However the two notables that really came through with above par solid performances were Carsten Hayes as Rudy (and may have been Pablo Escobar although this wasn't too clear), and Benjamin Bratt as Roberto, who is Escobar 's second in command, and who probably stole the show from Bryan Cranston.

56,stonedraim,Sophisticated narcotics undercover.,6,31 October 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.In typical Hollywood productions, there is generally always twists and tweaks on the story, the production and the screen play (when based on authentic material) to make the picture more heavy and entertaining in sense of giving the audience a enjoyable time. In ""The Infiltrator"", it seems the other way around. They are telling a story about a bust that were playing of the string of tension, and yet conveyed in a ordinary and straight forward both path and matter. In that way that it almost sometimes becomes to similar to reality, which the writer, director and the production team surely wanted. They did that in a good way, and it is fresh to watch such a motion picture.There is generally always some things that gives the movie away that it is good, maybe a little more, and stays there instead of reaching for the top notch rate. One of those things is when the casting crew has casted actors that has strong facial similarities. Two women in here is placed within that category; the wife ""Ev"" and Roberto Alcainos (Benjamin Bratt) wife. This certain kind of element creates negative confusion, and I asked myself more than twice how the women could be in two different places at the same time, and why they suddenly acted as they met for the first time... which, in the movies story, they did. Fiction dimension fault.I recommend ""The Infiltrator"", as it shows another side of the dangerous missions the infiltrators has. Mentioned before; they did it in a simple and ""down-to-earth"" kind of way here.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : There is a yellow nuance of colour throughout the entire production that gives it a special emotion, that also pinpoints the era in which it was displayed. - The actors : Main character played by Bryan Cranson is getting the feelings and emotions through, as he travels between the worlds of criminal drug organizations and being a family man. - Entertainment : Do you want a true story about an infiltrators life bringing down a huge upset in the drug industry? Then watch this. - Age : 15. Violence, drugs and mature transparency in psychological aspects.6,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

58,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 80,8,21 July 2016,"There are many reasons to like The Infiltrator. It takes place in the '80s, it's suspenseful, and it gives us a really gritty inside look at what life is like for a good guy who goes undercover to work with the Colombian drug cartel.Which is what Bryan Cranston's character does. He's a guy on the verge of retirement and could easily leave to spend time with his wife and kids, but takes this one last job. And it proves to be the toughest one yet as he poses as a money launderer to try and take down Pablo Escobar's entire drug trafficking network.It takes place in the Reagan-'80s and so there's this whole overt camera filter over the whole film. It's not too distracting, but it's also not terribly necessary. But it's minor.The whole thing plays out as one giant sting operation. And the filmmakers understand that in a 2 hour movie, you don't need to run through all the details in one quick dialogue-filled scene. However, it would've been nice if they had given us a little more along the way.It starts unraveling a little over an hour in. There's about a 30 minute stretch where you're looking at the person sitting next to you saying, ""What's happening?"" There's a lot left unexplained, but I guess there was more concern about the movie not becoming any longer.The film is long at 127 minutes, but it's never really an issue. We need the time to process what's happening and for Cranston's character to evolve over the course of the film.It tightens back up in the home stretch, culminating in an emotionally impressive final scene.The always-under-appreciated John Leguizamo plays Cranston's partner and does a very good and believable job.There seems to be this slightly neglected theme intermittently placed throughout the film about the American economy collapsing without laundered money.

They make a great team and clearly hold the film up. Everyone else is forgettable.Script: Like a tired cliché. We care most about family says one of our villains while cutting vegetables with a sharp knife. The closeness that Cranston develops with the mob is never actually visualized and it happens all too quickly. Cranston and Leguizmo sell a very disconnected script. There are also holes that are bizarre and unexplained such as Cranston being followed to his real home, yet this is never brought up in the film.Cinematography: Just fine, nothing memorable nothing obtrusive.Music: Ditto.Summary: A by the numbers supposedly true story of the takedown of one of the greatest drug kingpins in history, Pablo Escobar. Cranston is charismatic, very capable and very likable. But the script seems to make it incredibly hard to get to Escobar one moment and then like a hot knife through butter during the next moment. It's an enjoyable performance by this duo but it won't stand up to repeat viewings. Well worth the entertainment price but that's about it.

The villains generally felt a bit one dimensional, but I did really enjoy Benjamin Bratt's performance, equal parts icy and charming.The direction was tight, and the pacing was generally on point, but I felt that this lacked the visceral quality that Narcos achieved so well, and couldn't really play for humour in the same way as American Made.This doesn't result in a bad film, but one that for me is ultimately lacking enough of an edge to really define it in the genre.",The Infiltrator

The guy is lucky to still be alive and walking the streets today. Two thumbs up ! Most likely this movie won't be at the regular theater's unless it takes off. It will be Netflix material soon.

66,ericnottelling,enough to hold your interest but nothing memorable,7,30 September 2016,"I had been waiting to watch this movie for some time so when I finally did I was really stoked to check it out. Bryan Cranston in the movie definitely peaked my interest as he did a really great job in Breaking Bad. Let me start by saying I thought the production value of this movie was excellent. The retro vibe in the movie really helps sell it and in some sense is almost comical. Those huge 80s cell phones, the awkward 80s clothes, it really helps sell this movie and create a nice vibe. However past that there really seems to be something missing from this movie. The first part of it starts out rather well. For the most part in the beginning of the movie the acting is done well and the story seems to move along at a decent pace. However toward the last 1/3 of the move it really seems like we are simply going through motions from A to B to C. And while they are able to sell some thing to the viewer in the movie, a good deal of what they were hoping for seems to be lacking. They really try to sell this idea that the main characters get caught up and attached vibe in the last 1/3 of the movie. However neither the script nor the acting really pulls that off. You never really have this sense that he is sucked in and almost guilty for being an agent. They try hard to sell it in the script but the emotional attachment simply wasn't there. There is a line at the end of the movie that really makes the failure stand out as one character says ""none of your real friends went to jail today"" But at no time was there any real belief that any sort of real relationship developed. Which leaves the viewer with the reality that the whole movie is just a string of scenes from A to Z but no dynamic or character development. There are two kinds of scenes in a movie. The 1st kind moves the movie forward. The second kind tells us something important about a character. There is plenty of the 1st kind in this movie. The second kind really seems to be lacking. For that reason I gave the movie a 7/10. It's an interesting story and going from point A to point Z will keep you entertained. But after watching it you will realize nothing really memorable happened in the movie and that it was just kind of a bland movie.",The Infiltrator

All of the actors were very good, but it was a story not worth telling. We've seen this story before, but it was told much better every time. Everything was on the surface.

69,tyingling7766,"Great acting, but just a bit flat in places",7,5 October 2017,"I really wanted to give this movie a better rating. It had everything you could want in a procedural drama, even if it wasn't based on a true story. Like every true story I talk about, there is no idea how much of the story is true or not, but it this one is enjoyable.The acting was spot on in this movie. Bryan Cranston shined as he always does. John Leguizamo was as good as he's ever been. You can never go wrong with Diane Kruger. The one complaint I do have is that Benjamin Bratt played a character he seems to be getting stuck with in this point of his career. The man is a versatile actor, stop putting him in drug dealer roles. Give him some space to shine.You probably already know the story even if you haven't seen or heard of the movie. A man in the government decides he's going to go undercover to infiltrate a cartel. It's not like that type of movie hasn't been done before this incident happened in the mid 1980's or after. Or we have seen it on screen. At least with this one they kept it grounded. Robert Mazur didn't go native or anything. He tried to keep his business and his personnel life different.One thing I did love about the movie was a subtle grittiness they put in the filming. It seemed everything was hazy when they were filming, and it worked for the time period they were working off of. The 80's were gritty and hazy. Depicting that in the movie was a brilliant idea. I wish other movies from periods would do such a thing.Now, for the thing that hurt the movie for me. There were a bunch of little factors involved. Things you would notice if you were paying attention. The one that stood out was that there was no crescendo involved throughout the entire movie. There was no build up to a big event. It all felt extremely flat the entire time.If it wasn't for the acting I probably would have given this movie a lower rating, truthfully. And the acting alone should be enough to watch this movie.Rating: 7 out of 10That's it for me folks.",The Infiltrator

As usual, he is excellent in this movie. I don't have a problem with any of the actors, they all deliver. The problem comes from trying to adapt a very specific and detailed book into a ninety minute movie. Adapating a screenplay from a movie is so difficult. When you have read the book you have a detailed understanding of the story. The problem is as you make the movie, you assume that the audience has that same background and understanding, we don't. There are numerous parts in this film where I was scratching my head and saying who is that or what just happened? I am a fairly intelligent guy, but I did not read the book, so, you have to introduce me to some characters and plot points that you have provided no background on. That or make a ten hour movie.

76,pelhamc,Escobar Season Has Returned!,5,15 October 2016,"The Infiltrator is a feature film in the crime genre. It's the true story of US Customs Agent Robert Mazur, an uc who helped bring down notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, with an elaborate sting. It's Donnie Brasco meets Miami Vice. Nothing ruins a film more than bad casting. Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Trumbo) plays Mazur, a Jew playing Italians. He was good in Breaking Brad, but this is ""Tim Watley"" we're talking about. Cranston is one of the most WASPy actors out there. John Leguizamo (Chef, Carlito's Way) would have been a much better choice, but he's relegated to the role of the crazy sidekick. He shines in it. Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone, Central Intelligence) makes a cameo as the tough-talking Commanding Officer. She's a great actress, but it was a bit part. The plot was predictable and derivative. Deep cover, Mazur assumes an identity and lives it, all the while growing attached to his his new ""friends"" he is using to make the case. It's warmed over leftovers. Nor did I buy Cranston as a criminal. He worked as Walter White, because the character was supposed to be stiff and nerdy. Bryan Cranston comes off that way in everything he does. Pablo Escobar is a name in criminology. They seemed to use that more as an attention grabber, as he is not really a character in the story. Diane Kruger plays Mazur's fake fiancé, but she looks like an actress. Her character talks out of turn and lays it on too thick, thereby calling attention to herself and almost blowing their covers. Yet, Mazur takes this surprisingly well for a man with his life on the line. Customs comes off as heroic, bankers evil, natch. There was cliché odd couple cop-buddy pairing (""by the book"" versus ""loose cannon""). The ""where are they now"" segment indicated a lasting friendship between the partners, but they never really bond in the picture. You also wonder why with all of their resources, risk, and paranoia the drug dealers don't bother with background checks. I also didn't get why if you're doing some illegal business, you have to meet the top guy--unless you're an infiltrator. The juxtaposition during the climax scene was very Godfather ripoff and it's been done to death. The Infiltrator flopped like Escobar on Entourage. There was nothing original here.",The Infiltrator

Thanks to Netflix, Pablo Escobars name has become popular among viewers, from documentaries about Escobar to the famous Narcos TV series following Pablos life in the Colombian drug trade. Infiltrator follows Robert( Bobby) a family man by day and dirty money launderer by night. Bobby is determined to catch the big dogs and that means taking down Escobars money laundering business. What makes this interesting is that as Bobby gets deeper and deeper into the game, you see him wonder if he can really play it. I mean, with strippers, drugs, late nights, and the random killings that come with the territory, you admire why he is there in the first place. A scene I liked was when he had to totally pretend his wife was his Assistant on their Anniversary and actually showed his wife the face that he hides when he isn't home. Let's not forget his fake fiancé, played by Diane Kruger, who used her charm and good looks to accompany Musella through the whole operation.

80,moritzmeyerautor,"Gripping and full of suspense, while feeling totally realistic and grounded",8,6 February 2017,"This is a movie, that will have you at the edge of your seat. And it doesn't rely on cheap tricks to get you there, like the ticking clock of a near terrorist attack or family members of our hero being taken by the bad guys. The suspense comes from the plot itself and the actions of the main characters, which seem to be too daring to be true; and yet they are. The movie starts with undercover cop Robert Mazur, played by Bryan Cranston, in the final stage of an operation. After his job is done, he is offered an opportunity to retire and live a life on a yacht with his family ""or whatever white people do, when they retire"", as John Leguizamos character puts it in one the funnier moments of the film. But then he is given a chance to work himself right into the heart of Pablo Escobars drug cartel; not by following the drugs, but by following the money. So he takes on the role of mobster Robert Musella and finds himself in a situation, where the just slightest mistake, ""just one slip"", could get himself and his undercover colleagues killed. It's this razor's edge situation, that makes ""The Infiltrator"" so compelling and gripping. It is based on a true story and you can clearly see, that Bryan Cranston, who is credited as executive producer as well, is very invested in the material. His performance of a performance is awesome, but luckily the movie doesn't rest on his shoulders alone. John Leguizamo, Benjamin Bratt and the fabulous Diane Kruger do a fantastic job as well. One of the greatest achievements of the movie is, that it feels no need to exaggerate the story. There is a scene, in which Bryan Cranston's character is in the kitchen with one of the main bad guys preparing dinner. This conversation alone is so full of heavy tension, Benjamin Bratt could slice it with the knife, he is using in that particular scene in remarkable fashion. It is fantastic acting and movie direction and that is just one example of many similar scenes. The plot of The Infiltrator sure isn't one, we haven't seen before in movies.

Of particular concern are a number of short scenes, edited so as to leave the audience dangling. ""What just happened?"" could be the call. The ""old aunt's story"" is particularly odd. I very much appreciated the possible infidelity not happening. In fact, Cranston and his wife are given a complex relationship that becomes even more complex.

The movie will have your attention from the very first minute and does a great job of building the suspense throughout. The POV chosen for this film is a refreshing take considering the plethora of drug related undercover movies. Diane Kruger's quick thinking in many scenes was delivered with aplomb and panache. The depiction of Bryan Cranston losing his real self and his marriage and getting too self-absorbed in the undercover alias of Bob Mysella is really good too!What I didn't like -
The production value as well the acting in this movie has been great. However, there isn't all that much happening in the movie. Sure, Bob Musella helps to bring some of the bad guys down, but there isn't that much of infiltrating happening which makes the movie lack a bit in terms of suspense and direction.",The Infiltrator

The variety of settings for this films made it enjoyable and as it was set in the 80's there was plenty of nostalgia there which is always good to see!

90,samukaresma,If you're into the genre: worth checking out.,7,12 October 2016,"The Infiltrator, directed by Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) and written my his writer-mom, Ellen Brown Furman. The movies is based on Rober Mazur's autobiography of the time when he was working as an undercover in the 80's. Mazur played as a corrupt businessman that infiltrated the Pablo Escobar's money laundering organization. On the main roles we see the great Bryan Cranston, probably most well known from the TV series Breaking Bad, and Diane Kruger, who plays Mazur's undercover partner. You'll know her most likely from Inglourious Basterds and National Treasure.The strongest aspect of the movie definitely is the acting. Cranston does amazing job here with all his micro expressions, which makes his acting very real and live-like. The character development is good and you do really grow onto the characters, caring for them, which makes the intense and exciting scenes more so - you don't want them to get caught.The true crime story genre has is a difficulties: the makers have to balance between believable, but maybe boring and dramatized, but not-so- believable, and I think they took one step to the wrong direction here. It can be a bit boring at few times and I missed some more drama and exciting moments. Do we really want to see what actually happened? Not always. I think documentary is for that, a movie should be a bit dramatized.From here we get to the worse parts of the movie: I think it was slightly too long, I one time had the thought: ""hmm, how long is this gonna last again"", which is in my book, not really a good thing. The pacing seemed also a bit off sometimes, as it seemed to jump from events to other and following the movie, at least at the start, was a bit difficult, if you didn't focus on it all the time. New characters were introduced pretty quick, and you were left wondering, who is this guy? What does he do? What does it matter to the story? It did, however, get better till the end.In short: it's a good movie. If you like true story based undercover crime movies, this is a good one to check out. It was intense and exciting enough at moments, though could have been more of that at some scenes. Just don't expect an action movie, but a movie about characters, especially Cranston's one, in which we get to see how he grows and changes as a person, when he needs to live in the grim business world of drugs.Personally, I'd give it 4/5, but more subjective rating from me would be 3,5 out of 5 stars (or 7/10). In it's genre, there are better options, so that's why I didn't want to raise it onto the same level with them. If you like precisely the true story based undercover criminal movie type, this is worth checking out, but if the genre is a bit off, I guess you will see some flaws in it.The half star comes, because I don't want to drop it among the mediocre mass production stuff either. It has flaws, but is still solid and watchable, if you like the style.Thanks for reading, and be sure to check more reviews at https://radioaktiivistajatetta-en.blogspot.com",The Infiltrator

92,jfa42,A decent but lazy effort by Furman!,5,20 May 2017,"The Infiltrator is a terrific story that ends up only being a decent little picture because filmmaker Brad Furman drops the ball in some key areas. First off, the opening 45 minutes feel like every single drug/undercover/gangster picture you've ever seen all rolled up into one. If I told you the filmmakers chose to use the Curtis Mayfield song Pusherman, would I have to say anymore? Wow guys, really? Along those lines, this film takes place smack dab in the middle of the 80's but feels like a rehash of every 70's drug film. If one just looks at the 80's as some cheesy period, then it will be so... If one looks at it as a lively time w/ new music- 2nd British invasion, new design, some cool fashion aspects (and some cheesy) and some continued sexual experimentation. (The bi-sexual adviser to Escabor fit right in the times, too bad they kind of squandered the chance to do more w/ him.) Look no further than here for a great primer on the time period: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GG0MR5E#_swftext_Swf At bare minimum, the musical cues were awful, nothing even remotely 80's like at all. Eminence Front by The Who, that's your 80's tune? A classic rock icon of the 60's and 70's and from a record in 1982. A great Rush tune, Tom Sawyer, 1981, opens the film and sets the tempo for a nice scene. It would be okay to open w this but to bookend end w/ another classic rocker indicates the filmmakers had no regard or feel for the period. Try Depeche Mode, Yaz, PiL, hell Bauhaus or Love & Rockets for something edgier. Try something that at least evokes the period... There are a ton of mis steps just like it. For instance, Mom's are great, I bet Brad's Mom is especially awesome. But, letting her write the script? She may be apt to miss things like Wiseguys don't do facial hair (which was more a 70's than 80's thing.) The Wiseguy bodyguard has a big bushy beard, the pic of the real guy at the end of the film clearly illustrates the point. Look no further than here for some Made Man elucidation: https://www.amazon.com/Real-CASINO-Special- Bonus/dp/B008PBCT0A/ In addition, there's a definite sense here that no one associated w/ this film knows anything... and I mean anything about blow. Like uggatz, tho I'm sure Ma Furman loved to dole out mounds of the Colombian marching powder in her day. I mean, there was absolutely no sense of Cocaine permeating this picture at all, none! Just watch how GoodFellas & Casino do it, as Marty clearly did more than dabble. It's egregiously negligent seeing that the film is all about taking down Coke Cartels! And trust me, more than a few of these fellas got high on their own supply, no doubt. Also, it's not as if Ma Furman brought any new, rad feminist sensibility to the pic, it's neutral on the bechdel test at best. It easily could have been so much more. I know Brad's a talented dude, his first films The Take & Lincoln Lawyer were very skillfully crafted, and demonstrated real chops. Even tho the performances were very strong in The Infiltrator, This feels frankly like a wasted, half assed, lazy effort. When folks wanna get it right, they do the work. Take a TV show like Halt & Catch Fire, they really studied to capture the feel of 80's Dallas to get the details right, even renting the aforementioned doc, Warriors of the Discotheque, on the Iconic club of the area designed by Philippe Starck. Cities like Miami, Atlanta, and Dallas went thru a major growth spurt in the 80's, bustling w/ activity and construction, architecture, etc. you get no sense of it in this film, despite shooting in London. it seems they could've a more modern look and feel to the pic. The color scheme and design just screamed 70's!!! Films like these are not easy to make, and every time one gets made that doesn't reach its full potential it Def pisses me off.

Bryan Cranston gives another exceptional performance showing more faces of his wide spectrum of acting talent, because not only is he a federal agent he is convincing as a cop acting as a criminal too. All of the characters along with Robert Mazur are intriguing, such as the colleague of Robert Mazur who enjoys the corruption of being undercover, who does things which most people would never think of but it shows the corruption of how deep he is in, so do we question his character or his operation? And Roberto Alcaino is the criminal in this film who is responsible for a lot of the laundering, but I actually found myself liking his character. Despite his activity he seemed like a genuine person who cared deeply for his close friends and family. It didn't go too much into the deep technical aspects of the cartel's side of the story which I didn't mind. It was more about the detectives getting in deep. And there were minor references to Pablo Escobar so we're aware of him but no one really talks about him very much so it's very secretive which is good because that symbolises how he and his business remained intact for so long, because someone with so much power cannot simply be reached.There was Moments of explosive drama in the film which were not quite anticipated, it has slow pacing in the movie but then gathered momentum in places which was exciting. After these moments it makes you feel less safe in the thick of the story not really knowing where it's going, not knowing who may or may not survive as we get deeper into the core of the operation.There were nice colours in the film. It looked dirty with the colour grading as it was very grainy but somehow contrastingly pretty with tints of green in the night and blues and reds in the clubs etc. In the car Robert is talking to cops with orange and blue tints on each side of his face symbolising the sides to his character, cold and warm.The morality of betrayal was overwhelming. The Infiltrator is the protagonist but in the end, I found myself feeling resentment for what he had done, and I was convinced by Bryan's acting that his character felt it too.",The Infiltrator
94,fraserm74,"Finally, the American side of the Escobar story",7,16 July 2016,"Before buying my tickets for this film, I had mixed feelings on the plot and how suspenseful or emotionally gripping it would be. I thought maybe it would be something that was just dull and far fetched. Within the first 10 minutes, I was proved wrong. The entertainment hits you like a brick wall and the character build, is something truly remarkable. Now note that I've always been a fan of anything Bryan Cranston, but I tried my best to keep a level head and not get all excited just for him. I wanted to be able to take in all aspects without any bias, which I could successfully do because not only was Cranston amazing, but his supporting roles were also great, if not better. John Leguizamo plays Emir, who is Robert Mazur's (Cranston) partner in crime....or should I say justice. These two put on a show together that really shines. The chemistry between them really adds great meaning to the story, and it really shows how strongly they had to depend on each other to work this case out. On the female side of the story, we have Juliet Aubrey, who plays the wife of Cranston, and does a great job at relaying the emotions of a scared and worried wife who is trying to deal with her husband's continuous second life while under cover. In the other corner we have the beautiful and talented Diane Kruger, who plays Cranston's fake fiancé who has to step in when Robert slips up under cover and says something he shouldn't have, endangering them both, and the entire investigation. Lo and behold, Kruger steps in and puts on a performance that is, in my opinion, the highlight of her career. Now I gave this film an 8/10 because it has some imperfections. Mainly because Cranston and Leguizamo just happen to be the luckiest under cover agents in history. Also because the way it ended, didn't really feel satisfying. The action and the suspense was enough to keep me going for weeks, but the ending of the film just left me in a weird rut. However, besides the ending, and the crazy ways these agents avoid death, this movie really delivers and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. It worked so well because I could really feel the dirty drug filled lives these people were living. There were some shocking moments that left me speechless, and moments I could have done without, but overall, it was a wonderful, heart pounding film. I would definitely recommend for everyone to see this. You wont regret it!",The Infiltrator

97,professorscott,Book Is More Engaging,2,14 July 2016,"I am a fan of Cranston which is why I went to see this film. I've felt he chooses projects that are solid pieces of story telling. I immediately felt that had I not read the book many years ago, I would not have known what was happening because the story telling in the movie is very disjointed and somewhat uneven. A huge problem is Cranston's age. He's too old for the role of Mazur. At the time the events took place Mazur would have been about 40, Cranston looks 60. He has young kids, and Diane Kruger is much younger than him. So I didn't buy into the character as being believable as nonfiction.More could have been added to let the audience know what the police department was facing financially to front his undercover operation. That is a key issue to this story. The undercover cost was huge. I was not disappointed that there was not a lot of action, I wanted a film with lots of dialogue but more detailed storytelling so the audience can follow the challenges of the behind- the-scenes undercover operation. I wanted more of the thought process behind Mazur's decision to take on another case instead of retiring when he could. What was his motivation to take on this dangerous assignment? Never saw a dialogue between him and his wife about his motives since this case would take a toll on their family. The film felt like a made for TV on USA Network or the CW, not a Hollywood production. The acting overall is fine, but the dialogue was stiff. Drug world stories can be a yawn but I was expecting it to be much closer to the book which is why the combination of having read the book and liking Cranston so much led me to want to see this film. The movie didn't need more star power than Cranston, Kruger, Dukakis (love all her work) Bratt and Leguizano. Aaron Paul would have made a good Mazur but he's too young - Bob Odenkirk would be the right age and might have been a more interesting choice as Mazur. One detail that was not clear to me was the fate of Pablo Escobar. Cranston would have been better used as a supporting character, someone working with John Leguizamo, and John was great, and he's believable as a drug informant. Kruger was stunning as the fiancé and it's interesting that after this case she never again went undercover. Seems like a smart move since there were some close calls. This won't be the summer hit I thought it would be and it might play well on Netflix or Cinemax. The film looked grainy so that might be challenging for a small screen. Not sure why it was done that way, I found it distracting. Overall not fun movie going experience. If the story of Pablo Escobar is of interest, pick up the book, it's a page turner. The details are worth knowing and one gets the sense of the complications inherent in undercover work and the risks everyone takes. The book also tells of the creative ways drugs are moved from country to country. And more could have been emphasized why following the money, not the drugs, is a better trail to Escobar.",The Infiltrator
98,otstuff,Good but could have been great,7,27 October 2016,"I watched this last night and it was a very enticing movie, but lacked something that could have turned a very good movie into something to be remembered. Brian Cranston and John Leguizamo are both great in their lead and supporting roles. The supporting cast all do very well, the story from what l have read is a good enactment from real life into a movie, but somehow this film always pushes you towards wanting something more, something a little more gripping. Whilst l like the pace of the movie, the character development needed more, the backstory was very quickly done and felt far too pushed through. The directors didn't seem to want to develop the underlying tension between Cranston and Ryan or allow the audience to grow with any of the characters, where you feel the pain, anxiety, pressure.The ending like so many films in Hollywood these days is rushed and feels like an anti-climax. It's not often l say this but the film could have used another 20 minutes or so to add other dimensions that would likely have left you feeling slightly more fulfilled. 7/10",The Infiltrator
99,ParsingHaus,"A touch too long and a touch too whitewashed, but a solid, engrossing, ultimately entertaining sting picture with a truly top-drawer performance by Bryan Cranston.",7,14 July 2016,"Ding-a-ling, and take your seats children because it's time for Oscar-bait semi-thinky semi-sleazy undercover period pieces! You know the type. Some high-wattage actors get all mustached, gold-chained, and spread-collared and take on the eighties. And that's pretty much what happens here. With Bryan Cranston!It's not a great film, but it's a solid genre base hit and entertaining, if a tad too drawn out.On the tail of the successful series Narcos comes The Infiltrator, the story of a slightly less dramatic undercover sting that chased the money, not the coke. Bryan Cranston plays Robert Mazur, a government agent who goes deep as Bob Musella, a mob- connected money launderer. Teaming up with Emir Abreau (John Leguizamo) and his cover-fiancé Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger), Mazur brokers some cash-washing deals between the Medellin folks and a big investment bank, and we follow the trail as it leads deeper in and higher up.The story is based on real-life Mazur's equally real-life book, and frankly isn't terribly interesting (as, to be fair, I suspect many other true bust tales probably are not). And the fact that real-life Mazur wrote the real-life book also presumably accounts for the ultra-pure, good-guy undergirding of Cranston's protagonist in the film. Whitewash? So be it. The victors write the history, and all that.Director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer) tries to spice things up with a dusting of sexual tension between Mazur and his cover girl (will they or won't they?); there's also a feely bromance with Benjamin Bratt, who plays the gleaming, wholesome gentleman of the drug trade. Mazur and Ertz form earnest friendships with Bratt and his family, hinting that when the time comes it might be hard for Mazur to sell his pals down the river.Except it's not. Said friendships feel too forced and phony, and Bratt's genteel drug lord character strains credibility -- he's just too polite and wholesome and nice. There's no real doubt that goodie-goodie Cranston will do the right thing in the end.But that doesn't make The Infiltrator a bad movie. For starters, Cranston is a really terrific actor. Even in a throwaway opening vignette with a bowling alley waitress, his microexpressions just seep realism. His performance here is fantastic, and it's worth watching this movie just for him. The supporting cast is earnest and hardworking and generally believable. There also are some pretty locations, great fashions, flamboyant characters, classic meanies, and crisp shots. It all comes together quite nicely.And then it stays there. The Infiltrator falls short (long?) in its pacing, running probably a half hour past its bedtime. It's perhaps hard to fault Furman for this, given that he was directing from a script his own mother wrote (no joke -- must be a first?). Happy Mother's Day, I left your chaff in my picture! Either way, you might find yourself wondering when time's up.All told, The Infiltrator might not be best of breed, but it's engaging, atmospheric, nicely shot, and offers an interesting take on the 80s drug war -- one with fewer Uzis and drug mules and more middle eastern bankers. Relax and enjoy.",The Infiltrator
100,richteral,Casting is hard.,4,17 January 2021,"So when you miscast the leading couple, the rest is a foregone conclusion. Mr. Cranston seems to suffer through the proceedings, and as he leads, the others follow. It is as if he were pushed from start to finish, without being able to develop any pull at all. There is no scintillating chemistry between him and the young would-be flame, and their scenes carry the malodorous scent of Hollywood kabuki.
A movie for movie´s sake? Just about so.",The Infiltrator
101,mgkhantra,From Meth Cooker to Drug Catcher,8,10 August 2016,"There's certainly been a lot of Bryan Cranston craze since his series Breaking Bad. There's no doubt that this man has a lot of talent and certainly broke that Malcolm in the middle image and shown he's very versatile in that he can take almost any role that hes interested in and just makes it his own. With the Infiltrator this is another which Cranston makes his own and although some might say its almost another kind of criminal/drug dealing sort of adventure the difference this time is that Cranston isn't playing the drug guy but the Drug Catcher.The Infiltrator is based on the real life story of Robert Mazur(whom Bryan plays in this feature); it takes place in the 80's during the Colombian drug trade headed by Pablo Escobar and Mr. Mazurs job as a customs agent is to infiltrate this particular business and stop distribution but at the same time he's having to deal with family and how that affects him going into this undercover operation. The big surprise isn't even him having to lie and infiltrate this organization but having to establish relationships and lie because in doing so he learns about them on a personal level and although these are criminals whom have committed some really horrible crimes there's another side to them mostly just that they're human and do this to protect and provide for their families as much as Mazur is trying to do for his. Mazur gets into the league with these guys and begins infiltrating and finding out as much as he can about them and their operation but when it comes down to busting them can he actually go along with it?Whats interesting about this film is the fact that the relationship angle is built up, Mazur gets invested with these crooks very personally to where they're friends but none as much as his relationship with Roberto(Benjamin Bratt) and his family. You see their motives and how this business affects them(its vital for their family) and even Roberto's wife's view on it. Some aspects of the film itself are some what rehashed from other films (particularly the family aspect whether it's the crime family of the cops family)and indeed I felt a kind of Breaking Bad vibe with this film in how Mazurs work is affecting his family and marriage in particular(though unlike Breaking Bad this was a real situation in BB it was fictional) but I do believe that what makes this one unique is its being able to show both sides of that aspect to where when it gets down to it can you truly bust your own friends that you just made even though that trust was based on a lie. But the performances in this film are really hold this together, watching Bryan Cranston just act in this role is fun and especially since hes in another drug film but on the opposite side with the law busting the bad guys, Benjamin Bratt definitely nails it as Roberto playing the big bad guy and what Benjamin brings to that role.All in all if you need something to watch and would like a good crime film this is definitely one to check out you'll just be glued to your seat with your eyes to the screen every step of the way.",The Infiltrator

What if we chased the money?""""The Infiltrator"", starring Bryan Cranston, follows the fascinating tale of Robert Mazur, a U.S. Customs Agent who goes undercover in a drug cartel. The stakes are extremely high. If Mazur's disguise isn't convincing, he will be brutally tortured and murdered. He, along with his two partners, have to deal with intelligent drug-lords, ruthless thugs, and shrewd businessmen. Watch as the trio concoct risky plans and false identities while avoiding the suspicion of their targets.The severe tension is truly felt through the amazing performances. Cranston steals the show, while Diane Kruger, Benjamin Bratt, and Emir Areu are all top-notch. There are nerve-wracking moments where viewers sincerely fear for the characters' safety. Overall, ""The Infiltrator"" is a riveting and complex movie with great direction and superb acting. If crime-dramas are your cup of tea, I highly recommend watching it.If you found this quick review helpful, please visit LJ's Movie Facts on Facebook.",The Infiltrator
104,seducamedusa,"Meh.., done before and done better",5,23 September 2017,"Don't misunderstand me, it's a solidly acted, directed and produced dramatisation of the events of the time as predictable as it all was. As I said, it's been done before and done better. There's many tales of this type and this is not the worst but is far from the best. And I think that the combined acting chops of Brian Cranston, Diane Kruger, Juliet Aubrey and the irrepressible - John Leguizamo - are what brings this up past a 4-5/10. There were errors in the general styling of the characters, such as the colours and stylings of the nail polishes, the hair styles and even the shoes that Kruger's character wore at the faux wedding. Yeah, perhaps they're small quibbles. The soundtrack didn't save it and yet, I had high hopes when hearing a few riffs of 'Kiss Off' by 'The Violent Femmes' at the beginning. Time appropriate sure, although probably too alternative when trying to tie music to a scene. Remember, we're predominantly in Miami so the soundtrack should've reflected the cocaine fueled nightclub scenes, the general mid 80s vibe of Madonna, Wham!, Phil Collins, etc.,. Horrible yes, but appropriate, nevertheless. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if you're into Cranston, by all means, watch it. If you want a nothing movie to kill 120 minutes of your life, then sure, it's like an extended episode of any cop show but oddly, not Miami Vice. Actually, if you want something worth watching in a similar vein then try 'Donnie Brasco' for a ""buddy was an undercover agent"" story. In 'The Infiltrator', no one seems all that bothered by anything or anyone. Yeah, they say they are and all that but it's all a bit contrived. Predictable, but by the end, I was kind-of hoping that everyone died.",The Infiltrator
105,jlipin,Incredible story but the main actor just doesn't have it,5,27 July 2016,"The trailer for this movie lured me to the theater, and I expected something pretty gritty & thrilling. I've gotta disagree with this casting though. John Leguizamo was SO GOOD. He sold his performance. Gritty, real, and I bought it. Diane Kruger, same thing. But Bryan Cranston? I have no idea what they were thinking. I just didn't buy it. The tension never felt real with his acting. It was so weak. Had they cast this with the right guy - I'm thinking Josh Brolin in Sicario - this would have been epic. I know there's only a set amount of great actors so I can't expect Gyllenhaal, Christian Bale, and Mcconaughy in every flick but I really had my hopes up for this one.",The Infiltrator
106,rbruce-29838,Cranston takes on Escobar and BCCI!!!!,8,17 July 2016,"Like another reviewer has said, this is more about how a US customs agent helps to bring down BCCI than taking out Escobar even though he is the main target. The film opens up with the main character(Cranston) involved in a smaller drug bust, in which he is wounded and is now up for early retirement. He decides to stay on for the biggest assignment of his career as he is tasked to somehow take down Escobar by going after the money men.(BCCI and co.) The movie is decently paced as you see how the undercover agent and his small crew befriend some Escobar bigwigs by offering to launder their money in the US by using legit US businesses as cover, using smaller amounts of $$$$$$$ to get under the feds radar. As Cranston's character gets deeper into the caper, the stakes get higher, and some folks die in the process. This isn't Scarface in terms of violence, as only 4 guys get capped throughout the film, so if you are going in for some really hot action you will be disappointed. I am glad that the film didn't go over the top with the violence though, as it really would not have fit the plot all that well. Still this is Pablo Escobar, so everyone is on edge as they know what will happen if their cover is blown. The acting is superb all around though. Cranston is doing his job, but as the danger mounts it is putting a strain on his family and his marriage, and this is really well portrayed. The people playing his crew are top notch as well. The novice agent that plays Cranston's wife for the scam is one gorgeous woman to boot!!!!!!! All in all I am glad to have seen this movie, as it was a portrayal of something that really went down in 1985, and was based on the book about the said incident. It was a great change of pace movie, to escape from all of the superhero and kid flicks that come out every summer. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes drama, with some suspense thrown in.",The Infiltrator

I was around in those days and even went to Cali, Colombia a few times in the 70's and 80's. Even many of the low level dealers were millionaires back in those days. So what really disappointed me was this guy was dealing with top members of the Medellin Cartel and the most they showed was one Rolls Royce, a hangar with a few nice planes, and one nice house. But these were people with hundreds of millions of dollars and many at the top were even BILLIONAIRES. Back in the 70's a billion dollars was maybe worth 50 billion today. Pablo Escobar had his own zoo with exotic animals all over the world, the Ochoa's bred beautiful stallion horses, and many of them had gorgeous mansions all over Miami and the U.S. but they didn't show none of that, which was very disappointing for me. Unlike many people who write reviews I'm no expert on movies but this seemed like a low budget film to me.

111,ahviraisk,"Breaking Not So Bad, Actually",7,1 August 2016,"In the era where summers are ruled by superheroes, sequels to blockbusters from last century, or uninspired remakes, The Infiltrator is nice adult entertainment where actors and story are carrying the films rather than CGI booms.Although The Infiltrator might be Brad Furman's best directorial job (that might not saying much) it is not very memorable film with lavish style (although it tries to emulate some 'Miami Vice' vibe with it's night shots of the city and very Jan Hammer like synthesizer score by Chris Hajian). It's pretty much textbook example how to make character driven film with straight forward story based on true facts. The story might even be too straight forward - not much excitement or thrills. The Infiltrator feels little bit like last years 'Black Mass' with Johnny Depp - exciting premise and perfect players, but still, that something special is missing to make it truly great film.If you care more about Oscar worthy acting jobs rather than Oscar worthy special effects, then The Infiltrator is summer movie for you.

113,u-76919-62790,Passable effort on a saturated topic,6,15 January 2017,"There are so many shows and films about Escobar, the people around him, the people that went against him, etc. I'm not sure why make another one. Obviously, this is about a real person, Mazur, but people watch this for ""bringing down Escobar"" not for ""Who was Robert Mazur.""A fictional film inspired by true events would've been much more interesting than a true story that is fictionalized/Hollywoodized. This film is the latter and it suffers for it.Not true enough to be a documentary nor interesting enough to be a movie. It's in the middle of nowhere.The problem with films like these is that the story is simplistic. We follow someone and see where he goes. Everyone else is a side-character. The best crime stories are ones that show both sides of it, the investigative/law enforcement side and the criminal side, give them equal time and equal attention, and then have them meet. For example, in TV land,Breaking Bad is good because it shows the DEA's investigation, the criminal world, the Mexican cartel, Gustavo, etc. and gives them all time. Shows that just show police work, a detective investigating criminals with nothing but clues and leads, is less interesting. Just as purely legal shows are less interesting, purely criminal ones and purely forensics.Obviously doing that would've needed more time, but it's possible. Single-sided stories are becoming more and more boring. Cardboard caricatures of bad guys are boring, just as perfect good-guys are boring. We want bad guys with motive, good guys that are flawed and reasons behind everything.Ultimately this film is ""Good guy Special agent vs bad guy drug dealers.""
