0,SnoopyStyle,functional escape flick,7,19 November 2020,"In 1978, Tim Jenkin (Daniel Radcliffe) and Stephen Lee (Daniel Webber) are two white members of the ANC setting off harmless pamphlet bombs. They get arrested and imprisoned with other white political prisoners. They are agitating to escape but longtime respected political prisoner Denis Goldberg (Ian Hart) counsels against it. French prisoner Leonard Fontaine (Mark Leonard Winter) is not like Goldberg.It needs more about their work and their struggle before prison. It also needs more after the escape. The prison and the escape is well done. It has a very good tick-tick of their escape plan. It has very good bones but the body around it is a little scrawny.",Escape from Pretoria
1,Prismark10,Escape from Pretoria,5,6 July 2021,"It's not much of a surprise that the end of Apartheid in South Africa by the mid 1990s. Signalled the end of the Apartheid era dramas such as Cry Freedom or A Dry White Season.It had firmly been established as a sub genre in itself by the 1980s.Post Apartheid era films such as such as Red Dust tackled life in the new South Africa and how it tackled its recent past with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Then there was the biography of Nelson Mandela in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.When it comes to the screen, the new South Africa is happy to stand in for any other country in its booming television and film industry. It has no time to inspect its past.Escape from Pretoria was actually shot in Australia.Based on a true story and set in the late 1970s. Tim Jenkin (Daniel Radcliffe) and Stephen Lee (Daniel Webber) are two anti Apartheid activists who are imprisoned for setting off pamphlet bombs.Heavily punished by the judiciary. Once in jail they immediately make plans to escape with a Frenchman. The prison housed Denis Goldberg (Ian Hart) a legendary political prisoner. As an ANC activist. He campaigned with Nelson Mandela and stood trial with him.The film is very much a prison escape movie as they make wooden keys and hatch an escape plan. No different to countless other movies such as Papillon or Escape from Alcatraz.The political subtext very much takes a backseat.",Escape from Pretoria
2,nogodnomasters,Prisoners of War,4,17 March 2020,"So we know they escape from the plot spoiler title. What we don't know is that it is the last scene in the film. This production is based on a true story of white people protesting Apartheid in 1973 South Africa. They would do things like blow up packets of leaflets, not exactly the right formula to hold my attention. They go to prison, carve wooden keys and escape. Not as thrilling when Stallone has to escape from a prison that would shame Houdini. You know the film where he is in ball and chains inside 3 consecutive titanium rooms with no doors and just a feeding tube located at the bottom of the ocean on Io, a planet that is freezing cold and no oxygen. The film took way to long.",Escape from Pretoria
3,kosmasp,Not Alcatraz,8,28 February 2021,"But as inescapable as the other (in)famous prison? I would say it does seem so. Then again, shouldn't Harry Potter be able to just use magic and ... ok don't even start with that. I would also say that Daniel Radcliffe has long outgrown his Harry Potter persona. You may feel different ... and maybe the beard is there to convince you otherwise (does not look like the person he is portraying when the comparison pics are put side to side at the end credits).Whatever the case, this is about men (women too of course, but this actually is mainly men) and their will to pursue freedom. You will get to see how and why they got put into prison in the first place and every other step of the way is quite clearly laid out. And because there is only the ""will they"" or ""won't they option"" I don't think you can claim you knew all along. So it is more the journey (no pun intended) and all the relationships that evolve that make this movie what it is ... a really good experience that is",Escape from Pretoria
4,Sleepin_Dragon,An excellent Jail break thriller.,8,21 March 2021,"I had my heart in my mouth for most of this film, based on true events it really did have me gripped, entertained, and on the edge of my seat for the moat part.It's a fascinating, and important story, and shows the horror of apartheid in the Country, the brutal regime, and abhorrent racism that was normal at the time. The story is as baffling today as it was back then, how on Earth did they manage to break our of there in the way they did.There sure were a lot of locks and keys!Daniel Radcliffe is excellent I have to say, he does a great job, as do the whole cast.Very good, 8/10.",Escape from Pretoria
5,classicsoncall,"""What we'd always accepted, we would now reject.""",7,15 September 2020,"At times harrowing and suspenseful, this is a classic prison break story in which the escapees must use their wits to determine the best, if not the only way to flee their incarceration. The story takes place in South Africa during the heyday of apartheid, at a time when activist white men joined forces with Nelson Mandela's ANC (African National Congress) in an attempt to break the racist white majority rule of the country. I thought the story could have been set up a little better than it was, being left dumbstruck as to how authorities knew it was Tim Jenkin (Daniel Radcliffe) and Stephen Lee (Daniel Webber) who set off the leaflet 'bombs' to open the picture. That could have been better explained since Jenkin and Lee looked like they dispersed into the crowd with no viable means of detection by the police. Be that as it may, once in South Africa's Praetoria state prison for white males, the pair of revolutionaries immediately begin plotting their escape, bringing a third member (Mark Leonard Winter) into their fold who was desperate to leave as well. Via exceptionally keen observation and skills with draftsmanship and woodwork, Jenkin managed to fashion a set of wooden keys that would open the locks of the prison doors. Even after seeing how they did it, I'm still not convinced that it could have been all that possible, but the proof is in the results as they say, so I can hardly question their success. Tense moments abound as the trio set out on their quest for freedom, and the film ends pretty much when they make their way to the city street just outside the prison walls. It would have been a bonus to see what might have happened to the prison guards who were held responsible for the lax in security, but the story didn't go there. I'd like to have been the fly on the wall for that one.",Escape from Pretoria

7,CinemaSerf,Wish I'd paid attention in woodwork class...,7,27 February 2021,"Dan Radcliffe actually manages to keep his clothes on for his quite decent performance as Tim Jenkin. He is a South African man imprisoned for twelve years in Pretoria after actively supporting the outlawed ANC. Once in jail, he and a few fellow inmates devise a singularly ingenious way of getting out. That's really the height of the plot, but the acting - accents notwithstanding - sustains it quite well, with Daniel Webber and an on form Mark Leonard Winter helping us appreciate just how cruelly the establishment was run, and how cleverly (and patiently) they implemented their escape plans. It's creatively shot, with effective use of audio effects, presenting us with an authentic looking depiction of their incarceration and though it does, definitely, plod at times, there are moments of genuine tension and suspense making for quite an engrossing film.",Escape from Pretoria
8,zardoz-13,The Great Escape!!!,10,20 April 2020,"Movies either with ""Escape"" in their titles or that depict an escape constitutes as a genre of their own. Whether war, western, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy and/or comedy, these movies share similar characteristics. Usually, we are inclined to sympathize with those yearning to escape, while we abhor the warden and his thuggish guards who torment these lost souls without mercy. Unfortunately, the title to British co-writer & director Francis Annan's ""Escape from Pretoria,"" reveals far too much about its outcome. Nevertheless, despite its title that tells all, this modestly-budgeted, but tense thriller about two real-life, white, South African, anti-apartheid activists who break out of a notorious prison for advocating the agenda of the African National Congress is riveting fare from fade-in to fade out. Naturally, our heroes escape, but not before freshman scenarist L.H. Adams and Annan turn the audience into a hopeless wreck. Examples of nerve-racking tension will have you climbing the walls long before this 107-minute, PG-13 escapade arrives at its inevitable conclusion. Annan orchestrates the action around the fewest number of sets possible to enhance the claustrophobia which makes for clenched fists and teeth gnashing. Naturally, the warden and his prison guards behave like ruffians, with no qualms about meting out brutal repercussions for the least infraction. Confined largely to the prison cell block, the mess hall, the workshop, and some exteriors inside and outside of the prison, ""Escape from Pretoria"" unfolds in close quarters, so the filmmakers can conceal their bare-bones budget. Largely, apart from the filmmakers' own anti-apartheid message, ""Escape from Pretoria"" confines itself to the incredible plot logistics of the escape rather than undercutting the suspense with garrulous political babble.South African authorities arrest Tim Jenkin (Daniel Radcliffe of ""Swiss Army Man"") and his friend Stephen Lee (Daniel Webber of ""Danger Close"") for setting off leaflet bombs in public. Basically, our heroes stack sacks of pamphlets touting the outlawed ANC party around trash piles along the sidewalks and time them to blow up. Keeping explosives to a minimum, and the pamphlets burst in the air after a loud pop and then flutter down onto bystanders. The police nab Jenkin and Lee on the spot. Tim draws a 12-year sentence at Pretoria Central Prison, while Stephen receives 8 years. Happily, Annan dispenses with the expository premise for this epic in about ten minutes. The rest of the film comprises our heroes' extraordinary plan to liberate themselves and another inmate, a mysterious Frenchman, Leonard Fontaine (Mark Leonard Winter of ""The Fear of Darkness""), from the slammer. Mind you, the guards display the pugnacity of pit bulls, and they regard the inmates with nothing less than contempt. Another anti-apartheid prisoner, Denis Goldberg (Ian Hart of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""), warns Jenkin about the sadistic sniper atop the prison walls. Goldberg opposes Jenkin's mad scheme. Instead, he counsels them to do their time as ""prisoners of conscience.""Madness accurately summarizes their outrageous escape plan. Utilizing the prison's carpentry workshop, Jenkin whittles wooden parts to create keys and then perfects them to open the locks. As preposterous as it sounds, this is how Jenkin and company escaped from the grim maximum-security prison! Jenkin fabricated 34 keys for the 15 doors! He made poles that could be threaded into longer lengths, with a lever mechanism which enabled him to reach through his prison cell windows and unlock the doors! Each cell in a unit featured a large window so the guards to eavesdrop on inmates during their rounds. At night, between the guards making their rounds, Jenkin and his collaborators patiently improvised with those keys. If one didn't work, Jenkin would tinker with it until he got it to work! Nevertheless, as audacious as all this sounds, Annan intersperses moments of white-knuckled agony when Jenkin loses a key with which he was experimenting outside of his cell window and must now recover it with chewing gum, before a guard ambles into the scene brandishing his nightstick. At one point, the warden ransacks Jenkin's cell because our hero slept through roll call. The warden suspects Jenkin hasn't been getting enough sleep. When he tosses Jenkin's cell, the warden hopes to find incriminating evidence. Cleverly, without calling attention to himself, Jenkin manages to hide the key facsimiles in plain sight without attracting curiosity. These meticulous inmates spent at least a year and a half perfecting these counterfeit keys. The most exciting moments of ""Escape from Pretoria"" occur when complications crop up. You'll cringe every time these incidents happen, and your heart will skip beats as our heroes struggle to elude discovery. To reveal anything more would dilute the many surprises which ensue.Annan and Adams relied on Tim Jenkin's 1987 autobiography, Inside Out: Escape from Pretoria Prison for the basis for their screenplay. Although the actual events transpired in South Africa, the film itself was produced on location in Australia. Annan and ""Dylan Dog: Dead of Night"" lenser Geoffrey Hall stage every scene of this prison drama with ingenuity as well as visual flair. Nick Fenton's spine-tingling editing aids and abets Adams and Annan at every twist and turn. Ironically, none of the entire cast or crew, apart from Jenkin's cameo as an inmate, were South African. Meantime, Annan has shrewdly suppressed superfluous political philosophizing and accentuated nail-biting thrills and pulsating chills. Daniel Radcliffe delivers a subdued performance as the shaggy-haired Jenkin. He spends most of his time sweating over getting the keys to fit the locks and suffering from all the anxiety involved in his efforts to escape. Ian Hart stands out of one of Jenkin's antagonists. Not surprisingly, characterization takes a back seat to the action. Indeed, the suspense and tension that ""Escape from Pretoria"" drums up is harrowing. ""Escape from Pretoria"" joins the ranks of some of the greatest escape movies ever made, such as ""The Great Escape,"" ""Papillon,"" ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang,"" ""The Midnight Express,"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption.""",Escape from Pretoria
9,deloudelouvain,That's what I call tension building at its best.,9,14 July 2020,"I'm really surprised by the relatively low ratings this movie gets on IMDb. I wonder what people expect nowadays from movies like this one? A movie based on a true story, but most of all an incredible story, very well written and directed by Francis Annan, clearly someone who knows how to build a tension with just minimalistic elements in the plot. I sat at the edge of my seat for some parts of this very enjoyable movie. The cast was also great, with a Daniel Radcliffe that proves again that he evolved from Harry Potter to an all round actor. He can play about anything and he did a great job again. To me Escape From Pretoria is definitely going to end in my top ten movies of this year. If you're a fan of escape movies then you surely won't be disappointed by this one. It belongs in the list of great prison escape movies, and it's based on true events what makes it always better. The negative critics on here have no clue about good movies, just ignore them and give this one a shot, you won't regret it.",Escape from Pretoria
10,MOscarbradley,A good old-fashioned and exciting prison break movie.,7,13 May 2020,"""Escape from Pretoria"" will never win any Oscars but this heartfelt, social-conscious thriller, based on a true story and set in a South Africa under Apartheid, is a lot better than I thought it was going to be. As the title tells us, it's an escape movie, (obviously), and by their very nature, escape movies usually make for good thrillers and this is no exception. It's very exciting while not afraid to show the horrors of the South African prison system at the same time.Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel Webber are the two young white members of the ANC imprisoned for distributing anti-government propoganda and Francis Annan's film is about how they escaped from Pretoria Prison. Ian Hart and Mark Leonard Winter are other prisoners in on the plan. It's a very compact little movie though it's unlikely to cause Bresson's ""A Man Escaped"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Papillion"" cause for concern. That said, this is still edge-of-the-seat stuff, very skillfully done, and the performances throughout are first-rate. In the end, you might just say, it does what it says on the tin.",Escape from Pretoria
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Hope shall set you free.,7,8 March 2021,"'Escape From Pretoria (2020)' is essentially an old-fashioned prison escape movie with a political dressing, being set in apartheid South Africa and focusing characters who fight for an anti-apartheid cause. It doesn't really have anything especially deep to say about its subject matter other than, well, racism is bad. Still, it's an interesting setting for a tried-and-true narrative, even if this one is based on real events and follows them relatively closely according to the actual man involved with the eponymous escape. It doesn't necessarily convey the hardships of prison life or create any compelling characters, aside from perhaps its three most major ones. What it does do, though, is provide a handful of genuinely suspenseful and exciting sequences. It presents its prison as a sort of multi-layered puzzle for its protagonists to unravel, with each successful solution usually being followed by another conundrum that requires even more intelligence to overcome. The format works better than you might think and it makes for an especially satisfying final movement. Ultimately, though it's relatively predictable and probably won't linger in your memory for too long, the flick is an enjoyable prison piece with solid performances and decent direction. 7/10",Escape from Pretoria

14,eddie_baggins,A prison escape movie with a difference,8,27 July 2020,"Based on the true story of a 1979 South African prison escape that three incarcerated men took part in during the heat of the apartheid battle that was raging in the country, this filmed in Australia thriller feels different to most daring escape movies as we are thrust into a sweat inducing plot that will have you on the edge of your seat for a majority of the films second half.Adapted from escapee and the mastermind behind the event Tim Jenkin's book, Escape from Pretoria marks an impressive debut feature film from British filmmaker Francis Annan, who in partnership with his fellow countryman and lead Daniel Radcliffe ensures that this low-budget affair enthralls through the most minor of instances as we watch and wait alongside Jenkins, Daniel Webber's Stephen Lee and Mark Leonard Winter's Leonard Fontaine as the trio plot their master-plan.Pretoria does away with any of the usual prison tropes where a battle with the warden or fellow inmates drives the plot, with the focus here remaining on the civil rights activist inmates and their plan dominating proceedings from almost the first moment we are thrown into the Pretoria prison.Radcliffe is as good as his been in a lead role, his South African accent and persona perfectly suited to Jenkin's nervy but brilliant mind, there are many instances where Annan and the one-time Boy Wizard draw stress inducing tension out of mere acts of wood carvings or in one instance chewing gum lead retrievals and its great too see the sometimes misused performer in such a well-suited role.If there was a major drawback in the character of Jenkins and the films characters as a whole its in the fact we don't get to fully comprehend what lead them down the path that saw them thrown into the notorious prison in the first place or what drives their friendship and connection with one another but that doesn't stop the film from achieving what it sets out to do in its creation of a constantly moving escape thriller.Come the films final stretch, there's little doubt remaining that the film has you completely hooked in the unique ploy of the men, who used shear mental prowess and carefully caressed planning to enact upon one of the era's most noteworthy acts of defiance, a powerful example of humankind's ability to keep pushing forward in even the most dire of circumstances.Final Say -A prison escape movie with a difference and true to life basing, Escape from Pretoria is a fantastically entertaining watch, that while not pushing any boundaries cinematically, ensures you as a watcher will be glued to your seat for the entirety of its runtime.4 wooden keys out of 5",Escape from Pretoria

22,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Escape from Pretoria,7,20 April 2020,"""You get twenty-four years if you're lucky, a bullet in your head if you're not"". Wow. Failing to break out of a bullish correctional facility with rooftop snipers is no joke man.Anyway, it was the ""dog days"" of summer in 1989. The film was Sly Stallone's Lock Up and it propelled me into the prison movie drama. Cut to thirty-one years later and I'm introduced to Escape from Pretoria (my latest review). ""Pretoria"" is a prison thriller that's the thinking's man prison thriller. Devoid of hardly any prisoner, warden, or prison guard brutality, Escape from Pretoria gets your heart pumping regardless. TV movie feel, bumbling security, feeble character development, and quick-knitted conclusion begot, it still gets my recommendation.Clocking in at just over 100 minutes and directed by Brit Francis Annan, ""Pretoria"" chronicles the prison break of two captives from a South African jail circa 1979. They were African National Congress supporters and they received sentences anywhere between 8 to 12 years. Daniel Radcliffe (as Tim Jenkin) and Daniel Webber (as Stephen Lee) play said captives and they give seething, disciplined performances. After being held for over four hundred days, their personas attempt to escape using wooden keys to unlock numerous, clanking doors (thankfully there were no closed-circuit television cameras back in '79).Reflecting on Escape from Pretoria, I was reminded of a less than compelling Shawshank Redemption, a placid version of Papillon, and/or a less foreboding model of Midnight Express. In verity, ""Pretoria"" is clean, true account film making that builds inching tension despite relegating hardly any real fear. Oh well. You know the outcome of the characters and go along with the flick's benign, PG-13 rating anyway. Thanks to some solid period detail and some masquerading Australian locales, there's movie ""escapism"" in these dark walls. Rating: 3 stars.",Escape from Pretoria

24,arungeorge13,"Great thrills, but character development is lacking! [+64%]",6,11 November 2021,"You can't deny the fact that Escape from Pretoria is a neat little jailbreak thriller, but it could have been so much more had more light been thrown on the film's lead characters. These guys have essential roles in apartheid history. The impact of their escape could have had a much greater payoff if writer-director Francis Annan had given us more character development. That's what makes good thrillers great: giving audiences reasons to care for the protagonists to succeed, even if they're doing something illegal. Escape from Pretoria is tremendous fun to watch, especially in its final 30 minutes, when the actual jailbreak is in progress.For a good portion of the first two acts, the makers focus solely on the aspect of trial & error key-making. Radcliffe (as Tim Jenkin) is the clear main-man here, with Webber (as Stephen Lee) playing more of a side-kick role. Mark Leonard Winter (as Leonard Fontaine) rounds off the lead trio, remarkably showcasing his desperation to escape.

This is that movie. Add that it is a true story and we are introduced to the age old cliche ""what one man can do, another can do"" and it it is demonstrated aptly. There are some tense scenes and what causes it to make you squirm, clench teeth, bite nails or hold breath is because of the two mainstays found in good filmmaking and human nature. 1. The people in the story risked heavy to be able to attempt the escape. Failure would triple and cripple them adding more hell to a already hellish environment. 2. Here is where you ask yourself: what would you have done? This movie demonstrates both points quite well and makes you wonder would you or wouldn't you more than once. Good stories with on point directing do this and of course these actors gave you all their real sweat. Adding it all up, you got a nice, entertaining movie on your hands and one more thing too. Take a moment to give these boys who did this some respect. They earned it and a place in the history of men who have learned and lived the following; if one doesn't take a risk there would be no gain thus no growth. To live or exist?

I really loved the antagonist characters like like the Prison Warden and the Guard. For me a good thriller and drama is only as good as how believable and dis-likable the antagonist can be. Both villains were very smart and formidable men you would not want to cross. The escapees were just smarter :)My only problem with this movie which prevented me from giving it higher than a 7 is the overweight dimwitted gross night watchman and the Mozart music over the loudspeakers. I would had preferred if they had used the guard that antagonized the prisoners and make it a battle of wits. A fat slob listening to Mozart and taking a dump in the bathroom just doesn't fit the story. Again, the more formidable the villains, the more tense and exciting the film would have been. I would have rewritten the nightwatchman to make him a tougher and smarter villain to outwit.Good acting performances by all. Good watch.",Escape from Pretoria

My Score. 8/10Of course this Feature Movie would be better viewed as intended on a Cinema screen but in the time of COVID I found it and rented it on a streaming channel.
It's a very impressive suspenseful movie based on the real-life prison break of three political captives, Escape From Pretoria is a race-against-time thriller set in the tumultuous apartheid days of South Africa in December 1979.
Daniel Radcliffe stars as Tim Jenkin, who took part in the escape and whose book ""Inside Out: Escape from Pretoria Prison"" inspired the film. Tim Jenkins has a cameo in the film as a prisoner. The film was shot during the 40th anniversary year of the actual escape.Daniel Radcliffe's as Tim Jenkin narrates and we watch as he and Stephen Lee (Daniel Webber) are arrested after illegally planting a leaflet bomb that distributes pro-ANC (African National Congress) protest material in Cape Town back in 1978. Tim is quickly sentenced to 12 years in Pretoria and Stephen eight, and the rest of the narrative is almost completely set in the confines of the Prison.
Daniel Webber stars as Jenkins friend and anti apartheid activist Stephen Lee and the third escapee is Australian actor Mark Leonard Winter as Leonard Fontaine the third partner in the escape and his character is fictional for some reason?
The actual character Egyptian-born activist Alexandre Moumbaris is a political activist and former political prisoner. He was born in Egypt to Greek parents, grew up in Australia, lived and worked in the UK, was imprisoned in South Africa and now lives in France.Daniel Radcliffe and fellow actor Ian Hart who is excellent cast as Denis Goldberg ,a Political prisoner previously worked together in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001), where Radcliffe played Harry Potter and Hart played Professor Quirrel.
Daniel Ratcliffe again shows his versatility and talent in a very challenging dramatic role as the mastermind behind the escape and has some very intense scenes .
No spoilers from me I guess the title ""Escape From Pretoria ""says it all but the journey to get to the prisoners Goal and destination is well worth the movie rental.
Filmed in Adelaide, Escape From Pretoria is an official Australian/UK co-production between Hamilton Entertainment (Hotel Mumbai), BeaglePug (Harry Potter franchise) and Footprint Films (I Am Sami), in association with Arclight Films and with support from the South Australian Film Corporation. It is the first feature length film of Director Francis Annan, an award-winning short filmmaker with an extensive 16-year-career at BBC, which included directing primetime BBC One drama.
The prison used for filming in the movie is Redruth Gaol is a historic former prison situated in Burra in South Australia. Later known as the Redruth Reformatory, it now operates as a country museum.The quality of the Production is equal to Hotel Mumbai and special mention must be made to David Hirschfelder for another excellent film score.
He has composed for movies like Elizabeth, The Dressmaker, Shine, Australia, and his music for Escape From Pretoria is up there with his best film scores.
The Supporting cast of Nathan Page as Mongo and Grant Piro as Captain Schnepel

33,maccas-56367,Great true prison break movie,9,7 August 2020,"Escape from Pretoria holds its tension and suspense throughout, and kept me on the edge of my seat!The real-life background to this added an extra layer of interest. Incredible true story. I think they did it justice, even if some people may question the South African accents.Daniel Radcliffe puts in a great performance as anti-Apartheid activist Tim Jenkin. I have thoroughly enjoyed his work outside of the Harry Potter series. Daniel Webber also delivers as Stephen Lee, making us Aussies proud - exciting to see where his career is going after previously loving his Vince Neil role in The Dirt.There is definitely a strong Australian presence in this film. It's unmistakably Australian in its location, despite being set in South Africa. I thought this worked well though, and it was an element I liked.Escape from Pretoria certainly features an abundance of keys turning in locks. Despite this, it never got boring - such was the effective way the filmmakers built suspense. It's definitely one of those films that gets you researching the true life story afterwards.Highly recommend - especially for fans of Radcliffe and prison movies.",Escape from Pretoria
34,rdoubleoc,It's good.,8,8 April 2020,"It's slow moving at first, but ends up delivering in the 2nd half of the movies.",Escape from Pretoria
35,trinaboice,Jailbreak flick made better than expected with tension and a true story,9,15 March 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
I've always been fascinated by prison stories, especially if they're true ones. This thriller takes us to South Africa where we get to watch the true events unfold with two political captives placed in jail during the dangerous apartheid days of 1979. Writer and director Francis Annan creates an old-school jail break that will keep you riveted. It's a story that needs to be told, especially as things are heating up in South Africa AGAIN.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
A man gets beaten with a stick. Another man punches another man. Otherwise, there is a surprising lack of violence considering the movie takes place inside a prison.
There is quick mention of Mandela. Kids may not be familiar with Nelson Mandela's story, nor the history of apartheid in South Africa.
Some profanity.THINGS I LIKED:
Daniel Radcliffe has been very busy lately! His film Guns Akimbo was just barely released and now this film has hit theaters too. I know a lot of people will never be able to see him as anything other than the child actor in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but his performance in this movie was excellent. He does a great job showing his acting range in the variety of roles he has been choosing in films recently. Good for him.
Daniel Webber plays a supporting role, along with Mark Leonard Winter, although Daniel Radcliffe truly carries the film.
There is a lot of tension from the very beginning until the very end.
Some real film footage and photos from the 1970s give you a sense of the history. At the end of the movie, you get to see photos of some of the real men.
Some people are calling this an Australian film simply because it was filmed in Australia. The story takes place in South Africa, mostly inside the walls of a prison, so it doesn't matter to me where it was filmed. Apparently, the filmmakers wanted to film in South Africa, but due to financial issues, they had to either film in Australia or not make the film. I'm glad they chose Australia so they could share this story with all of us.
The sound effects were so good that whenever a door squeaked or a key creaked, you feared for the lives of the protagonists.
The creative camera angles kept things interesting. Just like in the recent movie The Invisible Man, there are a lot of moments that are crafted with long camera scans that build tension and suspense so effectively. Two great thrillers in theaters at the same time. Sweet.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
You don't get enough backstory to truly understand what the protagonists were up to right before they got arrested. We assume they're good people trying to make a point about equality, but we don't really get enough information. All we see is that they distributed some political leaflets. That was their big crime? Surely, there was more to it than that, but they're swooped off to jail and we know we're missing something.
The movie focuses on the plan to break out of jail, not on character development. We just don't get to learn much about the people we're rooting for. I wanted to learn more about who the men were and spend less time watching keys being made.
Some Americans might have a tough time understanding everything said because of the South African accents.
I've always thought it odd that jails allow prisoners to work on tasks with tools, knowing they could make weapons and other items with those same tools.
I'm completely biased, but the best jailbreak movie ever made is The Shawshank Redemption.
Threatening fellow prisoners and truly awful security guards could have built up even more tension.
Many of the scenes at night are so dark that it will make viewing on small devices difficult once the movie goes to streaming.
It's a bit of a slow burn told in chronological order. Because of that, the movie actually feels longer than it is.You can watch my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Escape from Pretoria
36,mjsreg,Tedious,5,4 April 2020,"I really don't know how I managed to get through this movie.It is tedious with a fantasised story based on real events - but not actually the event as it was at the time.Overall, I wouldn't waste my time watching this again.",Escape from Pretoria
37,danielcereto,Escape from boredom,4,1 May 2020,"I love series like Prison Break or El Marginal, so that's why I tried to watch this one called Escape from Pretoria. This movie is pretty far to be as good as other reviewers said.
First, this is the cleanest and safest prision I've ever watched in my entire life. Not credible. Prisons are dirty, and dangerous not like Disneyworld.
Second, nothing happens here. Slow paced and standard acting. Also, all the inmates are really polite and well educated. Again, not credible.
Last, I think this movie could have been far better introducing more drama. Looks like made for family watching on a Sunday afternoon.
So, not recommended if you love movies like Prisoners, Celda 211 or series like Prison Break or El Marginal.",Escape from Pretoria
38,JoelChamp85,Heart Racer,8,23 April 2021,"I love escape films, it shows how human beings are the smartest creatures in the world, able to solve complex puzzles that are meant to be unsolvable.

39,PyroSikTh,Suspenseful yet Forgettable,7,11 June 2021,"I certainly enjoyed my time with this movie. I was on the edge of my seat, right in there with them, enthralled with the simple idea of just building keys to unlock the doors. It's so simple I can't believe it wasn't a more common tactic to escape prisons. It resulted in multiple scenes that absolutely seeped in suspense, leaving you waiting for something to go wrong, or for their problems to blow up in their faces and get them caught. I felt it could've done more with the subject material, and Radcliffe's performance was a little all over the place, but ultimately none of this detracted too much from the movie's ultimate goal of being an entertaining prison escape film. Unfortunately because of that though, it's unlikely to leave much of a lasting impression. I give Escape From Pretoria an enjoyable enough 7/10, but it's certainly not going to blow you away.",Escape from Pretoria

42,akcenat,Decent but unspectacular prison break B-movie,6,22 June 2020,"""Escape from Pretoria"" (2020) is simple thriller based on a book of the same title that was published in South Africa 1987. As a movie (with actors who BTW have terrible Afrikaans accents) it's too much focus on boring routine how to escape from a South African prison during apartheid time. It also have a lot of still shots and close ups typical for TV/B movies with visible modest budget too. Like with any film that is ""based on a true story"" certain liberties are taken with the true to life events. Here, the real third partner in the escape has been fictionalized as Frenchman Leonard. But, comparing to the real event or real third person here he has no discernible history or proper motivation, while two real black helpers are marginal presented (at best). That is why this movie - as a re-enacted chapter of anti-apartheid history - may not feel entirely authentic, not to mention that movie was filmed in Australia not South Africa. As it is, it's been done cheaply but it's O.K. as a (106 min) rental during Corona pandemic.Rating: 6- out of 10 (easily forgettable soon after the viewing)",Escape from Pretoria
43,TwistedContent,Well Executed Old-School Jailbreak Thriller,7,7 March 2020,"Not two weeks after ""Guns Akimbo"" Daniel Radcliffe rewards us with yet another great performance, this time in a tightly made, old-school B-like jailbreak thriller set against a historically true background. Francis Annan's ""Escape from Pretoria"", while flawed in some areas, gives legitimate thrills and keeps you excited all throughout, as you follow the trio of men on the quest of freedom.""Escape from Pretoria"" is based on the prison escape of two political captives from Pretoria Central Prison in South Africa in 1979. The movie starts with an introduction of the political events taking place in South Africa during that time, more precisely the Apartheid. Soon after Tim Jenkin (Daniel Radcliffe) and Stephen Lee (Daniel Webber) get arrested and sent to prison for 8 or more years, there they meet politically related Denis Goldberg (Ian Hart) and their third accomplice Leonard Fontaine (Mark Leonard Winter). Most of the time we spent inside the prison, following the routine and efforts of our three main heroes - the story focuses a lot on creating suspense and in doing so has it has created many good and very enjoyable sequences. It's all about the thrill of finding the means to reach freedom. ""Escape from Pretoria"" is a neat and successful exercise in a familiar formula, utilized since way back when, Clint Eastwood's ""Escape from Alcatraz"" has the same qualities. Includes also great attention to detail. The pacing's nice and even, with some great pick-ups here and there. With the focus being on atmosphere, excitement and genre mechanics, the script is lacking in the area of depth, more precisely the characters, there's not a lot of set-up or backstory for them. However, the performances make up for that. Visually, the movie excels as well, using various cool camera tricks and touching up the suspense with technical means, the cinematic language is on point all throughout.""Escape from Pretoria"" is a great procedural thriller, a successful execution of genre mechanics, a carefully planned movie about planning. If it lacks depth, it definitely possesses a good entertainment value, further fulfilled with great acting work. Good prison-set movies don't come out all that often. My rating: 7/10.",Escape from Pretoria

45,zeekwunlau,It's actually a jailbreak biography,7,25 March 2020,"After watching the whole film, I feel that the theme is simple and the ingredients are simple. Maybe the plot is designed this way because of the truth.
The whole process was disturbed, and when they saw that they had escaped from the taxi successfully, they felt worried for them, lest they be arrested again. Since then, he has escaped for many years, and jailbreak success is just the beginning.
As long as you insist on your beliefs in your heart, whether it is advocating for freedom or being a victim (honestly suffering from prison), it has its own consistency. On the contrary, the most terrible thing is that because there is no freedom for a while, you do not yearn for freedom and change your beliefs.

It fully exploits the strength of film making with beautiful camera work showing how the escape was planned and executed very much in the style of the Great Escape which is still one of the most popular movies of its genre.
The difference here is that it is recent history, and Daniel Radcliffe's powerful performance and his absolute belief that he and his two friends will escape give the film its power and authority.
There are some dodgy accents which sound more Australian than South African at times but the film sweeps you along and you feel very sorry for those prisoners who were invited to escape with the main gang.

***Dan Radcliffe talking:
""The film was made in Adelaide in Australia, and Mark(the producer) admits that it is gutting that they weren't able to make it in South Africa.""It's a real heart-breaker. The intention between 2003 and 2018 was always to film it in South Africa. But we couldn't get it together financially.""We had the decision to make where we could go somewhere else where we could tell the story and where we would hope South Africa would forgive us or we hung on for a year to see if we could sort the money to make it in South Africa and then that might be another year and then another year and it might never get made.

anti aparhied activists during the 70. Daniel Radcliff heads up the cast acting as Tim Jenkin. While Mark Leonard Winter and Daniel Webber act as fellow escapies. The story follows the story from the cause of incarceration through to the escape. (Saying they escaped isn't a spoiler seeing as its a true story). As interesting as the story is and may have made for a good documentary. I just don't feel it made that good of a film. The characters lacked charisma or much intrigue and the plot was rather predictable with a few moments of tension added to make things more interesting. True stories can sometimes make for amazing films but sometimes they make for better documentaries. I would have rather seen this as a documentary. The movie is by no means bad. The acting was good. The story made sense. The sets were good. The music was ok. So overall 7/10. Not a bad film but definitively not in my top 100 film list.",Escape from Pretoria

It's a straight-up prisonbreak movie that takes plays during the Apartheid period in South Africa, but this is not the leading story.

Radcliff's performance was the highlight for me - even though he didn't really becomes a person, he's just that intense intelligent guy I guess.
The story however is just a little too flat to make an impact. It lacks in character immersion, the storyline doesn't have any details that make you go oeh or ah. It's really just a very straightforward flick.Yes, there is some tension, but It all comes from the same thing, the sense of getting caught. Which is a valid and important one in a prison break movie, but there are no extra layers. Actually, because of the only tension being about things that go wrong while time is running out because the guard comes, It all felt a bit stale at the end, when they actually did make their final run. It even annoyed me a little.There are so many other jail break movies, and even series, that managed to bring more. And especially with the premise of the actual story, I felt they could have added a bit more flavour. More than just a prison break. Add a bit more politics, apartheid backdrop and character development.It's not fair to compare It to Shawshank maybe, but that movie was even more about the people than the prison break.

The movie is a real life story based on the escape of three political prisoners in South Africa in 1979.The Good - The thriller keeps you on the edge of the seat till the end. I could sense some Escape From Alcatraz vibes in the movie. It is a must watch drama from 2020 that deserves recognition and appreciation for the hardwork the actors put in.The Bad - The movie has a slow pace in the beginning however it tends to pick up and keeps you in suspense till the end.I would suggest you watch this movie due to it highlighting a political message and also the effort these actors put in. I had no clue about the history that went down in South Africa and this movie really illuminates the issue from an aspect of a political prisoner.",Escape from Pretoria

82,mark-53494,Outstanding,10,7 March 2020,I decided to watch this after reading a little bit of the story and what a truly great outstanding film with a brilliant cast to match the story and the conditions of the prison and to be based on a true story how they managed to escape and having to make different keys I would never think it would even work but it proved me wrong and all the risks what they done without getting caught that's why I rated it 10/10.,Escape from Pretoria
83,aboodakram-48692,"A ""The Shawshank Redemption"" wannabe that absolutely delivers, but with a lot of wasted potential.",7,3 April 2020,"Starting things off with the plot, It was well-balanced and understandable enough when you consider the type of the movie. However, it lacks the dramatic side of the story and in some points throughout the movie, it starts to feel predictable, not to mention that sometimes the mission itself feels so much easy and not challenging rather than the opposite, as it should.Acting wise, the movie gives some great roles with this category, especially when you consider Radcliffe's and Mark Leonard Winter's performances. However, Daniel Webber's one, it just feels pointless sometimes, not to mention that the movie in general didn't give much time for the actors to express themselves, especially Daniel Radcliffe who shows a lot of potential, but unfortunately get wasted.Theme wise, the movie is also well-balanced and well-decorated, and hits on a powerful subject that everybody cares about. In addition to the fact that this picture is one of the best thriller movies made so far in the last 5 years or so.The directing is decent, but as I mention, the time didn't give a chance for the director to express himself as well.Last but not least, the movie is decent enough when consider the cinematography, the editing and of course the thrilling music used in some scenes that will be historical in the future, in addition to the scenes where music is not used, those are the perfect ones.In general, the movie is not that unique, but definitely re-watchable due to the positive aspects I mentioned.",Escape from Pretoria

Can't believe this movie is slept on. I mean if anyone pays me to watch Avengers c*** I wouldn't watch it, yet movies like this gets blase rating. Wow.It is suspenseful and riveting.

The tension builds and builds as the plot to break out develops and the anxiety of the final scenes is unbearable ...I did not know the actual story and I will not reveal it here ... but the ending blew me away and I did not see it coming.

The film has nothing more to offer, except for Daniel Radcliffe, who takes great pains to give the film something special by portraying physical fear. I was annoyed to have spent money on it. Just the fact that people's hairstyles don't even change during a long prison stay is ridiculous. From the beginning to the end, the actors look the same. There is no atmosphere created in the film at all that being locked up is something terrible. This is a below average film that only convinces with beautiful visuals and good editing. Waste of time.",Escape from Pretoria

What follows is obviously them trying to find a way of getting out although I feel one of two main protagonists is more of a sidekick. There are exciting moments wich make it a fine movie but the background story lacks. I never found out why this equality battle is so important for them which makes it somewhat random. My guess is the viewer is expected to already believe apartheid is abnormal but back in the day it WAS normal in South Africa. Good fun, but no classic.",Escape from Pretoria

99,TheMovieBro,"Works for what it is, if it was that.",5,16 January 2021,"This movie is confused, or the financiers and the filmmakers had a lot of disagreements. For brief moments, mostly the first and last 5 minutes, it pretends to be a political drama film about apartheid, when the bulk of the evidence points to it just being a thriller prison escape movie. I get that it CAN be both, and it's accurately based on a true story that is about a prison escape during apartheid, but this is definitely not both. Anything to do with the setting or the premise just seemed kind of thrown in, not actually relevant to most of the story being told. Like some kind of schmuck-bait cherry on top of a basic prison escape movie. I learned more about woodworking than I did apartheid, and the accents are obnoxiously atrocious. I don't know, pick a lane, or commit to the whole story, but don't try to convince me that Harry Potter is a South African civil rights leader in the opening scene and then spend the next 90 minutes just being a bunch of white guys trying to escape prison.",Escape from Pretoria

Development of the idea of escape from prison is very thoughtfully shown. In addition, the authors do not forget to convey the whole atmosphere of South Africa at that time.Again, the tension in the film lasts from start to finish. I really worried about the heroes, they were living characters. Dramaturgy works in the film.The game of heroes is also on the level.It's a very worthy game from Radcliffe, an undoubted talent.

The movie is very entertaining and at some Points very tense . But at the end when they eventually escape , it felt like it all happened a little to easy .

Escape from Pretoria movie is such a well made film. Though we have seen many prison escape films in the past there was an instant connect with the main characters from the start. Daniel Radcliffe was really believable in his character and he delivered an awesome performance. Both the other actors along with him did their part so well. The important aspect about the movie had to be the whole escape planning process which kept me on the edge. Guards are shown as some scary monster kind people which added the scare element to another extend.
Towards the ending I felt the same emotion as those of the characters which is the best thing a movie can offer.

109,pking-49457,They Finally Get Out,6,6 February 2021,"I like Daniel Redcliffe, his films have good subject matter and he generally puts in a good performance. No different this time.
The film starts well and builds into a steady momentum, enough going on to keep the connection with the characters. However 3/4 into the movie some of the action is overdone, too much fingernail biting turns into annoyance and some dialogue and scenes seem to place the tension on hold, with attempting to expand the plot.
Simplicity would have been the Key to keep the connection with the characters. The story on it's own is enough, yeh, a bit of unnecessary scenes trying reinforce the nuance when from the onset it was successfully applied. There are few bits that come close to being out of sync with the general flow and is slighty rushed as they escape, while unnecessary intreractions are used in an attempt to slow it down. As result there is no great relief at their freedom.",Escape from Pretoria

I'm not a Daniel Radcliffe fan, I cannot stand "" Harry Potter "", however I really enjoyed his performance in this movie. Very tense at times, the 100 minutes or so run time of this movie passed quickly and my wife and I were very entertained. Reviews of this movie complaining of being an Australian movie are unjustified. This is very much a South African story that just happened to be filmed in Australia. It's a PRISON movie, it could have been filmed on the moon, who cares where it was filmed?. Daniel Webber was also a great co star and I think he is improving in each performance he gives.

I actually enjoy Daniel Radcliffe's films since Harry Potter. I haven't seen all of them, but I've seen enough to know that he's doing his best to prove an actor can move away from a role as huge as Harry Potter, and have a very decent career afterwards. Most of the time the storyline in his films is interesting and there's usually a deeper message and meaning too, which is nice to see in the ocean of utter rubbish produced these days.",Escape from Pretoria

Today in 2020 the ANC continue murdering their own people and white people and yet this film tries to look back in time as if they were heroes to try and justify the terrible government and system in place today.

The story also largely reflects what is said to have actually happened. Radcliff consulted the real life Jenkins. I was shocked to realise that Apartheid only ended in the 1990s.

The director used the same frames as the documentary and Even used the same CGI.

You get to concentrate on the core of the film, which as the film title eludes to, is escape.I never heard of the characters or the escape and how they did it which was refreshing and enjoyed learning this in the film. It's simple, and before I knew it, the film ended. I have never been in prison, South Africa or a guard, so I can't comment on the authenticity of these aspects though I question the number of night guards. I didn't think much of the accents as they seemed odd, particularly the court scene.

In my opinion his only and greatest achievement is managing to grow up surrounded by some of the very best actors the world has to offer in the HP films and not managing to pick up any talent for himself. He is quite proud of the fact he never went to drama school, well I wouldn't be.Why am I going on about him?

Tim and Leo (mark and dan) were the only two actors I was impressed with. The background was nonexistent if you didn't know about the moment before you probably still won't after. Recurring scenes from lazy writing. It felt at times scenes were cut down or non existent. The build up was more intense than the escape itself. But in a way that is a accurate presentation of life. You put the work in for little pay off. Kind of how the production team must be feeling. Its entertaining enough but definitely doesn't leave me gripped to my seat. Had the actors and landscapes been South African I would have rated higher,Escape from Pretoria
148,elwardani-60125,Good story but i have my take on overacting,4,3 June 2021,Danielle Radicliffe annoying breathing sound made the movie unwatchable.,Escape from Pretoria
149,wryderdavies,Prison break,5,26 February 2021,"Not the most exciting of prison break films. Not a lot of light and an interestingly tense build up which largely fizzled out. What would have really made it would have been less of the slow dialogue in the prison, and more about what happened next: there was a huge man hunt across southern Africa which they not only evaded, but they eventually made their way to the UK. This would have been a more befitting end to this important piece of documented history.",Escape from Pretoria
150,engin_ozdemir1,So much potential is wasted on this one.,5,10 October 2020,"Thought crime and the keys are the main things that keep Escape from Pretoria from being a classic prison movie! In fact, the keys are very important here, the vein of the film about freedom and idealism flows here. The film quickly captures the incident that caused Tim Jenkin and Stephen Lee to enter from the outside and says the real story is inside. In the atmosphere of the 1970s when racism was widespread and the rights of black people to life were disregarded, Jenkin and Lee continue their activist identity in prison. We see the two very short outside. They are building a leaflet dispenser (bird bird), caught and put inside! Jenkin's engineer head and passion for freedom are constantly looking for ways to escape from prison! Returning to the world of prisoners; When Tim and Stephen open up their escape ideas to the prisoners around them, they are obviously not enthusiastic. Because the wish of the first prisoner is to escape from there. But this can involve long and deterrent routes. Alex Moumbaris is the only one who believes in these two minds and is united with them. Because he is aware of a life that has escaped from outside. It is also noteworthy that the prisoners do not tell each other while watching the movie. There is almost no clash between prisoners. There are only differences of opinion. That is why our trio is taking firm steps on their way, everything is quite easy except for a few minor snags. I couldn't help saying that maybe this is the movie's hoax!",Escape from Pretoria
151,SmudgeSmill,"Spoiler alert: they escape. Is that a spoiler, or just the movie's title.",6,22 May 2020,"I spent the first 15 minutes cringing at the accents and wondering why they chose to use Australian and British actors filmed in Australia to portray a South African story.
Once I got over that, I was able to tolerate the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, the moments of tension were never tense because the title has already given away the fact that the escape was successful.
As such, I found this movie watchable, but barely more than that. If you have a spare 106 minutes and you've already watched all the good movies, you could do worse than this.Curiously, the escape itself was only part of the story. I would've liked to see less about the keys and more about how the escapees were communicating with the outside world, then how they covertly travelled from South Africa through Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania before making it to England.",Escape from Pretoria

However, in terms of tension it doesn't compare to Midnight Express or Shawshank Redemption. For me the reason is obvious, their time in prison doesn't seem that harsh.

171,Audix_Dude,Typical Hollywood nonsense,1,20 September 2020,"Firstly, any South African will cringe at the terrible South African accents. They are on par with Dick van Dyk's ""Cockney"" accent in Mary Poppins. That the producers did not get any number of brilliant South African actors to play the smaller parts, kike that of the Magistrate for example's sake, beggars belief. One can understand that A list actors from other countries are needed for the main roles, and Daniel Radcliffe's accent was reasonable, but to wreck the entire film by stuffing it with people who absolutely butcher the accent is ridiculous.The lack of any real South African accent literally spoiled everything although people not familiar with a proper South African accent would probably not be put off by that.Then there is the deliberate Holywood political overkill of dressing the prison guards in black to look like the Nazi Gestapo.

225,royrlaw,White people fought apartheid too,5,28 March 2021,"Spoilers alert.Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe lends his talent to this movie about white south Africans caught up in the struggle against apartheid, the very system.that favours their race. They are looked upon as ""verraiers"" or betrayers of their own race by the authorities. However let me be the first to point out that had they been Black they would have found it much harder to eventually escape from the maximum security prudon. Those years whites and blacks were kept in separate sections of Pretoria prison and treated quite differently.This film provides little insight of the daily running of the prison, instead focuses on the breakout which took about a year or so to accomplish. There were no security cameras around to watch as the two heroes plot , plan and experiment opening and closing cell doors. The film deviates from the book at times for dramatic effect. The ending, which we all should know as it's basically in the title, is a bit of an anti climax. They just walk out unnoticed and mingle with other people in the street. First stop is at a black taxi rank where they are allowed to use the servicalthough this is against the law.

226,rebeccaok-25142,Good Watch and Great Performance,9,4 May 2021,I don't understand the low score this film got. It was thrilling and kept me in suspense the whole time and Daniel Radcliffe gave an excellent performance. Not life changing or anything but definitely a good film that I would recommend.,Escape from Pretoria
227,janunsworth,Dreadful accents,3,7 August 2021,Having spent so much time on SA over the years and a longstanding South African partner I found this movie totally unrealistic. I believe in the facts but the acting was dreadful. Is a SA accent a mix of cockney and Australian... I think not!Had to switch off after 30 minutes.,Escape from Pretoria
228,rafael_chapman,"Good movie, TERRIBLE accents",7,23 August 2021,"I almost turned it off at the outset because the accents were so so bad. And I say this as an expat. Even the way they say ""howzit"" was way off. Man, that aspect was appalling - unforgivable - almost...
But I felt the movie ultimately redeemed itself and the tension had me glued to my seat. It reminded me of a great escape movie from years past.Next time - use some South African actors!!",Escape from Pretoria
229,michrobertson08,Bad accents,8,1 March 2021,As a South African I was sad to hear just how bad the accents were. Good movie but would have been so much better with South African actors,Escape from Pretoria
230,twookey,The issue here is that the politics is misplaced,3,28 February 2021,"When creating tension one has to be in support of the subject, or cause of the protagonists. If one isn't on their side then the tension is greatly diminished.The quality of the film is therefore irrelevant. Two bombers from a terrorist organisation are trying to escape and there is no tension, since you don't want them to succeed.",Escape from Pretoria
231,Tropicc,So tense,8,28 June 2020,Has been a while since I saw a movie so tense! There are some annoying moments like drawing attention to themselves all the time (constantly looking back and nervous behaviour) but besides that a very enjoyable film.,Escape from Pretoria
232,downingpatrick,Tension through simplicity,8,6 March 2020,Had I seen the IMDB rating I might not have watched it but am pleased I did. This production kept me engaged throughout bringing dramatic tension even to bubblegum on the ens of a stick! Particularly if you knew the consequences awaiting the protagonists if they failed. Perhaps the appalling situation could have been more graphically set up but as a prison break movie it works well but not if you want the graphic violence that so many filmmakers resort to for tension. Ignore the negatives & watch it,Escape from Pretoria
233,mattyh08,A MUST-SEE,10,24 March 2021,"Not sure who is marking it so badly but they're wrong. I marked it 10 out of 10 to try and bring the average rating up. Would've given it a solid 8 out of 10 ordinarily. It's hugely enjoyable to watch, but when you realise it's based on a true story it makes even more tense to watch!",Escape from Pretoria
234,kimtjun,Movie about key and his breath from nose,2,8 March 2020,"90% Voice from hobbit nose
And this movienis about nothing but key",Escape from Pretoria
235,sureshkumar-mail,Intense and strong acting,9,9 April 2020,"Without high hopes, I started watching this movie. Wow, what a surprise!!! i was overwhelmed with the intense screenplay and a great acting by Daniel. I just couldn't take off my eyes from the movie. Everyone should watch this atleast once and you'll feel the tension.",Escape from Pretoria
236,natedamico,"""We have a famous actor!"" What a failure.",1,30 October 2021,"The sole marketing tool for this movie is Daniel Radcliffe. And it's a tragedy: the movie would be compelling without him. White anti-apartheid freedom fighters imprisoned for believing in freedom? What a tale. It should be impressive. Instead we're given a lackluster British prince (what other title can be given to a man catapulted to international fame at 12) in a movie about another continent. The hero of a movie about the struggle for South African independence and racial equality has a British accent? Copied and pasted from an early 2000s magical fiction? Wow. The tale of South Africa's freedom has both heroes and villains, but they are all South African, not British posh boys famous since adolescence. The tool this movie uses for acknowledgement is in fact it's downfall.",Escape from Pretoria
237,njshort73,Hold your breath for this ride.,8,27 May 2020,"I would have liked the story to continue more to show what they were fighting for rather than just focused on the escape and would have liked to hear a bit more about the other prisoners and why they were in there and to have explored their stories too. Overall, I really enjoyed holding my breath throughout this intense film and a solid performance by all actors.",Escape from Pretoria
238,rbett9,Makes terrorism acceptable,1,12 March 2021,"Disturbing that such a film can be made. Awful acting, historically false and a dull story. Worst of all, the moral is that terrorism and the murder of innocent people is fine if you are a Marxist.",Escape from Pretoria
239,zied_tom,Very good movie with exceptional moments,9,16 March 2021,"It's a great actually .. recommended for those who love intelligence ,suspense and emotions all in one.",Escape from Pretoria
240,wyliej-91830,Suspence through out was amazing. Gripping,8,21 March 2020,"As South Africans thought the film was very good. Don't know if anything can be done to the accents, especially in the court scene. Was kept fixed to my seat and didn't know what to expect. Did enjoy very much",Escape from Pretoria
241,morganka-80834,So many more great South African stories..,6,31 March 2020,"Not a bad representation of how things where in South Africa in the 70's , 80's and into the 90's.Daniel Radcliff played a good role Although I think they could of rather used a South African for the Lead. Not a bad way to spend a evening watching you won't feel like you've wasted 2 to 3 hours of your life.",Escape from Pretoria
242,craigmitchell-43539,Always enjoy a true story about a prison break,6,24 March 2021,Probably some of the worst South African accents....especially the judge. Should have filmed it in South Africa with a few local actors.,Escape from Pretoria
243,lebonajunius-43968,"""amper maar nie stamper""",6,7 March 2020,"I really preferred National Geographic's ""Breakout"", episode ""Freedom Fighter Escape"" over this. As a South African myself, i agree with other reviews on accents of actors. The natgeo's documentary had far much better acting & edge of the seat moments than the movie.",Escape from Pretoria
