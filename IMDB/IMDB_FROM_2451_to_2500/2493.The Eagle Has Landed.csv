0,MartinHafer,difficult to believe but great entertainment,8,23 June 2006,"This is an exceptional war movie about a supposed plot by the Nazis to kidnap Churchill. Michael Caine is a German officer who speaks perfect English and leads a team of paratroopers who are disguised as Poles. The cover story is that they are a Free Polish regiment on maneuvers in Britain. At the same time, IRA leader Donald Sutherland helps lay the groundwork for their arrival.The story is very complex and the acting is first-rate. Provided you don't think too much, this is a highly entertaining film. Sure, the Nazis didn't attempt such a mission, but I enjoyed this alternative history movie.",The Eagle Has Landed
1,TheLittleSongbird,The Eagle hasn't landed as well as it should...,5,18 June 2011,"The Eagle Has Landed is watchable, but considering the cast it was disappointing at the same time. It does look good, if perhaps lacking grit, with great cinematography, several sequences are very well shots and the production values are promising. Most of the action is hefty and exciting, John Sturges' direction is credible and the acting is good enough with Michael Caine and Donald Pleasance faring best. However, some of the characters don't convince, especially the Germans as a lurking party, and the screenplay feels rather ramshackle in places. My two main problems with The Eagle Has Landed are the pace and some of the story. The pace does feel rambling sometimes, making the film longer than it is, and the story while interesting at hindsight is far fetched and implausible. Also the second half is better than the first, the first hour or so takes far too long to set up, but the second hour has more suspense and tension. Overall, uneven and didn't quite work as well it should have done, but it is watchable with some entertainment parts. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Eagle Has Landed
2,bkoganbing,A random act of kindness by a Nazi,6,18 November 2017,"Because he's upset the hard line Nazis of the S.S., paratroop commander Michael Caine and his men are sent on a suicide mission, to go to Great Britain and bring about the capture or death of Winston Churchill. The Nazis have intelligence that the Prime Minister will be on the coast inspecting fortifications and will be spending one night at a particular coastal village.The mission is to go in as Free Polish soldiers and take up residence in said coastal village. But ironically are given away by a random act of kindness by one of the Germans. After that Caine and his men are on their own.Ironically it's in English history that one finds a parallel for the predicament Caine is in. Sir Walter Raleigh under a death sentence, but the warrant unexecuted spent some 15 years in the Tower Of London until James I sent him on a mission to South America to find gold in the Orinoco River country of what is now Venezuela. No gold and Raleigh came back to face the ax. This was John Sturges's last action/adventure film and he put together a fine ensemble cast. English actors Anthony Quayle and Donald Pleasence play Admiral Carnaris and S.S. head Heinrich Himmler. John Standing is the village vicar, Treat Williams is American army captain, Jean Marsh is an enemy spy in the village and Judy Geeson is Standing's sister and a WREN. Standing out however in the cast is Donald Sutherland as a former IRA man who has gone over to the Nazis and he also is an enemy agent who gets a chance to fall in love with local Jenny Agutter. And Larry Hagman is a thick as a brick army colonel who blunders into the situation and bungles badly. the Gomer Pyle of colonels.Of course we know how this ends because history tells us Churchill was not assassinated. Or do you? You might be in for a surprise.",The Eagle Has Landed
3,Leofwine_draca,A pitch-perfect novel adaptation,8,8 April 2017,"THE EAGLE HAS LANDED is a great little 'what if?' WW2 movie, based on a novel by popular thriller writer Jack Higgins. The film features an all-star cast and a wonderfully gritty 1970s-era thriller atmosphere, in which the focus is on realism throughout rather than endless explosive action and the like. It's the final film in the career of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN director John Sturges, and it's a rather grand effort.The plot is a little similar to that of WENT THE DAY WELL. Himmler decides on a plan to kidnap Winston Churchill from Norfolk, and a crack team of Nazi troops are sent in undercover to get the job done. The first hour is all set up but it's never less than engaging, but it's once the troops arrive in England that the fun and endless tension really starts. Michael Caine is a typically likable lead and Donald Sutherland and Jenny Agutter share an unusual romance. The action, when it hits, is quite electrifying, and the film is unpredictable enough to keep you on your toes throughout. I loved it.",The Eagle Has Landed
4,SnoopyStyle,high adventure,7,13 May 2016,"Mussolini is rescued by German special forces. Hitler supported by Himmler (Donald Pleasence) has an idea to kidnap British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The one-eyed Max Radl (Robert Duvall) is ordered to command the operation. He recruits IRA member Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland) in Berlin. Churchill is visiting Studley Constable in Norfolk. Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine) leads a squad of experienced troops from the eastern front. He's weary of the Nazis and tries to save a girl from the cattle train. For that, they are forced to take part in the impossible mission. Devlin sneaks into the country and joins up with sleeper agent Joanna Grey (Jean Marsh). Local Molly Prior (Jenny Agutter) falls for charming Devlin. The squad parachutes in dressed as Polish troops. Opposing them is the pompous US Army Colonel Pitts (Larry Hagman) and his more competent second-in-command Captain Clark (Treat Williams).This is a fun war high adventure. It's got funny scenes and some good action. The main thing holding it back is the reversal of roles. It's harder to root for the Germans in a WWII movie. It tries very hard to make Michael Caine a hero in this despite the German uniform. The story is highly unlikely but it's not really surreal. Plot believability goes out the window in this one.",The Eagle Has Landed
5,Prismark10,Get Winston,4,3 January 2017,"The Eagle has Landed is a hammy, rambling film which takes it all too seriously.In WWII a German unit led by Colonel Steiner (Michael Caine) and his men (previously imprisoned for disobeying orders) are parachuted into the Norfolk countryside, impersonate some Polish soldiers fighting for the British and plan to kidnap Winston Churchill who is due to visit the area.The Germans have sent in an IRA spy, Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland) to lay the groundwork. Everything is going well until a girl falls into a pond and one of the soldiers exposes his identity when he jumps in to rescue her. The nearby US army base is alerted that the village has been invaded and prepare for battle.John Sturges who made The Great Escape is rather po faced here. It lacks some underlying humour although Donald Sutherland and Larry Hagman try to provide it haphazardly. It is just that in 1976 when there was an IRA bombing campaign in full swing in the British mainland, very few Britons wanted quips from an IRA comedy sidekick.The pacing of the film is uneven and Caine tries to show a heroic side to the Nazis, he even tries to aid a Jewish woman escape.",The Eagle Has Landed
6,claudio_carvalho,A Good Entertainment,8,11 April 2004,"In September of 1943, Col. Max Radl (Robert Duvall) develops a plan, approved by Heinrich Himmler (Donald Pleasance), to kidnap or kill Winston Churchill in England. The rebel Col. Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine),who is arrested with his men due to insubordination, is invited to participate, since he has had a British education. They would have clean records and recover their military patents again. The condition not negotiable of Col. Kurt to accept the mission is that his men wear the German uniform below their costumes, since they are soldiers and not spies. The group, dressed like Polish soldiers, together with the Irish Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland), goes to a coastal town, where Churchill is supposed to pass through. An incident with a girl reveals their plot to the local civilians, jeopardizing their mission. Having an outstanding cast and the direction of John Sturges, this movie is a great entertainment, having drama, suspense, action and some comedy in right doses. Fans of war movies will certainly like it. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'A Águia Pousou'(' The Eagle Has Landed')",The Eagle Has Landed
7,jboothmillard,The Eagle Has Landed,4,4 July 2011,"From director John Sturges (Bad Day at Black Rock, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape), I recognised the title because of the leading British actor, so I was going to watch, and while watching I recognised the star of Deep Impact wearing the eye patch. Basically, set in World War II, Colonel Oberst Kurt Steiner (Sir Michael Caine) is the German parachute unit commander has been court marshaled for opposing the capture of Jews, he is sent to England on a mission to kidnap the Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. One man helping in whatever way he can to pull this off is Irish man Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland) with the identity of The Eagle, but he is distracted by falling in love with local girl Molly Prior (Jenny Agutter). Eye patch wearing Colonel Oberst Radl (Robert Duvall) gets involved as well with the reports of Churchill visiting the country's eastern coast, of course all the Nazis are under the orders of Heinrich Himmler (Donald Pleasence), one of Adolf Hitler's right hand men. There is a point when the Germans are forced to hold people hostage in a town church, including Father Verecker (John Standing), to avoid the American army, led by Colonel Pitts (Dallas's Larry Hagman), and it turns into a small battle. In the end, the particular characters (that didn't exist in history) get what they deserve, and it turns out that Churchill wasn't actually in the country, it was a lookalike. Also starring Lawrence of Arabia's Anthony Quayle as Admiral Canaris, Jean Marsh as Joanna Grey, Sven-Bertil Taube as Captain Von Neustadt, Judy Geeson as Pamela, Treat Williams as Captain Clark, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's Michael Byrne as Karl and Grease's Jeff Conaway as Frazier. Caine does not bother to try a German accent, Sutherland tries to be Irish but isn't completely convincing, I remember seeing clips of Duvall who was quite good, Pleasance makes a surprisingly charming Himmler, and some of the other cast members are reasonable as well. It is obviously based on books and not any real events in the war, if it was tweaked a bit it could have worked as a convincing story, but there are not enough action scenes and only one real life figure featured, it's not a terrible second world war adventure. Okay!",The Eagle Has Landed
8,ccthemovieman-1,Strong Second Half Saves Boring First Hour,7,10 January 2006,"I almost gave up on this film after the first hour. It was just too slow for me and I was having difficulty picking up some of dialog with the foreign accents (no subtitles are offered on the DVD).However, once the ""invasion"" started the film was very interesting. The only ridiculous part was the role played by Larry Hagman. Liberal Hollywood loves to portray every Southerner as a gung-ho, out-of-control military freak. If I was from the South, I would have been highly offended at this stereotype.What's really different about this film is that it's a World War II story told from the German side where the Germans are pictured as humane people. You don't see that too much from English-speaking filmmakers.Michael Caine is the most likable of these people, one of those given the assignment of kidnapping Winston Churchill (interesting premise, off the best- selling book by Jack Higgins). Donald Sutherland plays an Irishman recruited to help in the kidnapping and he's fun to watch.This is really a man's movie, something like ""The Guns Of Navarone,"" but they inserted Jenny Agutter in here to give the viewers a pretty face and some romance, even though it has absolutely no bearing on the story.Robert Duvall, Jean Marsh, Treat Williams, Donald Pleasance and Anthony Quayle are some of the other ""name"" actors who contribute. All in all, a pretty good movie if you can get by that first hour!",The Eagle Has Landed
9,rmax304823,Perplexing war movie.,5,28 December 2005,"No, it's not about the first moon landings, although it sounds as if it should be. It's about a group of German soldiers led by Michael Caine and aided by Donald Southerland as an Irishman, who parachute into England in an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill and bring an end to the war. They fail, which can't be too big a surprise.The movie's plot is all over the place. Caine and his men are disguised as British paratroopers and they more or less take over a small British village, claiming to be on an exercise. But they wear their German uniforms under their fake British uniforms, and one of the men while saving the life of a young girl, dies and has his true identity revealed. This happens rather early in the movie, so the whole disguise business lasts only about 15 minutes. After that, the movie becomes routine. The Germans strip to field gray and hole up in a church. They are surrounded and outnumbered by American rangers and fight to the death, although it's not clear why they just don't surrender. The war is nearly over.What lifts the movie a bit above the expectable -- and this may be completely accidental -- is that it's not easy for the average viewer, used to watching less complicated material like Funniest Home Videos, to figure out which side to root for.The Germans of course have been fighting for an evil cause. Yet, in this instance at least, they are men of probity and honor. Their goal is not to assassinate Churchill (if that can be avoided) but to put the snatch on him and try to negotiate a settlement with the Allies. And you can tell the people who made the movie did not want a horde of hairy Huns playing goose-stepping Nazi types because the soldiers look like young men. One of them seems to be still in his teens and plays Bach on the church organ.And the U. S. Army that we see is led by a Colonel who is, as far as it's possible to tell, a complete idiot. The actor, Larry Hagman, hams it up outrageously, but it doesn't come across as comic, just stupid. His Colonel is so puffed up with ego, so angry at not having been allowed to see combat, that he chews out subordinates all the time and struts around with tiny mincing steps. When a woman finally puts a bullet through his head and he looks a little indignant -- well, it almost funny but not quite.Donald Southerland is a stage Irishman of a type we've seen before -- all charm and rosy cheeks. He laughs gaily at the prospect of putting his life in danger. He's romantic, falls in love with the wrong girl, likes a drop now and then, and is always ready for a fist fight.At the end, Caine finds himself in a position to shoot and kill Churchill. His face turns grim. He approaches the PM who stares at him with horror, and he deliberately shoots the guy. (Who turns out to be a mere stand-in for the real Churchill.) I don't know why he did that. It's not really in keeping with what we've seen of Caine's character so far. He's a proud man but not a cold-blooded murderer. I suspect the scene is in there to give the audience a momentary frisson -- ""WHAT? Churchill DEAD?"" It's pretty corny but then there are other banal scenes throughout the movie. The true identity of the Germans is revealed only through the hoary device of having one of the soldiers save an enemy's daughter from drowning and giving his own life in the process.The script is poor and the direction ordinary but the performances are competent enough, given what the actors have to work with. Jenny Agutter's nose turns up like a ski jump, like the inverted clipper bow of a Japanese battleship, like the trajectory of a freshly launched shuttle from Cape Canaveral. Any normal man would want to kiss it and bite it a little. Judy Geason looks just fine too. It wasn't nice of the writers to have her shot, but at least she survives.",The Eagle Has Landed
10,Tweekums,A decent war film with a twist,7,29 August 2012,"This film is unusual in that it is set during the Second World War but follows the actions of a German unit; Colonel Steiner and his men have been ordered to parachute into Norfolk and kidnap Winston Churchill during a visit to the county. To enable them to pass unnoticed by the locals the unit dress in the uniforms of Polish paratroopers. They aren't the only people working for their cause in the area; there is also an Irish spy, Liam Devlin, who arrived shortly before them and Joanna Grey, a South African woman who has lived in the area for some time. Everything is going according to plan until one of the village children falls into the mill pond; one of the Germans dives in and rescues her; he is drowned though and as he is caught up on the mill wheel the German uniform he was wearing under the Polish one is exposed. Now they must take the villagers hostage in the church until Churchill arrives. One of the villagers manages to escape and alerts the Americans stationed nearby... it looks as if it is all over for the Germans but Steiner manages to escape and makes a daring attempt to get to Churchill.It made a refreshing change to see a war film from the side of German soldiers; we are clearly meant to think of them as 'Good Germans' we even see Steiner attempt to save the life of a Jewish woman and Admiral Canaris, the man ordered by Hitler to prepare the plan went to the trouble of listing just about every major Nazi and suggesting they were mad! The acting was solid; I particularly liked Michael Caine's portrayal of Steiner and while some might have disliked Larry Hagman's portrayal of US Colonel Pitts I thought it was an entertaining portrayal of a man desperate to see action before his war was over. The only real criticism of the acting is of Donald Sutherland's Irish accent which seemed doubly bad when the character claimed to come from Belfast! The action was fairly solid and looked believable to my non-expert eye. The romantic subplot between Devlin and local girl Molly, played by Jenny Agutter, wasn't really necessary although it did serve to show he had a caring side.If you want to watch a slightly different war film I'd certainly recommend this; and if you enjoy this I'd recommend checking out the similarly themed 'Went the Day Well'; another film about Germans taking over an English village but this time made while the war was still very much on!",The Eagle Has Landed
11,ma-cortes,Stirring warlike movie about a Nazi commando attempting a risked operation in England,6,4 April 2008,"After Mussolini's valiant rescue by Scorzeny, the Furher Hitler orders Winston Churchill can be kidnapped and taken to Germany and assigns Admiral Wilhelm Canaris(Anthony Quayle) to make a viability plot. Lieutenant Colonel (Robert Duvall)in charge schemes an intelligent plan and reports to Himmler(Donald Pleasance). He commissions an Irish(Donald Sutherland), English hating, and a German officer named Steiner(Michael Caine) and his parachute equipment. Steiner is imprisoned for confronting about rounding up Jews . His mission concerns pose as Polish soldiers on a training maneuver in a small British town where live simple citizens, as a beautiful young girl (Jenny Agutter), a spinster(Jean Marsh) and the parish priest(John Standing), among others. When the Prime Minister Winston Churchill appear, the infiltrators bent on abducting him. But near encounter an American detachment, commanded by a colonel(Larry Hagman) and a captain(Treat Williams).This memorable WWII action movie displays suspense, thrills, drama, shootouts and spectacular scenes. Based on Jack Higgings' best-seller novel with an interesting screenplay by Tom Mankiewicz, though weak on the silly relationship between Donald Sutherland and Jenny Agutter. Large casting with good performances, as a first rate acting for Michael Caine and Robert Duvall. Excellent plethora of secondaries actors,Anthony Quayle, Judy Geeson, John Standing and Treat Williams film debut. The film belongs the warlike commandos genre which in the 60s and 70s achieved splendor, as the picture takes parts, here and there from : ¨When the eagles dare(Brian G Hutton), Dirty dozen(Robert Aldrich) and Kelly's heroes(Brian G Hutton)¨. Sensible and fitting to action musical score by Lalo Schifrin and atmospheric cinematography by Anthony Richmond. The motion picture is well directed thanks capable hands of filmmaker John Sturges. He's a warlike genre expert(Great escape, Never so few) and Western master(Gunfight OK Corral,Last train of Gun Hill,The law and Jake Wade). Well worth seeing, the movie will like to Michael Caine, Robert Duvall fans.",The Eagle Has Landed
12,searchanddestroy-1,The German Screaming Eagles: the Fallschirmjäger.,8,27 December 2020,"The Fallschirmjager were the elite paratroopers of the Third Reich, whose only and most memorable airborne mission was in Crete, where they lost many of them. Of course they also participated in Netherlands and Belgium invasion in 1940. Besides those few airborne missions, as the Russian paras, they only remained on ground missions.. This movie is a fiction, so far, it has never been proved that Hitler planned to kidnap or even kill Churchill. But after all, nothing is impossible. Anyway, there are two things I want to say. First, Donald Pleasance gives here a terrific performance as Himmler, because he looked so much like the SS leader. Same face and eyes. Very close; he was the best actor ever to play him. Second thing is that this movie is the only one in US or even British movie history to talk about the German paratroopers, to show them as the lead characters. You had a German film about Monte Cassino battle, which of course evoked their heroic but hopeless fight in the Italian Stalingrad for Nazis. That's very rare for Americans to show Germans this way. Donald Sutherland will play, five years later, in another WW2 feature: EYE OF THE NEEDLE, in which he will be a Nazi spy in England. One last thing, the scene where the paras face the SS troops because of a young Jewish child whom the leader of the paras wants to help, this scene actually occurred in Holland, shortly before Market Garden operation began, in September 1944. The SS did not insist in front of the Fallschirmjäger determination surrounding the SS who pointed their weapons against the paras leader. Those German paras were not Nazis but unfortunately fought on the same side as criminals. For a criminal and inhuman ideology.",The Eagle Has Landed
13,hitchcockthelegend,It could make The Charge Of The Light Brigade look like military genius.,7,9 October 2008,"A small Norfolk village in England is suddenly the focal point for a Polish regiment's training exercise. It would seem they are not all they are saying they are, so with Winston Churchill due to visit the village, there is something seriously afoot.Written by Jack Higins, directed by John Sturges {The Great Escape} and starring Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland and Robert Duvall, The Eagle Has Landed is a different sort of war movie. Flipping the axis to a German point of view and having English and American actors playing the Germans, is a bold move that, fluctuating accents aside, makes for a totally engrossing picture. Offering a fair bit more than your standard film of men on a suicide mission for the war effort, the piece's pulp origins, and its idyllic country setting give it a quality that ensures the viewers attention stays firmly with the film's steadily paced first half. Also adding intrigue into this already interesting broth is that our main Nazi protagonist is not down with the whole killing Jews thing. It's very sly in how it pans out, its not asking the audience to feel sympathy with Steiner {Caine professionally impacting}, it's just proclaiming that not all people should be tarred with the same brush.Mostly the cast are fine and boosted by a brilliant turn from Donald Sutherland as an IRA spy helping the Germans, Robert Duvall, Donald Pleasance, Anthony Quayle, Jenny Agutter and Jean Marsh all are solid within the picture's structure. Oddly the performance of Larry Hagman as the appropriately named Colonel Pitts sticks out like a sore thumb, buffoonery in bravado intent it's difficult to tell if it's meant to be comic relief or a statement of how the British viewed the yanks at this time? A young Treat Williams as Capt. Harry Clark ensures that not all American soldiers in the film come off as dunderheads. Playing out more as a mystery with it's various twists and turns, and seeping with tension amidst the village folk, The Eagle Has Landed is an odd sort of picture, but it certainly delivers enough to make it way above average. 6.5/10",The Eagle Has Landed
14,Theo Robertson,Worth Watching But Only Because Of The Fine Cast,6,25 June 2005,"Jack Higgins ? Surely one the most clichéd commercial writers there has ever been . Maybe he's not the worst writer to make millionaire status since there's a lot of competition for that tag like Harold Robbins , Jackie Collins or even that dreadful hack called Rowling who has conned a lot of children out of their pocket money by publishing the same mediocre book year after year , but certainly as a writer Higgins is rather poor and it's no surprise that for many years film producers are totally disinterested in buying the movie rights to his stories THE EAGLE HAS LANDED is a typical Higgins story - Clichéd and with a ludicrous plot . What's it about ? A bunch of German paratroopers disguised as Poles drop into Norfolk in 1943 on a mission to kidnap Winston Churchill thereby bring about a negotiated settlement with the Western allies ? Can anyone see a flaw with this plot ? If you wonder what I'm talking about please read a history book on the second world war . Found it yet ? You might notice that Churchill was never kidnapped by German paratroopers which leads even the most ignorant audience member to have a rough idea of how the movie will end . On top of all that you find yourself comparing the movie to the far more superior Graham Greene adaptation of WENT THE DAY WELL which features a very similar plot But it's the clichés that really get me with this movie . I don't doubt that from 1939-45 many Germans disliked Nazism and were disgusted by the genocidal policies of the party , but watching this movie you'd think EVERYONE was physically opposed to Nazism . Kurt Stiener ( A banal German name but better that Schmidt I guess ) assaults a totenkopf officer and vainly tries to save a Jewish woman from a death squad in Poland . Yup happened all the time I imagine , while Liam Devlin is mistaken as a gestapo member in a bar , has whisky poured over him and thrown through a window . Yes I'm sure if someone has the power of life and death over you and your family and you slightly disagreed with their racial politics you too would want to give them a piece of your mind . Oh I've just looked up a history book called History Of The Second World War And Why Germany Lost by Jack Higgins that fails to mention the lack of resources Germany had , or the slow degradation of its industrial power by allied bombing or massive loss of manpower suffered on the Eastern front , instead he states Germany lost the war because the average German hated the Nazis more than they hated the countries they were at war with ! If the clichés aren't bad enough we also have to endure some ridiculous plot devices . IRA man Liam Devlin ( Who wants to overthrow the British empire without blowing up innocent passers by - Yawn ) embarks on a relationship with a local girl within five minutes of landing in Norfolk . I guess this is to lull a potential female audience into the story , but would any woman be interested in a Jack Higgins story ? Would anyone with any common sense be interested in a Higgins story ! Oh and not wanting to be shot as spies the German wear their Luftwaffe uniforms under their Polish uniforms . Let me see now , they don't want to be shot as spies so if they wear their own uniforms under their disguise this will protect them under the terms laid out by the Geneva convention ! Actually it won't because they're spies / assassins . Of course this is another plot device , another daft plot device This is a really stupid movie but I have no hesitation in awarding it six out of ten simply because the cast go out of their way to rise above the material . Michael Caine was infamous in the mid to late 1970s to taking on roles that were obviously just to pay the rent but he manages to make Kurt Stiener as well rounded and as affable as a thinly written cypher can be . Donald Sutherland steals every scene he's in but it's Robert Duvall who gives the stand out performance as a German Oberst . It's a very subtle performance in which his body language says far more about his character than the written dialogue . Uanfortunately Larry Hagman gives a terrible performance as an American officer . Remember the sheriff in THE DUKES OF HAZZARD ? I'm sure that was inspired by Hagman's performance here",The Eagle Has Landed
15,Doylenf,Entertaining war drama with plenty of explosive moments...,7,26 May 2008,"John Sturges directed some fine movies in his time and THE EAGLE HAS LANDED is certainly one of them. It's a shame it isn't a better known war film, its fictional plot about an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill coming from a best-seller by Jack Higgins.The plot is heavy going at times, particularly the whole first hour leading up to the planned landing, and some of the dialog--heavily accented Germans--is not easy to understand without subtitles. This is a serious drawback for setting up this complex mission and establishing everything for the viewer, but the second half of the film has enough visual excitement, action and tension to make up for the talky first half.MICHAEL CAINE is excellent as a German paratrooper commando posing as a Polish military man with his group of invaders when they land to carry out their mission. ROBERT DUVALL is effective as German Col. Radl and there are good performances from DONALD PLEASANCE as Himmler, DONALD SUTHERLAND as an IRA loyalist who has a brief affair with JENNY AGUTTER, JOHN STANDING (excellent as a brave pastor), LARRY HAGMAN, as a cartoonish sort of ""Mad Max"" colonel, and TREAT WILLIAMS as a young Captain.It builds its tension steadily once the men have landed to complete their mission and there are many unexpected moments where anything can happen and usually does. It's all highly unpredictable and that's part of the fun in following the absorbing plot with its slight twist at the end.Visually, it's a pleasure to watch, photographed as it is in Finland and Great Britain in gorgeous color and featuring a score by Lalo Schafrin that adds to the excitement and tension.Summing up: Should be more widely known among all the war films produced during the '70s.",The Eagle Has Landed
16,zardoz-13,A Sensible Military Exercise,10,10 September 2009,"John Sturges' last film ""The Eagle Has Landed"" came out about the same time as Sam Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" and Andrew V. McLaglen's ""Breakthrough,"" and all three concerned so-called 'good' German soldiers, not the heartless Nazis. Of course, 'good' German soldiers had been around as early as Marlon Brando in ""The Young Lions,"" but that was at the tail end of the 1950s. These World War II movies belonged to the post-Vietnam era and most of them were international productions. ""The Eagle Has Landed"" is an engrossing espionage actioneer that takes place in 1943 when Adolph Hitler decides to dispatch an elite group of German commandos to England to capture his greatest enemy Winston Churchill after a previous band of intrepid Germans rescued Benito Mussolini from his captors. The thing that sets ""The Eagle Has Landed"" apart from most World War II thrillers is that the Germans ordered on the raid are good guy Germans. Early in the action, Oberst Steiner (Michael Caine) and his men interfere when the Gestapo are rounding up Jews for extermination in the concentration camp. Specifically, Steiner and his men try to help a young Jewish woman escape. They manage to put her on a train during a stand-off between Steiner's men and the Nazis. However, a Nazi sharp-shooter kills the girl, and the Gestapo pour into the railway station and surround our heroes. Steiner and his men are reprimanded and sent to France to ride torpedoes into Allied shipping.Meanwhile, Colonel Max Radl (Robert Duvall of ""The Godfather"")is a wounded German officer who is ordered to present a feasibility study about how to either capture or kill Churchill. He discovers that Steiner speaks English fluently and that a double agent, Miss Joanna Grey (Jean Marsh),knows when Churchill will be vulnerable for kidnapping. Eventually, Steiner takes command of the remaining sixteen men in his command, and they bail out over the English coast and rendezvous with a double-agent working in the village where Churchill plans to spend a quiet weekend. As Liam Devlin, Donald Sutherland of ""The Dirty Dozen"" plays a sarcastic IRA gunman who poses as a marsh warden to help Steiner. Devlin finds himself in trouble with one of the town locals when he takes up with Molly Prior (Jenny Agutter of ""Logan's Run"")who reciprocates his interest.John Sturges, who directed ""The Great Escape"" and Never So Few,"" maintains a brisk pace throughout this complicated 134 minute war movie and the momentum never flags. ""Live and Let Die"" scenarist Tom Mankiewicz has done a splendid job of adapting Jack Higgins' international best-seller with one exception. The American colonel in the novel is not the imbecile that Colonel Pitts is in the movie. Basically, it looks like Mankiewicz resurrected James Bond sheriff J.W. Pepper and put him in an army uniform. Nevertheless, Mankiewicz has written some fine dialogue. Once they reach England the commandos occupy the village and seal it off. What they don't count on is one of the villagers escapinf to warn a nearby base where a complete cretin of an American military officer Colonel Pitts(Larry Hagman) is in command. Pitts organizes an attack, and the Germans riddle the hell out of them. British actor Donald Pleasence is a dead ringer for Himmler. Sturges does a marvelous job of staging the multi-pronged attack by Pitts' men on the village. Composer Lalo Schifrin of ""Joe Kidd"" underlines every suspenseful minute of this film with his atmospheric orchestral score. The marching score when the Germans bail out and land in the surf is memorable. The surprise ending is a knock-out.",The Eagle Has Landed

18,Boba_Fett1138,Not the best example of WW II/action-movie making but it has some great moments.,7,12 January 2006,"The concept of the movie is both great and original but however the execution of it is not exactly done in the best way possible.The movie starts of very slow and even perhaps a bit boring. Thankfuly the second halve of the movie is much better once the action and story really start and take more pace and form. It might not be as entertaining and good as other WW II/action movies, meant as entertainment, such as ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""Kelly's Heroes"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"" but it does have some great moments in it which still helps to make ""The Eagle Has Landed"" a bit of a must see for the fans of the genre.The story is just great and its interesting to see a movie for once from the perspective of the German side. For once the Germans are not portrayed as ruthless villains but as soldiers with valor and courage instead. The movie is perhaps a bit moralistic in the first halve of the movie (basicly every German soldier shown in the movie openly hates Hitler and is against the deportation of Jews to the concentration camps. It feels too forced all) but nevertheless the perspective the movie is told from is great and works good for the movie. It's too bad that the movie is told needlessly slow at times, while it could had been a great fast paced action-movie.The movie has a great cast but this is not really an actors movie, meaning that the movie wouldn't had been any better or worse with some other lesser known names in it. It was weird to hear Donald Sutherland talking in an Irish accent and Robert Duvall with a German one. Also Treat Williams in one of his first movie roles was horrible as the American soldier Capt. Clark. On the other hand, it was great to see Donald Pleasance as Heinrich Himmler. Other big names in this movie are Michael Caine, Anthony Quayle and Jean Marsh.The action sequences are good and definitely the best part of the movie. The movie is somewhat entertaining to watch and it does have some well placed humor at times but its not quite enough to truly uplift this movie to a level of greatness.This last movie from director John Sturges is a memorable but not perfect one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Eagle Has Landed
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Good acting, but poor script and dull plot",7,25 September 2004,"When dealing with fiction, it's mostly easy to make it entertaining. When dealing with non-fiction, true, historically correct stories, you have to make an effort to keep it true to facts; however, you still have to make it entertaining, otherwise, everyone but the historians and story-loving audiences will find it less than worth their time; and that is exactly what went wrong here. As far as I know, this film is fairly historically accurate(apart from the main plot-line, which I'm not entirely sure about). It's also well-acted and the locations and costumes are authentic. Thing is, that's all it is; authentic, historically accurate(to a certain extent, at least) and well-acted. The film has little to no entertainment value. I realize that a war film shouldn't be a hilarious or something to cheer at(like an action flick, for example), but it can at least show it's audience the courtesy of being slightly interesting, apart from the plot(which, I think, to some extent deviates from what really happened, in a typical Hollywood fashion) which seems predictable and is easily figured out from the very beginning, simply due to it obviously trying hard to be historically accurate, which negates the tension that the last scenes are trying to build. Even in the very end, which contains a twist(obviously designed to build tension) is predictable and almost immediately figured out. The plot is somewhat good, it's just too predictable and virtually everyone will figure out how it's going to end, save for the historically ignorant(who probably won't see the movie anyway). The pacing is bad, unless, once again, you're interested in seeing this for the historical accuracy. The film never really seemed to take off, until the last half hour or so, when you've stopped caring about the plot. The acting is very good; pretty much the only thing worthwhile in this movie. The characters are well-written(I guess, but they are based on real people, so there's not much room to go wrong there) and mostly credible. The cinematography is nothing memorable. The costumes and locations are very authentic and well done. All in all, not a particularly good film, but worth watching for fans of (fairly) historically accurate war films, and fans of the various actors, since they all give great performances. Anyone else should avoid this. There are far better war movies out there. 7/10",The Eagle Has Landed

25,Red-Barracuda,A potentially good war movie undermined by a several irritating aspects,4,15 November 2021,"I was looking forward to this one but it became obvious quite quickly that its got quite a few problems. Set during WWII, its about a German mission where a special forces unit is sent to Britain to capture Winston Churchill. One of the first issues, is that this crack unit is led by Michael Caine. Yes, Michael Caine plays a German in this one! Not only that but he and his men are 'good Germans', i.e. Ones disgusted by the Nazis. To this end, the mission falls on its arse when one of the men saves a young girl who is in danger of drowning and in the event dies himself, revealing his German uniform which he was wearing below the Polish one he was wearing as an undercover agent. Yes, I didn't mention that earlier - this crack special forces unit insist on WEARING THEIR GERMAN UNIFORMS UNDERNEATH, so as to ease their conscience and not technically be spies. Naturally, they are allowed to do this by the German high command - of course they are, they've only been tasked with kidnapping the British Prime Minister - its low profile lads, just wear your Nazi uniforms underneath, no one will notice, probably. Its a severe case of biscuit-taking nonsense. The very fact too that the operation fails on account of one of the good Germans saving a little girl, is unforgivably sappy - they might as well have had the operation undermined with one of the men exposing his German uniform while saving a kitten directly after setting up a factory which makes walking sticks for the elderly.The normally reliable Donald Sutherland doesn't help matters either. He appears here as an Irish republican who hates the British so much, that he helps the German's in this mission. Fair enough you might say, but the film-makers clearly intend us to love him and Sutherland plays him in the most cringe-inducing Oirish manner - of which appears annoyingly regularly in movies - his insufferable cheeky chappy salt-of-the-earth Oirish inanity has to be weighed up with the fact his character is assisting the extermination of the Jewish race in Europe...the utter git. Much better was the other Donald of the movies, namely Pleasence who really was quite excellent as Heinrich Himmler. This bit of war hokum should have been more entertaining but in the final analysis there were just too many irritating elements in it. I'm going for a lie down now.",The Eagle Has Landed
26,bensonmum2,"""By this time next year pigeons are going to be crapping on statues of you across the whole damn state of Nebraska.""",5,17 November 2005,"The German's hatch a plan to kidnap Churchill. Using a local citizen sympathetic to the German cause and an IRA operative, the Nazis move a group of specially trained commandos into England disguised as Polish paratroopers. But their cover is quickly blown while on maneuvers when one of the German soldier's true identity is revealed after he jumps into a canal to save a little girl. It's up to some U.S. National Guard troops stationed nearby to root out the Nazis and save Churchill.It's hard for me to put a finger on it, but there's just something about The Eagle Has Landed that's not quite right. I've narrowed it down to a couple of things that really distract from my overall enjoyment of the movie. The first is obvious - Larry Hagman's performance as Col. Pitts. To be blunt, he's terrible. For whatever reason, John Sturges had Hagman play his character as comic relief. It's completely out of place and really harms the mood of the movie. A ""straight"" performance would have been much more preferable.The second thing I find distracting about the movie is very difficult to explain, but it has something to do with the overall look of the film. Other than a few shots of gore as the American soldiers are being hit by bullets, much of the movie has a cheap, made-for-TV look to it that also takes away from the tone of the movie. It's not as ""gritty"" looking (for lack of a better word) as it should be. The battle scene doesn't look as real as it should. The soldiers look like actors.That's not to say that I don't find things enjoyable about The Eagle Has Landed. Other than Hagman, the acting is first-rate. Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Robert Duvall, and Donald Pleasence give terrific performances. The plot is an interesting idea although I would have preferred more on the planning of the kidnapping. Not being much of a student of history I have no idea how much is true, but it certainly seems feasible as presented. And finally, I really enjoy the Nazi operative played by Jean Marsh. The look on her face after her cover is blown and the local priest confronts her is priceless. It's a nice moment of acting.",The Eagle Has Landed
27,filipemanuelneto,Pure entertainment in a film that may displease some audiences.,6,27 April 2020,"In this film, we witness a secret military operation orchestrated without the consent of the German high command, with the aim of kidnapping Winston Churchill.Directed by John Sturges, it is an action film with a few touches of adventure and tells a straightforward but unlikely story about a military operation that, of course, never happened in real life. If we start to analyse the script well, we will see that it is full of holes and flaws, but the film was not made to be taken seriously. The film has a boring first half, where we watch several dialogues and preparations and plans. Much of this could have been shortened in time to privilege the action itself and make the film shorter and more fun to watch.The cast is quite competent and does a good job. Although the film is clearly entertainment and adventure, the actors seem to be totally committed and focused. I especially liked the performance of Michael Caine, excellent as a Polish officer in the service of the Germans, Donald Pleasence as Himmler and Robert Duvall, a German colonel who decides to proceed with a military operation without any authorization to do so. Donald Sutherland also did an excellent job, on a character who is unexpectedly beaten by the beauty of Jenny Agutter's character. The production values are good, with good photography and vivid colours, good action scenes, excellent sound and special effects and a good soundtrack.The biggest problems are the improbability of the script, which seems totally impossible to believe and may displease those looking for a more credible story, and a very slow first half, which can make many people give up watching the rest.",The Eagle Has Landed

30,l_rawjalaurence,Plausible Study of Wartime Behavior as Well as Being a Good Actioner,8,2 September 2014,"To lovers of movie curiosities, THE EAGLE HAS LANDED offers the unique experience of watching actors speak in funny accents, whether it be Michael Caine's Cockney German, Jean Marsh's English Afrikaans, Robert Duvall's impeccable RP English, or (best of all) Donald Sutherland's Irish blarney. Beneath such superficialities, however, there lies a movie that makes some important points about human behavior during wartime. In one important sequence at the beginning, Caine's Col. Steiner is shown saving a Jewish girl from the clutches of the SS, even though he risks almost certain punishment as a result. Confronting the Obergruppenfuhrer (Joachim Hansen), Steiner makes an important point about showing humanity - even to one's sworn enemies. When a young girl falls into the jaws of a water-wheel, he sanctions one of his officers to go and rescue her, even if by doing so the officer reveals his true identity as a Nazi agent Steiner shows the same concern for the welfare of his men during their daring raid on England, and expects the same in return. When a wounded officer refuses to board the tug-boat taking him to safety, Steiner reminds him of his responsibilities as a human being, as well as being a member of Steiner's force: the officer has to go, even if he doesn't want to.Steiner's concern for others renders him a highly ambiguous character. On the one hand we should fear his ruthlessness, his obsessive desire to carry out the mission to capture Churchill (Leigh Dilley), even if the odds are stacked against him. On the other hand we admire him for his enduring loyalty to his men. Sutherland's Liam Devlin, a collaborator in the plan, proves equally ambiguous, his ruthlessness as a fixer and fighter has to be balanced against his concern for young Molly (Jenny Agutter), a nineteen-year-old villager who finds the kind of inspiration in Devlin that she could never discover in her long-term English boyfriend Arthur (Keith Buckley). Even Duvall's Colonel Radl is not entirely evil - while sanctioning the plot to kidnap Churchill in the first place, he realizes the risks involved, both to Steiner and his men, as well as himself. At one point he advises a junior officer to return home from the Channel Islands back to Berlin, so as to avoid the inevitable punishment that will result from the failure of the entire operation.While John Sturges' film contains some exciting action sequences - the final shoot-out between the Nazis and the Americans is particularly dramatically handled, with the chocolate-box English village forming a backdrop - the main focus of interest centers on the characters. Even though the Americans are portrayed as 'good' characters, rescuing the terrified villagers from Nazi captivity, their leader Col. Pitts (Larry Hagman) is both inexperienced in combat and entirely selfish, refusing to listen to the (good) advice of the men he commands. As a result he leads his troops into dangerous situations that could have been avoided if he had been a little more meticulous in his planning. Compared to Steiner, he seems rough-and-ready, the kind of man to avoid rather than admire. We are left to reflect on the nature of leadership, a quality that transcends national loyalties. The film itself stands up very well after forty years, even though its basic subject-matter was not new, even at the time of release. Alberto Cavalcanti's WENT THE DAY WELL (1942), based on a Graham Greene story, offers a chilling account of what might have happened if the Nazis had landed in the United Kingdom. THE EAGLE HAS LANDED sketches an equally convincing portrait, even though the British villagers seem remarkably sanguine about the presence of invaders in their midst. One of them (John Barrett) sardonically remarks: ""Bloody foreigners again."" Nonetheless its story remains highly plausible with a good surprise ending. Definitely worth looking at more than once.",The Eagle Has Landed

32,barnabyrudge,"Generally gets the thumbs-up, but has a couple of slightly disappointing features.",6,13 May 2004,"Based on a best-selling tall story by Jack Higgins, and featuring an all-star cast that must've cost half the budget just to get to sign up for the project, The Eagle Has Landed is an enjoyable but slightly overlong wartime actioner. German soldier Max Radl (Robert Duvall) comes up with an audacious plot to deliver a devastating blow to the Allied forces by kidnapping Winston Churchill from a Norfolk village. A team of deadly German spies, led by Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine), are smuggled into England to carry out this sinister scheme. Aided by an Irish mercenary (Donald Sutherland), the German forces rapidly and ruthlessly close in on their target. Only an inexperienced American garrison, posted in a quiet corner of Norfolk, can stand in the way of a devastating German victory. The Eagle Has Landed is one of the few films where the all-star cast doesn't have a detrimental effect. In films like A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day, the presence of so many stars actually results in a game of ""star-spotting"", and this diverts the audience's attention away from important plot developments. In The Eagle Has Landed, each actor brings depth and charisma to their strongly written roles (especially Sutherland as the devious Irish rogue, and Duvall as an eye-patch wearing Nazi). This film's faults lie elsewhere. The opening hour and a quarter goes on rather too much and ought to have been trimmed by at least fifteen minutes. Also, the plot rides its luck with increasingly less likely, less plausible developments (especially the unpersuasive ""twist"" ending). For these reasons, The Eagle Has Landed isn't quite the excellent film you might be hoping for. What it is, however, is an enjoyable, well-acted and very watchable slice of escapism.",The Eagle Has Landed
33,I_Ailurophile,A pleasant surprise,8,9 February 2021,"This is not quite the movie I was expecting.There's no getting around the flashing neon lights that first catch one's eye here: What a cast! Michael Caine, Donald Pleasence, Robert Duvall, Treat Williams, Jean Marsh, Anthony Quayle, and Donald Sutherland, all in one place. As one would anticipate, Caine in particular is fantastic; Pleasence's role is rather understated, as many of his parts are. I can't remember the last time I watched so young a Donald Sutherland. And Jean Marsh has a small role, but it's a joy to see her, too.With this all-star ensemble, not being familiar with the novel it's based on, and considering how the plot centers the villains, I rather thought 'Eagle has landed' would be a serious war film. Imagine my surprise at seeing how casually and even playfully that many scenes unfold, from start to finish.Caine's Steiner may be on the wrong side of history, but he is nonetheless an honorable man, loyal to his country, and not his leader. The paratroopers Steiner leads convincingly play the part of congenial allies until the disguise slips, at which point the action kicks up and the film takes a more serious turn. The suspense only builds as the battle concludes and 'Eagle has landed' approaches the crucial moment. The conclusion is both unexpected and not, falling somewhere in the middle and nonetheless satisfying viewers' needs.And yet - before, during, and after, there is also an unorthodox B-plot in which Sutherland's IRA agent Devlin falls in love. This catches one's eye not just for the fact of its inclusion, but for how much time is devoted in the film to the burgeoning relationship. If the film struck a more serious tone generally then the romance would be so out of place as to mar the experience, but as it stands, it somehow fits.'Eagle has landed' carries itself very differently than any other war movie I can immediately name, its vibe coming across almost more like a fun adventure flick. It may be a turn-off to some to consider a less serious fictional tale depicting serious events in a dire time in history. But the narrative is solid, the screenplay believable, and the cast superb. it's not what I expected to view, but it's what I needed.I'd recommend this to just about anyone, I think.

A crack platoon of paratroopers are sent to pose as Polish soldiers on manoeuvres, commanded by the brilliant Colonel Steiner. But how long before their little ruse is discovered This is one of those great seventies international co-production war/adventure films (see also Kelly's Heroes or Cross Of Iron) which isn't interested in boring historical accuracy or realism, it just wants to entertain as much as possible. The casting of Caine, the world's most iconic Cockney, as a German Luftwaffe officer is cheeky beyond belief, but he is sensational; dogmatic, thoughtful - he just gets on with it, the way a good actor should. Duvall is also excellent as the chain-smoking, one-eyed Colonel Radl, explaining the whole plot without us ever realising that's what he's doing. These two straight-ahead performances allow Sutherland to be completely wild as a good-natured Irish mercenary, all mad eyed grinning and witty repartee. The supporting cast also features great bits by Marsh (as the village traitor), Agutter (in her patented English Rose mode), Pleasence (as Himmler) and Byrne (as Duvall's faithful adjutant). Based on a bestselling book by Jack Higgins, the plot is the best kind of adventure story - an insanely dangerous mission, honourable but desperate heroes, loads of action and a touch of romance. Scripted by Tom Mankiewicz, the premise is more than a little similar to an old British movie, Went The Day Well ? (minus the Churchill element), but is completely different stylistically. If there is one thing that lets it down a little I think it's the final act - the trigger for the discovery and the ensuing gun battles are excellent, but once the action moves beyond the village for the finale, it kind of runs out of steam a little, taking too long to set us up for a final twist. Featuring a fabulous pounding score by Lalo Schifrin and great photography throughout by the prolific Anthony Richmond. Produced by British TV mogul Lew Grade's ITC company, which made some great films (Capricorn One, The Dark Crystal, several others), the title refers to the Caine character, but is also of course the famous quote from the Apollo 11 moon landing. Shot mostly in the village of Mapledurham in Berkshire.

37,philip_vanderveken,"It's not the best example of seventies war movies, but it works",8,30 June 2005,"Partially thanks to my father I've always been a fan of war movies and that's how I already saw several of them as a kid. But of course as a kid I wasn't as critical towards them as I am today. Several of the war movies from the sixties and seventies now seem dated and very unbelievable (think for instance of ""Where Eagles Dare"" from 1968, which many people seem to like, but which lacks all realism as the Allies seem impenetrable by German bullets). But that doesn't mean that they all are bad. Take for instance ""Cross of Iron"", ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (the TV remake), ""A Bridge Too Far"",... which are one by one excellent movies. If I have to give this movie a place in between these two categories, than I would say right in the middle. It isn't the best war movie from that time period, but it's far from bad.Based on the novel by Jack Higgins, this movie tells the story of Colonel Steiner, a German parachute unit commander, who has been court-marshaled for opposing the SS in rounding up Jews. To avoid further imprisonment and certain death, he is offered the chance to go on an assignment in England. He and his unit will have to kidnap the British Prime Minister Winston Churchil on a covert mission. They decide to go for the seemingly impossible assignment and dressed as Polish soldiers on a training maneuver, they soon take over a small English town, waiting for the visit of the Prime Minister who will take his vacation there...Even though I have read the book, I'm not really able to tell you whether the adaption to the movie has been a success or not. I read the book about ten years ago and it's impossible for me to remember all the details. However, as I already said, this certainly isn't a bad movie. The acting for instance is very nice. People like Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Robert Duvall,... all did a nice job. Especially Donald Sutherland stole the show playing the IRA militant and full time playboy Liam Devlin. What I also liked was that the 'Germans' didn't speak with some funny accent, but spoke fluent English. I prefer to hear the Germans speak German, but when that it isn't possible, this option is the best to go for. There is nothing more hateful than a well-known Hollywood actor who tries to make you believe that he speaks a language other than English (it never works and only brings down the quality of a movie).Overall this is a good WWII movie that shows the war from a different perspective, namely from the German side. For some that will probably make it uninteresting as they see the Germans as the stupid bad guys, unable of doing some daring operations, but for me it works.

38,screenman,Adequate Vintage Hokum,7,9 June 2009,"This is one of those 'judgement suspension' movies like 'Where Eagles Dare' or 'Guns Of Navarone' in which a crack team set out to accomplish the seeming impossible. Except that as the team in this movie are Germans, unlike the Yanks or Brits - they fail.It's a convoluted 'Boys-Own' adventure that you must never, ever take seriously, just come along for the ride.Like the others, its got a stellar cast, complex sub-plots, and crap accents. The Germans are going to kidnap/assassinate Churchill. Like the much earlier 'Went The Day Well' they seem to have miraculously procured their own transport, with no explanation as to how. Maybe Jack Higgins tells us in his book. I haven't read it. Also like 'Went The Day Well' there is a resident traitor.This is a perfectly adequate little romp, directed in a rather straightforward, even laid-back, style by John Sturges. Michael Caine leads the German paratroopers disguised as Poles. Donald Sutherland is an Irish Quisling who has a curious way with animals - later inherited by Crocodile Dundee. Robert Duvall and almost inevitable Donald Pleasance represent the German High-Command. Jenny Agutter plays a tomboyish femme-fatale. There's a host of other familiars who pop-up as and when.It's never intended to be a serious slice of WW2, just a thorough-going goodie-versus-baddie, not-too-demanding adventure. Technical stuff is competent from a lighting, directing, editing, standpoint, as you'd expect from Sturges. The script won't set any pens ablaze. Escapism, plain and simple.My DVD cost 3 quid.

39,denis888,A Huge Disillusionment,2,6 January 2018,"I love old British WWII movies, as well as joint efforts like The Longest Day, or Battle For Britain, or the like. There were, however, hugely gross and awful movies like Patton or Bridge Over River Kwan, which, in fact, are shallow and misleading efforts. This one, made in 1976, seemed to be awesome, with a stellar cast, Michael Cain, Robert Duval or very young Donals Sutherland amonf those, so what could go wrong? Everything went wrong. Absolutely hilarious and totally unnecessary accents, very wrong character development, almost caricature-like portrayals of such figures as Himmler or Canaris, as well as totally wrong female casting choice - there are but the few errors of the film. Then, the plot seems to be just a total joke, and the delivery borders on the brink of fairy tale. And of course, the battle scenes - oh my, could we imagine anything less terrible? 
I was goggling in utter disbelief and in laughing mode - how could a war drama be shaped into a crass third-class comedic sketch of no merit? 
What is mostly awful is the fact that we feel no mercy or compassion to anyone, and then how can we do this to carboard cutout schematic cartoons?",The Eagle Has Landed

41,juliankennedy23,To the Moon Nazi.,5,24 October 2008,"The Eagle Has Landed 5/10: The Eagle Has Landed is one of those revisionist war films that were so popular after the Vietnam War.In this film the Nazis are the protagonists (though not necessarily the good guys). While the British are painted as morally equivalent (mention is made of the British concentration camps during the Second Boer war) and the United States forces are portrayed as untested buffoons (Two words; Larry Hagman; see below).The Eagle has Landed is about a Nazi plot to kidnap Winston Churchill and bring him back to Germany. An eye patched Robert Duvall plays the plan’s author and Donald Pleasence plays his ruthless boss Heinrich Himmler (great casting there). They recruit German airborne leader Michael Caine (Who was educated in England though how a German at Oxford picks up a Cockney accent is never explained.) Caine’s character is where the movie starts to float of the rails. Caine and his men are in a German prison camp because they tried to rescue a Jewish girl. This of course sets Caine up as the “good” Nazi. This honestly is as bad a copout as when Mel Gibson’s character in The Patriot was proffered as being the only plantation owner in the American south to use free blacks exclusively.If the movie wants us to root for the Nazi’s at least be honest about it. This unfortunate choice also gives a Dirty Dozen vibe to the film that it neither deserves nor can live up to.After Caine’s men land in Middle Earth (sorry a small English village) disguised as polish paratroopers (Insert obvious joke here) they quickly set up camp with the help of a local woman with a chip on her shoulder (Jean Marsh) and an IRA man played broadly by Donald Sutherland. The film quickly develops more subplots then its two and a half hour running time can comfortable handle.The silliest of these involves the romance between Sutherland’s romantic IRA gadfly and a local village girl played by a disappointing clothed Jenny Agutter. They have one slight meet cute date at the beach and based on a chaste peck and some poetry (not to mention the promises of an Irishman); Agutter’s character shoots her other suitor with a shotgun, covers for the Nazis (including working their radio) and needless to say runs away with her charming murdering rogue.Pile on the Germans demanding the right to wear their Nazi uniforms under their disguises (Yeah that’s a foolproof idea. No possible downside there); Sutherland’s spy character not noting the large American ranger base just up the road; and the fact that the village itself is not suspicious of an Irishman who seemed to just drop out of the sky. (Literally) After this entire dimwitted English shire consists of about 12 people, a waterwheel and a Catholic church. (Not Anglican???) Why Churchill would ever visit such a hamlet in the first place is never explained.And then there are the American Rangers. I’ve heard Larry Hagman was a good actor on occasion (I’m not about to sit through Fail Safe anytime soon to find out) but in this film he is unfunny broad comic relief. While up to this point all the actors have done a great job with sometimes poorly written roles (I’m giving Agutter a pass on this one) and have really helped to keep the movie together; Hagman’s comic relief guy simply kills any serious mood the movie had created up to this point. It’s overacting scene-chewing buffoonery that has to be seen to be believed.The other major American role is played by Treat Williams. Yeah enough said.Last nail in an otherwise attractive coffin are the action scenes themselves. Maybe I play to much Call of Duty but have any of these guys ever heard of covering fire or squad tactics? Another reviewer compared it to the A-team and I concur. The action scenes seem simply sloppy and the movie piddles out into a trick ending.Had they played it straight throughout and allowed the characters to act like real people this could have been a great movie. They certainly had the budget and the cast to do a great film. They simply didn’t have the confidence in the material to let the chips fall where they may.",The Eagle Has Landed
42,timdalton007,Get Churchill,8,24 April 2013,"Based on Jack Higgins' bestselling 1975 novel, The Eagle Has Landed can be summed up rather easily. The year is 1943: World War II rages in Europe and, following the rescue by German commandos of defeated Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Hitler orders the kidnapping of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Though not a serious suggestion, events quickly lead to a group of German paratroopers being sent into a quiet English village on a mission that could change the course of the war. The film features a strong cast. There is Michael Caine as the German paratrooper officer Kurt Steiner which Caine fills rather admirably and, even without a German accent, believably as a leader. Donald Sutherland as IRA turned German agent Liam Devlin manages to bring a lot of charm and humor to his rather duplicitous role, despite an at times shaky accent. There's also Robert Duvall as Colonel Radl, the mastermind behind the operation, which Duvall plays a rather subdued but intriguing character. The supporting cast ranges from Jenny Agutter as village girl Molly Prior, Jean Marsh as villager Joanna Gray, John Standing as the village vicar to Sven-Bertil Taube as Steiner's second in command. The film also features the clichéd and over the top character of the American Ranger Colonel Pitts played by Larry Hagman in a performance that is nothing short of cringe worthy. More successful as both a character and a performance is his underling Captain Clark played by a young Treat Williams. Last but not least is Donald Pleasence who makes a couple of brief appearance as Heinrich Himmler, working an oddly menacing quality over the real life Nazi leader. The result is a well-acted film for the most part.The production values of the film are strong as well for the most part. There's some good recreations of the World War II settings ranging from German military offices to the English village where the bulk of the film's back half takes place (though as noted elsewhere there are goofs). The film's action sequences are well staged and feature some strong stunt work as well. In particular, the parachuting sequence and the initial battle in the village work splendidly. That said the film's pace is rather pedestrian at times, due to almost uninterested direction from John Sturges (this was to be his last film and it has been reported that Sturges took the film on mainly for money and walked out on the post production entirely). What keeps the film moving during those times is the score from Lalo Schifrin which suits the film's various settings and events admirably. The film's script and plot, adapted from the Higgins' bestseller as mentioned earlier, also works well. Like Fredrick Forsyth's The Day Of The Jackal (and its' own excellent film adaptation), the film works despite the fact that we clearly know that German paratroopers didn't manage to kidnap Winston Churchill in the middle of World War II. The film, as with the source material, instead works through the sheer power of its ""what it?"" premise by taking the audience along throughout the entire mission from its planning to the recruitment of Steiner and his men through the mission right up to the finale. The script by Tom Mankiewicz follows the Higgins' novel quite closely though it does jettison a few characters and plot points (including a member of S.S. British Free Corps sent in with the paratroopers for example) but the result is a by and large faithful presentation of the novel for the screen. Despite uninterested direction and a sometimes pedestrian pace, The Eagle Has Landed stands up well after more than thirty-five years. That is in large part thanks to a strong cast, good production values and action sequences. Above all though, it may well be down to the power of the Mankiewicz adaptation of Jack Higgins' original novel and the strength of its premise. The film then stands up as a good example of the World War II action/thriller, pure and simple.",The Eagle Has Landed
43,edgeofreality,More please,10,30 August 2020,Truly enjoyable Nazi shenanigans Hollywood style. I was rooting for them to get Churchill all the way. Larry Hangman stands out as a wannabe hero.

44,random_avenger,The Eagle Has Landed,6,9 September 2010,"John Sturges' World War II adventure hit of the 1970s still works somewhat decently within its genre. The story deals with a group of German soldiers who are sent on a nearly impossible mission of kidnapping Winston Churchill when he comes to visit a rural English village. Compiled by a frustrated Colonel Radl (Robert Duvall), the team consists of a Britain-hating Irish militant Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland) and the loyal men of a righteous hero soldier Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine) who has been dishonoured and imprisoned for his lack of respect for his superiors. Devlin is sent to infiltrate the coastal village of Studley Constable and to contact a German sleeper agent Joanna Grey (Jean Marsh) in advance, while Steiner prepares his troops to pose as friendly Polish soldiers and arrives in Britain later. Having reached the village, the team finds a settlement of American soldiers nearby and as expected, things don't go neatly according to the plans.The movie doesn't go for an analytical meditation on the nature of war and focuses on the personal level instead. The tone stays somewhat light for the most part and especially Devlin's antics while getting to know the English locals, such as Molly and Arthur (Jenny Agutter and Terry Plummer), approach comedy at points. The pacing is very leisurely: action scenes are only seen during the last third of the runtime and while they are entertaining enough for what it's worth, they are not spectacular enough to carry the whole story alone. Even though we know from history if the team's mission will be successful or not, there is a small twist at the end that adds a sense of sadness to the mood – the message about the futility of war efforts from a grunt's point of view culminate in Steiner's final scene somewhat effectively, even if the big payoff doesn't ultimately feel quite worth the wait.The emphasis being on the characters' on-screen chemistry, the importance of the actors becomes even bigger than usual. Luckily, most of the cast does a good job throughout. Particularly the always creepy-looking Donald Sutherland suits his role formidably, conveying a feel of joviality and menace at the same time. The quiet and mousy Himmler is also portrayed with natural ease by Donald Pleasence and the calm Robert Duvall is at home as the eyepatch-wearing Radl. Larry Hagman's role as the American Colonel Pitts brings humour to the mix while avoiding overly annoying bumbling. The only complaint I have is that it is difficult to see Michael Caine as a German officer, even if his character is explained to have studied in England – Caine is such an archetype of Britishness that a German uniform is not enough to make his legendary persona disappear.In addition to the performances, some of the scenery of the windy beaches and the surrounding areas look very nice and Lalo Schifrin's score fits in with the mood well. However, tighter pacing and writing would have been needed to raise The Eagle Has Landed to the master class. As it is now, it is a watchable war flick but not among the best of its ilk. Fans of the stars should find it enjoyable though.",The Eagle Has Landed

Dialogs are really more in some Western, Cowboy movie style. Michael Kaine, Donald Sutherland characters especially.
Direction is uneven. Some parts done well, some poorly, especially fight scenes in small town.
I really have no clue how much of all it is based on real events, but overall most of actions, talk was not realistic for WWII .

46,aramis-112-804880,Sent Me Back to the Book,6,12 July 2014,"Watch out for spoilers: It's a cliché to say ""the book is better."" Some books are, since they have more depth of character. This is not, however, universal. Many screenplays, for obvious reasons, streamline novels, cutting out extraneous characters and making the stories flow much more smoothly. I can point out lots of cases where the movie actually is better.Not here. ""The Eagle Has Landed"" does streamline the story, naturally. The entire Preston subplot is excised. So is a lot of the back-and-forth yo-yoing of Radl to Himmler. In fact, Canaris has so little to do in this flick, I'm surprised they left him in at all. (Anthony Quayle is wasted as Canaris; Donald Pleasence has a field day as Himmler, and he lets us know what Hamlet means when he says one can smile and be a villain).On the plus side, the screenplay telescopes the story nicely. The novel takes place over months, while the screenplay seems to cover just a few days.Michael Caine is perfect as the German soldier with a conscience, while playing his cards close to his chest. Donald Sutherland is fine as the wry Devlin (replacing Richard Harris, and it's too bad we missed that performance). Larry Hagman, never the world's greatest actor, plays a character who was an idiot in the book and manages to be even more stupid in the movie (so although he did the part well enough as written, he can't help coming off looking unpleasantly like a buffoon; I'm surprised they didn't hire a comedic actor to play the part). I've never been a fan of Jean Marsh so I'm happy with her performance as the faux-British traitor. Jenny Agutter is pertly pretty; that's all that is required of her and that's all she does.But when all the shooting is over, one has never really connected to the characters. In the book one is surprisingly drawn to the IRA assassin and all the men fighting for their German fatherland (or, in Steiner's case, his real father, who is in Himmler's clutches). Confronted, in the movie, with dumb Americans and Brits, angry churchmen, supposedly compassionate characters studded over with Nazi regalia, and a moonstruck girl who shoots an unwelcome suitor in the back with both barrels to keep him from betraying her hit-man lover, there is really no one here for the film-goer to sympathize with.This is where the book's depth of character makes it superior. In the book you even feel disappointed when the Nazis lose, which shows the author's mastery. In many ways the screenplay and the editing improve on the story. But overall, once the shooting starts it's a bore, when that should be the exciting part.",The Eagle Has Landed

Accuracy is beside the point. Of course it never happened nor was it likely to occur. Having the Germans portrayed like something else than simply ""the Hun"" was the point and, in a way, this turns out to be an anti-war film, showing us how good men are wasted for nothing.We feel for these German soldiers and they are not just like the criminals portrayed in, for instance, Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13, an anonymous clumsy but nevertheless threatening bunch. Compare this film with Where Eagles Dare and you get my point. If the Germans were as stupid as in that film they would not have lasted for 6 years and more likely for only 6 minutes.Again, what you are left with after seeing this film, is that war, all wars, are wrong and that those who die in them are probably the best of us.",The Eagle Has Landed

51,tnrcooper,"Enjoyable, fairly well-made WWII film",8,16 August 2008,"""The Eagle Has Landed"" is a World War II film directed by John Sturges, the legendary director who also helmed ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"". This was his last film and features some fantastic performances; Treat Williams is very good as Capt. Clark, an American soldier who, to his everlasting credit conducts military actions according to the military's books. Michael Caine is very very good as a conflicted German officer who disagrees with the policy of exterminating Jews. He conveys the man's decency and a sense of frustration, but also devotion to his position as an officer which makes for a nuanced depiction of a fairly decent human being. I thought the part of Devlin, the IRA member who offers the German's the contact they need to occupy the small village from which they plan on assassinating Churchill, was a bit clownish. That said, Donald Sutherland plays the part well. The sub-plot of his romance with Molly (Jenny Agutter) was a bit unnecessary and to suggest that women wouldn't necessarily be interested in a war film without a ""romantic"" sub-plot is a little insulting to women. One commenter suggested the sub-plot was there for that reason. In any case, the romance seemed superfluous and extremely improbable. Robert Duvall is very good as Col. Hadl who conceives of the plot to assassinate Churchill. He is cool and calculating while not seeming inhuman. Mention must also be made of Donald Pleasence, giving a fittingly chilling depiction of Heinrich Himmler.As mentioned by many other commenters, it is obviously good to see German soldiers not portrayed as child-digesting, mother-rapists. Yes, many of them did terrible things during WWII, as did soldiers from all countries. And this is not to excuse poor behavior, but as with soldiers from any country, their motivation is loyalty to their country, something which seems not to have crossed the mind of Richard B. Cheney regarding Iraq. It doesn't matter how bad your leader is, the pull of responding and working on behalf of your country is strong, regardless of the reasons for the war. I found the use of Larry Hagman as a frustrated, war- craving Col. Pitts silly. While there may have been soldiers who jonesed for the heat of battle, the drawing of the character seems overly broad and, given the limited depiction of American troops in the film, rather insulting to the generally representative manner in which US troops conducted themselves during the war. Perhaps Sturges, in depicting the German troops generally humanely, and one US soldier as craven, was playing with notions of behavior by troops on different sides of battle during war, but I thought that Col. Pitts' part in general was somewhat insulting to US troops. Jean Marsh is very good as an ice cold Nazi sympathizer who helps facilitate the activity against Mr. Churchill. The directing and the cinematography are competent. I enjoyed the unexpected conclusion to the film and thought that it was an interesting narrative choice. Obviously it was based on the book which I have not read, but nevertheless, I found it an interesting touch. I found this a diverting, if not earth-shattering World War II pic. It's worth your time.",The Eagle Has Landed
52,canuckteach,Great Novel - well-acted adaptation...,8,21 December 2009,"A German Paratroop officer (Steiner, played by a suave Michael Caine), a war hero, runs afoul of the S.S. and is given a court-martial, more or less a death-sentence for him, and the soldiers under his command. It happens that he is British-educated, and would be useful to the German Military: they have concocted a secret mission to have a team of commandos inserted into a remote British coastal village to kidnap Churchill. The S.S., under H. Himmler himself, take a hand in 'overseeing' the wild plot, for reasons that become evident later on.Thus begins the film adaptation of Jack Higgins' greatest novel. There is excellent acting from a variety of 'name players' doing limited roles, such as Anthony Quayle, Robert Duvall, Treat Williams and Donald Sutherland. Donald Pleasence turns in an eerie, chilling portrayal of Himmler, showing the excellent range of a fine actor (who, for instance, portrayed an amiable, meek and mild forger in 'Great Escape').You do 'get the picture' that German soldiers also suffered under the Nazi regime, and the rank-and-file soldiers were not in league with fanatical Nazi aims. (The recent movie 'Valkyrie' with Tom Cruise portrayed that the German military command long sought to get rid of Hitler, especially after the Normandy invasion in June/1944. One of Hitler's greatest opponents - secretly, of course - was Admiral Canaris, played well in this film by Anthony Quayle).There are lots of well-choreographed shoot-em-up scenes, leading to a gripping conclusion. It is a guy-film - not a 'date' flick! 8/10*spoilers* (partial) from the book: the father of Steiner (Michael Caine) is also German military, but was under S. S. imprisonment at the order of Himmler, to induce Steiner to complete his mission, and not capitulate to the British (this answers a question posted here at IMDb)..the German commando squad included a 'British Freecorps' thug - this was a British citizen who joined the German S.S. to fight the Russians, claiming anti-Communist sentiments.

Many reviewers have pointed out other ludicrous aspects.The early part of the film also goes way over the top in its laboured efforts to show us that Michael Caine and co are non-Nazi, honourable Germans. (In the event, so honourable that Caine is prepared to shoot Churchill in cold blood, even though he realises that Hitler's regime is evil and the war is lost.) How assassinating Churchill is meant to help matters is more than obscure.

56,Deusvolt,"A realistic war movie in the sense that it shows that the combatants can not easily be pigeonholed as ""good"" or ""bad.""",8,3 March 2005,"The Germans were the bad guys in WWII right? But Oberst Steiner is an officer in the paratroopers, one with a conscience in the sense that he tried to save a Jewish woman from the SS. The British were with the Allies. So they were good guys, right? But they had Ireland under their boot where the Irish Catholics were denied basic human rights like the right to own land, government employment, etc. (Read Leon Uris' Trinity). So was Devlin (played by Donald Sutherland), the IRA operative, a bad guy for helping the Germans in their operation to kidnap Churchill? Also, the German commandos were prematurely revealed to the townspeople because one of them saved a child from being crushed by a water wheel when she fell into a stream. The German uniform he wore under his Polish soldier disguise showed as he lay dead spreadeagled on the water wheel. That's what makes this film meaningful and important. Sure, there are flaws but the acting by Caine, Pleasance and Duvall make up for them.Sven Bertil Taube, the actor who portrayed Col.Steiner's (Caine) second in command, Hauptmann Von Neustadt had a touching dialog with his Herr Oberst. SPOILER: The plot was blown and Steiner's commandos offered to stay in the church where they were holed up to give covering fire and serve as a diversion as Steiner tries to complete the mission in the face of a sweeping up operation by American troops.

Not great, but not bad.The acting by Duvall, Caine, and Sutherland are what you'd expect from these excellent actors.The scenery, sets, etc. Are well done, though nothing special.Unfortunately, while the story has an interesting premise, it's execution is on the boring side.The film feels like the only thing holding it together are the actors (sans the crappy German accents).The story is somewhat choppy, disjointed, but that would be OK were it not for the rather thin story.It's not bad for an a lazy-day time filler. It's not a good choice if it's the evening's entertainment.Frankly, it was often a bit too predictable as well.Rating: A generous 7.",The Eagle Has Landed
58,Ajtlawyer,not worth the time,4,18 October 2004,"Having just read Michael Caine's autobiography I was anxious to see some of his older movies. I must say that I was sorely disappointed by ""The Eagle Has Landed"" SPOILERS ALERT.First, the title. I know it must be based on a book but after 1969 virtually anyone who knows history would associate ""The Eagle Has Landed"" with the Apollo 11 moon landing. Why have this as a title for a WWII movie?Second, any movie which focuses on the Germans in WWII for its story is going to have a hard time getting the audience to pull and root for the main characters. Who wants the Nazis to succeed? No one, of course, so why should we interested in watching a story told from the German side?Third, no one seems to keep his accent in this movie. Robert Duvall is a German officer but his German accent is barely noticeable. This is a movie that Duvall made after both of the ""The Godfather"" movies; I can't believe he decided to take a secondary role in this movie. Michael Caine doesn't even seem to try and affect a German accent. In fact his character, Col. Steiner, is said to have studied in England so I guess that was a way for his character to avoid trying to sound like a German. Of course Steiner goes to England posing as a Polish paratrooper (no jokes, please) and he doesn't attempt any Polish accent, either. Although a couple of his fellow commandos do it easily and seem to be able to speak Polish fluently. Lastly on accents, Donald Sutherland is trying to do an Irish accent and he at least is able to keep his brogue throughout the movie.Fourth, why is Sutherland trying to help the Germans anyway? He is Devlin, an Irish nationalist who is so hell bent on a unified Ireland that he's thrown in with the Nazis. But by the time he's recruited for the mission (to kidnap Churchill) even Duvall's character has conceded that the war has been lost, and it is only 1943! If the Irish really wanted to assassinate Churchill they'd hardly need German help since Irishmen are all over England.Fifth, the first part of the movie is entirely too long. It is used to try and establish I guess that Caine (Steiner) and his commandos are supposed to be the best soldiers in Germany but that they also aren't sympathetic to the Nazi cause. For that they're jailed. Then in a sort of German version of ""The Dirty Dozen"" Steiner and his men are offered a chance at freedom and reinstatement in the German Army if they will try and pull off this fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants mission to kidnap Churchill. Sixth, Sutherland (Devlin) is dropped in a couple of days before the Germans in order to be a pathfinder I guess. He's supposed to be a ""marsh warden"" which I guess is something of a park ranger and everyone in the town seems to accept him in that role even though he's only been there a day or so. No suspicion on their part of an Irishman just showing up.Seventh, Jenny Agutter, the ingenue for the movie, almost immediately falls in love with Devlin and even says she's in love with him, but having barely known him for more than 48 hrs. She's so much in love with him she murders his romantic rival after the rival discovers that Devlin is a Nazi agent of some sort. Even when Devlin confirms that he's working for the Nazis, Agutter still is loyal to him!Eighth, some woman in the town is a Fifth Columnist for the Nazis but why she is working for them, who knows?Ninth, very quickly the Germans' cover as Polish paratroopers is blown and they take the town hostage and are in a stand-off with a bunch of US Army Rangers led by a blow-hard National Guard colonel, Larry Hagman. You'd think you'd be waiting for a big battle sequence but no, the ""battle"" consists of an ambush by the Germans and then the Americans massacring the Germans who decide to die with their boots on, providing cover for Steiner and Devlin as they escape and try to continue on with the mission. You'd think that, knowing the war is lost anyway, they would've taken the chance to just surrender and sit the war out in a comfortable Allied POW camp.Tenth, although the Americans seemingly have surrounded the town, Steiner and Devlin escape through an amazing, ancient tunnel that is in the church and which almost takes them out of town! Boy, was that a lucky break! Eleventh, realizing that Steiner hasn't given up trying to kill Churchill, the Americans and British take Churchill to a place that is secure (why not get him the hell into his limo and take him back to London?). Steiner of course easily infiltrates the place and kills Churchill only to be gunned down the the Americans. Steiner dies believing he's killed Churchill but, wait a minute, it is Churchill's double! (an aside, the actor really does look like Churchill). The real Churchill is at the famous Tehran conference being held with FDR and Stalin. Now you would've thought that German military intelligence would've known about the Tehran Conference and realized that the real Churchill would be going to that meeting, not going to a vacation at some British coastal town. In all, ""The Eagle Has Landed"" is a big disappointment. John Sturges, the director, had made ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"" and it is very sad that he pretty much ended a distinguished career with this sort of drivel.",The Eagle Has Landed
59,RMurray847,"Good, solid, old-fashioned war thriller. Lots of fun.",7,5 April 2021,"This film came out in late 1976, basically the day before I turned 13. My dad was a big Jack Higgins fan (the author of the book), and so we would have seen this movie early in its run. I loved it as a kid, and saw it a decade or so later on a rented VHS. So when I watched the blu ray just the other day, it had been roughly 35 years.But I remembered significant swaths of this film, and it was a great viewing experience. I remembered enough to get that bit of nostalgia fix, but had forgotten enough details to still have some sense of discovery. The blu ray looks and sounds great! There are a couple of blurry shots fairly early on, but otherwise, this movie hasn't looked better since it came out in theaters.A brief summary: in the waning days of WWII, a random remark by Hitler sparks a daring plan. To kidnap Winston Churchill and bring him to Germany. Under secret orders from Heinrich Himmler (the always fun Donald Pleasance), colonel Robert Duvall develops a plan to carry this off. Using an annoying Irish spy (Donald Sutherland) who is eager to strike a blow against the Brits and a paratrooper unit led by Michael Caine...the Germans disguise themselves and land in a small village in Britain where Churchill is planning to visit. That's all I'll say, except to note that plenty of twists and turns abound.It's somewhat daring for the fact that we cannot help but root for Caine and company to succeed. We meet Caine early on, and see that he and his men are soldiers with some honor amidst the darker proceedings in Germany. When battle scenes are waged later in the film, the viewer's loyalties may be torn.This is an old-fashioned movie in many ways. Yes, it's nearly 50 years old now, but beyond that, it's directed with solid craftsmanship by John Sturges (THE GREAT ESCAPE, a Top 10 all-time for me). It lets it's meaty plot and great cast just run with things. Unfussy. But also with a big, bombastic score and some sweeping establishing shots that you just don't get anymore. The plot is all, really, and the actors inhabit their characters in ways that keep loyalties easy to understand, intentions clear and the beats of the plot well covered. Although several surprising events happen, we never feel they are cheats or unearned.Michael Caine is great here. This is mid-career Caine at its most solid. It's a no-nonsense film and he gives it a no-nonsense performance. We see his determination, honor and dignity. He's a ""good guy"" even if he's on the wrong side. Robert Duvall, in a thankless role, really, because he's left behind in German and doesn't get to have any ""fun"", is solid and convincing. Jenny Agutter appears in a key role (I won't say more) and I had a pang of regret that for so many years, her career fizzled. She is a strong and likeable presence. Donald Sutherland is smarmy and snarky, with a slightly over-baked Irish accent, but he is the film's comic relief to a large extent. Well, except for the small but absolutely hilarious turn from Larry Hagman as an unskilled officer, who charges into the fray with no plan or forethought. I remembered enjoying his nutso performance decades ago, and it holds up very well. His character, it could be argued, really belongs in a different movie...but he's so darn enjoyable! Only Treat Williams fails to create any spark in his performance. Everyone else feels free to chew the scenery just a little bit, and Williams apparently didn't care to join in.The action sequences, though tame by today's standards, are still reasonably exciting. Overall, this is just a good, solid, entertaining film. I imagine it would put younger viewers (like under 40) to sleep; but I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to a different era of filmmaking.",The Eagle Has Landed
60,nzpedals,synchronicity it is said!,8,22 January 2017,"The guy with the eye patch quotes Jung (I think), about the way fate sometimes delivers just the thing we really really want!The movie starts with news clips showing the daring rescue of Mussolini and tells us that Hitler gets the idea of doing the same to Churchill. Of course, we know that didn't happen, so why bother watching all the rest of it? Coz we also know that Higgins can write action-packed thrillers (Was this really his first book?)Having got the basic idea, the Germans set out to do a feasibility study and they have the ideal guy to do it for them, Steiner (Caine) and his band of paratroopers. Conveniently, they have captured an intact MTB AND a C47 plane.Their plan is to pretend to be from the Polish Free Force, but they wear their German uniforms underneath so that if (when) they are caught, they won't be summarily executed as spies.Right on very early on, the movie has the feel of a Higgins super- thriller and so I watch, wondering... how is it going to end? Other reviews will tell you if you don't want to watch it. There are a couple of silly scenes, the instant ""love"" between Molly and Devlin - nah, and the silly vicar, but apart from that it is all ""GO"".Treat Williams an American who replaces Larry Hagman's character is the best of the support cast, and he gets a great line..

63,thegulls1,Great cast for this classic Jack Higgins yarn...,8,7 June 2018,"I read Jack Higgin' novel before watching the movie and thoroughly enjoyed this presentation. The character of Liam Devlin, a tough Irish nationalist, (played beautifully here by a 'young' Donald Sutherland), was one Higgins re-used effectively in a few novels. In this story, a mission to kidnap Winston Churchill is hatched by the German High Command. The specific plot, a pipe dream of Himmler and Hitler, is concocted by Col. Radl, played skilfully by Robert Duvall, as always. He recruits a team of crack German commandos led by Michael Caine's Kurt Steiner. He and his team have fallen into disfavour, explaining why they accept such a wild, suicide venture.  Nonetheless, Radl plants Devlin in Northern England in the fictional town of Studley Constable, where a disillusioned female Boer descendant has indicated the PM will arrive for dinner, cigars and brandy. Intelligence? Check. Team of Kidnappers disguised as Polish Nationals? Check. Means of escape I.e. a Brit- looking patrol boat? Check. What could go wrong?  Superb performances by a great cast. Just one change from the book that may cheer you up: Steiner & his men are condemned because they interfere with an S.S. operation to load Jewish captives onto a train headed to a Death Camp. The Jewish girl they load onto a different train gets shot anyway-in the book, she gets away Scot-free! Ponder that as you see how this one finally turns out.",The Eagle Has Landed

Also brilliant are Jean Marsh, Treat Williams, Donald Sutherland and Robert Duval. Duval's character has cancer and winces as he walks in several scenes. Clearly he is clearly method acting the pain in his pauses.To those who have lambasted Larry Hagman's acting as Colonel Pitts - well I can say I have met officers this stupid in the army, and after seeing David Schwimmer's character, who was based on real life, in 'Band of Brothers' it appears idiots of this calibre really did get to battalion rank in the US Army in WW2.

66,jubilee77,Not good,1,3 August 2011,"There looks to be something promising about World War II films and children use to read about military heroes in Victor comic books of the bygone era. With movies featuring WWII epics going back to the 1940s (even when the war was still ongoing), the late 1960s saw them slip into gradual decline. By the 1970s, the decline escalated that some some films like Force 10 from Navarone or Escape from Athenia made towards the end of that decade have proved to be unsuccessful in the box office. In the case of The Eagle Has landed, this film surprisingly has managed a narrow escape from the flop lists.
If some WW11 films have proved to be totally far-fetched and not history then The Eagle Has Landed must be around the top of the lists as it's about a Nazi conspiracy to kidnap the British prime minister. Chamberlain whom declared war on Germany died in the early stages having resigned from office two months previously due to terminal ill health and was succeeded by Churchill. The film was supposed to be based on the acclaimed novel by Jack Higgins but the film version was totally re-written by Tom Markiewicz. I do recall watching it for the first time in the early 1980s after being promised a good film about the Germans hatching a plan to kidnap a prime minister but while settling down with my father, he described it as ""stupid"".
The film is generally dull and the techniques and acting in some parts is very poor. In one scene, the small girl whom was supposed to have a fallen into the mill's waterway by accident clearly reveals her sitting on the wall for the film set-up and then she either jumped or let-go. Michael Caine's Oberst Kurt Steiner might look convincing but the rest of his Nazi co-conspirators are ridiculous and Donald Sutherland as an Irish thug Liam Devlin is very poor and most disliked he coaxes a would-be-traitorous girl call Molly played by Jennifer Agutter. On this movie in wartime England, it appears that some parts of the areas were patroled by a network of bungling USA forces headed by Larry Hagman's Colonel Pitt. Later, he meets his end by falling down the stairs after being shot by a Nazi agent called Joanna Grey played by Jean Marsh and then she in turn, meets her own fate. There are also other action set-ups in evidence like a Jeep looking like as if it was deliberately driven into a river but there's a similar set-up scene with a Churchill double meeting his end thanks to a security blunder, Steiner's change of plan shoots him dead.
It was the last film to be directed by John Sturges but Sturges' departure was not without controversy as Michael Caine outlined in his autobiography. Tom Markiewicz thought the script was the best he had written but Sturges did a poor job and had given up. Caine recalled that Sturges told him he only worked to earn enough money to go fishing and added that the moment the picture finished he took the money and went. Producer Jack Wiener later commented that Sturges never came back for the editing nor for any of the other good post-production sessions that are where a director does some of his most important work. Caine also wrote that ""the picture wasn't bad but I still get angry when I think of what it could have been with the right director. We had committed the old European sin of being impressed by someone just because he came from Hollywood"".",The Eagle Has Landed

70,KEVMC,Enjoyable adaptation of Jack Higgins' novel.,8,20 September 2003,"After the successful rescue of Mussolini by German Paratroopers, Col.Max Radl is asked to prepare a feasibility study on an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill. At first this seems a preposterous idea, until a message arrives from an agent in Britain which reports that Churchill will spend a weekend in the picturesque Norfolk village of Studley Constable, which is only a few miles from a deserted stretch of coastline. A plan is formulated to drop Col.Kurt Steiner and his highly experienced unit into Norfolk to carry out the mission, aided by IRA man Liam Devlin and respected local figure Joanna Grey, who is a German agent and the source of the original message.   This film has been a personal favourite of mine since I first saw it on its TV premiere around 1979, aged 12. It is of course the screen adaptation of Jack Higgins bestseller. I must admit to never having read the book, so I can't testify how closely the film follows it. Produced by ITC in 1976, it boasts an impressive cast in Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Robert Duvall, Donald Pleasance and a pre-JR Larry Hagman. Veteran Hollywood Director John Sturges was at the helm - the man responsible for 'Bad Day At Black Rock', 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'The Great Escape' to name just three. The production values and technical credits are uniformally good.   As to the film itself, it remains an entertaining romp. Your interest is held throughout, and you find yourself half wanting the Germans to get away with it, as Michael Caine and his men are such decent chaps. Donald Sutherland is full of Irish charm as Devlin, Larry Hagman is intentionally funny as the incompetent Col.Clarence T.Pitts, Robert Duvall is convincing and sympathetic as Radl, and Donald Pleasance quite chilling as Himmler. Good though the film is, it might have been better. In his autobiography, Michael Caine talks about the fact that after shooting had wrapped, Sturges headed back to California and never returned for any of the editing or post production. Caine felt let down by this, for as he correctly states, a Director can do some of his most important work at this stage. However, he also remembers the shooting of the film as a very pleasurable experience. At that time he lived at Windsor, and much of the filming was done nearby on the beautiful Mapledurham Estate, during the longest, hottest summer that most of us remember.   I paid a visit to Mapledurham recently, during the fine summer that we've just enjoyed. It's instantly recognisible - the watermill, the church, the manor house, Joanna Grey's cottage - all as they appear in the film and well worth a visit. It always amuses me that the events are supposed to take place in November - a truly miserable month here - and yet its clearly mid-summer on screen.   I have one major gripe. Not with the film itself, but its availability on DVD. The UK version is to be avoided like the plague. Cursed with being distributed here by Carlton, its in 1.33:1 and worse is missing some 12 minutes of footage. The US version is at least in 2.35:1, but is still missing 3 to 4 minutes of the film. Thank heavens that I still have my complete version recorded from the BBC some 12 years ago, before they decided to cut some brief moments of violence. Its really annoying when a good film that did reasonable business at the box office gets such shoddy treatment on DVD. There really is no excuse for it.   When all is said and done, this is a good entertaining yarn and an intriguing idea (even if it does have echoes of 'Went The Day Well'). Maybe not a classic, but always good fun, professionally mounted and with some lovely locations. Give it a try if you haven't already seen it, just avoid that Region 2 DVD!",The Eagle Has Landed

74,thatchermacdonald,An atypical war movie with a great cast,9,27 February 2017,"What makes THE EAGLE HAS LANDED special to me is its slight deviation from traditional metrics and the unique feeling I receive when watching this film as a result. The first 35 or so years following the end of WWII saw many movies inspired by the events and or battles that took place in the European theater of war, and most of these flicks conform to traditional depictions of the Allies fighting the Nazis-- usually either a small Allied commando team on a fictitious mission to search and destroy Nazi targets, i.e. The Guns of Navarone, The Dirty Dozen, Where Eagles Dare, Force 10 From Navarone, etc. or cinematic interpretations inspired by actual events i.e. The Great Escape, Patton, Battle of the Bulge, To Hell and Back, A Bridge Too Far, etc.Based on the fictional novel written by Jack Higgins, THE EAGLE HAS LANDED takes a unique spin on the former through its portrayal of a Nazi commando unit dispatched to eliminate an Allied target. Because of this, several unique elements rise to the surface-- First, the unique setting in the English countryside rather than traditional European theater of operations in France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, and Germany. This provides a rather peaceful undertone to the movie as opposed to more traditional worn-torn areas portrayed in other WWII European theater war films. This creates a nice contrast during fight scenes and provides the viewer with a false sense of security.Second and most notably, this film actually makes me cheer for the traditional ""bad guys"" (to a certain extent), which is very unique in a Hollywood genre and period in which protagonist Allied characters are always supposed to be victorious, right? Okay, so the unique setting and antagonists make this movie special to me and sets it aside from other war films as previously mentioned, but third, the CAST is phenomenal-- Robert Duvall portraying a ""Stauffenberg-type"" Nazi officer, Donald Pleasence playing an impeccable 'Himmler', Donald Sutherland's character providing the laughs and light undertones, and of course Michael Caine at his best. These actors endear me to the film and provide enough sophistication to diminish less impressive performances seen at various points during the movie. Let's not forget Treat Williams ('Captain Clark') and John Standing ('Father Verecker'), as they execute their character's roles in the film wonderfully as well.This movie does have its slow points early on, but that is to be expected in a 2h 15min film in 1976. The movie also seems to lack a certain production quality if one decides to compare it to the following year's film, A Bridge Too Far, and two years later, Force 10 From Navarone, but this should not be a surprise nor a knock on the movie. All in all, this is a nice, feel-good WWII war movie with a unique, riveting plot and a solid cast.",The Eagle Has Landed

76,JoanWaterfield,Ruptured Duck,3,14 May 2020,"The trouble with 'The Eagle Has Landed' comes if you have read the book.
Jack Higgins came up with a cracker-jack thriller which, even knowing that the mad directive from Hitler to kidnap Churchill would not succeed, offered suspense and interest to the last page.
Thus primed, it could be anticipated that a particularly well-cast film would offer at least high-class melodrama. Well, all the ingredients are here, but Eagle comes across more like a ruptured duck than the high flying thriller it could have been.
Certainly the book took time to learn the characters and this gradual build-up of interest allowed the reader a nagging involvment as to who would survive and a sympathy with those on both sides of the plot.
The film adaptation has turned character into cliche and we are all left wondering why these excellent actors are in this film and what are we doing paying good money to watch them.
Donald Sutherland is totally charmless as the Irishman whose co-operation with Germany is supposed to be a blow in the cause of a free Ireland. And neither his bog-Irish accent nor his convoluted thinking can, in this script, justify the ready seduction of Jenny Agutter. Michael Caine as the highly honorable German officer offers a clipped parody of all those gallant British types who fought and flew in films of the 1940's.
There's Donald Pleasance as a photo-copy of Himmler and Anthony Quale popping in as Admiral Canaris. And Larry Hagman almost laughable as a paranoic American commander. Only that excellent actor Robert Duvall manages to holsd sympathy and interest.
But what ever happened to the Lord Haw-Haw type who was so much part of the book, the parish priest, his charming sister? all lost..which should be the fate of this movie.",The Eagle Has Landed
77,ian-262,Good portrayal of the Germans as soldiers,7,1 July 2005,"Enjoyable movie with some contrived plot devices, but that's common in fiction.I particularly liked that the German soldiers were portrayed as real people not faceless monsters, since the average German soldier was just an ordinary person with a life and family, not a deranged, homicidal fanatic. It is a common saying that people who kill each other in war could have been friends under other circumstances; particularly true when you're dealing with conscripts.Not unexpectedly Steiner and his men choose what they consider the honourable path, they fight knowing they will die. Steiner appears as if he might have an aristocratic background and his men are completely loyal so they automatically follow him.It is not really surprising that the Germans are quickly completely overwhelmed - they might be proficient commandos, but they are out-gunned and outnumbered. It is however a little implausible that they did not act a little more intelligently because such commandos could easily have killed quite a few more of the American soldiers before they were killed themselves.",The Eagle Has Landed

79,jnaradzay,A lot of things don't appear as they seem,3,28 June 2005,"It was a wildly awful plan: kidnap Churchill from his seaside cottage. Don't kill him, just borrow him for a while to negotiate a better truce. How sensitive. Hey, they did got Il Duce in the same way. As the fates would have it, Duvall was given the job of making it happen and luck was on his side. The plan needed a gutsy, ""nothing to lose"" type of officer. Luck again: Michael Cain. A highly decorated German SS officer is about to face the death sentence (for saving a Juden. Why? Who cares, logic will only get in the way of the plot). Things are going just great when, BAD LUCK. A small group of US Rangers are camped out in town. How did the great Nazi's miss this point. For goodness sakes, they had Donald Sutherland parading around town as a Marsh Warden, they had a mole in town scoping everything out at Churchill's abode! How did they get every detail about the town correct and overlook a whole bunch of US Army Rangers?! Don't let another lapse in plausibility spoil the plot. OK. so the Germans land in town disguised as Polish (I thought they lost the war?) paratroopers (not the ones who bought parachutes that open on impact). The German/Poles are running around town practicing maneuvers (wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Just to add some spice, Donald Sutherland, using a great can of red hair dye that came with a thick brogue, gets a little innocent 19 year old girl to fall in love with him. How nice. How did he do it? Must have been the way he espoused poetry. Plausibility has to be suspended again for us to believe that smack in the middle of a war, the lass is ready to give up, nay, SHOOT, her long time beloved. The best action scene is when Sutherland opens up a can of pugilistic poetry on the nose of the town's only sensible guy. I love it when Sutherland says: Don't worry father, we were just discussing the trinity: Foot work (bam, a shot to the guy's nose, Timing (whack, anothe shot to the nose), and jabbing (pow, sock'em, down goes the good guy). It reminded me of Ingrid Bergman teaching the street urchin to fight in The Bells of St. Mary. The novel by Higgins was good because I believed that the Germans were actually German. The movie fails to convince me that Michael Cain,Anthony Quayle, Donald Pleasance, and every other English speaking actor is a German. Accents come and so fast that the actors lose the plausibility factor. And Larry Hagman's acting is over the top. Did the director intentionally ask him to be a buffoon. I knew after he spouted his first lines that two things were going to happen to him: 1) he was going to be dead very soon. 2) He was going to jeopordize the mission (the Germans could pull it off) 3)Michael Cain was going to show his keen bravado by making Hagman's character die young. It was a set up. Larry Hagman is a great dramatic actor. If you don't think so, then I suggest you watch him in go line for line with Henry Fonda in Fail Safe. The ""action"" scenes are reminiscent of a gunfight scene on ""The A team"". GI Joe's jump, roll, and come up firing. Perfect shots, right through the narrow window casing that happens to have a crack German paratrooper positioned perfectly in the center of the frame. What luck again!. The crack German paratroopers forgot everything they learned about having a low profile. Even I know that you should not stand in the middle of a window. But then, how would we get to see them do the famous front head dive with a half-gainer. I wanted to feel something for Michael Cain's character: A man with conviction. A man of valor who happened to be wearing the wrong uniform. But I just couldn't believe it. He is the character that knows better than everyone else. If he knows so much why does he end up so dead?This was the last film for director John Sturges. He really gave depth to the characters he directed in The Great Escape and The Magnificent Seven. But he missed the ""depth"" chapter for characters in this movie. He chose all English actors (a casualty of ITC, the movie's distributor?) to act like Germans. Whassup with that? In the Great Escape he had Germans play Germans, Americans play Americans, and Donald Pleasance play an Englishman. What a concept. Well, the Germans couldn't pull off taking WC. Everyone gets their just rewards. Don't bother watching it. Even Winston Churchill was a fake. If you want to see a good movie with many similarities then watch Went the Day Well.",The Eagle Has Landed
80,scrbblr,"Brave, honorable, resourceful Nazis vs. bumbling imbecilic Americans",2,3 December 2008,"There's a certain sort of militaristic, maladjusted creep -- I've met a few in my time -- who's fascinated by Nazis to the point of idolatry. (Often, too, he's an expert on German regalia, uniforms, weaponry, etc.) Guys like this must love ""The Eagle Has Landed,"" because the Nazis in it are -- with a few exceptions -- paragons of courage and virtue. (The few exceptions are, as usual, the Gestapo and the SS. As in another popular sympathy-for-the-Nazis movie, ""Das Boot,"" these branches make convenient villains, serving as a contrast to the clean-cut good-guy Germans who just happen to be fighting for the Fuhrer because...well, they're patriots, that's all; they have absolutely nothing against Jews, and they despise those slimy fanatical Gestapo bastards -- honest!) The Michael Caine character in ""Eagle"" actually incurs punishment for trying to save a Jewish woman's life (how heroic can you get?); later, rather than shoot an unwary American sentry, he simply knocks the man unconscious. One of Caine's men dies rescuing a little English girl from drowning. The Germans take English villagers hostage but honorably let them all go unharmed, then die together fighting for the Fatherland rather than surrender.Meanwhile, the Americans are headed up by Larry Hagman, playing a cartoonish officer straight out of the Three Stooges. When he learns that Nazis have landed in England to kidnap Churchill and are holding hostages in a nearby church, he -- get this! -- refuses to inform central command; you see, he wants the glory all to himself. He and most of his men end up dead, sometimes in Keystone Kops style. (One jeep goes hurtling off a road into a river; Hagman himself puts on a surprised, comic, almost cross-eyed face when he gets shot and tumbles down a flight of stairs.)England herself fares little better. One muscular villager is a hostile lout whom Donald Sutherland, as an England-hating IRA agent, effortlessly beats to a pulp, and does so without losing his impish Irish grin. (In real life, said lout would have kicked the reedy Sutherland all over the set.) Sutherland trades a few romantic quips with a village lass played by Jenny Agutter; they have maybe five or six minutes of conversation (fully clothed, which is rare for Agutter), whereupon the lass falls so deeply in love with the IRA man that she shoots the English lout dead and proceeds to betray her fellow villagers -- indeed, her entire country. I suspect that some scenes developing the relationship may have been cut; still, shame on Agutter, Caine, and every other Briton involved in this production. If Britain were as feckless as this, its citizens would now be speaking German (or Gaelic).A few commentators have mentioned this movie's similarity to a little-known English film called ""Went the Day Well?"" It was made during the war, on a much tinier budget, in black and white, without any international stars (unless Leslie Banks qualifies as one), but its characters are better drawn, and it's far more suspenseful and about a thousand times more charming.",The Eagle Has Landed

""Eagle"" elicits an average performance from Michael Caine and a laughable one from Donald Sutherland (whose ""enigmatic Irish rebel"" act just doesn't wash). Deadly boring performances from Jenny Agutter and Jean Marsh fail to illuminate on the distaff side. You could do better by tracking down a copy of Went The Day Well and watching that instead.",The Eagle Has Landed
82,depaderico,Skip the first hour,7,7 March 2011,"This movie gets off to one slow start. On top of polluting an otherwise good film with redundant characters from the Nazi high command having endless conversations, it is difficult to understand their dialogue, as it is delivered in a kind of thick German accent -- and our edition has NO SUBTITLES. My friends and I literally paused the movie after about forty-five minutes and discussed just giving up and watching something else. We decided that we would wait until we got to Michael Caine and Donald Sutherland. I'm glad that we did.Let me go ahead and say that a distracting issue with this movie is that the Germans all speak English. Most unfortunate, they do so with different English accents. Donald Sutherland's character is an Irish German, and he has an Irish accent! What were they thinking?But as most other reviewers have noted, the second half is exceptional. The young American sergeant is honestly one of the most accurate portrayals of an American soldier that I have ever seen on screen. The American stereotype general is, on the other hand ... a stereotype. He's a bit unrealistic and overused.Michael Caine is, as always, splendid. It is great to watch a younger Mr. Caine in film. To witness his poise and delivery in this film, back when he was in his physical prime, is a memorable experience.Honestly, skip up until you get to the scene with Donald Sutherland: the rest is completely useless prattle.

83,allen-conway-1,bloody awful with comic moments,1,29 August 2010,"/SPOILER/ Is this comedy or drama? Comedy perhaps... Donald Sutherland's attempt to speak now and again with an Irish accent is so bad and the fact that he plays some kind of Latin lover capable of winning a young girl's heart and her mind - she is willing to betray her country for him after all - must make him a comic figure. Then there are the Good Germans who are not Nazis and who are willing to die to save the life of a Polish Jew... very believable. Good Germans and stupid Americans. Comic relief perhaps. Strange how the Germans can't miss when they are killing the blundering first attack and they can't hit when it's the turn of the Good Americans to attack. No one ever reloads either, but that, I suppose, is a constant in war films, be they good or ridiculous.Characters appear then disappear for no apparent reason. People betray or seem to change their minds at the first opportunity. Stoic Germans die rather than surrender. A German commando plays Bach and dies at the keyboard of the organ - what a comic moment that is! Oh, I almost forgot the Good German played by Robert Duvall. He comes complete with an eye patch and perhaps a missing left arm. /SPOILER/All in all, then, as bad a film as you could possibly imagine, perhaps worse even than that.

Besides that a good supporting cast.But what is more important in this well done movie is the complexity of the war combatants - e.g. Caine trying to save a jewish women from certain death, one of his soldiers saving a little English girl from drowning at the water mill, Hagman as an incompetent, but yet war loving officer, sacrificing of an actor who takes over Churchill's part.

Cain's character (a ""lovely man"", as the lovable rogue calls him) is one of Germany's 'true' toy-soldiers fighting the good fight (and hamming it up) albeit reluctantly in the name of the Fuhrer.

90,GurraJG,"Good acting, but a poor script",8,10 January 2005,"""The Eagle Has Landed"" is based on Jack Higgins bestselling book by the same name. And even though it may sound as a cliché to say this, the book is better than the movie.When Mussolini is rescued by the SS, Hitler wants to kidnap Winston Churchill. Colonel Max Radl (Robert Duvall) is tasked with planning the kidnapping, and the actual operation is to be carried out by a court-marshaled Colonel called Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine) and his band of elite paratroopers. The plan is to drop into a small town called Studley Constable as Polish paratroopers and kidnap Churchill.The book focuses a lot on the planning stage of the operation, but a lot of this is lost in the movie. Quite a few important parts are left out, but the movie is still easy to understand, especially since the Germans don't speak English with a heavy accent of German.The cast in this movie is an all-star cast, but opposed to films like ""The Longest Day"", it's not to much of a disturbance. The acting is very good, with special credits to Donald Pleasance as Himmler. However, Jenny Agutter, who plays Molly, is an exception. She really doesn't play her part to well, mainly because the characters part is reduced a great deal from the book, in which the relationship with the Irish Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland) plays a much larger role.In all, the movie is decent attempt at making a good film from the book. It has good acting, but fails when it comes to the story. However, the acting and the descent action saves this movie, and it's a good movie to see if you like WWII movies.

Kurt Steiner and his men were sentenced to serve in a prison unit, suicide missions, for actions they took to save a Jewish girl on the eastern front. Therefore they were not spies, but taking this mission was the only option they had to avoid dying one at a time riding piloted torpedoes into allied ships. Since these men were not spies, they did not want to be treated as such if captured in England, and thus insisted on wearing their German Paratrooper uniforms under their polish gear. Perhaps what some people do not understand about the second world war was that not all German troops were Nazis, or SS. The paratroopers were for the most part an arm of the regular German forces, Air Force (Luftwaffe) and were know for being fiercely brave and proud, and playing by the code of war. These men fought even when they knew defeat was certain, and resisted right to the end of the war, regardless of their opinions on Hitler or the Nazis. Not unlike other brave troops in todays world who go to war, in spite of their opinions of their own governments.

There must be hundreds of as yet unknown Irish actors who could have played the part convincingly but we have to put up with an American ""star"" who insults our intelligence with his pathetic attempt at an Irish accent. I ask, and not for the first time: Where a part requires an actor to speak in a regional accent, can we please have an actor who is capable of delivering that accent accurately, even if the actor is hitherto unknown, rather than some ""big name"" actor who is happy to earn a large pay packet for insulting viewers with a puerile attempt at the accent.
