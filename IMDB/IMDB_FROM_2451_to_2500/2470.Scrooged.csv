0,MartinHafer,"I know a lot of folks like this one...I sure didn't. I found it loud, garish and annoying.",3,7 May 2021,"""Scrooged"" is a very hard sell for me from the outset. I have long felt that there have been WAY too many versions of ""A Christmas Carol""...way too many. Think about it, in addition to the traditional versions, there have been Flintstones, Mr. Magoo, Sanford & Son, Jetsons and Mickey Mouse versions. And, when I last looked, IMDB listed nearly 100 different versions of this Dickens story. Except for a few rare instances (such as ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" and ""Blackadder's Christmas Carol""), the many, many versions are just too many. And what innovations does ""Scrooged"" offer? Well, it's angrier, meaner, and features a Christmas Spirit that kicks the grouch in the crotch and punches him repeatedly for laughs, some nipples, as well as cursing...making it a lousy bet for family viewing!I won't bother talking about the plot.....EVERYONE knows it already other than it's a modern retelling of the story. The big difference here is that it appears as if they just let Bill Murray run amok with the adlibs and jokes....which, to me, just didn't fit in to the story at all. It also lacked subtlety and was rather ugly. The film certainly was NOT sweet and fun like ""Groundhog Day"", ""What About Bob?"" or ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"". No...it is just abrasive. And, in its own way, it is very cynical.So was there anything I liked about the film? Not much...though it was nice seeing Robert Mitchum and John Houseman in small roles. Also, the mouse with the antlers was cute. But apart from that....nothing.",Scrooged
1,bkoganbing,Puts A Little Love In Your Heart,8,18 October 2011,"Charles Dickens's classic Christmas tale gets a late 20th Century makeover with Bill Murray as our protagonist. Murray plays a hardboiled TV executive who only sees Christmas as a commercial opportunity to get the best ratings. The usual ghosts from Christmases past, present, and future visit Murray and in a more contemporary idiom explain the error of his ways. No need to explain this universally beloved plot, I think other than the Christmas story itself, more people know this story than any other in the English speaking world.A couple of Hollywood veterans John Forsythe and Robert Mitchum have some nice supporting roles. Both are TV executives, Forsythe from his past and who Bill Murray was something of a protégé. Robert Mitchum is the Bill Paley/David Sarnoff network tycoon and who already sees some flaws in Murray's approach and is grooming a smarmy John Glover to take his place.The Bob Cratchit part is split in two with Murray's secretary going home to a not so Merry Christmas with the family when the expected bonus she was counting on doesn't materialize, she gets a network monogrammed towel like everyone else. She's played by Alfre Woodard and she's drowning in some real 20th century debt. The junior executive Murray fires is Bobcat Goldthwait and he doesn't take his Christmas Eve sacking in the resigned frame of mind the original Cratchit it. As this is the ever zany Goldthwait his method of dealing with it is unorthodox.The spirits of the past, present, and future are played by David Johanssen, Carol Kane, and Michael J. Pollard. Of the three and in fact in the film Carol Kane is the best. She certainly has an original way of getting one's attention.Karen Allen plays the girl that Murray loved and lost and Scrooged gives him an interesting opportunity to make that up as well as change his way of living. Scrooged is first and foremost a Bill Murray show and Bill Murray delivers on all levels. All the spirit of Dickens is maintained, in fact when the cast in the finale starts singing Put A Little Love In Your Heart over the closing credits, isn't that what Charles Dickens meant to say what Christmas does?",Scrooged
2,Leofwine_draca,Funny revamp of a classic story,6,29 December 2012,"SCROOGED is a cynical '80s retelling of the famous Dickens story, transplanted to modern society and featuring a crass TV producer who must learn the error of his ways when confronted by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. It's fast-paced, refreshingly mean-spirited, and quite simply good fun.The main reason for this film's success is, of course, Bill Murray, delivering a delightfully deadpan turn as an absolutely villainous character. His Frank Cross is the epitome of '80s-era greed and commercialism, and Murray nails it from the outset. It helps that he's given great support (the underrated Karen Allen and Bobcat Goldthwait in particular), but this is the Murray show through and through.Okay, so watched today, some of the special effects look a little rubbery, and some of the schmaltzy stuff feels a little twee, but it doesn't matter. SCROOGED has a great script, lots of successful gags that come thick and fast, and another good turn from the reliable Murray. What's not to love?NB. I rewatched this film once more to see how it holds up in high definition. It looks a treat, and the '80s-style special effects are fine and pleasingly macabre. However, I think Murray's shouty performance is a bit too much. It's not the actor's fault, but rather director Richard Donner's, who insisted on everything being dialled up to 11. I think if the film had been a little more subtle and nuanced it would have been an all-time classic; as it stands it's merely a fun and snappy '80s variant on the famous storyline.",Scrooged
3,SnoopyStyle,black comedy for Christmas,7,6 December 2014,"Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is the arrogant cynical president running IBC TV network. He aims to bastardize the Christmas classics. He overworks his assistant Grace Cooley (Alfre Woodard) and fires Eliot Loudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait) who questions his methods. Preston Rhinelander (Robert Mitchum) is his boss and Brice Cummings (John Glover) is after his job. He ignores his only brother James (John Murray) and rather be alone. He is reunited with his true love Claire Phillips (Karen Allen) after 15 years apart. He is visited by Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen), Ghost of Christmas Present (Carol Kane) and finally Ghost of Christmas Future.Bill Murray is a modern Ebenezer Scrooge in this black comedy. It is dark and he is meaner than Ebenezer. It's not really a laugh fest unless you have a demented sense of humor. Murray is sarcastic and angry, and perfect for the role. Carol Kane is a great loud violent foil to him. She has some of the funniest scenes. It's a touching tale of redemption every bit as much as the classic.",Scrooged
4,Hitchcoc,"No Holiday Spirit to ""Scrooged""",3,22 March 1999,"As an admirer of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" and one who has watched the Reginald Owen, Alastair Sim, Gene Lockart, and even the Henry Winkler versions several times, I found this to be a great disappointment.  I am a great fan of Bill Murray (Groundhog Day is a great favorite of mine), and I don't mind his mugging cynicism at all.  But his character in this movie is hateful.  At no time do I care about him, even in the flashback with his family, which, I suppose, is designed to tug at our heartstrings.  His epiphany is silly and insincere, making the last ten minutes an eternity. The charm of ""A Christmas Carol"" is that Scrooge once had love in his soul, but it needed to be let out through self discovery.  As Bill Murray invites people to join him, he is still smirking--doing Saturday Night Live schtick--making fun of his own movie.  Even if this is intended as a parody of the original, it is so cold, it doesn't work.",Scrooged
5,Prismark10,The Night the Reindeer Died,9,26 February 2016,"Scrooged was a starring vehicle for Bill Murray who teamed up with director Richard Donner for this re-working of Dicken's A Christmas Carol.The movie is essentially a 'concept vehicle' a term in vogue at the time. A starring role for Murray, make him a high powered television executive and team him up with an action director who had success a year earlier with Lethal Weapon.Bill Murray is climbing the corporate media ladder as the ruthless, cynical, mean and heartless Frank Cross. In his office he has a sign which defines Cross. 'Something you nail people to!'For Christmas Murray has devised a multi location live television broadcast which has to be the show to watch with a strong promotional clip to publicise it which makes his fellow executives sick. However he has to contend with a rival, John Glover, there to help out but actually eyeing up his job.One night before Christmas his old television boss (John Forsythe) who has been dead for years visits him and tells him to mend his ways and informs him that he will be visited by three ghosts.They include the Ghost of Christmas past, a cigar smoking cab driver, the Ghost of Christmas Present, an angelic fairy who likes a bit of the rough stuff and certainly dishes it out, finally the Ghost of Christmas Future, a terrifying dark hooded figure who would certainly scare the kids.Each ghostly spectre takes Murray to a time and place. Such as when he was young and dorky working his way up in television and in love with Karen Allen. As time goes by he becomes obsessed with work and frustrated by Allen's do-gooder attitude.Murray actually calls on Allen when he his spooked out and finds out that she is helping out with the homeless but she stirs something in Murray who his still a Grinch.There is no Cratchit in this movie that part in effect goes to Alfre Woodard who plays Murray's secretary and Bobcat Goldthwait plays an executive whose life heads towards a downward spiral when he is dismissed by Murray.I remember the film was largely dismissed by critics when the film was released but it is rather an enjoyable reworking of Dicken;s story. Murray despite not getting on with the director pitches it just right, almost remaining lovable even though he is mean spirited. I rather enjoyed his Richard Burton impression. The film has lots of star cameos from John Houseman, Lee Majors, Jamie Farr, Anne Ramsey and Robert Mitchum as Murray's cat obsessed boss.Director Richard Donner adds plenty of social commentary with references to apartheid South Africa for example.The ending might be regarded as tad sentimental which follows the book, but once they start singing the final song even you would want to 'Put a Little Love in Your Heart.'",Scrooged
6,kosmasp,Bill Murray(d),8,5 April 2021,"If you had any doubt about the talent that is Bill Murray ... another fine example why you shouldn't doubt him. He can be sweet and funny in one moment ... and mean and funny in the next! Just like that and it works like a charm. Now the story of Scrooge is very well known ... even to our characters in this movie too. That doesn't mean that we can't have some tweaks and changes along the way.And the movie does a really fine job with that. Not to mention that it really has one of the best castings I have seen for a movie like that. So many incredible people besides Murray ... it's just simply amazing. It may be a bit too grim for some at places, but it still has its heart in the right place! And while the breaking of the fourth wall at the end may seem strange - even that is funny while not being able to achieve what it would have on the big theatre screen.",Scrooged
7,gavin6942,Modern Christmas Classic,7,28 November 2014,"A selfish, cynical TV executive (Bill Murray) is haunted by three spirits bearing lessons on Christmas Eve.Does anyone know how many times ""A Christmas Carol"" has been turned into a film? Surely it would not be an exaggeration to say one hundred. But of those, very, very few go on to become classics (because, honestly, who needs to watch the same story over and over). This, after almost twenty years, seems destined to be a classic. Already it gets a solid holiday rotation.What makes it different is the updating (most seem to focus on the Dickens era) and the injection of humor. And even among those that have humor, how many have Bill Murray? Probably no other. Surround him with a great cast (including his own brothers) and you have a solid film.",Scrooged
8,lee_eisenberg,one of the many movies in the theaters when we moved into our new house,8,30 August 2006,"Another movie adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol""?! Yes, but a new kind, with Bill Murray as a creepy executive about to get a new lease on life. Murray does his usual goofy stuff. I think that my favorite line was ""You are just a hallucination brought along by alcohol! Russian vodka poisoned by Chernobyl!"" I bet that Charles Dickens never envisioned anyone mentioning a nuclear disaster in an adaptation of his novel.So, it's not any kind of great movie, but funny just because of what Murray does. Many years after it came out, I learned that it was in the theaters when we moved into our new house (others included ""Rain Man"" and ""The Naked Gun""). But that's just a side note. The point is that this is a pretty funny movie, and you're sure to like it. Also starring Karen Allen, John Forsythe, John Glover, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, Robert Mitchum, Michael J. Pollard, Alfre Woodard, Jamie Farr, Robert Goulet, Buddy Hackett and Lee Majors.The Manson Family Christmas! Ha!",Scrooged
9,jboothmillard,Scrooged,4,29 December 2010,"From director Richard Donner (Superman, The Omen, Lethal Weapon), it was a question on my mind whether filmmakers could do the classic Christmas story set in the present day, and this was certainly the chance to see. Basically an American US TV station is planning a live Christmas Eve production of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol, but the guy making it all happen, programming executive Francis 'Frank' Xavier Cross (Bill Murray) is a cold-hearted, selfish and mean bigot. Having spent years being the way he is, and being Christmas Eve, he is visited by the spirit of his dead boss, Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) and told that he could be like him if he doesn't change. Just like the Dickens tale he also says Frank will be visited by three other ghosts to try and mend his ways and appreciate the Christmas spirit, and he ignores it at first thinking he was dozing. While walking around the television studio however, Frank is first visited by the cab driver Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen), who shows him his childhood and growing up, including falling in love Claire Phillips (Starman's Karen Allen), and ultimately becoming mean. Next is the life-size pixie Ghost of Christmas Present (Carol Kane) who shows Frank all the people who know him and he finds out what they really think of him behind his back. Finally the seven-foot-tall ghoul, The Ghost of Christmas Future shows Frank what will happen in the time to come if he doesn't make a difference to his life. Of course Frank returns to the TV studio with a change of heart, even interrupting the live broadcast to increase salaries and wish the viewers a Merry Christmas, and he shares a kiss with Claire. Also starring Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment's Bobcat Goldthwait as Eliot Loudermilk, Robert Mitchum as Preston Rhinelander, John Glover as Brice Cummings, Alfre Woodard as Grace Cooley, Brian Doyle-Murray as Earl Cross, Throw Momma from the Train's Anne Ramsey as Woman in Shelter, The Love Bug's Buddy Hackett, Beetle Juice's Robert Goulet and Lee Majors. Murray for the first half of the film is the kind of modern Scrooge you would expect with his sarcastic comments and humorous grouchy demeanour, but the rest of the film does indeed go into sentimental mush and get less funny, overall, I don't necessarily agree with the critics' three stars out of five, but not a terrible seasonal comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Okay!",Scrooged
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Not Your Family Scrooge Story, But Has Its Moments With Murray",5,21 July 2006,"This was a pretty entertaining update of the famous ""Scrooge"" story. Unfortunately, however, that update includes profanity which certainly isn't necessary for this famous story.When the special-effects start, the movie kicks in. Bill Murray is convincing in his role as the bad guy - Bill usually is entertaining, like him or not - and Karen Allen is winsome when she flashes that pretty smile. Two minor characters are decidedly not funny: Carol Kane as the ghost is just plain annoying and Bob Goldthwait's voice is irritating.Like other versions of Scrooge, this one also has a touching ending. In fact, there are several very touching moments in this film despite the edginess to it. Then again, that's the message of the story.",Scrooged
11,rmax304823,Fantasy Refurbished.,6,22 November 2012,"What always impressed me about Dickens' original tale, aside from the serious message and the edgy bitterness, was that Ebeneezer Scrooge at the end never became a Franciscan fool. Scrooge didn't quit being a man of business, give everything away, and take a vow of poverty. He simply stopped being less of a turd head and more of a Mensch. It's a lesson that resonates as much today as it did in 1843. It's that our choice isn't necessarily between two extremes -- ""socialism"" and ""Ayn Rand"". There is a middle road that some of us seem unwilling to recognize.I think this is what Hollywood called ""a high concept movie."" ""A Christmas Carol"" has been done to death. It's been done seriously and made into a musical. Now it's time for another telling of the tale, but this time let's make it a comedy with a the usual sentimental ending.There are a horde of recognizable faces on the screen, from Robert Mitchum to John Housemann, but the movie belongs to Bill Murray as the modern Scrooge, head of IBC who insists on a live broadcast of ""A Christmas Carol"" on Christmas Eve, even though everyone knows that people should be enjoying their family dinners and not glued to the telly.Frankly, it didn't sound promising. And in fact it had its unfunny violent slapstick moments, as when the Spirit of Christmas Present, Carol Kane, kicks Murray in the family jewels and drops him howling to the floor. That's not the only example of mayhem that pushes the envelope.Yet, even though we know what's going to happen, it's possible to get swept up into the story. There are, of course, CGIs but they don't overwhelm us. They're used judiciously, which is refreshing in itself. And Murray just can't be too serious, especially during the cornier moments when he should be. As the end credits role over Murray standing on the TV set and surrounded by cast and crew, all singing ""Get A Little Love In Your Heart,"" an emetic scene in itself, Murray addresses the camera and shouts things like, ""Okay, now just the people on the left side of the theater!"" And then he shouts for ""All the women! No, no -- the REAL women!"" It sounds as if he's deliberately sabotaging the clichéd scene and, in the process, bringing a little subversion to all the painful joy. ""FEED ME, Seymour!,"" he shouts. It has nothing to do with the story but it's an allusion to ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" in which Murray played the part of a dentist's pain freak. Still, Murray's efforts to undercut the clichés notwithstanding, it goes on too long. Nobody, not even Santa Claus, could have relieved the distress of that ending.It's not a masterpiece but a lot of effort has gone into it, it's sometimes actually touching and sometimes quite funny, and there are gags that work.",Scrooged
12,BA_Harrison,A Murray Christmas to one and all!,8,21 December 2020,"Between directing Christmas-based action movie Lethal Weapon and its inevitable sequel, Richard Donner gave us a different kind of Christmas classic... Scrooged, a contemporary reimagining of Dicken's seasonal favourite A Christmas Carol. The film opens very much in Lethal Weapon mode, with machine guns ablazing, as Lee Majors helps Santa in his fight against heavily armed terrorists; this scene is from 'The Night the Reindeer Died', one of the many programmes scheduled for the festive break by cynical TV station president Frank Cross (Bill Murray), for whom the holiday season means one thing only: a chance to up the station's viewing figures.As Cross prepares the jewel in his scheduling crown, a live broadcast of A Christmas Carol, he finds himself visited by his long-dead boss (John Forsythe), who tells him he will be visited by three ghosts: The Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen), who reminds Frank of his biggest regrets; The Ghost of Christmas Present (a hilariously oddball turn by Carol Kane), who shows him how his current horrible behaviour is affecting others; and The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who shows him his not-so-bright future. These three visitations trigger a Scrooge-like change of heart in Frank, who, in the feel-good finale, understands what Christmas is really all about, broadcasts a cheery message, leads a sing-along, and hooks up with old flame Claire Phillips (Karen Allen).Like a trial run for his only-slightly-less-contemptuous character in Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's Frank makes the absolute most of the SNL star's acerbic brand of wit. Murray is the linchpin of the film, but his dry sarcasm is perfectly complemented by the more eccentric turns from Johansen and Kane, who provide many of the film's most memorable moments (Kane, dressed in fairy costume, but packing a mean punch, manages to be frighteningly unhinged yet strangely alluring). Also, Bobcat Goldthwait, as sacked station employee Eliot Loudermilk, is as bizarre as always, especially when he turns up toting a shotgun to take revenge on his boss (the uplifting ending to the film spares showing him being gunned down by trigger-happy cops).Donner proves just as adept at comedy as he is at action and horror (he gave us the '70s classic The Omen), giving us an assured slice of slick entertainment that, while not overly stylish, still impresses with its charming pre-digital visual effects, plus great make-up by Tom Burman (Forsythe's zombie make-up is superb). There's also one particular moment that stands out to me as truly macabre: Frank has freaky visions while talking to his boss in a restaurant, including a waiter catching fire. A one-of-a-kind, demented-yet-touching, Dickens-inspired classic with scenes of agonising fiery death: that's Scrooged!",Scrooged
13,moonspinner55,Bill Murray gets 'scrooged' by over-production...,5,12 November 2005,"Woefully heavy, noisy, over-produced holiday comedy rethinks ""A Christmas Carol"" for the modern (i.e., ""cynical"") new generation. In this scenario, wisecracking, rapid-fire Bill Murray is a good fit as a rotten TV network executive. He's initially a hoot, but the visiting ghosts and the constant stream of chattering characters weighs ""Scrooged"" down like an old fruitcake. Murray, pulling out all the stops, is a hearty actor who knows a great deal about nuance, but here his worst tendencies are encouraged and often he's just a nuisance. Karen Allen is a sweet love-interest and Alfre Woodard is wonderful as a harried secretary, but too many in the large supporting cast get stuck over-projecting in minor roles that don't call for so much caustic mania (Carol Kane and Bobcat Goldthwait are the biggest offenders). John Glover's sniveling villain is pitched so far over the top that he's not even a fun bad guy; the great Robert Mitchum is given nothing but weak material. Full of peaks and valleys, ""Scrooged"" is overly-dark and alienating, with an unshakable sense of claustrophobic smugness. ** from ****",Scrooged

15,hitchcockthelegend,Put a little love in your heart.,8,4 March 2008,"This is a perfect vehicle for Bill Murray, his brand of sarcastic and caustic delivery is nailed on perfect for Frank Cross, the modern day scrooge in this tale. I have often found him to be an acquired taste, I mean don't get me wrong here, I'm a big fan and can repeatedly watch his best offerings, but it's not hard to understand why his style is not universally loved. Scrooged is pure and simply the modern spin of the story we all have grown up with, that isn't to say that the film loses anything as regards Christmas spirit, because it doesn't, the message is still the same, and in this ever changing world of ours the core essence of the story is one the world should heed.This version is a blast, it's loud, it's brash, but boy is it damn funny, and I personally watch it every Christmas without fail. And yes, I watch it alongside the glorious Alistair Sim version, for although they are poles apart in class, they both entertain for very different reasons.Joining Murray in this festive romp is the delightful Karen Allen, while luminaries such as former New York Dolls front man David Johansen and Mr. Laconic himself, Robert Mitchum, add some weight to the cast list. It all works really rather well with the exception of Carol Kane's Ghost Of Christmas Present, where to me she comes off as being more annoying than funny, but that of course is a personal opinion and I know as fact that many others adore her energetic performance. With quips aplenty and of course with a simple heartfelt message at the core, Scrooged is truly a sharp and enjoyable film to be enjoyed at the festive period.

16,Scarecrow-88,Scrooged,5,12 December 2010,"Acerbic studio president, often loud and abrasive to those under his employ, gets a visit from three ghosts(and his deceased former boss, for whose place he took over, who prepares him for what awaits)who take him into the past, present, and future, in this noisy, brash, and often acidic satire on the Christmas season, taking shots at Charles Dickens' immortal story of Ebenezer Scrooge. Bill Murray never, to me anyway, looked comfortable in the role of Frank Cross, someone who polarizes everyone he comes in contact with, completely concerned with only his own needs and wants. John Glover is Brice, hired by the the leader of the studio, Preston(Robert Mitchum, who presents his character as if he's approaching senility), a potential problem for Frank's future as the man calling(most)of the shots. Glover is full of energy and enthusiasm, a ""people's guy"" who talks a mile a minute and seems very persuasive in gaining the favor of those around him.The first ghost(I'll get to Forsythe in a minute)is David Johansen(from the New York Dolls), Christmas Past, who drives a taxi cab full of smoke from his cigars, kind of resembling a chain-smoking, yellow-teethed elf(his has Vulcan ears)you might dig up in an alley somewhere catching zzz's in a cardboard box. Ghost Past carries him to his home as a child(whose meat market father is portrayed by Bryan Doyle Murray), not to mention, we see the love passed up for a career in radiant Karen Allen's Claire Phillips. The second is fairy Carol Kane, Christmas Present, with wings and a tutu, all sparkly, who enjoys smacking around Frank, punching him in the face repeatedly, as they visit his underpaid secretary's happy(if fatherless due to his murder)home and brother's party with friends. It's here Frank begins to see how empty his life is. The third is a ridiculously large, hulking Reaper as The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and Frank's visits (with the visual stylings of surrealistic art deco) involving his secretary Grace's visit to her mute son in a padded cell and Claire, now a cold hearted bitch who yells for pauper kids to leave her midst, are simply bizarre(and lack any form of emotional depth). The problem is when Frank ""finds the errors of his ways"" in regards to walking over innocent people to get to the top, it doesn't ring true or have any form of sincerity. Murray constantly barks loudly throughout the movie and never really captures your heart. This whole movie reeks of cynicism, and sadly lacks the Murray charm. I dunno, in the past I've enjoyed this movie, but this year it's so hollow and so many of the characters come off annoying and/or aggravating, especially Carol Kane who I wanted to see in a choke hold until her eyes popped out. Steller make-up work on Forsythe who informs Frank of the three ghosts' visits, a rotted corpse, with little flesh, mainly bones and dust. John Murray(Bill's actual brother)portrays Frank's brother, James. Alfre Woodard is Grace, Frank's beleaguered secretary. Bobcat Goldthwait is the poor employee who tells(correctly)Frank that his commercials for a bloody horror movie, SCROOGE(in name only), are ill advised, getting sacked in the process. Bobcat, drunk, unemployed, his wife having left him, goes berserk attempting to kill Frank with a shotgun at the end.

Since I am now finding myself catching up with several films from the 1980s that I missed out on when they originally came out, and given that we are in full Christmas swing, it was perhaps a given that I was going to give this one a look at this point in time. First of all, I was surprised to see that such a star-studded cast was roped in for what was, essentially, a largely unsympathetic re-reading of a beloved literary classic: Bill Murray (obviously essaying an Ebenezer Scrooge for the TV-fed generation), Karen Allen (as his neglected school sweetheart), John Glover, Bobcat Goldwaithe (as a sacked underling who takes matters into his own hands) and Alfre Woodard comprise the 'newer' talents; Jamie Farr (unrecognizable as Jacob Marley!), John Forsythe, John Houseman (introducing the current TV adaptation of the Dickens story currently being produced by Murray), Buddy Hackett (as TV's Scrooge), Robert Mitchum (as Murray's boss) and Michael J. Pollard (as an ill-fated tramp) make up the veterans' list; David Johansen and the insufferable Carol Kane (form two-thirds of the visiting ghosts; and even Miles Davis (in street musician mode!), Robert Goulet and action hero Lee Majors pop in to make an appearance as themselves!! Although the overlong coda tries very hard to infuse some good cheer into the dismal world-view that we have inhabited until then, I still cut this film some slack for going all the way on the fantasy stuff (the make-up artists received an Oscar nod for their troubles) and holding out somewhat on the soppy material (nevertheless, we do get a mute colored boy in place of the lame Tiny Tim!). Interesting and fairly enjoyable, then, but hardly a success and certainly far from hilarious.",Scrooged

He really is a Scrooge and is mean to his workers.So, who better to have a visit from the Christmas Ghosts?. Cross gets a visit from his former boss (deceased) who warns him of the imminent visitation of three ghosts. Cross writes this off as a hallucination brought on by stress and his network's big project, at least until the first ghost arrives and yanks him back to the past. The Ghosts are really free and they do a great job, particularly the abusive ghost of Christmas present (Carol Kane).There are interesting cameos from a variety of stars, such as Bobcat Goldthwait, Jamie Farr, Robert Goulet, and Mary Lou Retton.This is my favorite Christmas Carol Movie.",Scrooged

He's amazingly funny and on top of that he also is a wonderful actor. You can see that in some of the scene's he improvised a lot and he did that brilliantly! All the other actors and characters are merely sidekicks.The story is basically a modern version of the classic Dickens novel ""A Christmas Carol"" and it's done wonderfully. It's great to see how the the classic story is translated into the 20th century. Everything works very well: The settings, the characters and the events, everything.From the hilarious opening involving Santa Claus and Lee Mayors (I say no more) till the wonderful ending the movie delivers non stop fun and pure entertainment with a nice love story, brilliant dialog and a great and important message in it.

21,morrison-dylan-fan,The Night the Reindeer Died.,8,26 December 2012,"With having last year watched the wonderful films Christmas Holiday and A Holiday Affair for the first time,I decided to take a look round a shop that had an ""X-Mas DVD"" section"".Finding myself knee deep in cheap and tacky looking straight to DVD holiday ""cheer"",I suddenly noticed a title that was shining like a diamond in the rough.Taking a look at the back of the case,I was thrilled to find that the movie seemed to be a Black Comedy take on A Christmas Carol,which led me to get ready in seeing Scrooge get screwed.View on the film:Putting the classic Charles Dickens tale into the corporate world, (in this case,one that has ""the king of Noir"" Robert Mitchum looking high above it) screenwriters Michael O'Donoghue and Mitch Glazer, (who would later write the script for Alfonso Cuaron's 1998 take on Dickens Great Expectations) create a wonderfully acid tongue,ruthlessly sharp funny world,filled with people who show more care to their cash,than they do to their staff and viewers.Whilst the last 5 minutes of the movie do put the film on the ""traditional"" Dickens track,for the rest of the film,O'Donoghue and Glazer excitingly make this a Scrooge who might possibly not care at all about what any of the ghost warn him about,as Frank Cross hits out at anyone who gets in his sights,in his bid to air controversial-grabbing ""Holiday"" programs,which looking at them now,look eerily like shows that would now actually be aired on TV!.For the ghosts featured in the movie, (played by the wonderful John Forsythe,David Johansen,and the disappointingly grating Carol Kane) director Richard Donner wonderfully contrasts the business suit-wearing world of Cross,by making the ghosts eye-crashingly nasty creature's who look as if they have been pulled from a 50's Monster movie,or an EC comic,that also cleverly shows the decay of Cross's corporate world.Joining Donner just after he had directed the first highly praised movie the Lethal Weapons series,Bill Murray gives a tremendously witty,sarcastic performance as Frank Cross,that goes from Murray delivering wicked,Black Comedy slaying on anyone who dares to question his judgement,to be completely terrified out of his mind,from the visiting ghosts,who promise to give him a good dose of Christmas cheer.",Scrooged
22,anaconda-40658,Murray Gets Scrooged.,8,5 February 2016,"Scrooged (1988): Dir: Richard Donner / Cast: Bill Murray, Karen Allen, Bob Goldthwait, John Forsythe, Carol Kane: A parody of the Charles Dickens classic with a modern take on the tale. Bill Murray plays Frank Cross, a cynical program executive who is the modern day Scrooge. He objects to his secretary taking time off to deal with his son's inability to speak. He fires someone on Christmas eve. Plus he is making everybody's life miserable on the set of the Charles Dickens play that he is producing. Bill Murray is hysterical as Cross who believes that he is going crazy during a long night of interruptions by three ghosts that showcases scenes from his life from past, present and future. Cross is humbled in humorous fashion until a third act where everything goes way over the top. Karen Allen plays a former girlfriend who lends her services to a homeless shelter. Through flashbacks Cross is reintroduced to their first encounter through their budding relationship until pride divides them. Bob Goldthwait plays a fired employee whose drunken spree goes into overdrive of singing carols and brandishing a shotgun. John Forsythe plays Cross's ghostly boss who returns to give him a warning. Carol Kane is delightful as the ghost of Christmas present who cheerfully smacks sense in Cross. While its humour is too crass for younger viewers, its satire view of the classic tale is a well produced holiday laugh fest. Score: 8 / 10",Scrooged
23,HotToastyRag,I'm not a fan,2,19 August 2018,"Since I'm not a Bill Murray fan, it's no wonder his version of A Christmas Carol is one of the worst I've ever seen. And, since there are plenty of people who love him, there are plenty of people who love Scrooged and watch it every year. Like all art, movies are a matter of taste.In this modern take, Bill Murray stars as the cold miser whose life has passed him by and whose heart can only be warmed by the visit of three Christmas spirits. Since he's too young to feel life has passed him by, and since he's not the most convincing repenter in the world, to me, the story's message is lost in this version. The Ghosts of Christmas are the frightening David Johansen and the idiotic Carol Kane; and the love story with Karen Allen, normally a sweet and tender flashback in versions of A Christmas Carol, feels more like a one-night-stand than a lasting romance. Scrooged is dark and cynical, so if you're not normally a fan of Bill Murray's style, you probably won't like the movie. Like every other American, I watch Groundhog Day every year, but I always think how much better it would have been with the original casting of Michael Keaton in the lead. If you do rent this Christmas classic, you'll be treated to many cameos, which are always fun: Miles Davis, Robert Goulet, Lee Majors, Buddy Hackett, John Houseman, Brian Doyle-Murray, J. Pollard, John Forsythe, Alfre Woodard, and Robert Mitchum.",Scrooged

There is even another one coming out done in the same way as that ""Polar Express"" movie with Jim Carrey lending his voice and likeness as Scrooge. This one though surpasses all those other versions as I do not really care much for the story as it is. Why do I like this one then? It is funnier than all the others to me and Bill Murray does an excellent job in the lead role. A guy who is going to make people work on the holiday and suggests stapling little antlers on live mice. The story progresses a lot like all the others with the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future paying our guy a visit. Still, a lot different and there are some touching moments as well. There are also some parts of the movie that are overdone and let us face it, if you do not like Christmas that really is your business. I do not really care for how all these movies make it out to be a crime to not like Christmas. Still, for the most part the movie does not get all that heavy handed and there are a lot of laughs to be had as well. Not a super classic by an means, but it is a good Bill Murray movie.",Scrooged
27,SimonJack,A good idea for a spoof that falters,5,12 February 2015,"The premise for this movie was a good one. Have some fun, get some laughs and do a spoof with a modern adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol."" ""Scrooged"" has a good cast for the job, the makeup is excellent, and Bill Murray mostly carries the film. That's because the screenplay isn't very good. Still, I might have scored it a notch higher but for the crass and crudeness of the script and some of the design. Debit those items and work on the script for more laughs and this film could score well. The funny parts are when Murray's character, Frank Cross, slips in and out of his trips with the ghosts, only to find himself in the middle of the stage set or rehearsal or broadcasting, and fouling it up. His change doesn't seem very believable. And the ending is a sappy effort to bring the story to happy conclusion. If one wants a lot of laughs for a Christmas season movie, try ""Christmas Vacation"" 1989, ""Christmas in Connecticut"" 1945, or ""Christmas with the Kranks"" 2004. Those take a little bit of thinking, but they are clean and very funny.",Scrooged
28,Mr-Fusion,Always worth it for Bill Murray and holiday sentiment,7,13 December 2012,"Next to Peter Venkman, Frank Cross is my favorite Bill Murray character. It's a delightfully unhinged performance (lots of comedic screaming), not to mention some great physical comedy. I doubt I've ever found such enjoyment in someone else playing a complete prick. He was born to play this guy. And it's not just Murray. ""Scrooged"" features great performances from Karen Allen, Bobcat Goldthwait, Alfre Woodard and Carol Kane (whose sole job here is to kick the bejeezus out of Frank). This is one of those ""have-to""s every Christmas. It's got a great sense of humor, plucks the heartstrings and maintains an unnerving relevance with our current ratings-at-any-cost TV culture. It even puts a clever spin on the old Dickens classic. 8/10",Scrooged
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Bill Murrey in some of his funniest moments,8,2 February 2004,"I loved ""Scrooged"". It took a new turn and twist on a classic Christmas tale by Charles Dickens. Just think ""A Christmas Carole"" updated with the comedy stylings of Bill Murrey.Bill is absolutely hysterical in ""Scrooged"". I just love watching him interacting with the three ghosts. Also, another great twist. The first ghost of Christmas past is a smart alleck taxi driver who takes Frank on journey through his pathetic and wasted life of just wanting and thinking too much of his career instead of his family and friends. The ghost of Christmas Present, a wonderful comedic performance by Carole, is perfect. She takes Frank on a journey of seeing how his decisions are effecting his friends and brother, and despite his poor and careless ways, he's sees just by the joy of having a family and friends around that love you, you can have the best Christmas. And of course, the ghost of Christmas Future, where Franks sees the results of his decisions and what can happen.This is probably the first and only that can make me feel so good after I see it. All the performances are great and the story is just wonderful. This is a great Christmas flick that should be watched by everyone. Just put a little love in your heart and enjoy! Merry Christmas! See! It is effective! 8/10",Scrooged
30,blanbrn,A new take and twist on the Dickens classic!,7,29 December 2006,"Growing up as kids everybody became accustomed to the Charles Dickens tale ""A Christmas Carol"" thru readings, cartoons, and movies. Well in 1988 a film ""Scrooged"" with Bill Murray showed a new twist and different side to Christmas! ""Scrooged"" is a hilarious take-off of the Dickens classic as the story is told similar with the Christmas ghost of the past, present, and future, but with a modern day theme. Bill Murray is terrific as Frank Cross who is a nasty and cold TV network president who only cares about himself and no one else, he's simply a modern-day Scrooge. On Christmas Eve he's visited by a maniacal New York cab driver who takes him on the journey to the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future. Boy does his future sure look ghoulish, so Frank must change his ways! Overall this twisted and funny tale is just fine to watch every holiday season, not only is Murray's performance good, but the supporting cast from Karen Allen, John Forsythe, Carol Kane, and Alfre Woodard is super. It's nice to see a film that shows that Christmas can be funny and serious, and it's nice to put people first and love everyone. ""Scrooged"" is a fine film especially during the Christmas season, I even own it on DVD.",Scrooged
31,MovieAddict2016,One of the funniest Christmas films of all time. An annual treat!,7,23 December 2003,"Christmas movies are fun. I like Christmas movies because they're generally nice, lightweight, enjoyable pieces of fluff with important moralistic messages (""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Scrooge"") or sometimes they're just fun to watch (""Gremlins,"" ""Home Alone""). ""Scrooged"" isn't lightweight, cheery, or happy. It's dark, brooding, sort of evil, and it's the only Christmas movie I can think of that seems as if Tim Burton directed it.Am I insulting the film? Heavens, no. I love it. In fact, I'm complimenting it. Instead of repeating old traditions, it's trying something new, and the secret to the film is the way it actually pulls it all off.The plot: Frank Cross is the youngest television station president in recorded history because he knows the people. At least he thinks he does. In reality, he's just a greedy tycoon who gives people bath towels for Christmas -- including his own brother. Cross is a modern day Scrooge, and the movie ""Scrooged"" is a modern reworking of the classic Charles Dickens story. Frank Cross is played by Bill Murray absolutely perfectly. He's cynical, dry, and sarcastic, and doesn't give a darn about anyone else other than himself.So the night before Christmas Eve, Frank is visited by an old business partner -- who has been dead for seven years. (""I wouldn't have guessed more than three, tops,"" says Frank in his usual sarcastic tone.) His old associate warns Frank to change his ways or he'll end up like himself -- angry, bitter...and dead.Frank doesn't pay any attention to his ""hallucination,"" and continues being his usual self during the festive Christmas holiday -- by ripping off old ladies' cabs and firing Elliot (Bobcat Goldthwait) on Christmas Eve. (Elliot is sort of today's version of Bob Cratchitt.)Frank is putting on a Christmas Eve production of Charles Dickens' immortal classic ""Scrooge"" (what happened to ""A Christmas Carol,"" I wonder?), and in the film's funniest scene, introduces his ad for the program. (It later scares an old woman to death and Frank takes it as a wonderful sign -- controversy is as good as advertising!)The three ghosts do indeed come and haunt Frank. Except Frank is more cynical than Ebenezer Scrooge ever was, and convincing him that Christmas is a season of giving will be hard. (Frank: ""I get it, you're here to show me my past and I'm supposed to get all dully eyed and mushy. Well forget it pal, you got the wrong guy."")Frank is revisited by an old flame (Karen Allen) and his heart starts to beat once again after years of silence. Frank slowly but surely starts to learn to appreciate Christmas once again, following all of Scrooge's examples. His intern's son, who witnessed his father's murder and hasn't spoken since, is a sort of Tiny Tim, and ""Scrooged"" does indeed follow all of the elements of Charles Dickens' classic. Only it updates the tale, throws in a bunch of cameos, and great acting on Murray's behalf.Frank revisits scenes from his childhood and adulthood first hand with the wacky ghosts as companions. They can't see or hear Frank -- his cab driver ghost tells him that he's in the middle of a rerun.Frank remembers how his father brought him meat for Christmas, how he broke up with his girlfriend over a matter of greed vs. happiness, and how his life was a complete waste. (Ghost: ""Let's face it, Frank, garden slugs got more out of life than you."" Frank: ""Yeah? Name one!"")It was a matter of time before ""A Christmas Carol,"" or ""Scrooge,"" got a modernized treatment. And it comes out fresh and ingenious, dark and hilarious. The movie owes its entire success to the casting of Bill Murray, whose cynical ways shone through in such early films as ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters,"" and here compliment the film the way no other actor's talent could.Take, for example, the way he can remain unmoved but, at the same time, flippant and sarcastic, towards his boss when he tells Frank that cats and dogs are starting to watch television, and that he thinks Frank should target some advertising at the canine and feline demographic. Frank just stares at his boss as if he's crazy and whispers, ""Call the cops.""The movie was directed by Richard Donner (""Lethal Weapon""), and is one of the films I watch as an annual tradition around Christmas. It's dark and often quite disturbing, and its eerie music adds to the mix. But it helps the film because it makes us see through Frank's eyes. And the outcome is, quite frankly, an instant Christmas classic. This is a film I'll be watching for years, and so far, it's only been getting better every time.",Scrooged

33,sddavis63,Put A Little Love In Your Heart,5,18 July 2018,"You can call this my ""Christmas in July"" moment. I had recorded this movie way back on Christmas Eve of last year and somehow never got around to watching it. (Nor had I ever seen it before actually.) Discovering it among my recordings this morning, I thought - why not? So I turned it on. I loved the closing credit: ""Suggested by Charles Dickens."" Yes - a ""suggestion"" probably comes closest. Nothing more. It's a modern retelling of ""A Christmas Carol,"" starring Bill Murray as the ""Scrooge"" character (although in this, he's Francis Xavier Cross) - the completely mean-spirited head of a television network who's putting on what seems to be a very adult-oriented live version of Dickens' classic, forcing everyone to work on Christmas Eve and promoting it with some of the weirdest promos ever. He treats the network staff terribly, gives cheap towels with the network logo as Christmas bonuses, and fires one executive while making his assistant's life miserable. He's Scrooge, in other words. I find it amusing that some criticize this movie because Cross is mean. Um - he's Scrooge. He's supposed to be mean.All the elements of Dickens' story are there. The characters all have their own incarnations. There's a Marley's Ghost, and three spirits, and a Cratchit (well, really the above mentioned two) and a Tiny Tim and even a past love interest for Cross. One change to the story is that in this Cross has a boss of his own to deal with and who he feels unfairly treated by.Murray was fine in the role of Cross. The supporting cast ranged all the way from Buddy Hackett (as Scrooge in the IBC network's fictional adaptation) to John Forsythe as Cross's boss. Aside from Murray, the most memorable performance probably came from Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christmas Present, who was actually quite funny. The movie has an opening that certainly captures your attention - a shootout scene involving Santa Claus in his workshop at the North Pole - and that makes you wonder what the *** is going on here? It ends obviously with the account of Cross's redemption, although to be honest that struck me as way too over the top even for this movie and left me on a bit of a sour note. I did enjoy the rendition of ""Put A Little Love In Your Heart"" that played during the closing credits. People seem to have either a love it or hate it reaction to ""Scrooged."" I don't really get the extremes. It's not a Christmas movie that I could see myself wanting to watch every December (or every July) but it was pleasant enough viewing as a one time thing and it had a few chuckles thrown in.

May I add: I loved Carol Kane in this – she was a highlight. She added a lot to The Princess Bride, and here as well.

35,cherold,Entertaining alternate take on A Christmas Carol,7,5 January 2014,"Dickens probably wouldn't have been a fan of this version of his classic fantasy. While he wrote a tale of a cold-hearted businessman who was mean but whose actions were actually not that atypical for the time, making it a commentary on the evils of conscienceless capitalism, this Bill Murray vehicle is an attack not on general cruelty but on TV executives, and comes across as what it is; a TV writer's fantasy revenge, in which executives are sadists and censors are targets.While Scrooge was hard-hearted, he considered himself a good man of business who kept emotion and feeling out of the workplace. Murray's character, on the other hand, is pretty much a psychopath, gleefully spying on a suffering ex-employee in the parking lot. This makes his eventual transformation unlikely, and makes the movie more about not being a jerk than about being good and charitable.But while this movie has none of the message of the Dickens story, on its own it's actually quite fun, a fast paced, goofy comedy with entertaining special effects and good performances. Dickens would probably just hate this movie, but I rather enjoyed it.",Scrooged
36,Robert_duder,Yet another Christmas Carol rendition but with a lot of twists that work,8,26 December 2014,"In the 80's and early 90's Bill Murray knew exactly what his fans wanted from him. He had a distinct comedic style and he delivered almost every time. Scrooged was primed and ready for a Bill Murray performance and he is terrific in it. He can play a role completely sarcastically and yet you suddenly find yourself invested in the character and actually caring about him. Its what made him indelible in his SNL skit days. I am always amazed that Hollywood actually manages to take a concept that they have milked to death (in this case Charles Dickens' immortal classic A Christmas Carol) and actually find one more slightly unique way to do it. Scrooged puts the timeless tale inside of itself, puts an absolutely adult spin on it and turns sarcasm and brutal pessimism into a heartfelt story. I was even surprised by how touched I was by the final scenes. I was convinced they couldn't turn it into something tangible by the end and they do which really captures the Dickens spirit I think. Best of all, the film is very funny, laugh out loud funny with physical comedy, outrageous stunts and Murray's fast talking, witty one liners that really work especially if you're a fan of his.I seem to have already talked a lot about Bill Murray headlining the film. He is terrific in the ""Scrooge"" type role and you know what you're in for if you know his work in that period. Karen Allen is an unusual choice for Murray's romantic interest. I don't think I've seen Allen in much and being a huge Indiana Jones fan, I always recognize her as Indy's first love Marion. She's very plain but I don't mean that to be insulting. She's just very ""girl next door"", down to earth and looks very sweet in this film and it works very well. You actually really root for their romance because it feels so genuine. Its not that they have amazing chemistry but there is something the works. David Johansen and Carol Kane are two of our Christmas spirits. Kane is hilariously over the top and Johansen is pretty terrific too. Bobcat Goldthwait is fantastic in a small but significant supporting role, John Glover, Robert Mitchum and John Forsyth are all very good in small supporting roles. Alfre Woodard is good but a little underdeveloped as the ""Bob Cratchit"" type character, a nice little twist on the story and Nicholas Phillips is very good but completely underdeveloped as her son. The cast work very well together and fit their respective roles.Richard Donner is one of my favourite mainstream directors. He has directed some truly outstanding films and had an incredible start in Television too. He knows how to tell a terrific story and get the most out of characters. This is a little bit of a different type of movie for him but it definitely has a style unique to him as well. Even if someone absolutely hated or was sick of seeing ""A Christmas Carol"", Scrooged is told in such a way that you won't even realize what you're watching. Its different and fun and dark and twisted and almost satirical in many ways. Satire is a genre of comedy rarely done well anymore and this is an example of what it used to be like. Scrooged is also classically 80's in the way that it unabashedly uses sexual innuendos, gratuitous bad language and doesn't apologize for it regardless of the fact that its a Christmas film. So adults if you're looking for something with a little bite and something outside the box for a Christmas film and have never watched this I definitely recommend it. Its entirely entertaining. 8/10",Scrooged

This adds a nice 'meta' layer to the piece and allows it to reflect on the ever increasing 'extreme' nature of the 1980s. While the flick is predictable down to its last plot-point due to its strict adherence to its source story's rigid outline, the picture manages to set itself apart from the numerous other adaptations by being not only as emotionally resonant as you'd expect but also genuinely funny, too. The inventive visual effects and somewhat more relatable domestic aspects bring a fairly visceral and close-to-home feel, one that's compounded by the focus on interpersonal relationships and the fact that Murray's selfish cynic is constantly understandable, charmingly dissonant and yet every bit as despicable as you'd want him to be. 6/10",Scrooged

The best person in the whole movie had to be the Ghost of Christmas Present. She was just unbelievably funny and feisty, making for the film's best visual jokes. This ends up playing like most Christmas Carol adaptations, only with new funny original stuff.All of the Christmas ghosts are fun and even the title is a nice pun (I'm not trying to rhyme). Our protagonist isn't named Scrooge but he fits the bill. I especially like how they introduce The Ghost Of Christmas Future. It isn't who you think it is at first, or is it? It's a nice looking film that opens by showing a movie on TV making it look like it's part of the movie. Good for any Bill Murray fan like myself! ***",Scrooged

This is certainly not a cliché Christmas Carol remake that usually follows the same basic story arch. Scrooged is a very original version of the classic Charles Dickens story that is hilarious, mostly because of a fantastic and inspired performance from Bill Murray, as he plays a character that does feel very much like the Murray equivalent of Scrooge. I loved this movies take on the Three Ghosts of Christmas Eve, they were very different from previous versions, played by very comedic actors that were very much able to work with Murray and possibly improvised several lines which was great fun. It is a modern day Christmas classic that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or a nice movie to watch during the holidays.

41,CuriosityKilledShawn,Father LOVES Beaver!,10,18 April 1999,"Acid Rain. Drug Addiction. International Terrorism. Freeway Killers. Now, more than ever, it is important to remember the TRUE meaning of Christmas! Don't miss Bill Murray's immortal classic Scrooged. You're life might just depend on it.Christmas Specials are a big deal, with some of them (such as Charlie Brown and The Grinch) going down in TV history. When it comes to story a lot of lazy staff writers just milk the Christmas Carol goat and there are millions of different takes out there to prove it with Roseanne and the original Star Trek series all doing their own rip-offs. IBC boss Frank Cross (Bill Murray dressed up as Steven Seagal's long-lost twin brother) is a delightfully wicked man of hate who is planning his very own live broadcast of said story. Little does he know that very tale is about to wind its way into his life.Why I like Frank Cross is because he's a lot like me. He's mean to those beneath him, yields power with a ruthless swagger and is sarcastic to just about everyone. If you disagree with him in even the slightest, tiniest little way he'll fire you. Just like I would. But on this certain Xmas Eve life is getting very weird for him.The owner of the station is doubting his abilities to undertake such a heavy production, a slimy Californian director is trying to muscle-in on his job and his dead boss comes back to haunt him. He brings an important message that if he doesn't change his way he's going to hell and that three ghosts, of Xmas past, present and future, are going to show him the results of his evilness.In the hands of just another comedy director this would have been a missed opportunity, but Richard Donner shoots the film as a supernatural fantasy and gives it a pretty superior shine. Something Brian Levant could never do. And let's not forget Bill Murray, the guy is a genius no matter what he does and he dominates the whole film with his loud an maniacal performance. Everything he says seems to be ad-libbed and babbles some brilliant one-liners and sarcasm.Most people are put-off by the ending and claim that when the nastiness stops and sentiment kicks in the film goes downhill. I don't feel this way. In a world where Xmas is commercialised and the time of year where people go in huge debt we need a constant reminder of what we should be feeling. No one is asking you to celebrate the fact that Wal-Mart are selling cheap turkeys or that greedy stores have a limited stock of $700 X-Boxes. At the end Frank Cross, the world's biggest scrooge and non-believer, tells us that it's the fun, the determination to make a difference, the easiness of changing someone's life and the spirit of the holiday season that really matters. You don't have to hate it and if you surrender your pride and just give it a go then maybe the miracle to happen to you to.For me, Scrooged has been an annual tradition for years and will continue to be so. Not only is it very funny but, in its own way, very important. If you give a little, you can get back a whole lot more. Sounds corny, I know but Xmas is what you make it. And you only get a small amount so it's best to make every one count. This movie is a step in the right direction.",Scrooged
42,ironhorse_iv,This movie was kinda scrooge up. Could had been a little better.,7,2 January 2018,"Over the years, there has been many different variations & renditions on English author, Charles Dicken's 1843's novel; 'A Christmas Carol' story, through film. Yet, there hasn't been many adapted movies that sway too far for the source material. That was, until 1988's 'Scrooged'. Not only did it modernization, the settling of the Christmas Carol-like scenario with a different set of time, characters & locations, but it also, in universe, make fun of premise of loosely adapting the novel, by having a cynical, selfish TV executive, Frank Cross (Bill Murray) go through the ghostly visits, while also planning a live adaptation of the book for his network. Because of that, I can say, this black comedy directed by Richard Donner is unique enough to stand on its own; as much of the humor here is focuses on the shallowness, greed, and sensation of commercial television, when it comes to the holidays. However, the strange, mood-swingy blend of mistletoe jokes with that, satirical trash television doesn't really mesh that well, together. Much of that, come from the fact that actor, Bill Murray and director Richard Donner reportedly did not enjoy working together, creating a lot of tension on set. It shows in their work. Murray still depress over the failure of 1984's 'The Razor's Edge' gave a stagnant somewhat rusty detached performance as penny-pinching TV producer, Frank Cross (Bill Murray), as he never really wanted to return to comedy after four years away from the business. Because of that, along with Murray penchant for unwanted improvisation, taking real physical abuse by actress, Carol Kane, including injuries & oddly time, mood swings, which Donner wasn't keen on, a lot of footage ended up on the cutting room floor; making the film look very sloppy & uneven in certain parts. All this detached anger & mean-spirited by both men, never truly make it seem like Cross change into a decent person, by the end of the film. Instead, the climax come across as a little too unpleasant/cynical and not enough joyful. Most of the themes of the film doesn't even seem focus on moral redemption, at Christmas, at all. I felt that the film written by Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue was a little too unfocused, spending too much time on a competitor subplot with Bryce Cummings (John Glover) & a murderous ex-employee, Eliot Loudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait) that rarely affects the main plot. Another thing, the writing was a little heavy-hand on, showing the subliminal political/humanitarian reference to Apartheid controversy. It wasn't really needed. Another, preachy choice was showing the hypocritical when it comes to regulate violence & sexual content, with slapstick humor, & cartoony action. Because the focus was spent on that, it left little to the redemption parts. It really did seem those sequences got the short stick. Because of that, songs like 'Put a Little Love in Your Heart' perform by Annie Lennox & Al Green and written by Jackie DeShannon, Randy Myers & Jimmy Holiday seem to come, out of nowhere & seems oddly used. Nevertheless, the rest of the music choices, were alright for the most part. However, composer, Danny Elfman's score, does come across as jarring, because the fact, that he recycled parts of the tune for later films such as 1992's 'Batman Returns' & 1993's 'Nightmare Before Christmas'. As for visual & special effects, most of the effects, really does hold on, over the years. Even the makeup & puppet work for this film is still impressive. However, they did go, a little overboard at parts like Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) trying to kill Frank, by tossing him, off a building, rather than warning him about the three spirits. Nevertheless, regardless, the way, the movie was shot with the help from cinematographer, Michael Chapman was well-handle. There were parts of the film, where the spirits really did look like they were, about to jump out of the screen. As for the supporting cast that played those spirits; I also believe that they were good in their limited roles. Both, Carol Kane & David Johansen as the Ghost of Christmas Past & Present were wonderful. Even some of the acting in the non-supernatural roles, were fine, such as Karen Allen as Frank's love interest, Claire Phillips & Alfre Woodard as Grace Coolney, an employee for Frank. Even the cameos from Bill Murray's brothers, John, Joel and Brian were fine for the most part. As for the celebs cameos, such as Mary Lou Retton, Lee Majors, Paul Shaffer and others. They were also, nice to see. In the end, they all did their parts. Overall: I can't say, that this film is worth being a stocking stuffer. Don't get me wrong, it's watchable, but I seem better, holiday movies from Bill Murray, such as 1993's 'Groundhog Day'. In the end, like a blizzard on Christmas. It's a little too cold to play.

43,The-Sarkologist,A poor adaption of an over-rated novel,3,23 November 2013,"Scrooged is based on A Christmas Carol (or something like that) by Charles Dickens where uncle Scrooge, a miserly old man, is visited by a three ghosts, and shown how nasty he really is, and thus in the end he changes and becomes a nicer person. A sickly moral by an idealistic author who really couldn't get over the fact that his father was a mean and nasty old man.This movie has Bill Murry playing the Uncle Scrooge character who is actually a TV executive that is just as miserly. After treating everybody like dirt, he is visited by a grotty taxi-driver who is the ghost of Christmas past, a psychotic fairy who is the ghost of Christmas Present, and of course death.Though I liked the psychotic fairy, I really found that this movie was even more dull and boring that Ghostbusters and really couldn't wait for it to end. There was so much moralistic rubbish in this movie that it made me sick. It was like most people are sweet and innocent and don't deserve the rubbish that they get. Okay, Murry's character was a not a very nice person, but I simply did not like the fact that a character like his changes so quickly. Oh sure, it does happen, but this is a fantastic movie set in a fantasy world where everybody turns out to be good little boys and girls and to me that is just putrifying.The critics described this as being a dark, depressing movie with a tragically flawed character. Personally I thought this was a long, boring movie, with a pathetically created character. In the end, I wouldn't suggest anybody return to watching garbology such as this (with the exception of the psychotic fairy).",Scrooged

Maybe that's why this movie is one of the least known of Bill Murray's extensive filmography. In this case, the film traces back and updates the story ""A Christmas Carol,"" a timeless classic of every Christmas since Dickens wrote it.This time the protagonist is a media tycoon who mistreats all the people around him and is deeply materialistic. However, the intervention of three humorous spirits will change the way they are, giving the film a very emotional ending and giving Murray a beautiful and profound monologue. The film has a joke, but being black humor will certainly displease many people. Murray made an excellent interpretation, I can hardly think of an actor more suitable for that character. The remaining cast is limited to give him the indispensable support, giving Murray all the space needed to shine.",Scrooged

The past work of Dickens is a gloom reading, the future work of Zemeckis won't be lighter... In addition, if Murray has a few good lines, 99% of his time is being a really cold, totally acid, egocentric TV producer and that hurts!

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"An '80s Christmas classic, maybe, but vintage Bill Murray is the treasure",6,29 December 2016,"""Scrooged"" is one of the few '80s and early '90s Bill Murray films I didn't grow up with, but even as an outsider coming to the film nearly 30 years later, it's clearly vintage Murray and was obviously paved the way for ""Groundhog Day,"" one of my favorite films of all time.A take on Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" Murray stars as a selfish and soulless television executive who gets a slap in the face (literally, in several instances) from the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. No new revelations come out of this adaptation of the annual Yuletide cautionary tale, but it does hold up as a classic '80s slapstick interpretation.Murray has always done despicable characters in lovable ways and Frank Cross is no exception. He's hilariously smug and manages to wink directly at the camera without ever actually doing so, a rare gift among comedic actors. The character is downright lousy, but the clever way that the movie transitions to and especially from the ghost sequences allow us to have much-needed laughs at Frank's expense. The camera tricks and written physical humor that separate the real and ""ghost"" worlds are easily the highlight of the non-Murray aspects of the film. Director Richard Donner, hot off ""The Goonies"" and the first ""Lethal Weapon"" at this point in his career, shows a deft hand with comedy, but it's the fantastical elements of the movie that work the best. A creepy '80s fantasy-adventure vibe whenever the ghost sequences come about transforms the movie into something a little more magical.Although it could be funnier, the only true failing of ""Scrooged"" is that it butchers the classic redemptive arc of its main character. Writers Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue nail the cheeky, alternative riff on what's a rather prim and proper story, but Cross' transformation doesn't hit the emotional notes. Because Dickens' tale is one of the most formula-driven stories of all time, it's easy to spot how Cross will redeem himself well before it happens. That requires the components of the story that we don't know at the onset – who Cross is and to what lengths he's a mean person – to be stronger and draw us in. They don't. The movie gets lost in the comedy stylings of Bill Murray and never roots itself in the basic yet critical tenants of the ""Christmas Carol"" story. Although many scenes help humanize Frank, he doesn't change all that much until the end, and it falls flat because we don't believe it.""Scrooged"" (and ""Christmas Vacation"") will always have the market cornered on Christmas movies from the late '80s. Among that classification, it can be rightfully labeled a classic. But there are better Murray comedies and better comedies from that era period. That said, the way Murray's career dramatically changed at the turn of the century leaves films in which he played the comic lead all too few, and ""Scrooged"" is one of the few opportunities to treasure it.~Steven CThanks for reading!

50,southdavid,"""Which Flaw?""",7,4 December 2020,"Given how disappointing a number of revisited 80's film have been for me, I was delighted to see that one of my former favourites ""Scrooged"" has gotten even better with time.Embittered Television Network President Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is under pressure, trying to organise a live adaptation of A Christmas Carol to air on Christmas Eve. He's brutal on his fellow executives and a tyrant to his assistant Grace (Alfre Woodard). With the presentation looming, he's visited by the corpse of Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) his former boss who tells him that he'll be visited by three spirits, the Ghosts of Christmases past (David Johansen), present (Carol Kane) and future who'll show him the error of his Scrooge-like ways.""Scrooged"" is a film I watched many times as a kid. Looking back now, I can't imagine what I thought some of the comedy was about, I probably just liked the slapstick - but now I can appreciate a lot more of the jokes and bits that make up the film. The Karma Sutra Christmas gift and Bill Murray's Richard Burton impression are both gags that I've never have gotten before. There's a lot more going on in Murray's performance than I would have appreciated and so much of it, particularly in the earlier scenes made me laugh. The two ghosts that we see are excellent, Carol Kane's manic, violent (somewhat sexual) fairy and, if you would have put a gun to my head, I'd have said Gilbert Gottfried played the Taxi driving ghost of Christmas past, but it isn't - it's David Johansen from the New York Dolls, who pretty much steals the film from under Murray, which is never easy to do.Looking objectively, you can see that the film doesn't quite nail the landing though. His big gesture at the end shows that he's learned the error of his ways - but I'm not sure why that means that Karen Allen falls back into his arms after 15 years! Maybe if they'd broken up a couple of years ago, but 15! He doesn't really do enough to earn that. It gets less funny as the plot takes over towards the end and I too can't help but feel like there was a better, cleverer way to finish the film that doesn't just involve a monologue to camera.It remains great though, and one of the few Christmas films that are actually worth watching, even if it's not quite all it could be.",Scrooged

Woodward (Crooklyn) plays Frank's secretary, Grace Cooley who tries to spend time with her family, but works constantly, Allen (Starman) plays Frank's ex-girlfriend, Claire who helps the needy, Goldthwait (One Crazy Summer) plays exec, Elliot who gets fired by Frank, but tries to get even, the late, Mitchum (Cape Fear) plays Frank's head boss, Preston Rhinelander and Glover (Gremlins 2) plays Brice Cummings, Frank's new exec hired by Preston to direct their live TV special, ""Scrooge."" Soon, Frank gets a visit from his old boss & friend, Lew Hayward (Forsythe) telling him he's going to be visited by 3 spirits. When Frank meets ghosts of past (Johansen), present (Kane) & future, he begins to understand the true meaning of Christmas. Murray's brothers, Brian, Joel and John also appear. This is a good comedy take of the Dickens classic I've always enjoyed. It features a good cast, great score by Danny Elfman and neat effects.

Of course...without Lee Majors. lol.Among the many wonderful comedies starring Bill Murray, this one has to be one of my favorites. It's a rather irreverent remaking of the Dickinsian classic, ""A Christmas Carol,"" and is one of the best of Bill Murray's portrayals, in my opinion.This quirky, funny, and sometimes melancholy movie is quite entertaining, intelligently funny, and a must see for any fan of the original work which this movie parodies.Murray is a classic megalomaniac; a sycophantic, narcissistic, egocentric fool who manages, through his bastardization of the human condition, to rate the ""ghost of xmas past, present, and future"" treatment from the Powers That Be.Don't miss this wonderfully funny movie, especially around xmas time.

53,Polaris_DiB,"Yes yes yes, let's make foolishness and then claim that's the point",2,11 June 2007,"Okay, so here's the deal: a rich television executive learns that there's more to Christmas than ratings when he gets visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future, during a disgustingly reworked live televised version of A Christmas Carol. Once the executive (played by Bill Murray) gets a heart, so to speak, then it's time for everybody to feel better about the world and remember what Christmas is about, exactly.And just like most other ridiculous Christmas creations out there, it is itself a product of the very thing it claims to be warning against. Sure, Murray learns his lesson. Sure, sensationalist advertising-saturated promo creation is a Bad Thing (r)(tm). So why mix that message in with a big ol' dolloping of crude humor, sexual innuendo, and spastic cynicism? Oh, because it's ""making fun of all of that"". And selling it at the same time. Or something.Bill Murray also is at a career low here. I don't know how precisely he managed to do this, but his delivery in this film makes Groundhog Day seem like a bigger, more important holiday than Christmas. This is a vehicle of the worst sort: a movie meant to sell with star power, where the star basically plays himself, but the movie doesn't care enough about what it's doing to give the star any room to shine, and as a result the star just gets repetitive and obnoxious in his role. Probably the best example of this is the ""Oh, I get it now!"" monologue at the end, which never really says anything and keeps going on and on as Murray stumbles around throwing out ideas that are less revealing than the ones given to him in the spectral visits.By the time this movie ends, one can't help but anticipate the credits to see who's responsible for this stupidity. Surprisingly, it's Richard Donner, of Goonies and Superman II fame. Huh.--PolarisDiB",Scrooged
54,ianlouisiana,Never give a sucker an even break.,9,20 January 2007,"Bill Murray - the modern day W.C.Fields - cleverly creates a monster, one that is perfectly believable and even chillingly amusing in a savage way,then questions his creation,dismantles it,sets up its diametric opposite and leaves the audience wondering if the old version of himself wasn't perhaps a lot more interesting than the new supposedly ""improved"" one.Stella Stevens did something similar with Jerry Lewis in ""The Nutty Professor"" when she sneaked a bottle of the potion that turned Lewis the nerd into ""Buddy Love"" into his pocket at the end of the movie.In both movies the convention that kindness and good nature are to be preferred to smartarse arrogance is turned on its head. Certainly in ""Scrooged"" the first incarnation of Cross has all the best lines .Top TV executives are supposed to be like that,devoid of conscience and acid of tongue.If one was ever portrayed in any other way the box office would be besieged by people demanding their money back. It's a dog eat dog world and no doubt Cross's route to the top is strewn with the bloody carcasses of his rivals.""The night the reindeer died"" is the child of his genius,his legacy to future generations of TV execs to come. Mr Murray forces us to admire him for his chutzpah,laugh at him for his mordant wit but dislike him for his overwhelming selfishness and pity him for his lack of empathy of almost sociopathic proportions.Cross is one of the great monster creations in the movies. After his Damascene conversion he becomes just another nice guy, sensitive, generous,compassionate .Nice .........but dull. No more Mr Nasty Guy.Well,I know which Cross I preferred,and so,I suspect,would many of the audience. But this is a movie about Christmas or - to be more accurate - a movie about a TV show about Christmas,and it just happens to be set at Christ- -mas as well and the whole thing is based on a story about Christmas. So,despite having inherited Fields' ""anyone who hates children and animals can't be all bad"" persona,Mr Murray is all sweetness and light for the Capra - esquire ending,which,although true to the source material, doesn't really convince.

But then, terrorists, packing some serious heat with them, lay siege to the workshop.Panicking, Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the elves run towards the back of the shop, open a tool cabinet, which reveals an arsenal of M-16s, and soon everybody's armed to the hilt with automatic weaponry. But then Lee Majors appears on a snowmobile and reassures Santa that Christmas will be coming on time this year. Then Lee goes to work killing the terrorists with a large Gatling gun.Then we're treated to a promo spot for a television production of ""Scrooge,"" which features a bloody highway shooting, a plane blowing up, and drug addicts taking heroin. It is this sort of cynicism that's underlying in much of the subtext of this film, and it's also something that Frank Cross (Bill Murray), ""the youngest television president in network history,"" thrives on.And so opens ""Scrooged,"" director Richard Donner's contemporary take on Charles Dickens's classic tale ""A Christmas Carol."" Dickens's novel has been fodder for countless television, film, and stage productions over the 150+ years it has been an accepted part of American literature, and this 1988 dark comedy is the latest incarnation.The biggest reason it has is because it describes the need for mankind to not be so selfish, and it takes three ghastly apparitions over the course of a 24-hour period to show an old miser the error of his ways.But all of this is in the past. Cross is so swept up in himself, that he gives bath towels to everyone (even his only brother) on Christmas. He asks his loyal secretary Grace (Alfre Woodard) to stay late at work, despite the fact that she has to take her mute son to the doctor. (""I care!"" Frank says, when she confronts him about it.) He fires an underling named Eliot (Bobcat Goldthwait) for questioning him about his un-Christmas-like promo ads. He shuns Claire (Karen Allen), the only woman who's ever cared about him when she tries to provide comfort for the homeless. Yeah, Cross is every bit as a unsavory as most misers are when it comes to ""A Christmas Carol.""But life is about to change for Frank, and that's marked by the sudden and (literally) explosive appearance of the rotting corpse of his late boss. The walking, talking ""worm feast"" informs Frank that he's going to be visited by three ghosts over the next 24 hours, and this may be his last chance to change his ways. And from there on, it's ghastly, darkly comic hilarity as Frank goes back, forward, and stays in the present as three ghosts (a manic cabbie, a jilted, abusive fairy, and a towering, cloaked skeleton, respectively) take him on a wild ride through his life.Bill Murray is at his comic best here, getting ""Scrooged"" the way someone in his position should. Much like the lead character in ""A Christmas Carol"" realizes the error of his ways, Frank Cross does so too, but with a kind of cynicism that could only be provided by someone as indifferent, uncompromising, and selfish as him. And he's also quite aware from the appearance of the first ghost of what this trip entails.The makeup and special effects are also worthy of some mention. The ghosts all look fantastic, even though some would argue that the effects that brought them to life are dated; well, this movie was made in 1988 for crying out loud!I liked ""Scrooged,"" as it is certainly a fantastic Christmas movie to watch, and is quite funny, especially just to see Murray get his comeuppance in a role that seems to suit him perfectly.Watch Bill Murray get ""Scrooged"" - 10/10",Scrooged

It's a dark, biting and sarcastic take on the tale that's set firmly in the murk of the corporation-friendly '80s, but it completely falls apart on the back nine. The first act is an inspired lampoon of bad network television (and the bad network executives behind it) with Murray, deliciously sinister as the worst boss in America, at the height of his powers. It's when the narrative tries to cram in a tepid love story and a sudden, jolting redemption that the cornerstones begin to crumble.

Murray is OK in the role but he really can't carry the range of emotions necessary for us to really believe the story. In this version, he's a television network President who's been ding'd by Christmas pasts and has the ""bah humbug"" attitude towards the sacred day. He fires a worker who disagrees with his programming on Christmas with such unholy titles like ""The Day the reindeer died"", where Lee Majors saves santa and the elves with firepower. This over-the-top stuff is not appropriate, of course, and so the head gives him someone else to help him with the work. He then starts seeing the ghosts and they supposedly are trying to help him see things straight. Murray's character also has a love interest, played by Karen Allen(who does nothing more than show her big brown eyes), to give him more motivation --- I guess. The movie is funny in spots, especially when Carol Kane plays the present ghost as a nice girl with a heavy boot, but the movie doesn't push through to all-out comedy in much other places. It doesn't go towards all-out drama either, so the viewer really doesn't have much to hold onto.

Murray plays ad TV mogul Frank Cross with a bitter resentment that's just this side of mean, but that's always been his charm, blurring the lines between comedy and drama, seriousness and farce until we're not quite sure what kind of performance we're getting from him. Thrill follows the standard Dickens play by play, showing us a regressed, antisocial prick who gradually opens up over the course of one magical Christmas Eve, after being visited by three ghosts. The standout here is David Johansen as the Ghost Of Christmas Past, here manifested as a howling lunatic of a cab driver, a decrepit old ghouls that keeps Frank on his feet via manic energy for his segment of the film. Carol Kane will puzzle as the swooning, creepy Ghost Of Christmas Present, a doped out Tinkerbell in her twilight years. There's wicked fun from other actors including John Forsythe, John Glover, Karen Allen as Frank's old flame, and a nice Yuletide vibe that's only hampered by an extremely out of place third act monologue from Murray that feels forced, demented and uncomfortable, otherwise, solid holiday fun:)",Scrooged
61,davispittman,Unfunny,3,26 November 2015,"Scrooged is supposed a funny Christmas movie. The main problem with this flick is its unfunny in every way. Scrooged just isn't funny at all, and when that's the main selling point in a movie, when it doesn't deliver on it, it's kinda like, what else is there?? Bill Murray was alright as Scrooge, not awful or great. Carol Kane was actually pretty good in her role, she held her own well. The script is just so-so at best, nothing much to brag about on that account. There is some nice special effects in the movie, for 1988 that is. If you're looking for a nice family Christmas movie to sit down and watch, this might possibly be for you, it is PG-13, and it does have some language in it. You might could catch it on television when it's edited, ABC Family and AMC usually show it around Christmas time. But in my personal opinion, you can do a lot better. Scrooged is just boring and unfunny and not really sweet or heart warming at all. 3/10 for Scrooged",Scrooged
62,slokes,He's Got A Weird Feeling About Tonight...,8,24 December 2007,"Bill Murray's high reputation is based on other performances, but it seems a shame to overlook his work in this sentimental yet hilarious take-off on the classic Charles Dickens Christmas tale, repurposed for the world of mass media, circa the 1980s.Murray is the Scrooge-like Frank Cross, programming chief for the IBC network and a man so mean he would fire a junior executive on Christmas Eve, scare an old lady to death with a vicious TV promo (which he then milks for publicity), and worst of all, tell a stagehand to staple antlers on a little mouse. All this means he is due for a visit by three ghosts, bent on showing him the error of his ways. But is Cross too cynical even for them?Funny how things work out. Murray was reportedly unhappy with ""Scrooged"", as was director Richard Donner and co-screenwriter Michael O'Donoghue, one of ""Saturday Night Live""'s darkest and most legendary figures. Yet maybe because of the behind-the-scenes turmoil, including a release date so delayed two principal cast members were already dead when it came out, ""Scrooged"" works beautifully as one of filmdom's strangest salutes to the Christmas spirit.What's great about ""Scrooged""? You have to start with Murray, who nails Cross with a combination of sneering sarcasm and bitter one-liners. Even when his old boss, Lew Hayward (John Forsyth), strolls into his office seven years after suffering a fatal heart attack, Cross doesn't budge.""Gah, has it been that long?"" Cross says. ""To look at you, I wouldn't have guessed more than three, tops.""Forsyth's funnier than I've ever seen him, but the ace make-up job alerts you to the fact this is one ""Christmas Carol"" remake that's playing for serious stakes. One reason I think the film failed to find greater popularity is it confused people expecting a Yuletide ""Ghostbusters"" to see Murray stuck inside a coffin, begging to live.But for those who stick with it, and allow for the off-chance that through its bizzaro comedy it may strike the odd chord, ""Scrooged"" works terrifically well at challenging us about how cynicism and despair are ruts one needs to kick oneself out of, and that life in the end may boil down to something as simple as ""put a little love in your heart.""That's why the ending works so well for me, because it really does much the same thing Dickens did 150 years ago, risking a little strenuousness for the sake of a message about self-betterment. It's especially striking when one considers O'Donoghue's normal family sensibilities ran along the lines of promo announcements for shows like ""The Waltons Eat Their Young.""You get similar promo comedy at the start of ""Scrooged"", along with Robert Mitchum as the network boss who counsels Frank about strategic programming for cats: ""What about a cop that dangles string?"" I think O'Donoghue enjoyed the television satire especially, though he may indulge himself a little too much at the expense of a network censor.Carol Kane and David Johansen shine as two of the Christmas spirits, while Karen Allen adds a lot of heart as the girl Cross left behind on his road to success. The film is shambolic, cluttered, and a lot of jokes fall flat, but there are a lot of other jokes that score, as well as an underlying message to exterminate the humbug in the hardest of hearts.For some, ""A Christmas Story"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" may be an annual event, but for me, there can be no seasonal substitute for the twisted Chrismas carol that is ""Scrooged.""",Scrooged

But all is not lost, as Frank is soon visited by three ghosts.Bill Murray and the supporting cast are only reasonable, with Bobcat Goldthwaite (""Police Academy"") being a very funny exception.

That may be controversial and I know that there will be friends on Facebook that will disagree with me wholeheartedly (Why am I friends with them?), but it just seems like Bill Murray spends two hours shouting and being silly, with equally annoying people!
Thank God for Karen Allen, the only sane, normal seeming character throughout. Although, believe it or not, even Bobcat Goldthwaite is more appealing in this one.It's a nasty and grimey interpretation of my favourite book and many classic films before and after it and I just think it is unnecessary and misses the point that the story tries to make. The last ten minutes is actually quite painful to watch as Murray attempts to make good, but just blabs incoherent nonsense to the camera.He is too extreme and the second ghost is soooo stupid it was cringey.I must not watch this film again!",Scrooged
65,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It's adequate for what it wants to get across,6,21 December 2015,"For a person like Richard Donner, it would seem difficult to make a film that rides close to the middle of being just okay. Considering he's only directed a handful of films of which many of them gained lots of praise or went on to be cult films, it's surprising when moments like these happen. Richard Donner headed Superman (1978), The Goonies (1985) and Lethal Weapon (1987). So for this, it's even more confusing when a well- respected director is paired up with decent writers and a cast of good actors. For comedy legend like Bill Murray, being in popular movies like Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981) and of course Ghost Busters (1984), how can a pairing create an output so okay-ish feeling? It may be hard to believe but it is in fact a film that's better than average but only marginally. Apparently it was reported that Bill Murray and Richard Donner did not get along during production either so this could be why. Things could have always been worse though I guess.The film screenplay is another alteration of the classic Charles Dickens story of the Christmas Carol. Here Murray plays Frank Cross, the head chair of a major TV studio that loves finding and attracting any viewer they can find. Until on the night of Christmas Eve, Cross will be given a chance to redeem himself as a better person. Written by Michael O'Donoghue (an SNL writer) and Mitch Glazer (probably his best known writing credit), the script to this holiday comedy can be hit and miss. For example, the studio will do anything it can to make sure its the hottest thing being watched, whether its making parody films of classic Christmas tales, straight out desecrating them or even making channel programs that appeal to cat and dog viewers. It's a bit of stretch there, especially the last one. A lot of these incidents feel over exaggerated and feels forced on the audience like they're supposed to believe that people would accept such things and find it believable.What is a nice change of pace is Richard Donner's directing skills. The story execution is fairly predictable but there are some various changes to the script that make it feel like effort was put in to make sure it doesn't feel like an exact copy. Much of this is due to the supporting cast being so helpful in their comedic timing and how they knock up Murray's character. John Forsythe as Cross' dead business partner has possibly the best introduction than any other ghost who visits him. David Johansen as the taxi driving ghost of Christmas past is the second best character with his no-cares given attitude. Perhaps the ghost who gets the cutest and most violent personality is Carol Kane as the ghost of Christmas present. There's also characters played by Karen Allen (Cross' ex), Bobcat Goldthwait (the voice of XL from Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000)), Robert Mitchum, Michael J. Pollard and Alfre Woodard playing a Bob Cratchet-like role. Then there's Bill Murray who is surprisingly the exact opposite.It's not that he is unfunny because there are occasional scenes that do produce a laugh, but the problem is he produces the least amount. Yes, Cross is supposed to be unfeeling but even unfeeling characters can have some kind of charm; but Murray doesn't pull it off. It's more obnoxious than charming. Another problem in the script is sometimes the story will spin off the main focus from Cross' development as a character and just wonder back into his reality to do whatever. It's distracting. Back to positives though, a visual element that works in this films favor are the special / practical effects. The special makeup effects creator / designers behind those scenes were Thomas R. Burman and Bari Dreiband- Burman (The Goonies (1985)& Die Hard 2 (1990)). There's also special effects supervisor Eric Brevig (Total Recall (1990), Hook (1991) and Men in Black (1997)) who shows that even before big Hollywood blockbusters he still had the talent needed to make things look good.Thankfully another visual treat is Michael Chapman's cinematography. Chapman is also the cameraman for Taxi Driver (1976), Ghost Busters II (1989), Space Jam (1996) and Six Days, Seven Nights (1998) all of which had decent lighting and steady movement. Also Chapman's work mixes evenly with whatever special or practical effects were put to screen. Lastly is Danny Elfman's score to the film that oddly enough sounds like a precursor to his future score for The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993). Sadly though, his score here feels underdeveloped. It is clear that its Elfman's signature theme with chanting choirs in a minor key, but after the title card appears it disappears for quite a long time. Then out of nowhere it rears its head and then abruptly vanishes again. Viewing Lala Land records website, it seems like there was a lot of material that wasn't used. It's also a shame when not even the original composition is that prevalent in the final product. What gives post production? Either way, when heard it is enjoyable.This holiday comedy does have some unique mutations with its direction in the script, but it also suffers from its main lead (Bill Murray) not being that funny and the main story sometimes jumping around. Thankfully the camera-work is able, the creature effects are well crafted, the music (although not abundant) is appropriate and the supporting cast adding to the laughs.",Scrooged
66,Kingslaay,Average,6,1 October 2021,Quite a steady and uninspired film in my opinion. Despite the praise that is dumped on Bill Murray I find him unimpressive once again in this slow film that has a weak payoff. Not even the magic of Christmas carries it.,Scrooged
67,PredragReviews,"""It's a bone, you lucky dog!""",8,22 May 2016,"Yes, Bill Murray pretty much plays himself in this one. Yes, the ending is too sentimental in a way that only Americans can do. No, it doesn't matter. Dickens's story never fails to engage. The relocation of the action to 1980's New York with a curmudgeonly TV exec' in the lead role works really well. The ghosts are refreshingly different with the exception of Christmas yet-to-be who probably only ever really works as a faceless shrouded figure. Dickens' tale is so well known that almost everyone knows the beats that the film follows; ex-partner, ghost of past, present and future. Where many artistic types mix things up is by changing the setting. 'Scrooged' is one of the best examples of this and Murray's loathsome TV Exec is a perfect 80's Scrooge. He is inherently mean, but he also revels in it giving him an even worse side than most portrayals of the part. The film has dated extremely since release, but that is part of the charm. Whilst the traditional Victorian tale is snow covered and whimsical, 'Scrooged' will be forever shoulder pads and giant hair.At the center of the film is a great performance by Murray, he really sells the role of a scumbag who finds a heart. The rest of the cast is less notable; Bobcat Goldthwait and Karen Allen are two actors who did not work that much after. If the film is not Murray's, it is director Richard Donner's. Donner is one of the quintessential 80's directors and he fills the film with 80's tropes; ghoulish effects and great pop music. The ghosts are more gruesome than in most revelings of the story and that makes 'Scrooged' a more adult affair, but for all its 80's facade, the film works so well because it stays true to the core messages in Dickens' work.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Scrooged

Franks idea of Christmas programming is basically putting the Manson Family on Television if it will get ratings. Of course he learns to take in the joy of the season by the end of the movie but the film makers themselves failed to infuse the story of heart.

Carol Kane, as always, steals the show as a feisty fairy with a chip on her shoulder as ""The Ghost of Christmas Present"". That creepy David Johansen as the cab-driving ""Christmas Past"". A video-tubed Giant-Muppet-sized creepy ""Christmas Future"". Karen Allen is the long-suffering love interest. A ridiculous sub-plot of the most garish, oddball, TV version of ""Scrooge live"" with Mary Lou Retton as an acrobatic ""Tiny Tim"" and a surprisingly good (yet funny) Buddy Hackett as Bob Cratchit. The solid Gold Dancers as ""The ""Scroogettes"". So much going on. Murray is pursued by Bobcat Goldwaithe as an armed disgruntled ex-employee. Does it all work? Partially. So many good and bad cameos, including Michael J. Pollard. Younger viewers might not recognize them all. An over-the-top ending that you will either love or hate, as Frank Cross (Bill Murray) give the most sincere or insincere performance of his life as he ""stops the live show in it's tracks"" with his apology to all. You will enjoy it more if you are a Bill Murray fan. It holds up quite well, being almost 30-years- old! Fun for all but a very strange version of ""Scrooge""!

72,Sirus_the_Virus,Perhaps my favorite Christmas film.,10,28 November 2009,"Bill Murray gets a Scrooge treatment in Scrooged, my favorite(perhaps favorite)Christmas movie. This film makes me laugh so hard every time. Not that many movie do that. If I watch a movie by myself, I don't really laugh that much. But if I am with someone else, I laugh incredibly hard unless the movie just ain't funny. With Scrooged, I laugh anyways.Bill Murray stars as Frank Cross, a Scrooge like television executive that is visited by three ghosts on Christmas eve. Wow doesn't that sound familiar? Frank is shown his past, involving him as a child and him when he was in love with Claire(Karen Allen). The present in which he sends his brother a DVD player that he didn't even buy. And future, in which, well, you have all either read or seen one of the hundred adaptations of Dicken's classic. You can figure out the last one.Bill Murray is fantastic as The Scrooge like character. Perhaps my favorite line of his when he is talking to his old boss. His boss is telling him about the three ghosts and Murray says""Let see if I can squeeze you in for a breakfast"". I don't know why but I love that line.Murray and other funny moments really make this movie for me. Murray is one funny guy, as we have all seen him in things such as Groundhog day. I am sure we all already knew that. Scrooged is perhaps my favorite Chriatmas film ever. I don't exactly know. I am still up in the air about that.",Scrooged
73,IonicBreezeMachine,"Strong laughs to be had, but also an undercurrent of bitterness and cruelty.",6,18 November 2020,"Frank Cross (Bill Murray) in the president of TV network IBC. Frank delights in firing executive Eliot Loudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait) for disagreeing with him, and also casually overworks and underpays his assistant Grace Cooley (Alfre Woodard). However when the ghost of his deceased friend and mentor, Lew Hayward (John Forsythe), visits him to warn him of the fate that awaits him when he dies, Frank is given a chance at redemption by way of three ghostly visitations.Released in 1988 to healthy box office and mixed to positive reviews, the movie was anticipated as Murray's comeback after taking a four year hiatus due to the success of Ghostbusters and the commercial and critical failure of The Razor's Edge. The movie is a contemporary take on A Christmas Carol while also being a satire of network TV, and while the humor is certainly on point, its take on A Christmas Carol is somewhat more mixed.The biggest issue with Scrooged story wise is in how it rearranges the elements into ways that seem almost at odds with one another. While Murray's ""scrooge"" role as a brash cynical network executive is a decent update to the material to transition the narrative to contemporary times, other elements seem like they were done for the sake of being done without actually examining their overall impact story wise. Bob Cratchitt has been split into two characters, Grace Cooley and Eliot Loudermilk, and while the movie plays Grace's scenes of struggle for pathos, Elliot's scenes are played for laughs as we see his life fall apart and he's fired, living on the street, and abandoned by his family. The scenes of Eliot being abused and humiliated aren't funny and just feel bitter and pointlessly cruel.Other updates to the source material include an expansion of the Belle character, in this case Claire Phillips played by Karen Allen. The movie expands her role so that not only was she a figure of importance in Frank's past, but now serves as a secondary story thread wherein we're supposed to be invested in Frank getting back together with her. Karen Allen is really good in the role as Claire and is a wonderful actress as seen in her work in Starman and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but I didn't feel like the character would have ANY inclination to get back together with Frank and while I like the scenes she and Murray have in the past, that's where their relationship should've stayed as the present attempts for them to reconnect feel hollow and false.Despite my misgivings with the approach to plot and character Scrooged takes. one can't fault it for its satiric bite and genuinely clever take on network TV. The opening TV promos are very funny and feature humorous cameos by people such as Lee Majors and Robert Goulet in very bizarre and confused promos for Holiday specials that I won't dare spoil. There's also some very funny supporting work in the three ghosts. David Johansen of the New York Dolls plays the Ghost of Christmas Past as a sleazy cab driver, and is an absolute scene stealer with his performance even when sharing the screen with Murray. His takedowns of Frank's ego and self assuredness are an absolute delight and he's easily my favorite part of the movie. Carol Kane is also good playing Ghost of Christmas Present, and while Kane sometimes flirted with becoming overbearing, I felt she brought great comic energy to her manic mischievous pixie persona that annoys Frank to no end.Scrooged is a movie I've a complicated relationship with. I saw this movie as a kid and enjoyed watching it around the Holidays. I still sometimes even pop it in just for nostalgia's sake. But I can't deny the faults it has. The movie's too cynical to work as A Christmas Carol adaptation, and it's also too sentimental to go all the way with its satire. I acknowledge the craft and effort that clearly went into Scrooged, and the overall idea is certainly not a bad one, but the execution with the material leaves me only half heartedly recommending it.",Scrooged
74,mentalcritic,Shares its flaws with its source material...,7,5 November 2004,"One of the major problems with adopting Dickens' Christmas Carol into a modern format is that Dickens' verse was written in a very different time, when idealists had very different cultural values. When Dickens wrote the material on which this is based, either the world wasn't as overpopulated as it is today, or people weren't aware of it. Whichever option you prefer, painting people who prefer to place their financial independence over the seeming obligation to breed or marry as empty, soulless ne'er-do-wells was acceptable in those days.Unfortunately for Scrooged, this is not the nineteenth century, and the cultural values of today could not be more different. The world is overflowing with starving people, and speculation is rampant that we don't have the resources for our society to survive another century. To push the kind of values or ideals that Dickens' original story represents, as far as I am concerned, is offensive. I bet Dickens would be utterly modified to hear that I refuse to have children until science is advanced enough that I can edit diseases that run in my family, diabetes being the number one choice, out of their genetic structure.Where Scrooged rescues itself, however, is in the acting. Bill Murray seems to be having the time of his life playing the modern Ebeneezer. In some scenes, he takes hammy overacting to a typically Murray-esque level. When he's confronted by the Christmas ghosts, on the other hand, he plays some of it so deadpan that it adds to the hilarity. Bob Goldthwait gets a brilliant cameo as the just-sacked employee. He's still squealing and almost screaming, but by his standards, this is a refreshingly restrained performance.Another problem with the film is that there seem to be a lot of missed opportunities. The script just seems to play everything not for laughs so much as to get from one scene to the next. Which is a big shame, as the material had so much potential for comedy, especially given its cast. A few wisecracks from Murray is simply not enough effort. Especially not compared to some of the sight gags from previous gems on Murray's resumé. Even Police Academy 4 was funnier overall than this pedestrian exercise, in spite of being made for less than a quarter of the money, and with considerably more questionable talent at that.If you're going to see Scrooged, see it for one reason. Bill Murray's performance is the rock upon which this entire comedy rests. His performance during his meeting with the ghost of Christmas Future, as one-sided as it is, makes one wonder how Bill Murray would perform a meeting with Terry Pratchett's Death. Karen Allen gets a turn here as the obligatory overstated love interest, and she does alright with what she is given. Unfortunately, her character is so underwritten that she only serves as a plot device, which serves to make point one (the ""get yeself hitcheded now, mister"" message) all the more aggravating.I gave Scrooged a seven out of ten. This score contains two bonus points for Bill Murray, and one for Bob Goldthwait. If it weren't for these two taking turns at injecting some genuine comedy, Scrooged would be very difficult to watch.",Scrooged
75,ODDBear,This is no humbug,8,14 December 2009,"On occasions I find myself in the minority and that is the case with this holiday classic. Apparently not too many people in my humble circle of friends even like this film.

It's all here; The Ghost of Christmas Past, of Christmas Present and Future as Murray is shown the true meaning of Christmas and the importance of being a decent human being.I suppose if you don't like Bill Murray then you won't like the film. He's in every frame here and his over-the-top performance is what makes or breaks this film. I love his sarcastic delivery of witty one-liners and, ironically, my favorite parts are when he's at his nastiest (the bit with the old woman and the cab is priceless).The message here is timeless and always leaves me with a warm feeling in my heart.

77,jhclues,Entertaining Take On A Familiar Story,8,6 December 2000,"Bill Murray lends his comedic talents to this contemporary version of the Dickens' classic `A Christmas Carol,' with somewhat skewered results in `Scrooged,' directed by Richard Donner from a screenplay by Mitch Glazer and Michael O' Donoghue.  This time around, Ebenezer is one Frank Cross (Murray), programming executive for a major television network with an office in New York.  Above all else, Cross covets the `ratings' he can add to his coffers, and this year he's going all out with a `live' broadcast of `A Christmas Carol' planned for Christmas Eve, starring Buddy Hackett as Scrooge and Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.  And that's just a taste of the kind of humor this film has to offer.  There's more, much more, and it's all handled with aplomb by Donner, Murray and a great supporting cast. 	Whatever genre he's working in, Donner knows his stuff and knows how to deliver the goods.  Here he wisely lets Murray lead the way, but keeps his star on task and the film moving along with a tempered pace and great timing.  The story remains the same, but placing Scrooge-- Cross-- in the entertainment industry was a stroke of genius, and it all works exceedingly well, as it gives the audience a medium with which it can readily identify. Let's face it, television is a part of our culture, like it or not, and it's here to stay; and in this instance, using it as a setting for this story offers a `tableau vivant' rich with possibilities that are tapped to the fullest.  There's a promo for the upcoming live broadcast like you've never seen before; there's the `inside' industry jokes, like Network executive Preston Rhinelander (Robert Mitchum) urging programming for cats; `Marley's ghost' becomes Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) the exec who sold his soul for ratings; the casting of Hackett and Retton; but most of all, it puts Murray right in his element. 	Murray gets right to the heart of the character, imbuing Cross with a sense of jaded, dubious and sarcastic paranoia that so perfectly fits the psychological make-up of an executive in a business where you're only as good as yesterday's ratings.  And Murray plays him to the hilts; he has the tone and the body language, and nobody can look `askance' like he can, a nuance he makes the most of here.  it's an original take on a familiar character, and in Murray's skin Cross becomes a memorable and entirely believable figure, from his credible ruthlessness (he fires an underling, Eliot Loudermilk--played by Bob Goldthwait-- just before Christmas for disagreeing with his `vision') to his epiphany on Christmas Eve. 	The terrific supporting cast includes Karen Allen as Claire, the girl Frank lets slip away as he follows the siren's song of career; John Glover (Bryce Cummings) as Frank's new `assistant,' plotting his way to the top; Alfre Woodard (Grace) as Frank's secretary, a single mom with a sick child; Michael J. Pollard (Herman); Nicholas Phillips (Calvin); John Murray (James); Brian Doyle-Murray (Earl Cross); David Johansen, as the cab-driving Ghost of Christmas Past; and Carol Kane, who turns in an unforgettable, hilarious, scene-stealing  performance as the Ghost of Christmas Present. There's plenty of laughs and some touching moments in `Scrooged,' which is a wonderfully entertaining holiday treat, especially if you want your `Christmas Carol' served up just a little bit differently this year.  And the speech Murray gives at the end, once he's had his revelation, is worth the price of admission alone; it's one of those things Murray does best, and he really connects with the audience, especially when he finishes up by leading everyone involved (including the audience) in song.  This is a movie that has become an annual event for many since it's arrival on video;  give yourself a present this year and put this one under your tree.  You'll be glad you did.  Like the song at the end (sung by Annie Lennox and Al Green), it'll `Put A Little Love In Your Heart.'  I rate this one 8/10.",Scrooged
78,Mister-6,We wish you a not-very Merry Christmas...,2,30 August 2000,"There were three things about ""Scrooged"" that drew me to the theatre during its initial run: it had Bill Murray after an extended time-off from films, the basic ""A Christmas Carol"" story and...it was a comedy.  Like I said, that's what drew me.Now all I can say is: people, learn from my mistakes and DON'T WATCH ""SCROOGED""!To say that Murray is wrong in his part as network head honcho Frank Cross isn't comment enough - he approaches it as if he was right in the middle of something important and wants to hurry back to it.  He's mean, nasty, irritable, cranky, foul-natured, hostile, violent and disrepectful. Usually, those are positive qualities in his movies, but here they are not. Everyone he is in the same frame with seems to consider him like that passenger in coach who complains about everything, yells at the stewardesses and hasn't bathed in a week.  Maybe they're right, I dunno.Then there's the tone of the story - does it want to be a parody of ""A Christmas Carol"" or a retelling?  It fails at both because they never find a consistent tone and stick with it.  It's slapstick, then it's maudlin; it's satire, then it's love story; it's sentiment then everyone breaks into song. WHAT THE...??!  If the film-makers weren't sure about how to make the film, how should we know how to take it?And finally, there's the wisdom of a ""comedy"" where a child is struck mute after his father is killed, a homeless person freezes to death and an old lady dies of a heart attack after watching one of Cross' (Murray's) paranoia-driven commercials for his network's production of ""Scrooge"".  This is a holiday comedy?  I haven't even mentioned the part where he steals another woman's taxi then flips her off as he rides away.  Ho ho ho.This is about the most depressing holiday movie I've ever seen; enough to put you off your egg nog.  Any good parts?  Well - Forsythe in the Jacob Marley part has a good first scene, Allen is radiance and light as an old girlfriend who loves her ""Lumpy"", and Kane is a fantastic Ghost of Christmas Present by the sole virtue that she gets to beat the holy beans out of Murray with her fists, uppercuts him with a toaster, knocks him down a flight of stairs, slaps him, electrically zaps his ears, plants a nice firm kick right where you'd expect and tries to rip his bottom lip off.  God, I love that woman.Other than that, nothing.  Not a thing that celebrates the season, goodwill, peace, love, charity, the Christmas spirit, and not one mention of the original source material: Dickens NEVER wrote a story called ""Scrooge"".BTW, wasn't there a musical made with Albert Finney called ""Scrooge""?  Maybe they missed a good bet, here.Two stars only for ""Scrooged"" - one for Murray (he's worth one, anyway) and another for ""Robert Goulet's Down-Home Cajun Christmas Special"".  Now THAT I'd like to see.",Scrooged
79,Hollywood_Yoda,American Update of Dickens English Classic,9,6 November 2006,"In this update of Charles Dickens' classic tale of Christmas, we see Bill Murray playing the part of Frank (a.k.a. Scrooge), and the twists only begin there. He is the executive of a television station whose only goal is to collect money, the same way Scrooge did. And this Christmas, he plans on airing some unique shows for the holidays, and even expects his employees to work on Christmas Eve.The traditional happens though, the three ghosts come to see Frank, and show him the world of the Past, Present, and Future (just not the traditional way, of course). This is a great holiday film for those that enjoy comedies, and those that love Bill Murray.I give it 9 out of 10.

80,gab-14712,Bill Murray At His Scathing Best!,8,11 November 2021,"Bill Murray's Scrooged is...good enough. It does not quite reach the heights of ""holiday classic that needs to be re-watched every single year,"" but it does pass for an enjoyable, nontraditional take of the famed Dickens's A Christmas Carol. The first hour is when the movie is at its best with Murray channeling his inner Scrooge to delightful results. From there, it does lose a bit of its footing when more sentimentality is added. The whole speech at the end, while its heart is in its right place, seems a little misplaced. Regardless, there is enough here to like. If anything, it is not a traditional retelling...it is a unique story. The story within the story if that makes any sense. In addition to being a holiday movie, this stands as a scathing indictment of the entertainment industry. More than thirty years after the film was released, I see parallels within this industry. Some things never change.After four years in semi-retirement, Bill Murray returned to the world of acting. Ghostbusters tired him out and took a nice break. I find it interesting that this film's tagline mentioned three ghosts instead of one ghost alluding to Murray's 1984 blockbuster. Sadly, this film had all sorts of production trouble. Murray felt he was rusty when it came to his acting skills, and often butted heads with director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon, The Goonies). Donner wanted the movie to be louder, louder, and even more louder. Essentially, Murray and Donner had different ideas how the film was to be. The screenwriters were even more angry about the final product. Michael O'Donoghue forever denounced the film. He called his original script a holiday version of It Happened One Night but ultimately most of the script was not used. Despite the calamitous production, this became a cult classic. I certainly enjoyed it to a degree, even if I do not wholeheartedly agree with how the film ended.Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is the obnoxious and downright miserable president of IFC. His latest project is to create a live adaptation of A Christmas Carol for his network. Of course, he makes everyone's life miserable on set including his secretary, Grace Cooley (Alfre Woodward). The network's CEO, Preston Rhinelander (Robert Mitchum) senses something is wrong and hires this gnarly outsider executive, Brice (John Glover) to ""help."" Now, Frank is about to have his own Dickens moment when he is visited by the three ghosts to show him the meaning of his life. My favorite spirit? The Ghost of Christmas Present (played magnificently by Carol Kane). Loved how she kept physically abusing Murray with her wings.People gave Murray lots of trouble for his performance. Personally, I thought he was great throughout. Even when he becomes a better person, he still did great. The first hour is at his unhinged best when he uses dark humor to great effect. Carol Kane was my favorite ghost as she knocked it out of the part. Karen Allen was good, but not sure if I truly believed her romance with Murray. Mitchum and Glover made a fine pair, but their roles could have been expanded upon. Still, this is a great cast, and it was fun to see everyone in this kind of movie.Overall, Scrooged is a decent holiday movie. It is neither Donner's nor Murray's best, but still should be given a chance. The dark humor will certainly turn some people off, but Murray's deadpan was perfect for the type of humor. Yeah, it can go into mean-spirited mode at times before the sentimentality seeps in. Sadly, I can relate that to a world we live in today. Everyone seems to be channeling their inner Scrooge. The ending is somewhat weak but could have been worse I suppose. Another good thing? The soundtrack! Led by songs from Annie Lennox, at least the film gave us some good songs to add to our holiday collection.My Grade: B.",Scrooged
81,ajs-10,Not as good as it used to be...,6,30 December 2010,"Back in my youth I used to love this film, it had such great comic moments for me and I loved watching it every chance I got. It has now been quite a number of years since I last saw it and it seems I've changed my view somewhat. I'm not sure if it's because I've got older (& wiser), or it's because it has become dated, but I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as I used to. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please find a humane way of fitting those tiny antlers to that mouse thank you).Frank Cross is a young and ambitious TV executive. He has risen through the ranks to the position of President of the Network at the expense of his relationships with his family and his girl, Claire Phillips. They are to put on a live production of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', but they call it 'Scrooge' for some reason. This means everyone has to work on Christmas Eve... Not popular as you might guess. When Frank is visited by the ghost of his former boss, he is told he must change his ways. To this end he will be visited by three ghosts. These ghosts, The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future show Frank the error of his ways But it's up to him to change.Although it's a pretty well produced film I did find it a little dated by today's standards. Yes, Bill Murray really pulled them in back in the day, but today I find him a little bit irritating. Having said that, he played the part of Frank Cross with great professionalism. It was the actors in the smaller parts I found more interesting; Carol Kane really gave her all as the Ghost of Christmas Present, Bobcat Goldthwait was great (as ever) as the unfortunate Eliot Loudermilk and it as nice to see Robert Mitchum as Studio owner, Preston Rhinelander. Oh, and I should also give an honourable mention to Karen Allen as Claire Phillips.I think part of the problem I have with this film is the Frank Cross character is so obnoxious that I find it really hard to have any empathy for him when he finally has his revelation. Maybe they took it a bit too far (for me), but having said that, there is still something about this film or am I reliving my youth again? Still, it's a bit of Christmas fun, if a little dated, so, recommended but only if you're in the mood.My score: 6.2/10",Scrooged
82,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,9,21 December 2014,"The success and wealth of being a television programming executive has made Frank Cross (Murray) cold-hearted, cruel and cynical greedy enough to head up a live Christmas Eve broadcast of A Christmas CAROL (referred to as SCROOGE), only to find his life hilariously mirroring the story he's producing. Add this one to the Holiday watch list, because despite its imperfections, it remains hilarious, entertaining and touching throughout the years.

When he fires one of his people on the day before Christmas (it's Zed from the Police Academy!) the now well-known ghosts step in to show Cross what life is really about.As I said, Murray is great and some jokes work pretty well, but too bad about the ending (too moral) and some lulls here and there.

Ewwwww.Karen Allen and Alfre Woodward are both such beautiful people--- hot babes, of course, but also fine spirited and good hearted folks. What were they doing in this disaster?

85,Movie-12,One of the best holiday comedies ever. Very funny. **** out of ****,10,18 December 1999,"SCROOGED (1988) ****Starring: Bill Murray, Karen Allen, John Glover, John Forsythe, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, David Johansen, and Alfre Woodard Director: Richard Donner   Running time: 101 minutes    Rated PG-13 (for violence, language, and sexual references)By Blake French:	""Scrooged"" is one of the top ten holiday comedies ever produced on the big screen. It enables a viewer to experience the true meaning of cinema: to jump out of our lives and experience another. Once in a long, long while we get a movie with as much magically irrelevant context as Richard Donnar's 1988 adaptation of Charles Dickens classic fable. ""Scrooged"" holds a place on my list of the top 100 American movies ever made.	The film takes place a few days before Christmas. Bill Murray stars as the heartless  Frank Cross, a corporate tightwad in charge of a highly profitable television company. This man seldom gives raises,  airs stomach churning TV ads, and fires desperate employees at the drop of a hat, regardless of what time of year it is. Currently, Frank's company is producing the first live Christmas program on network television, on Christmas eve. It is a Charles Dickens fable. Frank is at the prime of his life, living a wealthy, glamorous, but unhappy life.	His greed soon catches up with him, however, when one night his old boss visits him, who has now been dead for years. Frank is at first astonished; he thinks he is hallucinating. The talking corpse tells him that  very soon he will be introduced to three ghosts involuntarily. Franks then calls his old girlfriend, and continues on with his deprived life.Bill Murray plays his role straight, with intensity and imagination--just like everyone else in the cast. He acts like he is yelling at his workers, and they act like they are being yelled at. This is what generates the film all of its laughs. It takes the characters seriously, and the comical situations in which they are placed are what makes the film funny.	Each of the three ghosts visit Frank. They include The Ghost of Christmas past, a rough cigar smoking taxi driver, an angelic but brutal pink fairy, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the most feared ghost, Christmas Future, the death-resembling, dark capped figure. They each contribute a heartfelt, terrifying message to Frank, explaining to him how that he either needs to clean up his act and become a giving, generous man, or dastardly things will happen to him.   	The three ghosts are some of the most memorable characters ever seen in the movies. The human characters are also very interesting and entertaining. The filmmakers write each with distributive characteristics, provoking empathy and captivation. They are wonderfully portrayed as well.	The interlocking stories each related to each other in Richard Donnar's comedy classic as well. Each scene relates to the next with a strong, supportive narrative through line through Frank Cross.	''Scrooged'' definitely fits into the comedy genre, and offers copious amounts of laugh out loud material. There's even dialogue and sight gags that provoke laughter. On the other hand, the film doesn't lose track of its message by being all over the wall slapstick silliness. It leaves room for the emotions and feelings present. For this type of comedy to work, the humor needs to be played accurately. Some scenes involving the past of Frank are quite emotional, and the filmmakers use this to their advantage to develop the Frank character even further. ''Scrooged'' may be a spoof, but if still holds true to the classic story it is based on.	I also enjoyed the illustrious style this film uses: a mesmerizing blend of perfect set direction and colorful atmosphere. The sound track is very effective as well, with memorable tunes and voiceless medleys.  The closing scene of ''Scrooged'' may feel a bit contrived and fake, but it also allows us to leave the theater with joyful happiness inside. If this film doesn't put you in the Christmas spirit, nothing will.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.",Scrooged
86,caa821,Fits well with other Christmas flicks,8,16 December 2006,"During the Christmas season, it's impossible not to see a host of many stories of two individuals either ""coming together"" for the first time, or re-kindling a relationship in need of same. One also will see many reincarnations of ""A Christmas Carol,"" with Scrooges from long ago and more recent times.This provides a variation of the latter, with a decided edge, and also presents the former in the same fashion.Bill Murray, as usual, is frequently ""over the top,"" sometimes a little more so than may seem necessary - but that's his style and we expect it. John Glover is superb in his smarmy role, and plays the ""horse's ass"" about as well as anyone on film.The numerous supporting characters, both in the main story and as characters within the t.v. production ""story-within-a-story,"" are all excellent as well, and present an interesting, varied and talented cast.With the expansion of cable and satellite, and both studio- and station-produced holiday films, one imagines that the substantial ""inventory"" will number several hundred in the near future - to appear anew every December (or sooner).This one has a solid position among them.",Scrooged

Bill Murray is fine, but he only portrays his terribly shallow, badly written, implausible, boring semblance of a role.There's no sentiment or strength in the narrative that makes you care about the characters, what's going on... and as I've read in a review, ""the overriding emotion seems to be anger"", the whole love/redemption thing is as forced as it could be in the end.The fairy ghost is pretty fun, and the NY cab driver's okay...2.5/10.

88,statuskuo,This Is What Happens When The Writer And Lead Actor Are Friends,3,21 February 2021,"I have always defended Richard Donner, so I'm going to let him get a pass on this one, since we know it's a movie he rarely brings up, doesn't feel like a Donner flick and most likely wouldn't answer to it anyway. Suppose the real answer is...they set out to make a annual traditional film. Which they did. Sort of. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I cared about. And I think most people mistake the nostalgia of it for the reality. Which is...it stinks.I've watched this at a kiddee matinee at The New Beverly Theater when parents brought their children. It was met with very strange silence. And as the end sing-a-long occurs there was a bizarre mood. No one knew if this was a comedy, a drama or a feel good Christmas flick. The answer is: It's the Bill Murray Hour! And nothing else mattered.In this case a painful hour and forty something minutes.Written by Murray friend Mitch Glazer, this was a vehicle to make Murray more...commercial. Instead, he digs himself into a deep pit of tap dancing that becomes WAY too much. Hint: Murray, you're not THAT kind of funny. Understate Murray is better than this flailing nut. Which, of course, Murray blames Donner. And if Donner would speak of it, sure he would blame Murray.
So here we are, a drudgery of a redemption story played by someone so depleted of humanity that the end seemed so shallow tacked on feel good soliloquy vomited by someone we know doesn't feel an inch of what he is saying. Because the structure of the flick has it that he turns spots because HIS own fate was the reason.
While the original Dickens does paint him to be this selfish, there was always a moment in ALL the re-telling of Dickens that he at the very least felt a twinge of regret for the pain he's inflicted in others. In this instance, it's thwarted by Murray's inability to not be a ""man."" Sorry, it feels more like a guy any person today would pummel in the alley.
See, the real problem is...it is a dated product. References to Richard Pryor's freebasing mishap, Solid Gold dancers, Mary Lou Retton and Lee Majors plays great with Gen Xers like me. Because we were around the age this was meant for. That history is lost to the ages. As is this odd ""Free Africa"" bur Donner can't shake during this era (by the way, Dick, how did that work out? The ones in charge now imploded South African economy. Have you ever apologized for being on the wrong side of history?).
This was a forced un-fun dreadful drag through a tale that should've been heartfelt.
The ""jokes"" land with a thud (Murray isn't funny, he's...a dramatic actor trapped in the perception that he is a comedian).
There was something here that I can't put my finger on. Like...the people who slapped it together seemed to think so little of Christmas or New Yorkers.

90,jhaggardjr,Crazy Christmas Comedy,8,24 December 2000,"What an appropriate time to review this movie (Christmas Eve 2000). ""Scrooged"" isn't one of the best Christmas movies ever made, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. This is in fact a pretty funny picture, a screwball comic fantasy somewhat based on Charles Dickens' classic tale ""Scrooge"". This version is updated to modern times and is played mostly for laughs. Bill Murray gets a chance to go way over-the-top in his portrayl of Frank Cross, the IBC-TV executive who doesn't care about anyone. This guy literally is Scrooge. He makes the lives of everyone around him miserable. Then one night close to Christmas he gets a visit from his late former boss Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) who warns him that he'll be visited by three ghosts. The three ghosts will try to get Frank to change his personality by showing him the past, present, and future. ""Scrooged"" features an all-star cast of terrific actors. Besides Murray and Forsythe, there's Karen Allen as Claire Phillips, Frank's girlfriend from the past who pays him a visit; Bobcat Goldthwait as Eliot Loudermilk, an IBC employee Frank fires right before Christmas after making a criticism about a ""Scrooge"" ad Frank plans to air on the network that has absolutely nothing to do with Scrooge and is guaranteed to scare the heck out of anyone who sees it; Alfre Woodard as Grace Cooley, Frank's secretary who has a son that's mute; Robert Michum as Preston Rhinelander, the chief executive officer of IBC; David Johansen as the Ghost of Christmas Past disguised as a smelly cab driver; and (in the film's best performance) Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christmas Present passing herself off as a sugar plum fairy. There are also many cameo appearences, which include John Houseman, Jamie Farr, Lee Majors, Robert Goulet, and Olympic Gold Medal winning gymnast Mary Lou Retton (as Tiny Tim). ""Scrooged"" isn't quite the classic Christmas movie like ""A Christmas Story"". It isn't as funny as ""Story"" or ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"".

91,mcfly-31,Dickens of a comedy....,7,15 December 2006,"Pleasant enough Murray holiday diversion, with him getting the Dickens' treatment as an unfeeling television boss subjected to visits from life-altering ghosts. Though completely unpleasant until the last five minutes, Murray's character delivers enough one-liner zings to keep you loving to hate him. His manic reactions to the people around him and uncontrollable sarcasm make it a good ride. Upon hearing of the death of an elderly woman who became so scared by his ""Scrooge"" TV promo, he barks only what a self-serving executive would: ""You can't buy publicity like that! Run it every hour with a disclaimer!"" Gets a bit heavy-handed at times, as I think someone like this in real life wouldn't be effected by their past, imminent death, etc. But since we know the story we go along with it. The finale has Murray a bit of rambling shambles of a life-preacher, but not enough to sink the warmth of what he now feels. Great closing credits song by Annie Lennox and Al Green as well. HUGE cast comes off strong, namely Goldthwait in a rare restrained appearance (he still squeals, but does so in glasses and a suit), plus Johanssen and Cane as irritatingly funny ghosts; ""The bitch hit me with a toaster.""

92,acedj,"Great, modern take",8,21 November 2019,"This is a modern take on the classic Christmas story about Ebeneezer Scrooge from the story A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. To say that there was a lot of creative license taken here would be an understatement, but that does not detract from the fact that this is a great social comment on how commercialized Christmas has become. Bill Murray plays Frank Cross, a television network head that is trying to put on a live version of A Christmas Carol. He is driving his people like slaves and even tells someone to staple antlers to a mouse because they would not stay. He fires a member of his team on Christmas Eve for disagreeing with something he said. He has led a life of greed and cut off anyone that stood in his way, including his brother. That night he is payed a visit from fours ghosts, the first being his mentor, followed by the ghost of Christmas past, present and future. I am sure you are all familiar with the telling of this story. David Johnson and Carol Kane as the ghost of past and present respectively, steal the show.

93,DavidSim240183,Should have been funny. But somehow it isn't,4,2 May 2007,"After Bill Murray struck gold with Ghostbusters in 1984, he dropped off the radar a little. His personal project The Razor's Edge flopped with audiences and critics, and I think that must have been a blow to him. Besides making a cameo in the amusing Little Shop of Horrors, he stayed away from the Hollywood circuit for four years.But then in 1988 he resurfaced with Scrooged, an update on the classic Charles Dickens tale. Obviously trying to repeat the success of Ghostbusters, Scrooged was a modest hit with audiences, who considered it Murray's comeback role.When I was younger, I loved Scrooged. I thought it was funny and delivered on so many levels. But as I've gotten older, Scrooged has gone down considerably in my estimation. Instead of feeling funny, it now feels laboured, and forced. And I never thought I would say this, but the main reason Scrooged doesn't work is because of Bill Murray.Bill Murray is one of my favourite comedians. In fact I think he's one of the funniest men alive. His dry, laconic outlook on life is nearly always hilarious. Just look at some of the gems he's turned out. Ghostbusters. Groundhog Day. Lost in Translation and the sadly overlooked Broken Flowers.But then there's Scrooged. A film that should have been a perfect vehicle for Murray's talents, but it never even gets out of the gate. And I blame that on Murray, sadly. He did the theme of a miser seeing the error of his ways to much greater effect in the absolutely wonderful Groundhog Day, which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s.In Scrooged, Murray is the borderline power-mad TV exec Frank Cross. A man so consumed by greed and hate he thinks nothing of firing employees if they even look at him the wrong way. Frank is on a dangerous path, and will lose everything if he doesn't change his ways. And so step in the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to show Frank what he's missed out on in life.There is some invention during the scenes of ghostly visitations. The Ghost of Christmas Past is a grizzled New York cab driver. The meter is actually a calender that shows the year Murray is in. The Ghost of Christmas Present (a horribly screechy performance by Carol Kane) is like an insane Sugar Plum Fairy with a nasty habit of punching Frank repeatedly. The Ghost of Christmas Future is just as Dickens left it. Except it has a TV for a face.Usually I like Christmas tales with dark centres, like the excellent Nightmare Before Christmas and the hilarious Gremlins. Two brilliant films that succeed on every level. But sadly, Scrooged doesn't deliver. Whenever Bill Murray is in a film, he's usually the best thing about it. Here he's the worst. He's clearly not having a good time. He approaches each scene with indifference. When he's hands on with material, he can deliver superb performances. But he's strictly hands off with this film. And as a result, it makes his supposed redemption in the final scenes that all the more false.There are occasions where his trademark sarcasm shines. I liked the scene where he collects an award for Humanitarian of the Year. Its funny because Murray is notorious for shunning the award ceremonies, and his clear distaste for the Oscars is mirrored in that scene. His acceptance speech is a marvellous send-up of the countless celebrities who stand up to the mike and drone on and on about their achievements.But elsewhere Scrooged falls flat. There is no evidence that Frank is slowly thawing. And because Murray overacts badly in this film (strange considering that he prefers minimalist acting), I couldn't believe for a second what I was seeing. Murray spends a lot of his time shouting his way through the film to the point that it becomes tedious.In the supporting cast, we do get some occasional rays of sunshine. John Glover is hilarious as the exec brought in to lighten the burden on Frank's shoulders, when really he's after his job. John Forsythe sports an astonishing makeup job as Frank's old boss, who appears as a decaying corpse, the film's version of Marley's Ghost. And the underrated Karen Allen shines as the woman Frank gave up for the sake of his career.But its in the final scenes where Scrooged comes crashing down. Frank has seen the error of his ways. And to prove it, he barges on to the set of a live retelling of A Christmas Carol the TV studio is putting on. Frank goes on and on (and on) about the true meaning of Christmas. And its a horrible thing to see. Murray doesn't sound like he believes a word of what he's saying. It seems to go on forever. And I felt really embarrassed for him.What a pity! Scrooged could have been a hip, witty deconstruction of A Christmas Carol. And nobody does nasty and sarcastic better than Bill Murray. Where did it all go wrong then?

94,p-jonsson,A few laughs but otherwise a rather mediocre movie,5,8 December 2013,"Even though this is an attempt to turn Charles Dickens' classical story, ""A Christmas Carol"", into a modern version it is now a fairly old movie being made 1988. Yesterday was 2nd of Advent and I was in the mood for something ""Christmasy"" so when I saw that this movie was given on Paramount Channel I (actually we the family) decided to sit down and watch it.Unfortunately this attempt to modernize Dickens' old classic is met with, at best, a moderate success. Bill Murray is doing a good effort with the role he has been given. Actually, he being in the movie was one of the reasons that I decided to have a go at watching it. However the movie never really moves beyond being yet another rather mediocre comedy.His old ""friend"" visiting him as a dead guy and the first ghost was both quite cool and up to that point the movie was quite okay. However when the second ghost comes in the form of some wacky, sadistic fairy then it started to go downhill. She was not really funny and Frank's going more and more loony was not very funny either. The third ghost was rather meh.Sure there are a few laughs sprinkled around but not enough to elevate the movie to the heights that I was hoping from a movie with Bill Murray and based on Dickens' story. Most importantly, I never really got that nice and cozy Christmas tale feeling when watching the movie. The ending with the lunatic and disjointed speech by Frank was quite a letdown as far as I am concerned.The movie was good enough that the evening did not feel like a real waste but that is about it.",Scrooged

It's really forced, which takes away from the funniest recurring jokes of the tacky live Christmas Eve special in progress. That aside, this is fun and still better than the original A Christmas Carol, but the bar there is pretty low. Karen Allen is pretty and affable, but this plays pretty corny across the board with only Murrays' sales pitch pulling us through.

Murray plays a tv exec who is filming a version of the holiday classic only to see the classic tale and its ghosts visit him. A big budget can't help the flaws that include an overall unpleasant feeling for the Murray character (i know the Scrooge is not supposed to win anyone over but the viewer just doesnt care for the guy at all) and a general lack of funny situations.

Bill Murray gives a great performance from his cold and arrogant personality he transforms to a loving individual, and Murray was great all the way. Bill Murray always performs well he proved that he can be funny and serious all at the same time. Karen Allen was great as a loving female friend from the past she always knew Bill could be caring. Richard Donner adapted this perfect from the Dickens novel only to have spiced it up with a modern twist.

I acknowledge that it is a mess, it is all over the place but Bill Murray pulls of this modern retelling of the Scrooge story almost all on his own. I remember how this film was ravaged by critics and there were stories of how hectic the production was but it has aged very well. I don't even celebrate Christmas and i.love this film.

The setup is great, with Bill Murray running a TV station and putting the ratings above everything else, including his family and employees. It's a scenario that lends itself well to some comedic bits that made me laugh quite a bit, like an ultra-violent Christmas special ""The Night the Reindeer Died"" and some ridiculous programming aimed at pets. The film goes for a playful, cartoony adaptation of the story and I thought it worked well most of the time. The special effects are terrific and the over-the-top characters are fun (with the exception of the Ghost of Christmas present, which is terribly unfunny and irritating).

Even Bill Murray is can't lift this up.It all starts out well and gives the impression that this is going to be a clever, quirky comedy. It seems though, that the person who wrote the first 15 minutes of this was sacked or suffered a stroke or something, because the rest of the movie does not live up to the beginning. It drops the quirkiness and just goes for main stream, predictable laughs and maudlin sentiment at the end. The movie suffers as a result. Sadly, the wound is terminal. It's nice to see some familiar faces in minor roles - Robert Mitchum, Buddy Hackett and John Forsythe, to name a few. There are a few familiar faces it would have been nicer NOT to have seen. Bobcat Goldthwaite is chief among them. Honestly, do people really find him funny?? Really??

106,RhapsodyReviews,Outdated.,5,2 December 2019,"Review:
'Scrooged' is a Christmas-comedy film directed by Richard Donner. It is based on the novella 'A Christmas Carol' by Charles Dickens.
Unfortunately, I feel like this movie isn't going to be a hit if people are just watching it for the first time in the 21st Century. I wanted to really like this movie, but it didn't hit with me like I think it would have if I seen it in the 80's when it first came out.
It is a modern retelling that follows Frank Cross (Bill Murry), a cynical and selfish television executive, who is visited by a succession of ghosts on Christmas Eve intent on helping him regain his Christmas spirit.
I love Bill Murry, and I think he is usually the best part of any movie he is in. However, I really wasn't sold on him being the evil boss who hates Christmas and is a jerk to his employees. I don't think it was the right fit. My favorite part of this movie was Carole Kane who plays the Ghost of Christmas Present. She is a feisty angel and was easily the most likable and funniest character in the movie.
The story was entertaining, and it was a nice modern retelling of an old story. I liked how Bill Murry was acting as Scrooge while shooting a TV Special called Scrooge. Where I don't enjoy the film was the editing. Especially closer to the end of the film it feels very choppy and wraps up quick.
Overall, I'm not going to say it was a bad movie by any means. I just see things that could have been better based on my opinion. I didn't think the role was meant for Bill Murry and the editing was choppy. If you find yourself wanting to watch this around the Holiday's you can still have a good time with it, but I don't think it will be one I revisit every year.

107,Benjamin_Cox,"Like Chrismas presents, it's nice but not exactly what you wanted - 66%",6,30 December 2009,"Despite the vast amount of Christmas movies out there, most of them seem to revolve around the classic redemption of a curmudgeonly lead character. Since ""It's A Wonderful Life"", how many festive flicks have you seen based around this premise. Personally, I blame Charles Dickens but even he won't have predicted this modern update on his novel ""A Christmas Carol"". But is it any good, even with Hollywood's best curmudgeon as the lead? As Christmas Eve comes round again, professional Grinch and TV exec Frank Cross (Bill Murray) plans a live TV extravaganza adapting ""A Christmas Carol"", focusing on scaring everybody in the name of ratings. Trouble is, Frank isn't really a Christmas person as he fires young Eliot Loudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait) and harasses his overworked secretary (Alfre Woodard). His miserly ways even keep his ex, charity worker Claire (Karen Allen), at arms length. But Frank is soon visited by three ghosts, all of whom are determined to show Frank the error of his ways and reignite the true meaning of Christmas.""Scrooged"" might not be as off-message as ""Bad Santa"" but as Murray shouts, rants and flies off the handle in spectacular fashion, it's hard not to be swept up in the film's message - no matter how many times you've heard it before. We all know Murray can carry a film by himself as anyone who has seen ""Groundhog Day"" will testify so it's a little surprising to find others raising their game as well. Allen is good as the sweet-as-cherry-pie love interest as is Carol Kane as the Ghost Of Christmas Present and David Johansen as the Ghost Of Christmas Past. But what impressed me the most is the thought and detail which has gone into this film. The Ghost Of Christmas Future is a genuinely unsettling presence and some of the effects are actually very good, despite the age of the film.So why aren't I head over heels in love with this film? Well, it's entirely predictable and in my opinion, too sentimental at the end. And like Jim Carrey, how much you'll enjoy the movie depends on how long you can handle Murray's breakneck performance because as much as I like Murray, he did begin to grate towards the end and he dominates the picture like a seasoned comic professional. Maybe I'm nit-picking because I did enjoy ""Scrooged"" but personally, I feel that there are better Christmas films out there and better Bill Murray films out there. It seems a shame to say it because this is funny, feel-good festive fun. I guess what I wanted was another ""Groundhog Day"" which is a classic Bill Murray film that also revolves around the redemption of a grumpy sourpuss but is much funnier and more inventive.",Scrooged

The supporting cast makes for a memorable and funny cast of characters, especially the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future.

110,Chromium_5,"""I must've been out of my miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind!""",8,29 November 2005,"Oh man, I love this movie. It is unlike any other Christmas movie you'll ever see. This is warped, surreal, and insane. Richard Donner surpasses Tim Burton in terms of darkness, and the only problem is that the producers rewrote the script to make it LESS dark. A shame, because they were really onto something. The ghosts are grotesque, the sets are distorted and weird, and even the ending is dark. At first it seems out of synch with the rest of the movie with over the top sentimentality, until you realize it is disturbingly over the top, and Murray is playing the character as if he's been driven insane. The movie as a whole is a lot more chilling if you look at that way.Bill Murray's dry style of humor doesn't work for everyone, but it works for me. He can deliver lines like no one else, and even his facial expressions are genius. When a nerdy, stuttering employee (Bobcat Goldthwaith) tells him, ""Gee, Mr. Cross, I think you and I are alike in a lot of ways,"" Murray reacts with the funniest expression in the history of the universe. (It's even funnier than the face he makes at the old lady in the cab in ""Stripes,"" and THAT was funny). Frank Cross, like most of Murray's characters, is sarcastic and mean, but with a sense of humor that lets you know there's a good person in there trying to get out. It's the same with the movie: there is a heart underneath the morbid tone, and it occasionally surfaces with really touching scenes.I'm not saying it's a perfect movie. The script has weak spots, but the look and style make up for it. It's certainly not for everyone. I can see how some people would find this abrasive. But if you like Bill Murray and dark humor, this one's for you.",Scrooged

He was the comedic driving force behind this movie. If I was laughing, it was because of something Bill Murray said.

What we have here was a modern (in the 1980's) telling of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' with Bill Murray playing Frank Cross the modern version of Ebenezer Scrooge. Here Frank Cross is a TV executive who now when you look back on it probably comes across even worse than he was played at thee time being the complete reflection of those money grabbing times. He is crass uncaring and completely self obsessed. Of course we then get the modern telling of a Christmas carol well Cross is visited by the ghosts of Christmas past present and future with some very amusing pay offs. A lot of the jokes obviously went straight over my head as a teenager I found very funny now and Murray is on superb form here matching his Ghost Busters performance. Even though this has the corny ending you know it has to have you can not help but enjoy the ending which is added by a track from the sublime Al Green.

I'm not a Bobcat Goldthwait fan by any sense of the word, but I found him relatively likable here, in contrast to those other two.

It's a rare feat for a film to pull off a story that you essentially know in advance how it will turn out, yet still keep you engaged, and ""Scrooged"" pulls it off.

126,DrPhibes1964,One of the most mean spirited Christmas films I have ever seen,2,24 November 2020,"There is one single scene in the film I found to be genuinely moving and that is when Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is transported via taxi cab driven by Jake Johansson to when he was a boy. Watching him with his mother at that age is the only heartfelt moment in this otherwise ugly and very mean spirited Christmas movie. I've seen various adaptations of A Christmas Carole and even at his worst Scrooge is never as cruel.and sadistic as Frank Cross. Perhaps it is due in part of my dislike of Bill Murray who seems to have found a niche place with these sort man-child characters who need to go on some sort of quest to redeem himself. But in most of those previous adaptations of the Dickens story the redemption was earned and we get the impression that Scrooge was made bitter by various events in his life. I have never felt that way about Frank Cross. He comes across as a spoiled and entitled SOB who feels more like a sitcom caricature that an actual character. As much as I like Carol Kane her scene with Murray has to be the most unpleasant to watch as she smashes him with a toaster, pokes him in the eye, and just beats him up. It should be slightly enjoyable to watch but it isn't by any stretch of the imagination. But even the supporting characters are straight of a sitcom and the ending is nothing but schmaltz. It could have been a good retelling of the story but it is as subtle as a ballpean hammer to the chestnuts. If it wanted to go dark then stay dark and not go for the warm fuzzy ending. But as mentioned above, that scene with his mom, especially when she calls him Frankie Angel. Niagara Falls.",Scrooged
127,Lamia7609,Excellent Movie,10,20 November 2001,"I love this movie and watch it every x-mas. Bill Murray had his finest performance in this movie, until he made Ground Hog day. It's based off of the Dicken's work ""A X-mas Carol"". I think this is the reason that people have been more critical than I think is needed. This is one of those few movies that is both hilarious and moving at the same time. Bill Murray does a great job of going from a complete ass to someone who has seen the light. It's a journey I enjoy going on every x-mas. I'm looking forward to the trip this year.",Scrooged

130,RJV,Bah Humbug!,2,23 September 2002,"(Possible spoilers) SCROOGED is the cinematic equivalent of coal in your stocking, a disheartening experience that sours your feelings about the Yuletide season. If this film conveys the true meaning of Christmas, I don't want to observe this holiday.The concept is promising- Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" updated for the 1980s with Scrooge as a callous, ratings-mad television executive. And the film gets off to a great start with hilarious promos for ""The Night the Reindeer Died"" about Santa battling terrorists and ""Robert Goulet's Old-Fashioned Cajun Christmas."" But from there, the movie generally goes downhill.Part of the problem, as a previous reviewer has noted, is that SCROOGED doesn't know whether to honor or skewer Dickens's story.  By constantly fluctuating between iconoclastic humor and earnest sweetness, the movie not only reveals the filmmakers' lack of focus, but their cynical desire to pander to both sentimentalists and scoffers. This only results in a meandering muddle.What ultimately ruins SCROOGED is Bill Murray's surprisingly bad performance in the lead.  Most of the time when he's mean, he's humorless and unpleasant.  Murray doesn't even convey an interesting ruthlessness that made Alastair Sim's pre-reformation Scrooge so compelling. He's just an unbearable boor.  And in his tender moments, Murray's too detached to be moving.He is at his worst in the final scene where he proclaims his love for Christmas on live television.  There's no joy in his speech, just desperation.  It's enough to make one empathize with the pre-reformation Scrooge.If you rever Dickens' original story, watch a straightforward adaption, especially the 1951 Alastair Sim version. If you're in the mood for holiday satire, watch BLACKADDER'S CHRISTMAS CAROL. Whatever your mood, I doubt you'll find SCROOGED satisfying.",Scrooged
131,benm-41751,Murray just did not convince me,2,18 December 2018,"I couldn't get more than a quarter way into this movie. Murray did not convince me as what his character was supposed to be.

It's hard to describe, but something about the movie is very messy. It zooms around without ever anchoring you into any scene or to any character.",Scrooged
132,strat-8,This movie is watchable over and over again.,10,7 July 1999,"Part of Bill Murray's genius is his ability to alternate between sardonic, deadpan delivery, and over-the-top, wave-the-arms enthusiastic speeches. You get heaping helpings of both here.  Bill Murray is the Jerry Lewis of the 90's.  This is an ideal Bill Murray vehicle.  Even though you know it's a spoof, a send-up, rip-off, parody of A Christmas Carol (hence they didn't use the actual title), it still makes you laugh and cry bittersweet tears at the end.  However, don't look for deep meaning or high-brow writing.  This is nothing but a ride through the fun house.  Know what you're getting, then hang on and let it happen.

I can't imagine any other actor of modern times, as appropriate, for the title role. Bill Murray goes beyond the bounds of funny here. His performance is the next level up. In fact, I would endeavor to say that this is his best performance in any movie he's made to date. But it isn't only he that makes this one great film, his supporting cast is spot-on perfect. I love the slapstick repartee between himself and Carol Kane (Christmas Present) and ""Bobcat"" Goldthwait's performance is impeccable. The scene in the restaurant between Bill, Bob Mitchum and John Glover had me reeling in my seat. There are simply too many hilarious moments in this film for me to mention, it could take all night.

134,Mr Pants,They didn't even get the name of the Dickens' story right!,3,28 January 1999,"This is something that has bugged me since I saw this film in the theater, oh so long ago (youthful indiscretion!). I could prattle on (as I am wont to do) about the uninspired rewrite of the Dickens' classic, the wasted talents of notables such as David Johansen and Carole Kane, and the general Hollywood pitfall of missing the whole damn point of an otherwise good story! But I won't. Well, not much anyhow.At the center of this story-within-a-story, Bill Murray's character's TV station is about to put on a star-studded version of ""A Christmas Carol."" I don't know how or why this could have happened, but they keep referring to the story as simply ""Scrooge."" Of course, this was the name of the musical remake, but the show in the film is not the musical. Yet they continue throughout the film to refer to it as ""based on Charles Dickens' immortal 'Scrooge.'"" Who was in charge of research on this film? why didn't the best boy or lead man or hairdresser speak up and say, ""Uh, guys? That's not actually the right name."" A perfect example of Hollywood spending lotsa cash and producing garbage.Okay, I can't help it: A thing that really bothered me was the final ghost visitiation. When Bill Murray watches his body being cremated and then finds himself in the coffin is a complete misrepresentation of that point of the original story. Scrooge is moved by seeing his own grave, not because he is dead, but because he realizes he will die all alone, with not one to mourn his passing. I wish I could say ""Scrooged"" was destined for the same lonesome fate, but it is so damn annoying I can't stop babbling about it.There. I feel much better now.",Scrooged

137,lippylip26,The biggest lot of rubbish I have ever seen next to several othe,2,16 November 2021,"First let's get one thing straight
I do not like Bill Murray's performances
One of the only shows that i have found him reasonable chi's in Groundhog Day
All his performances are putrid in all the shows I have seen him in
He is loud, rude, obnoxious, idiotic, a big mouth arrogant and totally unlikable
I don't know what he is like off stage but onstage chev comes through as a totally despicable person
Even in Groundhog Day he was the same but he redeemed himself at the end
Likewise with Jim Carey
There is only one movie I have enjoyed him in and that is Liar Liar
As one critic said many of the scenes were most definitely not for children
The violence in this movie although dubbed as slapstick are very much over the top both with the ghost of Christmas present and the fired employee
It was interesting to see him playing a different role compared to the one he played in POLICE Academy
He still retains his squeaky voice
The Ghost of Christmas Present is the biggest turn off of the whole movie
The Ghost of Christmas was worthy of a horror movie
Definitely not for children
The only reason why I watched the show is because I had it on DVD and the DVD also found the show reprehensible and stopped working 25% into the show so I wanted to see the whole movie
I'm sorry I did
This is one show I would take and throw in the dustbin
The ending was lousy as well yetbthst was really the only redeeming feature of the show
It wasn't the finale but the song Put a Little Love in your heart that's gets the show 2/10 rather than a one out of ten.As far as I'm concerned this show is a total mockery and an insult to the Original Christmas Carol
I have seen many other versions of a Christmas Carol and not one of them have scored less than 7/10 with me
Stay away from this show and even more important keep your kids away from it as well.",Scrooged

Bill Murray and Karen Allen are aces here. One of my favorite screen couples. Bill Murray's real life brother John played his role very satisfactorily, as of course, did Carol Kane.Though I like to watch Alastair Sim's Scrooge (7/10) this time of year, I prefer Scrooged because, to my mind, it manages to retain the heart of the story while succeeding as a comedy. There is more to it, however over the top it may be.I have mixed feelings about the characterization of Claire in the future. Though it is highly unlikely that a woman so endearing would descend to that, the scene gives more emphasis and purpose to Frank's awakening.",Scrooged

There are some changes from the book, which make the movie even better. I'm not going to spoil them here, but I know that you will be pleasantly surprised by the good things that are in the version that aren't in others. I think that you would enjoy it and would recommend this to everyone. I wish that I owned an official copy, but it doesn't matter as I can still watch it.

How do you slide into a seemingly underwritten role and crack me so consistently... up?  Who cares?  Scrooged is not his best movie (What About Bob is my personal favorite, but pick yours and if it doesn't have an elephant or Michael Jordan in it it'll be hard to argue with you).  And it's got Marion from Raiders in it to boot. The story is an update of the classic Dickens tale - Jacob Marley, three ghosts, Tiny Tim, yada yada. There are some funny takes on the scenarios and some interesting cameos to go along with nifty special effects.

142,mockfilmreviews,"A holiday classic, that's a classic all it's own.",7,24 January 2016,"Scrooged (1988), directed by Richard Donner, takes a darkly funny poke at the classic Dicken's tale of the curmudgeonly miser Scrooge from A Christmas Carol. The hilarious as usual Bill Murray takes on the titular role who is updated to a cutthroat T.V. producer named Frank Cross. A selfish prick who will stop at nothing to make a profit. Unable to see the wicked path he has started down, Frank is visited by the ghost his mentor Lew Hayward (Forsythe), a philandering, dirtbag producer who taught Frank everything he knows (or knew). Seeing the error of his terrible decisions only after his death on a golf course, Lew tries to set Frank on the right path.What follows is more than just your three ghosts of Christmas, oh no, this flick turns them specters up to eleven my friends. With the likes of David Johanson as a grimy cigar chewing New York cabby aka Ghost of Christmas Past and Carol Kane as the adorably abusive Ghost of Christmas Present, the direction the story moves towards is both familiar enough to evoke sentimentality as well as bring the viewer to a manic and darkly funny place. The new spins on the old favorites hit all of the marks and even for the time the film was released it doesn't feel dated.

This picture is funny and it gives the people a happy ending.This movie makes me laugh every time I see it. as with all Christmas Movies, it is best seen around Christmas time, of coarse. The story is based on A christmas Carol, but the main character played by Bill Murrey is the president of a television broadcast company. The story is like the Christmas Carol, loosely, but the ending has one extra elemant that makes it an even better ending than any other Christmas Carol Movie. This film is one of Bill Murrey's best, and definately takes it's place alongside ""It's a wonderful life"" and ""Christmas Vacation"" as a true Christmas Classic 8/10",Scrooged
144,Forgotten_Conscience_Productions,Scrooged Review: Would you like to be Scrooged?,9,7 June 2013,"You'll notice a certain trend to the films that I watch around the holidays. There have been a lot of Christmas movies over the years and they all have something to say about the holiday season. But when you look at the movies that I watch, you notice a very obvious trend. I tend to gravitate towards those that follow in the footsteps of the classic Dickens tale. I'm sure you know the one I am talking about, and if you don't then reading my blog will most definitely give you the inside track. And so we come to the great film Scrooged. A classic in its own right, part of a great trend of films that came from the era of the 1980s, starring the illustrious Bill Murray.Now Bill Murray is something of a gem when it comes to the films that he is in. I don't think anyone would argue with me if I said that in the era of mid-late 80s and early 90s Bill Murray could do no wrong. From Ghostbusters to What About Bob to Groundhog Day these films are hugely popular, thanks in no small part to the performance of Mr. Murray. Whether these films stand the test of time is another question entirely, but for anyone who wants to take a look back at the world they used to live in this is a great film. Scrooged on the other hand has something that his other films don't, it adapts a story which has stood the test of time already and gives it a modern twist, or at least what was modern for the day.Not since West Side Story's adaptation of Romeo and Juliet have people so embraced a modern version of a story that's been repeated by so many before it and many more afterwards. In part because it's very clear in watching it that the people involved understood the adaptation they were making and the times they were living in. They were smart enough to change key elements, like the names of the characters involved but never lost sight of the idea that the original characters they represented were key to making the story work. And the one major change they did make was played to perfection for the modern telling by the great Bobcat Goldthwait.Would you like to get Scrooged? I do, and so should you. Every year on Christmas Eve as the story itself goes, and every year I am trying to hold it together through the end as I tear up through the beautiful speech at the end.To check out more of my reviews, go here:http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",Scrooged
145,HungryforCheese,Its exactly what you wanted...,8,10 December 2020,"This is supposed to be a subversive take on a Christmas classic we all know very well. The best things a movie like that can do is surprise and entertain you, while also standing out on its own, and Scrooged does that very well. Bill is great in this, the ghost are all very entertaining, surprising, memorable, and sometimes, even disturbing to look at. The romance is actually pretty alright, and the score isn't memorable, but it MAKES certain scenes. Both the humor and emotional beats hit, and the ending is bit long I guess, but Bills acting makes it worth it, it all feels real, not like some tacked on message. Aside from the mostly grey color pallet, this movie a fantastic Christmas classic with some pretty great moments.",Scrooged
146,poeticanarquica,YES. Dear viewer. Bill Murray is God.,9,28 March 2020,"This is one of the best comedies of all times. Not only to see it in christmas.
A great adaptation, a beautiful tale about kindness, humanity and the power of love and hope over the sadness, the greed and selfish.The direction of Donner is perfect. and of course, Bill Murray like always, get the perfect measure over comedy, and shows his incredible drama skills (""remember the Catara falls, Frankie"" he´s just...marvelous)This film is an adult and respectful film, with the viewer, hide from the silly comedy and the easy jokes, that are the poor formula in this kind of films nowadays. His balance over comedy, drama, and a little bit of terror that Richard Donner gave it, make this film a little masterpiece.Of course ITS RIDICOLOUS that Mr. Bill Murray don't have an Oscar.
He's a wonderful actor, his solid charisma always been with him over the years. His filmography its very solid, and he made a remarkable work in every movie.I Love Bill films, I love this film,.

148,ericventura,100 Minutes of Scrooging,3,7 June 2017,"Scrooged, born of the unimaginative minds of untalented producers, attempts to render a classic into a modern adaptation (for originality). Clearly setting up a parallel between the classic story and the movie's story, the development is not lost on the viewer and could have been admirable, if it were not so obvious and actually contributed to the overall product. However, soon after the first minutes of the movie, the supposed ingenuity was lost and replaced with the typical, formulaic comedy movie starring a bumbling businessman, a hopeless love, and the newly recruited executive. While there are a few elicited laughs, the comedy is speckled with monologues, hopelessness, and anger, turning a Murray comedy into a drama. Maybe Donner was shooting for something like Fargo (1996), except that he forgot how to make a film, instead using the wrong movie mold straight off the shelf. The acting is typical of your typical comedy: typical, reminiscent of Happy Gilmore (1996). Everything was typical, possibly excluding the set and artistic direction aspect with the ghost costumes and TV sets. Unfortunately, the only question this film made me ask was: Why did I watch this film? Technically, the movie attacked the morality of corrupt and greedy businessmen, offering the resolution of living a humanitarian lifestyle, but it was simply adapted from a story as well-known as the Bible. The framing of the story by the writers was decent due to its parallelism to the adapted story and well-structured flashbacks, but they seemed to have forgotten their knock-knock joke book at home when they wrote the script. At least, Murray helped a bit with his classic improvisations. Should anyone watch this movie the day after they watched it the first time, it would be a completely new experience because they won't be able to remember anything of this unmemorable movie. Scrooge could remember his humanity, but Scrooged won't be remembered at all.",Scrooged
149,chrissch,One of my holiday and year-round favorites,8,28 December 2006,"Scrooged is a Bill Murray vehicle, so if you don't like Murray, you won't like Scrooged. Since I do like Murray and his style, I loved Scrooged. It's full of slapstick, sight gags, and Murray's caustic one-liners, and delightful performances by familiar character actors. All of that helps Scrooged avoid the Victorian heaviness of most orthodox productions of A Christmas Carol. And Scrooged delivers the same promise of redemption for the jaded and cynical: Frank Cross (Bill Murray)'s transformation moves me more than do most straight versions of A Christmas Carol, and I watch Scrooged year-round, not just at Christmas.Some of the reviews here unjustly say that Scrooged departs from the Dickens story. It's adapted to the modern day and to Murray's biting comic style, but otherwise Scrooged is true to the heart of A Christmas Carol. A man who was kind and loving in his youth turns cynical, greedy, and mean, and is redeemed through the intervention of the four ghosts (three of whom are played, in Scrooged, by the talented John Forsythe, David Johansen, and Carol Kane). Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, and the woman Scrooge loved in his youth have their counterparts too.Scrooged isn't exactly a family movie. It has a fair bit of profanity, and several scenes that are gruesome even though the effects are obviously and intentionally fake. And its Ghost of Christmas Future is more grisly than most. If you're planning to show Scrooged to kids under about age 10, or especially sensitive kids, preview it yourself first.A good guide to whether you'll like Scrooged is Groundhog Day. Scrooged has the main character's same egotism and cynicism (times two!), and the transformation of the character into a human being you'd actually like to know. Groundhog Day was a gentler movie. But if you liked it, and you're OK with some profanity, dead-people special effects, and the Tim-Burtonesque tone, you'll probably like Scrooged.",Scrooged

I personally find this one to be neither.Oh yes! People keep asking why this is called ""Scrooged"" instead of ""Scrooge.""One reason could be because the main character isn't actually named Scrooge but is given (or so they try to convince you) a storyline that makes them Scroogelike (or Scrooged).Then, ""Scrooged"" sounds like ""Screwed"" as in the short version of ""Screwed-up.""If it's used in this way, they are telling you the truth about this movie in the title: It's a modernized story of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,""--but, in that role, it's ""Screwed-Up."" That is, a big mistake.I guess it's a matter of taste.If you prefer watching PeeWee's Playhouse to watching Captain Kangaroo, you must might think this movie is great stuff.However, I cut my teeth on Captain Kangaroo, and, when I happened to tune into PeeWee's Playhouse one Saturday morning several years ago (the 1980s, I think), it left me cold!",Scrooged

This comedy has quite a few giggles. it doesn't really make me laugh deep down but it makes me chuckle for a little while. The sound effects are used as jokes as well. For example. When the taxi driver is driving bill murray he runs a cat over and cat screams. but you never see it happen. then near the end the man gets angry on the phone and then kicks a cat but you never see that either. When the ghost of Christmas past comes along she throws her wand away and then the sound of glass breaking occurs. you never see the glass break. later on she does the same thing and it hits glass but nothing is seen. This movie made me cry in the end and in the middle. very dramatic elements. Now referring to the title. During the end scene, bill murray asks how his hostages are doing with his crazy friend. so the crazy friend decides to make the hostages party and there is a fat woman who is sitting at the desk and is trying to do the chicken dance but is crying while she partys. It makes me feel so happy watching that fat woman struggle and suffer while crying in fright. it is almost pleasurable because she is fat and is flapping around suffering suffering suffering!!! I suggest you watch it to see that part of the woman suffering and crying. it is probably the best part in the entire movie.",Scrooged

""Scrooged"" is a cinematic gem, one of the most outstanding films of the '80s or any time for that matter. Bill Murray is at his comedic best, and he is entirely convincing as a bitter network exec who has lost sight of the important things in his life, like family and friends. You know the Dickens story, but Richard Donner's film version breathes life into the story and gives it extra meaning for modern audiences. Supporting actors all do wonders with their roles, from Robert Mitchum to Carol Kane to Michael J. Pollard. This film will make you laugh, and will certainly bring a little warmth into your Christmas season.For those who sight this film as mean-spirited or dark, they surely must be missing something. This film is funny, charming, and sweet. Frightening and warm at the same time, ""Scrooged"" is a modern masterpiece that has been unjustly overlooked and unappreciated. While there are other enjoyable Christmas films of the '80s (""A Christmas Story"" and ""Christmas Vacation"" seem to get more than enough praise), none can hold a light towards ""Scrooged"", an excellent Christmas movie for modern audiences.",Scrooged
154,madahab,Unpleasant and mean spirited,2,9 November 2021,"Of all the versions of A Christmas Carol I have seen this is by far the most mean spirited one. I am not a great admirer of Bill Murray as he seems to play a variation of the same character in film after film, namely the man-child who must go through some quest to find redemption and to win over the central love interest of the story. Once in a while the formula works despite Murray always coming across as an annoying presence no matter what he does. In Scrooged he is at his most obnoxious. There is one sequence that I find genuinely moving and involves him being taken back in time to see himself as a young boy and his very sweet relationship with his mother. ""Merry Christmas, Frankie angel, "" says his mother. The adult Frank Cross tears up....and so do I. It is a scene that earns its emotions naturally, unlike the conclusion where you are beaten over the head in a desperate attempt to solicit emotions. The sequence where Frank is being beat up by one of the ghosts (played by Carol Kane) is among the most unpleasant. I'm willing to bet that a few of those punches landed, whether intentionally or accidentally is a matter of speculation. Karen Allen is the only genuinely likeable character in the film and it seems to be the most implausible aspect of the story that such a kind-hearted person would be interested in such a deeply cynical person as Frank Cross. I'll believe in Jacob Marley before that relationship. I've watched this once or twice and that's enough. There are far better Christmas films.",Scrooged

157,DietCoke13,Scrooged,10,24 December 2010,"This is a great rendition of Dickens's story. I enjoy reading Roger Ebert's reviews of movies, and usually agree with him. However, I completely disagree with him on this one. I think this film captures the very essence of the original story. He thinks Frank Cross is too mean. Isn't that exactly the point? It is also absolutely hilarious. The casting is excellent. Carol Kane is a stand out as the Ghost of Christmas Present. Frank Cross's transformation is excellent. I love how Bill Murray allows himself to get emotional. And, little Calvin's ""miracle"" is so poignant, it brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.",Scrooged
158,qubit01,Another old Christmas classic,8,23 May 2013,"One of the movies in my Christmas Collection, and one of my favorites. An all star cast and a unique spin on a Dickens classic. Bill Murray is hilarious, as is Carol Kane- they are my favorites in this movie. Murray plays an absolute ass who loves nothing but money and success, until he gets his whole world turned upside down starting with a visit from his old boss. Nothing much else to say, it's ""A Christmas Carol"" with a great cast and nonstop laughs, plus some very dramatic moments that might make you jerk a tear. It's a funny film with a good moral message, and though it has it's adult moments it's fine for kids- I was twelve when it came out and loved it, and have seen it hundreds of times. I agree with a previous reviewer who said they should play this nonstop every Christmas!",Scrooged
159,christabeladebayo,When comedy was comedy :-D,10,25 July 2021,"Such a feel great, hilarious movie. Bill Murray is just an incredible comedian. From his subtle facial expressions to his crazy outbursts; this film is brilliant thanks to him. They don't make films like this no more.",Scrooged
160,jeremyglick,In defense of Scrooged,7,14 January 2010,"""Scrooged"" is a little comedic gem that I rank somewhere between ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Elf"" among yuletide movies, and between ""Stripes"" and ""What About Bob?"" in the Bill Murray oeuvre. It has suffered commercially because the dark palettes and tones used by the director have precluded people from adding it to their holiday traditions (who sits around a tree and says ""let's watch 'Scrooged'!""?), and also because this role was a departure of sorts for Murray. It was his ""Cable Guy"". The reaction was summed up by Roger Ebert's one-star review where the main problem seemed to be the ""disquieting, unsettling"" tone and Murray's character, Cross, being a ""thoroughly miserable wretch"". It's an understandable take and one that was probably widely shared, mostly because by now we all carry an impression of Ebenezer Scrooge as a crusty old miser with a heart of gold just waiting to burst through. The term ""scrooge"" itself has entered the lexicon as a mild reprimand, a synonym for ""party-pooper"". Heck, it's almost lovable! What I think we all overlook, however, is how dark, unsettling, and miserable the source material from Dickens actually was. The Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" was a man who fed himself gruel and wouldn't heat his own home, all just to save money. According to Dickens, ""External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty."" Ebenezer had long since given up on love, family, or simple pleasures, and further was a ""squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scarping, clutching, covetous old sinner"" who ""carried his own low temperature always about with him"". To him, brotherhood of man was an alien concept, and other people were (at best) commodities or (at worst) things to be loathed. To quote Scrooge, ""Every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart"", and he didn't say it to get a laugh. Ignoring the darkest aspects of Scrooge's character is a disservice to the story.So not only was it fair, it was necessary to make the Cross character the wretch he was. And for my money, Murray did a great job of giving us glimpses of Cross's humanity at even his darkest moments. And how dark was he really? Show me a corporate executive who hasn't fired someone near the holidays to save payroll. Show me a media mogul who hasn't attempted to profit off of people's fears and insecurities. And show me a TV producer who hasn't stapled toy antlers to a mouse.Okay, so that last one doesn't stick, but that moment in the movie still proves my point. However serious Cross may be about being an ass, Murray delivers it in such a way that allows us to laugh.Probably what I appreciate most about the film is the adaptation. Say what you will about the folly of modernizing and American-izing classic tales – if 'A Christmas Carol' had to be set in 1980s America, this was the way to do it. There are several moments in the film that are RIGHT, like when the first ghost (Forsythe) appears. Like any scared, ruthless, modern executive, Cross reacts by emptying his revolver at the intruder. The film then shows Cross wise-cracking his way through the visitations mainly because it's entertaining, but also because that would be the defense mechanism of a cynical, world-weary man. These moments fit. Nowadays, studios call it a remake if they take a 20-year-old screenplay and cast different actors. ""Scrooged"" at least gets credit for being a true reinvention.Sure, there are flaws. Karen Allen's character is weak and Cross's speech at the end is cloying and drawn out. And maybe too much slapstick with the ghosts. But I still consider this an underrated gem.",Scrooged
161,wayofthecass,Seasonal Murray vehicle has its moments.,6,27 October 2007,"The reviews by the critics for this film were terrible. However the general viewer feedback is good. The film has some sappy, overblown moments ie.- the ending. But its all done in good spirits. If your a Bill Murray fan you'll love it. As the morally redundant TV exec Frank Cross, Murray gets far and away the most screen time and his straight faced, dry humour is just perfect for this type of character.The film is a modern update of 'A Christmas Carol' for anyone who doesn't already know with the aforementioned Murray character Frank Cross replacing the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. After being initially visited by his now deceased ex-boss(represented rather shockingly as an old decaying, mouse infested corpse still wearing the golf uniform he suffered his life ending heart attack in on the fairway) and on whom he had based his own career (though Frank has gone on to become even more selfish and concerned with the bottom line than even he was) Cross simply dismisses the episode as the result of high level executive pressure. In particular Frank is stressing out about his network's live Christmas eve broadcast which is surprise, surprise a big budget live version of 'A Christmas Carol'. However he is in turn visited by 3 very different versions of the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to the one's represented in the Dicken's tale , with the possible exception of the final ghost who is much more traditional in representation than the others. The role of Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchet are represented by Cross's long suffering secretary and her young son who is a mute as a result of the trauma of seeing his father murdered several years before. There is a couple of interesting side stories involving Murray rekindling the only real relationship he has ever had with his first love Clare who he decides to recontact amongst all of the madness as well as a confident young new executive who has been brought on board and tries to act as Frank's friend but is clearly planning to usurp him. This attempt is aided by everyone's perception that Frank appears to be suffering some kind of breakdown as he tries to deal with the bizarre impingement on his life by the aforementioned ghosts. Possibly the most entertaining of the story lines not relating directly to the main one involves a naive young board member played by the usually larger than life, but here toned down, Bobcat Goldthwaite who has been fired as a result of innocently questioning a violent promo for the live show which Cross has commissioned. As Frank is dealing with his ghost's Bobcat's character descends into a rather pathetic depression and desperate alcoholism , in the space of a few days, as he tries to come to terms with his unemployment.I really enjoyed John Glover as the slimy Californian exec who is obviously after Cross's job. It kind of underlines the point that though Cross is nasty at least what you see is what you get. Glover's character is completely 2-faced. The character obviously made an impact on the makers of Gremlins 2 because they cast Glover in an almost identical role in that movie a mere two years later.Karen Allen as Carol is convincingly sweet and warm as possibly the only person who can truly help redeem Frank but both her and Robert Mitchum as Frank's boss are somewhat underused and in the case of a legendary talent like Mitchum's you almost wonder why he is in it.Anyway in summation if you like Murray you'll love this. If you don't your enjoyment may suffer but there are still laughs to be had at the send ups of Christmas Network programming ie-. 'Bob Goulet's Cajun Christmas' , 'The Night the Reindeer Died' with Lee Majors and 'Dad Loves Chasing Beaver.' The soundtrack, special effects and make-up are also first rate. However be warned, it is very dark and at times a little sad, particularly in one scene in which Frank re-encounters one of the homeless people he had met earlier at Claire's shelter in a disused boiler room on a typically freezing New York winters night. So if your looking for an uplifting, fun seasonal movie instead of just a good laugh then avoid this. At least up until the end anyway where they all live happily ever after. I would also not be to keen on showing it to very young kids. Its not exactly a horror film but there are enough moments to scare some children and the humour is for the best part more on the adult side.",Scrooged
162,toronto_ghostbuster,A very enjoyable film,8,25 December 2009,"This movie is fantastic. Although the supporting cast is great, every single other actor is completely out shined by Murrays brilliance. To me it's kind of a shame that he's been recognized mostly for his work with Wes Anderson. Although he brings a certain flavour to all of the Wes films you never quite find yourself begging for more Bill as you would after this picture, or What about bob. This movie made me think about all of the roles Murray either should have been cast as, or roles he should have taken. I couldn't help but think that he may have made a better American Psycho than Christian Bale, and I'm a huge Bale/Bateman fan. Bottom line, the humour is anything but cheesy, and you may find yourself laughing at your TV with no one around because Bill is genuinely funny in this role.Approved!",Scrooged

I've seen this a dozen times now (starting with a theater showing during which you could just feel the energy growing) and it hasn't lost it's luster at all.

The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was a couple of casting choices - I like Bobcat but would he be a budding network exec?For those that haven't seen it, don't read anymore reviews and watch it.

The 3 stars I'm giving it is a generous rating, and it pains me to say that, since I generally enjoy Bill Murray quite a bit.
However, as most of the other negative reviews here note, he is dreadful in this retelling of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". Others have pointed out that he seems uninvolved in the movie but I'm going more with those who feel his performance suggests he's more contemptuous of it than anything else. Shouting, scowling and declaiming his lines in a perfunctory devoid of any true emotionalism, he's exhausting and tiresome to watch. His ""redemption"" at the grand finale is utterly unconvincing and a drawn out mess that feels tacked on and perfunctory.Only David Johansen and Carol Kane bring any life to the film while Robert Mitchum, John Forsythe and Karen Allen are largely wasted in their thankless and underdeveloped roles.

170,Phoneutria-03,GCSE question: How is scrooge presented as unlikeable in 'a Christmas carol'?,10,3 September 2021,"Scrooge is presented as unlikable, by Dickens showing that he is selfish and entitled in the novella when the author submits the quote "" secret self- contained, and solitary as an oyster"". The use of a simile in this quotation makes the reader think about Scrooge's repelling personality. This demonstrates that Dicken's wants the reader to believe that Scrooge is a bad person. The effect of the word ""oyster"" suggests that he keeps to himself and is represented as egocentric as an oyster metaphorically does, when the author directly uses the simile to compare Scrooge to. This is significant a typically in the Victorian Era wealthy business men such as scrooge were portrayed as being more selfish than the other classes.",Scrooged
171,cjorgensen-3,"A bit slow-paced, but super-happy ending.",9,1 December 2011,"I saw this on TV one night. It's a children's movie from the '80's, so they pace is a bit slow. (There is some mild language in it though, so I wouldn't let the VERY young kids see it.) The plot is sort of ""Network meets A Christmas Carol"". Bill Murry, TV producer is a selfish workaholic who will do anything to up the ratings for his station, including incorporating sexy dance numbers and violent explosions in their production of ""A Christmas Carol"". He makes everyone work producing a live Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve, so no one gets to spend Christmas Eve with their families.Bill Murry must be a really nice guy, because I did not think he was a convincing meany at all. But it's a kids movie, so that's okay. Bill's character's name is Frank Xavior Cross. At one time, there is a definition of ""Cross"" posted in the background as ""Something you nail people to"". Xavior is Latin for Savior, and Frank means ""honest"", so I liked this subtle reference to Christ in the movie.There are references to things in the '80's. Bill Murry has a mullet haircut at one point. He drinks Bacardi with Tab. He has a vision of a man on fire and he mentions Richard Pryor. They show a film clip that has a ""drive-by shooting"". The thrill of Ginsu knives. Reference to Chernobyl. Mary Lou Rhetton is also in the movie.One of the best parts is the Ghost of Christmas Present. Carol Kane is dressed like a frothy pink fairy princess, and she imitates the sweet, trilling voice of Glenda the Good Witch of the North, but she constantly bops, pokes and tweaks Bill Murry every chance she gets, like Moe of the Three Stooges.The ending was my favorite part: super feel-good ending. Bill talks to everyone, including the viewing audience about being nice, kind and wonderful; about being the kind of person that you know you should be. Everyone bursts into song and Bill looks right at the camera and encourages us to sing along! Wonderful!",Scrooged
172,firstalittlebackstory,"A dismal, dreary film with no clear purpose",2,13 December 2008,"Bill Murray stumbles through this muddled mishmash of Christmas clichés and vague references to the classic Dickens characters. Scrooged is an ugly mess punctuated by random, unnecessary violence and sexual innuendo. This is indeed a dark film, as other reviewers have noted, but without a deeper meaning or purpose. The writers seem to have written it simply for the dubious pleasure of wallowing in their hatred for the holiday itself.The predictable ending, which is nauseating in its insincerity, made me cringe with embarrassment for Murray. He rants madly about how he ""gets it"" and beseeches viewers to spread a little Christmas cheer and goodwill into their everyday lives. And then he smarms his way through a humiliating routine that lasts well into the credits, complete with a ""Feed me, Seymour!"" reference to his previous cameo in Little Shop of Horrors.I remember enjoying Scrooged when I was a child; now I wonder why my parents allowed me to watch such pointless, inappropriately sexual and violent ""Christmas"" dreck.

173,Giles_Corey,Flawed dark comedy,7,12 January 2018,"I remember watching this in the theater when it first came out and recently watched it for the first time since then on Starz. I felt the same way today as I did back then; some really dark yet funny segments but very flawed by the crow-barred romance with actress Karen Allen. The scenes with the homeless characters were integral to the darkness of the movie and the Murray's interaction with a dead Michael J Pollard is classic. I chuckled at the dig of Trump Tower in that scene. However; a different angle could have been used other than using the completely trite and weighty romance between Murray and Allen to get to those scenes. The Murray character in that movie would NEVER have been with such a cliche nice girl character like Allen. A shallow pursuit of some busty chick who happened to volunteer at the homeless center would have done the trick. 
David Johansen and Carol Kane steal the scene from Murray who literally chews on the scenery to create a total focus on his character and that is a good thing. The complete immersion of the viewer into Bill Murray needed those breaks. 
The sappy eighties ending is pretty much a sign of the times and the haircuts and outfits gave me the shudders when I remember them. 
Very good movie, could have been better, and I suspect that Murray himself undermined what could have been.
I do not understand the reviews that focus on the Dickens story. This is NOT a retelling of the Dickens story. This is a story about a TV executive who happens to be making a live extravaganza using the Dickens story as codpiece. Seven stars for what could have been a ten star classic.",Scrooged

180,brienmalone,Relegated to Cult Status?,10,20 February 2005,"It's sad to me that this movie missed the mark with so many people. Those who are attracted by its cynicism can't seem to get past the sweet ending. Those who like the ending can't seem to get past the dark biting cynicism. Personally, I thought Donner did a great job marrying the two.The Scrooge tale is about reformation. A miserly man is given a third person view of his miserly life and where it will lead. Armed with insight and a second chance, he attacks his life anew. Its a fine supportable theme that reinforces a good message.Would this film have been better if the ending had challenged this notion? Maybe Frank Cross decides 'Ok... Be a miserly jerk now and burn in a box later... or be nice, charitable and ... huh... OK... what is my motivation here?' And with that, we close with him super-gluing antlers on a mouse. Funny? Yes. True to life? Well, more so than the sappy ending, that's for sure.The cynical ending is more in keeping with 1998 than 1988. Remember, in 1988, yuppism was new and in full swing. The late 20 and early 30-somethings were riding high on Reganomics and living for capitalism. It was such a new idea, that the soft underbelly of America felt it needed to remind the suits that it pays to have a heart. Interestingly enough, that was the mode of 1843, too when Dickens wrote his tale.1998 saw goth go mainstream. We saw our president lie about a sex scandal... Saving Private Ryan was the ""big movie"" of the year (a group of soldiers risk their lives to save one soldier who didn't want to be saved). America was in a more cynical mode. (7 years later, we're more cynical, still.) Would a cynical ending have been better? I believe it would have won more acclaim. I could see the critics slathering Scrooged with complements for its fresh take and keen insight... but better? I don't know. Personally, I like the movie just as it is.",Scrooged
181,CRJtheFirst,"Starts off promisingly, but falls flat in the end",4,25 December 2015,"Bill Murray in the 80s, one of the most charismatic actors to ever walk this planet, stars in this parody of the classic Dickens novel. It's directed by Richard Donner, who also directed 'The Omen' in the 70s, one of my favorite movies of all time. That movie is dark, terrifying and I really recommend every horror fan to check it out. I was really excited to watch this on Christmas. How could such a duo deliver anything but brilliance?Urgh...The first half an hour is actually fine and pretty fun. Murray plays a giant douche who does all the Scrooge stuff you'd expect in a modern setting. Most jokes work and it made me laugh a bunch. The jokes start to fail once the first ghost shows up. He is not really that funny and they just follow the regular Christmas Carol scenes that you would expect in a straight-up adaptation. But Murray temporarily saves the movie and stops it from becoming boring. Temporarily...The movie dies once the second ghost shows up, played by Carol Kane. She is the least funny person I've seen in a comedy in a long time and ruins this entire part. Even worse, the story now continues on very predictably...The ending is incredibly boring. This is where the movie stops to be a parody and just follows the regular story of Christmas Carol, a pretty mediocre one at that. The ending would have worked far better if they had chosen to give it a twist (Blackadder style) and given Murray a better script to work with. At the end, he breaks the fourth wall and starts to ramble at the audience, which I'm assuming was done for comedic purposes but falls flat.I don't recommend Scrooged, unless you want something for your kids at Christmas.

Some Christmas movies don't need an ""80's excess"" makeover, in my opinion.",Scrooged
191,dreycam,it's just not that funny,4,19 December 2005,"I haven't read all the comments, but I notice that many folks are wondering why this movie has negative reviews, thinking some people can't handle its ""dark"" nature or Frank Cross' nastiness. In fact, I love dark comedies and think Frank Cross is the movie's saving grace (Bill Murray's brilliance manages to shine through mediocrity once again).I think the problem is that this movie just not nearly as funny as it thinks it is. Much of it is tedious and labored. Some think Carol Kane is hilarious, but I found her downright annoying (I think she is better in less broad comedic roles). And the level of violence is just gratuitous and takes way too much away from the comedy. The only time it is effective in creating comedy is in the opening sequence for the Lee Major's movie. Isn't it ironic that the movie starts out making fun of violence for violence sake, and then proceeds to become the very thing it makes fun of.This had potential to be a very good movie, but did not succeed due to some of the factors cited above. I did not enjoy it much upon second viewing, whereas I can watch ""Groundhog Day"" over and over again.",Scrooged
192,Bwana-2,I get it now!,8,23 December 2000,"I just finished watching this film (on TNT) for the countless time. What a fine seasonal offering. It's so much better than a lot of the pulp and smarmy c*** that passes for Christmas classics.Bill Murray exclaims at the end of the movie, ""I get it now!"" Apparently, some folks watched this flick and didn't get it. The movie is essentially a star turn for Murray, who's in almost every frame - and that's fine with me because he can carry a film. Trivial quibbles over the movie's name and reference to the original work, the lack of faithfulness to the book and other complaints miss the point of the project. While staging a production of 'A Christmas Carol,' a TV executive experiences the very same circumstances as one of the characters in the novel. That alone makes it work. A few reviews question the overall harsh tone of the movie, or more specifically, Murray's role. Frankly, I would not have minded had it been even a little darker. There's a lot of water to carry in that bucket of trying to measure the callous and thoughtless manner in which some folks act on all but the most treasured of holidays. Murray's demeanour boils it down into one strong mean spirit and evaporates it with a truly positive and well-wishing finale.Scrooged is, along with Groundhog Day, among his best work.",Scrooged

194,rrlee2250,this movie is extremely underrated.,10,16 December 2006,"GREAT MOVIE! this is a movie that I never tire of watching. It is one of Bill Murray's best performances. Very clever casting, love the ghosts. When it comes to Christmas classics, this film ranks right up there with Miracle on 34th Street, etc. I happened to catch an airing of ""Chasing Christmas,"" starring Tom Arnold. In this production, there were a couple of lines in the script that appeared to pay ""homage"" to ""Scrooged."" That to me is Tom Arnold's way of acknowledging Bill Murray's talent. I you haven't seen this either film, I highly recommend both. Scrooged was directed by Richard Donner of Lethal Weapon fame. He borrowed a couple actors from that film. This demonstrates versatility. THIS A FUN FILM!",Scrooged

Mercifully, I fell asleep. I don't care that the movie is mean-spirited - so is ""Bad Santa, but that movie is funny.

For those with faith. For those who are responsible sensitive caring human beings... this HAS to be an amazing film.The message is centuries old... from the Bible and before ON the good messages are everlasting. Good and Evil is a pretty clear cut thing in life... they're very easy to tell apart to those who are as they should be.I loved this film. If I could I would rent a theater every couple months and invite all the people who ""get this"" movie... to come truly have fellowship with one another... a great time had by all.Do yourself a favor if you're a person who relates to being a do-gooder. Check out this film. You ""shouldn't"" be disappointed. It's truly a miracle movie and I'm still blown away that it was even ever made. OUTSTANDING film.Thanks and God bless! MJK",Scrooged
199,max-willey,Worst film I've seen for ages,2,13 December 2020,"I've always enjoyed Bill Murray's films but this one is garbage.
I was not engaged or drawn in to the movie at all which is unusual for me. It felt like scenes were rushed to reduce the length of the movie which made it confusing at times (who were those homeless people in the soup kitchen and how/why did they know Kross?). I ended up not caring in the slightest what happened.
I'm amazed it gets so many good reviews here.",Scrooged
200,vmancini218c2000,A Good Christmas Movie,7,16 December 2008,"There's no point spending too much time going over the story because we're all familiar with it. It's a modern retelling of ""A Christmas Carol"" with Bill Murray in the lead, as the meanest TV exec you could imagine. Modern retellings can be tricky to pull off as they can often be unnecessary and uninspired but this is neither. The setting and characters all work to create a dark comedy treat that's fun to watch at the holliday season. That being said, I have to say that I would give the movie 3 stars and not 4. Although it's a comedy, you wont be belly laughing every minute. There are some really funny parts, but other parts are more ""amusing"" than funny; thankfully, the jokes never fall flat. As far as drama goes, it probably won't have you choked up the way other versions of the Dickens classic would. So, you're reading this saying ""It's a comedy that could be funnier and a drama that could be more emotional. Doesn't sound all that great."" What makes the movie worthwhile though is the combination of drama and comedy. It's a clever idea pulled off by great acting, that's the other thing that needs mention. Bill Muray is not only funny, but he can really act and he pulls the movie off, along with great supporting work from the rest of the cast. All in all, definitely worth a viewing during the X-Mas season.",Scrooged
201,christopherjsingleton1,"There were Rudolph, Charlie Brown, and the Griswold family, but few might have heard the best of them all BILL MURRAY! Wait what?",8,7 April 2014,"Scrooged""Scrooged"" is like a wild animal, going all over the place acting all crazy. Throwing everything they can think of in your face. Adult humor, goofy humor, really dark moments, all kinds of weird stuff. Then an animal tamer (director Richard Donner) comes in to put the animal back in focus. Showing him that he is still a ""A Christmas Carol"" modern day retelling that is suppose to be heartwarming. Still make it funny and goofy, but not go to far. Finally just to be an entertaining time for tourists. Which made me give this attraction a thumbs up.The story is about a man named Francis Xavier Cross (Bill Murray) a TV executive who is a cruel harsh jerk that loves to humiliate and torment his co-workers. In order to boost his career and keep it alive, also he loves the holiday season. For the reason of all the commercial during the time. Making a giant live TV special of ""A Christmas Carol"" due to as he puts it ""All these little idiots are going to be watching the boob tube."" He gets visited the night before Christmas Eve by the ghost of his old business partner Lew (John Forsythe) telling him he's going to be visited by the three ghosts of Christmas. The Past, Present, and Future to show him at he error of his ways. So things do get a little chaotic. Now he must either learn the way to live, or spent the rest of his life ruining other people lives.Half of the charm of the movie comes from how inventive the story is when it comes to ""A Christmas Carol."" It finds ways to still keep you engaged with the plot even though you know what's going to happen. For example Bob Cratchit from the original has been split up into two characters. Bobcat Goldthwait's character who is really funny, and Alfre Woodard's character who is likable and the mother of the Timmy Tim of the movie. (Which is not sick in the movie if you read the Charles Dickens book). The other charm of the movie is the humor, mostly due to Bill Murray. He is one of those actors who can play those jerk protagonist, and the writers took that to a full extent. His character is a harsh, cruel, mean dirt-bag, doing some very nasty stuff. Like reacting really gladly to the fact that the crazy commercial he made for ""A Christmas Carol"" was an old lady having a heart attack once she saw it. But he is so fun to watch as he does this harsh because he knows how to make at least funny. He has done this kind of role before, so he has some experience. Saying he is just funny is more of an understatement. He is also really emotionally dramatic at times, giving off some very believable emotional performances. Due to that we actually learn a lot about this guy threw the movie, and his setup was also really good too. He is definitely the best character in the movie. The more I think about it I think the only reason people went to work on this movie is because Bill Murray was in it and he was big back in the 80s. Doing popular movies like ""Caddyshack,"" ""Stripes,"" and probably his most famous ""Ghostbusters."" Speaking of the characters all the other people in the movie are really enjoyable too. Karen Allen as Frank's girlfriend brings a likable charm to the character that would put a smile on your face. John Fortsythe as Frank's old business partner was nice to see for his little scene. David Johansen was fun to watch as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christmas Present gets kind of annoying at times but I still enjoyed seeing her on screen. It's just a fun batch of characters that were all likable and entertaining in their own way.Although the movie is not for everyone (due to it getting a mixed reaction). There will be some things in the movie that might annoy people, or just make them go ""Whaaaat?"" Like the fact that the opening of the movie is (I kid you not) a terrorist attack at Santa's Workshop. Then again I never thought it was too annoying, since the movie also is a satire of pop culture, and that part was making fun of the weird Santa Claus movies in the 30s - 50s. Ones like ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians."" Also I don't feel this is the first movie you should watch when you want to get the Christmas feeling. But at the same time I'm not sure about that, because the director keeps everything in focus. Still trying to get the magic Christmas spark, and Bill Murray does get the emotional parts right. Even though some might kinda fall flat to people.In the end ""Scrooged"" is a movie that depends on how you look at it. If you're one of those people who loves the heartwarming Christmas classics like ""Miracle on 34th Street"" or ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" this most likely won't please you. But if you're one of those people who is a fan of Bill Murray and likes a good Christmas comedy like ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" there is a good chance you'll like this movie. I still recommend it to at least try the movie, because the negative people might find something enjoyable in the movie. Me I really enjoyed the movie. I don't think it will be fondly remembered in the future, but I'll still remember it years later in the Christmas Future.",Scrooged
