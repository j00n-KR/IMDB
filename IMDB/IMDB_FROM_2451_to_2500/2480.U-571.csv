0,Leofwine_draca,Claustrophobic submarine thriller is a real treat,9,23 November 2016,"U-571 garnered a lot of negative publicity on first release, due to the fact that it's completely historically inaccurate – the Brits were the ones who captured the first Enigma machine, not the Yanks. Still, inaccuracies aside – and let's face it, a LOT of Hollywood films are far from the truth – it's best to remember that this is a movie, nothing more, nothing less, designed to entertain and that's it. And I'm pleased to say that it's VERY entertaining.Submarine thrillers have been fairly rare over the last couple of decades; everyone remembers DAS BOOT, the classic German miniseries, but there are no films so to speak of other than THE HUNT FOR RED October and CRIMSON TIDE. U-571 seeks to re-address that, presenting a taut thriller that mainly takes place in a single location. The good news is that Jonathan Mostow is the director, and he wrings every ounce of suspense, tension, and atmosphere from his confined setting. Mostow is that rare beast – a director who manages to turn even lacklustre scripts into entertaining movies; see TERMINATOR 3 for a case in point. His earlier BREAKDOWN, a fantastic thriller with Kurt Russell, remains a favourite and U-571 is just as entertaining as that movie.Being a Hollywood movie, there are the requisite number of clichés and outlandish situations, but the premise seems fresh and the film is bolstered by some brilliant action scenes that make great use of CGI effects for a change. The cast have no choice but to give it their all; this is an ensemble outing and there's no hiding from the camera. Harvey Keitel is fine as the elder statesman, letting his younger co-stars do the hard work; Matthew McConaughey, an actor I usually dislike, is actually very good as the wannabe-captain. Elsewhere, the well-established likes of Bill Paxton and Elias Koteas fill out character roles, and there are two unusual casting choices: a bit part for cheeky chappy Robin Askwith, best known for his performances in '70s comedies like CONFESSIONS OF A WINDOW CLEANER, and a supporting role for musician Jon Bon Jovi, who is actually pretty decent. This is a frequently edge-of-your-seat film that packs in some great twists. After the initial set-up it keeps pounding away until the ending, and I enjoyed every minute; a minor classic for sure that just looks better and better as the years pass.",U-571
1,SnoopyStyle,Lots of water and lots of action,5,3 September 2014,"In the spring of 1942, the U-boats are taking a toll on Allies shipping. The Allies need to capture an Enigma machine and code books without the Germans knowing it's gone. Lt. Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) thinks he deserves his own command. However there's a special mission for him to use an old U-boat to pose as the resupply boat to capture a disabled German U-boat and steal their intel before they can destroy it. Lt. Cmdr. Dahlgren (Bill Paxton)is the skipper. Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) is a German speaker with the special mission. Maj. Coonan (David Keith) is naval intelligence. Just when they succeed in capturing a disabled U-boat, their boat is attacked and sunk leaving them a crippled boat in enemy waters but they can't contact home or else the Germans will know that their codes are compromised. Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, Erik Palladino and Will Estes play some of the crew.The action gets pretty good. It's big with lots of water and explosions. However it never gets beyond a Hollywood version of a submarine movie. It has its good points. The acting is alright but McConaughey is a little overwhelmed. There is a little too much big acting going on. Everything is done at the highest level of drama. It's very bombastic and doesn't spend a lot of time taking a breather. It's like a heavy meal of junk food that is soon forgotten.",U-571
2,Hitchcoc,"Boy, were these guys lucky",6,15 August 2001,"I don't know. When you get the message that a submarine can only withstand so much pressure, you know darn well that it's going to exceed it. Can you imagine if the sub had been crushed like the egg when it first encountered its maximum stress. They must have dropped 500 depth charges but the darned thing just wouldn't give in. Then we have the torpedo fired like a dying gunfighter as he breathes his last going right on target; and was that some torpedo. With torpedoes like that, I'm surprised we needed to drop a bomb on Hiroshima. One of those would have erased Japan from the map.I know I'm nit-picking because I know we need to suspend a little disbelief here, but there is a claim of authenticity that just doesn't work. The other thing that bugged me. Why didn't the guy (the one who gets the ""You can do it"" pep talk) use a rope or a hook of some kind to pull on the lever.Why did he have to use a fully extended arm. Also, why did they let that German prisoner live and sabotage things for so lon. They had no trouble blowing away the rest of them. My guess is that the director needed to throw another obstacle and show how devious the enemy could be. Well, you get the point. This is one of those films where I started with a reasonably high opinion and as I thought about it, realized how poorly constructed it was. I liked the acting.",U-571
3,Prismark10,It is an enigma,5,4 August 2013,"I guess somewhere in the pitch for this movie. There was an attempt to replicate the tense atmosphere of Das Boot with a true life story.The film takes place in 1942, a US submarine is in the Atlantic looking for a stricken German U-boat.Posing as a German supply crew, they plan to board the U-571 and steal the Enigma machine, the device the Nazis used to send coded messages.The film ends with the director putting on a title card dedicating the film to the memory of the real sailors who captured Enigma machines who were British sailors to be more exact, something this film glosses over.Historical accuracy and this film are total strangers.However this is not to say the film is entertaining, it is well made, McConaughey does his bland best but is out-blanded by Jon Bon Jovi.Stern support is provided by Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel.",U-571
4,classicsoncall,"""You've come to the right boat.""",7,29 August 2020,"I'll often seek out a movie about submarine action because they always involve a suspense factor that's built into the plot. How can they not, the story takes place in a confined space with no way out if trouble develops. That this one is entirely fictional shouldn't dissuade potential viewers. The ensemble cast gives it their all in a World War II setting that pits an American sub team dispatched to steal a German Enigma cipher machine, from another submarine no less. Matthew McConaughey's character is Lieutenant Andy Tyler, initially bypassed for his own submarine command, but who rises to the occasion when Captain Dahlgren is left to drown in a pitched battle against a Nazi sub crew in open water. The moment is poignant, because the reason Dahlgren didn't recommend Tyler for promotion was his hesitation about putting men at death's door.There are credibility defying moments in the story as one finds in almost all wartime sub movies. Here, the German submarine, commandeered by the Americans after theirs is destroyed, is taken almost a hundred meters below safety level with the attendant pipes bursting and crew fearing for their lives. Taking the attack to a Nazi destroyer on the surface, a precision shot takes out the radio tower, and it's a combination of miraculous timing and uncommon bravery that sees the crew achieve success on their mission.As far as submarine movies go, this one was about in the middle for it's action and suspense. I don't think any film will ever top the 1981 thriller ""Das Boot"", though other fine ones include 1990's ""The Hunt for Red October"", and a couple from the Fifties, ""The Enemy Below"" and ""Run Silent, Run Deep"". Among more current films, this one compares favorably with 2002's ""The Widdowmaker"" and the more recent ""Hunter Killer"". And if you're intrigued by the idea of the German Enigma machine, you'll want to catch ""The Imitation Game"" to learn how the Enigma code was eventually cracked, even if liberties were taken with the actual history. Also, the story takes place entirely on dry land.",U-571
5,lee_eisenberg,U turned,7,8 November 2006,"As I understand it, ""U-571"" is less than totally accurate, as it was actually the English who captured the Nazi submarine and figured out the code. But ignoring that, the movie is still quite fun, as the American crew sees their duty and won't let anything stand in their way. I will say that the portrayal of the Germans could have been better (""Das Boot"" showed how they weren't really Nazis, some were just drafted; this one makes them all look like Nazis).But anyway, the whole thing is pretty fun to watch, without any sappy love scenes to drag it down. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel and David Keith.",U-571
6,jboothmillard,u-571,5,11 May 2017,"I remember hearing the title of this film, I recognised it was something to do with a submarine or ship, but I was also attracted to it by the all-star cast in it, directed by Jonathan Mostow (Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Surrogates). Basically set in World War II, allied forces have been having trouble against the German Navy, especially their U-Boats, because of their highly sophisticated cipher machines and the Enigma code. One German U-Boat is damaged and awaits assistance, the Americans decide that this incidence is an opportunity for them to get the cipher machine. So they have a submarine made up to resemble a German U-Boat, it is called U-571, and they plan to pretend to be the ship sent to assist the damaged U-Boat, to take control and take the machine and destroy it. Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) takes command of U-571, after Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) is seriously wounded during a torpedo attack on his ship, other crew members include Chief Gunner's Mate Henry Klough (Harvey Keitel), and Lieutenant Pete Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi). Everything goes according to plan, they get the machine and are ready to leave, but out of nowhere they are torpedoed by a German relief ship, initially Dahlgren did not feel Tyler was ready to make tough decisions, now that he is commanding he and the survivors must do whatever it takes tor survive. Also starring David Keith as Major Matthew Coonan, King Kong's Thomas Kretschmann as Captain-Lieutenant Gunther Wassner, Homeland's Jake Weber as Lieutenant Hirsch, Jack Noseworthy as Seaman Bill Wentz, Tom Guiry as Seaman Ted 'Trigger' Fitzgerald, Will Estes as Seaman Ronald 'Rabbit' Parker and Final Destination 2's Terrence 'T.C.' Carson as Steward Eddie Carson. The cast of Americans are all alright, but you cannot believe the story, because it was the British who got hold of the Enigma cipher machine, it is definitely a fictional story, this is essentially just popcorn fodder, nonsense, but with plenty of exciting explosions and engaging enough underwater battle sequences, a reasonable Second World War action thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Sound. Worth watching!",U-571
7,ccthemovieman-1,Involving WWII Story,8,16 April 2006,"Somebody looking for an intense World War II film that has a few shocking twists, can't go too wrong with this movie. My only faults with it are that sometimes it goes a bit long on the depth-charge action scenes and that the language is too rough for a PG-13. Otherwise, this is good entertainment and certainly a different kind of World War II story. Does it stretch credibility? Yes, but most action movies do, so you ride with it.For a submarine movie, it has far more action than most, with half of it outside the sub instead of inside as so often the case. It also looks great on DVD and offers some outstanding 5.1 surround sound. There is a huge difference in viewing this on VHS and on DVD.This is definitely a man's movie with an all-male cast of tough seamen fighting tough Nazi seamen in the middle of WWII. Matthew McConaughey and Harvey Keitel are the two main stars and it's a bit odd to see the veteran Keitel taking orders from the ""kid.""",U-571
8,rmax304823,Silly Fictional Submarine Fare.,2,2 January 2009,"There really isn't much to be said about this hokey story of an event that never happened during World War II. The movie involves ratty German U-boat sailors, scared but brave and religious American sailors, the capture of a German coding device called Enigma that we already had, impossible triple somersaults in the incidents -- and every submarine cliché in the cinematic code book.The main plot has an American crew trying to maneuver a damaged U-boat into an Allied port while simultaneously keeping it afloat, causing it to move, avoiding the Germans who are searching frantically for it, and meanwhile being attacked by another German submarine and a German destroyer. I had a bit of trouble keeping that all-American crew straight. They're all blandly even featured, except for Harvey Keitel who definitely is in the wrong movie.The B story is about the Lieutenant in charge, about his character, about the crew's doubts, about whether or not he has the guts to command and order men to their deaths. (Guess whether he does or not.) The writers, producers, and director have absorbed lessons from other submarine movies, from ""Destination Tokyo"" to ""Das Boot."" At one point, the captain has to dive to plutonian depths the U-boat was never designed for and we can watch the arrow on the familiar Tiefenmesser mope its way into the red part of the dial -- and then beyond -- while the hull creaks from the increasing pressure. The men hold onto fittings and gawk at the bulkheads and one of them mutters, ""Man, them Krauts sure know how to build 'em."" (Cf: KaEl Curt Jurgens' line in ""The Enemy Below"" under identical circumstances, ""They build them good in Germany, huh?"") So the hull is creaking and the men are scared to death and the minatory destroyer circles overhead and the only lights are from feeble portable lamps and flashlights and I'm thinking, ""Wait a minute! Where are the popping bolts? Where's the squirting water and the shattered glass instruments?"" Didn't have long to wait.To trick the destroyer into believing that the U-boat has sunk, the captain has fuel released from the tanks and shoots some debris from one of the torpedo tubes. The debris includes a dead conveniently body, as in -- which one was it? -- ""Run Silent, Run Deep""? You know, the one with Clark Gable? Not that the sleight-of-hand works. If it did, we would be deprived of the thrill of watching the pursuing destroyer blown out of the water with the wounded submarine's lone remaining torpedo.The clichés never seem to end, and they're not drawn entirely from the submarine genre either. Two men -- one good guy and one bad guy -- are struggling face to face with a pistol between them. A shot is heard. The struggle stops. The good guy wears a shocked expression and backs slowly away. The bad guy smiles slightly -- and then slumps dead to the deck. I'm fairly sure the first time such a scene was presented to the public was in a comedy by Aristophanes.Where was I? Think I had a period of microsleep there. Anyway, there are thrills galore during the action sequences that seem to comprise half the movie. The cuts are instantaneous. Depth charge patterns yield a dozen explosions in speedy sequence. The camera jiggles. The men dash about, shouting. Lights flash on and off. Sparks fly like the Fourth of July. The chuckling director darts for a second in front of the camera lens and gives the audience the finger. BANG! BOOM! ""She's coming apart!""Want to see a submarine movie you can believe? Rent ""Das Boot."" Of course ""Das Boot"" is long, precisely observed, contains some leisure moments that tell us things about individuals, and it has subtitles, so if ""U 571"" is your kind of movie, ""Das Boot"" probably is not.",U-571
9,ma-cortes,US sub captained by Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey set out to capture U-boot with Enigma coding device,7,12 March 2011,"The yarn is interesting and based on real deeds with thrilling screenplay and authoritative direction by Jonathan Mostow. There are suspense, thriller and action, though the scenario is mostly into submarines . This exciting underwater drama concerns about stirring battles between US and German submarines . Bill Paxton stars as a veteran commander who is scheming a dangerous voyage to capture a stricken U-boat carrying the enigma coding device and solid Mathew McConaughey as the second in command who attempts anticipate his every move. Tensions run high and rise between commandant Mike Dahlgren and Lt. Andrew Tyler and the crew as they set out from a port to take and destroy the German sub . The crew as Harvey Keitel , Jake Weber , Jon Bon Jovi , Tom Guiry , Will Estes , Erik Palladino are pushed to the brink of death by risked mission full of dangers , twists and turns. The film is famous as one of the best and recent WWII submarine movies .This nail-biter is a tightly-knit drama centered on the sea maneuvers going after the mightiest battle submarines of the Atlantic Ocean that are decimating the Allied convoys . The motion picture is meticulously mounted by Jonathan Mostow who always manages to make a course correction in the nick of time and deliver another direct success . Impressive, rousing musical score by Richard Marvin and appropriate, colorful cinematography by Oliver Wood. Perfect production design by Gotz Weidner who also made 'Das Boot' .The film belongs to submarine genre, along with : ¨ Torpedo(1958) ¨ by Robert Wise with Burt Lancaster and Clark Gable 'Torpedo run(1958)' by Joseph Pevney with Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine; 'Das Boot(1982)' by Wolfgang Petersen with Jurgen Prochnow; 'Hunt for red october(1990)' by John McTiernan with Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery ; 'Crimson tide' by Tony Scott with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman; 'K19' with Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson and in similar style ¨U-Boat(2004)¨ by Tony Giglio with Scott Caan , William H Macy and of course Tomas Kretschmann who in U-571 also stars a German officer , as usual .The movie produced by the great producer Dino De Laurentiis is based on historic deeds , thus the construction of new U-boats continued at a record -breaking during WWII. In 1942-43 Hitler raised enormously his U-boat strength,the German submarines sank numerous ships,in early 1943 the called ¨Wolf packs¨sank 90 ships in 20 days.Then,suddenly ,between March and June 1943,an exceptional change took place .The Allies began to win the war against Hitler's underwater in the Battle of the Atlantic . By this time the technique of submarines warfare had advanced far beyond that used in the beginning the war.The Allies pitted thousands of boats,seamen,destroyers,cruisers,subs,cannons and billion of dollars against the undersea craft .As early as December 1943 Karl Doeniz ,the architect and designer of U-boat campaign,admitted the grave turn in events . The cost was great on both sides .In the six years of war ,the Germans,by their own statistics,destroyed more than 2000 British,Allied ships in the sea.Hitler had built 1162 subs ,of which 783 were lost.Of the 41000 men recruited into the underwater service ,between 28000 and 32000 lost their lives and 500 were taken prisoners.The film provides a realistic detailing of life aboard and a portrait about the crews subjected to stressful and psychological tensions . In fact the sailors had sleep in shifts.For months they were lodged in close quarters because every inch the space was needed for machinery,supplies and torpedoes.The air was heavy with odors from bilges,diesel oil and unwashed bodies.The men faced sudden death from depth charges ,aerial bombing attacks or the sharp bow of a swift destroyer as happen in this film. The movie that achieved big hit , will appeal to action enthusiasts and WWII aficionados. Rating 7/10 , above average .",U-571
10,Quinoa1984,Great sub action,7,29 April 2000,"U-571 has great war action, but it needs a good story to back it up to be really a blockbuster, and I don't see the best story here (not as good as Das Boot anyway).  The story is a true one (switched from Britain to America as the heroes) in which a group of navy sub men need to find a stranded sub with a machine that will help them in the war.  Once they get to the ship and take over it though, teh Americans loose their sub and must board the Germans sub.  This is giving grave danger to them because they do not know what everything is in the sub, and everybody (Germans and Britains) will be looking for them.  Heart racing action and good stars (Matthew McConaghey, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi and Bill Paxton) bring this film to high hights, but the story is very thin under It's main plot, and I didn't find it all that interesting.  My pick for best sound and visual effects (if nothing else comes along) of the year.  A-",U-571
11,edwagreen,**1/2,6,5 March 2016,"Nice seeing Will Estes, Jaime of television's Blue Bloods in a minor role in this film.I think that the film basically torpedoes itself with the constant barrage of firing. Naturally, the scenes are confined to the ships whether they be above or below the ground and this is always a disadvantage to film viewers.Matthew McConaughey plays the guy who was told by his superior that he isn't ready to head a naval ship only for the one to tell him this dies on board and Matt steps up to the helm. Notice those bulging eyes of his as he directs the men to follow his orders. Harvey Keitel plays one of the men on board who is fiercely loyal to McConaughey and urges the others to do so. Interesting to see how McConaughey tells the men that we're not running a democracy here and they're to do what he tells them to do. The film becomes essentially a cat and mouse game with the Americans over powering a Nazi submarine while attempting to get a valuable recorder used by the Germans to communicate with Berlin.",U-571
12,michaelRokeefe,Hard choices get the job done. Survival is hard earned.,7,6 December 2000,"Very good submarine flick. Twisted portrayal of history. In 1942, German U-Boats dominate the North Atlantic and sink Allied supply ships at will. A special mission is designed for an American submarine to disguise itself and crew as German in order to capture a German Code machine. The Enigma Code was very crucial in the Nazi naval war effort. This movie is an action packed two hours. The tension runs high. And the suspense is hard and rampant. The characters earn your concern for their survival.A very talented and hard working cast that features Matthew McConaughey and a sharp and surprising effort from Jon Bon Jovi. (Yes, the singer). Also turning in very fine performances are Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, David Keith and Erik Palladino.",U-571
13,hitchcockthelegend,Can you forgive the film makers their sins?,6,23 June 2015,"Once in a while there comes a time when a film lover has their patience snapped, that we can't surely accept in this instance that poetic license is OK as an excuse purely for Hollywood to make a piece of entertainment. U-571 pretty much rips up the history books for its own ends, something that would see even the film makers themselves bow their heads during the years that followed. However... As a drama - cum - thriller, Jonathan Mostow's film is top end. There's some iffy acting in the support slots, but the production is still excellently put together. Suspense down below in the submarine is high anxiety, the tactics of war in the Atlantic superbly written, while the finale face off is edge of the seat gripping. It's these things that has let U-571 gain decent ratings on the main internet movie sites. Taken as a piece of Hollywood guff, it's a rocking war movie, one that also sounds absolutely tremendous through home cinema systems. As long as you accept it as guff - regardless of your nationality, then there is a great time to be had. But just as with films like Braveheart, do familiarise yourselves with the facts afterwards. 6/10",U-571
14,LeonLouisRicci,History Be DamnedLet's Put on a Show,7,30 May 2014,"Explosive Submarine Actioner has the Burden of Betraying History in the Name of Xenophobic Credentials surely Made for America's Non-Discriminating, Pop-Corn Buying Audiences. With that Heaviness Sinking the Film for Historians, Purists, and the Cranky, it Manages for the Non-Thinkers to have a Pretty Good Time in an Old Fashioned way at the Movies.The Cast is Likable and the Look is Outstanding. The Booms use Every Dolby Decibel Available at the Turn of the Millennium and it Utilizes the Submarine Clichés with its Own bit of Brashness as if it has Never been done before.Overall, if You are Able to Ignore History, that at Times gets in the Way of Hollywood and is Discarded for Sometimes Incomprehensible Reasons, then this can be an Exciting Entertainment. After Ten Minutes there isn't a Skirt in Sight, so to say this is a Man's Movie is Stating the Obvious. It is and it Delivers to those Types a Reason to Pop a Beer and Pass the Pretzels.

15,lastliberal,Flawed remake of a classic,6,20 April 2007,"I was watching the 1981 film, Das Boot, the other night. The version that lasts just a shade under five hours. A tale of life on a submarine in war. Dirty, grimy, cramped terror in a way that only Wolfgang Peterson could present.Why would I want to see a remake that has so great a flaw to tell the story of the capture of the Enigma encoding machine by Americans. Anyone who knows history, knows that it was the British that captured that machine. Does Hollywood think we are stupid? I only tuned in to see Matthew McConaughey (Contact, A Time to Kill) and Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction). I enjoyed their performances in what was a flawed remake.",U-571
16,zardoz-13,Between A Depth Charge and A Deep Place,8,7 April 2008,"People that suffer from claustrophobia may crack under the pressure of watching the Matthew McConaughey movie ""U-571"" that emphasizes plot over character. Writer & director Jonathan (""Breakdown"") Mostow's white-knuckled World War II suspense yarn concerns a gallant group of U.S. Navy submariners that capture a Nazi U-boat and confiscate its ultra-secret Enigma decoding device. Predictably, this secret mission saga charts a hackneyed but hair-raising course with each cliffhanger situation dwarfing its predecessor until the action concludes with a slam-bang! Combine elements of director Dick Powell's ""The Enemy Below"" (1957) and Wolfgang Peterson's classic ""Das Boot!"" (1981) and you've got a fair idea what Mostow and co-scribes Sam Montgomery and David Ayer set their sights on with this rugged, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred nail-biter. Despite a raft of technical flaws (ranging from errors in naval rank to submarine technology and ultimately history itself), ""U-571"" excels as an above-average, adrenalin-drenched adventure about deep sea heroics. Seldom does a war movie rack your nerves, race your pulse, and make you squirm with such consummate skill as this seaworthy epic.""U-571"" imitates but never surpasses ""Das Boot."" This aquatic chronicle opens in the North Atlantic as a U-boat sinks an Allied supply ship. An Allied destroyer spots the Nazi sub and seeds the ocean with depth charges. The Germans escape by the skin of their teeth, but their engines conk out on them and all their mechanics are dead, leaving them stranded at sea. When the Americans learn about the disable sub, they launch a last minute mission to storm the ship and steal its Enigma decoder. The Enigma was a sophisticated super-typewriter that the German High Command used to communicate with its subs. If the Americans can steal an Enigma, they can cripple Hitler's wolf pack strategy which has enabled the Nazis to dominate the seas. Not only must they heist the decoder, but they also must either liquidate or take the entire crew hostage, so the Nazis will never suspect their decoder has fallen into enemy hands; otherwise, the Germans would change their codes. Accomplishing that ambitions feat turns out easier said than done.The U.S. Navy disguises the S-33, one of its vintage World War I submarines, as a U-boat. They hope the Germans will mistake it as one of their own when the rendezvous at sea occurs. Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (""Twister's"" Bill Paxton) skippers this leaky but reliable sardine can, while Matthew (""Contact"") McConaughey serves as executive officer Lt. Andrew Tyler. Tyler champs at the bit for his own command, but Dahlgren has torpedoed his ambitions. The skipper doesn't think Tyler has the guts to order men to sacrifice their lives for their country. Meanwhile, as the architects of this daring 'Trojan horse' night-time raid, German-speaking Lt. Hirsch (Jake ""Meet Joe Black"" Webber) and jaw-jutting Marine Major Coonan (David ""An Officer & A Gentleman"" Keith) come aboard before they cast off. Coonan plans to train the S-33 crew as his raiding party.""U-571"" does best what only upper echelon war movies can. Neither its heroes nor its audiences get a break. Overwhelming obstacles and even worse odds confound them at every turn. Surprises energize the lean, mean plot, and events wax from bad to worse. The super-charged action never lags under Mostow's taut direction. Pacing is paramount here, and Mostow deep-sizes anything that doesn't enhance the headlong momentum. As the story unfolds, Mostow takes the heroes from the wild open spaces then bottles them and the viewer in the coffin-like confines of a U-boat. The harrowing depth charging sequence that punctuates the final reel will make you clench your teeth and know your fist. Deliberately, Mostow pares characterization to the bone. Of course, the usual stereotypes abound, but a persuasive cast breathes enough lift into them to make them interesting. The hero that wanted to captain a sub doesn't exactly get what he wants, but when he finds himself in command, he manages to make the best of a terrible situation.Matthew McConaughey of ""Dazed & Confused"" and Harvey Keitel of ""Bad Lieutenant"" take top acting honors. McConaughey shows more psychological depth and poise here as an angry young sub commander than he has in all his earlier films put together. As Lt. Andrew Tyler, he goes from being an officer scorned to an austere-minded commander. He learns the meaning of being second-in-command, of making decisions based on imperfect information that may prompt combat casualties. (Rent ""The Guns of Navarone"" if you don't get it.) Moreover, McConaughey's physical appearance compliments his performance. Hollywood actors all too often ignore the military rules about haircuts and wear their locks at lengths that no officer would dare. McConaughey has his hair shorn to the scalp. The variety of facial expressions he wears manifests the utter desperation that he feels as a green American submarine commander trapped inside a Nazi sub with nothing but his own wits to keep his crew and himself between a depth charge and a deep place. Meanwhile, cast against the grain in a genre new to him, seasoned actor Harvey Keitel provides solid support as the chief of the boat. He helps Lt. Tyler complete his transition from everybody's friend to a feared and respected Naval skipper.History buffs and navy specialists may not enjoy ""U-571"" as thoroughly as less demanding moviegoers. Keep in mind, this is Hollywood, not history. This frantic but formulaic actioneer deploys all the standard war movie clichés, but Mostow stages everything with such style and verve that he swamps the flaws. Despite all its blood and gore, a clearly inspirational message underscores ""U-571."" Every character in this weather-beaten yarn 'does their job' and never quits. Similarly, ""U-571"" does its job by never letting you off the hook until its thrilling conclusion.",U-571
17,grantss,Terrible,2,11 April 2019,"The fact that the list of stars of this movie includes Bill Paxton and Jon Bon Jovi should be an indication that it is craptacular, and it is, very. Historically inaccurate with a plot filled with holes and contrived events. Acting and direction are woeful. About the only good thing about it is the special effects.So bad and gratuitously explosion-filled it could have been directed by Michael Bay.If you want to watch a good WW2 submarine movie, watch Das Boot instead.",U-571
18,Boba_Fett1138,Much better then you expect it to be!,7,29 August 2003,"At first I was skeptic about this movie like everyone else, I mean a submarine action movie ??? Comon! But the movie actually turned out to be pretty good!It's always risky to make a submarine movie, it's very soon considered to be a ""Das Boot"" rip-off. And of course ""U-571"" is a ""Das Boot"" rip-off but it's a fun rip-off! The movie uses several elements from ""Das Boot"", even the beginning is a bit similar but still it's unique enough to be considered a good movie.It was surprising to see that it actually really was a well action packed movie. From a submarine movie you normally just don't expect this many action. You could really already see back then that Jonathan Mostow really is a great action movie director that has proved himself recently with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". It actually is pretty amazing to see how close ""U-571"" comes to creating a ""Das Boot"" like atmosphere.Of course the story is totally silly and unbelievable but should that immediately mean that it's a bad movie? The movie serves it's purpose and that's to entertain the viewer.The cast is fairly good but don't be tricked, Bill Paxton's role is actually very small and just a few minutes long. Matthew McConaughey is a great leading man and it's always a pleasure to see Harvey Keitel in a movie.Give it a shot, you might like it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",U-571
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,That sinking feeling,7,28 March 2020,"This is a Dirty Dozen style story about the Allies trying to get an Enigma machine. Many others on here have already pointed out all the historical inaccuracies. I don't have anything to add to that. It's frustrating to realize that many audience members will believe it did really happen the way this movie presents it. Although fortunately, we do today have The Imitation Game, which is a depiction far closer to reality of the significant challenges faced in cracking Nazi codes. I think the worst part is the demonization of Germans. It plays as though this was made around sixty years prior to when it actually came out. It is puzzling to see a country that is a strong ally of America depicted as consisting entirely of one note evil villains. I guess it's one thing that at least they get to speak their native tongue, rather than English with an accent?If what I mentioned in the first paragraph bothers you a lot, then nothing in this movie makes up for it. If it doesn't, then essentially what you have here is a marriage of Das Boot and your typical Hollywood patriotic war flick. It's shamelessly cheesy without being obnoxiously over-stylized like Michael Bay's work. The dialogue, acting and directing are fairly bland. The action is competent, something Jonathan Mostow tends to manage on a regular basis. He might be the only person who worked on this who hasn't done much better elsewhere.I recommend this to those who love, as I saw someone else perfectly expressed it, ""military porn"". My final rating is for them, and based on the technical aspects of this. 7/10",U-571
20,view_and_review,A Real Gem,10,29 December 2020,"This movie had my undivided attention. I was clinging to every word, every command, every action. ""U-571"" had a vise grip on me that didn't ease until the final credits.The U.S. Navy was given an important mission: intercept a German U-boat and acquire their Enigma code breaker. The U.S. Navy would have to get to them before their supply ship does. For this task the Navy had an old German submarine and a couple of German speaking soldiers. They would use these tools to get aboard the German U-boat and steal the Enigma. The key is to do it before they can send an S.O.S. and before any other German ships in the area realize their Enigma has been stolen.The U.S. acquired German sub was skippered by Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) while Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) was the second in command. The plan was going fairly well until they were found out, then the proverbial bleep hit the fan and there wasn't a moment's reprieve after that.The few submarine movies I've seen are all epic. This one is probably my favorite though. It was as militarily strategic as ""The Hunt for Red October,"" as portentous as ""Crimson Tide,"" as claustrophobic as ""Das Boot,"" and as intense as all three put together. ""U-571"" is an excellent movie of the highest caliber. A real gem.",U-571
21,anaconda-40658,It Sinks and Stinks.,1,4 June 2015,"U-571 (2000): Dir: Jonathan Mostow / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Havey Keitel, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith: Based on a true story yet it has been made a zillion times because Hollywood believes that everyone should be subject to the same bs under as many different titles as possible. It regards the commandeering of a German submarine to gain access to its coding but the crew are trapped when their own ship is sunk. Deep in hostile waters they are not sure what action to take. My first suggestion would be to just leave the set. Mathew McConaughey plays a Navy Lieutenant who is denied the opportunity to command his own fleet. Harvey Keitel plays a chief who was active in the first World War and who trusts McConaughey's judgement. Directed by Jonathan Mostow who made the much more suspenseful Breakdown. McConaughey and Keitel are at the mercy of flat material, and Bill Paxton and Jon Bon Jovi yell over loud noise. This is an example of taking a cast of great potential and giving them absolutely nothing worth them showing up for. This film is about as suspenseful as a game of Battleship. We are suppose to be impressed with special effects that are nothing new and give off the same appeal as a rusted car. This farce ranks among the worst of war films resulting in the umpteenth stupid cliché filled disaster film that nobody asked for. Score: 1 / 10",U-571
22,phd_travel,Confusing and unbelievable,3,6 September 2016,If you accept it as a fictional submarine battle movie than it's an okay watch for die hard WW2 movie fans. But bear in mind there are some faults. The first storming of the U571 was confusing with too much machine gun fire and it was hard to keep track of what happened to some of the characters. That's simply bad directing. Later on there were too many violent explosions on the submarine for them not to have sunk immediately. Sometimes less is more. Things get a outrageously unbelievable as the battle proceeds.There was some noise about historical inaccuracies but face it would Hollywood make a movie about British finding an Enigma machine in a submarine? How are they going to put Matthew McConaughey in it?,U-571
23,Aaron1375,"It was an action movie, not a historic recount so for what it was I enjoyed it.",7,29 October 2010,"A lot of movies use historical events such as wars or tragedies as backdrops for their movies. ""Titanic"" for instance was completely untrue for the most part. This movie for some reason had lots of people complaining about how Americans were not the first to find the decoder depicted in the film. So what? Really, some people are just so anal. If England wishes for the true story to be told make a documentary on the subject with their money. This is an action movie made with American dollars, this is not to be confused with fact, seriously did you look up the Titanic's manifest and see if that poor Jack or his love Rose was on it. The decoder was just a way to get some guys on a German U-boat so we could have a pretty good action movie. It was nothing to ponder or for historians to dissect, I mean did we believe that Forrest Gump was real too and that he was a very important person in American History too or what? The main problem I had with this one is that Matthew McConaughey is the lead in this one. I think someone else would have been better, though he was not to bad in this one. Just when I see him I usually think chick flick, though I did like him in ""Sahara"" too. So a nice action movie, with some good submarine battles, I preferred ""The Hunt Red October"" and I have heard the German film ""Das Boot"" is the superior submarine film of all of them, but have never seen that one. Would like to though, until then though I enjoyed this one and I realize the English were the first to find said decoder.",U-571
24,mm-39,Entertaining,6,13 May 2001,"This film is ok, and Bill Paxton plays a good role.  However, this film steered away from the facts.  The explosions were too close, it was the British who actually did this mission, and the story gets a little too unbelievable. There is tension, drama, and a message of what a good leader is.  These attributes save an otherwise unbelievable film.",U-571
25,siderite,Hollywood all the way. And what was Jon Bon Jovi doing in this movie anyway?,6,10 June 2005,"Cool US marines try to capture that elusive Enigma machine that does the decoding of radio messages, while stupid Germans are tricked again and again and again. The only good thing Germans do is build u-boats, and it comes in handy when a few of the Us get stranded on a damaged enemy sub and need to get the captured machine back into Allied hands.Well, I might exaggerate a little. This is clearly not such a puerile movie like the ones they did right after the war. I mean, there is a German prisoner that does all kind of bad things while trying to escape, thus giving credit to the Nazi navy, there are tough decisions that the skipper has to take, but overall the Americans are the good guys and the Germans are mindless killing drones.While reading the other user comments I realized that the movie isn't even accurate, so the only good thing about it remains the acting (come on, it wasn't bad) and the production. An enigma (pun intended) for me is why did Bon Jovi accept to play in this movie. He has shown he has actor qualities, he is a known public figure, what the hell did he think when he accepted a part with a sentence or two and a stupid death right at the start?Conclusion: you want to know how people felt inside u-boats, read books or at least watch documentaries.

28,sddavis63,A Perfect 10 In Every Way,10,5 May 2001,"I was glued to the edge of my seat from the start to the finish of this magnificent account of the crew of a US Navy submarine given the mission of boarding a German U-Boat in World War II to capture a top-secret German coding device known as ""Enigma.""This movie is action-packed and full of suspense. A dull moment never intrudes on your enjoyment of it. Matthew McConnaughy is brilliant as Lieutenant Andrew Tyler. In addition to the sheer excitement of the mission, McConnaughy is the central figure in the coming-of-age subplot. Tyler, Executive Officer of the US sub, was denied a command of his own because his captain (played by Bill Paxton) felt that, when push came to shove, he would be unable to order men to die when necessary. When the captain is killed during the mission, Tyler has to take command and overcome his shortcomings to save as many of the crew as he can. Harvey Keitel offers a strong performance as Chief Engineer Klough, a Navy veteran who has doubts about Tyler's ability, and serves as something of a father-figure to him. Keitel's best scene is undoubtedly his confrontation with Tyler after a particularly powerful display of Tyler's self-doubt. ""Don't you ever say `I don't know' again,"" he says. ""The captain always knows - even when he doesn't.""Marvelous performances, great directing by Jonathon Mostow who gives the viewer the feel of being on the sub, and a wonderful original score by Richard Marvin all add up to make this the finest movie I've seen in a long time. Recommended for anyone who wants to have some excitement in their lives.A perfect 10.",U-571
29,richardchatten,"""Clear All Decks!!""",8,30 December 2019,"Despite the fact that plenty of the world's nuclear warheads remain located on submarines, the submarine film now seems a quaintly old-fashioned genre; an impression reinforced by the presense aboard of a now youthful-looking Harvey Keitel (ironically I remember being struck by how young Keitel looked in 'Mean Streets' when I first saw it in 1979).This retread reinforces that feeling by being set in 1942, although it contains plenty of gunplay and vertiginously wobbly 21st Century photography.

This movie isn't historically accurate at all but I am writing this review as a movie, not on whether its truth or lies.This is about how a group of American sailors take over a Nazi U-boat and disguise themselves as Nazis so they can capture the Enigma.The acting is pretty good. I haven't seen much of Matthew McConaughey but I liked him here. Harvey Keitel is a nice asset too. The appearance of Jon Bon Jovi surprised me though.This movie produces tons of action and thrills.

While the crew waits for help from its countrymen, the U.S. covertly approaches it with a mission: board the vessel and obtain the Enigma at all costs. Drafted for this dangerous mission are a group of sailors - not soldiers - led by the redoubtable Lieutenant Andrew Tyler  (Matthew McConaughey, his ample locks shorn). But getting on the boat is only half the task, of course. Soon the Americans are stranded on a foreign sub, with all of the instructions and designations written in German! Luckily for them (!) they were wise enough to include in their number a young sailor who speaks fluent German. What're the odds, really? And while they're trying to translate the German post-haste for a dive, they're suddenly in the sights of a German destroyer! Kind of one of those days when you just wish you had not gotten out of bed.This another popcorn action movie, a white-knuckler that will leave you gripping your chair - our boys are in such peril throughout the movie, and they use up just about every life and chance they have coming to them - that while you know that in the grand Hollywood tradition of the Good Guys winning (and with the knowledge that the Germans did lose the war), you still root and cheer for the sailors to pull through.

Bill Paxton was alright, i liked all of the action scenes, the underwater stuff, the plot line,, the story all of that,, since i'm a sucker for submarine movies, all the intrigue about the Germans was pretty good, but what i think that this film did lack that DAs Boot had was the backstory, and the other scenes that didn't involve the sub ,, like Central Command,, the updates from Headquarters, stuff like that,, but hey other than that i mean this was a terrific movie that really is top of the line, with only a couple of minor flaws.",U-571

Suddenly the entire crew of their submarine have their leaves cancelled and the sub is sent off on a covert mission. A possibility to capture a German encryption machine, called the Enigma, has arisen. A German U-boat has been critically damaged during combat and is immobile at sea. The American sub is disguised as a German U-boat, and the plan is to pose as a relief boat to the damaged u-boat and then board it. However, during the boarding the real relief boat turns up and a sinks the American submarine. A few of the boarding party now find themselves stranded on the damaged German U-boat...Comments: The greatest strength of this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. Cryptic enough? Need an Enigma? Let me try to explain. This is a war/action movie, with some thrills and nice effects. It does that very well. It never tries to send an message or be philosophical or anything. Just plain action. As an audience it is just to sit back and enjoy. The cast is full of competent actors and they don't disappoint. I especially like McConaughey's and Keitel's performances. A good entertaining story with as mentioned good effects to augment. An extra plus for the language difficulties that the movie portrays, i.e. that the Germans do not speak English nor do they make any English manuals to their subs.

I'm sure the WWII generation took a nostalgic look at this film, it was really for all of the brainless mugs who like action movies. Sure, some of the submarine sequences were rather good and the tension was gripping, this film was really pro-war balderdash that didn't even present the facts right (never mind the fact the British were the ones who obtained Germany's Enigma machine).

40,a_chinn,Ripping good old fashioned WWII action/adventure submarine tale,7,17 September 2018,"Exciting and suspenseful WWII adventure tale is more ""Where Eagles Dare"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" than ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Dunkirk."" Those are all great WWI films, but the former are lighter depictions of war and primarily use this period of history as a backdrop for a ripping good adventure tale than any sort of historical insight. In ""U-571,"" a small group of US navy seamen set out on a secret mission to steal an Enigma machine to help crack German U-boat coded messages. To get the machine, they plan to pose as German mechanics and meet up with a Nazi sub in the middle of the Atlantic and to then hijack the sub like it's the opening of Steven Seagal's ""Under Siege."" Their plan succeeds, except that (SPOILER ALERT!) their own sub gets blown up and they find themselves marooned on a German sub with a skeleton crew. To make things worse, mission commander Bill Paxton is killed and young officer Matthew McConaughey now finds himself in charge and struggling with his new leadership position. When this film first came out, it was at the same time I was getting my school administrator license, so I found the film's themes around leadership and qualities of a good leader interesting. I particularly liked Harvey Keitel's lower-ranking Chief Petty Officer and how he coaches McConaughey on how to be a leader, telling him what the men he's leading need and helping him to step up into that role. The cast also includes Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith, and Jake Weber. ""U-571"" was directed and co-written by Jonathan Mostow, an underrated action director who made the excellent Kurt Russell thriller ""Breakdown"" and the under appreciated third Terminator film. All of his film have echos of classic Hollywood adventure and action films in a way that's a welcome contrast to the a majority of the over-directed Hollywood action films nowadays. Mostow's action feels more Robert Aldrich or Walter Hill than say Michael Bay or Paul W.S. Anderson, which is something I wish we had often in action films. I'll take 70s and 80s muscular action films over bombastic 3-D, IMAX, CGI blockbusters that predominate today's multiplexes anytime. Overall, ""U-571"" may not be all that historically accurate or be some magnum opus about men-at-war, but it is a ripping good adventure story. FUN FACT! The allied forces did steal an Enigma in real-life, except it was the British and not the US to led the daring mission.",U-571

For anyone who does not know, The U.S had nothing to do with anything you see, depicted in this movie. It's even titled after the wrong boat. The real U-110 was captured (complete with an Enigma machine) by the British Royal Navy in 1941. Actually U-571, was a legendary German Boat, that sunk over 42,000 tons of Allied shipping. Whilst 'Das Boot' is a strong candidate for the best ever movie, 'U-571' remains a shameful turkey. I think it's the only film in history, to spark a serious debate in the 'House of Commons'.

I wish I could praise more about this movie, but then I would be lying. This movie had potential to be really good. As a fan of undersea war adventures this movie was a major letdown.For a movie to be remarkably good, you can't just depend on action to stand alone, and though this is high on entertainment, the holes in everything else is quite flabbergasting. One of the biggest flaws about ""U-571"" is that it lacks in any kind of historical accuracy as facts are disjointed and the execution was banal. Once again the United States glorifies itself as the heroes of the undersea initiative, but the reality was that it was the British that accomplished the bulk of the task. Why does Hollywood try to fabricate the Americans as the only heroes during the 20th century wars and manipulates its audience by concocting false historical diatribe in order to sell ticket and promote patriotism like they really deserved it?I was really letdown by the acting here. Such a terrific cast of characters like Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel, I expected at least an emotionally charged film. Instead the acting was pure cardboard, they should have hired mannequins instead of performers to star in this movie.For a submarine water movie, emotions and identifying a character is mandatory, by the end of the movie I couldn't tell who's who because of the lack-luster emotions between the performers.The directing put into this movie is absolutely shameful. The crew has no personality at all, it looks like as though they didn't put much heart into this movie. Where's the quality of this movie? The opening scenes are at a snail's pace and then it just drags on skimming over the important scenes which makes the movie very choppy and hard to get adjusted. I suppose the director just wanted a patriotic movie that will make the American audiences have something to be prideful about, which they did, but at the cost of them feeling naive because of the inaccurate story.The visuals are what really saves the movie. The shots of the submarine were excellent and the explosions were quite enjoying to watch. However, it still never saves itself from the mess this movie possesses.If you compare this movie to Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"", it's like comparing prime rib to puppy chow. It's clear that this movie is a sad waste, and had a lot of material to be really good. But with a lot of misery this story develops I can't score high in this review. The action just keeps coming along, but there's no story to tell with no tell with no lessons learn-ed. With poor historical accuracy, bad acting and abysmal direction, this movie should be seen once and then find something else to regain those near two hours you have lost.",U-571
43,philip_vanderveken,They should have asked advice to the director of Das Boot,5,10 September 2004,"Imagine, it's 1941 and a German U-boat is roaming the North Atlantic in search of Allied ships to sink and to make an end to the supply line from the USA to Britain. This would have been a great theme for a movie on itself (remember Das Boot). But apparently the director was afraid it wouldn't be enough, he had to make it a little more spectacular. He wants us to believe that the Americans sent out one of their own submarines to recover an enigma-machine from a German U-boat who broke down in the middle of the ocean and who had to wait for another U-boat to arrive with spare parts... Why they added this? I really don't know, but in my opinion it doesn't do any good to the movie. If you've seen Das Boot and if you are a great fan, like me, you'll probably notice that several of U-571's scenes resemble to the scenes from Das Boot. I'm not saying they copied it, but from time to time I really had a feeling of: Been there, seen that... The same for the acting. It wasn't bad, but wasn't brilliant either. You can see that they watched Das Boot several times before starting to act themselves. This means that you sometimes will have the feeling that you already know the characters, that you've met them before... I would say the actors did a good job, without excelling. They helped me to forget about the bad story ... from time to time.All in all U-571 isn't a good movie. You'll find it well worth seeing when you haven't seen Das Boot before and when you don't know anything about World War II. They should have asked advice to the director of Das Boot. He certainly knew how to give you the feeling that you were into that boat, being attacked by the enemy, alone with the crew and no-one to come to the rescue. I really missed that in U-571.

44,screenman,Best Worst Submarine Movie.,5,17 January 2008,"With all of the new advances in sound and visual technology, there was ample scope for a truly authentic, modern American re-make of the classic 'submarine movie' of the 1950's and 60's. And heaven knows, it doesn't require much study to realise that Yank submariners played a huge part in the war. The Pacific war, that is - not the Atlantic. There were some tremendous daring-do escapades with memorable victories. In fact, I understand that the American fleet was the most successful submarine fleet of the war, with also fewer casualties per unit vessel. They accounted for over half of all Japanese maritime losses.Movie-makers don't need to invent heroes and scenarios then; they are already spoilt for choice. So why this? Why a completely fictitious movie not only about an event that didn't happen, but a travesty of true naval history? I believe it is generally agreed that the 'enigma' capture was a British success. The Yanks weren't even there. Moreover when Britain began supplying the USA with intelligence intercepts garnered from its application, they were ignored by their naval high-command, with appalling consequences to coastal shipping. But then, Hollywood's air-brushing out of American mistakes and British successes is almost as inevitable as the type-casting of Germans as dumb, robotic bigots. It's not something to take personally. Though after all this time it does get a bit tiresome.Audio-visually at least the movie was right on the money, especially if you have a decent home cinema. Bangs and clangs come over solid and visceral. There was clever, though rather obvious use of CGI. Little issues of personal tension didn't harm the rather shallow Alistair Mclean style plot and gave a little substance to its equally shallow characters. Unfortunately, all the old clichés were stowed aboard too: conflict between skipper and first officer ('Run Silent Run Deep', 'Up Periscope', 'Crimson Tide'), cat-and-mouse conflict with a destroyer ('The Enemy Below', 'Das Boot'), diving below the vessel's test-depth (Yawn - 'Das Boot', 'The Enemy Below', 'Ice Station Zebra', 'Crimson Tide') and so on.And there simply isn't enough space to enumerate all of the tactical-technical errors that could have been avoided with just a little research.Like so many Hollywood offerings today, - 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbour', 'Gladiator' - a wonderful opportunity was abandoned in favour of crass spectacle. Instead, we got a movie that shamefully ignored all of the American submariners' sterling accomplishments - true episodes at least as remarkable as those depicted here - in favour of well-engineered, implausible, and frankly misleading pap.Don't worry about snubbing us Brits. We're thick-skinned and used to it. But if I were a Yank instead, I would regard this movie as an act of treason, so shamefully does it disavow their true nautical heroes.It's a pity the director didn't just update 'Torpedo Run'.",U-571
45,inspectors71,U-Gotta Problem?,7,4 May 2016,"Sure, it's inaccurate. Yup, it's a British story grafted onto the US Navy. Gotcha, Jon Bon Jovi can't act. Yes, black sailors were second-class citizens.We get it. So shut your trap!And enjoy Jonathan Mostow's U-571, a fanciful story of the USN trying to steal an ""Enigma"" machine from the Nazis so that the Allies could read the Krauts' mail. It's all very derring-do and gung-ho and ""You're an officer; you always have the answer!"" leadership tutorial. And I loved just about every minute of it.I like daring, gung-ho, and dammit, when you're confronted with a problem you don't know how to solve and the boys are dependin' on you, you punt!U-571 is a movie that would fit nicely into WWII because the Yanks are plucky and tough, and the Germans are rotten to the core. When it's over and the credits are done, you almost expect a graphic that tells the audience to buy War Bonds in the lobby of the theatre.",U-571
46,PatrynXX,"Not bad, on the edge of your seat until the end of the movie.",7,23 October 2000,"Might have spoilers:I had this movie sitting around a 9 star until I hit the end of the movie. The ending was a bit of a letdown.  So I gave it a 7.  But it's a very good movie action wise.  Some people like to compare this to Das Boot.  There is no comparison really.  The two movies have different directions and I don't wanna compare the two.  While Das Boot is going after ethics, U-571 is going after an encoder.  However there are times in this movie where (like Hunt for red october)that I doubt this scenes for the sub were shot under water. Scenes when the explosions go off that the boat shooked faster than it would for a boat of that size.  But the insides were beautifully shot.  I woulda loved to see this in a theater.",U-571
47,Karl Self,Shipwreck,1,20 October 2007,"I rented U-571 thinking that a movie with submarines and Harvey Keitel in it would at least be vaguely entertaining, but boy, was I wrong. As for its mindless entertainment value, if you have only ever seen one u - boat movie you will essentially have seen U-571 because it goes to great pains not to miss any cliché in the book; the first third in particular is an almost exact copy of ""Das Boot"".What really angers me about U-571 though, apart from it being a really bad movie, is the premeditated way it tries to remanufacture history. Without going into details: the actual Enigma machine was relatively well known, the difficult bit was cracking the code -- which was brilliantly accomplished by the British (after some spadework from the Poles). Next there is the cheap attempt to whitewash racial segregation in the US by throwing in a black sailor and then putting the onus on the Germans by showing a German sailor being shocked at seeing a black person -- maybe it was the historical inaccuracy he was astounded by. Even worse, the film promotes an almost fascist type of ideology, namely the leader principle, mindless submission to authority, the objective must be achieved regardless of the cost of human life (enemy or comrade). So ironically, U-571, with reversed sides and minus the special effects, could pass for a German propaganda movie of that era.",U-571
48,phubbs,u-571,8,18 November 2014,"Well this caused a hullabaloo upon release, such a big hullabaloo that it even involved our British Prime Minister, some MP's and eventually President Clinton! I do recall at the time that Britain was not too pleased about the historical rigging so Clinton had to smooth things over, was quite the headline.Anyway if you can see past the huge numerous historical inaccuracies this wartime submarine thriller is pure adventure and action in a real boys own way. I don't mean to take anything away from the real memory of the maritime war effort but this really is a rollicking good fun film that will grab you and not let go.A gripping plot surrounding the need to capture the Enigma cipher machine of the German U-boat U-571. The crew of the US S-33 are sent in disguised as a German U-boat to infiltrate U-571 and capture the machine without anyone ever knowing they were there. Of course things don't go to plan and this is where the thrills begin as the US crew fight to remain undetected and escape with their valuable cargo.At first the film isn't overly impressive visually, seems to cozy, but as the story progresses things seem to get better, probably due to the moisture, sweat, heat and dirt buildup on crew and set. External visuals are lovely as we get many excellent pan shots of a real sub ocean bound with people on board (not sure whether they are the actual actors). Like other sub flicks ('Crimson Tide') most of the film takes place inside the German U-boat. Not as stunning or large as interior shots in said Scott flick but naturally size/tech varies between subs of then and now. What you do get is a very tight cramped experience which really offers an insight into how these boys lived in these tin cans. Realism is assured and is enough to give anyone a fear of confined spaces, the constant dripping from pipes and seals would do it for me.Cast is quite a unique mixed bag here too. 80's action men Paxton and Keith are reunited after 'The Lords of Discipline', Keith looking the slick Bond type in his turtle neck and leather coat, a bit clichéd maybe.Other main leads went to hard man Keitel alongside wannabe action hero/romcom regular McConaughey. British actor Weber struggled to maintain his US accent which unintentionally gave me some chuckles. Of course one noteworthy element was the inclusion of Jon Bon Jovi in the cast, I think his first major role in a proper major flick. At the time most did ask why they couldn't have found a real actor for the role, his presence certainly made you wonder about the films credibility before release, a rock star in a legitimate war film?So with a mixed bag of various actors from various genres the film still managed to be one of the best war thrillers I've seen in a long while. Like I said the sub interior sequences are perfect and capture the hellish mood whilst the few special effects are nicely done and not over the top. Musical score doesn't quite hit the emotions as well as other war films, not overly memorable. Despite the Americanisation of the truth this film still wins and delivers a ripping yarn alongside a good dedication to the real men of the time. Love the films poster also. 8/10",U-571
49,CharltonBoy,Entertaining but historicaly inacurate.,7,28 January 2001,"U-571 is a very entertaining film and most people could not fail to be entertained by this. It is the Story of a group US navy who are sent on a mission to retreve the German Enigma Coding machine which is crucial to the outcome of the second world war. Mathew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi star in this fascinating war movie. The DVD has some superb sound and visual affects so crank up the surround sound. The biggest problem i have with the film is that quite a major historical change is made to the story. Instead of the navy being the British Royal Navy , which actualy stole the enigma machine , all the heroes in this film just happen to be from the US navy which is strange because they never stole one of the coding machines until 2 years later , in which time the British had already stolen 2!!!!. Never mind, thats Hollywood i suppose. 7 out of 10.",U-571
50,gbheron,Standard (War)fare,6,9 March 2003,"There's nothing new on offer in ""U-571"", the story about Allied attempts to capture German U-boats and their prized Enigma code machines. When a U-boat is crippled in the North Atlantic, an operation is quickly mounted in which an American sub is camouflaged as German to get close enough to send aboard a rescue crew which will then overpower the Nazis. No problema. 
There is also the personal conflict where the second in command (McConnaughey) has just been denied promotion by the commander (Paxton). Most of the other characters are not very well developed (stereotyped) like the standard war movies of past decades. And the action sequences are predictable. ""U-571"" was nominated for lots of sound-related awards, but this is lost on standard television systems like mine. If this is the way you intend to view ""U-571"", don't.

53,spookyrat1,Fires All Tubes!,7,27 May 2019,"Forget the history aspect and just accept that this is a completely fictitious story, which it is. In this way you are far more likely to enjoy the very entertaining and suspenseful U-571. Factual accuracy is not a strong point of this film. What is a strong point however is the clever and unorthodox employment of typical submarine film genre tropes, to create a tense, absorbing war drama, with plenty of action and unexpected twists.The U - 571 is a World War II German submarine boarded by American submariners to capture her Enigma cipher machine. In an extended prologue we see her and her crew attacking an Allied convoy in the Atlantic Ocean, but sustaining badly damaged engines in escaping. A distress call for assistance from the German Navy is intercepted by American naval intelligence, who hatch a plan to use the crew of American sub S-33 to try to steal the Enigma machine coding device and sink the U-571 through subterfuge, before German assistance arrives on the scene.Matthew McConaughey is Lieutenant Andrew Tyler the ambitious, but socially popular XO of the S-33, skippered by the ever reliably stoic Bill Paxton playing Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren. But the talented cast list, like the submarines, is long and deep. There is plenty of well choreographed and photographed action both above and below the ocean surface and in and out of various submarines. Challengers to survival for the S-33 crew arrive from depth charge, cannon and other torpedo attacks, as well as those caused by onboard fires and explosions, the machinations of untrustworthy prisoners and even a possible mutiny amongst various sailors.While there have been better war films over the years, U-571 is a well-paced, stirring and at times exhilarating adventure that never lets up from start to cessation of action.

54,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Tense and enjoyable,8,10 December 2007,"Here's something interesting: a travesty of history in order to pave the way for breakneck action sequences. America! F*** Yeah!Many people with any sort of knowledge about the actual Allied apprehension of the Enigma machine and ensuing code breaking probably laughed out loud at this movie. It does in fact deviate from history. No wait, I take that back, it creates its own history. Then in doing so it puts the Americans at the forefront when it was really the Polish who acquired and first deciphered the Enigma and then it was reconstructed by the British. Sure, the history is wrong, but the action/suspense is first rate and the characters are actually likable. Take ""Pearl Harbor"" which also has gross inaccuracies in history, but then it doesn't provide anything else to make up for it. It just shows a clichéd love triangle and lots of explosions. ""U-571"" has great action scenes and a genuine sense of danger that all audiences want for their heroes of figure out a way out of. Predictably they, do, but that's part of the fun of these movies.Also, it should be noted that while ""U-571"" makes use of many war and action movie clichés it doesn't do it so shamelessly. In fact, it's one of those movies that takes familiar elements and rearranges them into its own rhyme and rhythm. The resulting story has about as much structural integrity as the submarine that carries our heroes - it takes you on a tense ride, but that's it. And what more could you really ask for from an action movie? In fact many movies are much better when viewed as action movies. What is probably my favorite movie of all time, ""Where Eagles Dare,"" is not a war movie. The book was mildly believable, but the movie not at all. But that's why they call it ""escapist realism"" so you can escape from the reality and enjoy a reworked set of rules. When used right, these new rules, hopefully, provide good entertainment. And in ""U-571"" they do so and they do it very well. --- 8/10Rated PG-13 for action/violence. Ages 7+",U-571

Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton lead the cast as the officers aboard the American sub. *SPOILERS* There are no women in this movie except for in the beginning sequence. Which is a good thing. If there was, you wonder how their part would have fit in with the rest of the cast. This movie is intense and gripping. It really makes gives off good suspense. The only thing that I found bad was that Bill Paxton's character is killed off within the first half of the movie and he is listed as the film's second leading star!

I thought the best performances came from Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, Harvey Keitel and Matthew McConaughy. The basic story has been covered by others, so I'll not bother with it here. There is enough drama and action to keep anyone interested (well, people who like that sort of thing anyway). It's a story of survival, of courage, respect and teamwork.

58,kuarinofu,Semi-war-themed action blockbuster,6,11 August 2020,"U-571 is an action film with quite a budget for the time. It is not a history war action film, although, in the end, they do a fast scroll of historical facts for some reason.The film is not very accurate with its facts, and I'm not talking about the specifics of submarines or naval battles, uniforms, or something like this but rather general believability. Some of the things we see feel very unrealistic and more Hollywood-like.The film has an all-star cast, but there are no good characters for the actors to work with. Most of them are very generic, while some are downright ignorant and unresponsible. They build up a lot of general patriotic stereotypes, but these just don't contribute to a good film in my opinion.This film was clearly inspired by THE BEST submarine film ever made - Das Boot, it has some of the similar scenes, music choices, and more. What it doesn't have though are believable characters. We have just plain basic good guys and the bad guys. One side is pure evil, the other is just good in every aspect. I thought that they would do something interesting with the German captain, but they never did, he's just evil. I thought there will be some internal drama written for Matthew McConaughey, but there really isn't. His character just spills out very basic cliche inspirational speeches and that's it. Nobody on the boat acts like a real human being.While it had some good tense action scenes... there's nothing in the film besides that.

59,bopdog,DVD edition improves over the theatrical release,5,11 February 2002,"Just as we'd expect from the better DVD commentaries and documentaries that accompany movies, this one adds dimensions additional to the flick itself, and add to our enjoyment of the flick. At the time, I was irritated at the theatrical release of ""U-571."" The special effects are kind of lame-- wooden and fake. The the ""all-too-human"" hesitations of the supposed ""excellent"" executive officer would never happen in real military life. The guy simply would NEVER have made it that far or lasted that long with that kind of psycho-drama going on. And the insubordination displayed by some of the crew would also never have been tolerated in a real military situation. The mouthy, smart-assed crewman Mazola, for example, would have been shot on the spot in a real combat situation. Really.But then you watch the making-of segments, and you hear the film school dude-- Mostlow, I think, talk about the kind of movie he wanted to make: An actual replication of a 1940s era WW II movie. And elderly Dino DeLarentus talking in the same vein-- and then you get it. And the effects guys and the set designers and the costume lady show off the research they did, and you appreciate ""U-571"" even more.OK-- it's a little cheesy, a little corn-ball. But knowing what the producers and director set out to do, it's also spot-on entertainment!One point that should be addressed: Some British viewers wrote early on that the movie was ""bad"" because it insinuates that the Americans first captured Enigma, rather than the British. The points should be made: 1) No American student of history would ever deny the British the hallmark of being the first to capture the Enigma device (although the British actually had their first machine delivered to them by a Finnish businessman; it wasn't captured). Everybody over here knows that the British combined bravery and genius to round up a few of these priceless gizmos, and contrive Bletchley Park's amazing and heroic team of code breakers and communications analysts on a scale almost equalling America's Manhattan Project. Yaay Britain. It is also true that even with the machines, there was much more work to do. Consider that by mid 1942, the movie's time frame, the allies (due, of course, to the British) had the Enigma machine for close to 2 years, and we still had NO idea what the German U-Boat service was saying to itself. And, the Americans had been able to crack the tough Japanese 'blue' Naval Code that same year, in time to defeat the Japanese at Midway, without an Enigma machine. And with continuing mechanical and cryptographical improvements and alterations introduced by the Axis Powers throughout the war--- code breaking and daring military raids throughout the war were on-going affairs.The movie does not claim America was the first. In fact it dedicates the film to the British submarines who actual were. But American submariners did mount such attempts-- one which actually succeeding in 1944. AND, this is just a MOVIE! An American movie, for American audiences, with enough truth to have integrity, and enough glam and flash and theater to entertain the intended audience.",U-571
60,bigverybadtom,"An Action Flick, Not A Historical One",4,20 September 2020,"This story is purely fictional; people may complain that Hollywood gets history wrong, but that is like saying that professional wrestling is not a real sport. Most movies are made for entertainment and not education; Dances With Wolves and Disney's Pocahontas give completely false depictions of both American Indians and white men; Lawrence Of Arabia and The Bridge Over The River Kwai give equally false depictions of they people they depict, and they were not even American made. Many of Shakespeare's plays are quite revisionist in their depictions of history as well, partly for drama and partly to avoid stepping on the toes of the royals.With that out of the way, what is the actual movie? A German submarine has been attacked by the British Navy but only disabled and not destroyed, and the crew radios for help. The Americans hear of this and send out an old submarine disguised as a fellow Nazi sub, with the idea of capturing the Enigma code machine from the ship. The Americans reach and invade the submarine and capture the crew, only for the real German submarine to arrive and destroy the American sub, leaving only a few stray Americans aboard the German one-and believe it or not, this is only the beginning.Good if you want action-adventure; no good to learn about history.

61,Movie-12,"Everything is external, but there is a lot of action and tension. **1/2 out of ****.",6,11 May 2000,"U-571 / (2000) **1/2 	""U-571"" begins with heroic rescues and by the end, lives will be sacrificed, damage will be costly, and everything concludes in a nice sequence as the film's survivors are rescued in the presence of a beautiful sunset. Any movie with a formulaic opening and conclusion like the above lacks thought and originality; this film takes place deep within the sea, but everything else about it is surface shallow. ""U-571"" contains many enormous explosions, artistic set designs, tense moments of sheer silence, boisterous battle sequences, non-glorifying shutouts, and memorable camera techniques. Director Jonathan Mostow establishes the film's action to create focused and exhilarative excitement, but he is unable to form depth and intensity within the characters. Their dialogue is not profound or meaningful like the material in ""The Hunt for Red October"" or ""Crimson Tide."" There are few internal conflicts to develop personalities or heart; everything is external. Only a handful of scenes in the entire movie have much of an impact at all. But like ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide,"" this production has an enormously believable submarine atmosphere. I liked the movie's appearance and its tension filled moments in deep, dark aquatic zones. Even then, however, there are nothing memorable. The characters lack emotional development as well. There is Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), who feels he is ready to command a submarine, and Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), who believes Tyler is courageous and determined, but is not willing to sacrifice others in the line of duty. American U-boat crew supporting roles go to Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, Jake Weber, Jack Noseworthy, David Keith, and Terrence ""T.C."" Carson. These characters, living in the early 1940s, are summoned to capture the German Enigma Code, which allows the foreigners to communicate their U-boats without alerting the Allies. The German submarines in the North Atlantic are causing trouble. Thus the US Navy team hijacks their ship and kills all enemies on board, only to have their own sub blown sky high by another German battleship. Although this proposition develops the German circumstances, American motives, and briefly introduces each character, the movie takes a lengthy amount of time to set all this up. In its effective ways, the audience becomes concerned for the Americans, and the action scenes are involving, but the story simply has no where to go after achieving its premise. After the Navy crew members become stranded aboard the enemy submarine, the movie represents situation after situation involving noisy combat and shouting characters. Such characters are well acted, especially Matthew McConaughey's. This fine young actor captures Tyler with a clear perspective challenging the audience and creating interest with other characters. Harvey Keitel also performs with dramatically correct intensity. Jack Noseworthy (""Even Horizon,"" ""Breakdown"") and the rest of the supporting cast offer strong secondary performances, although most of these characters are simple minded and one-dimensional. However, even some of Hollywood's most famous names cannot recover a frivolous script by Jonathan Mostow. Mostow is a talented filmmaker; his last production was ""Breakdown,"" the tantalizing thriller starring Kurt Russell and a broken down car. Maybe this filmmaker is better off with his feet on the ground rather than in the water.",U-571
62,FlickJunkie-2,Rises above its flaws to deliver non-stop action,7,19 October 2000,"A writer/director can take only so much artistic license before a story that is supposedly truth-based turns into a sham.  Jonathan Mostow runs dangerously close to that line.  The list of inaccuracies and improbabilities in this film is lengthy.  As has been noted numerous times, the British and not the Americans cracked the enigma code.  There were no blacks serving with whites on submarines, due to the segregation policy of the U.S. military before 1946.  The Germans were not evil, cold-blooded killers who strafed unarmed survivors.  The likelihood of a single torpedo hitting a ship showing only a bow profile is astronomically low, etc., etc., etc..  If you put aside the fact that this was pure fantasy rather than fact-based fiction, this film was great entertainment.  The story was engrossing, the action was non-stop and the suspense was extremely well done.  Mostow uses every submarine film device ever invented and gives the crew a continual flow of crises to solve.  Yes, it smacked of U.S. nationalism to a fault and the music was so insipidly patriotic it became corny.  However, though this was a shamelessly derivative work, it was intense and twisty with great special effects, and that made it worth watching.Many people have compared this film with `Das Boot', concluding that this film pales by comparison to that classic.  `Das Boot' is one of my all time favorite films, but I really don't think you can compare the two.  They were really telling completely different types of stories.  `Das Boot' was a highly realistic character study and `U-571' was a fantasy action/adventure flick.  The only thing that they had in common was the fact that they each took place inside a German submarine.  The acting was nothing special, but in defense of the cast, the film wasn't really about the characters so they didn't have much to do except look tense.  The best performance was delivered by Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough, the old sea dog who held the crew together.  Matthew McConaughey was hollow and wooden.  This was not one of his better performances.Despite a long list of grievances, this film still delivers high power entertainment and rises above its many flaws.  I rated it a 7/10.  Be prepared to suspend a ton of disbelief and then enjoy the ride.",U-571

64,moviesleuth2,Relentless action and suspense,8,10 June 2009,"Lovers of ""Das Boot,"" get in line and see ""U-571."" Submarine warfare has returned to the big screen, and it's a non-stop thriller! While not a true story, it's still a lot of fun. And besides, who goes to a summer action movie to actually learn something?The set-up is genius. A U.S. Navy Submarine led by Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) is given a crucial assignment. Steal a code machine from a crippled U-boat (German submarine). Everything goes according to plan, except the U.S. sub is destroyed by a nearby German vessel, and the boarding party, led by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) is left to command the broken sub.This is an action movie, and it doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. In a movie like this, all that matters is action, action, and more action. Suspense is desired, but a movie can succeed without it. Fortunately, ""U-571"" has both, and in great amounts. The story starts out slowly to help us get to know the characters, but once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Ever.""U-571"" is populated by a number of good performances. In general, I don't like Matthew McConaughey. In the right role, he can be effective, but usually he just mails in performances in formulaic romantic comedies. But ""U-571"" calls for him to carry the movie on his own, and he delivers. Andrew Tyler is a man who thinks he knows what to do, but it turns out he has a lot of learning to do. He can alternately be like a father figure and a tough-as-nails, do-what-I-say-or-else commander. McConaughey hits every note. He's aided by his CPO Henry Klough, ably played by Harvey Keitel. Klough is a man who does his job no matter what, and expects everyone to do the same. He's the veteran among the crew, but he knows his place, and he stays there. Jake Weber is suitably mysterious as the man who knows everything about the code machine, but doesn't talk about it unless he has to. This is a guy who spends his time behind a desk instead of out in the field, so being in an situation is not something he's used to (then again, nor is to for anyone else, but they're submarine sailors, and he isn't). Rounding out the young (though severely underdeveloped) cast are David Keith, Jon Bon Jovi, Tom Guiry, Will Estes, Jack Noseworthy, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson, Erik Palladino and Dave Power. All are likable and perform ably. Thomas Kretschmann is the German hostage, but again, he's not that developed.One of the reasons that ""U-571"" works as well as it does is that director Jonathan Mostow is able to create a claustrophobic atmosphere. Any personality deficiencies are not as problematic because we feel right like we're there with the crew. But Mostow's skill doesn't end there. He keeps things moving, and the audience never has a break from the tension. Just as one situation closes, another one is right around the corner. In retrospect, this decreases credibility, but for the constraints of a two-hour movie, it doesn't matter. Besides, you won't be thinking about it while you're watching it.Comparisons to the classic WWII submarine movie ""Das Boot"" are unavoidable. In terms of quality, Wolfgang Peterson's classic is better, but for those who don't have the time (or can't stand subtitles), ""U-571"" does the trick.

What a fabulous film! The director, Jonathan Mastow, is a wonderfully gifted film maker and his script shows magnificently the heroism of the Americans who so selflessly captured the Nazi Enigma machines. In essence, by their brave acts they won the war against the Germans and destroyed the Master Race single handedly. Tremendous special effects and beautiful performances from an all star cast are highlights of this wonderful film but it is the dramatic, tension filled story of the exciting adventures Americans in the North Atlantic that will overwhelm audiences with its power. Certainly in the top ten productions depicting any aspect of the Second World War ever filmed. It is deeply satisfying how recent years have seen this and motion pictures such as Pearl Harbor and Inglorious Basterds pay tribute to true American heroes.",U-571

No more, no less.",7,15 February 2008,"U-571 was been depicted as a pro-American movie in which it wants to show that Americans are capable of doing everything, except finding a director who can find a history book and read it. In reality, America had nothing to do with finding the Enigma Coding Machine, but the British were the ones responsible for taking it away from the Germans.Besides the fact that this is nothing but a B.S. movie, I'd found it to be quite enjoyable without losing interest. I thought of U-571 as just another made up thriller to keep audience riveted from the first second we see the Universal Logo up on screen to seeing Matthew McConaughey and other actors like Harvey Keitel and Bill Paxton in action. It's really ""The Hunt for Red October"" without the interest of knowing about submarines or history such as ""Das Boot"" but instead having a good time.If you own this film on DVD, crank up the volume and enjoy.",U-571
68,jhaggardjr,Entertaining submarine thriller,8,24 November 2000,"""U-571"" is an entertaining submarine thriller that takes place during World War II when an American submarine crew make an attempt to take over a German U-boat and recover a secret-code transmitter. Things don't exactly go as planned. ""U-571"" has a good opening, then drags for about a half-an-hour before the real excitement begins. Matthew McConaughey gives a strong, effective performance as the leader of the American crew, and gets good support by the supporting cast. The action scenes are well done, and all-in-all I wasn't disappointed. ""U-571"" kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time, which makes it a pretty good film. However, it's not quite as good as another submarine thriller, 1990's ""The Hunt for Red October"".

69,SKG-2,"Nothing new, but still good",8,25 April 2000,"Three years ago, Jonathan Mostow made a neat little thriller called BREAKDOWN, and while there was nothing in it we hadn't seen before, it was still good.  Now he turns the same trick with this movie.  True, it's not a classic like DAS BOOT was, but if we said that about every movie(""well, it's no...""), we'd have no movies.  I was caught up with most of it, and I enjoyed it.  Also, I liked Matthew McConaughey, who proved once again he's a better actor than given credit for, even when he's not using his trademark grin and charm.  Except for Harvey Keitel and Jack Noseworthy(who was also in BREAKDOWN), the rest of the cast wasn't distinctive, but they were good.Now to answer some of the criticism of this movie I've read: (1) It's not just that this is a fictional story and not fact, it's that the Enigma is a McGuffin; just something to get the plot rolling.  The real story is the crew trying to survive on the enemy submarine and McConaughey's character learning if he has what it takes to be a captain.  If we found out the characters were also supposed to be able to use the Enigma as well, that would have been a problem, but all they're doing is taking it. (2) If I remember correctly, and it could be I'm not, the German captain who orders his gunman to shoot the survivors on lifeboats says those are his orders from ""the Fuehrer.""  Of course, that's no excuse(given that following orders was the defense for My Lai), but we weren't meant to think, ""Oh, these German bad guys"" because of this scene, especially since they didn't look particularly happy about it.On the other hand, I do agree one torpedo blowing up a destroyer was a little ludicrous.  But it does seem to me a lot of comments which nit-pick films like this are by people who go in not caring if the movie works as a whole, but who have to be satisfied about every little detail in the movie, and go through it as if they were studying something under a microscope. People like that, in my humble opinion, need to get a life.",U-571
70,chrisbrown6453,"Lots of good action, good acting, made you feel like you were really inside a submarine.",8,19 June 2002,"I must say I rather enjoyed U-571. I'm not so sure about the story. Not that I don't believe it was based on reality, just that there really wasn't a strong plot. It was basically a testosterone flick that went from action scene to action scene with a thread of plot to help it along. I think if there had been a little more investment in the characters and the dialogue, this would have been a great movie. As it is, it's just a really good movie.
Matthew McConaughey plays Lt. Andrew Tyler. Apparently he was supposed to be commander of his own sub, but because of a lack of recommendation from his superior officer Captain Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), he will not get his own sub. It's at this point that you can tell that dialogue was not taken into consideration a lot in this script. We get the old ""you need to have the heart to do something you don't want to do"" speech that I've heard before. This means of course that this exact thing will come into play later on in the film, and something bad is going to happen to someone we're supposed to care about. Anyway, they get informed that they are going on a secret mission. A Nazi U-boat is stranded at sea, and the Americans are supposed to head out to the sub before the Germans get there, and steal an important German encoding machine known as the ""Enigma"". With this machine the Allies will be able to intercept and understand German secret messages. However, at the end of the movie you find out something that had you known it before seeing the movie, may have slightly changed your opinion of what they were doing, and how important it really was. Anyway, it's not giving away too much to say that when they arrive at the U-boat, things go very wrong. The Americans end up on the U-boat, and need to find a way to save themselves before the Germans find out what happened. Along with McConaughey and Paxton, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi also star in this film. I generally am not a big fan of Harvey Keitel, but I didn't hate him in this movie. Most people probably won't even recognize Bon Jovi in the movie, but he did a good job. Overall the acting was very good in this movie. Now I have never seen the highly acclaimed film Das Boot but I understand that it's the benchmark for claustrophobic submarine films. I can say that U-571 accomplished the same goal. I felt like I was trapped inside that sub right along with the actors. It makes for a very disturbing and scary feeling while you're watching. Every time there was an explosion, I swear I could feel it in my seat (which may be more of the sound in the theater than anything else). The director, Jonathan Mostow, did a very good job of making you feel like you were part of the action. The camera movements were very first person NYPD Blue-ish with a lot of shaking cameras and close up of the sweat on the faces of the actors. I thought that some of the scenes were very tense which was exactly how you were supposed to feel.
So I guess the biggest problem I had was with the plot. Yes I realize that getting the ""Enigma"" was important, but that occurred early on, and it then became a fight for survival. But I got lost trying to figure out where exactly there were, and how much danger they were actually in. At one point they say they're headed straight for Nazi waters, and then all of a sudden the movie ends. And early on they say they can't destroy the Nazi ship that's headed towards them, and then all of a sudden they think they can. Weapons seemed to come from nowhere on the ship. I felt there were a few too many holes in the story to make this a truly great film.
Overall I thought for what it was, a guy film, it was really good. If you like war movies, if you like guy films with a lot of action, a lot of sweat, a lot of yelling, and a lot of explosions, I think you'll like U-571.",U-571
71,bat-5,A great submarine adventure,7,25 April 2000,"U-571 gives us the chance to feel what it was like to serve on a submarine during WWII.  Playing a very dangerous game of cat and mouse, subs would sneak up on an unsuspecting ship and torpedo them out of the water.  But, the subs would have to be careful not to be detected, because any surviving ship would find them, and sink them.  U-571 sets up the plot very quickly, a Nazi U-boat is disabled, and an American sub has a chance to capture the Enigma device.  With the Enigma device in hand, the Allied forces would be able to break the U-boat's codes.   However, things don't go well for the American sailors who commandeer U-571.  They have to evade the Germans in order to make it back to safe waters, and the submarine is not in the best shape. The cast works well, and you can see the tension in their faces when depth charges start rocking the ship.  The film works well on several other levels, especially when there is no sound.  The lack of noise brings out the most tension during the film.  You wait in anticipation for a charge to go off, and you never know when one might.  Be sure to see the film in a theater that has digital sound.  This way, you'll hear every pop, ping, creak and the whine of a torpedo the way you might hear it on a submarine.",U-571
72,moviemanMA,Direct Hit!,8,18 July 2005,"World War II movies have pretty much become its own genre of film. With everything from beach landings, air battles, and naval skirmishes. Now we get a great look beneath the waves on board a submarine to see what happens when a top secret operation goes horribly wrong.U-571 is the true story of a crew of sailors who are assigned a secret mission: to find and obtain the secret German coding machine known only as the enigma. Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) leads his crew with the executive officer Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) and CPO Henry Klough (Harvey Kitel). Along for the ride are Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) and Maj. Matthew Coonan (David Keith) of the USMC. Along with the crew, they venture out into the Atlantic, disguised as a German U-boat (subamarine). When they surprise a vessel carrying the enigma, there celebration is short lived, those who stayed behind on the boat are blown away by a another German U-boat. Those that were on the boarding party are forced to go into the actual German U-boat they were attacking and use it against the aggressor. With the exception of one German prisoner, they are on there own now and must find a way to get back home or to an ally port. The only problem is they are in enemy infested waters.What this group must do is follow their new commander in Lt. Tyler and try and stay alive through depth charge attacks and other German encounters. Luckily some of the crew speak German so they get by. Through the madness that was World War II, this boat will become a part of history with the recovery of the enigma machine. If the German don't know that they have it, the US and other allies can intercept other German U-boat's signals and search and destroy. If the German's suspect something, they might change the code and make the operation entirely useless. Lt. Tyler has some big decisions coming up ahead.The growth of the crew is tremendous and shows a real change in the relationship between officers and their fellow sailors. When these men are faced with a daunting task, they must come together to solve it. McConaughey is marvelous as the Lt. thrown into the captains role. With his student/teacher relationship with Kitel, he learns how to think and lead and to have an solution for every problem that arises.The movie really does a good job of illustrating the strength of a crew in war fare. Submarine movies are dicey to make. It's a confined space and it can sometimes get repetitive. With a new problem arising every other minute, U-571 will keep you on the edge of your seat. It almost makes you feel like you're in the boat with them. U-571 will cruise right into your movie collection.",U-571

Many problems throughout this film.Harvey Keitel is too old for sub duty.  In U-571, Matthew McConaughey is transformed to a ""Little Wesley"" Crusher protagonist effortlessly pulling out seemingly complex genious-level plans at moments notice.

It's fairly predictable and the somewhat overlong ""Splashes!"" scenes feel extremely second-hand. The claustrophobic environment of WW2 subs is very well captured.

77,Miles-10,Excellent if formulaic war movie,7,21 May 2000,"Writer/director Jonathan Mostow knows the formula for an exciting story and that is good for everyone looking for an entertaining adventure yarn. I can only recall one discontinuity. Matthew McConnaughy's character punches Erik Palladino, and in the next shot Palladino doesn't look as if he's been punched at all. But such glitches are rare. Another criticism: While it is refreshing that Mostow wants to convey that his characters are scared even when they do brave deeds, the director has McConnaughy spend more than half his screen time with his eyes wi-i-ide open. But I quibble. This story is fun for many of the same reasons that ""Star Wars"" (1977) is fun although ""U-571"" is much darker. You have the hero, Lt. Tyler, who wants to be a skipper, but he isn't ready because he doesn't know how to make risky decisions. (Trust in the force, Luke.) The hero has two mentors and one dies off early just as Obi Wan Kenobi died off surprisingly early. Nice touch, giving him two mentors, because then we don't have to believe the hero learns his lessons from the dead mentor only. Realistically, he needs more than one lesson, as anyone does. Whereas a fantasy like ""Star Wars"" can have Obi Wan come back as a ghost, a gritty combat film must have a living mentor to be credible. The hero's initiation into the adventure is made more tense when he is kept in the dark about the mission until the crew is out to sea. Adding a sinister element of mystery is Jack Weber as Lt. Hirsh, a secret operative who is forced on the crew whether they like it or not. (Is he from signal intelligence, a precursor of the NSA?) Hirsh along with David Keith's Marine intelligence officer, immediately suggest that there are secret forces at work--even among the crew. In an eerie, disorienting scene, Hirsh exposes the fact that the radio operator (Jack Noseworthy) speaks fluent German, something he has kept hidden from crewmembers for fear of being identified with the enemy. In other ways, the language difference between the Americans and their enemy is exploited for tension: What if your life suddenly were to depend on operating a vessel on which all the controls are labeled in a foreign language, and you have only two men capable of running around the ship, translating for your crew? The hero in ""U-571"" faces one edge-of-your-seat challenge after another as he learns to command ""on the job."" The tough situations become tougher and tougher until the climatic scene in which the hero not only gets to blow up something big (not quite the Death Star, but then Darth Vader isn't aboard, either), but he learns the final grim lesson of command in the process. The equally grim moral question that is implicit here goes unquestioned by film-maker Mostow, but then the hero's lesson is precisely that he does not have the right to hesitate about life-and-death decisions. Unless you avoid war movies like the plague, you won't want to miss this exciting film. By the way: Yes, the movie is fiction. The British, not the Americans, caught the first German Enigma machine on a U-boat. And they didn't have as difficult a time bringing this war-winning elixir back to their ""tribe"" as do the crew in ""U-571."" According to the legend on screen at the end, the first two or three Enigma's were found by British ships and then a US ship caught another one near the end of the war. I hate to quibble further (or do I?), but the part of Eddie (Terrence ""T.C."" Carter), the black cook who gets to play an equal role as the crew dwindles, bears on the film's rather unrealistic treatment of race relations. Except for an early comment about how he finds out important things because white officers heedlessly speak in front of him as if he were not there, no further reference is made to the servile role forced upon African-Americans in the US Navy during World War II. No one expresses a lick of prejudice toward Eddie. Even when the Germans are accused of being prejudiced (by Eddie), they are never given the chance to show it. I think the film-maker's defense is that all historical movies are really contemporary stories; ""U-571"" portrays race relations as they ought to have been rather than as they were. To complete the Star Wars analogy--for now at least-- Hitler is the ultimate Darth Vader but since this story is more realistic than Star Wars, it is about men fighting a small but significant piece of the war against Hitler, not the pitched battles we so often see in Star Wars where there is the possibility of taking out Darth. (Though, Darth is not really the head of the Evil Empire, is he? But lets not niggle.)",U-571

Would you believe there are foreigners who have never been to America because they believe these movies are real?I'm sorry to have to break the news to you: It's make believe! Man, some of you are like the simple minded aliens in Galaxy Quest, who thought every episode of Star Trek was an historical document! I hear there are some foreigners who are actually gullible enough to believe Fargo is a true story!Hollywood is not the Department of Historical Documentaries, and it's not the Ministry of Patriotic Propaganda, which I suppose is the way movies are actually made in some countries. Sorry, but Americans do not go to movies like this for patriotic inspiration; they go to be entertained. And the Hollywood studios don't make them out of patriotic duty, they make them to make money, and mainly for American audiences. I, for one, was entertained. And I think most non-xenophobic viewers would be, too.I was skeptical at the beginning, afraid it would be another action movie with cartoonish characters and a shallow, improbable plot. But the movie did a good job of setting things up, especially with the captain explaining to his No. 1 why he was not ready for command, and the duties command entailed. The acting, all around was very good, the directing was fine, the script was well above average in creating and holding tension over a sustained period. My heart was beating hard and fast through much of the movie, so it worked.Yes, I have seen the full version of Das Boot, along with the entire commentary track, which is one of the finest movies ever made. It was a composite of actual historical events. The fictional Hunt for Red October was based loosely on rumors of some possible secret events described in the non-fiction history, Blind Man's Bluff. U-571 makes no claims to being based on any historical events. IT IS FICTION! To enjoy most Hollywood movies you must be willing to suspend disbelief. If you can't, go watch a National Geographic or BBC documentary (I have seen some BBC documentaries that had less historical accuracy than this movie, namely the Rome series).(Spoiler:)That said, at the end of the movie, the producers pay tribute to those historical events some posters claim the movie maligns:-- ""This movie is dedicated to the bravery of Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials from U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic:-- May 9, 1941 -- Enigma machine and coding documents captured by from U-110 by HMS Bulldog and HMS Aubretia of the Third Escort Group, Royal Navy.-- October 30, 1942 -- Short weather cipher captured from U-559 by HMS Petard of the Royal Navy -- June 4, 1944 -- Enigma machine and coding documents captured from U- 505 by U.S. Navy Task Force 22.3.""It's generally a good idea to actually watch the entire movie before writing a review. And when watching a movie like this with an historical setting, it's a good idea to go online and read about the actual history of the period. If a movie like this can inspire viewers to learn more about history, that's a good thing. But a fictional movie can sometimes breathe life into dry historical accounts, which I think U-571 does, and better than many movies made during World War II, which were, indeed, made in part to provide patriotic inspiration.I hope viewers will follow up by watching the episode about submarine warfare in the BBC's excellent 1973 documentary series, ""The World at War."" It is a good place to start, but I feel it doesn't fully explain why the German U-boats ultimately proved so vulnerable. Some other notes. I talked to a submariner, and he said that every member of the crew was cross trained on every other member's duty stations, even the cook. This is hinted at in U-571. Yes, the Allies had an Enigma machine from the beginning of the war. It was smuggled out, piece by piece by Polish cryptographers. The Allies still needed the daily code settings, and the new four-rotor version introduced in 1942 for U-boat traffic. To decipher daily settings, they used an early digital computer at Bletchley Park called Colossus, part of the Ultra project, supervised by Alan Turing. (The ABC computer was the first fully functional digital computer.)Ultra was one of the technological devices that helped the Allies win the war, along with RADAR and the analog computer Norden bomb sight, which was kept secret long after the war, and so is little mentioned in films. While the Germans had Enigma machines, the Americans invented SIGSALY, encrypted PCM AD and DA spread spectrum companding voice transceivers. (You may have something similar in your pocket.) The Germans and Japanese hadn't a clue how to decipher the transmissions. It was called the Green Hornet because it sounding like buzzing to an undecoded listener. Bet you didn't know that (it was secret). I think all American fiction movies and TV shows should be banned from export because foreigners, especially children, often think they are real. This won't happen because so many foreigners insist on watching American shows, even when they say they are junk.

79,Jerique,Greatest War Cinema Experience!,10,24 July 2010,"What is it that makes U-571 stand out amongst war movies such as Behind Enemy Lines, Saving Private Ryan or Pearl Harbor? Is it perhaps, the ensemble cast of top names such as Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel? Is it the production design of the submarine ships themselves? Is it the lighting and cinematography? Or is it the gripping tale of the United States Navy securing the German Enigma? It's all of these things and none of them.U-571 is charged and driven in a powerhouse action thriller. It's nothing short of extraordinary. It's the most amazing war film I've ever been a part of. Yes, part of -not just watched. U-571 is so authentic, thanks to an retired Admiral of submarining on set, that you feel a part of every explosion when a depth charge shakes the foundation of the submarine.Production designer Wm Ladd Skinner should be commended for his ability to re-create the submarines and set design to make you feel claustrophobic as much as the actors in the scenes. Along with Oliver Wood's ability to capture the character of the film with a feeling of claustrophobic and unrelenting pressure for these characters.Let's not forget writer-director Jonathan Mostow, who is truly a marvel director in my mind. He was inspired to write this fictional tale about historical facts by visiting a submarine. He was so fascinated that he created this movie. It's a masterpiece of a tale and while it's not based on or created from a true story, it has a lot of historical accuracies to it.My most favourite part of this film is watching with the volume way up, the lights all off, and just experiencing the quietness of being in the submarine and just anticipating the characters actions. A ten second shot of Matthew McConaughey saying nothing and just looking simply terrified of those depth charges is amazing to watch. There is not one shot of this movie that is boring. It's paced so perfectly and each character is individually developed with perfection.While no movie is perfect, U-571 comes intensely close to being a movie that is perfect. Short from model shots and some CGI effects that are somewhat obvious after multiple viewings, this movie is a perfect movie all around.I can personally watch this movie over and over in a week's time and still not be bored nor sick of it. During it's action sequences, during it's quietness, during it's talking and development periods, this movie is an experience like no other film you've ever seen.

Those are the films where north american soldiers are the only ones capable of any wit, wisdom, intelligence and courage.Unfortunately, by now the rest of the world is a bit brighter, and we know that, really, Ben Affleck didn't save Great Britain from the Germans. There is an undeniable and deep love and respect for all veterans and U.S. soldiers that lost their lives in Europe during both World Wars from the rest of the world, the kind of respect that only comes from defending an ideal with their lives. It's Hollywood who is keen on destroying those heroes' reputation by making them seem so superior as to be ridiculous.In summary, this film is a parody of the amazing ""Das Boot"". It's quite obvious that the same things will happen in any submarine: depth charges, marine battles, etc. But U-571 makes everything seem sweet: there is no claustrophobia, the crew gets along pretty well, they kill every german in sight, and even a destroyer. Das Boot shows a destroyed boat, terribly strained relationships, a sense of quiet desperation and resignation. Where U-571 plays glorious fanfare, Das Boot counters with powerful silence. Where Das Boot puts grime, U-571 substitutes pretty faces. Where Das Boot has realism, U-571 doesn't.But most insulting of all, where englishmen should have been, U-571 cleverly substitutes them with U.S. soldiers. Oh, the nerve.Bottom line: this movie makes for a great surround sound demo disc, or a nice coaster. Hollywood is still clueless when it comes to making war movies.

Naturally, we're treated to subtle reasons why those Germans are a nasty lot, as they machine gun survivors off of sunken vessel. Very subtle. Obviously, no one on the Production crew ever heard of Blechly Park or the fact that the British actually retrieved the first one. Yup, nothing like filling up your chest with steam, and stealing thunder from your allies.

The characters have personal conflicts which seem to have been devised by a computer.  Apparently the producers thought that stealing the Enigma machine and thereby saving the free world is not enough of a goal--the characters must also attain personal redemption. The costuming and editing are confusing in the initial confrontation on the submarine, and it is hard to follow the action.  But this confusion is soon overshadowed by the increasingly unbelievable plot developments and the convenient durability of a certain U-boat.  The most unforgivable transgression is that this film manages to make Matthew McConaughey and Jon Bon Jovi look unattractive.",U-571

Alas the story is not about the Enigma machine and despite the very impressive sets it's not even about submarines or submariners it's a story about an XO coming of age.A few irritating things about the movie (1) given a few hours and a little plaque the US Navy can make one of their ""old"" subs look like a U-boat (2) Germans are portrayed as ineffective unable to do anything with their own U-boat which the Yanks can then fix in a hour (3) Bad guys can't shot (4) lots of weary creaking metal (5) impersonating a German officer is OK (6) who actually sank the 1st sub and why (7) why not use marines (8) can you really whisper into a microphone and have a guy in an engine room hear you? Also the tension building scenes are imho overdone as are some of the fight scenes.Despite the above the movie has very good sets which might add to the sense of being there, if you like sub movies you'll probably put up with the flaws.",U-571

87,headhunter46,A reasonably good depiction of life on submarine during wartime.,7,13 March 2013,"I enjoyed this movie because it dealt with the complications that can arise during combat. I felt it did a good job with depicting what it would be like to serve on a submarine.It saddens me to see several reviews that are scathing in nature because the reviewer felt the movie slighted all nations other then the US.To the credit of the movie makers, at the end of the movie was a message that went something like this, ""This movie is dedicated to all the brave sailors of the allies who risked their lives during WWII."" I will agree this movie makes the Americans appear to be head and shoulders above the Germans they were fighting, but it was made by Hollywood, don't be mad at the whole USA.The ending credits make it clear the British were the first to capture an enigma. I guess the negative comments are from those who didn't wait to see the ending credits otherwise they would know that. I like to learn where the movie was made and how. Near the end credit was given where due. It clearly stated: 9 May 1941 HMS Bulldog and HMS Aubretia captured an enigma from U-110.30 Oct. 1942 HMS Petard captures a weather cipher from U-559.4 June 1944 U.S. Navy task group 22.3 captured an enigma from U-505.Each incident was important as the Germans would change the codes at any time they suspected the enigma had been compromised. It was a major breakthrough when the Brits were able to figure out how the enigma worked. My hat is off to them.I hope everyone who watches this movie on DVD in the future will go to the special features and see how much effort went into making this movie as realistic as possible. They actually built a whole copy of a U-boat.The U-505 is on display in Chicago. I have walked through that old girl and watched the video of her capture. She is one of four U boats that are now a museum piece and she is the only surviving copy of the type IXC.The companies that made parts for U-505 donated replacements free of charge when they learned she would be a museum piece.Watch the movie with an open mind and I think you will find it entertaining.",U-571

To explain something to the audience in simplistic terms rather than go into long winded in depth historical analysis. To shorten something due to the practicalities of film making etc.This film goes way beyond 'artistic license' it is frankly stupid. Whats frightening is that many people will now believe they know some history based on this awful film. It is totally inaccurate, totally implausible and totally unbelievable.

There are some exciting battle scenes and there are men acting bravely under duress, but the bottom line is it offers nothing that we haven't seen before in other movies.Matthew McConaughey makes an unlikely senior officer of an American sub who takes over command when the captain (Bill Paxson) is killed.  Harvey Keitel is the chief petty officer, an old salt who's seen action in WWI.  Jon Bon Jovi plays one of the seamen.  As you can see, this isn't John Wayne and Lee Marvin, it's MTV goes to war.The true story of the capture of the Enigma and the code book in 1942 actually involved a British commando team, not an American one as shown in this film, and there wasn't any dramatic confrontation with a German destroyer.  I know this is a bone of contention with the Brits, our stealing their thunder.The producers could just as easily made this film with a British cast and stuck more closely to the truth, but I think the criticism coming from across the pond belies a bit of insecurity from our allies.  It's only a movie.  It's a dramatization, not a documentary.  I've seen a number of British films where Americans are pointlessly made to look bad, so let's not make too big a deal on this point.Decent entertainment once you accept the unlikely group of seamen.",U-571
92,extravaluejotter,How America won WWII,1,19 January 2006,"Okay, this is a pretty good war story, well acted and well directed. Unfortunately, the central theme of the story is based on the actions of Royal Navy, not US Navy servicemen.Maybe in 2,000 years it'll be OK to make a film like this, when the history of WWII will have been retold (and possibly re-written) a few hundred times.Right now, when it's still in living memory, is not the time to re-write history. Any film that's based on true events is allowed a certain amount of licence with the truth, but when the filmmakers completely disregard what actually happened (British servicemen retrieving Enigma code material from a sinking U-boat, one of them drowning in the process) and send the USA to save the day, it's too much. There was no captured U-boat with an American crew. Matthew Maconahey did not win WWII for us. Many people will say ""Hey, it's only a movie, don't get so uptight!"" Tell that to Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager flew his American Bell X-1 past Mach 1 in 1947, but in 1952, ""The Sound Barrier"" (an entirely fictional movie in which a plucky Brit flies past Mach 1) was released. After this film, Yeager was often asked by journalists whether he'd learned how to fly supersonic from that guy in the British movie. At least he was still alive and therefore able to set the record straight once he was allowed to talk about what he'd done.But hey, it's only a movie, don't get so uptight!If you tell an audience that a film is based on true events they will think that the film is the truth, because it's the easiest way to process what they've seen.

The effects and the sets are very well done but the characters are a different story entirely. There is very little in the way of good acting, even considering the caliber of the cast. Character development is almost nonexistant. The only good thing about the character development is they kill Bon Jovi. He should stick to making music that sucks and should stay away from lending his suck talents to movies. The U-571 itself looks very good and realistic and the DVD shows the construction of all the sets and the sub. Matthew McConaughey does an average job and I can say the same for Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel. I was expecting more action. There is some action but I was expecting more.

Oh, I am sorry, I guess that I laughed so much that I thought it was a satire of the genre without having much of the outrageousness of satires.  As you can tell, I think that this is a horrid, horrid movie. I laughed and laughed at the overall bad quality of the movie.  It was so cliched, that if you saw the preview, and have any knowledge of the genre whatsoever, you can predict every event that will happen in the movie within five minutes after the title.Plot-Cliche after cliche.  SPOilERS SPOILERS WARNING WARNING SPOILERS SPOILERS WARNING WARNING  Ok, the plot of this movie is a German U-boat has been broken by a couple of American depth charges.  The Americans find out it is in distress.  Meanwhile, McCrappahay finds out that he will not get to command a ship due to the general's lack of recommendation.  If you can't figure out the rest you are in bad shape.  He is on board for the U-boat take-over, and the American boat is torpedoed with the general on-board. Matt takes over, and the U-boat is fixed.  Then, a German destroyer finds them and a battle ensues.  As per usual, the americans win and matt gains respect.  if you haven't seen this style of movie before, send me a message. I mean it's McHales Navy meets any war movie.  minus the intentional humor. Don't forget the all-important self-sacrificeDialogue-the worst.  Matt gives such trite, scripted words of encouragement that run along the lines of ""You can do it.  Reach for that star.""  This inspires SPOILER self-sacrifice END SPOILER Keital says ""I'll set sail with you any day of the week.""  I hung my head in shame.  'Nuff said.Direction-Worse than the direction in Breakdown.  At least breakdown was moderately tense and interesting.  They had unnecessary close-ups, bad angles (and I thought that Redneck Zombies had better direction and angles), and just overall suckiness.Special effects-Good.  About the best thing of the movie, although I couldn't help but think of Titanic when the American ship sinks (in commercials).  The explosions were nice.  SPOILER why do the Germans bomb so much smarter than the Americans with depth charges?  is a torpedo really powerful enough to disintegrate a whole ship?  wouldn't it take at least two?  why does the dead body get torpedoes out of a FAULTY TUBE?  Just curious.Music-THE WORST music ever made for a movie.  I laughed so hard at what it was trying and failing miserably at accomplishing.  It was so completely awful that we all cringed at the music.So, if you are in the mood for a good comedy, go see U-571.  Or, if you can get past all of the essential plot conventions, bad dialogue, retarded music, boring movie, and awful people commenting behind you about how bad this movie is (i.e. me) then see this movie when there is nobody in the theater.

They appeared to be absolutely authentic. I was, alas, a lot less impressed by the story. The heroic sailors in this epic had enough adventures for an entire war. A strong ability to suspend disbelief is needed for one to enjoy this movie. Nevertheless, the special effects were excellent and my seven year-old grandson loved it.""I recently saw it again on Universal HD and thought that I would extend my earlier comments. First, the 5.1 soundtrack is outstanding. In fact, its sound effects won the Oscar and it was nominated for its overall sound, too. The appearance of the film in high definition was also marvelous. Its weakness was how badly miscast its star, Matthew McConaughey, was. He is wonderful in light romantic comedies, where his charm and good looks can effectively be brought to bear. Here, though, he plays a hard-bitten careerist naval officer with a skinhead hair cut and no sense of humor. He simply lacked the chops to pull it off. An action hero McConaughey is not.Bill Paxton was equally miscast but that didn't do too much damage because of his relatively small role. He plays the captain of a submarine that is on a super-secret mission to retrieve the Enigma code machine from a disabled German U-boat. The always reliable Harvey Keitel plays the chief of the boat and, as usual, is very effective.The photography of the scenes inside the submarines was well done but, it seemed to me, derivative of Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot.""

The U-Boat service had the highest rate of mortality of WWII but if all U-Boats had been built like the one in this film no U-Boat crewmen would have died, the sub managed to survive multiple close range detonations from depth charges. Every submarine film cliché was here and grossly over done, for example the US crew on the U-Boat, officer that has to prove himself, check! NCO who is a Saint and assists the previously mentioned officer, check! Young nervous crew member who dies heroically, check!

98,bjones,Slightly Off Technically But a Great Action Story,9,25 April 2000,"As a former submarine sailor I had high expectations going in to see this film. I have been aboard all of the types shown here and more, American ""S"" Boats, German ""U"" boats and I served on the crew of a WWII era boat Gato class boat. So, I thought the technical aspects of the crew and their handling of the US sub were pretty well done. The technical advisor should be highly commended for translating some real submarine feel to this film.The American Navy was not a participant in the early captures of Enigma equipment, although they did capture both a U-Boat and an Enigma machine and books later in the war. That was pure Hollywood, of course, but artistic license prevails. I personally would have liked to see a more modern action yarn of some of the incredible actual exploits of real American subs in WWII. There are many, many stories to choose from. Even a bio-epic of the career of someone like Dick O'Kane would have surpassed this in real action. Imagine a fresh pass at the special effects in something like ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" or ""Up Periscope"". But, I suppose the producers were looking for a fresh angle, which this was. I just thought it opened them up for criticism for diverting from historical accuracy. As for the film:Actually, the only areas being a bit ""Hollywood"" action-wise were the depth charge attacks (detonations that close in real life would have killed the boat) and the ease with which they assumed the operation of a German U-boat. It would takes weeks to assimilate all of the technical knowledge necessary to operate a strange submarine. A lot of the actual details necessary to plot a firing solution for a torpedo were left out, doubtless for drama's sake. But, other than that it wasn't too bad.One impressive aspect was an attempt to re-create an actual sub vs sub duel. One such incident, nearly identical, actually happened during the Second World War when the US boat U.S.S. Scamp had a close range duel with a Japanese sub. The Japanese boat missed and Scamp sunk her adversary when both boats fired torpedoes at each other simultaneously. In all i know of at least eight other instances where subs sank other subs.The sets and costumes were very well done. As for the action parts of the movie and the plot, it was well done and well acted. Paxton and McCounaghy were great in their roles as was the impeccable Harvey Keitel. In fact, Keitel reminded me a lot - actually exactly - of a real Navy Chief Petty Officer I worked for once. He was a joy to watch perform as Chief Klough. The others should aspire to be so good one day. A young actor named Jack Noseworthy also did a great job with his role as the German speaking sailor, Wentz. Also noteworthy was Erik Palladino, a reluctant hero. I only wish they had done more with the Paxton character's background; the name Dahlgren is close to royalty in the Navy. And a more fitting tribute should have gone to the ""Trigger"" character played by Tom Guiry. In real life his deed would have warranted at least a Navy Cross, perhaps a Medal of Honor.But, the real star here were the special effects. It was all very well done and a very enjoyable movie to see, over all. A top quality action film.",U-571
99,Keyser Soze-12,As cliched as it gets,4,19 October 2000,"U-571 is nothing more than Das Boot with a higher budget, no realism whatsoever, not historically accurate, and recycled from over 50 submarine movies.  I didn't hate this movie, but I don't like it, at all.  If you want a real sub movie, don't waist money on this.The only thing this movie has going for it is that the action is great.  The special effects are definitely better than The Hunt for Red October's (not that I'm disrespecting Hunt in any way, but its special effects did leave a bit to be desired).  The sound is great, and the tension is also well done. But, when you look past the action movie coating, this movie is nothing but Armageddon in a sub.I don't mean to say that there are asteroids in this movie; only that the movie throws away the chance to be good only to be a pumped up action movie. I repeat, this is an A-C-T-I-O-N MOVIE, not a war movie.  Holy God, is this not a war movie. Oh, and as far as historical goes, this movie is almost sinful.  I am not one to talk about historical accuracy.  After, I loved Gladiator.  While this movie is not about something that never happened, it is instead much worse.  It was the British, not the Americans, who found the Enigma machine. This is just another example of those stupid American producers over at Universal who make the rest of us look bad.  I swear, any British person watching this movie will be offended.  This movie takes a great accomplishment away from Britain. I also can't figure out why Harvey Keitel is in this movie.  He is a great actor; this movie doesn't deserve him.  I guess he was low on cash, and the script could have looked good on paper.Basically, if you want an entertaining yet stupid sub movie, rent this.

(""It's all in German!"", he exclaims as though the brass didn't brief him that Germans didn't mark all their U-Boat dials in good ole American). When will Hollywood quit making this kind of tripe. Not any time soon apparently seeing Behind Enemy Lines is now playing. Revisionist history in the extreme, from the capture of the enigma machine right down to the black cook who doesn't seem to confront 40's bigotry whatsoever as he goes about handling every onboard task imaginable. Not likely I'm sad to say. The special effects are typically exaggerated and the bubble-gum action repetitious and lacking any kind of tension. Pacing and realistic suspense is what made Das Boot the great film it is. It was also about the real fear men face when they're trapped in a fragile sub and at the mercy of enemy depth charges and air attacks. U-571 is an atypically brainless Hollywood imitation short on realism and long on noise and phony heroics. Written and directed by a hack and made for an exceedingly stupid action market.

You're already dead! If, as some pundit said, adventure is some other guy or guys in a hell of a fix a long way from where you are, then this film represents adventure with a very large capital A. Briefly, the crew of an old S-boat (late WW1 vintage submarine) in 1942 is charged with capturing a disabled German U-boat in the Atlantic in order to get the coding machine known as Enigma. With this, the allies would be able to track U-boat positions and deployments, and slow the terrific loss of allied shipping. They do get control of U-571, but their own sub is sunk by another German sub, forcing the boarding party to save themselves in the all-but-sinking U-571. They manage to do so in spite of a later attack by a German destroyer, and keep U-571 afloat long enough to get rescued in the western approaches.I won't even attempt to detail the horrific ordeal of these guys portrayed in a non-stop succession of special effects not seen in any previous submarine flics. Not just the sea and hostile enemy vessels assail the remnant of the S-boat's crew, but also there is dissension in their ranks, a commanding officer liked but not entirely trusted by all the crew, and the captive German captain of U-571 who manages to get loose. When the sinking U-571 begins the plan to sink the attacking German destroyer, you will certainly inch forward on the couch! Not just the amazing special effects but ingenious and seamless editing add to the non-stop thrills. The fact that the characters are believable and well portrayed adds to the general quality.But, you must keep in mind that the story thus unfolded is fiction. Allied crews did retrieve Enigma machines from U-110 in 1941 and U-505 in 1944, but not in the way shown here. I would venture the opinion that what we are shown would have been impossible, though some submarine crews did manage to survive some really difficult situations, both in peacetime and war. Some critics have complained that the scene early in the film showing the crew of U-571 machine gunning a boatload of allied survivors is manipulative. Maybe so, but fairly late in the war in the South Atlantic the crew of a German sub did just that to the crew of a merchant vessel they had sunk. It is a well documented case.

A German submarine has been disabled, but not sunk. A team of Naval commandos is assigned the task of getting aboard the sub, capture the device, then safely return to home port. Simple, but the plan goes awry when the team manages to get aboard the German sub. A destroyer from the German navy sinks their own sub, and the US Navy team is left to return safely to base in a crippled German U-boat. To make matters worse, the Germans have gotten wise to their plan, and are making efforts to put the crippled U-boat to rest permanently, at the bottom of the ocean. Depth charges are dropped every few minutes, just to shake the viewers up, and attempts are made to make the U-boat an effective weapon to use against the destroyer trying to sink the craft.The cast includes Matthew McConaughy as the leader of the US team, and ably backed by Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton, and David Keith.

In this film, Matthew McConaughey leads a team of naval officers to steal a German encoder known as the Enigma.  They take over a German sub, and attempt to finish their mission, when major problems ensue. (don't want to give anything away)The best part of this movie is the effects and the tension that it created within the submarine.  The special effects are amazing, the camera work is terrific as you feel the dizzy, claustrophobic sense of tension aboard this ship.  That being said, it's the type of movie where you only realize afterwards what was missing.First, there are problems of historical accuracy: Although the end credits thank the real Navy efforts to steal the German encoders during the War, it was the British, and never the American Navy, who were involved.  This isn't a terrible thing, but it's crediting the wrong people. There are a number of other plot holes as well.Second is the acting.  With several exceptions, most notably McConaghey's solid performance, there is some bad casting and dry acting.  Harvey Keitel ?  He is listed as Chief Klough, but then why does he report to McConaughey's Lt. Tyler ?

110,poc-1,A bad movie made badly,4,25 July 2006,"The plot of this movie is that the US Navy must capture the German Enigma encryption machine from a German submarine.How do I hate this movie, let me count the ways:The mistreatment of history in this movie has been documented in many places, so I won't retell it save to mention that it is highly disrespectful of the seamen who lost their lives recovering the real enigma machine from the sinking U559. Then you have a script which is filled with as many holes as the eponymous submarine. Then you have a plot which is thoroughly predictable. Then you have Matthew McConaughy who presence has ruined several quite decent flicks. Here he is just emblematic of its awfulness. Then you have poor special effects. Though I do confess the surface shots of what seemed to be real depth charges were a rare highlight. Then you have annoying characters who don't behave like real people in order to create artificial subplots. Then you have Harvey Keitel who has some awful lines, he should stick with Tarantino films. Then you have Hollywood who paid for this calamity. I don't hate Hollywood per se but this is the stereotypical example of what they do to history and heroism.Oh how I was praying that those depth charges would drown them all, but no, even when the sub is hit almost directly by several depth charges, everyone is fine apart from a few popped rivets.If you want to watch a really good submarine movie, watch Das Boot. If you want to watch a decent Hollywood made submarine movie, watch Crimson Tide. If you want to watch a Hollywood movie which is a bit silly that is still fun to watch, go rent The Hunt for Red October. In fact the Simpson Tide is better than this.

111,flickjunkie-3,Horribly Inaccurate.,4,16 December 2000,"*Warning: Spoilers*I was the only person in the cinema for U-571. I don't know why I saw it, but bad reviews and an empty cinema secured this movie as bad.While on a 48-hour leave from duty, Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), along with his crew, are stripped of their leave and given a new objective to follow. Their mission: to impersonate German soldiers, sneak their way onto the German u-boat U-571, and capture the Enigma, the decoder for the secret code tha is used by the Germans to search and sink opponent submarines. Their mission is a success, only until their own sub is destroyed and the US crew is trapped in a German sub in hostile waters. Now it is up to Tyler and his crew to make sure that the Enigma reaches the hands of the American authorities without allowing the Germans to realize that is has been stolen; otherwise, the mission is a failure.A question: what the hell was the point? The basic plot was that the dumb ass American's who expect to win a war by using a German U-boat. This tells you how clever the writing is, and how clever the entire film is going to be. There are two good performances from Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi were are strong and believeable, but the rest of actors let them down with embarrassing, clumsy performances. The direction and design are both stupid, you can actually see the end of the tanks, which is a big no-no.Disappointing, silly and corny - U-571 earns 3 points for good sound and impressive effects. McCoughaney better watch his back...I rate U-571 4 out of 10.",U-571
112,Ysman,Something was missing . . .,5,27 April 2000,U-571's was a predictable action yarn with nothing much to note.  The story line did a great job of setting up its all too deliberate punches.  Bill Paxton basically outlined each one of Matthew McConaughey's future actions in the first 20 minutes of the film.  The action sequences did well to build some suspense but the computer graphics looked terrible.  The fact that the background was fake was painfully obvious.  The ending made it seem as if the screenwriters had run out of material or the director had run out of film.  All in all the film just left me wanting something better.,U-571

They get to the sub alright and as they are about to leave, their own sub is blown up. They have to board the German boat and try to  get away. These opening scenes are very well done- but it's when the boat is destroyed that everything goes wrong. It takes a long time for the audience to realize who has died and who hasn't. The movie never does make this clear. Then, the entire second hour of the film is the crew bracing themselves for depth charges, and then repairing leaks. It's boring. U-571 is nothing like the wonderful submarine movies like DAS BOOT or THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER- those films make us feel what it might be like to be aboard an actual sub- this one just recycles cliche and cliche.",U-571

115,dima-12,Surprisingly incompetent attempt of creating suspense,2,27 May 2000,"`U-571` is a movie that is so fundamentaly ill-conceived that I must express my sincere disgust with it.It is a failed WW-2 submarine epic that can be used as cure for insomnia.Mostow wrote it and directed it in such a way that he not only mad a bad movie but he also made me question his overall film knowledge.Because this movie looks like a work of a man who haven`t seen cult classics of the genre.If he had seen submarine epics like `The Hunt For Red October`or `Das Boot` or `The 49th Parallel` he would at least try to use those flicks as a blueprint.But no,Mostow sticks to his own vision which is painfully wrong.He simulates suspense without characters and results are hillarious.The only `character` in this movie that resembles a personality is played by Matthew McConaughey who is extremely uncharismatic and who should stay focused on low-profile direct-to-theater-far-away-from-me-movies like `EdTV`.  Direction is dull and script can be described as a collection of missed opportunities.Mostow,Montgomery and Ayer sink the movie when Americans enter the German sub. Authors chose the worst possible path after that potent moment and they turned a suspenser into a massive bore. By the time Americans meet the German destroyer the audience is brought to the brink of a suicide and the climax is particularly unsatisfying. `U-571` has other barely believable aspects.First of all,I can`t believe that a major studio actually released this.I also can`t believe that studio payed or blackmailed so many critics to say affirmative stuff about this movie.I mean flops like `Saving Private Ryan` are in line with this piece of incompetence.I hoped that Hollywood wouldn`t let anyone make another `Saving Private Ryan`but here we go they did it again.",U-571
116,Thorsten_B,Unsinkable,7,12 June 2004,"What I like best about films is when they manage to be entertaining while at the same thing avoiding to repeat the common clichés of their genres. 'U-571' is quite a good example of how that can be achieved. If you like submarine movies like 'Crimson Tide' but wish that had some more war-like-realistic action packaged into all the thrill, then this one may serve your wishes. McConaughey, though usually not the best of actors (but quite good in 'Frailty'), has one of his more memorable roles. Bill Paxtons part is shorter, but it's always a joy to see him act (not to mention if his acts and directs, as was also the case in 'Frailty'). Harvey Keitel has had much worse parts than this one. The German Thomas Kretschmann is fine too, and Jon Bon Jovi looks twenty years younger than he actually is. Direction and script, given it is typical Hollywood warhorse, are good as well, and Richard Marvins music score offers a congenial essay in orchestral tour-de-force. If you don't mind that the historic reality looked a bit different (but who minds that when watching fiction?), then 'U-571' is one of the better entries into the genre.",U-571
117,Steven Reynolds,U-need-a-better-story,5,12 May 2000,"A wonderful historical premise, a promising cast, and a writer-director who has previously demonstrated some real talent, all only serve to make this cliched and boring film even more disappointing.  This is allegedly an action movie with an emotional subtext, but it fails to deliver on both counts.  Despite the high-concept - ""US navy intercepts U-boat to steal Enigma code machine, and it all goes horribly wrong"" - nothing much really happens.  The commandeered U-boat is damaged and almost out of torpedoes, so the hapless American pirates spend the next hour limping around the ocean floor wondering how they're going to get out of this mess.  I expected so much more from this - more action, more tension, more story.  It feels like they shot the second draft of the screenplay - the one where the hero's character is only half-developed and some of the plot points still need to be worked out.  It looks hurriedly cobbled together, too, with special effects that are annoyingly second-rate and some pretty static camera work. This wasn't a mega-budget movie, so maybe they spent most of the money on the cast.  Yet this doesn't pay off, either, because the cast is wasted. They're given nothing to do.  Paxton and Keitel have about 20 lines between them, and McConaughey just broods.  Jon Bon Jovi disappears so early you're likely to forget he was ever in it. The ultimate problem, however, isn't the budget.  You don't need a huge budget to make a decent submarine movie.  You need a great story.  ""The Hunt For Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" both rely on great stories more than special effects.  ""U-571"" has a great story IDEA, but it's under-developed.  And it isn't helped by what has to be the most gratingly banal score since ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",U-571

It doesn't have enough power to return home so it becomes a sitting duck.  The sub, however, is carrying an enigma machine, a priceless piece of communication equipment that encrypts/decrypts German messages.  In the hands of the Allies, it could be the difference between losing and winning the war.An American sub is immediately sent out to retrieve the enigma from the German sub.  But the Germans are aware of it too and are trying to reach it from the opposite direction before the enemy can get their hands on it. What follows is a non-stop thrill ride.",U-571
119,mercury-26,Rock the boat,7,29 April 2000,"As I sat and waited for this movie to begin, I had to sit through a number of really bad trailers for really bad movies-except one: Director Wolfgang Petersen (""In The Line of Fire,"" ""Air Force One"") has a new film coming out June 30th called ""The Perfect Storm."" Petersen's come a long way, but his masterpiece is still ""Das Boot,"" the epic German World War II submarine film that really set the standard for all underwater thrillers that followed.As if the trailer weren't reminder enough of Boot's influence on it, ""U-571"" begins with none other than the crew of a German U-boat struggling against depth charges dropped by a British destroyer. Writer/director Jon Mostow is tipping his hat to Petersen here, given the way we're allowed to get to know these characters a little bit. These are not the inhuman, evil, cold-blooded Nazis depicted in American cinema, but simply a crew of men under orders, doing their duty, trying to survive. Of course, this is an American film and we're soon informed who we're supposed to be rooting for.
Mostow wasn't trying to make a better film than its predecessors, just a Bigger, Faster, and Louder one. He knows his limits: He doesn't have Denzel or Hackman. Or Connery. Or Baldwin. ""U-571"" bravely charts its own course, happy to be something that neither ""Boot,"" nor ""Hunt For Red October,"" nor ""Crimson Tide"" were: an all-out action flick. Mostow's crew consists of names like McConaughey, Keitel, Paxton, Bon Jovi, Weber. None of these guys (well, except maybe Keitel) is going to demand the big speech, the scenery-chewing dialogue. Their job is to say the lines they're given and look mean or intense or afraid-whatever the scene calls for. The film's one developed character, Matthew McConaughey's Lieutenant Andrew Tyler, provides enough to keep the boat, and the film, afloat.I'm not going to get into the details of the plot because it's really no better or worse than the plot of the other underwater thrill rides you've seen. I will say that it's set near the end of World War II, at which time Allied forces were trying to capture coding devices that made German naval communications undecipherable. Mostow's story has a few unexpected twists, with a script that often leads you astray of what will actually happen. It also seems designed, often at the expense of historical accuracy, to deliver as many opportunities for things to blow up as possible. In fact, it's been a while since I've seen or heard things blow up quite as well as they did in this film.Do try to see ""U-571"" in a well-equipped theater, but make sure you take in its superior elder statesmen at some point.Grade: B-",U-571
120,manojitbaidya,Great Movie... Must Watch,10,9 June 2021,At first I thought it will be a boring time pass film. But I'm totally wrong. It's an excellent movie. Second World War's timeline...

121,robsellke,"Exciting plot, lots of action, but tries to milk too much drama",7,21 May 2000,"U-571 was a German submarine captured by British sailors, not American. That in itself lowered my opinion of the movie a bit.  Also, the ending was rather predictable, although it actually happened in real life.  Another bad thing about it was the overdose of sentimental drama.  In war, people die. It happens.  Countless other movies show this too, as well as real-life events.  But in ""U-571"", the focus of the movie isn't the horror of war, the focus is the heroic actions of sailors.  So, it seems kind of cheesy to me that the director would take a five second break away from the action to have everyone cry about somebody dying.  All in all, this movie captures attention and leaves you satisfied, but lacks a bit in development.",U-571
122,pete36,Almost a WWII era propaganda movie,5,25 May 2003,"(major spoilers ahead)Based on a true story, it is the plan to get hold of the German code machine Enigma by  capturing it from a U-boat.  This feat was actually pulled off by the British Navy  by scuttling  a  sinking sub already abandoned by its crew.  But as this is a US movie Hollywood takes over : the boarding party becomes entirely US and movie turns into some high adrenalin but ludicrous adventure caper.U-571 is very reminiscent  to  those   propaganda movies made during WWII to boost morale.  It's got all the simplistic ingredients and stereotypes: on the one hand you have the Germans : Nazi b*****ds all single one of them, either  fanatics or cowards, and ofcourse  very lousy shots.    Just to make case in point that they are no good ,  at the very beginning of the movie, they machinegun a lifeboat full with survivors of a just torpedoed cargo.On the other hand the US sub crew : resourceful, smart,  brave, self-sacrificing, multicultural (even including a  black cook) and above all : they can hit anything, no matter the odds.The basic premise may ring true historic wise, the rest of the movie is ludicrous. Just imagine this : the US crew, down to about half a dozen, manning a crippled German sub, succeed in sinking another U-boat and a German destroyer !  This would even be deemed too wild by WWII propaganda standards. So as for sheer accuracy and credibility the script is sub (haha)-zero . Even the assault to capture the U-boat is  ridiculous, attacking with mere handguns  through the various parts of the submarine while Jerry is waiting for them with  machineguns.I also have to admit I couldn't care much for the American crew, except for David Keith as a though OSS-officer, but  he gets sadly  offed mid-picture. Matthew McNaughty is pretty annoying as the leader,  so it is  a 'controlled' Harvey Keitel, as the CPO, who is the most likeable of the characters.I will admit though that  U-571 is  rather fast-paced  and reasonably well directed  so during the movie  you tend to forget most of the improbabilities. So director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-scripted and produced, does an above average job, but if it was sufficient to hand him the job to helm `Terminator III' remains to be seen.Many reviewers refer to the Germanmade `The Boat' as the prime example of the quintessential submarine movie.  An excellent choice undoubtedly, but let me (as also IMDb does)  point to a  US flick from the fifties: `The Enemy Below' which starred  Robert Mitchum and Curd Jurgens and was directed by actor Dick Powell.  This is a solid and realistic account of a duel on the high seas between a US destroyer and a U-boat .  It stays clear of the usual  clichés and Nazi stereotyping (quite an achievement for US movie from 1957) and builds up to  a very exciting climax.Conclusion :  U-571 is  fairly entertaining until you begin to see through the enormous plot holes and the sheer incredibility of the whole thing.",U-571

Why can't someone make a movie that is factual about some of the most interesting things in American history? If you want to just watch a movie that is fiction this may just be what you want.

125,pmcollectorboy,Cliched as hell but a lot of fun(minor spoilers),6,11 May 2000,"And let's face it, some people thrive on cliche.  That's why some people liked The Phantom Menace.  First of all, why do some people go into a theater with some type of baggage that prevents them from enjoying a movie? This movie is not trying to be like Das Boot, and screw the liberal use of artistic license to rewrite history.  Okay, people are entitled to those opinions, and maybe I'm in the minority by watching a movie at face value, but that's the way I watch a movie.  I rate a movie by how well it kept me engaged, how well it did its job, how well it kept me from looking at my watch.  This movie did all that extremely well.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and I couldn't tell you how many times I flinched. Not all movies are going to be about plot twists, intrigue, and character development.  Considering this movie throws all the political intrigue out the window and says, ""Let's blow $#!T up."", of course it's not going to be an intelligent movie.  It's going to be a movie that's supposed to keep you breathless from the suspense and danger, and this movie did that very well for me.  Some of things done to keep the suspense were cheap shots, but everything was still fun.  And speaking of character development, this movie didn't have one hero hogging the spotlight.  Watching the teamwork involved in operating an old sub and surviving the situation was enough to make me think that everybody was real and that everybody was a hero.  Heck, I even found myself asking ""What happened to Trigger?""  I even teared up as the proud military score played at the end, and the characters watched that fine ship sink to the bottom.

128,The_Other_Snowman,Who's the Hero?,3,28 September 2013,"With only a few minor changes, this could have been a suspenseful thriller about a heroic German U-boat captain trying to take his vessel back from the Americans who have captured it, after slaughtering his crew. He's so sympathetic in his first scene -- and the Americans are so unlikable -- that I imagine the filmmakers must have panicked. They threw in a ""kick the dog"" moment, of the German captain ordering the massacre of a lifeboat full of people, just so the audience would know who was meant to be the villain.This kind of thing happens in war movies all the time. The Americans -- led by Matthew McConaughey and Harvey Keitel -- trick their way onto the U-boat and shoot just about everyone they run into. This is supposed to be heroic, because these are supposed to be the good guys. The German captain manages to hide out, and makes several attempts to sabotage the boat. This is supposed to be villainous, because he's the bad guy.Of course, the real trouble with this sort of stark morality is that the entire film is a fabrication of the screenwriters. The situation is an invention, the characters are fictional, and every action is calculated for maximum effect. U-boat crews were not known for any cruelty beyond that exhibited by the Allied submariners, and yet the makers of this movie were compelled to upgrade their historical villain into a really nasty character. The point of all this is to make an exciting action movie -- it's not a documentary, right?But then why is it a historical movie at all? Why bother making movies set in historical periods if you're just going to ignore the details? Nearly sixty years passed between the war and the movie -- so why not use the opportunity to educate the audience about what really happened, rather than simply aiming to excite them with tired clichés?Well, apart from all that, it actually is quite an exciting ride. The camera never stops moving and things never stop exploding -- and Matthew McConaughey apparently never stops shouting. McConaughey makes a great villain, but this movie designates him as the hero -- the same way most stupid action movies do.",U-571

The sound design is what stood out the most, and still stands out today. I can ""listen"" to this movie over and over again. The DVD version I saw recently has commentary by director Jonathan Mostow. In it he talks about the value of having theatre-style ""6-channel surround format (at home) because it really replicates, as close as possible, the experience of seeing a movie in the theatre."" I like watching ""older"" movies and listening to director commentary, especially when they get technical. Mostow, in his commentary, goes on to say how ""with the film to tape transfers now-a-days you can really extract a tremendous amount of visual information out of each frame."" (!) ""Film to tape.""Film, to tape, to glass master DVD, to DVD replication. Ah yes, the turn of the century technology a mere 17 years ago!Imagine, 17 years from now, we'll be mocking 4K UHD when we're sitting at home watching our favourite new-release film with some sort of organic-holographic-display-thing that looks so real it will seem like the actors are right in front of you and you can reach out and touch them; with sound so authentic you'd believe you were right there, with them, in the action.

And since the real Enigma was captured by the British, actually, we know that the story is a work of fiction.The movie starts on a German U-Boat somewhere in the Atlantic, attacking and being attacked in it's turn. It is a world of fish eat fish out here and the Germans have the upper hand. But when the U-Boat is crippled, the Americans see an opportunity to board it and get the Enigma.The directing is not that great. It is as if the director tried to recreate the scenes from ""The Hunt for Red October"" in a 2 by 4 cabin. It was ridiculous to watch a whole bunch of senior officers prancing around in a tiny cabin, inches from each other, and the pendulum mounted camera didn't help things, either.Some complain about the inaccuracy of the story, but I complain about the quality of the story. Tarantino changed history too, on occasion, but at least he did it in style. This movie looks like it was filmed in a bathtub and the action has all the credibility of a bed time story.The actors have not much to do except act scared, stiff or worried (looking at the walls, if possible).

Impossible is more the word.  I would need no less than three hands to count how many times I said to myself, ""Now that was stupid,"" during the course of this movie.  In fact, there was one point when the entire audience, as an aggregate, basically screamed the words ""Yeah, right!"" at the screen.The funny thing is, they actually had a military advisor for this film - a vice admiral, at that.  Seems to me they couldn't have listened to him, though.  I mean, granted, I don't know the first thing about military life, but I know enough about physics to realize that starting a diesel engine while underwater is a really bad idea.True, the film could be worst.  Parts of it are somewhat suspenseful, and the acting is passable.  I wouldn't recommend you pay money to see it, though.But, if you do, know this: there's no good reason to pay attention to anyone except McConaughey, Paxton, and Keitel.  Anyone else in U-571 is important for maybe ten minutes - at best.  In addition, this movie falls into the usual war movie trap of casting a whole bunch of people that look alike. And it doesn't help that they don't mention many names.  For example, even knowing the name of Jon Bon Jovi's character from the credits, I can't place him in the film (granted, his fans will recognize him, I'm sure, but, no offense to the man, I'm not one of them).Really, though, I should have known better than to go see U-571 in the first place.  It's the type of movie that's usually rated ""R"" and usually released in the summer.  So, if you think about it, the fact that it's ""PG-13"" and has come out in April speaks volumes in-of-itself.  4/10",U-571

Harvey Keitel (the most serious casualty), David Keith, and Bill Paxton are all wasted, by either being given standard-issue dialogue or early departures.  Mathew McConaghey manages to hold his head above water, however.  Problem number 2 - Josh Mostow brings no sense of excitment to the material AT ALL.  There is not one sequence that does not involve major special effects that instills a sense of 'wow' in the audience.  Steven Spielberg and Terrence Malick have raised the bar (together with Oliver Stone) on war films that a run of the mill director has no chance of coming near it, much less surpassing it ... and Josh Mostow, being that he has NO sense of visual flair whatsoever, fails miserably.  Finally, the third problem - THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, DAS BOOT, RUN SILENT RUN DEEP, and CRIMSON TIDE were all done by directors and producers who were way better than the team behind this shipwreck.  So, why the three stars?

The enigma codes were in reality recovered by the British sailors in surface ships and I am not aware of any heroic American mission to recover them.  For a start the construction of American heroes on this theme seemed wrong.  Then the plot began to drag as all the old submarine war movie cliches were rerun - the tension between CO and XO, the destroyer-submarine combat, the depth charges, the leaking pipes and the frightened faces of cocooned men hundreds of feet below the surface. The representation of the technology also wrankled me.  The rate at which charges are dropped by destroyers would make the close succession of explosions near the sub impossible.  Moreover, the closeness of those explosions at 200m depth would definitely have imploded the hull. Generally, a load of garbage.",U-571

I keep forgetting I live in Houston, though....I thought this was a good film with lots of edge of your seat suspense, good twists, and just a solid story. This is not to say that this story should be taken as historical fact.  There should be a disclaimer that comes with this movie that states any resemblance this movie may bear to what really happened during WWII is purely coincidental.  They actually do have script at the end that states some actual facts. Facts that tell the viewers that it was primarily the British who had the most to do with getting the Enigma code from the Germans.  I'd be curious to see if these end notes were there during the original screening of this film.  I know this is just Hollywood but I don't like seeing history distorted in any fashion - it makes for bad storytelling at the end.  I'm just dreading ""The Patriot"" for this reason.Historical inaccuracy aside, this movie was still a good one and it honestly had elements to it that made you feel like you were in a U-Boat during WWII. It was a bit predictable in places (I knew immediately who was slated for death) and of course you know the good guys will win no matter what the odds were.

But while I do accept this somewhat as ""fantasy"", and acknowledge that they put a dedication at the end (after the Brits protested) that it was the British who captured the Enigma from a sub first, the revisionism that comes from Hollywood insults our intelligence. Ok, so the biggest movie market is the US, but I think this kind of revisionism is just money-grubbing, in my opinion. Why am I so annoyed? I recall a recent comment from an American criticizing Canadian forces recently saying that ""you've never entered a war without the US entering first"". What?! (How about the first few years of WWI and the first couple of years of WWII?).

Submarine that picks up an S.O.S from a injured German U boat that happens to hold the key to the war at that time.....the enigma code (a type writer of some sort).  They capture the enigma code and start to transfer prisoners over to the american sub when the American sub is hit and blows leaving a skeleton crew and the injured German sub.  The rest of the film follows the crews survival in the water and there struggle to come up with an idea to contact home base for help!I appologuise to anyone that may be offended by my comments, but i must also stress that my great grandfather served and died during the war while being a loyal recruit to the royal navy.  I know its only a film....and i did enjoy its special effects and parts of its casting (Harvey Keitel and jack Noseworthy who stood out), but at the end of the day i wondered what it would be like if us british changed history for the sakes of filming distribution?Another point, there are enough good British actors to take the place of any actor that starred in this film, Jude Law, Ben Chaplin and Christian Bale to name a few.6/10 - the film as okay!",U-571

Jonathan Mostow's bland attempt allows far too many good plot twists to dissolve (being hunted by another u-boat; having a captive German officer let loose on board the sub.; a conflict of interests between a sub. commander and a Marine Major [David Keith; killed off far too early!]) in place of a hackneyed, 'Destroyer chases sub.' drama in which - awfully predictably - the crippled sub. manages to sink the mighty destroyer with it's solitary torpedo!?!  Not that these action sequences aren't handled well; but when they're as unbelievable (and therefore as undeserved) as this, who cares?  The acting is as efficient as the film; that is to say - they do what what they can with an undemanding, profoundless script, and - at the end of it all - it becomes unfortunately apparent that we have discovered precious little about the nature of war and, tragically, even less about the nature of men under fire: Surely an unforgiveable flaw in a sub-genre as potent and as definitive as the submarine movie.

The Cinematography was of extreme high quality.  The Cast was just perfect.  Matthew McConaughey had a great performance, I didn't detect even a trace of Wooderson in him in this role.  He was a deadly serious Naval Officer, and he pulled it off with flying colors.  Harvey Keitel, Jake Weber, David Keith, Bill Paxton, and little known Dave Power, who was excellent as the mechanic, all put in great supporting performances.On the critical side of things, some will say that it wasn't the true story. They would be correct, it is pretty clear after you watch the movie that the writer/director took the story from several of these missions and put together an outstanding action movie, with some historical relevance, but not actually telling a ""true"" story.

""Das Boot"" was written by a German submarine man of WWII. It was realistic, no exaggerations, except perhaps the feasting in the harbour. A human drama that took place a thousand times during the war in the Atlantic. But here with U 571 it is apparent that the US patriotism had to be satisfied. They are not interested in German heroes. They want to see US heroes. As always when the history is faked this is sometimes ridiculous. Nevertheless the film has dramatic moments. The film earned many critic especially in Britain, because the Brits were the guys who captured the Enigma"" machine, not the US. So far an audacious, almost incredible falsification of history. But be sure that this is common practice of movie makers! For the sake of entertainment. One has to understand that patriotic films have their own logic and their own legitimacy.

I have also heard that it is totally historically inaccurate, which I cannot verify as I do not know any of the history behind this movie.  So taking it purely as an action/thriller movie, it is surprisingly entertaining.  Granted, the characters were poorly developed and the plot line was relatively thin, but director Mostow should be commended for crafting an engaging picture despite these weaknesses.  The film is made in such a way that what should have been a glaring inadequacy, is really just a minor complaint.

Sure, and maybe for the sake of accuracy it should have. Perhaps there is a certain amount of American arrogance at work here, having these officers portrayed as American, but, at the risk of upsetting a lot of veterans, I don't think it matters in the long run who did what. I think what matters in the end is that it was done at all. Say what you will, but anyone who has watched U-571 has to admit it's a balanced film. The German characters in the film are every bit as human, flawed and virtuous as the Americans. The film respects both sides of the conflict equally. Speaking as a Canadian, I have to be honest about my feelings about our past war efforts. All Canadian students are taught about Canada's great victory at Vimy Ridge in World War I. It can not be denied that that was an important victory in the war and that incredible heroism was involved on the part of the soldiers. If Hollywood made a movie about the battle of Vimy Ridge and replaced the Canadian soldiers with Americans, I admit it would probably upset me, but only because I'm Canadian. My nationality would prevent me from looking at the situation objectively. Nowadays it seems odd trying to find trying to extract some source of national pride among the horrors of an old war.If people think the United States is arrogant for portraying British officers as American, the arrogance displayed as the British remind everybody, ""Don't forget. We did that,"" also has to be acknowledged. The fact is, somebody had to do it. These men did it and they are heroes. Their nationality doesn't define their heroic act, and neither does it matter if they are portrayed by Matthew McConaughey or Ewan MacGregor.

A recent example of British heroism and American villainy (Amistad where a British lawyer defends the mutineer slaves against the American courts) bombed at the box office. Wake up America, you aren't always the good guys.Ok, on to the plot problems, but first i admit I have hardly any knowledge of submarines, but the following points are worth considering: 1) Why didn't the Germans lock the hatch to the deck when they were being boarded? 2) Didn't the American crew realise the supply u-boat would show up behind them? 3) Why didn't the German captain order the crew to destroy the enigma machine while they were being boarded? 4) How come the Germans' aim with artillery and small arms was so bad? Stormtroopers in every sense... 5) Why didnt the German captain do more to damage the engine while he had the chance? 6) Why didn't more Germans fight back?The movie itself is a very straightforward WWII adventure action flick, tense and fast-paced, although the 'being a hard decision maker' subtext was both heavy handed and unnecessary. Also there was some rich manipulation prior to the boarding. The makers thought 'hmmmm not too heroic, sneaking on board a u-boat and then murdering the crew.... we'd better make the Germans look evil by executing a load of adrift Allied seamen'.

169,Oreolove,A Masterpiece,10,3 January 2002,"This is truly one of the best films I've ever seen. Despite its mediocre ratings, I find this movie to be exciting and truthful. It shows what life for those on a submarine during WWII was like. The story is superb, the acting is wonderful, and the character development makes the viewer either love or hate the character right away depending on their personality. It's a story of suspense when a navy officer and his crew must steal a German coding machine from a disabled U-Boat while the German resupply sub is on its way to save the sinking ship. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This is truly a 10 star movie.",U-571
170,dhallen,"Entertaining if not historically accurate, sometimes cliche.",6,9 October 2000,"This is an enjoyable film if you can ignore the re-writing of history and the often unbelievable plot premise. To their credit, at the end credits the makers of this film honor those who were involved in the capture of the actual Enigma equipment and documentation. If you read carefully (my 17-year-old daughter did not) you will notice that it was a British destroyer in 1941 which captured the first Enigma machine, not an American submarine (most American subs operated in the Pacific theater, I believe). 
Also, the idea of using a regular submarine crew as a boarding party, rather than specially-trained troops (or even convential US Marines) was a real stretch, as was the speed at which they figured out how to operate the German U571.If you are a fan of this genre, you may find some of the plot elements are a bit old hat (sitting out the depth charges, diving to a depth the sub supposedly cannot tolerate, etc.).Altogether, though, I enjoyed the fast pacing, the special effects and direction, and especially the acting (although the normally-animated Bill Paxton was a bit wooden in his portayal).Recommendation: see it, but don't believe it.",U-571
171,Franklin-2,Less Than Meets the Eye,2,14 May 2000,"U-571 is the kind of film that seems original to people who've never seen a submarine movie before.  The picture has cliches that were hairy during World War II, an over-active camera that gets in the way of the few good performances and makes some scenes almost totally incoherent and a script so leaden they could have put it in the ballast tanks to make the sub sink.Worst things about the picture:  1) the script giving the U.S. credit for cracking the Enigma Code when it was principally a British endeavor, particularly the decoding, but then, they don't make summer action flicks about gay British mathematicians; 2) the attack on the U.S. sub, so poorly shot and edited it's hard to tell who's killed and who survived (not helped by a cast of young actors who all look alike in their World War II haircuts).Best things about the picture:  1) Harvey Keitel, an acting god given the kind of dialogue Hollywood used to stick William Bendix with and, like the much underrated Bendix, he still makes it work (let's just hope nobody decides to star him in a big-screen version of ""The Life of Riley""; 2) Jack Noseworthy, who's developing the kind of eyes and cheekbones that stars are made of.  Noseworthy is dead-on in every scene as the German-American farm boy who's ashamed of his heritage.  Unfortunately, most fans are mistaking him for Jon Bon Jovi (who has a few scenes as an officer then vanishes without a trace during the big sub attack).  Hopefully Hollywood's casting directors won't make the same mistake.",U-571

A World War II film about U-boats and concentrating on naval battles from the writer/director of 1997's surprise thriller ""Breakdown"". But, oh yes there's a ""but"", the first trailer released billed it as a gung-ho action flick, which is what it really was.NINE GUYS STUCK IN HOSTILE WATERS...IN AN ENEMY VESSEL...WITH BIG MACHINE GUNS AND A LOT OF LUCK! That is all Jonathan Mostow's thriller offers besides no thrills. Unfortunately, the big finale wasn't that big. There was no real climax to the film, nothing on the edge of your seat because you know what is going to happen.THE PLOT. An American submarine is sent on a ""hush-hush"" Super secret mission to steal an enigma decoding machine from a stranded German U-boat which is floating in dismal waters waiting for a re-supply sub. The American sub is disguised as the re-supply sub to give them just enough time to take the U-boat by force. A small platoon of men is sent to overpower the sub. Well, unfortunately, the men onboard the U-boat lose their ride home and have to commandeer the vehicle for now. Well just follow this for a bit and don't include any excitement and that is what this dull action war thriller is all about.I figured with a great director and an impressive cast including Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey, and, of course, Jon Bon Jovi, I expected a lot more than even the face value trailer had to offer.All in all, an action/thriller that leaves the viewer cold and alone in the water.6/10",U-571

As for 'U-571' - If you honestly want to see a submarine move, pick another ! This flick is far to clean shaven, scrubbed and streamlined to even remotely resemble real life and duty on a submarine, even under preent day conditions. Watch ""The Boat"" instead especially the director's cut, for an impression of 'life' on a submarine.As for historical 'accuraccy' - It has been mentioned before that the Polish, French and English secret services originally 'accquired' the Enigma machine during the thirties - and by '41 were regularly reading the U-boat dispatches ( with corresponding massive effect on the naval war) - rendering the basic premise of the movie void from the start......
As for the uninspired acting - actually nothing much was expected, so the disappointment was managable...... Stil, it might be fun watching it as a total no-brainer zoned out with a cask of beer. Then again, there are more memorable movies ! Leave it be",U-571

Vampires ... scrawny girls firing guns that are to big for them, beating the crap out of dudes three times their size. No slim, blood dripping off everything and nobody came out-of-the-closet. It was enjoyable!There is a plot!Although this did not have the 'strong' manly characters of old (except for Harvey Keitel, maybe) ... these folks got the 'job done'.I found the attention to detail good and allowed me to get immersed in the movie.This is not a chick flick!

Sure, some creative liberties were taken.  But I think the realism of the sub scenes is a testament to the submariners to whom the film is dedicated.  And if adding some drama allows the story of their real-life sacrifices to be shared by more people, so much the better.  U-571 is a blast.  Just remember to come up for air.",U-571

But, like other Hollywood films, it is loud, full of shaking camera shots, and more of a coaster ride than a film. There are a few quiet and well done scenes, but I strongly feel that I would have been lost if I had not already seen the director's cut of ""Das Boot"" in January.  That film sets up the sheer terror of war in a submarine.  It is long, grueling, and incredibly well done.  U-571, like many Hollywood blockbuster films is for the masses, sort of a watered down version of Wolfgang's masterpiece.  I do think this is a gutsier film than many that Hollywood gives us.  I don't feel it is a spoiler to say that some stars do die, this is not the ""everyone will survive and be a hero"" film.  But, the explosions and shaking cameras overwhelm the experience, not enough time spent in character development.  These are basic, cardboard characters, we've seen many of them before, and we are sure to see many again.  I gave it 6/10.",U-571

THEY JUST WOULDN'T LET THE U.S. NEAR IT! The United States Naval Cryptography division made a deal to share two of the 'Purple' machines they had built with the Brits in exchange for one of the TWO the British had, ONE captured by the POLES and sent to England while Britain and France watched Poland fall. The British reneged on the deal.  Sorry, Yank, but we jolly well DON'T care if you have one, not our chaps being sunk, and all that...And so an American destroyer team trained and trained for a special mission to force a U-Boat to the surface and capture it and the Enigma on board before the Germans could scuttle it.  DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR? Want some proof?  Go and see the U-505 in the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.  But, perhaps y'all'd rather whine and bad mouth the United States.  It does seem to be a popular hobby.   So, the U.S. had to go and get its own Enigma machine.  This is a fictionalized account of all that, and tremendously entertaining.  Under the circumstances, it's not something the Brits should be mentioning.  It's stuff like this that lets you see how far Europe IS falling. The movie is taut, well-directed, well-acted, reasonably accurate historically with modifications.  A lesson on the basic nature of military command is better put here than in many other movies.

Many comments I read say that the movie was too predictable, but I seriously was waiting on the edge of my seat to see the conclusion.

So I pose this question: Was Das Boot predictable? Any viewer would expect the noble crew to return home to Germany safely and without loss of their ship. Right? But it didn't happen that way, did it? In comparing these two films, is it fair to argue that U-571 was really predictable during the initial viewing?

But they don't have the sheer thrills that this film provides.The cast was quite good, and it was nice to see Harvey Keitel play a good guy for once.  Matthew M also gives a good bravado performance.  I'd want to be a member of his crew.One word of caution.  Do not see this in a theater with the best sound system around.

There is no ""based on a true story"" disclaimer at the beginning of the film, and at the end a postscript gives credit to the Brits who actually recovered the real Enigma device.But as a movie, ""U-571"" is plain weak.  While the acting is passable, the characters are shallow and one-dimensional.  I didn't care if they lived, died, sacrificed themselves for their shipmates or whimpered like cowards. The main ""action"" of the film is a redundant, almost endless series of depth-chargings, each louder and more obnoxious than the last.  There are no surprises and the climax is an unrealistic mish-mash of bad special effects and sappy heroism.Everyone should forget this flashy mess and go rent the minimalist yet riveting ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and marvel how great acting is always better than underwater explosions.",U-571

(spoilers)",8,27 April 2000,"I find it interesting that so many people have chosen to ""torpedo"" what is a solid, impressive work of historical fiction.  Yes, that's right, historical _fiction_.  Just like ""Guns of the Navaronne"" is fiction, just like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is fiction, just like the vast majority of war movies.  For what it was -- a submarine movie -- ""U-571"" was quite excellent.  Solid acting, casting, and sets backed up a drawing plot... would they get away? (Yes, we know that they will since it's an American movie, but ignore that for now.)  Would the capture of the submarine go through smoothly?  How close _is_ that depth charge going to come?I'd have to say the only disappointment I had with the film was the way that the German destroyer went down at the end of the film.  Regardless of how powerful a torpedo is, when it strikes the front of the ship there will not be a series of explosions going off in series throughout the length of the vessel.  The torpedo blows a hole in the hull, so that water pours in and the boat sinks... and fire is just an occasional side-effect.This isn't to say that torpedos can't be devastating -- one of the most memorable war clips I've ever seen showed a destroyer that was literally broken in half by a torpedo hit -- but simply that the overly-cinematic destroyer explosion at the end of the movie left me a bit dissatisfied.History-wise, ""U-571"" seemed quite reasonable.  It was set in 1942, the year after the original Enigma machine was captured by the British... and there's no way that the crew being sent to retrieve the code machine would have previously known of Enigma.  Remember, it was a tightly guarded secret, on both sides of the war.Overall, a solid, edge-of-your-seat war thriller.  My rating: 8/10.",U-571

As we all know it was the English, not the Americans who actually risked all to get the Enigma machine. What next, a film about how American troops saved the day at Stalingrad? As for the film itself, I found the action poor and unrealistic. For example the Germans were easily blown away by normally non-combative ""submariners"" as if they were stormtroopers from Star Wars.

So off they set in the World-War-I-era submarine with a single Germany-speaking crewman on board (surely the Navy wasn't that hard up for German speakers in 1942...). They reach the German sub, and start the voyage home.  Although this is not as claustrophobia-inducing as Das Boot, it was enough to make glad to be in a large theater -- when I could remember that's where I was.  U-571 will not be remembered as a great war movie in the vein of Patton or Saving Private Ryan, but it is content a good story well told.

Nothing else could possibly go wrong on board the Nazi Ship for our intrepid heros.  I don't think I could take another depth charge attack, which seemed to take up half the movie. I thought the most bogus part had to be the German's using ASDIC (sonar) which was a technology they (German's) didn't yet have equipped on Destroyers in 1941.

Her views do not reflect mine.  PLUS SPOILERS!I don't know what Hollywood has against Great Britain.  I don't see why they felt the need to make a joke about the British-Polish attempt and success of capturing an Enigma decoder from the crippled U-110.  I guess it is because they feel a movie depicting British heroes won't fare well in the US.  BUT AMERICANS AREN'T LIKE THAT!  The James Bond movies do better in America than in any other country!  Considering that in the post-Cold War ones that America was only mentioned several times, we can accept non-American heroes. Anyway, I couldn't care about this movie. We have some American guys who don't have any real names (Did They?) and no personality.  Since Britain is obviously so incompetent that they crippled under the blitzkrieg of London and let the Bismarck slip right through their butter fingers,Americans need to rescue the Brits.  In case you aren't aware of WWII, Churchill gave his ""We'll fight them in the streets and landing grounds to the last man"" speech during the heigh of London's firebombing. British Admiralty also coordinated the destruction of the super-battleship Bismarck, no help from us.   For Christ's sake, I half-expected to see Churchill about to be forced to walk the plank before Superman, errr, Uncle Sam lept to the rescue. Anyway, I didn't care anything about the characters, who either give new definition to ""paper cutout"" or strongly reinforce the existing one.  Eric Palladino, Dr. Dave from ER, exists only to get killed and look heroicly doing so.  The black guy was there only to appeal to minorities.  His most memorable line is ""Drop it you Nazi son of a b*tch!"".  Keitel did a good job, acting like another uninteresting person.  The only person I found interesting was Coonan, who suddenly disappears for no reason.  Oh yeah, that Wentz guy.  He could speak German, that's the only reason I remember him.  Oh yeah, and we have our favorite nudist playing the commander of this pathetic crew. The explosions (There are lots of them!) are first and so is sound. If you want to kill a few hours, I'd recommend this.  But for real heroism on the high seas, watch SINK THE BISMARCK or HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.

It feels like you are actually on U-571! It is the most realistic submarine movie yet made.  And with a solid script like this and the best acting I've seen in a long time, sound effects that are clearly the best of the year, you'll see what an excellent movie this is.

203,spencersb,Gripping depiction of submarine warfare.,7,7 May 2001,"U-571 is the semi-historical tale of the capturing of the Enigma Code Machine used by the Nazis during WWII.  Suspenseful throughout, though historically inaccurate.  Not sure just how much so, but enough to taint the movie (e.g. Enigma was captured by Britain, not USA; Nazi sub commander munches fresh fruit, a distinct rarity on board a sub that has been out of port more than a few days).  A little bit predictable in the plot. Submariners say that life on a sub is ""hours of sheer boredom, punctuated by minutes of sheer terror.""  This film depicts the terror well, but misses the boredom.  I know, I know, moviegoers don't want to see boredom, but it was (and is) a very real part of the story.  I like movies like this because we are quickly losing sight of how hard WWII was, and particularly, how close we came to losing it.  If not for the capture depicted in the movie, the war could have had a very different outcome.  Unfortunately, history belongs to those who write it, not those who make it.

Back to the movie itself. I've seen both Das Boot (German spoken with subtitles) and U-571. U-571 is the better entertaining film in my opinion. Das Boot has a very linear story, and apart from the same pumping music, it never becomes real exciting, more than that, it misses a compelling and gripping storyline. U-571 on the other hand has all the interesting and exciting elements you would expect from a submarine movie, including a very nice hunt sequence. If you want entertainment, go for U-571.

Technical and historical accuracy are sacrificed in the name of entertainment... so is any pretense of military discipline. It's an old-fashioned war movie in which the usual eclectic handful of Americans manage to beat the Axis villains (who have them out-gunned and outnumbered). If you're hungry for a mindless action-adventure movie, this is the fast-food ""meal"" to satisfy that need. If you want something substantial to digest, look elsewhere.Matthew McConaughey's performance is decent, and Harvey Keitel manages to look good even though he's playing a cinematic cliche -- as are most of the enlisted men. Jon Bon Jovi appears too briefly for me to say whether he deserves that cameo on ""the Sopranos"" that he so desperately craves.

Indeed the movie dedicates itself to the real life Allied heroes that actually captured the German code machine, even going so far as to give a list of the real live events in which the Allies deprived U-boats of their precious little Enigmas. The real life exploits would more then likely make for dull or clumsy cinema, hence we have this flick.The U-571 takes part in an underwater duel with another submarine, which was exciting, but nearly impossible for WWII submarines to do. Subbies back then had to see what they were shooting at in order to do any good. Made for a nice action sequence though.For all the above, U-571 is a fun and enjoyable film, loaded with non-stop action and suspense I spent most of my time on the edge of my seat, and the climactic confrontation was satisfying and spectacular.Pretty much any action or WW II fan should see this movie.",U-571
208,kfurnas,Sets this year's standard in suspense,8,22 April 2000,"There's no mistake that ""U-571"" is intended to be a suspense thriller - there is little dialogue and an huge emphasis on special effects and dramatic music.	And as a thriller, ""U-571"" is among the best in the category.	However, what puts ""U-571"" over the top is how intelligent it is when it tries to be more than a thriller. The movie is also a first-class drama, with superb acting, dialogue, plot and character development.	Set during a fictional naval mission from World War II, ""U-571"" tells the story of an American submarine crew sent to steal secret code information from the title Nazi submarine. However, during the mission, another Nazi submarine destroys the Americans' ship, leaving the crew stranded on an enemy ship in enemy territory.	The movie is able to accomplish a lot of difficult blending. Not only is it able to be both dramatic and action-packed, but it is also able to remain extremely detailed to naval lingo without being confusing to average viewers.	From an acting standpoint, the movie is a huge success. This is Matthew McConaughey's finest performance to date, and the supporting cast is equally superb. Few movies allow a character to be defined without words, but the view knows within the first minute McConaughey is on the screen exactly what his character is all about.	Harvey Keitel leads the list of co-stars, brilliantly portraying the ship's wise chief petty officer. Also terrific in the film is Jake Weber, who plays a suave operations commander who has to learn the ropes of being aboard a submarine.	All in all, there is nothing wrong with this movie. It perfectly gauges when to build tension, and when to relieve it. Its special effects are hardly noticeable because they fit in so seamlessly with the rest of the film. The sound is well distributed around the theater to give the viewer the feeling of actually being in the submarine. And the music is a masterpiece at setting moods of vulnerability, fear and triumph.	""U-571"" will undoubtedly be chastised for creating a piece of fiction about historical events. However, some of the most successful historical movies draw a tangent away from the history books into a completely fictional story (""Titanic,"" ""Saving Private Ryan""). ""U-571"" is no different.	This film deserves plenty of attention from viewers for what can only be called an achievement of action filmmaking.",U-571

The screenplay is fast paced with plenty of plot twists.  It will keep you interested for the whole movie.  I'm looking forward to seeing it again when it is on video.The story is interesting, but it is not a historical documentary by any means.  There are a few accurate points, such as American S Boats leaked like sieves.  It also dramatically represents that submarines were not a pleasant place to be when attacked by the enemy.I think the torpedo scenes were too much hyperbola and the depth charge scene was great, but the boat would have ended up in Davy Jone's locker with all those hits.  It is very exciting and great drama, but probably not technically accurate.I knew the history of the Enigma decoder before I went to see the movie.  I read about it in school and I later saw it on the History Channel.  So, I knew this movie wasn't factual.  I didn't expect it to be.Unfortunately, I overheard people walking out of the movie, making comments regarding ""U-571"" as a historical document.  I heard the same type of comments after ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Both were fictitious, but very entertaining.  Well worth the price of admission.My complaint with this movie is not with the writer/producer making entertaining fiction, but with the uninformed public who want to believe anything that Hollywood produces which resembles history must be accurate. Unfortunately, the real truth behind the history is often boring.  I don't think too many people would pay the admission to see a story of Bletchley Park and Enigma.  I'm thankful the British scientists broke the Enigma code, but I wouldn't pay to see the story dramatized.",U-571

Jonathan Mostow has done a good job at creating a respectable World War 2 submarine movie. The scenes on the bridge were as realistic as any other submarine film I have seen, truly giving you the sense of claustrophobia, especially during the depth charge sequences. The underwater shots of the submarines were surprisingly realistic, the way they reacted to the explosions around them was as if it was really happening, count me impressed.The true winners of this movie however were the main actors. Harvey Keitel and Matthew McConaughey were outstanding, they really controlled the screen whenever they were on. The supporting roles were all very good, convincing me at every turn that they were the characters they were portraying. The only disappointments when it came to the actors was that Jon Bon Jovi couldn't act and Bill Paxton was cruelly miscast, but fortunately their screentime was limited. The biggest error with the movie was the terrible score that did not fit it with the feel of the film at all. It made it feel comical at times instead of rousing. I know that a lot of people say that the history of the film is inaccurate because it was the British that got the Enigma encoder first but that doesn't bother me.

Not much though. This film's purpose is keeping you on the edge of your seat and it succeeds to the fullest.

Take a look at ""Apollo 13"" for example; almost all factual, and highly popular.   The sound was extremely intense, the action scenes were too phony.

An especially effective scene was when the Americans are unable to read any of the labels on the guages on the German sub.

First of all, how dare the Americans take credit for capturing the enigma machine. The British did it in 1941 BEFORE America EVEN ENTERED THE WAR! It was captured by British seamen who then took it to Britain where it was deciphered by a POLISH codebreaker. It would be like making a film that suggested that the British took Iwo Jima or that the French won the battle of Ghettysburg. The film does have descent acting but nothing special. Most of the characters are flat and boring. The plot is sub par (and not just for the fact that the U.S was nowhere in sight during that phase of the war). It fails to capture any suspense and is not a tribute but an insult to the seamen of both the Royal Navy and the American navy (why not show the U.S navy in a battle it actually fought and won, there are more than a few during the war that the U.S should be proud of).

Admiral Doenitz, suspicious that the UK had cracked the 3 code wheel Enigma (used by the German army), ordered a 4 wheel device & the British no longer were able to decode the U-Boat's messages. Sinkings of convoy vessels went up as a result, until a Royal Navy officer had the bright idea of knocking over a German weather ship in the North Sea & pinching the Enigna (they couldn't decode the messages from this ship so suspected, correctly, that it was a new, 4 wheel device). Code breaking recommenced & the U-Boats suffered such heavy losses that Doenitz eventually recalled them.In ""Operation Drumbeat"", where the US, now in the war, had the shipping of it's East coast targeted, the British supplied the US Navy with intercepts, giving the U-Boats locations, courses, speed & intended target areas. Also passed on were suggested tactics for dealing with the U-Boat threat, all learned the hard way & shown to be effective. The US East coast commander, Admiral King, IGNORED them!A bigoted Anglophobe, Admiral King refused to mount any anti submarine patrols & so condemed thousands of his own countrymen (the people he was supposed to PROTECT) to death. So many ships were sunk the U-Boat commanders called it ""The New Happy Times"".Contrast this with Canada, also the target of the U-Boats, where the UK supplied intelligence was used & the anti submarine tactics employed. So few were the sinkings of ships & so heavy the U-Boat losses they were withdrawn to the SAFER waters of the US coast!Only when Admiral King was finally replaced, after losses to shipping which could no longer be covered up, did effective anti submarine operations begin off the east coast of the US & the menace receded.One man's obstinacy, stupidity & wrecklessness sacrificed thousands of US lives to satisfy the cravings of his ego. No Hollywood studio is going to dramatise that, so crap like ""U571"" is churned out. This is even more shocking when you consider that the people who died in this shameful episode still have living relatives.The film Titanic was bad enough, but this is a step too far.I am appaled to think that if this carries on what the next step might be? How about the US wins the Vietnam War really? The US actually invented pennicillin (it was Dr Flemming, he was born in Darvel, just down the road from me)? The US wins the Battle of Britain?Hollywood needs a kick up the pants for this film. Sadly most will go & see it & believe it's true.

I'm sure you would feel a lot better!Things must be really, REALLY BAD in England if your entire sense of self-worth is wrapped up in rage over a Hollywood movie set more than 60 years ago. I know things haven't been too good for the United Kingdom since the bumbling appeasement of Adolph Hitler by your democratically elected Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain led to the loss of your colonial empire of unarmed third world countries, but you can't blame America for everything. Don't you have more important things to worry about than a fictional movie about a submarine, like whether it is time to replace David Cameron with someone who knows his ass from his elbow?Although the story of U-571 is fictional, there was, indeed, a war called World War II, and Americans did, indeed, capture a German sub with an Enigma machine, which doesn't mean that British sailors didn't capture one, too. Germany had lots of subs.Does anyone in Britain, Mexico, Denmark, etc., know what the term ""fiction"" means?If a movie is historically accurate it is called ""non-fiction,"" or sometimes a ""documentary"" or ""re-enactment."" A movie that is ""FICTION"" is, by definition, not historically accurate; it is about something THAT NEVER HAPPENED. U-571 doesn't claim to be true; it is fiction. There was no German U-571. Somebody made this story up; he is called a ""writer,"" for example, Stephen Ambrose. He gets paid to write screenplays that entertain us. A person who writes about history is called a ""historian."" He gets paid for not making things up, like David McCullough.Complaining that a fictional movie is not historically accurate is like complaining that pizza is not fried chicken. If you want pizza, order pizza, and don't go complaining to the restaurant after you get it that it's not fried chicken. Or to put it in more Anglo-friendly terms, if you want bangers and mash, don't order fish and chips!I suspect that a lot of the negative reviews are by people who didn't actually watch the movie, or at least didn't finish watching the movie. They are certainly by people who confuse current events with history, and because they don't like America's recent foreign policy and military actions, they criticize America over fictional movies about World War II. Makes sense to them. I'll bet these people, most likely children, know next to nothing about the real history of World War II. If they did, they wouldn't be confusing a Hollywood adventure film with historical fact.The British reviewers complain that they were the ones who captured and broke the Enigma machine code, and U-571 hurts their feelings because it shows Americans capturing an Enigma machine. If you bothered to read anything about the real history of the Enigma machine, you would know that Polish cryptographers were the first to crack the German Enigma code in 1932, and they presented a smuggled Enigma machine along with their code-breaking techniques to the British shortly before WWII started. If you want to know more about the true history of the Enigma machine and the actual historical capture of submarine Enigma machines, just watch the ending of U-571; it is in text just before the credits. Or try Wikipedia or the Encyclopaedia Britannica. One of the things you will learn is that the British and the Americans both recovered enigma machines from German subs, including U-505. Yes, Britain, there was more than one Enigma machine in the world. These incensed reviewers complain about U-571 not being historically accurate, but then they go making up a bunch of patriotic British bosh and posting it as historical fact, when actually they don't know what they're talking about. At least U-571 doesn't claim to be true, unlike these reviewers. As to the accusation that U-571 is a knock off of Das Boot, well, this must be so because they are both set aboard submarines in WWII and they both begin with farewell parties, though there do seem to be some minor differences, such as that Das Boot was about a German submarine crew, and U-571 was about an American submarine crew, and most of the crew of Das Boot die when they are bombarded by Allied planes.

This one doesn't fail in that, it is a good war movie with a good cast, fairly believable main story and good old submarine atmosphere. There is something about submarine movies which will always be appealing. The tension, the distance from the rest of the world, the fear which underlines every operation under water. All in all this movie had a good setting, what I referred in the title as ""the frame"". The final package is still far from impressive, it delivers too much action and too little subtlety. Some scenes are too excessive and far from real, like every scene where lots of bullets are fired inside the submarine. And the ending had too much of a cliché. But the main problem for me is the main character played by Matthew McConaughey. I feel it's an obvious miscast, he is too young and far too little imposing to be a convincing submarine captain. Of course, this is a part of the plot and it is intended, but I still feel the movie lacks the subtlety and seriousness because of it. Matthew is a good actor, but not for this type of role.",U-571

Unfortunately, ""U-571"" fails miserably on all three counts.  The culprits here are obvious plotting, mediocre acting, and pedestrian direction. The film has one legitimate surprise (no plot spoiler here), but it's way too easy to figure out the rest of the action before it happens.  Harvey Keitel fares the best of the cast, but he's stuck with the stereotypical role of the war-hardened chief petty officer. Matthew McConaughey shows no screen presence as the lieutenant who has to take command.  As for the direction, the film moved too slowly (especially at the beginning).

However, if there's any accuracy at all in this movie as to what life is like on a seaborne submarine, I should thank my lucky stars for this....Nominally, U-571 is about an American attempt to recover an ENIMGA cipher machine from a disabled German submarine. ENIGMA was used extensively by the Nazis to send secure communications to the various fronts (and even domestically), and the capture of such a device had the potential of shaving years off of a godawful war.Things don't go smoothly however, and the crew is soon fighting for its life. ENIGMA takes a back seat as the crew tries to escape in one piece in the middle of a war-ravaged ocean.I like this movie. The tension in some of the scenes (which I won't mention) was incredible, even more so than the early 80s movie ""Das Boot"". If you enjoyed that movie, you will enjoy this one (IMHO) even more.
The one nit I feel obligated to pick is the ending, which felt somewhat contrived.

230,barnyard,It Could Have Been So Much More,6,25 April 2000,"Here in Toronto, U-571 has been compared to ""Das Boot"", Wolfgang Peterson's pacifist take on WW2 submarine warfare. There is no comparison, despite the presence of the latter film's art director. This is a made for North America Action/Adventure with very little originality. Too bad, because I was really looking forward to this film. Detractors up here have also complained that Holywood has co-opted a partially Canadian story- the capture of a German Enigma coding machine. Heaven forbid that the US ever acknowledges that Canada has a contribution to world history! But I digress...Editing problems also spoil the film: the marine major, Jon Bon Jovi's character, and all the captured German submariners disappear without any narrative acknowledgement within the film. We do know courtesy of Mr. Bon Jovi that his character's demise was edited out to preserve the PG-13 rating in US theatres. Presumably that is what happened to the rest as well. All in the name of cranking up the action quotient. ""Das Boot"" spends considerable time dealving into the characters on the U-Boat. U-571 creates one superficial character arc for Matthew McConnahy, then devotes the rest of the film to one submarine cliche after another. I took the liberty of watching Tony Scott's ""Crimson Tide"" a few days ago: it too trots out the cliches, but because the film also layers character conflict and some social commentary, it actually succeeds.
Run superficial, run shallow, indeed!",U-571
231,Mojo-Jojo,at long last...,8,27 April 2000,"At long last Hollywood finally took a look at a submarine and said ""wait a minute, things are really cramped inside of a submarine."" I realize that it is 1941 (in the movie) but it actually seemed to me that they just might have gotten it right or close enough for government work. I won't comment on the acting. The only name worth mentioning is the wolf. Harvey Keitel was actually a surprise. I didn't expect to see him in a movie where he doesn't play an a-hole or a bad guy or a bad guy being portrayed by Tarentino as a good guy. As for the other ""big name star"". Better than his work in Contact. I will say that. There might actually be an actor somewhere in that guy. Anyway the action was good, the explosions were loud. The water effects were believable in the Hollywood movie sense. All in all worth the price of a matinee ticket.",U-571

234,trudy.keenan,Gripping Action,9,22 June 2000,"I am not particularly a fan of action movies or indeed ""war"" stories. However, I really enjoyed this movie and was gripped by the action throughout.  Although the story has led to some controversy in Britain, it should be pointed out that at the end of the movie, it is stated that it is a work of ""fiction"" and that the Royal Marines did carry out effective missions of this nature prior to the US being involved in the war and in similar events.  Perhaps it would have been more pertinent to place the story later in the war rather than the time period picked, but at the end of the day, the movie does not credit itself with representing an actual historical event, but is only a story based on events.  Personally, I found the story very interesting because I was not aware of such missions being undertaken during the War and whether it was the Royal Marines or the American Marines, to find out that such missions were undertaken is of interest in itself.Only one other criticism would be that the depth chargers fired at the submarine and that basically skimmed the surface of the sub, would have (I am told on good authority) detonated.What was intriguing in this movie, although it was presumably shot in something much larger than a submarine, was the feeling that all the action was taking in place in a confined space and I can only admire the directing and editing, which must have been a nightmare.All in all, if you are not an absolute historical fanatic, and like a good action story, and can live with the usual ""all works out in the finale"" Hollywood ending, this movie is enjoyable.A very slickly produced film, with a great cast of actors, dialogue and effects.",U-571

You sit and watch and are entertained by the eye candy. But for those who insist on looking up every skirt, and yanking every bra in search of padding, there will be an inevitable disappointment.Truth: U-571 is a good action movie... and a good war flick. It doesn't pretend to be anything that it is not and doesn't promise a cameo by Sir Winston Churchill.In Sum: An American sub crew is given a mission to reach a distressed German sub before a relief party can arrive. Along the way, there are a lot of things that bleed and go bang. Not unlike a real war but we all know it's just a movie and that in the end, it's all for our amusement.At least, most of us know that.I personally recommend this movie for those who enjoy war scenarios and close-quartered action sequences.",U-571
236,Falcador,Cliched and unrealistic representation of a great original sea story.,6,24 April 2000,"I must admit I liked the film as I was watching it, but looking back later, its very cliched. The XO passed over because of a lack of leadership, the Captain who just manages to push the XO through the personal development door, plus quite a few other co-incidences of the highest order.Plus it's was also unrealistic and unrepresentative. The original version had a British Corvette, not an American Submarine pull off the mission. Torpedos of that era were point and shoot weapons. The idea submarines would use them against submarines is like two people trying to shoot each other with pistols at fifty meters with blindfolds on. Any of those near misses with depth charges would have sunk a real submarine. While Condor reconnaissance aircraft could travel long distances they certainly couldn't be used to escort a german Destroyer alone in the Atlantic. And there were no Destoyers in the Atlantic, the german surface navy was impotently confined to local waters or the Meditterenean for the duration of the war, their escape routes effectively blocked by the geography of Scandinavian/Danish water and the Royal Navy, and by the narrow confines of the Gibralter Strait to the south. And submarines certainly didn't have radar in 1942.Those annoyances beside, if you can suspend disbelief, then the sound quality is excellent and it looks good and it dramatic enough.Otherwise, stay at home and rent 'Das Boot'.",U-571
237,olof.dellien-2,Lacking logic ruins good storyline,2,29 December 2000,"It's the middle of the war and the American navy launches a secret trojan horse operation to recover a German ciphering device. This submarine movie contains the mandatory elements of sink bombs, sonar beep excitement and going-below-the-maximum-depth. However, the glue in between these elements is lacking in strength. The beginning is promising, but some cliches (bad guys shoot their own to show audience they are evil etc) distract. As the story moves on, excitement fades as every problem is instantly fixed by turning the right valve in the hijacked enemy submarine - this move is executed at least 10 times as remedy for almost any problem, which makes the second part of the movie uninteresting. The major events later in the movie are somewhat ruined by the impossibility of them actually occurring during WWII. In a word, a below-average WWII movie with a good idea ruined by lots of bad logic.",U-571
238,perkeo,What history?,2,27 February 2005,"The greatest fault of this movie is not that it copies and rips off whole scenes from ""Das Boot"", but that it pretends to be somehow ""historical"". Forget about the Enigma machine for a moment, for me the last straw came when U-571 was being hunted down by ""the entire German Navy"", like the German navy had free roam of the seas or like it was a massive threat. Besides, in the movie the German Navy can't seem to shoot straight anyway, so why worry?. I would put this movie in the same category as ""Air Force One"" and ""Independence Day"", all of them are plain ""Hooray for us"" ego stroking movies, totally divorced from reality.",U-571
239,odysseus-6,I like history,1,1 May 2006,"I like history. I have a healthy respect for it, and genuine interest in the subject matter. The nauseating way that US film companies like to rewrite it to portray the US have having done everything that evere saved the world, and the jaw dropping way that certain section of the US citizenry lap this rubbish up with a spoon rather than crack a book open and get a good education beggars belief. The US did not get the enigma machine, the British did, and historically speaking, six months before this film is even set. How they did it would have made a genuinely engaging film, and judging by how many American actors long to strut their stuff on the London stage, I'm sure many would have been chomping at the bit to try out their foreign accents. No such luck here. Garbage.",U-571
240,quincymd,Not worth seeing,1,21 November 2014,"This ""movie"" is no worth seeing. Historical errors are the stars, Special Effects are ludicrous, and the acting of the cast is repulsive. Pistols with endless rounds of bullets, machine guns which only wound or kill the bad guys, commandos who board a German ship without knowing a word of German language, torpedoes that miss their targets. etc. This is not a movie about a historical fact, but only a low quality adaptation of a novel. It isn't even a comedy. It doesn't deserve the qualification of ""1"" but there is no possible way to give it a negative value. My advice: If this is the only movie to see, switch the TV off and grab a good book. At least the later is an environment-friendly attitude.",U-571
241,Smith568,Bad Bad Bad!,3,24 April 2000,"Aside from the somewhat tolerable acting, there is almost nothing good to say about this movie.  Other than that, everything else that is at all interesting in this film is pretty much a direct quote from either Das Boot or The Hunt For Red October - except much less convincing in the context of this totally ridiculous plot.  Basically, you get a grab bag of tight close up shots of sweaty faces and damp machinery intercut with the occasional crappy digital effect of something exploding. The action scenes consist of the jumbled jump cuts and random camera moves that have come to dominate modern action films.  The special effects are so cheesy that most of the audience I saw this film with was laughing when the Nazi ship gets blown up. While the main premise is kind of cool, the rampant and shameless historical IMPOSSIBILITIES that make up the plot points of this movie are totally repellant.  This film is bad, bad, bad, bad history!!!  It seems to me that this is a perfect example of how a foolish studio can push around a weak writer/director team to totally and utterly ruin a script that had, at it's heart, a good idea.  People who have a fetish for Nazi uniforms might get a slight kick, but aside from that there is absolutely ZERO romantic content in this film.  My expectations going into this movie were low, but this stinker breaks up so fast that I couldn't even find anything to hang on to. Stay away.",U-571
242,pgoggins,Banal,3,9 October 2000,"If the intent was to make a maritime follow-up to Saving Private Ryan, the producers of this film miscalculated in a big way.  Compared to SPR, U-571 loses in about every category.The writing was banal.  I didn't care when the men died.  With the possible exception of ""Trigger,"" they just died.  Mostow didn't give us the sense that these men had something to live for or that they died for something worthy dying for.The direction was uninspired.  During the standard (and by now trite) submarine-diving-below-specified-limits scene, the rivet popping and pipe bursting shots were no different than any of a hundred other submarine films.The acting was flat.  On this point, I will confess a predisposition against Matthew McConaughey.  I find his southern accent affected, and his delivery inappropriate to the character's situation.  Keitel and Paxton were better, but overall I sensed that there was a big casting problem among this ensemble: they didn't look or act like it was the 1940s.

243,finemot,"An enigma in search of Enigman: blub, blub, blub",5,7 October 2000,"""U-571,"" from writer-director Jonathan Mostow, takes on too much water, along with every submarine movie cliche. It's a great concept, gone under. Set in 1942, the film is intended as an homage to Allied sailors and their underground lookouts, seeking to end the stranglehold of German U-Boats on Atlantic shipping lanes. The Germans' trump card ins Enigma, a typewriter like encoding device, the solution to which has eluded the efforts of cryptanalysts. The secrecy of German coded ""traffic"" is thus preserved. Capture an Enigma device and you can change the face of the Battle of the Atlantic considerably. A German sub is crippled at sea and is attempting to rendezvous with another, loaded with replacement parts and mechanics. An American sub is enlisted to masquerade as this repair vessel, board the U-Boat and seize its Enigma machine. Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) commands the sub; and Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaghey) is the exec officer. Tyler has just become an unhappy camper because he didn't get his own command. Dahlgren did not recommend him, basically because, although he's a great submariner, he lacks the hard edge to demand the ultimate sacrifice of his men. Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel) is an old World War I vet. Then there's Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber), introduced by admiral as really being ""The man in charge ... what he wants, he gets."" Marine Major Coonan (David Keith), also answerable to Lt. Hirsch, will lead the ""boarding party."" Then there's Seaman Wentz, recruited by Hirsch because he's bi-lingual (German) ... educated at Brown no les Sounds okay, so far, even with the screwed up organization chart. Sadly, it's Dive! Dive1 Dive! from here on out. Seaman Wentz fears his crewmates will hate him if they learn he's part German; the obviously green American crew receives invisible commando training from Keith; we're expected to believe that German mechanics are incompetent (guess Director-writer Mostow never drove a Mercedes), and one German sailor is challenged by a black American sailor, ""Guess you never saw a black man before? Get used to it!"" (Nope, guess he missed the Berlin Olympics where Jesse Owens took Gold and twisted Hitler's shorts in a knot; also missed the two Joe Louis-Max Schmeling fights, too).    We're not picking nits here. We know the film is a composite of many events surrounding Enigma; but give us a break! Give us a sense of the time. Realize that the subs and the effects of submarine life and warfare on human combatants provide all the drama one needs.    Finally, is this a war tale or a coming of age movie?

But considering that it IS a movie about submarines, it would be hard to make a movie that you can sit through that contains submarines and no suspense.I'd say that overall, I'm just disgusted by movies that make Americans look like we all think that it's OK to say that a movie is based on reality, when it compiles different events into one story, and compiles different nation's soldiers (British, Australian, and US) into American soldiers.

249,mjcom99,Directed by a Naval Idiot,1,5 September 2016,"I'm not going into the main stuff wrong with this movie; see the many other reviews for that. Everything they say is true. But I'm going to hit some small but outrageously idiotic things.One is the ineffectiveness of depth charges. This movie is hardly unique in this, but it is very bad. Charges are shown exploding right next to the ship's hull, without destroying it. What do depth charges have to do to sink a sub, open a hatch and climb in? One that bothered me a lot was the part where the U-571 dives and passes under the German destroyer. The sub passes under while descending from 15 to 20 meters depth, and barely clears the destroyer's keel. How much water do these idiots think a WWII destroyer draws? 15 FEET would be more like it. 15 METERS would get you under a battleship! And there is one stupid thing that is not technical, but just shows an appalling lack of any feeling for the story environment. Preparing for the dangerous mission to board the enemy sub, our hero takes off his big class ring and places it on a shelf in his cabin. Now never mind that a sub in a combat zone is no place to wear a class ring in the first place. The thing is, he's shown pausing, gazing at his reflection in a mirror after he sets the ring down. It's supposed to be a poignant moment, as he thinks of duty and honor and 'will I measure up' and stuff. But watching, all I can think is 'what kind of idiot puts a thing on the edge of a shelf on a sub and expects it to stay there?' I think all this is not just nit-picking. It and much else go to this movie utterly failing, for me, to 'create and sustain its world.' And that pervasive failure is the mark of a very bad movie.",U-571

However, I like Matthew M. and Harvey K. a lot (Bill P. not so much) and I thought in my mind they propelled (mind the pun) movie a bit for me. Also, my opinions on a film are based on the complete experience - story. screenplay, acting, effects, sound, etc. I find the soundtrack was great and so were the sets, camera angles etc. This created an enjoyable experience in my opinion. It's funny to observe, but if you read ratings on this title from home theater buffs - everybody thinks this is a great movie. But critics such as those on this site hate it.

Destroying the DVD won't help, and selling it only passes this tripe onto someone else, who might possibly believe it. I might cut the disk into spikes and use them to burst the producers tyres or something, but really I am flummoxed re. what to do with this bilge.Fiction is one thing but attempting to re-write history is pretty sly and disgusting. Most non-American populations (Possibly unfairly) hate America anyway for their general self-glorifying attitudes, and self-righteousness, and a stunt like this does little to help.I eagerly await a film about the Americans destroying German dams in their B-17s using American designed bouncing bombs, or the Navy Seals destroying the guns at Navorone.

He imitates selected action sequences from Das Boot and The Hunt For Red October, but U-571 has none of the intelligence of those movies.

First, a soldier in the United State's WWII Navy. Second, a man, because just being a soldier wouldn't have gotten me on that sub with Matthew and his crew.  Matthew McConaughey does a great job as a seriously dramatic actor, once again.  He proves that a little bad publicity can't keep a good man down.  Harvey Keitel does a great job as McConaughey's second in charge.  Keitel's character hands confidence and wisdom to McConaughey's Tyler without stealing the show.  Harvey always does an incredible job at being a greatly understated supporting character.  Did anyone else recognize Erik Palladino of ER fame as the unlucky sailor who gets slugged by McConaughey and who later unwittingly creates the diversion that will save all of his pal's lives?  He does a great job doing what he has done so far on ER, be the voice of dissent.  The rest of the crew is made up of less note-worthy, but extremely recognizable young faces.  I was sad to see Jon Bon Jovi's character eliminated so early, I would pay the seven dollars just to watch him eat.  Unfortunately, in this picture he doesn't get to really prove himself as an actor, but if you take a look at his other films, he is one to keep close tabs on.  All in all I loved U-571.

Keitel, after reluctantly obeying McConaughey's order to sink to a super red-zone depth of 200 meters (I don't think she can take much more, cap'n), says, gratefully (and predictably), ""Those Germans really know how to build a boat."" Now if only those Americans (or those French, whichever B-movie producers did it) knew how to make movies like those Germans, too, they'd have known that casting Keitel in support of McConaughey, who starts to come apart at a meter-depth of about 20, would prove to be the real disaster.",U-571

A US Submarine is sent to capture the machine from a stricken U-Boat stranded in Mid-Atlantic.Bill Paxton as Captain Dahlgren and Matthew McConaughy as XO Tyler have a strained relationship due to Dahlgrens recommendation that Tyler should not be made captain of his own sub. Tyler has yet to learn that leadership comes at a price..... Harvey Keitel is the star of the movie as Chief. As usual Keitel manages the hold the movie together and it is his presence that adds class to the film.Bill Paxton gives a good performance but I felt Matthew McConaghys performance wooden, compared to the rather similar role played by Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan.In fact there area number of parallels between this film and ""Ryan"" although to reveal them would be a Spoiler.The special effects are great. I especially like the exterior underwater shots of the sub as it is depth charged. You actually see the hull being shaken apart and that . submarine looks very, very fragile.

259,blakes-4,On the edge...of your tolerance,4,7 November 2000,"In short terms: ""U-571"" is maybe the second worst war film of the 90s, worst being the vastly overrated ""Three Kings"". The acting is wooden, I'd say plastic at best. McConaughey is totally misplaced as captain and Keitel does one of his worst roles. Rest of the crew is just bunch of pretty boys with make-up dirt and sweat on their faces. Dialogue is ridiculous and so is the plot. You might ignore these issues by thinking it's ""just a semi-fictional WWII adventure flick and tries to be nothing more than that"" read more on why I couldn't just think so...This sub film was clearly marketed to the audience that was attracted to WWII movies by the excellent ""Saving Private Ryan"" and questionable ""Thin Red Line"" who haven't seen magnificent 1981 sub movie, ""Das Boot"". The director has taken plot from actual WWII event, the capturing of Enigma Coding machine, and reworked history to Hollywood standards. So the heroes have to be Americans and the cast consists of some hot young actors and even a pop star, who fancies acting. Young actors themselves can't handle the task so there has to be also an experienced father figure in secondary role, and Harvey Keitel fills that slot. But then of course, the crew can't be totally white, so there has to be a black crew member too so no-one could claim the movie to be racist, like the US Navy in fact was in WW2. But of course, this is a fictional WWII adventure film, so who cares about minor details?The first scenes look like direct rip-offs from ""Das Boot"", with Germans sinking British ship. The German sub suffers engine breakdown and some casualties in a depth charge attack. They are forced to surface, but don't mistakenly feel sympathy for their misfortune, since the same crew is later shown machine-gunning helpless lifeboat full of sailors in a senseless scene. It's only meaning is to prove they are fanatic nazis and deserve to die later in the movie.In Das Boot style there is the shore leave scene in the beginning showing US crew having fun in their cleanly-pressed uniforms in a dance hall. As they arrive to capture the coveted Enigma machine from the damaged Nazi Sub, none of the nazis recognizes the US sub even when it's vastly different than any German one. The heavily armed US crew then assaults the U-Boat in one of the most ridiculous gun fights since 50's B westerns: In addition being fanatic nazis the Germans can't even hit barn door from 5 feet.In one typical scene a german is lies on a bunk, hidden behind a curtain. His pistol is aiming directly at Matthew McConaughey (starring as US captain) when he opens the curtain. The German fires several shots at him from 2 feet but hits nothing and McConaughey kills him with a tommy gun. Then in one similiar scene a german is aiming at a small hatch where US boarding crew is coming. McConaughey jumps in and the German fires at him at about 5 feet but is instantly killed with a single burst of tommy gun.There are more of these scenes, but maybe you got the point. Then the US sub that brought the boarding party to U-Boat takes a hit from another german sub and explodes like a refinery hit by nuke.The skeleton crew easily learns how to ""drive"" the german U-Boat and knocks out the other german boat in a totally unrealistic underwater battle (they didn't have nice homing torpedoes or modern sonars in '41). Quite soon after that sole German survivor, the captain of U-571, tries to sabotage American efforts. He steals a pistol and when lone US crew member comes to investigate, the German captain shoots (and surprisingly hits!)him in the chest. But the sailor doesn't fall down, instead he stares at the captain, then his bleeding wound and makes mad dash with bare hands at the captain and knocks him on the floor...and rest of the crew restrain the nazi. At this point I was in major pains but I forced myself to watch.At the last half of the movie US crew meet a German destroyer while surfaced and pretend to be the real crew of U-571. At the last moment they shoot the German destroyer directly into radio room to prevent it from reporting their position. They manage to dive as germans just manage to scrape the boat's paing with machine guns. They dive under the destroyer's keel and the classic depth-charging and hull-screeching-pressure scene follows. The boat naturally takes some damage and is forced to surface, but no worries. As destroyer is chasing and firing the U-boat from few hundred feet hitting nothing but tuna fish, the americans use the rear torpedoes. KABOOM! German destroyer blows like it was loaded with V-2 Rockets and sinks in seconds.The damaged U-boat starts to fall to pieces and US crew is forced to abandon it. Happily they paddle into sunset with their small raft.For a moment I really hoped a German sub would surface and machine-gun them to the bottom.But the movie reaches The End and tries to give some credit to the British who in fact stole the Enigma coding machine and won the battle for Atlantic. Im not sure would they appreciate that they are even mentioned. I left the theater feeling great disbelief in future of war movies.Colditz with Bon Jovi....My Rating? 4/10, only because it is a about submarines!",U-571

Here, he has no chance. The movie starts slowly and never picks up steam. There is little if any character development (except MM's, which is also pretty thin), remarkably little action (just how many depth charges can one poor sub -- or audience -- withstand?), and all the sets look...well...like sets.

Yes, movies about the US single-handedly winning the war drive me crazy, but like I said it's just a movie. And I liked it: the movie was suspenseful and I enjoyed the performances of most of the cast. Matthew McConaughey was decent, and the supporting cast did a great job playing the cliches they were given to work with (though it was an effort trying to keep straight who was who). I especially liked Thomas Guiry as Trigger, but liking him made me nervous because I know the fate of guys like him in movies like this! Bill Paxton was wasted and didn't do much with what he had.

This is one of those movies that snatches your breath from you and returns it at the theater door on your way out.  The sound and visual effects in U-571 are astounding and frightening.  The camera angles and position give the effect of claustrophobia and tightness of the submarine.  Matthew McConaughey,  of course, is extremely good in this movie and undoubtedly pulls some of the scenes together.

265,mainstay,"""Das Boot Light"" at Best",2,22 April 2000,"(moot warning: this comment might reveal plot details on a predictable film)
U-571 was a disappointment, especially for a big fan of Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"". Basically, the plot is as ludicrous as it was fictional. It should serve as a warning to future directors never to make a one-sided propaganda 'war hero' movie ever again.Negatives: (1) The plot is entirely in terms of Good and Evil. The 'Nazis' who originally commanded the U-571 are shown in one scene mowing down a boatload of shipwrecked helpless people ONLY to establish that they are Bad and deserve to be massacred later on by the Americans. The Americans, on the other hand, are all heroic patriots who are willing (like Trigger) to die for their country. And like Spielberg's mistake ""Saving Private Ryan"", the one German who the Americans save is the film's Benedict Arnold figure. ""U-571"" very much resembles old WWII era propaganda films in that respect.(2) The plot is risible. In an early scene, the American sub is completely blown out of the water (twice) by one measly torpedo. And then there's the whole idea of 6-8 Americans mastering the control (passive sonar, engine room, etc) of an Unterseeboot, diving, shooting multiple torpedoes at and destroying another submarine without a skipper in a matter of minutes. THEN there's the scene where they pop up in front of the German destroyer and shoot a torpedo at it. Considering the destroyer is charging at the sub guns blazing its incredible that they survived long enough to get a shot off. Not only does the torpedo hit the oncoming frontal-profile destroyer, but it literally vaporizes the entire frickin' ship. The destroyer must have either been an oil tanker carrying liquid hydrogen in disguise or the U571 was equipped with nuclear torpedoes. In either case, I missed an important plot development.(3) In terms of technical artistry and approprietness, this film is really pathetic. The creaks and groans and pops that are so awesome in ""Das Boot"" don't start until the U571 goes below 200 meters. The director, who seems to just imitate Petersen's film (Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery aside), just doesn't capture the tense atmosphere and claustrophobia. The omnipresent, bland, vaguely patriotic theme music doesn't even come close to Klaus Doldinger's excellent soundtrack for ""Das Boot"".(4) Predictable. This goes along with (1); obviously the Good heroes don't die, they kill all the Bad Guys, and save the world etc.(5) Dedicating the film to the men who 'risked their lives' to get the Enigma machines is, bluntly, stupid. Most of the Enigma coders were not obtained in ludicrous commando raids (big surprise!), but usually were taken when a U-boot emergency surfaced and was intercepted by a BRITISH destroyer before the skipper destroyed the books and scuttled the ship.Positives: (1) Decent acting and cast.(2) Spectacular sfx, which, though not appropriate (ie. destroyer going up like the Hindenburg), are good eye candy. Technical aspect aside though, all the explosions just make the movie cheesy.In all, a pretty pathetic movie next to ""Das Boot"". The director shouldn't have even attempted it. For the viewer, only see it if you want to satisfy your curiosity.",U-571
266,taylor-27,Too noisy,6,26 April 2000,"It seems like that little boat gets hit with everything but never sinks. The depth charge sceens last too long.

267,Django44,"No 'Run Silent, Run Deep' but good nonetheless",6,10 July 2002,"Before you mouth explodes with criticisms, remember one thing: this film was not made to be a heavy, fact-reliant war account. It was made for pure entertainment, and it fulfills all its demands in that area. Forget the 'Americans winning the war' content (which Hollywood was releasing over 50 years ago in films like 'Objective, Burma) and the improbable shots of torpedo near misses, and view it as it should be viewed. The action scenes are good, and there is sufficient suspense to keep you awake. Its many inaccuracies weigh it down, but ignore them: this is not a film to be taken too seriously. It's no 'Run Silent, Run Deep', but I'd give it 7/10 anyway.",U-571
268,Dweeze,A Great World War II Movie,8,19 April 2000,"Historical accuracy aside (the British took the Enigma first in 1941), U-571 makes for one hell of an entertaining movie.  Jonathan Mostow has crafted a wonderful film out of a story that combines several events from WWII.  The men from a US Navy Submarine are commanded to board a German U-Boat, capture the Enigma (the coding device used to scramble German messages), and bring it back to the US.  But, as expected, problems arise.The film takes the atmosphere and tension from Das Boot and combines that with the action of terrific adventure films.  Most of the members of the cast give excellent performances, especially Harvey Keitel (as cool as ever).  The battle scenes are very well done and the special effects are magnificent.  The only thing this film lacks is a commanding score.  The music suits the film well in that it isn't obtrusive like the score from Mission to Mars. However, it doesn't leave you humming, which is what a good score should do.Overall, U-571 is a very well made submarine thriller.  The acting is good, the story is good, and the effects are great.  A better score would have been nice, but with a movie this gripping, the music is the last thing on your mind.",U-571
269,Mr. Movies,An unforgettable action classic,10,22 April 2000,"Sometimes in a theater, you become so wrapped up in the action, you feel that you are a part of the action. The suspense, the sound (oh, definitely the sound in this one) the level of reality in the characters, plot, etc. just pulls you right in to the story. And when you realize its just a movie, you sit back and smile to yourself. This happened to me several times in U-571. I mean, I actually felt the action. Director/writer Jonathan Mostow keeps the viewers pleased and on the edge of their seats throughout the film with this amazingly shot, beautifully choreographed and knock-you-dead (literally) sound effects with explosions, depth charges, machine guns, and more.After reading my review of The Hurricane, you can probably tell that inaccuracies have nothing to do with a movie being great, as well as it is still realistic. The only inaccuracy in this movie is that the soldiers were British, not Americans. Why this was changed, I don't know, but I don't really care either. It is still an amazing film. It was also brought to my attention that this particular event did not actually happen, but events like it did happen. So, I will agree with other critics on calling it a ""gripping piece of historical fiction.""A team of U.S. soldiers are sent on a special ops mission to sneak aboard a disabled German U-Boat, or submarine, to steal an encryption device that would give the Allies the edge they need to win the war. The U.S. soldiers must trick the Germans into believing that they are comrades and are to help the Germans, and soon kill them all, steal the Engima and get back to their ship, completing the mission. It doesn't quite turn out that way and what happens puts nine American sailors in the most unusual situation and in despair, not only of failing the mission, but losing their lives.
While the acting itself and the dialouge isn't particuarly memorable, the story and the events in the movie keep it alive and suspenseful. It isn't predictable, and when you think it is going to resolve, it doesn't. One piece of advice: If you don't mind sound being terribly loud, you'll love this. Obviously, I don't mind at all and I think the only way this movie should be viewed is with maximum, shaking-the-ground volume. Yes, my chair vibrated from the sound at times. But the sound is great. Sometimes sound is way too loud, and it just isn't right, but in this it is done very well.
The characters in the film are very likable and believeable. I particuarly enjoyed the chemistry between all of them, and how well they obviously worked together. The film is an adequete length, and one of the greatest action films of our time. It doesn't have very many slow scenes at all, and if it does they are there for a reason. To make the film real. Character developement is neccessary. What makes people totally loathe films starring Sylvester Stallone and Jean Claude Van Damme is that there is no character developement. Plenty of action, but no actual conflict and no where to go back to for reference. But in U-571, its not like this at all. We feel what the characters feel.This slightly edges out Rules of Engagement in being the greatest movie I have seen this year. I can sense this being at the top of the box office for some time. The PG-13, and not R, rating helps this out a bit. It is actually good to see a great PG-13 movie, as I have not in a while. Where this was very good, it had its share of flaws, but none very noticable. That's why I give this a sturdy  out of .",U-571

How can they do it in a uboat which is able to do little more than float ?Why is one single American portrayed as being more clever and skillful than an entire uboat filled with Germans ?Why are the characters in this movie so shallow, that you can predict what's going to happen to most of them ?I was left with a feeling like I had just been subjected to a couple of hours worth of really bad propaganda.",U-571
285,Witch Hazel,One of the best movies of late,10,14 January 2001,"U-571 is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years, if not ever.  When I first saw it, I hadn't intended to watch it at all.  I glimpsed a few moments, though, and couldn't leave.I've always loved World War II movies, and personally think that U-571 ranks up there with the best of them.  It was an action movie, but, unlike most, was not made just to be senselessly violent.  It told a definite story.  The production was remarkably well done.  The acting was very good, too, and the characters well developed.  They were honest, good, genuine people who you sympathized with.  If anyone of them died or got injured, you felt bad for them.  You missed them.  When they were sitting in the water, listening for the depth charges, you leaned forward in your chair, listening with them.  That is not a common trait of movies.The story kept you involved and on the edge of your seat.  There wasn't one moment I felt like I could leave, no matter how short, for fear I would miss something important.  The living conditions on a submarine seemed to be accurate, too.  Now, admittedly, it was the British, and not the Americans, who first captured the Enigma.  However, not once does U-571 claim that historically it was, in fact, the Americans.  They just wanted to tell the story of battles to capture Enigma equipment.  Maybe they felt that the movie's predominantly American audience would sympathize better with an American sub.  Besides, if they'd used a British submarine crew, people would just complain that their accents were too hard to understand. Believe me, I know.All in all, I would give this movie my highest recommendation.  If you want a documentary about exactly what happened in the war, go find one.

290,Prosinecki,Hollywood history,1,2 March 2002,"This is a review written by a specialist on the U-boat warfare:First off, I am pleased to say my worst fears were not realized. This movie is not a retelling of the capture of the Enigma machine from U-110 with Americans substituted for British. The only thing the historical incident and the movie have in common is that both include an Enigma machine and a U-boat.The basic premise of the movie is this: It is spring, 1942. (Although not stated explicitly in the movie, this coincides with the implementation of the 4-rotor Enigma machine and the subsequent intelligence blackout which proved quite inconvenient for the Allies.) Allied intelligence learns that a crippled U-boat is awaiting a rendez-vous with a supply submarine. An American World War I S-class submarine and its crew are disguised to resemble that supply submarine, with the goal of boarding the U-boat and seizing the Enigma. Naturally the operation does not go as smoothly as predicted. The American boarding party ends up trapped on the U-boat and must figure out how to get home with their prize.The special effects, including sound effects, are good, and there are lots of satisfying explosions and interesting underwater camera views. The plot is a bit predictable, and seems to owe a lot to many previous submarine movies, including Das Boot. There are a few technical issues that purists will notice; for example, American S-boats were not actually equipped with radar, an awful lot of bullets were sprayed around the interior of the U-boat without appearing to damage anything vital, and the plan to open the torpedo tubes at a depth of 200 meters seemed ill-advised, to say the least.One scene was disturbing, however. Early in the film, the U-boat comes upon a lifeboat full of British sailors. The U-boat commander orders his gunner to kill them all, because ""The Führer has ordered us not to pick up survivors."" It is disappointing to see the myth of U-boats executing occupants of lifeboats perpetuated yet again. The truth about the Laconia order is it did forbid picking up survivors but did not specify that they be shot, simply that they not be rescued or aided as well as the only case on record in World War II in which a U-boat purposely fired on survivors in the water.In general, this is a good action film. It's no Das Boot, but then I knew it wasn't going to be. For one thing, it lacks the emotional impact and suspense of Das Boot; also, the grim wartime mood that pervaded Das Boot is absent from this movie. In fact, for U-571 the World War II setting seems almost incidental, as the plot could be adjusted easily to fit any other twentieth century war, real or fictional, involving submarines.In sum, this is not really a World War II movie. It's a submarine movie with nonstop action and plenty of explosions.29 April, 2000: One more thing which needs to be mentioned. In an interview in the 23 April Washington Post, the director, Jonathan Mostow, states that the movie Das Boot was ""based on a lie"" because ""[...] it pretended that the captains and crews were submariners first, and only incidentally Nazis. They were dedicated Nazis; they had to be to fight that hard.""As anyone familiar with U-boat history knows, this is nonsense. It is well known that the U-boat arm was the least political of any of the German military branches in World War II. While some U-boat men were indeed confirmed Nazis, many were not. Men fight hard in every war, not for reasons of ideology, but for reasons of personal survival and out of a sense of duty and obligation to their group or unit. Mostow's opinion on this particular topic is just that - an opinion, apparently not founded on any knowledge of U-boat history or military psychology",U-571

What many viewers do not comment concerns the sub-plot involving the ruthless moral courage the executive officer had to demonstrate in order to have an opportunity to become a commander of a submarine.If you are only interested in absolute historical fact don't watch it -but if you want to be entertained by a great action movie by all means see this film.Oh yes - a couple of other points for the naysayers - there were dozens of recorded instances of German submariners machine gunning hapless sailors and civilians in the water - if you don't believe it just do some research involving the lesser war crime trials at Nuremberg as well as numerous other official documentaries on this subject. Secondly, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" - a great classic, was no where close to being historically accurate - yet there are very few scathing political comments on that film. Grow up historical anger mongers - just enjoy this film for what it is -  a solid adventure, well written, well directed, with good cinemaphotography.",U-571
292,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzx,Would that this were another Das Boot.,4,19 August 2009,"I admit it: this is not the worst movie I have ever seen. That said, I could write a fairly lengthy list of things that were not done quite right.Das Boot now sets the standard by which all WW2 submarine movies are judged. U-571 comes nowhere close, and the smug, self-congratulatory tone of the DVD extras makes the deficiencies of the movie even more difficult to bear.Even the title is a problem. There really was a U-571 (look here: http://uboat.net/boats/u571.htm). Could the author of this rather lame movie not have used a U-boat number without a real history.The side plot – The Executive Officer aspiring for promotion to Captain – is a serious drag on the movie. I think almost the entire white uniform party scene and all of the ensuing ""I'm bitter because I was passed over"" and ""You must behave like Captain if you want to be one"" bits could be removed – edited out – and the rest of the movie would perk up quite a bit.With hindsight, not a good use of two hours.",U-571

It's just 100 and something minutes to keep you on suspense with twists and turns, that's is the basic summary of a film. I love this film and it's definitely worth watching whether or not your a WWII buff. Also, it's a very action a suspense based film and that builds around it, turning it into something that you turn on thinking your not going to get through it but then getting through the whole film, whether or not you've seen it which is a feat that some films can't reach.",U-571

The movie is well paced, with never a dull moment. The characters are believable and not two dimensional. The growth of Matthew McConaughey's acting and depiction in the screenplayh from a novice to a champ is well crafted. The photography and editing are above the norm. The action is believable. I found myself in a semi-state of panic with every depth charge facing the crew. Unreal how an American sub sailing crew could take charge of a German u-boat on such short notice, but this is Hollywood and anything and everything is possible. A classy touch to the script is when a German prisoner taps on the u-boat's wall --""destroy me."" His sabotaging stunt is soon found out and done away with! I wondered how could the Americans understand the German message? Later I realized that the American radio tech who deciphered it, spoke German earlier in the film and could have easily deciphered the message.",U-571

But then again most war movies are like that, even ones that purport to be factual. I think a little tweaking with the title and script would make a difference in the way this movie is viewed. I do understand that some people are sensitive to the historical inaccuracy of how the Enigma machine was obtained. Perhaps if the script centered on something else it wouldn't disturb so many people. It really is a great action/war movie. The movie is somewhat predictable but has enough twist and turns in it to be entertaining. Das Boot its not but it is a good submarine tale. Like Das Boot you get that claustrophobic feel of a submarines and the shear terror of being depth charged. The character development was also pretty good. It was interesting to see the sailor's carry out orders that they felt would probably kill them. The characters were all very human. I just think this is a better movie than the many here who have given it such a poor review.",U-571

298,snoopie,"Lacks heart, but great action keeps this sub thriller afloat.",7,19 April 2000,"If you've seen a submarine action/thriller before, whether it be ""Hunt for Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" or any one of the countless others, you know we're not exactly sailing in uncharted waters.  ""U-571"" begs, borrows and steals from the best of the rest, but there is enough suspense and a few surprises to make this boat worth the ride.Matthew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton and a host of newcomers take sail to overtake a German submarine during WWll in an attempt to steal a precious telegraph device (a.k.a. ""Enigma""), which allows the Germans to communicate in a code the US simply can't crack.  How the Americans tapped into the communications between the sub and the German command seems to defy the premise (i.e. ""Enigma""), but we'll let that slide for the moment.  And that the soldiers look as though they were handpicked out of GQ magazine instead of boot camp... we can let that slide I guess.  And the historical fact that it was actually the British that sought the Enigma... well, we'll just have to let that slide too.  It's a movie... not a documentary.As with all the action pictures of this genre, explosions are a must... and ""U-571"" is no exception.  In fact, one must wonder if, after the umpteenth depth charge explosion, the film-makers were able to claim ""no fishes of any kind were injured in the making of this picture.""  At least we know what the cast ate for dinner.  Nevertheless, the special effects deliver... and with an 80 million plus budget, they had better.The acting and writing are adequate, although Harvey Keitel, usually in top form, delivers his lines as though he has just read the script for the first time.  I simply can't believe he agreed to utter lines like, ""I'd sail with you any day of the week.""  The plot, loosely based on a true story, surfs along with as many predictable devices as it does surprises, but I guess it would have been a work of pure fiction otherwise.But what I miss most from ""U-571"" is a strong emotional core. There are so many sailors running around that it's hard enough to remember all their names, never mind get to know who they are.  We know that they're handsome, skilled and afraid to die (yadda, yadda, yadda)... but who are they? ""U-571"" never submerges deep enough into the hearts and minds of it's occupants for us to find out.  And so, even though the action/suspense cup is more than half full, the emotional cup is more than half empty.What keeps this ship from sinking is the tight direction of Jonathan Mostow, who also wrote the script.  Mostow directed Kurt Russell in the less successful ""Breakdown"".  Mostow keeps the action flowing at a hundred knots per hour.  Relentless at times.  But you never feel irritatingly bombarded, as in films like ""Armageddon"".  Mostow knows how to walk that delicate line between action and suspense... even if we are all too aware of the safety net below.",U-571

If you've seen any of the trailers for this film, then you probably already know about what I'm writing about.  Otherwise, skip to the second paragraph.The acting and dialogue were SO bad throughout most of this film.  Bill Paxton is physically painful to watch.  I got to where I would pull my hat down over my eyes every time he came on screen.  In the scene where he ends up in the water it looks like he is standing on a platform.  The waves rise and fall around him.  On top of that he has to say the most ridiculous lines of the whole film.Once the movie finally gets going, there is no real plot or suspense. There were several times that my friends and I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the stupid things characters were saying.  Even my 19 year old brother, who really only needs a couple cool explosions to think a film is amazing, kept chuckling and groaning at the dialogue.  Every WW II movie I've ever seen is better than this, and almost every ""intense"" submarine situation has been done before.

There have been complaints of Americans distorting history to create a good story.I think it is extremely hypocritical of the English (yes, me) to take this stance as we have made plenty of films about WWII that have distorted the facts.For instance, I have never seen anyone of any colour at all in any English WWII films! There were plenty fighting the cause for the freedom of the whole planet. (the same could be said about US WWII films too)The one thing I would take note about in U-571 is that there was a token black man in the crew (shock, horror!). I thought that there was segregation of the whites and coloured throughout the war.I only learnt of people of colour fighting in WWII 10 years ago when I was 24! This monumental fact is not in any history books, it is not depicted in British and US films.So shut up, you whinging Brits. We've done the same and possibly worse!",U-571

303,Hanneth,"If you want to see a good Submarine movie, don't see this one.",2,29 April 2000,"If you want to see a good submarine movie, go rent or buy Das Boot.WARNING: SOME PARTS OF THIS REVIEW CONTAIN POSSIBLE SPOILERS!If you have any knowledge of World War II German submarines this movie will drive you up the wall.The submarine is not a World War II Submarine. The external shots of the sub show 3 main guns. The German Subs of that time only had 1 main gun. Also the sub is way to wide, German subs were made extremely narrow. This can seen really well in Das Boot (1981) where the sub is an exact replica of the original German Sub.The music was okay, but not very memorable. It did fit the film, but was not used very effectively. Now the folly was atrocious, nothing added more to the disbelief of the movie more than the folly. The most noticeable mistake was the depth charges sounded like land explosions and at other times like slamming doors. Explosions under water have a very distinct muffled sound which was completely missing.Since I'm on the matter of depth charges I should mention that U-517 would have been blown to shreds with how close those depth charges were exploding to the hull.Another unbelievable event was at the end when the torpedo blows up the destroyer. I'm sorry, 1 torpedo of that time could not cause the size of explosion that one torpedo did. Worse off, if you watched while it was exploding, where the torpedo supposedly hit, there was no hole in the hull even thought the rest of the ship was exploding. Obviously the model was blown up by people with no knowledge of how things explode since the explosions did not look to originate from where the torpedo hit.The machine gun fire in the sub was completely unrealistic, when bullets are fired inside something metal most of the bullets will ricochet inside of object, where others will stick in to the metal or rip through it. With the number of rounds fired in the ship at least one person would have been hit by their own fire, many of the gauges and pipes would also have been riddled with bullets. If the gun fire didn't get some of those gauges the grenade they dropped down in to it would of. As it was the whole taking of the sub didn't do any damage to it at all.Other things some people might find trivial were the misquoting of technical information such as safety sub depths, the unrealistic results of when the sub went down to 200 meters, the color of the German crew's skin was way to dark, and the bad German speech of the first submarine's crew. They were speaking the words right, but had North American accents.",U-571

Several of the actors (Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel, notably) gamely attempt to breathe life in to appallingly hackneyed material, but the go down amidst an avalanche of cliched implausibility.  Many scenes are so predictable and formulaic that you can predict them down to small details well in advance(Ohhh, the submarine HAS to go below its rated depth, doesn't it?  Time for small leaks, cracking gauges and a pipe bolt being shot across the cabin...) I am no military historian, but many things seemed wildly amiss.   In 1942, the German Navy had been largely reduced to commerce raiding and submarine warfare.  The idea of a German destroyer, improbably fitted out with hundreds of depth charges for serious anti-submarine warfare, prowling the north Atlantic, seemed quite a stretch.

There is no other way to say it, this movie is enjoyable to watch, but the entire cast seems like they are very nervous.  Every time you look at them they look as if they are afraid of doing something wrong.  Especially Harvey Keitel, who looks as if he was kept in a box without food or water until they pushed him in front of the camera and forced at gunpoint to spit out a few lines.  As me and my friends were watching this film, we were just waiting for Gene Hackman to pop out of one of the pipes and start barking orders at all of the crew.  How they ever managed to stay underwater so long in such a tight confined space, and not have a heart attack is a mystery to all of us.

I am very proud to be English/Scottish/and Irish American. The movie DOES give full credit to the HMS Bulldog and her crew, as well as all other British crews who captured Enigma Machines before we did. I certainly think that, in no way, shape, or form was there an intent at stealing the credit from the Royal Navy or the factual dates of British success would not have been put into the film. I am of a mind that, I don't care which Allied country captured the machine as long as one of us did. I also understand (and this IS FACTUAL), that not only were not all Nazis bad, but many hated Hitler and the Third Reich and were genuinely good men (just look at the attempts on the Fuhrers' life). There were U Boats in the Gulf of Mexico and true accounts of U Boat crews giving food and rations to crews of sunken vessels in rafts after sinking their ships. There were also accounts of Nazi sailors coming ashore on American Soil for food and entertainment, while in the Gulf. The bottom line is, the good guys (all allies and Germans who hated Hitler and the Third Reich) won, and freedom-loving people the world over have the veterans of all allied troops and their bravery, courage, and sacrifice to thank for our freedom today.",U-571
312,ArgonautV4,"The best submarine flick since ""Das Boot""",8,7 June 2001,"Nothing can or will ever measure up to ""Das Boot,"" but ""U-571"" comes pretty darn close. I've seen about two dozen submarine movies, but this is the first one to leave me with no fingernails. I can't help but scoff whenever some hypercritical so-and-so gripes about it being historically inaccurate. To appreciate the movie for what it really is, you need two things: an open mind and an utter lack of cynicism. I saw absolutely nothing--not a prop, not a line, not a premise--in that movie stating that this was the first attempt ever at capturing an Enigma machine. Remember the dedication at the end? May 9, 1941, the British took the Enigma for the first time. Now, almost every time such a machine was captured, the Nazis eventually got wise and CHANGED THE CODE. They kept on changing it and changing it, and the Allies kept having to try again. So, who says the Americans can't try again a year later, fictionally? They tried and succeeded factually with the U-505--a lot of people seem to be ignoring this.""U-571"" also has the best sound and underwater photography I have ever seen in two dozen submarine flicks; it deserves the Oscar it received for sound editing. When I first saw it in the theater, the sounds were edited so that certain sounds came out of certain speakers; for instance, if the crew heard a noise in the rear section of the boat, that noise came out of the speakers at the rear of the theater. WOW!! Together with the terrific photography, it was just like being inside the boat with the characters. All told, the sound effects in this movie are mind-boggling.This gets an 8.75 from me, the -1.25 due to pithy little things like mooring lines and diving alarm. Other submarine movies have gotten a lot more wrong than that. ""U-571"" is realistic, mostly well-acted, and wholly well-written--to fans of submarines and submarine movies like me, it's a treat and a half. And there wasn't much character development going on, so what? There was too much else going on without making the movie overlong. As I say, it's no ""Das Boot,"" but it sure follows that new standard. So, watch ""U-571"" with an open mind and no cynicism, and you won't even be able to go to the washroom till it's over.",U-571

I thought the casting, direction, story line, screenplay, and acting were all very, very good. I found the plot complex enough that I picked up on new things and learned more about the Enigma recovery missions each time I saw the film.

There is an endless list of ridiculous behavior of the characters (stripping them of any personality at all), technical stupidities or other moments of amazing idiocy. So what is left is some kind of aseptic fiction picture with a quite predictable story. O.k., if you like that  have fun. Apart from that I found at least TWO nice things to this movie:(1) the idea with the faked U-boat seems at least uncommon and quite interesting to me and (2) the view at the boat from below while evading exploding depth charges above is a really nice shot (if you forget about the fact, that you surely could see nothing at all in this depth by normal means).Er, well ... that's all about the positive points.",U-571

Matthew McConaughey and Harvey Keitel couldn't use their full potential, because their characters were too flat and where was Jon Bon Jovi. Another point of criticism is the lack of originality, a couple of scenes seemed to be stolen of U-571 greater German brother.

326,nicki875,Surprisingly entertaining,10,29 July 2000,"When I first saw ads for this film, I thought ""Oh Great, a crappy war movie about explosions.""  But, for some reason I decided to pay $5 and give it a shot.  To my surprise, I didn't waste my money.  The film was action-packed with twists, turns, and a great ensemble of actors who were not only good-looking, but talented as well.  Matthew McConaughey gave a superb performance as Lt. Andrew Tyler.  Bill Paxton (Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren) and Harvey Keitel (Chief Klough) were excellent as well, but that was really no big shocker.  The huge surprise of the whole film had to have been Jon Bon Jovi as Lt. Pete Emmett.  Who knew that a rocker could actually act? Other standouts include Jake Weber (Lt. Hirsh), T.C. Carson (Eddie), Jack Noseworthy (Wentz), Erik Palladino (Mazzola), and Tom Guiry (Trigger). Dave Power (Tank) also proved to have quite an acting ability in his film debut.
German soldier Wassner played by Thomas Kretshmann was one of the characters that proved how well this film was written.  Even though the audience is supposed to be against the Germans, these soldiers are not portrayed as evil beings with no humanity at all.  Wassner was portrayed as a brave soldier who fought for his country with all his might just like the American soldiers.  U-571 might have done a better job with that than Saving Private Ryan.  Don't write me if you disagree; it's just my opinion.I must say that I didn't care much for the ending of the film.  There wasn't much of a resolution.  The movie just kind of ended after two hours.  But, the rising actions that sucked the audience in completely made up for this ending.  Another minor problem was how certain characters look alike.  If you haven't seen this film yet, there are two characters you must be warned about, Trigger and Rabbit.  These are two completely different characters who look exactly alike (in submarine light anyway).  So, if you think McConaughey just feels like calling Trigger by the name Rabbit, think again. It's a different guy.  I guess Tom Guiry and Will Estes just have that similar cute, boyish look (according to me, a 15 year old girl).But, the movie is great and worth your five bucks so don't pass it up! You'll have a great two hours.",U-571

A submarine, particularly a crippled one, has only one real advantage: stealth. What was it doing on the surface when it was spotted by the Nazi recon plane?

Let's get one thing straight, in no way is this movie realistic.  For one thing, the whole mission is to board a crippled german sub that is stranded in the atlantic.  When their own sub gets destroyed, the americans are forced to pilot the german sub instead.  Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isnt this sub crippled?  Isn't this the whole point of the film?  Well, apparently, its only crippled for germans, because a skeleton crew of non-german speaking americans can decipher the controls and out-manuver german subs and destroyers alike while sailing home the whole time.But then again, this appears to be some sort of super submarine.  After all, it can withstand depth charges blowing up several meters from its hull all day.  Apparently, the only way for a depth charge to take out a sub is if someone aboard leaves a hatch open and it happens to drift into it. Beyond this, the sub can dive deeper than any sub of its time even when damaged.  And even beyond that, it has some sort of super-torpedo that can take out a ship with one hit.  In real life, this crew and their stolen sub would have died around 50 times over, but whoever wrote the film must have figured the audience was too stupid to know that and was somehow able to pass this piece of c**p off as a realistic WW2 Naval movie.  As for realism, it would be more credible if the sub had been sunk, and they had all simply swam home.",U-571

The action scenes are great and for a change the submarines don't look fake ( always given away by the fact film makers can never make a little water look like a lot, something about the way it moves ) and with the right sound system, you feel like it's you being depth charged.

Sadly it's not because I loved it, in fact quote the opposite.It wasn't a boring movie, my attention wasn't especially wandering. The fault lies mostly with the simplistic story telling. Some scenes were so blatantly exposition, and predictable to boot. Take, for example, a scene where a character explains how a submarine will implode when it goes too deep. Well, that's a no brainer. He takes an egg (yes, eggs are so common in an officer's barracks) and it's rather obvious that it's going to be crushed for dramatic effect. The sailors sit enthralled, as if they didn't know of such things as going too deep is a bad thing. And, as he predictably crushes the egg, one character jumps in fright. They were supposed to feel tension, but I certainly wasn't feeling any. It was then also plainly obvious that the crew themselves would be put in such peril later on... and sure enough, they were. This was by no means an isolated incident.The style of the movie was also unsatisfying. An early scene at a dock just looked like it had been constructed on a soundstage. And, when on the submarine, it was always felt too clean and brightly lit... I would expect a more gritty atmosphere. The movie's feel and ambience was never quite involving enough.Because of my complete lack of history knowledge, I didn't know what happened in the real events relating to this film. I didn't even know what happened in this film. So I can't debate the morals of whether it was accurate or not.

Liberals in Hollywood continuously rewrite history and expect us to believe their lefty propaganda as if it's scripture; remember the historically-inaccurate ""Inherit the Wind""? or, ""Bowling for Columbine""? Go ahead, you limousine-socialists, sip your tea with your pinkies extended and defame American culture. A good pro-American flick is a joy to behold.",U-571
368,Pvw,Quite entertaining,6,7 August 2002,"An American submarine crew sets out to capture a disabled German U-boat in order to steal the enigma coding machine away from it...With a plot starting like that, one knows what to expect: exaggerated bravery on the part of the Americans, treacherousness on the part of the Germans, lots of explosions, sadness over the death of a crew mate, heroical speeches in critical times, and a romance. Well, this movie contains most of the clichés of its genre, but it doesn't indulge into them too deeply. For starters, there isn't any love story !We are immediately thrown into the action, which more or less manages to sustain itself throughout the movie. There is one major subplot, about the captain who still needs to prove himself worthy to command a submarine. But of course he passes each test imposed upon his commanding abilities with great splendor, with the coaching of veteran Harvey Keitel.During their hazardous journey, the crew will encounter another German U-boat, a reconnaissance aircraft and a torpedo hunter, while they are at the same time hindered from the inside by a renegade German crew member from the first U-boat. The biggest merit of this movie is that all those events follow each other rapidly, without the tension being broken down by tedious discussions in between.A few scenes are annoying because of their simplistic portrayal of the good guys versus the bad guys. Throughout the movie it seems to be a scientific fact that anything which contains Germans can be blown to smithereens with one single, well-aimed shot. The U-boat in which the Americans flee, however, immediately receives some kind of Divine protection, effectively shielding it from torpedoes and tons of depth charges.And then there was this obligatory, but totally superfluous scene in which the Germans show how evil they really are. You probably know this cliché: in order to make it acceptable for the heroes of a movie to mercilessly slaughter the bad guys, the script writers always work in a scene in which the antagonists ruthlessly and without provocation murder a bunch of innocent and mostly unarmed people. In this case, the already damaged first U-boat encounters a lifeboat full of survivors from a sunken ship, who seek refuge on the submarine. Unfortunately, they hadn't taken into account the blood-lust of the screenplay authors...But all in all the pace of the action is quite fast, and doesn't give the viewer a lot of time to even get irritated at some clichés or inconsistencies. And Harvey Keitel keeps the acting on the level. So as an action movie I would rate this a 7/10, minus one for the seemingly unavoidable American patriotism: 6/10.",U-571
369,boatsman,Frightening,1,24 November 2002,"Although there's been hundreds of angry posts concerning the rewriting of history, I'm shocked that there's still many posts who comment this movie as superb warmovie. It's clear that these people know little or nothing about what happened a little bit more than half a decade ago.These days, when people (especially young people) rather watches TV, than picking up a book or a newspaper to learn something about the past and the present, moviemakers DO have a responsibility. I must say, that I'm deeply worried about people watching this movie will believe that it's what really happened. In a movie like this one, it's hard to separate facts from fiction if you don't know the true history in advance. This is why I have to give this movie a low score.Finally, Mostow's comment on Germans as not being portraited as the Nazi's they are, is just one of the most stupid and naive comments I've heard in this context. How anyone can judge an entire population just because of a lunatic like Hitler is beyond my mind.",U-571

I guess it could be my fascination for underwater vessels. When I rate a movie I often choose to rate it by its entertainment value. This movie entertained me a lot. It had good action, good suspense and good casting. So if you like naval war movies then I can recommend this one. However, if you're looking for a new Das Boot then you should keep looking, U-571 is more or less a pure action movie. If you're down with that then this is gonna work for you.

At least the British Royal Navy was honorably mentioned for capturing the first enigma at the end credits. It has some good actors in it. Good action. Very suspenseful when the U-Boat dives to 200 meters. Gives me chills. Yes, there was some cliche and corny saying and elements in the movie. And how does a torpedo completely destroy a German destroyer lol. Why didn't the Germans just lock the hatch when th Americans were boarding them? Where did the american destroyer go when the U-Boat surfaced??????? Just stuff like that irritates me. All in all though, fun movie to watch.

376,vjmamm,this film belongs below crush depth,2,6 April 2007,"Background: I am a very patriotic American that loves our military, so I know that the true stories of heroism and duty by our forces are insulted by this preposterous film. The story goes that a U-boat's mechanics were all killed by fire, so it drifts in the middle of the Atlantic long enough for the American navy to disguise one of its own subs AND for said sub to FIND the u-boat that has been drifting for days in the ocean. If that story doesn't strike you as stupid, then you don't know how hard it is to find a ship at sea. Many movies have bad science or illogical plots in order to make an artistic point, but this movie made no point. Actually, the story was about an American officer who wasn't tough enough to be captain, and the entire impossible set of events was to set up the drama of the (SPOILER!!!!) officer sending a sailor to his death in order to save the ship. But this point was so far in the background and was so poorly executed as to be laughable. I mean the sailor was under one foot of water, somebody hand him a pipe to breath through.",U-571
377,rhandolph,Not as bad as I thought it might be..,5,12 February 2005,"I put this DVD back on the shelf as I had heard so much about its historical inaccuracy, and that it was another 'America saves the day! Yeee-ha!' effort, but went back in the spirit of 'Hey, it's only a film'.I enjoyed it, if they had skipped over the fact the US did not capture the first enigma machine or mislead viewers into thinking this film portrayed any sort of historical truth then I would have been annoyed, but the post-script at the end and interviews (for DVD viewers) make it clear what the truth of the matter was. Sadly a lot of the younger generation might choose to skip all this after the 'action' is all over. I had also heard many write ups say how poorly it compared to 'Das Boot' whilst ripping many scenes off.. well no, Das Boot does a far better job of instilling a sense of claustrophobia and the feel of being on a U boat (the lighting in U 571 is all abit even for instance and these no sense of crowding, foul air or depth) but most of the situations in U 571 were pretty unique to this film.If you have to see a U boat film, see Das Boot, if you've seen it and want an adventure film along those lines then U 571 is.. okay, especially if you get past the first 20 minutes.",U-571

Matthew McConaughey is OUTSTANDING as Lt. Andy Tyler, (a fellow Texan, and darned good looking!). As usual, he gives a RICH performance, as do Harvey Keitel, who is, as always, ALWAYS, OUTSTANDING, David Keith, who gives a solid, FINE performance, and Jon Bon Jovi, who is just all-around, SUPER (he should be in more movies, he's adorable!). The subject is an important historical lesson from WWII, the German ""Enigma"" machine. It doesn't matter who ""really"" retrieved the Enigma, the important point here is that the strong allied forces of the USA, GB, and many other countries worked together to make the operation a success. The movie is not about whether or not the Enigma was retrieved, but the way the missions were carried out. The ending is beautiful, really pretty scenery, and awesome camera work. My father was in the US Navy during WWII, and this movie makes me proud of him, and what he did, all over again. I say, ""10"" stars for this movie. Worth seeing again and again. It won't disappoint the patriotic American. It didn't disappoint me. It never bogs down, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat.

Nice explosions? Impressive visuals? Did you feel that they were in real danger? Or was there that little voice in your head that told you whatever situation our heroes got into, they'd find some way out and they'd all come home safe and sound? They had to- they're American. Second night: watch Das Boot. Also in surround sound. With the volume turned up real loud. And remember that this film was out way before U-571. Now tell me which one you enjoyed most.

The film was made in the USA to make money, not be a historically 100% accurate film about any Nazi U boat. As far as whether the US Navy ever captured a U boat, yes they did on June 4, 1944. They arrested the crew and got the enigma machine which was sent to Bletchley Park England. The boat U 505 was then towed the boat to Bermuda. It now sits in Chicago at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. The US under the Lend-Lease Program gave the United Kingdom $31.4 billion (equivalent to $427 billion today) during WW 2.

I consider this to be only slightly less amazing of a feat than the Seahawk's journey through a fifty-foot deep Pacific Ocean in Submarine Seahawk.This film is an American nationalist's wet dream.

384,davereiner,Fairly fun and suspenseful submarine movie,7,29 January 2007,"Submarine movies are a subclass of their own, and almost entirely male-specific. There are few female characters, those are very peripheral, and women tend not to like the movies. U-571 is a typically Hollywood but fairly entertaining submarine movie, with action, suspense, bravery, sacrifice and some psychological twists and moderate character development. Not a fantastic movie, but certainly entertaining and worth a rental.As for the fuss about it being historically inaccurate, my thinking is, c'mon people, it's Hollywood. Get a grip. They're not in the business of making documentaries, but rather they are trying to sell a product. This movie was made by an American studio, and they decided, and rightly I think, that the film would be much more profitable with American characters. So they altered history, like they almost always do when making movies based on a true story.People who know their history know of the remarkable heroism and tenacity of all of the British people in WWII, and especially their armed forces.

Matthew McConaughey is a good young actor and I enjoyed him in this movie. There was one scene in the movie that I had a hard time believing.(It involved questioning a Captains order in the heat of battle) There are several old sub or war movie cliche scenes but I ignored them as the movie was watchable.

The biggest problem I had with the film was that not enough attention was given to characterization (i.e., the characters are all pretty two-dimensional).  You won't care much when some of them die because you hardly had a chance to get to know them.As for the debate about historical inaccuracies, I'm not sure why the film-makers chose to use an American crew rather than (an historically accurate) British crew but I feel this inaccuracy was addressed at the end of the film with the historical brief which clearly stated that it was the British who retrieved the first Enigma code machine (and a couple others as well).

I can't remember the last ""serious"" movie that I have seen where the production staff has attempted to insert tension at the lack of believability.  There are also so many obvious set-ups, combined with the fact that this is a good guy vs bad guy movie that there was NO tension at all.

I guess for this movie to be 'based on a true story' the only requirement is that WWII actually took place.

British contributions to the war are an often overlooked by Hollywood and US History books. Enigma was a great British triumph and one of the top critical events of the war. The whole Wolfpack tracking effort was ingenious and British. I certainly appreciate the anger over this 'give the credit to the Americans' film especially from those who fought so bravely in the battles.That being said, the film was action packed, well acted and not completely unbelievable.My disappointments: One scene of a torpedo hit was ridiculously overdone.

I suppose that there were parts that were a bit suspenseful, but man, I just couldn't get past the acting, the music, the story, etc.  Bill Paxton (not Sir Laurence, but generally adequate) could have been a cardboard cutout.  Honestly, I think he might have been reading his lines from cue cards. Really. Watch for yourself.McConaghey should stay away from military roles, and what the heck was Jon Bon Jovi doing, anyway?

The truth is stated in a note at the end of the film, but it's mostly an afterthought.  That's just plain irresponsible filmmaking.That said, the movie was ok.  The plot and action were relatively entertaining, but overly melodramatic.Other people have commented on the quality of the music.  I didn't have any particular objection to the music itself (it was, like the rest of the film, rather melodramatic), but on the DVD we rented, the dramatic music in the combat scenes was often so loud that it drowned out the dialogue.  We ended up turning on the closed captioning so we could figure out what everyone said.I've seen better from Matthew McConaughey, better from Harvey Keitel, and better from Bill Paxton.  Heck, I've probably seen better from Jon Bon Jovi. I rented this movie with a free rental coupon so I could have something to watch while folding laundry.

Obviously the Nazis have never seen a sub movie before.  If they had they'd know certain things, like jettisoning a bunch of garbage always precedes a surprise attack.  Hell, I saw that one coming just by looking at the box.  At some point during the course of this movie (I don't know when; It took me three sittings to get through it) the daring Captain McConaughey will take the sub below the recommended maximum depth.  Why?  So the hull can creak and the pipes burst.  Why?  Because it's a sub movie, why not!Some things I learned by watching this film: 1.  Anything that breaks on a sub can and will be fixed in the nick of time. 2.  People in the military never salute each other or stand at attention. 3.  When facing an enemy destroyer with much greater firepower and whose crew thinks you're on their side, the first thing to do is attack them, because dammit, we're Americans!I haven't seen underwater action this believable since Bela Lugosi fought the octopus.  This movie would have been greatly improved by filming Harvey Keitel improvising dialogue in a bathtub.U-571 gets one star and that's for Bon Jovi.

Why is it necessary to demonize Germans in a Hollywood movie produced sixty years after the war? Do the Americans plan to make war on Germany? Or what the hell else might have been the producer's intention? Worst of all: the scene where the German crew machine-guns the helpless people in a boat.

For anyone interested, U110 (Commanded by LtCdr Lempe,  who sank the unarmed liner Athenia) attacked a convoy (OB318) which was outbound from Liverpool. She was blown to the surface by depthcharges from the Corvette HMS Aubretia. The crew, assuming she would sink, abandoned her. However, she did not sink at that time and a boarding party from the Destroyer HMS Bulldog, led by Sub Lt Balme recovered the Enigma cyper machine plus numerous accessories and code books.

Hollywood makes some excellent films! true. the responsibility to make a docudrama is a stern one. we are mixing up truth with fiction or 'hollywoodising' as one British director once said. docudrama is a document, re enactment of a historical event. regardless of how old or new the event. truth is far More amazing than fiction!",U-571

U-571 went on 11 patrols and was destroyed by depth-charges on 28 of January by an Allied-Aircraft.I think the film refers to U-570, which was captured by the allies, but in U-570, all documents an the enigma machine had been destroyed, when the boat was taken over.In reality, the enigma was captured from U-110.One last thing about the torpedo: In 1941 the Germans mainly used the TI, TII.

After being heavily bombed by a german destroyer, they are even able to reach an absolutely incredible depth.

Jonathan Mostow's ignorance is the main problem of this movie; he had his mind made up on what submarine warfare was like in ww2, and didn't see fit to base his opinions on historical facts. Having been a deciding factor in defeating the Nazi Germany, the US should be able to make pro-US movies about ww2 without resorting to historical distortions, inaccuracies, and blatant lies. U-571 is, from a historical accuracy point of view, as bad as it gets. As the History Channel reviewers wrote - they got one thing right: there were indeed German submarines in the Atlantic in ww2. Almost everything else is wrong, and not just the history, but the technical and tactical aspects as well. The impossible sinking of a German submarine in the beginning illustrates this point well. A US submarine disguised to look as a German boat (?! as welding some stuff on the conning tower would fool experienced sailors whose lives depend on the ability to recognize other ship classes from large distances. An S-class with a weld job conning tower looks like an S-class with a weird conning tower, not a type XIV German resupply sub) docks next to a German submarine pretending it's a resupply boat. They take over the ship by surprise. But they have a bit of bad luck as a real German resupply sub appears and torpedoes the US submarine. Really? At that time the Germans used type XIV resupply submarines, which were modified IXD's. They didn't have any torpedo tubes, so if this was a resupply boat how did it fire from a non-existent tube? Unless the Germans used a regular type IX to resupply the ship in haste.. but that doesn't make sense either - resupply subs would generally hold positions all over the Atlantic, so it would be a lot faster to just redirect a nearest type XIV already stationed in the Atlantic then send a type IX from Lorient or Brest. Anyway with the US sub sunk the surviving US crew on the captured German sub do an emergency dive, even if they have no idea how to operate the ship and every control is marked in German, a language most of the crew don't speak. Then somehow they magically obtain a firing solution on a submerged German submarine and torpedo it under water (an impossibility at the time). I won't even go into the facts that at the time this movie is supposedly happening the US wasn't even in the war, and the stealing of Enigma wasn't done by the US but by Polish operatives and later on the British.Skip this garbage and go watch ""Das Boot"" again, this movie isn't worth the medium it's recorded to.",U-571

But if Hollywood wants to make a movie about a significant contribution by the United States to stop the U-boat threat, they should make a movie about the capture of the U-505 by the USS Guadalcanal task force.The U-505 was a Type IXC U-boat dispatched to the Atlantic to sink merchant ships. One note in her history is that she was the most heavily damaged submarine to make it back into a safe port for repairs. But anyways, I digress. Captain Daniel V. Gallery, commander of the USS Guadalcanal, was ordered to sink any U-boats his carrier task force encountered. He had a different idea, however; to capture one, if possible. And so, to make a long story short, his efforts were successful in capturing the U-505, the first enemy man-of-war captured by the United States since the War of 1812.Correct my mistakes, all you history buffs out there(I wrote most of it from memory and left out the big details such as the actual events leading up to the capture) but if you don't know about the history of the U-505 I would definitely suggest reading into it.

445,niklasjbn,Why?,2,5 December 2003,"First of all, I have to say that I adore ""Das Boot"". Every sequence is wonderful, and even though it is more than 3 hours, it is never boring or unrealistic. I liked everyone in the crew, and almost started to believe that it had been better if the German had won the war.Then I saw this movie. I had heard before that it was a bad copy of ""Das Boot"", so I did not have high expectations when I saw it. But it surprised me, because it was even worse than I could ever imagine. It seems like if the director have looked at ""Das Boot"", taken the sequences from it and mixed them totally, skipped everything that does not contain action and found out a silly plot when he looked through the rest.From the very beginning and until the silly end I sat in my sofa hoping that these bloody Americans would get killed. Who can possibly believe that a crew who had never visited such subs before could handle it with such precision, and not only solve problems that the German crew could not solve but also destroy one German sub and one destroyer? *Sigh*.And why didn't they kill the German captain from the very beginning? Why didn't they guard their own sub when they stole the enigma in the beginning? Why are the persons in this movie only boring and annoying? Why was this movie ever made?At least I didn't feel anything for the American crew. I only felt hatred against that arrogant captain, and hoped that everyone would die as soon as possible. But I have learned my lesson. ""Das Boot"" is one of the best movies ever made, and looking at any other sub movies will only make me dissapointed... 1/10",U-571
446,bkiddus,More Hollywood drivel,1,21 October 2012,"Even if you took aside the historical inaccuracies in this film it would still be awful. Wooden acting across the board and poorly scripted.I would like to submit my idea for a film to the producers it describes how a crack division of American soldiers broke through German lines and relieved Stalingrad. Or how about in spring 1940 before Germany declared war on the US, a group of renegade US pilots fly to England and save the Brits from certain defeat by the Luftwaffe.America has huge amounts to be proud of in ww2, their bravery in the Pacific and heroic airmen in Europe actually deserve their bravery to be recorded with accuracy.",U-571
447,greenjr81,Love the hate.,10,23 December 2018,"I'm giving it 10/10 because so many are mad that a MOVIE was made with an American crew getting the German enigma instead of the Brits, who actually did. Get over it people, it's a movie. It's fiction, they never said it was a historical film. I don't give a damn about watching Brits since I'm an AMERICAN! Whiny snowflakes all buttsore.",U-571
448,brooks0502,Good Action Film,7,28 May 2005,"I know nothing about German WWII ships, Allied sub missions, and the recovery of Nazi encoding thing-a-magiggers. Call me naive, call me stupid, just don't call me ignorant when it comes to knowing a good action film when I see it. Forget about history, if I wanted a historical documentary, I would have watched one. This movie is about action, explosions, and submarine warfare. And I got plenty of it. I'm bothered at how many reviews bash this film for it's historical inaccuracy. I really didn't care. If your looking for action, adventure, and GREAT surround sound, watch this film. There are LOTS of films that don't depict history accurately, that are great films. You don't see five hundred bad reviews for Braveheart because thats not historically accurate. I have yet to read a review about Saving Private Ryan that argues the fact that there was no Private Ryan to actually save. And I'm pretty sure nobody ever complained that The Perfect Storm couldn't possibly be accurate, considering the entire crew died. This movie is good, no matter how you look at it. Enjoy it for what it's worth, and then go to you local library and learn all about U boats. Watch this movie with the volume LOUD, turn your sub UP, and watch the windows rattle at the depth charges. This movie will blow you out of your seat!",U-571
449,r-van-weers,Typically Hollywood,4,11 January 2005,"U-571 is a terrible film that everybody who values great movies like ""Das Boot"" from director Wolfgang Petersen should avoid watching. It is nothing more than an America-saves-the-world kind of movie which is overloaded with action and the typical Hollywood film music. It completely lacks historical objectivity and the characters are superficial hero's who have a difficult time showing realistic emotion.Let's put things in perspective here: An Enigma Code machine was never captured. Not by the British and certainly not by the Americans. In reality over a 1000 English scientists had been working for more than a year before they were able to crack the code. The movie is indeed full of twists and turns. In fact, the movie is so full of action that it can not be taken seriously. The scenes that were supposed to be the best scenes of the movie were nothing more than colorless copies of the most beautiful scenes of ""Das Boot"". But even in the proces of copying mistakes were made: depth bombs are exploding extremely close to the sub without causing much damage. The crew tries to look scared but there's no claustrophobia. Then there is this scene in which the American sailors have to dive with the German sub. They're all in a panic because they do not know how to operate the boat. First they state that there are no instructions on the machinery, then they claim that it's all written in German? All this takes about a minute and suddenly nothing seems so be a problem anymore?! In another scene they are confronted with a German destroyer that pops out of the sky and is easily defeated with one single gun hit in the radio hut. In reality German commanders as well as their crews were known and feared for their expertise. No German battleship would ever have been defeated so easily.All in all U-571 is a typical piece of Hollywood crap. Everything that makes ""Das Boot"" beautiful is missing in U-571. There's no great acting, there's no claustrophobia. So don't watch it, unless you are looking for a flick to fill up your time while you're eating popcorn.",U-571
450,m-matijas,Never left the cinema halfway through a film... This one made it happen!,1,30 September 2005,"OK, first of all let me say that I really love watching films and going to the cinema. But this one was a real pain in the ass. It was the first time in my life that I left the cinema halfway through a film! For all the guys out there who say: Oh come on it's not that bad. YES IT IS. Honestly nothing about this movie is worth a cent. Besides the fact that from it's historical accuracy you couldn't have been surprised if suddenly the Teletubbies would have been walking around there is nothing else in this piece of crap that could you make enjoy this movie. If you like sub movies do yourself a favor and watch Das Boot. It's by far the best sub movie out there and as it seems it will be the best for a while. If you want a little bit more action and it's not that important that the action takes place on a sub than watch Black Hawk Down. There are a lot good war movies and even a few brilliant ones out there. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this ridiculous piece of crap. 0/10",U-571
451,bmathias,The appropriation of the German Enigma Code machine in World War II.,8,30 May 2005,"As a person with a history of disliking war movies, this was a wonderful movie. For me it was somewhat slow at the beginning.The version without sub-titles would make the movie more intense, dark, realistic.The captions on the original gave appropriate credit to the Brits for attaining the Enigma Code machine. The R2 DVD version removed that credit. By doing so it implied the US seized the machine. History should not be implied or made vague. So many people don't have any clue about our history. They don't need this kind of ""help."" ""They"" are probably the same ones who wouldn't, or couldn't, read the credits anyway. But that's Hollywood.",U-571
452,mark-02092,Not a bad movie as many reviews suggest,6,20 September 2016,"I won't put this up there with the great war movies of the 40's and 50's. However, it was entertaining. Decent filmography coming before the era where everything has to be computer generated.Now, the acting was OK. Not what I would expect from Paxton. He was a bit dull. The short bit by Bon Jovi was amusing. McConaughy was actually pretty decent for this particular role.Don't watch this movie like its a documentary. Watch this movie for entertainment. It is not Saving Private Ryan, and it is not Das Boot. But that's OK. It was still worth watching.As for all of the reviewers complaining about this movie being a pro- American war movie? What do you expect? Its about WWII, and the Germans were the bad guys. That is Fact, not fiction. Depicting Germans as sub-human? I didn't see that in this movie, but that did kind of happen during WWII as well. (Trying to exterminate an entire race of people generally classifies as sub-human.)I would say that Hollywood typically puts out movies with the opposite perspective. CIA conspiracy, US Government cover-up, etc. How many more of those movies do we need? In fact, a typical plot-twist in this movie would have been that the Enigma device was actually given to the Germans by a pro-Hitler OSS faction within the US government. Its actually nice to see a movie from the straight-up patriotic rah, rah perspective once in a while instead.I don't normally write reviews very often, but most of the reviews that I read here did not reflect on the movie much at all. Just said it was terrible because it glorified Americans and bashed Germans. I didn't get that feeling, but many of these reviews did appear to be from those who may be trying to forget about the past. I don't think we should hold WWII against anyone descended from those who started it. However, we shouldn't exactly tiptoe around and pretend those things didn't happen. Remember it, learn from it, and we might not be doomed to repeat it.",U-571
453,iaboud,A propaganda movie 60 years late,2,5 March 2017,"This movie uses great effects and realistic settings, but the rest is fantastic superhuman nonsense. The U-571 was never captured by Americans and was sunk with all hands off the coast of Ireland by British aircraft, so I hope nobody gets his history from this. The Germans were furthermore quite humane when treating survivors in the sea, and while they could not take them on board, they rarely shot them all or deliberately killed them. The German navy commander Karl Dönitz was not found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. In fact, in 1942 the captain of U-156 tried to rescue survivors from a sunken British ship after radioing the allies, only to be attacked by American bombers which killed many of the survivors on the deck of the U-boat and forced it to dive, which killed the rest. The allies often killed German sailors who survived sunken U- boats or left them to die even when they could have saved them. This film is also short on realism. The German movie Das Boot was criticized by former U-boat sailors for its portrayal of depth charges being too close to the U-boat and not sinking it. Well, this movie had the depth charges a lot closer, the hull shaking like crazy, yet no rupture or major leaks occur. Depth charges don't have to hit the craft; they're designed to cause a crack or dent in the hull, and water pressure does the rest. Machine guns that fired from a German destroyer were enough to compromise the hull's integrity, but the boat still dives beyond its accepted limit after all that with no problems. The ability of a handful of men to operate a damaged foreign U-boat to achieve all these deeds and still survive to tell the tale is about as fantastic and unrealistic as you can get. It's a propaganda film with all its cheesy music, of pure good us versus pure evil them, and a pretty unconvincing one.",U-571
454,robvansenten,Blockbuster Galore,7,10 December 2005,"First off, I myself didn't like that although the story is based on true events it was an English submarine, not an American. Luckily there was not a lot of ""flagwaving"" and the main reason seems to be realism, American Actors should play American soldiers if possible. As Madonna has proved to the world; Americans aren't real good at acting British.Second, this movie is very decently made, it is the blockbuster version of the famous movie ""das Boot"" and captures the same situations which submarine crews faced in WWII. However, being a Blockbuster it has different strengths and weaknesses then that movie. In fact, this movie is a poster-child for blockbusters because it has everything a blockbuster should have: action, excitement, great special effects, decent acting all around, heroism and of course a decent storyline.Without spoiling the plot I can honestly say that there are some good plot-twists in this movie although some can be seen in advance. This however does not damage the storyline a bit. The acting, especially by the old dog Harvey Keitel is more then adequate and even the front-man of Jon Bon Jovi turns out to be a decent actor. The action Sequences in this movie cause great excitement as well as a sense of claustrophobia and panic. This is improved dramatically by surround sound. The cinematography (camera) is brilliant despite some minor mistakes, shots are taken from a wide variety of spectra such as the ""frogview"" which also adds to the feeling of claustrophobia.In conclusion I'd give this movie 7/10 because it is nothing more and nothing less then what a Blockbuster should be.",U-571
455,joneszaire,Annoying movie,2,21 June 2019,"The fact that a movie historically sucks does not necessarily mean its a bad movie (Gladiator for example), but U-571 is just that annoying 'we are the all cool Americans that fix everything'. Characters are flat and uninspiring. Stopped watching this movie after hat after half an hour.",U-571
456,psterna,50+ reviews! Can it be that bad?,7,1 January 2006,"I haven't seen it yet, except for a brief shot in a HT store to show off their Monitor Audio sub-woofer and speakers. (P.S. I own a set of Mission 78 series speakers, which sound 10x better than the M.A.'s, maybe they weren't broken in yet?) Anyway, I'm commenting on the reviews that were crying about the Americans portrayed as the one's who captured the Inigma machine, when the British did it. (first?) I took a look at the reviews for ""Sink the Bismark"", and noticed that no one (British) complained about the FACT that a U.S. PBY Catalina, flown by a U.S. pilot, discovered the Bismark after the British lost it. Historically inaccurate, yet a very good movie. So, when I do watch U-571, I will discount the FACT that it is inaccurate, and try to enjoy it for what it is, a fictional movie. I gave it a ""7"" now, but if I think it was as bad as it has been made out to be, I'll be back to give it 3 or less. God, can't you British give the Yank's some credit for saving your a$$? Why can't you even admit the Battle of Brittain was fought with pilots from many other countries against the Germans? Come on now, you can say it...T H A N K Y O U ! (was that so bad?)",U-571
