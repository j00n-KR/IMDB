0,SnoopyStyle,Rachel so much funnier than Rob,5,26 August 2015,"Jessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams) is a mean-girl cheerleader captain. She and her friends April (Anna Faris), Lulu (Alexandra Holden) and Keecia/Ling Ling (Maritza Murray) rule the school. Jessica steals a pair of ancient magical earrings. She drops one of the earrings which is picked up by ugly thief Clive (Rob Schneider). They both put on an earring and their bodies get switched. Jessica convinces her friends but struggles to figure out her new body.The movie lucked out by having Rachel McAdams as mean girl Jessica. It doesn't take full advantage of the unforeseen advantage. Rachel playing a man is hilarious. She's much funnier than Rob Schneider. Rob is doing his stupid idiocy which is fine. Rachel comes in and steals the movie every time. It's the disappointment of what this movie could have been.",The Hot Chick
1,Horst_In_Translation,"A good film, but also a missed opportunity",6,14 July 2017,"""The Hot Chick"" is an American English-language film from 2002, so this one has its 15th anniversary this year already. The writer and director is Tom Brady (not the famous athlete obviously) and for him, it is definitely the most known work of his career so far. This may also be the case for lead actor Rob Schneider, who is also a co-writer here and it is not the only occasion he worked together with Brady. Schneider certainly was a bigger star back then than he is today, but I believe he did a good job overall and he is certainly not less talented than the blockbuster comedy lead actors of the 2010s. This does not refer to Adam Sandler who I liked as well and who has a small cameo in here in two scenes. He's a good friend of Schneider and executive producer of this 105-minute movie. This duration includes the credits though, so it is almost 10 minutes shorter in fact. The good news is that the script and Schneider's performance are good enough for the film to never drag despite the fairly long runtime for a comedy movie. The female lead is played by Rachel McAdams, but she is really only lead in terms of the plot as she almost disappears completely around the 20-minute mark. Maybe the young Anna Faris has even more screen time than McAdams here. But this is no surprise because McAdams was not famous back then yet. It's telling that the credits state that this film is introducing her to audiences and this was still before her roles in very famous films like ""Mean Girls"" and ""The Notebook"". But this one here is still her breakthrough movie somehow and I must say that when she was on screen she was perhaps the best aspect of the film, not just because the title fits her very well.One of the biggest strengths of the film is that it basically never takes itself too seriously. Even in the more serious moments, it is all about character developments and they manage to make them look relatively light luckily. The film never tries to teach audiences something important and that's really perfect this way because otherwise the film could have gone wrong easily. But it succeeds. There are some pretty funny moments and the makers did a good job I believe in using the comedy to make people ignore some of the less realistic plot developments. Then again, it is all good as the core plot here about a crook changing bodies with a high school student is extremely absurd already. It is a parallel to a Lindsay Lohan movie, but not about mother and daughter this time and also not about lovers/spouses like in a recent German film where characters are switching bodies as well. So it is a bit of a new idea, especially for when the film was made. Of course, not all the comedy is working, but that is okay as it is no perfect film of course. Everybody will like or dislike certain scenes for subjective reasons. I personally disliked the fart humor scenes and I must say I was a bit disappointed Oscar nominee O'Keefe got such weak material here as his scenes are among the worst the film has to offer and he is a much better actor than he can show in here. But yeah, it's just subjective. Robert Davi (who plays one of my very favorite Bond villains) was wasted too unfortunately. But these are just minor letdowns. The biggest disappointment for me perhaps was that the focus after the body switch was 90% Schneider and 10% McAdams, maybe an even bigger gap and I would have loved to see a more balanced proportion. But like I said, McAdams wasn't a star yet back then, far away from the days of being the female lead on ""True Detective"" and an Oscar nominee, so it's not too uncommon. And storywise, it actually makes sense because the high school student's life is far more interesting and entertaining than the crook's probably relatively lonesome life that may have added too much seriousness to the film. So overall, they probably made the right decisions apart from wasting a couple really talented actors here. I recommend the watch and I believe this is one of the best comedies of 2002. Don't be fooled by the surprisingly low rating. It's a fun movie and has lots of guilty pleasure potential. Watch it!",The Hot Chick
2,claudio_carvalho,"Silly, Many Clichés and Scatological Jokes, But Also Very Funny",6,24 September 2004,"Jessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams) is a spoiled selfish cheerleader and her best friend is April Thomas (the delicious 'blonde' Anna Faris). Clive Maxtone (Rob Schneider) is a very small time crook. One day, Jessica steals a pair of magic earrings, which belonged to an Egyptian princess in the year 50 BC, from a weird store and in a gas station she loses one of them. Clive is robbing the place and finds the earring. When he wears it, their souls switch bodies. From this moment on, there are many clichés and scatological jokes, in a very funny movie. Indeed, it looks like a teenager version of ""Blake Edwards' Switch"". The look of the beautiful Anna Farris with dyed hair is wonderful. Rob Schneider is one of the funniest American actors, and he is also hilarious in the role of Jessica Spencer. The unknown Rachel McAdams is also very funny playing as Clive Maxtone. The DVD has many Extras and is another attraction. A good entertainment, indicated for laughing. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Garota Veneno' (literally translated by 'Poison Girl', but with the meaning of 'Hot Chick')",The Hot Chick
3,jboothmillard,The Hot Chick,5,6 January 2012,"I had heard the title of this film before, and I assumed because of the lead actor it was meant to be rated terrible, but I was surprised to see it had some positive things said, so I decided I had to see if I would find it funny. Basically Jessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams) is a popular and attractive high school student, with friends April (Scary Movie's Anna Faris), Keecia (Maritza Murray), and Lulu (Alexandra Holden), but she has low opinions of others, including overweight Hildenburg (Megan Kuhlmann) and goth like Eden (Sam Doumit), and she has her rivals, like Bianca (Maria-Elena Laas). One day the girls visit a mall and find a shop full of African stuff, and Jessica spots a pair of ancient earrings, the shop keeper cannot sell them to her though because of their high value, so she steals them. At the same time, small time criminal Clive Maxtone (Rob Schneider) is robbing a gas station, and in the process he is forced to pretend to be the attendant for the girls, and Jessica accidentally drops one of the earrings which he picks up, and back at home they both put one of the pair on their ear. The next morning, the curse put on the earrings has caused them to swap bodies, so Jessica has become Clive, and vice versa, and this comes at a bad time because Jessica (Schneider) is meant to take part in a cheerleaders competition and there is the prom. After convincing best friend April and the other who she is, and forced to show her new penis, they have to investigate why she has swapped bodies, and find a way to restore her, and in the meantime all she can do is try to be manly. They do eventually find out about the cursed earrings, and returning to the shop the shopkeeper explains how they work and that the only way to swap back again is to find the other one, or it will be permanent. Jessica lives with April in the meantime and manages to secure two manly jobs, and her own parents cleaner also trying to rekindle their relationship, and as the school janitor, and she spies on her boyfriend Billy (Mrs. Doubtfire's Matthew Lawrence) who loves her. She is also spying on April's boyfriend Jake (Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd's Eric Christian Olsen), who is having it off with another girl, and as time goes by April is falling in love with the new Jessica. As all this has been going Clive, inside Jessica's body, has been forced into buying period products, but he has been making money using the body he now owns to get away with a lot, making money off of men, seducing them in their cars, Billy included. After winning the cheer leading competition, it comes to the night of the prom, Jessica taking April, and she manages to seemingly convince Billy of her identity too, but he runs away in disgust and unwillingness to give into feelings he had before. Hildenburg sees Clive on the news, and all the girls go to a pole dancing club, where he has been Jessica's body to get high tips, and both earrings are recovered, and put on Jessica and Clive return to their rightful bodies. Jessica makes up with Billy and they share a true love kiss, Clive is arrested, but escapes, still wearing lingerie, and picked up by a homosexual bartender that as Jessica his body had seen before. Also starring Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Stan, Melora Hardin as Carol, Adam Sandler as Bongo playing shop assistant, Fay Hauser as Mrs. Thomas, Jodi Long as Korean Mother, Matt Weinerg as Booger, and Dick Gregory as Bathroom Attendant. Schneider is certainly what makes this film what it is, and he creates most of the laughs with his committed feminine side with girly mannerisms that make him look very camp, I admit they could have shown a bit more of McAdams being manly, but it doesn't matter much. The body swap concept is something I have seen numerous times, Freaky Friday is the obvious example, but this was probably the first time I'd seen man swap with woman, and it is done in a most amusing fashion that actually works, a fun comedy. Worth watching!",The Hot Chick
4,Quinoa1984,It's time to be scathing...,1,15 December 2002,"...at least for this sh*t.  I will admit I thought Deuce Bigalow was a very worthy comic effort from Rob Schneider, as he became a male gigolo in his first solo effort that worked cause he had a certain  odd charm and effort for laughs.  The Animal was funny as well, but signs of stupidity were clearly marked like urine over territory on the picture, and when it didn't spark laughs it sparked ludicrous-ness.  But now he has his latest transformation comedy, The Hot Chick, and I got to tell you, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, masterminds of South Park, had a great moment when they showed Schneider's next effort to be him transformed into a stapler, cause that can be certain where he's heading after this.A pair of magical earrings switch a popular, snotty girl into a man and a man into a girl (who in turn becomes a prostitute, which as a plot line is totally abandoned to stick with Rob, first mistake), then the film proceeds with a string of gags all attached to the high school/Prom/cheer-leading formulas, and not one of them is enough for just a grin; even having a Sandler cameo and Anna Faris, the Neve Campbell parody in the Scary Movie films, do nothing for redemption.  Only children, under ten years of age, with the mental outreach of Spam, and absolute Schneider die-hards, will find a smidgen of value in The Hot Chick, and anyone not wanting to waste over an hour and half of their lives should beware like it's small pox.

5,Boba_Fett1138,I'm still waiting for that movie in which Rob Schneider turns into a carrot.,5,15 August 2007,"""South Park"" once perfectly spoofed Rob Schneider's career, by putting fake trailers for movies, of which in one he turned into a carrot. An obvious reference to this movie. It showed how he and all of his movies were always the same and often relied on just one simple comedy aspect. This movie is like that. It relies on just one big comedy joke; a popular hot girl and a dirty dumb old criminal accidentally swap bodies.The humor and comedy is so simple and weak that at times you just can't help laughing at it. The sort of 'Austin Power's' effect, I would call it. So dumb, silly and predictable that it becomes hilarious at the same time . Such as the whole Biance plot line and rivalry, the story with the parents and so on. There really are some missed opportunities here and thats sort of weird since normally these type of movies are overfull with different often overly developed plot lines. Now everything remains mainly underdeveloped, which also doesn't make this the movie interesting or hilarious movie to watch. After a while the movie even starts to reuse some of its earlier jokes. Never a good sign when a comedy start to recycle its own jokes.Rob Schneider is mostly overacting obviously but I think that's also one of the reasons why the movie still works out as a fun one. I also think he did a fairly good job at playing a girl who's suddenly in a man's body. It provides the movie with some good moments, the one more subtle than the other. The movie also has some good supporting actors but in much too small roles such as Robert Davi and Rachel McAdams before her days of fame. Adam Sandler unfortunately makes a totally unfunny appearance in the movie. There are some potentially fun characters in the movie but those remain mostly underused.Of course the story also has some morals and messages in it. In my opinion it's a real shame that Hollywood comedies from this decade always feel the need to do this. But having said that, in this particular movie it isn't really distracting or anything but its still obviously present, especially toward the ending of course.Obviously not a lot of things really make sense into the story but this is not just due to the ridicules concept but also some bad writing. For instance it doesn't get explained exactly why the school-losers and outcasts suddenly teamed up and get accepted by the 'hot chicks'.In all fairness this is not a bad movie and it's certainly a watchable one. It's however also very simple, predictable and underdeveloped. That's why I just can't rate it any higher. But nevertheless I consider this a watchable movie. I guess it's especially hilarious with a couple of friends and A LOT of booze.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Hot Chick
6,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Kind of the opposite of ""you never know what you've got 'til you lose it"", isn't it?",6,10 November 2009,"A lot of people nowadays seem to believe that you have to go to extremes to be funny. And (I hope) most film-makers realize that there should be something beyond the immediate, superficial(unless you don't mind the flick being instantly forgettable). So I suppose I do sort of get why these, that attempt to mix the two, get made. However, it can be a tricky thing, getting the balance right. You've probably already figured out that this doesn't manage it. Maybe it's that Brady has not helmed a picture before, I don't know. I gotta say, his writing isn't that great, either(this and The Animal). For what it's worth, I think he means well enough. This does have some heart to it, if not as much as it wants to. Also, there are dramatic and engaging bits. It's uneven, and you find yourself as confused as the movie is, not certain if we should laugh or be affected. As far as the comedy goes, there are different types of material(and it's not all crude and nasty), leading to another problem; there's frankly too many quirks and stereotypes, and much of it does not pay off, on account of this being overly ""busy"". Variation is good, but a clear focus is vital. The ones that did not relate to the running theme would have been smart to cut. Logic is abandoned whenever the plot and/or a joke or gag require it to be. The editing could be tighter, a couple of shots last longer than they ought to, spoiling timing or straining credulity(and it's not exactly infinite to begin with, for this number). Acting is fairly solid, including the kid, he's pretty natural. Schneider can convince, as can Faris, though they do both have several of their worst moments in this, as well. The music is well-chosen and cool. There's eye candy for males in this. This has sexual stuff and mild to moderately strong language. The DVD comes with an entertaining and informative director's commentary, a handful or so of well-done featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending and a trailer. I recommend this to fans of those who put it together. If you just *gotta* watch a guy pretending to be a girl, and vice versa, go ahead. 6/10",The Hot Chick
7,view_and_review,Movie not hot,5,7 June 2007,"After having his genes spliced with animals, Rob Schneider goes a different route this time and has a body swap with a good looking high school girl. Well, if it was funny when he was part animal, then it should also be funny when he is a girl, right? Well, I think this plot idea has been tampered with one too many times. There have been plenty other movies in which a man plays a woman and vice versa, so what would distinguish this movie from others? I don't know, because it didn't do much to stand out as a good comedy. I think the director Tom Brady went to the well too many times with Schneider and that may be why we (or I) haven't seen anything from Brady since.",The Hot Chick
8,movieman_kev,"Better than ""The Animal"" at least",6,9 June 2005,"Jessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams from ""Mean Girls"") heists a pair of earrings from an tribal shop at the mall. After a run-in with another robber at a gas station (Rob Schneider), she loses one earring from the set. Turns out these jewelery pieces are magical and allow body-switching. We're dealing with a bad news/good news scenario here. the bad new being that the writer is the same responsible for ""The Animal"" travesty. The good news is this is considerably better. However, Anna Faris shouldn't make any more comedies, in every single comedy I've seen her in she is capable of a whole range of.. ONE expression, that would be being shocked/ Surprised, which would be fine if she didn't use it about 50 times per movie. But if gay stereotypes, fat jokes, and dick humor is your cup of tea By all means help yourself. You know what? I probably made it sound better than it is actually. It all honesty, this is merely an alright film even if it does feel a bit tame for a Schneider movie.DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Tom Brady; 15 Deleted scenes; 5 featurettes (Becoming Jessica, Becoming Clive, the Hot Chicks, Guest Speakers, and Physical Education); a ""Starlight"" Music Video by Zed; Trailer for ""Shanghai Knights"" My Grade: C+ My DVD extras Grade: B-",The Hot Chick
9,mm-39,"Hey, Better than average comedy, which is a hard thing to do",7,12 July 2003,"What is funny, that is a matter of opinion , and is harder to make than a action film.  A car blows up, and you got and action film, use TJ Hooker as an example.  Comedy, a guy slips on a banana and it could either be sad, or funny.  Much harder to do!  A friend at the post office wanted me to go to the comedy club on amateur night, I lost my nerve, like the banana one does not know if it is going be sad instead of funny and bomb.  Mr S in this movie could have easily bombed, it is hard to the hot chick, for a guy to pull this off shows talent.  Adam S had his influence with his over the top style.  Either you like this style or not, I find with that comedy, which I love, its material either ages well or dies.  Ie OJ type jokes.  The fight scene is a classic, but I found the father a little hard to take, but who's parents arn't.  In the end, if Political Correctness went its course the world would lose this luaghter, and levity.  What a shame, if the I just smelled poo loking face people with grudges decided what is funny, we never would be able poke fun at each other, and laugh with not at each other.

10,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Rob Schneider in women's clothing, he's going for that Oscar gold!",3,19 September 2010,"How to begin this review, the only thing I can tell you is that sometimes I want a brainless comedy. We all need those movies that don't require us to think but just to laugh and have a good time. Rob Schneider, how do I even describe this guy? He's this weird actor who can have an occasional laugh, a rare fun role but for the most part usually ends up failing when it comes to holding his own. Giving him a lead role, it just wasn't the right time. Not to mention that this movie was just not funny, I'm not sure how to describe why it's not funny, let's start with how the boys who created this movie get the middle east confused with Africa, sigh. I'm assuming that Abyssinian is a tribute to the Arabian Nights, but then later the magical earrings that put our characters into peril, are sold in an African store, mm, my head hurts. I tried to watch this with an open mind, but I guess when Happy Madison production is behind this, what should I expect? I guess I'll just explain this story to you.The film begins in an Abyssinian castle in 50 BC, where a princess uses a pair of enchanted earrings to escape an arranged marriage by swapping bodies with a slave girl. The rest of the film is set in the modern-day suburban hometown of Jessica Spencer, a popular high-school girl, and her friends April, Keecia, and Lulu . April is Jessica's best friend, and all four girls are cheerleaders. Jessica and her friends visit the local mall, where Jessica gets her rival Bianca into trouble and finds the earrings in an African-themed store. The earrings are not for sale, so Jessica steals them. Shortly afterward, a small-time criminal named Clive robs a nearby gas station. When Jessica and her friends stop there and mistake him for an employee, he services their car to avoid raising suspicion. Jessica accidentally drops one of the earrings on the ground, and Clive picks it up after the girls drive away. That evening, in their respective homes, Jessica and Clive put on their earrings. When they wake up the next morning, each of them is trapped in the other's body. This is especially difficult for Jessica, who has a cheering competition and the school prom coming up soon.See one of the problems I have here is that Jessica's friends pretty much accept that their friend is a guy now pretty easily. And how do they use this advantage? Let's look at his penis! Why? Because it's funny? Honestly, I think this movie must have been written by a teenage girl because I don't know who else could find it funny. The Hot Chick had actually a decent enough story where this could have been very funny story, it was just put in the wrong hands. Give or take, I had a couple of chuckles, I've seen much worse. I thought it was pretty funny that Jessica's boyfriend thinks that Rob Schneider is hitting on him. Her boyfriend was the only character who had the honest reaction I expected when you hear that your significant other is now the opposite sex and looks like another person, it's unbelievable. The Hot Chick just turns into a typical teen comedy that didn't work, Rob isn't funny enough to lead and the story of her/his best friend falling in love with her/him was just odd. I'll be fair though with the rating, I felt like I was at a friend's play and just can't be too harsh on something that was relatively harmless.3/10",The Hot Chick
11,=G=,This movie is awesome...,5,15 May 2003,"...if you're 16 and female.  ""The Hot Chick"" sets up a premise having to do with a punk dude who unexpectedly has his body switched with a hot chick via some hokey spell and then milks it and milks it and milks it.   Faris brings her perpetually vacuous persona from the ""Scary Movie"" movies and easily upstages protag Schneider who gets most of the attention as he struggles with the girl in the guy's body thing which never really clicks. The result is a critically panned doggie which is crude, silly, lively, lacking creative substance, and something only a teenager could love. (C)",The Hot Chick
12,MovieAddict2016,The Not-So-Hot Movie...,3,19 May 2003,"Some SpoilersTo set the record straight, I tend to overrate films from Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and the rest of the ""SNL""-gone-film crew. Why? I am not sure. Was I the only one who found ""Happy Gilmore"" hilarious? Apparently so. Am I the only one who thought ""Big Daddy"" was crude but had a heart at its core? It would appear so. But sometimes, on very rare occasions, the comedies just don't cut it for me. I thought ""Billy Madison"" was mediocre, with sporadically funny gags throughout.And I went into ex-""SNL""-comedian Rob Schneider's newest flick, ""The Hot Chick,"" expecting to give the film a ""3"" out of 5. Or at least a ""2.5."" But as the film proceeded, my expectations quickly dropped. Along with my final rating for the film.Filmed about ten years too late for its own good, ""The Hot Chick"" is your average comedy about body switcheroos, in honor of ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Vice Versa."" Actually, it's not your average comedy. It's a below-average comedy. To call it average is too high an honor.The film stars Rob Schneider as a dirty thief who finds a mysterious earring one day after a robbery. At home he tries it on (for purposes untold), to find himself switching bodies with the girl, named Jessica, who lost them, or, I should say, lost ""it,"" as she still holds the other earring. On her ear. Jessica stole them earlier that day from a store specializing in odd things, co-run by druggie Adam Sandler, who likes to tell people where you can hide ""weed."" Funny. Believe it or not, it's one of the only gags I laughed at. Not the weed gag. I laughed at Adam Sandler dressed up as a weirdo. Ha. Unbelievably funny.Not.The problem with ""The Hot Chick"" is that not only does it aim way below the belt for humor, but the humor is nonexistent. Even the one scene I laughed hard at was disgusting, in which Rob Schneider (who is really a woman inside a man at this point), takes lessons on how to urinate from an elderly black man in a restroom. The scene was quite amusing before they had to go into detail.Just when you think the film cannot dig any deeper below the belt, it manages to, and you feel like vomiting. But, as I said before, ""The Hot Chick"" has other problems, also.One of the problems is the missed comedy moments. So many things could have been poked fun of. Back-and-forth shots of Schneider in a woman's body and the woman in Schneider's body would have been funny, but we feel cheated as we are just shown Jessica in Schneider's body doing stupid, repetitive things in every scene. She's in the bedroom of her friend's house most of the movie. But I ask myself, how funny would it have been had Jessica, in a man's body, gone out and done tons of things. Sure, she does some things, like trying to get a free drink by doing something provocative for an employee - while she's in Schneider's body - but I felt most every joke was a lesser laugh than it could have been, and there should have been a lot more things overall that could have been done given the circumstances. Let's face it: Jessica's friend asking to see her friend's newly aquired...err...""you know what"" isn't funny the first time, much less the fourth time. It's stupid. But that's what we get throughout the film, instead of intelligent, witty jokes.And the characters! They're all cardboard-cut-outs, living in a fantasy world. The comedy doesn't have any real characters doing funny stuff; the things they say and do seem straight out of someone trying to entertain friends, not world-wide audiences. It's as if the characters are disconnected; just there to do crude things (like the romantic tension between a high school girl, who knew Jessica before she turned into Rob Schneider. The girl who knew Jessica before she transformed then falls in love with Schneider...who is really Jessica...and kisses him...or her...confused yet?). They're a bunch of disconnected, wandering jokes that aren't even funny.I can see how some of the things may have looked funny on paper, but the truth is, the script, co-written by Schneider, doesn't successfully make the transition from paper to film. Take, for instance, a scene where Rob Schneider's character is sprayed by pepper-spray in the face, and then proceeds to stumble down a set of stairs. Welcome to close ups of Schneider's face smacking the steps. And just when you think the gag - which was terrible in the first place - has been stretched to its limit, Schneider falls down another set of stairs. Unbelievable.I tried to be fair to this film. I really did. I sat down with an open mind, as I tend to enjoy these types of comedies. But what I got was a bunch of dull characters doing dull, unfunny things, that seem contrived from the beginning. Perhaps if there had been a bit more thought put into the script this film would have turned out funny, but instead, I left saying, ""This is soooooo ten years ago!""1.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",The Hot Chick

14,The-Sarkologist,An utter waste of time.,2,25 December 2011,"To put it simply, this movie was complete and utter rubbish. Yes, it did have a few amusing parts to it, but simply put, it was rubbish. It would be very tempting to simply end the review here, but I guess I have to outline it a bit more to point out why I consider it rubbish. I should note that for some very bizarre reason I watched this film a second time, but maybe it was so I could watch it again just to remind myself of how rubbish it actually it.The movie is about a young girl, Jessica, in her final year of highschool, who wakes up one morning to discover that she is a man. The movie then follows the apparently comical adventures that Jessica has as a man and her interrelations with her friends, particularly how she attempts to convince them that she is who she says she is. In a sense Jessica has an epiphany. At the beginning of the film she believes that her life is perfect, and for some reason (okay, there is a reason, and that is because she stole some earrings from some mystic shop) her perfect world is shattered because of this event.Half the problem with this film is that it takes an incredible amount of acting skill for a man to play a woman. This isn't a Mrs Doubtfire man playing a woman (or any number of Shakespearian plays where a woman plays a man) but it is a woman in a man's body, so being able to perform all of the little nuances of a woman, without actually going overboard, is difficult at best. However, any movie in which a man becomes a woman (or vice versa) is going to be a comedy, and is also going to be overboard.I can't really write about this film without writing about some aspects of homosexuality. This is where a lot of the laughs in the film come about, not that Jessica actually goes ahead with anything beyond kissing her best friend, but then again this is theoretically heterosexual, because she is a man, physically. However, particularly when they are in the nightclub trying to find a solution to Jessica's problems, it is clear that she is still speaking and acting as if she were a girl, which raises a few eyebrows, and of course there is the scene in the toilet where she attempts to work out how to use her waterworks.In the short run, this movie is one of those teenage highschool comedies with cheap sight gags and slapstick. It is not in-depth in its themes or its characterisations, and the characters are shallow at best. Granted, Jessica is forced to confront the fact that she annoys people with her belief that she is perfect, however it is a simply 'I'm sorry' and everybody is best friends again. At the end of this film I am left doubting that Jessica actually learnt anything from this entire affair, beyond being grateful that she is back in her old body again. Yes, she does come to learn about true friendship, and also that her boyfriend really does love her, as opposed to her best friend's boyfriend, who is little more than a jerk, but still, there really is, in the end, little to take home from this film.",The Hot Chick
15,UniqueParticle,Very entertaining silliness,9,4 June 2020,Unexpected mindlessness Rob Schneider really delivered on being awesome at playing a woman!

16,Floated2,Too many unfunny sexual and crude jokes,2,14 January 2011,"This film starts out pretty straight forward then turns for the worse. I didn't find the gags and jokes in the film funny just disgusting, crude and somewhat offensive in a way. Most of the ""jokes"" involve Rob Scheinder (as Rachel McAdams- female) trying to figure out how to get used to being a male. A lot of awkward and unfunny jokes are present, such as her using the bathroom, April (Anna Faris) asking to see her/his private, the stereotypical Asian friend's mother randomly coming in from nowhere, and other gay/lesbian jokes. This movie had a pretty good premise but given its's production and direction with script it wasn't as funny as it could have been. I think had it been rated R (incl. R rated material) this could have been a lot funnier. I understand what the filmmakers want us to laugh at. But the delivery doesn't work. Why do audience members laugh when Rob Schneider takes a header down about 100 steps? Not because there's any real humor in the situation, but because the filmmakers expect viewers to laugh, and we have been programmed to laugh, even if that laughter is more of a knee-jerk reaction than something that bubbles up from deep within.The whole plot who the transformation is ridiculous (even for a fantasy comedy). Jessica (McAdams) steals a pair of ancient earing's (she doesn't know they are ancient) from a shop, which somehow has powers to transform people who wear one piece of earning at the same time simultaneously. Also, the meeting between Clive and Jessica is rather ridiculous and pure coincidence. They meet when Clive is robing a gas station, and Jessica along with her friends are outside in their car waiting for assistance to help put gas in the vehicle. What I don't understand, is why would Clive go and help them. He simply could have said that he isn't the guy who works at the station.Also, they don't show Rachel McAdams (disguised as Clive)much in the film. She's there a few moments after the transformation but its only in little doses. The MPAA rates this PG-13. Yet it is too vulgar for anyone under 13, and too dumb for anyone over 13.",The Hot Chick
17,insomniac_rod,The typical Rob Schneider movie... is it something bad?,5,10 February 2008,"Rob Schneider has a unique style of comedy. Certainly it's not something bad because he is really funny when he tries. In this movie, he delivers expectations and delivers expectations with his well known raunchy comedic style.The plot is very dumb and predictable but that does not means it's something bad. No, in fact it's something interesting because you know what to expect but at the same time you can say you will be surprised.Rachael McAdams and Anna Faris are simply stunning, impressively hot and manage to deliver funny performance. To be honest, I decided to watch this movie when it aired on cable only because of the hot girls.I ended having a decent time with this regular comedy oriented for a younger audience.

19,FiendishDramaturgy,Typical asinine Rob Schneider fluff,4,28 September 2003,"I found this movie funny, but not witty. Entertaining, but not insightful. Watchable, but not memorable. While it is light years ahead of ""Animal,"" it lacks even the minimal charm of ""Deuce Bigalow."" Honestly, Adam Sandler's characters in this flick were much more enjoyable than the main plot of the movie.But, it is not so bad that I could not sit back and laugh at the fourth-grader jokes, childish idiotic dialog, and mid-teen stupidity of these 20-closing-in-on-thirty-something year olds playing teens.There is a plot, however obscure, but I won't bother with detailing it since it gets lost somewhere between Anna Faris's character, April, falling in...love???..with the ""Hot Chick""-turned-into-Rob Schneider who is NOT attractive on any level in the first place, and the mind boggling racial slurs later on in the movie. It is amusing, to see Rob Schneider prissing around like a teen aged girl. But only for the first 7 minutes or so. After that, it just gets tedious and boring.This movie is so conflicted. It's just lip-curling, stupid, mindless, teen-aged fluff. If you can find that entertaining, then by all means, indulge. Because it does make me laugh in spite of myself, it gets a 4.3/10 from...from the Fiend :.",The Hot Chick

This movie is directed by Tom Brady (The Comebacks) in his directorial debut and stars Rob Schneider (The Waterboy), Anna Faris (Scary Movie), Rachel McAdams (The Notebook), Angie Stone (Ride Along) and Robert Davi (Die Hard). The storyline for this is actually pretty creative, unique and well done. Schneider is awesome as the main character and his mannerisms, voice and body language throughout are excellent and hilarious. The circumstances are very clever and the storyline unfolds well. Even some of the subplots are creative, smarter than they get credit for and are well done. This is a fun film worth your time that I would score a 7.5/10.",The Hot Chick

The concept is undoubtedly unique and has lot's of potential to transform into a great laugh riot but the opportunity is wasted.The main problem is the cast as they were not able to portray the characters convincingly and stars like Schneider and McAdams looks irritating.

Despite the fact that's it's very funny, there aren't many raunchy things I can remember about it. Still, I enjoyed this film very much. When Clive (Rob Schneider) was eating nachos, I thought to myself, ""Oh, gross!"" However, when Jessica (Rachel McAdams) and Clive's bodies switched, I was reminded of a 2003 movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Rob Schneider scores big laughs here!"" Also, watch for a special appearance by Adam Sandler. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this wildly funny comedy that is raunchy at times to any Rob Schneider fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",The Hot Chick

Oh then there's McAdams and Faris and I love them both but... Yikes. This thing is a mess of a movie that's vaguely offensive and full of crass, lowest denominator humor. Admittedly, sometimes that stuff is a lot of fun but it just feels so off here. The one upside for me is the Sandler cameo. Him talking about all the things he can hide weed in cracks me up and it's become one of those little throw away lines I use all the time and no one ever knows what it's from and I love that.

25,aimless-46,A Pleasant Surprise,7,5 September 2005,"""The Hot Chick"" pretty much beats out its bad teen comedies competition and is a whole lot more subtle and cutting edge than ""Freaky Friday"". I don't find Rob Schneider particularly entertaining but as one of three main characters he does not feel compelled to carry the whole movie and his performance is reasonably restrained. I feel much the same about Adam Sandler but he is hilarious as the bongo playing ""you can put your weed in there"" salesman.The classic scene is when the mother falls on the family cat, complete with expected sound effects.Rachel McAdams and Anna Faris are excellent. McAdams ""Mean Girls"" performance was obviously not an accident and fortunately Faris can play someone besides Scary Movies' Cindy Campbell. Maria-Elena Laas is perfect as McAdams rival.What elevates ""The Hot Chick"" is one component of its mixed bag of humor. Although much of the scatological humor is moronic there is a whole lot of subtle underplayed stuff that is flat-out funny. For example: when the security guards arrest Bianca for shoplifting one of them says ""you are coming with us Winona"" and when McAdams is opening the box jewelry box the suspenseful music is being supplied by a stoned Sandler on the bongos.",The Hot Chick
26,rosscinema,Film wastes it's opportunities,4,23 June 2004,"For a film about a man and woman who switch bodies and made by two pretty funny guys I was expecting so much more but this film just squanders it's opportunities and plays it pretty safe. Story is about a pair of magical earrings that end up in the pocket of a pretty and popular high school senior named Jessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams) and when her and her friends stop at a gas station they meet a lowlife criminal named Clive Maxtone (Rob Schneider) and he ends up with one of the earrings. That night Jessica and Clive put their earring on and ""Ka-Zam""...they end up switching bodies.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****Clive/Jessica ends up as a hooker and a stripper but Jessica/Clive convinces her best friend April (Anna Faris) who she really is and they get him a job at their high school as a janitor as they try and figure out how to get things back to normal. Jessica/Clive enlists the help of some fellow students that she was not necessarily nice to but they end up helping her. She is in love with Billy (Matthew Lawrence) and tries to convince him of who she really is but Billy thinks he's just a gay janitor.This film is directed by Tom Brady who is making his debut as a director and he's known mainly for being a writer and a producer and the script is where the problems lie. For a film made by Adam Sandler's production company and co-written by Schneider you would think that the amount of jokes and comedic scenarios would be endless but for some damn reason this film just moves along at a pedestrian pace. Their are a few funny moments that take place but for the most part this film plays it extremely safe and when the switch-aroo takes place the female body Jessica practically disappears for most of the duration until the end when they switch back. I don't really expect much in the way of logic or intelligence in a film like this but even for a Sandler/Schneider collaboration this lacks the genuine humor of ""Deuce Bigalow:Male Gigolo"". Sandler himself makes his usual cameo but this film definitely needed more as the script lacks any creativity and the whole film seems devoid of any energy.",The Hot Chick
27,nycritic,Schneider As a Sight Gag,5,20 December 2005,"I have to hand it to Rob Schneider for ripping off much better films like BIG in order to coast through an easy 90 minute flick as a sight gag that in more ways than one is a thinly veiled homophobic tirade. In THE HOT CHICK, he isn't the title character at least -- that mention goes to Rachel MacAdams, who in a much smaller part, the Mean Girl who gets her just desserts when a freak event has her waking up as Schneider, steals the show in her introductory scenes. (And when that happens, you know someone either has more star power than you do and/or will eventually be the only person moviegoers remember. And anyone witnessing her rising status with films like THE NOTEBOOK, RED EYE, and THE FAMILY STONE will agree.)Anyhow, there isn't much to really review here, except that for an approximate hour and thirty minutes Jessica (Rob Schneider) has to find a way back into her body, or should I say his and represent her cheerleading team while also saving her own relationship with boyfriend Billy (Matthew Lawrence) and discover that she might be a little bit of a lesbian. Either way, it involves the other half of a set of earrings which Schneider body (inside Rachel MacAdams body) has. Complications ensue when Jessica as Schneider has to share intimate secrets with her own father, pass on as gay to her own parents, and endure countless humiliations involving a men's bathroom, but it's all in good faith because There Is A Moral To This Story. And it's that Mean Girls will wind up in the body of an ugly deadbeat with Seventies hair if they don't place nice.",The Hot Chick
28,raulfaust,Girl's not grey,7,5 April 2015,"""The Hot Chick"" is a film that used to be quite famous in Brazil, due to the number of times that its major television channel has displayed it. Last night I gave it a chance. As the movie started, I felt the story a little slow and uninteresting, but around 40 minutes of length or so, things started getting better and better. There are some indeed funny moments, like when Jessica has to go to men's room, or when that Corean mother tries using ghetto vocabulary-- I laughed out loud in that scene. One thing that impressed me is how strange Rob Schneider's character felt; I found it hard to say whether he was looking gay or crazy, given that some characters couldn't even see something strange about him. Anna Faris, on the other hand, doesn't do anything different from what she has done in the early 2000's, replaying the classic Cindy Campbell over and over again. However, what impressed me the most was the possible inspiration this film has been to comedies made shortly after. One example of this is the body changing thing, that surely gave some ideas to 2003's teenage classic ""Freaky Friday"". Also, men pretending to women appeared right away in 2004's ""White Chicks""-- not to mention the fact that the dancing scenes and the soundtrack in there looks A LOT like ""The Hot Chick""'s. Even if the story feels corny for most of the time, this film still manages to entertain and provoke some timid breakthrough in the genre, and that's why I will probably recommend it to anybody who asks about.",The Hot Chick
29,Chase_Witherspoon,"Ling Ling, you forgot your bling bling",8,30 April 2012,"Beat me with a rubber hose and call me a fool, but I think this Rob Schneider vehicle is his best, and an hilarious comedy to boot. It concerns thirty-something small time crook and general pervert (Schneider) inadvertently occupying the body of a senior high school queen and prima donna (McAdams) after he finds one of her earrings, an ancient relic transporting a centuries old curse. Soon thereafter he has to convince his BFF (Faris) that although he looks and sounds like Rob Schneider, he's actually a teenage girl inside.The script is the hero with so many great one-liners and set-ups, there's a guaranteed laugh in every scene. Robert Davi is somewhat wasted as Faris' pre-occupied father, and otherwise the cast is shallow, but Schneider and Faris in particular are very good. In between awkward moments that predictably revolve around discovering his (or her) manhood and now relative unkempt appearance, he moonlights as the Mexican gardener Taquito, working for his family while he tries to recover his female body (now living life as a criminal having taken Schneider's place).Plenty of site gags (there's an hilarious pillow fighting scene) and toilet humour (literally), well paced and hitched to a moralistic tale of true beauty being on the inside for those who like a message with their movie. Adam Sandler co-produces and has a cameo as a hooch smoking hippie (""you can store your weed in here"") and this in my opinion, is their most successful collaboration to date.",The Hot Chick

34,blott2319-1,This is not how you make a good bodyswap movie,4,11 October 2021,"I find that body-swapping movies can be quite fun and hilarious when done right. However, The Hot Chick was not done right at all. For starters, they make the character of Jessica too extreme of a Mean Girl. I suppose this is what got Rachel McAdams her role in the 2004 movie of the same name, but this time we need her to be a more redeemable character. It takes more than Rob Schneider can deliver in order to make us accept the fact that others learn to like her by the end. The second big problem is that they don't have enough of a character developed for Rob Schneider before the body swap and they never take the time to deepen him in any way. He is simply a scumbag crook who seems to have no qualms about doing anything he wants for a quick buck. This lack of depth in his character was a direct result of the greatest sin committed by The Hot Chick...There is no crime greater in this movie than the fact that they under-utilized Rachel McAdams. A good body swap shows how this has thrown off the lives of both characters, but we don't even see Rachel McAdams's face for the majority of the film. The brief glimpses we get are actually funnier and more effective than any of Scheider's attempts at playing a girl. My final complaint would be the way the film plays fast-and-loose with logic, to the point that there seems to be no consequences for some horrible things that were done by certain characters. I still have to give The Hot Chick a minor amount of credit. They don't delve too deep into some of the juvenile humor I expected, and it made me laugh out loud at least once or twice. Also, I thought the family story was charming, including how it showed that certain life choices don't need to be shamed.",The Hot Chick

This is much more than another cross-gender comedy, there are several real heart moments as the Jessica character, played more by Rob Schneider than Rachel McAdams, matures and the Clive role, done more by McAdams than Schneider, gets his due. Possibly the best Rob Schneider movie I've seen yet, I was impressed by his brief dramatic moments playing the personality of a girl trapped in his less than aesthetic body. Rachel McAdams will possibly be a big star regardless of her move, but it it is Anna Faris who really shines in this film. Adam Sandler also has a brief cameo. The only drawbacks to the plot are the contrived conveniences that allow the film to actually work, such as Clive would wear earrings, Anna and Rachel having that friendship rhyme, her friends believing her, the lack of the parents noticing, Rachel actually relocating her body and Clive doing the odd things while everyone things he's Rachel.

For example, in the movie, she taped a poster upside down. I do not find that it is funny. Anyone with a normal mental capability should be able to recognize what is up, what is down without even speaking the language.    That is the worst part about this movie.     Second, this movie also makes fun of other people's sufferings. From example, the Jessica in the male body had to roll down from several metal benches in a stadium.

The humor seemed a bit lame at places, but it had it's redeeming places. The whole 'ancient' background wasn't needed and the antics of each we were not all that great. First off, I'm not calling this a bad film. It was funny in places. But sadly, that is ALL it combines. Humor... Nothing more, nothing less. The acting was average at best and everything else was half of what I expected. So, unforgivably, the time lacked what ""The Animal"" had. It had heart and great humor to add.

The movie is about the most popular girl at High school who steals earrings that are cursed. This popular high school cheerleader turns into Rob Schneider and the mayhem and fun starts.

The movie looks like Britney Spears video (or movie) with none funny moments. And when you just thought that it couldn't get worse, wait till the corny end. I couldn't get rid of a feeling, that the only reason that Rob Schneider made this one, is to kiss with a hot Anna Faris. I have no doubts that the whole crew were having fun making this one, but sadly I didn't and that's why2 out of 10",The Hot Chick
49,duce122,Surprisingly funny,7,21 July 2003,"The Hot Chick (2002) D: Tom Brady. Rob Schneider, Anna Faris, Rachel McAdams, Matthew Lawrence, Eric Christian Olsen, Maritza Murray, Robert Davi. Schneider, for once, is hilarious in this low-brow comedy that isn't an Oscar winner, but also doesn't pretend to be. An attractive and popular teenage girl (McAdams) is cursed and transported into the body of an unattractive older man (Schneider) and must adapt. Some of the gags (the bar scene with the homophobic bartender) are mind-boggling with hilarity. Overall, the film was surprisingly funny, with a good performance by Faris as her best friend who accidentally falls for her (once she turns into a man). Ok just watch the film and you'll see what I mean. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for crude humor, sexual innuendoes, drug use, and profanity.",The Hot Chick
50,pri_e,good for laughs,7,24 January 2003,"When one walks into the movies to see this film, you can't expect oscar winning material. However in terms of humour, I found it to be hilarious!! Rob Schneider at first grossed me out with ""The Animal"" and wasn't really sure whether I wanted to see another movie of i=his but thankfully other movies of his made up for it.Overall I give it a 7 out of 10 for humour",The Hot Chick
51,pinokiyo,It was actually pretty funny!,7,25 March 2006,"People who hate this movie were probably in a really bad mood or offended, perhaps because the character in the movie being mocked portrayed them, or something... I don't know, but seriously, this movie isn't bad! I really had a good time watching this movie. It actually made me laugh quite a bit. Even though most scenes -- especially in this type of genre -- seemed forced, it still worked well. Rob Schneider really did a great job acting as a ""girl trapped in a guy's body""; as absurd as the concept sounds, he actually made it pretty believable. I also liked Anna Faris in this movie -- yeah, even though it was yet again, her typical ditsy blonde role, it worked. She made a lot of the scenes funnier, and she looked ""hot"" on the screen too (not a bias opinion, seriously).Now, I'm not the type who's always interested in these kinds of movies, but I was in one of those mood where I would give ""movies like this"" -- judging from the cover -- a chance. And well, I'm glad I watched it.This movie wasn't just about some guy acting like a girl and expect the audience to enjoy it -- it actually had a great story affecting other characters and family.I'm a bit surprised this was rated PG-13, since there's a lot of sexual references. So if you easily get offended hearing the word ""penis"" then this movie isn't for you. Obviously, this is not a movie to watch with a family! But a good laughter fun with your friends, or even watching it alone if you're old enough. Hey, this is also a great movie to watch after you see a scary horror movie and can't go to sleep! This movie should cheer you right back up.Great soundtrack too. One song in this movie sounded like a major rip off of Dave Matthews Band; I got a kick out of that. Don't stress over it, it's a fun movie! It's like an adult version of Freaky Friday, but funnier.",The Hot Chick
52,bbbl67,"good idea, could've done more with it though",5,21 May 2003,"Rob Schneider didn't do enough to act like a woman in a man's body.

Her friends join in the effort to find the secret of her transformation and to get her real self back too.

So there wasn't many surprises left.  My favorite scene would have to be the cheerleading competition. Cuz they hadn't shown THAT during the previews.Kudos to Rachel McAdams, who played Jessica. She did a great job ""switching over"" and I actually wanted to see MORE OF HER playing Rob Schneider, than the other way around. She was interesting.

There were some funny parts but nothing I found hilarious. It had a decent story-line but nothing that hadn't been done before. I thought the characters were funny and original and I especially like Rob Schneider's character. The fact that the characters were so different and they swapped bodies was a cool idea. Some bits were silly like when he pretended to be the Spanish gardener, I didn't get that. Other than that The Hot Chick is a film for cheap laughs and a girls-night-in- film.

62,Zingbot_9000,The Hot Flick!,9,2 January 2003,"BRAVO! Very Funny Movie.  Rob Schneider finally got it right.  Let me first say I have been a big Rob Schneider fan from his SNL days.  He is a really funny man.  I saw Duece Bigalow and thought it was ok, but thought he could do better.  Than I saw The Animal and gosh was I disappointed.  It in my opinion was an embarrassment.  With this movie I almost didn't see it because of Rob's track record of movies and because I noticed that Adam Sandler who is executive producer on Rob's and other SNL buddies movies usually saves the best for himself, but even Adam's movies have been disappointing lately.  Let me say that this is the best comedy I have seen in years.  It's like one of the better Adam Sandler movies.  Keep in mind I like the Sandler movies the goofier the better.  My favorite Sandler movies are Billy Madison, Wedding Singer and The Waterboy.  This movie would be most like Billy Madison.  This movie is crude but it is also funny so if you are a prude skip it but if you liked Billy Madison this movie was as funny has any I have seen in a while.

64,Finntroll,Shallow and stupid.,3,23 July 2004,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't have hoped for anything else. This is a Rob Schneider movie so I shouldn't have expected anything from it and I might have enjoyed it more.The first half hour of the movie must go to the history as one of the worst. We're introduced to a bunch of dreadful characters that I couldn't have liked less if I tried. We have the upper class girl Jessica who is mean to everyone, we have her dumb friend (played by the inept Anna Faris) and her incredibly unstable boyfriend Billy who seems to start crying in every scene he's in. It doesn't mather if he's being kissed or tricked, he always ends up looking like a roadkilled puppy. The way these people act in the first part of the movie is just horrible. They walk around and bully, steal and being stupid in general. I mean are we supposed to feel for these people?Anyway, the story twists so that Jessica gets transformed into a man and Rob Schneider who played a deadbeat for the first half hour of the movie gets transformed into a girl. This could have worked well but it's made in a bad way. Unlikeble characters, a predictable ending, you're usual stupid stereotypes, bad jokes, dumb twists and Anna Faris works like lead to sink this baby to the bottom of the movie ocean.Waste time on something else. 3/10",The Hot Chick

This is a rarity, a comedy which is funny from start to finish.In this body swapper a small time crook swaps places (and problems) with a cheerleader. It is essentially a vehicle for Rob Schneider to play a very masculine looking cheerleader, and he pulls it off with just the right amount of overacting. He's not going to win an Oscar for it, but then he can always play a hooker or battered wife for his next role.There were some fine cameos by Adam Sandler, Robert Davi and Angie Stone. Also refreshing was that there were a few politically incorrect jokes thrown in, one of which questioned me to believe what I'd heard!Pros - A bulls eyeCons - The crook's role was limitedOverall - Fine",The Hot Chick

And knowing that in advance, you should allow yourself to enjoy it.I just randomly caught this movie on TV and was very pleasantly surprised. It's silly, it's stupid, it's often over the top, it's heartwarming, it's well filmed.And Rob Schneider was AWESOME in this movie. I was stunned. He really, truly, was fantastic playing the part of a teenage girl. It was as if Rob Schneider didn't know he was in a stupid, slapstick comedy. And as a result, he sells us the story even more completely.I'm a child of the 80s, and this movie reminded me a bit of the original ""Just One Of The Guys.""

70,miguelsanchez69,Surprisingly funny comedy,8,26 June 2003,"First off let it be said, I'm a pretty big fan of comedies. I rather enjoyed Schneider's 1st film Deuce Bigelow, but gagged at the supreme awfulness of the Animal. The script to the Hot Chick is surprisingly good and well-organized (though it's premise is basically a raunchier riff on 80s body switch movies like vice-versa and freaky friday without any moralizing). It may not be original (similar to my other favorite comedy so far this year, old school) and it may not win any oscars , but it's funny, follows an established formula well, and doesn't deteriorate in the third act like a lot of comedies I've seen as of late into moralizing or seemingly tacked on drama. Rob Schneider and Anna Farris are incredibly funny together. Watch for a cameo by Adam Sandler. If youre in the mood for citizen kane or next year's oscar winners, look elsewhere. If you're in the mood for good, dumb, fairly raunchy fun to watch with a couple of friends - this movie's great.",The Hot Chick
71,morphricky,My guilty pleasure,7,23 February 2016,"I think Rob perfectly portrays the role of of a spoiled teenage girl and the clichés works in his favor. Mocking the stereotypes of how a spoiled girl acts allows him to overreact without it feeling over the top. I found the role of a teenage girl trapped in a mans body believable, unlike a lot of other movies where it's obvious that a person can't adapt to the role they are given. The jokes are plenty and the dorky friends of Jessica makes it easy to accept that they accept Rob as their long time friend. They just aren't very bright to begin with, so the plot seems plausible. I do have some criticism though. You barely see anything of the bad guy that is trapped in the girls body. It's as if they put all their ideas into Rob being a girl that they forgot about the other part. The ending also gets very sentimental and serious towards the end, which is a complete shift from the jokes that makes fun of the clichés. The movie ends in a predictable way. Why not mock that also? You feel nothing for the ending as you're not taking any of the characters serious in the first place. Although what happens to the bad guy is funny.",The Hot Chick
72,anacpcruz,Predictable and Enjoyable,9,5 November 2015,"The premise for this movie it's a very predictable and vulgar sequence of a perfect life of a beautiful, rich and healthy teenager, and her friends, in their high school years. Despite following the same ingredients of others successful comedies of the 00's, The Hot Chick have fantasy and the body transfer between characters that add a sparkle of geniality to the plot. Rachel Mac Addams, Anna Farris and the very skilled but underrated Robert Schneider, keep me interested. It's nostalgic to see the first work of Rachel, even before the hit Mean Girls. Although the story is not memorable, don't have a great turning point and don't provide any learning what so ever, I find it enjoyable to watch in a weekend afternoon. Therefore, I definitely don't recommend this piece to adults that love action, seriousness and a story with depth and meaning.",The Hot Chick

74,TJ1380,Better than I expected,7,11 May 2006,"I've never been a big fan of Rob Schneider's movies. I know it sounds cliché to say that his movies are really just ninety-minute ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, but I've always thought that was an accurate description. In fact, most of his movies seem to be ninety-minute versions of some of the weak ""SNL"" sketches that only seem to be filler to stretch the show to the full ninety minutes. I really wasn't expecting much from ""The Hot Chick,"" but I decided to give it a chance based on a friend's recommendation. Much to my surprise, it actually turned out to be pretty good.The plot of the movie revolves around a shallow and popular teenage girl named Jessica who ends up switching bodies with a petty criminal and overall loser played by Schneider thanks to two magical earrings. She spends almost the entire rest of the movie in this body, which means that Rob Schneider is essentially playing a teenage girl. I said that most of Schneider's movies seem like long ""SNL"" sketches, and as I am writing this I realize that the whole premise of the movie would feel more at home on ""SNL"" than in the movie theater. The filmmakers do however manage to pull this off rather well. Jessica is far from a likable person in the first act (essentially the only part of the movie when she's played by Rachel McAdams), so when we see her transform into Rob Schneider it's oddly satisfying. It's a comeuppance, and Jessica is humbled for the rest of the film by the fact that she's no longer the hot popular cheerleader she was before. Rob Schneider's performance as a teenage girl is generally the stuff of sketch comedy, but it is funny to see him in this role, especially since Jessica seems to forget that she's now a 30 year-old man instead of an 18 year-old girl (he does tend to overplay it at times, even to the point where he seems more girly than his female costars). The film also has some heart, with Jessica becoming kinder and a bit more caring once she literally sees her life through the eyes of another and learns that people are not always whom they seem to be.I admit that this film is much better than I thought it would be, but there are moments where it falls into the typical bad Hollywood comedy traps. There is the obligatory bathroom humor (although, considering the plot of the movie, it actually makes sense and comes across as kind of funny) as well as countless jokes at the expense of the token fat girl and one character's clueless Asian mother. It also has some big missed opportunities in that it only tells Jessica's side of the story. The man she changed into also spends the rest of the movie in Jessica's original body. The few scenes that we see of this total loser suddenly in the body of a hot 18 year-old girl are damn funny, but we aren't shown nearly enough. I got the idea that there was possibly a much funnier movie that was never made focusing on the misadventures of the ""Hot Chick Bandit."" I kind of want to see that.I'm still not a fan of Rob Schneider's movies, but I gave this one a chance and was pleasantly surprised. It's by no means a great movie, but it was still better and funnier than I expected it to be.",The Hot Chick

As soon as I saw this was a Happy Madison production... well I knew it wasn't going to be an epic. The storyline, which has been done many times, was for the most part pretty senseless, and I was especially disappointed that Rachel McAdams' character was left out of most of the film until the end.There were funny moments, but they were few and far between for me, and the appearance of Adam Sandler only made things worse.

Yes, Mr. Schneider is a one-trick-pony and the trick's been done. The only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10, is because, there were some really HOT LOOKING ""CHICKS"" in this movie. Thankfully, it was on my TV for free. I'm not 100% positive that the SNL man couldn't perform well (and more multi-dimensional) in a serious movie (which I doubt), but he ought to try. I read a few other reviews, and I agree with the one that said the kid who played Booger was the best. Ohhh, but how I like looking at the Mowry twins, Vergi, and the list goes on. I even like a few of the Moms. If Schneider can get with a production that has so many delectable females in it, why can't he find one without a pathetic script?

I'm sorry, but cheerleaders are the most revolting click in high school and are best made fun of on screen.  But how can I feel sorry for the bitch that is forced to be ugly, taking on the role of the victims that she scorns?  It's like saying that I feel sorry for the fat, unpopular girl that gets tortured and embarassed by the cheerleaders, but I'd feel worse if one of the cheerleaders suddenly became fat and unpopular.

Sure Sandler was in there but for 1-2 minutes max. Ok as for the movie now the movie had quite alot of laughs ok it is maybe because Schneider was acting like a women in this movie and did it so well that made me laugh but to be honest I liked this movie 7.5/10. The plot of it wasnt the best but the actors made it quite entertaining.For the people who can seriously watch this entire movie without laughing either you are extremely depressed or your getting mentally too old im not going to say everyone is going to love this movie as i didnt like it much the first time i saw it but you have got to take a look for yourself.Enjoy !!!,The Hot Chick

85,storm_mica,Lower than the low,1,7 September 2015,"There are many problems with this movie but the biggest is: IT's NOT FUNNY. Not even a single bit.The lead guy (Rob Schneider) is as funny as cancer... seriously bad undergraduate stuff that looks more like a church campfire sketch than a PG movie. Honestly this makes Mr Bean look sophisticated and mature... The supporting cast are as interesting as a dial tone; even the ones thrown in for the ""eye-candy"" factor weren't especially attractive.Another problem is that this movie is as sanitised as the Brady Bunch. You almost expect Alice to pop up somewhere with some idiotic line and that catatonic look on her face.But in spite of the goody two shoes treatment, the level of racism in this movie is through the roof. From the Asian woman who works painting nails in the mall who speaks ""Engrish"", the old black guy working in the men's toilet, the young black guy who liked the fat chick with the big bum the list of ugly stereo types goes on and on and on.In spite of using racial vilification and bullying to prop it up, this train wreck falls flat on its face.Watching this movie was a truly vile experience; which is quite an achievement for a ""comedy"".",The Hot Chick
86,stodmyk,Not as horrible as expected...,5,11 April 2004,"... but it's still, after all, a base collection of cheesy gags hung on a single comedic hook. Rob Schneider as an 18-year-old girl -- woo hoo.There were a few laughs in this one, and as I said, it was better than expected. But I had VERY low expectations, so how much does that really say. Schneider does as good a job as can be hoped for as a snobby rich gal who wakes up as a grubby 30-year-old guy. His reaction to having armpit hair, for example, is quite entertaining. But like most films by SNL alum, The Hot Chick would have been better served as a series of 90-second bits for the sketchcom institution from whence they came.Anna Faris does the typical job of playing the wide-eyed teen best friend, despite being eight years too old. (No surprise here, Hollywood cast actresses in their late twenties to play high school seniors. No wonder teen girls are so screwed up, and no wonder adult actresses are mostly bulimic.)Adam Sandler's cameo as a pothead store clerk is both pleasant and annoying. Like his (and most) SNL skits, it was repetitive and predictable after the first three times. But at least his bits (unlike most in these flicks) were kept down in length and became less frequent as the film went on.In all, it wasn't a total waste of time. It's self-aware, in that the film doesn't take itself too seriously -- this is the biggest problem in Sandler's, and, say, Pauly Shore's, movies. Schneider seems to know his work is fluff at best, and just plays within that framework. The saddest thing about the Hot Chick? My girlfriend LOVED it. *sigh* Should that tell me something about the fact that she loves ME?",The Hot Chick

I had seen this movie when it first came out with my family, and was too young to understand anything. Then again, that was over 7 years ago. To brain-dead to think otherwise, I saw it. From beginning to end, we were laughing our butts off!All I remember is that Adam Sandler had a cameo, there were some penis and fart jokes, Ana Faris looked extremely hot, and slapstick was extremely frequent. In terms of regular, good old comedies, this probably doesn't fit. However, when you're mind is somewhere else, this film really works! I would like to see it sober, but I am afraid I will likely abhor it. I love all films, and consider myself a film buff. I watch new films at the cinema the day or weekend they come out, and I usually agree with the critics. This film was panned, and I would likely also dislike it. However, I cannot forget the extreme laughter my crew and I experienced, during what were likely lame, slapstick moments. Nor can I let go of the strong emotions some of us felt during the ""emotional"" parts. Therefore, I shall treasure it for what it is:a treat for high or drunk people, though probably not so good for regular audiences.",The Hot Chick

90,ji8464,Has some funny moments.,5,26 October 2003,"Unfortunately the one joke can only go for so long. This scenario of body switching has probably been done to death by now, so most of the good lines have been done.Had it's moments and was enjoyable for some light entertainment where you don't have to think too hard.",The Hot Chick
91,Heffernan99,"Nothing great, average in everything",4,10 August 2013,"So how many movies have you seen where a girl becomes a guy and a guy becomes a girl? Many, right? Well this movie is no different and is just like the rest. Jessica (McAdams) is a an arrogant teenager who loves hanging out with her girlfriends. One day she steals a pair of voodoo earrings from a store which in turn out to have super powers. The earrings, if worn by 2 different people, would ensure that their bodies get exchanged but the soul remains the same. Jessica's body gets exchanged with a low-life criminal (Schneider) who manages to find one of the missing earrings. Jessica now needs to live in a mans body and needs to convince her friends of her story and take their help in finding her true body back. The movie is a load of utter trash and is not even remotely funny. The only funny bit is watching Schneider in being a girl, not cause its funny but because he makes a fool of himself.",The Hot Chick
92,groovymike_16,HILARIOUS!!! Surprisingly one of the years best comedies! Highly recommended for a fun time!,10,18 December 2002,"THE HOT CHICK (2002)Believe it or not, The Hot Chick is one of the best comedies of the year. It's been awhile since I've laughed so much at the theater. To my surprise, it even held up really well upon a second viewing, which is rare for comedies.Anna Faris (Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2, May) gives another winning comedic performance here as April, proving she's one of the best young comedic actresses working today. Her facial expressions are absolutely classic. She never fails to make me laugh and I look forward to her future projects. Rob Schneider gives a really fun performance in what is his best comedy to date, not that it was too hard to top Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (7/10 or B-) or The Animal (5/10 or C).Overall, The Hot Chick exceeded my expectations and proved to be a real fun time. It was laugh-out-loud funny from beginning to end. I even appreciated its sweet side and its good message, although most people probably won't take it too seriously anyway. This is not a great film by any means, but it is a very fun one. If you just want to have a good time and laugh then you can't do much better than The Hot Chick.Grade: 8/10 or B+ or **** of *****",The Hot Chick
93,gusmcrae,This Hot Chick enjoyed it,9,27 December 2002,"I wasn't really looking forward to this movie at all.  I haven't seen a lot of Rob Schneider, but what little I did see was usually grossout.  Needless to say I was expecting more of that with this little flick.The movie though turned out to be...well pretty awesome.  It's not going to win an oscar, but it's certainly far from the movie I expected to see.  Sure there were the cliches (popular blonde cheerleaders, fat chicks with food in their hands at all times, scary goths)...but somehow they worked together. It turns out that those cliches are simply empty pictures that we get of other people.  Who know a Rob Schneider movie could manage to point that out??As for Mr. Schneider....well he was pretty darn good.  I thought it would be incredibly silly watching him as a girl.  It was at times, but overall I think this movie pulled out some of his best comic acting.  He was able to be sensitive and funny and pull it off believably.  I'd like to see him at least nominated for his role ;)The other actors in the movie...mostly a bunch of nameless beauties...also pulled their weight.  The characters were pretty well fleshed out (which was nice to see since my last movie was MAID IN MANHATTEN where no thought at all seemed to have been put into character development.)  Matthew Lawrence was looking hot as usual :)I give the movie 9 out of 10 stars.  See it if you want to laugh.  It's actually worth the money :)",The Hot Chick
94,graphicstyle7,Rob Schneider is WAY underrated!,7,26 August 2008,"This is a very charming, sweet, funny movie I can watch over and over again. In a very unassuming way it says a lot about men and women and what is expected of them. I like the way girls are portrayed as real individuals... something not often done in any kind of film these days. Rob Schneider does an excellent and hysterically funny job as a girl in a man's body and the different things he has to deal with.I think both Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider have had a lot to offer through the years and have been sniffed at by the critics because they have ""lowbrow"" forms of comedy. This is a film definitely worth a look if you have missed it before or believed the reviews.",The Hot Chick
95,yemp,How can this movie have only 5.5??,10,8 June 2019,This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Every time I watch I laugh so hard. People ignore the bad rate and give this a chance. You won't regret it,The Hot Chick
96,dcl1994,A great comedy!!!!!!!,9,23 July 2006,"You know we all have those movies where we could watch them again and again and never get tired of them, well, the Hot Chick was certainly one of them. First of all, Rob Shnider is crack-up hilarious, Racheal McAdams is one of those funny people that can get annoying, but just have something about them that makes you laugh, and Anna Faris is very funny with her certain ""voice"". Anyway,you can see they put some clever effort into this move and it shows, believe me! You can laugh at his movie the whole way through. If you likes, Shaun of the Dead, Scary movie 1, Scary Movie 2, Scary Movie 3, Scary Movie 4 and all those other dumb movies, you will LOVE Hot Chick! Peace!!!!!",The Hot Chick
97,gibajawil,it was ok,6,18 May 2003,"the hot chick is a funny movie but the story of it just plain sucks the fun is mostly stupidity , and by the way i always thought anna faris acting was kinda retarded reprising her role from scary movie but in this film i see the same acting so i guess she's like that. but o well i give this movie 2 out of 5 stars",The Hot Chick

Hadn't seen it in some yrs until today and quickly realized why I loved this movie so much as 34 yro I still find myself dying laughing and constititany rewinding !!!!! Greatttttt movie at least deserves 7.9 in my eyes !!!,The Hot Chick
100,mellywoodsmansion,Rob Schneider is a woman that's the most interesting thing about this movie,1,9 September 2021,Rob Schneider is one of the most sorry excuses for an actor this is on par with an average Rob Schneider movie Atrocious it is very long despite being the shortest out of every Rob Schneider movie it still feels like it goes on for an eternity this movie is really bad and boring but it's a perfect Rob Schneider movie 1/10.,The Hot Chick
101,HayleyM1004,"Silly, but cute...",6,4 July 2003,"Not wanting to dismiss this movie entirely after seeing the trailer, I decided to sit down and view this with an open mind. To my surprise, I actually found myself giggling at the antics of Rob Schneider trying to portray a teenage girl. Kudos to Rob...if he ever decides to find a new profession, he could always do one of those male reviews in full dress...but let's hope he gets a good wax job this time! This movie was silly, but enjoyable.",The Hot Chick
102,chrihern,It's a silly movie but a good one,10,7 September 2021,"Don't understand why some people expect every movie to be an Oscar candidate. This movie is silly and never pretend to be anything different: delivers a lot of easy but effective comedy.There is a worth of more than 30 min of deleted scenes and honestly they did a good job getting a final cut, many of them are nice but will made the movie too long and boring.As an early Rachel McAdams movie is a gem, she did a good impression, is a bit pity she didn't get more time in the theatrical cut and many ideas of Rachel acting as a guy scenes never got finished.",The Hot Chick
103,ggdollzfanatic,Matthew Lawrence is hilarious!,9,8 November 2003,"I am a huge fan of Matthew Lawrence, and I decided to watch this movie based solely on the fact that he is in it.  I really didn't think that I would like it, but I laughed until I cried when I watched this movie.  It was hilarious!  Everything about this movie was just plain crazy. Rob Schneider was a comical genius.  He really convinced me that he was a young woman stuck in a man's body.  The voice, the mannerisms...all of it was just really convincing.  He must have had to do a lot of ""painful"" research. All of the other actors and actresses were great, too. They added a fun element to the movie.My favorite part of the movie would definitely have to be the part where Rob's character chases Matthew's character Billy around, trying to convince him that he is in fact Jessica, stuck in that body.Normally, I wouldn't watch a movie based on who is in it, but I am really glad that I chose to rent this one.  I would recommend this movie to anyone having a bad day, or even to someone who hasn't had a good laugh in a long time.",The Hot Chick
104,Beanie72,don't listen to the critics this is hilarious,8,18 November 2007,This movie is hilarious. its one of the only 1 star movies that I really really like. If you like Rob Shcneider then you'll def like it.Yeah its not an award winner but its enough to make you laugh out loud. BUT you have to be somewhat immature to laugh at this movie. If you are easily offended or like more witty humour then this isn't for you.Rob as a girl is hilarious. The facial expressions and the voice right there is enough to make me laugh.If you see this movie don't go in with a serious attitude. its just a silly funny movie. I can see how people don't appreciate it because they are older and more serious about matters. But under the age of 25 you probably will get a kick out of it,The Hot Chick
105,wangxinfree651,Pretty sassy comedy,8,21 May 2003,"I just enjoy watching this kinda movie, it got a pretty sassy story and a bunch of my favorite acting crew, Robert is really funny in this flick, also, all the hot chicks are hilarious.

107,spotdog19,This movie surprised me!,7,24 October 2010,"In all honesty, I was expecting something along the lines of a ""Scary Movie"" or something really stupid like it. The movie was actually funny albeit very predictable. Even so, I was entertained and enjoyed the movie.If I had to knock the movie at all I think the makers of the movie could have spent a little more time focusing on what was happening with Rachel McAdams possession of Rob Schneider's characters body. It was a Rob Schneider movie and I guess he has the bigger name (but really, who wouldn't want to see more of Rachel McAdams?) so he gets move screen time.If you aren't expecting comedy genius, you will be entertained...enjoy!",The Hot Chick

That was so funny! And when Rob has to listen to her father fart, he says 'stinko DE mayo'. That catch phrase has been worn out at my school...but every time someone uses it, we still crack up! Rachel McAdams is an aspiring young actress who stretches her thespian skills the most in this film. The scene in the Strip Joint where she is confronted by Rob and the girlfriends was really really good! I wouldn't classify this movie as a chick flick--I think it's just real clever comedy.",The Hot Chick
109,gezbexley,Freaky Friday but even better!,10,11 January 2006,"Just watched The Hot Chick for the first time, I thought it would be funny but it's even better than I expected I think it's brilliant.It's certainly a film we'll be adding to our Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider collection. Really well thought out and not as cheesy as your average American film predictable, I also like the Adam Sandler slapstick humour! A film hasn't made me laugh so much in ages. As for Rob Schneider acting like a woman well he's superb. Besides it's top two actors there's quite few others as well,one being Rachel McAdams who is also excellent in The Wedding Crashers and The Family Stone. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed and rate it 10 out of 10.",The Hot Chick
110,dlozano,Underrated!,9,5 July 2003,"This movie is so like the other movies with Schneider and Sandler.  It's funnier by far than ""Waterboy"".  You'll love the warmth and message that's in every Sandler film.  The actress who played the hot chick is soooo funny as Rob Schneider.  She's not getting the credit she deserves. 
The hot chick's little brother, her boyfriend (perfectly played by Matthew Lawrence!), and all the side characters from Ling Ling, Ling Ling's mom, and the hot chick's best friend are just fun to watch.  This movie is funny, and I will end in saying Rob Schneider is sooooo good in this film.  You'll get a lot of laughs!",The Hot Chick
111,binkzz,"Great film, excellent work from Rob",10,26 March 2003,"The film comes to a slightly slow start, but after Adam Sandler's speech about Nelson Mandela it's unstoppable. I viewed this with a couple of friends and found it hilarious. Rachel McAdams' acting was below par, but fortunately she's only in a a very few scenes. Rob Schneider's acting was top notch and he even looked kinda sexy in a cheerleading outfit =). The story isn't very serious, so take it for what it is. If you liked Duce Bigalow, Male Gigolo, you'll love this film.",The Hot Chick
112,stanwayne1,Did not expect much but----,6,19 January 2003,Saw this movie by default. Had gone to see Maid in Manhattan but this movie played first so decided to see it. All the bad press it received set me up to be unimpressed-but.. It is a fun movie - ridiculous in parts but fun none the less. The support cast was great and truly entertaining. At this point I would have to recommend it for sure. Funny and even has tender moments.,The Hot Chick
113,DanTheMan16,Rob Schnider + Panties = Very Bad Movie,2,23 December 2002,"This was the worst Rob Schnider movie to date, although the others were not that good either. There are some minor SPOILERS ahead so if you do not want to know anymore, stop here. The best parts of this film were the all of the scenes that did not have Rob Schnider in them. He was so unentertaining that I reverted to counting the number of time the crowd laughed while Rob Schnider was on screen. Unfortunatly, that got boring too because I did not got into double digits until 47 minutes after I started my ""fun"" little game. The funniest character in the movie was Ling Ling's mom. She was hilarious! When she said ""Ling Ling, you forgot your Bling Bling!"", I almost fell out of my chair laughing. And when she followed that up by saying, ""Niggra Please!"", I finally felt that I got my money's worth. But when she left in the car with the hydrolics, I think that was the first, last, and only time everybody in the theater laughed at the same time.When somebody is not good at something, a wiity, sarcastic comment would be, ""Don't quit your day job."" Well Rob Schnider sucks at his ""day job"" and if he cared about the quality of the human race and the movie industry, he would quit this day job because he has really stunk up the joint in his last couple films; its been all downhill for Rob ever since he was in ""Home Alone 2"". He just is not funny, in any form of the word. He has not gotten a laugh out of me since he told Nicky to cover Winkler in bees in ""Little Nicky"", and that was not even his movie!Do yourself a favor and do not see this Schnider movie. On second thought, do not see this one, any before this one, or any he might make after this one. Please, spare yourselves the agony!!!",The Hot Chick

115,daparry,Cringeworthy and predictable,2,6 December 2020,"There are some good ideas in there and Rob Schneider mugs it up for al he is worth, but the basic idea quickly gets labored. There are just too many situational jokes that are extended too far. The humor is often just too sophomoric, and the sexual innuendo and tired cliches take the place get tiresome and too predictable. This i a film that needed a light touch and a good script. It got another. Which is a pity, as a few scenes really are good.",The Hot Chick

117,WolverineGirl,Beyond my expectations,7,20 August 2003,"I don't consider myself a Rob Schneider fan in general, and when a friend of mine rented ""The Hot Chick,"" I thought it would be a lame ""Freaky Friday""-ish attempt at comedy. However, once we popped in the movie, I couldn't stop laughing. Schneider is uncanny in his exaggerated performance of a conceited, self-absorbed teenage girl. He nails the voice and expressions, and every scene (especially those between Schneider and Faris, who plays Jessica's best friend April). The acting, though obviously restricted to a certain level per the genre, is excellent. I especially loved the fact that April's keyring included about 20 keychains - so accurate for a teenage girl. Lots of cute, funny touches in the movie. I definitely (though unexpectedly) recommend it!",The Hot Chick
118,amy-jane-1,One of the funniest film i've watched in a long time,8,2 April 2007,first of all i think Rob Schneider done a great job in playing the part of Jessica he definitely made this film worth watching. honestly this has got to be one of the funniest comedy's i have watched in a long time i highly recommend watching it for yourselves you wont be disappointed. It is both easy watching and an hilariously funny comedy. i loved every last bit of this film except from the part of April played by Anna Faris i find her very irritating in every film i've ever watched with her in she has always been the same playing an annoying dumb blonde with a voice that goes straight through you. overall though I do recommend it.,The Hot Chick
119,jazmaan,Rob Schnieder's Best,7,6 September 2010,"Rob Schneider at his best. OK maybe that's not saying a lot. But if you're in the mood for this kind of thing, its actually not that bad. You may feel guilty for laughing, but you WILL laugh! The premise and set up are ridiculously unbelievable, but once Rob is transformed he does a terrific job of playing a woman imprisoned in a man's body. It would have been very easy for Schneider to have played his part as ""gay"" but he succeeds in avoiding that completely and actually makes his character sympathetic in her/his plight.This movie also has a couple of very interesting cameo appearances. Look for the men's room attendant and the dread locked drummer!",The Hot Chick

This movie is made for young teenagers that laugh at the same joke over & over & over. I liked Duece and Animal, but this movie was never funny or entertaining.

123,jeffgrooves,Rob Schneider Does It Again!,8,6 December 2002,"I have to admit it, Rob Schneider has done it again!  He has made another hilarious movie in which he plays some sort of crazy character trapped in a bizarre situation with zany laughs laced all throughout.  DEUCE BIGALO was hilarious.  THE ANIMAL had some really funny moments.  And now with THE HOT CHICK, Schneider creates a whole bunch of new belly-laughs.  Schneider isn't your typical comedy actor...there is something different about him that makes him stand out in a strange sort of way.  Not only is this movie full of laughs, but there are plenty of beautifully sexy women laced throughout the film to keep the scenery HOT.  Rachael McAdams as Jessica is a beauty! I've never seen her before, but she certainly did a stand out job in this film as the prissy popular girl who finds herself switching bodies with Schneider.  Scary Movie's Anna Farris also lights up the screen with her pretty smile, sweet persona, and sexy new blonde look.  Adam Sandler also makes a pretty hilarious Cameo as a mellow pot-head.  This is a great flick to watch if you're looking for something with a lot of laughs or to just have some fun!

This movie is definatly the surprise hit of the year, or it's up there with My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  After the first 5 minutes of this movie, I could not stop laughing.  This is definatly non - stop laughter.  There are scenes with a pillow fight and a guy telling his undying love for his girlfriend which are the two funniest scenes in the movie.  Everyone in the theater was dying of laughter.  Me and my friend fell out of our seats laughing so hard at some scenes.  Another good laugh is where Jessica inside Clive's body will say things and a guy will be right behind her/him everytime.  Then at the end you'll see why.  I am definatly going to go see this movie again.  FUNNIEST MOVIE OF 2002!  Now I think every one should go see this movie!",The Hot Chick

I am a great fan of Happy Madison Productions and have more or less seen all their films. The hot chick is about a stuck up high school cheerleader living a perfect life when after stealing mystical magical earrings swaps body's with a petty criminal. The funniest scenes are the ones where they forget they are now the opposite sex. When Rob Schneider seductively eats a cream drink to get it for free forgetting he/she is a now a tramp like 30 year old man was hilarious and Sandlers lil secondary character was also a joy to see on screen with the constant banging on the drums to add effect, even if that gag came up twice it was still funny. So i would say go see this film, but don't go to extreme lengths",The Hot Chick
128,pshermanwallabywaysydney,The summary of the story is that this pretty popular girl swaps bodies with a thief with hilarious results,8,10 February 2006,"I saw ""The Hot Chick"" on telly las night. . Most of the film was brill.Except there was afew things I didn't like about it. When Jessica got turned into the thief, there was a scene towards the end where she beat someone up really badly. I think that it was far too violent. Also too many people asked to see his/her thing. The joke was over used. Also why did the writers do the bit where jessica's dad showed the ""gardener"" his thing. But apart from that it was a lot funnier than i thought it would be. i loved their rhyme (Boys are cheats and liars...) and some of the jokes were really good. I thought Adam Sandler was so funny. I loved that Clive (ie Jessica) stuck up for April and especially when he pretended to be her new boyfriend on the phone to Jake. I loved how the writers let April find out about Jessica. It would have been a pretty boring film if it involved Clive trying to hide from everybody. Also the actors were fabulous. There was so many of them that i recognize but didn't know from where. I think Anna Farris was brill. Billy was gorgeous and the Mowry twins were funny. i was right when i thought i spotted Ashlee Simpson. Anyway the film was hilarious and I will definitely have to rent it out or buy it.",The Hot Chick

You know the kind, Happy Gilmore, Deuce Bigalow, etc.  They are all good for a few cheap laughs, but do not really compare to the cinematic greats by Speilburg and P.T. Anderson.  I am not stating that there is anything wrong with this just making a short point.  Regardless, it is a mildly funny movie, especially if you enjoy this type of humor.  A lot of slapstick and corny jokes fill this movie.  I do have to say that Rob Schneider does pretty well, playing a female teenager throughout a majority of the film.  All of the nuancing does make for a few laughs on screen.  I gave this film a six.",The Hot Chick

This film is just simply not funny. My mates though Adam Sandler was funny in his brief parts, but I disagree. Its total garbage! Rob Schneider's films are not usually good, but none of the others I have seen are as bad as this! Deuce Bigalow and The Animal are at least funny in places, unlike this film.

I've become quite a fan of Rachel McAdams recently, and I quite like Anna Faris's films also.The film is about a high school girl who has it all, and a down and out criminal in his mid 30s. Somehow they switch bodies and we see the consequences unfold.The film itself was pretty awful. The script wasn't funny and neither were the actors. There were major points glossed over and the characters actions were completely unrealistic, even for a comedy of this type. It was bizarre how they almost completely ignored one of the two affected characters for much of the film, such a wasted opportunity.The dilemma I have is I am unable to give it less than 4/10. Despite how bad it was, at no point did I want to switch off or even get bored with the film.",The Hot Chick

I saw it with that in mind and, even with that mindset, I found it a bit over the top. It was worth the price of admission to see Robert Davi though. Even though he was grossly underused. This guy needs more exposure. Rob Schneider was his predictible manic self but the story line was fun. Again, I went to see this film for a dose of Robert Davi. It was a small dose and I'll need another spoonful soon. Won't SOMEBODY give him a role that he's worthy of?",The Hot Chick

138,spottay212,One of the funniest movies I've seen,10,5 January 2006,"In my opinion, I thought this movie was HILARIOUS. There were a ton of things that really had me laughing loudly like their facial expressions or when April (I think?) says something about having pepper spray on her key chain and then pulls out this gigantic clump of key rings and frantically tries to search for it. For some reason, I thought it was so funny. Surprisinly...it also had me kind of anxious to find out what happened in the end. I saw it on TV and during the commercials I was dying to find out what was going to happen. The plot is kind of strange, but what would you do if you switched bodies with the opposite sex? Yeah, makes ya think, don't it?I don't think I've ever laughed so much at a movie.",The Hot Chick
139,ThePhelpsTwinsROCK,'Hot Chick' will cool you down..,3,11 October 2003,"Another movie bringing the magick of the ancient times to today, unfortunately it does not meet up with the recent productions. This movie will provide you with entertainment if you do not want to think while watching a movie, in a coma, or otherwise catatonic. While this movie does have some messages throughout, and there are some funny moments, too, but none of these save the movie.The cinematography was poorly done and while watching this movie I noticed scenes where the lighting showed absolutely nothing. This really needed work. The script seemed like it was written by someone with penis envy (sorry Rob Schneider) and those were some of the best lines.I was completely disappointed by the acting in this movie. Though ""Booger"" (Matt Weinberg), Jessica Spencer's (Rachel McAdams) brother, was wonderful as her cross-dressing sibling and the only shinning star in this movie. As for Rob Schneider I realize that playing the part of a high school cheerleader is a tough act, but he does not pull it off at all. The rest of the cast is very much lacking, as well, showing little enthusiasm and they appear to have no direction whatsoever.After switching bodies with a skanky male thief via ancient magickal earrings, Jessica finds herself unable to wear her clothes ~! *what WILL she DO?!* The race against time begins and Rob Schneider as ""Jessica"" must find a way to get her body back. This is where those pre-mentioned messages (however ambiguous) come through. This and the constant suggestions on where to hide your weed by Adam Sandler raise this movie, if only slightly. This film will either make you laugh a lot or make you wonder what was the point? This movie gets 3 carrots.",The Hot Chick

We have the Asian woman who speaks poor English and works at a nail salon in the mall; we have the old black man who's a bathroom attendant; we have the black woman who's a fortune teller; we have Rob Schneider pretending to be a jalapeno-eating Mexican gardener named ""Taquito""; we have the black guy who's hot for the overweight girl with a big butt... shall I continue, or do you get the point? The movie itself is horrible -- I didn't find myself laughing at all, but just shaking my head and such an overused ""switching bodies"" plot and angry that we still are seeing movies in 2002 with the same old minority stereotypes. Really offensive.",The Hot Chick

Grab a pal, a drink and some popcorn.This is not the Lord of The Rings. You are not supposed to take this kind of movie seriously. Sure Rob Schneider is odd, but you know what kind of humour you get, and sometimes that's just what you want. Rachel McAdams is pretty and all, but I think I've fallen in love with Anna Faris who is just wonderful. I just love those faces she does at Rob.The weak part of it actually, is that you don't get to see the crook exploring possibilities with the girls body. Perhaps for the best as it most likely wouldn't be appropriate.In the end you have a very screwy story, with a funny guy you cannot help but like, some charming girls and a sweet story with a happy ending.

My husband just thinks it is ""OK"" so obviously not one for guys to enjoy for what it is.Thoroughly enjoy watching this film every now and again and would recommend it.

However, while this movie is no masterpiece and certainly not for the sophisticated in humour it has certain merits and I thought it was surprisingly touching in dealing with her (is it Stacy's?) relationships and the way she affects her friends and families and how they come to deal with her. I thought it avoided the in-your-face moral messages for the most part and that is most definitely to be merited. Also, I thought Rob Schneider did pretty good in his role and many bits did make me laugh. Good fun then, providing you're not looking for serious film-making, or even particularly good film-making. And also girls are portrayed in this film as dim-witted, shoe-shopping obsessives, which is a complete fabrication!!",The Hot Chick

But 10 minutes into it, and I was hooked - there is a lot of clever humour alongside the slapstick, and despite the sheer ludicrousness of the situation, the story captured my interest in a very engaging way. Some really good acting, a few killer lines, and an ability to laugh at itself makes this film an excellent piece of escapism and entertainment. It doesn't set out to be anything but entertainment, so if you are looking for brain food or deep meaningful dialogue, look elsewhere, but for something to have a surreal laugh at and forget the troubles of the world for 2 hours, this film is ideal.",The Hot Chick

The other actors are also really good ( Bobby is the little kid in ""Mrs. Doubtfire""!) Its a really silly movie, but I've got to admit that that's the kind of movies I watch (danish humor is the best!!!) It's really silly movie so if your not into that kind of weird humor then..well then your weird he he no but it's probably more a movie for the younger generation although my my parents had a good laugh watching it.

148,Aquateen1717,Mean Chicks Get A Blow Job,8,26 June 2005,"Jessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams) is her high school's most popular student, but also its meanest. Together with her friends, Jessica makes life miserable for most of the people around her. But her attitude changes when she comes into contact with mystical identity-swapping earrings, and her body is swapped with that of a grimy, small-time crook named Clive (Rob Schneider). Stuck inside a shell she can't quite figure out, Jessica must make amends with those she's offended, before her new body threatens to ruin her relationship with her boyfriend (Matthew Lawrence), the big cheerleading contest, and, of course, the prom. I'll be honest, ""The Hot Chick"" (IMDb listing) is feebly directed, written with a distinct aim at crudity and dangerous stereotyping, drags on for more than 100 minutes, and stars the less-than-appetizing Rob Schneider. Yet, with the help of producer Adam Sandler, and Schneider's burgeoning writing talents, ""The Hot Chick"" overcomes its weak design, and turns out to be a completely agreeable, often very funny experience. There's a lot of comedic road to cover with this plot, and Schneider (with director and co-writer Tom Brady) does his best to touch on every teenage girl cliché and absurd situation. Coming off his similarly silly ""The Animal,"" Schneider is growing more confident with each new film. ""The Hot Chick"" features Schneider's best performance to date, as he eats up the chance to turn his goofy 40-year-old male body and narrow personality into that of a sexually-charged 17-year-old girl. The results are quite funny, with Schneider finding time to lampoon subjects like teen-girl key chains, morning erections, pillow fights, the mystery of male genitalia, strip club rules and the giddy taboo of teenage drinking. It's all written in a extravagantly bizarre Sandleresque way (Sandler also cameos here), that merges the absurd with the deliriously funny. Helping the film is the supporting cast, namely Anna Faris and Rachel McAdams. Faris is a veteran of satiric comedy -- she was in the Wayans Brothers' ""Scary Movie"" films -- and she has a way of wringing a laugh out of anything. With her gigantic eyes and willingness to go broad for a response, Faris is a pleasure in ""The Hot Chick,"" and steals the film from Schneider when she can. A talented comedienne at 26, Faris has a long career ahead of her. The same is true of McAdams, who has the unenviable task of embodying the other side of this gender-switching comedy. Like Faris, McAdams lets herself look foolish to find the laugh, and she succeeds easily. It's a nice debut for this young actress. ""The Hot Chick"" swerves into trouble with its pacing. Every scene is 30 seconds longer than it should be, making the film sluggish. The picture seems one editorial pass away from being truly great, with jokes run into the ground and performances carried on a little too long. Arguably, ""The Hot Chick"" may have other problems that simple edits won't fix, but it's funny more often than not, and I don't ask much more than that from wacky undertakings like this.",The Hot Chick

It's PG-13 for a reason, people! If you aren't offended easily by this sort of humor, i'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh.

The characters are unbelievable as they are being comic in one scene and being intimate and emotional in an other-like i are you can't get a date or your husband loves you.Another problem is that it is about two people switching bodies and yet I only see the man in the woman's body for less than a minute.

She loses one of the earrings at the gas station, and a robber finds it and takes it home with everything else he stole.

Now you probably think, here we go again, but this movie not only tells us about the crisis at hand, but the issue's the girls parents have to deal with, her little brothers sexuality and the fact that they are all drifting apart.The funniest scene, a hard one to pick, had to be when they were in the shop and 'The Weed Guy' is showing them all the things in the shop and after every one adding, ""You can also put your weed in there."" Or the entire movie!!! But seriously, this is a very funny movie with a great cast including Rob Schneider, Rachel McAdams, Anna Faris and a bit part from punk singer Ashlee Simpson!

Anna Faris is just ""HOT"" (loved her since I first saw her in Scary Movie) and Rachel McAdams is a star on the rise, I wish we had seen more of her.  Plus the fact that Adam Sandler and Michelle Branch have cameos was nice and I love that the producers used a song by the best rock star most people have never heard of, Butch Walker.  Using his song ""We'll Take Tomorrow (One Day at a Time)"" was a perfect choice for the 2 scenes it's used in.

Right from the outset, the acting is terrible, the movie is really goody-goody, i suppose from a guys perspective, maybe that could be contradicted.

Dick Gregory, the famous peace activist and folk music star plays a great cameo as a wash room attendant. I really liked Deuce Bigelow....but this is a clear step beyond in writing and acting.

In my humble opinion, this movie sucks. The only reason I give it a 2 as opposed to a 1 is because it is somewhat funny. Somewhat is a strong word for the amount of funny in the movie though. My sister really likes this movie but I cannot see how. The attempts at jokes are lame and unfunny. The joke that comes up WAY too much is what the girl gains when she becomes Rob Schnider. I don't even want to think about that. Rob Schnider, as usual, is unfunny and hard to look at. And go figure, but you can't have a Rob Schnider movie without Adam Sandler. Sandler is a good actor and I would even rather see him in Schnider's part. In the long run, don't buy it. Save your money.

I must ad, that Hardin woman, who plays the boss's boss on the Office, is like, about as beautiful as can be. Does not hurt make this movie enjoyable to watch. I liked Schneider in The Animal, and as the lady's man (Gigolo), and this 'The Hot Chick' fits his resume to a tee.

This movie is great to watch with friends and its easy to memorize the whole movie even without trying because its so hilarious! I also love Rob Schnieder because he can make you believe that he is actually Jessica, a teen-aged girl.

I love how he could do they girl's side perfectly, it was just so well done. Rachel McAdams also played a good role, I found her role perfect as well. Anna Faris was a good pick for the role of April, I couldn't see anyone else doing it.I loved the bit where Rob (as Spence/Jessica) was cleaning the showers and started crying while Billy was saying those nice things about her and they stare at him and he says ""Someone _____ in the locker"". I also loved the bit where Rachel (as Clive/Rob) ran into the store to grab the tampons and says ""I gotta do what!"".

She never knows her family loves her so much. It let me think about mime. I always complain why my father or someone else to do so, or why don't they do as my mind.

177,dragotar,One of the funniest movies I ever seen,10,9 August 2021,Everytime I hear or see name Billy - I ALWAYS remember that funny scene from this movie at 85:25. Once you saw this movie - you will never forget it.,The Hot Chick
178,kaitbrookelozo,"It's not a TEN, but the overall rating doesn't sit right with me.",10,23 August 2021,Uhm... this gets a 5.5/10 and the new The Suicide Squad movie got an 8/10? .... I don't understand humanity. This movie has an original style and sense of humor. Classic comedy.,The Hot Chick
179,chenterly,One incredibly horrible comedy I ever saw,3,10 October 2021,"First things first, this still should've been rated R to begin with and forget the PG-13 one it unfortunately has.Also this is one movie that I even find more hated than annoying voiced celebrities. For example: I would rather hear Gilbert Gottfried for hours over this terribly made derelict and repulsive movie.I respect everyone's opinion we all have them, but I also would recommend that you never have this one in your stupid humor collection too.",The Hot Chick
180,babyangel,It's sooooo funny !,10,13 December 2002,I sincerely recommend this flick!

181,quellopazzesco81,"A very odd movie, but very Rob Schneider",7,4 January 2003,"""Laughing my butt off"" is one of the biggest phrases you will hear when people talk about the hot chick.  yes the movie was funny, but it was so Rob Schneider and way too predictable.  he always ends up turning into something so...i guess thats where i base my opinion from.  it gets boring after a while -- but its a harmless sort of corny movie and that was all it was meant to be. overall, it was OK.",The Hot Chick
182,Moviechicka88,The Best Film of the year!,10,17 June 2003,I totally loved this movie!  Rob Schneider is one of the funniest people alive! This is definitely the greatest movie of the year! I'm even hoping for a sequel! Sandler's cameo was hilarious and Anna Faris (April) and Rachel McAdams (Jessica) make the perfect on-screen best friends! I definitely give this movie a 10!,The Hot Chick
183,waitesy_dc,One of the best teen flicks along with American pie!,10,29 November 2004,This is a quality movie. Its got the chicks and the comedy and i highly recommend it if your into your teen flicks. The plot is bascily the hottest chick in town gets changed over night to the loser of losers of the town which is a man and they have to unite two earrings together to change bodies back and its so funny. I downloaded by accident as it was under a different file name so i only got half of it and i never got the name of the movie. Like a year later i seen it in a shop and picked it up and i laughed through all the way through it. 10/10 The best teen flick Enjoy and please rate my review!,The Hot Chick
184,craig-mackay,Surprisingly good,8,6 March 2005,"I took my two pre-teen daughters to this film fully expecting to have to sit through a couple of hours of cheesy kids comedy, funny but for kids. (well it is Rob Schneider.... you have to expect funny!) But to my surprise this film is very good. Rob Scneiders portrayal of a girl in a mans body was superb and only exceeded by Rachel McAdams portrayal of a man in a beautiful girls body....she was fantastic. In fact her part as the man, while almost a sidebar to the main storyline, was the thing that took the film from cheesy to good. Rob, as always, was very clever and very funny. The way he does his physical humour is always good, I very much prefer his style to Jim Carey, who often makes me cringe. So to summarise... the film is really good and well worth seeing.",The Hot Chick
185,brownmojo7,Charming Anna Faris,8,9 April 2005,"Anna Faris is simply beautiful and adorable here. She really stole the show from Rob Schneider. This makes me a fan! She usually emotes by exhaling heavily. That's really sexy. However, Schneider held his own when it comes to his scenes. He was so good, I wasn't used to seeing Rachel McAdams playing the ""good"" Jessica Spencer. Schneider and Faris enjoy sizzling hot on-screen chemistry. Faris' character gazes ever-so-lovingly at her best friend in a ""new"" handsome form. The other actors offer so-so performances. But hey, this is supposed to be a slapstick comedy, right? Buy the DVD to see the galore of deleted scenes. Funny how they are excluded from the movie. The scenes are pretty funny.",The Hot Chick
186,Princessjessi83,Hysterical,9,6 June 2005,"This movie is hysterical. There is so many unforgettable lines and scenes in it. It is one of those movies you watch over and over again, mainly because you laugh at your reminders of you and your friends acting out the scenes like total losers. Ask someone if they watched it and if not invite them to. I guarantee it will become one of your favorite movies to share. Rob Schnieder amazingly portrays and young woman, and may I add he does it wonderful. There is so many male/female stereotype clichés that you can't help laughing at them. This movie is tastefully put together, think non-sexual and drug free. Grab a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the show!",The Hot Chick
187,atomiccrm,Love this movie and why everyone hate it?,8,12 April 2017,"Totally love this movie when I was a kid and now I'm 18 years old. I don't know why movie has so many negative reviews? Well, everyone's a critic including me. Always remembering the body swap spell between popular school senior Jessica and lowlife criminal named Clive. I've this a 8 out of 10. Atomic-CRM OUT!",The Hot Chick
188,sjlzboy,Matt Weinberg is a great actor.,10,29 August 2005,"Matt Weinberg is so great in this movie. I like him. He likes to make up himself as a girl in this movie. That's so funny! Why is that? Does he do that in actual life? But I think he is good looking when he appears as a boy. When he is eating his father's cake, do you see his expression? (he looks to the place where Jessica had been and turns to his father, he is very surprised.)Matt shows it excellently. And also he is very funny. And at last, when the family comes out of the house to the police car, Matt dresses himself like a woman with high-helled shoes. Because of that, he runs slowly, but his parents are very upset. So Matt has to hurry up. He is very funny! And when his sister is not at home, he will wear her clothes. And when he sees that man who is his sister hit by his father, he begins to know that that man maybe is his sister who is disappear. And once, he comes to the room where Jessica is crying. And he comes to comfort her. That's very moving. Matt Weinberg is a great actor. He shows that the boy in this movie is a funny, clever and a little poor boy. Why is he poor, you may ask. Because he is always hit by some bad boys in this movie. Anyway, Matt Weinberg will have more great movies in future. I like Matt. I will always support Matt.",The Hot Chick
189,crystal_clear_22,great movie,8,10 January 2006,"I remember how my little sister was so obsessed with this movie. She rented the movie one day, and made me watch it with her. She told me about the movie before, but it didn't really interest me. I thought that it would be real bad. However, after watching the movie I realized that it wasn't so bad. It was actually really good, at the beginning I wasn't interested, but after watching the whole movie.. it was great!! It has heaps of hilarious moments in it! I was just laughing my head off!!! now I saw why my sister loved it so much!! It's about this girl called Jessica who is like pretty much the most popular girl in her school, she's also a cheerleader. She finds these earrings at an antique store, that are a magic. She loses one of the earring, and 30 year old loser finds it, they both wear one of the earrings each, and they switch bodies, this is like the worst nightmare for Jessica, and its so funny, as you watch Jessica who is now a guy on a hunt for her body. I don't know how to explain it more, except that it a really great movie, my sis then made my parents watch and then they agreed that it was great too. It's not like the best movie in the world, but it was good enough for my sister to rent it SO many times that we just bought it for her to save money. I highly recommend buying it!! 8 outta 10",The Hot Chick
