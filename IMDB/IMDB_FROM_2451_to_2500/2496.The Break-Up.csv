0,TheLittleSongbird,"This isn't a terrible movie, it just felt a little disjointed",4,12 September 2009,"I didn't think this was a terrible movie, it just wasn't that great either. Vince Vaughan and Jennifer Anisten act well, and have decent chemistry. There is also a good music score, and some nice scenes towards the beginning. And towards the end, the film does manage to maintain your interest, and leaves you asking questions like how is it going to end. However, there are many elements that don't quite gel. One is the rather disjointed script, there were valiant attempts at humour, but instead of the hilarious rolling- about- on- the- floor sort of film, the humour just seemed to come in occasional splashes. Another problem was the direction, a bit too leisurely and uneven, also I did think some parts were underdeveloped, like there was a lot about Gary's job, but not so much of Brooke's. The pace was also a tad slow in places. Overall, could have been better with a more focused script, but some good performances and nice music, do make it at least watchable. 4.5/10 Bethany Cox",The Break-Up
1,SnoopyStyle,Unlikeable characters,4,16 November 2013,"Gary Grobowski (Vince Vaughn) is a loud mouth boorish Neanderthal who works as a tour guide in Chicago. Brooke Meyers (Jennifer Aniston) works at an art gallery and feels completely neglected by him. They fight and they break up. Only neither of them are willing to move out of their luxury apartment and a war of the sexes ensues.He is an insensitive idiot. It's not a new character for Vince and it's getting tiresome. She's a high maintenance girlfriend disguised as the girl next door. Again it's not a new character. They are not likable characters and I'm getting tired of the actors doing the same thing over and over again. They don't make for a good couple, and they don't have good chemistry. They should never be together in the first place. The only good thing is that they don't get back together.This is meant to be a comedy. But there is too much serious anger and hate to be funny. It had a chance of this being a dark comedy, but nobody here could figure out how to make one.",The Break-Up
2,Horst_In_Translation,The epitome of forgettable romantic comedy,4,22 May 2017,"""The Break-Up"" is an American English-language film from 2006, so this one had its 10th anniversary last year. It was directed by Peyton Reed, who was in the headlines not too long ago thanks to the new Ant-Man movie. The script comes from Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender and for both of them, this 100-minute film is probably still their most known work. Which really says nothing positive in their favor. The reason for that is that this film we have here is the epitome of a forgettable romantic comedy. Most of the jokes aren't working at all and I personally found it difficult honestly to like any of the two protagonists, let alone cheer for them. It also proves than Vince Vaughn is not lead actor material at all and that Jennifer Aniston, no matter how much of a sweetheart and darling she may be, is no lead actress material either. At least if we go by 2006 standards. I have not seen her more recent work like the one film that she almost got Oscar-nominated for.Anyway, the story here is about a couple on the verge of split-up throughout the entire film and they are basically only still somewhat together because neither wants to give up on their amazing apartment. So what is the solution? Both give up on it. Doesn't make any sense to be honest. Besides, the comedy relies on stuff like Aniston's character running around naked after they basically split up already to get him horny and maybe agree to leave the house to get away from his ex provoking him, but not letting him get any. Or him playing video games for hours with her new potential boyfriends. It's just not entertaining. Quality actors like Davis, D'Onofrio and Bateman (actually all better than the leads) are wasted for pointless supporting characters that add nothing to the story, perhaps in a desperate attempt by the filmmakers to prove to us that Aniston and Vaughn are on a higher level. They may be bigger names, but they just don't have the range. Anyway, with the ending they probably tried to be creative and actually make a dramatic impact also with them actually splitting up as one could have thought throughout the entire film that they may get together again. But of course, they weren't bold enough to really go for it all and instead include an uninspired fake happy ending in which the romantically hopeless (I am not talking actual romantics, but just the desperate) can think that they are really getting back together in fact. Of course these are the ones who also consider Jennifer Aniston one of the best actresses from her generation. Four stars out of ten is still extremely generous for this really bad film. I recommend to stay far far away.",The Break-Up
3,mark.waltz,I wouldn't want to spend 10 minutes with either of these people.,2,5 April 2017,"A combination of misogyny and misandry, this shows a generation gap, a gender gap, hatred towards potential in-laws, and makes the man look like a fool while it makes the woman look like a passive/aggressive control freak. This comedy shows too completely incompatible people moving into a gorgeous apartment together without obviously really thinking it through. Jennifer Aniston, one of today's top leading ladies, has never warmed me on screen, and I found myself despising her from the start. She's the type of female (certainly no lady) who expects the men in her life to read her mind. According to her state of confusion, insisting that she feels cut flowers are a waste so that means that she really wants her man to buy her flowers. Vince Vaughan is no prize either. He's guilty of being a slob, not offering to help, and when he agrees to do the dishes, she's angry because he didn't offer. But my biggest issue with him is that I did not find him at all believable, speaking lines that seem to be the most one dimensional viewpoint of the world's biggest misandrists.Perhaps modern relationships haven't improved with the E.R.A., and the vengeance of angry broads vs. the one upmanship of male chauvinists determined to keep control. This is not a couple that I'm rooting for to see get back together, let alone go out on a date in the first place. She's got a strange family that seems like they are from outer space. Even mom Ann-Margret seems like she dropped in from another world in her few scenes, although I never bought her as Aniston's mother in the first place. Judy Davis appears to be playing the Patti LuPone of the art gallery world, rather severe and sadly wasted. The effeminate receptionist is also a rather unnecessary character as well, stereotypically overly sensitive and flamboyant, basically a gay cartoon character.This is trying so hard to be hip, modern and current, but only proves several points according to the script. Straight men are insensitive pigs that need to be trained and controlled by the women they date. Their women are harpy's, manipulative and demanding, not worth the psychological risk of a lifetime of angry stares and immediate confrontations once the door is closed after company leaves. I found myself yelling at the screen in frustration at the one dimensional modern way that humanity has turned the battle of the sexes (funny in old screwball comedies) into something that looks like a Fifth Avenue parade right after the crowd has dispersed. I watched the entire film to get the whole picture, one of the ugliest pictures of male and female relationships I've ever seen.",The Break-Up
4,claudio_carvalho,Delightful War of Sexes,7,16 December 2006,"In Chicago, the art dealer Brooke Meyers (Jennifer Aniston) feels not appreciated and neglected by her immature husband Gary Grobowski (Vince Vaughn), who is partner of his two brothers in a tourism business, and decides to break-up with him to make Gary misses her. Gary misunderstands her true intention, both follows the wrong advices of family members and friends, beginning a war of sexes with no winner.""The Break-up"" is a surprisingly good dramatic comedy, showing a delightful war of sexes between a young couple that is misguided by family members and friends. The story is well constructed, has many funny moments, it is never corny and has a wonderful conclusion, different from the usual clichés of Hollywood movies. The charming and gorgeous Jennifer Aniston and the nice Vince Vaughn show an amazing chemistry and have great performances with an excellent cast, and Judy Davis is unrecognizable in the role of Marilyn Dean. The alternate ending in the Extras of the DVD is simply awful, and could have spoiled this good movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Separados Pelo Casamento"" (""Separated by Marriage"")",The Break-Up
5,kosmasp,Not another romance movie,5,6 May 2007,"The premise was really nice, although the movie was more hyped for the alleged romance between the two stars here! And that's an off-camera behind the scenes romance. Because in front of the camera they had to play mostly otherwise (the clue therefor lies in the title of the movie!!).Since I'm not much into the finding out, what celebrities do or what they don't do, I can't tell you, if the two of them are together or got together at all (you'll find it somewhere in the internet). But I can tell you that the nice premise, seeing a relationship breaking (again the clue is in the title, so no spoiler here), is interesting. But what they make out of it, isn't neither fish nor fowl (in terms of the movie that translates into neither comedy nor drama).",The Break-Up
6,jboothmillard,The Break-Up,4,4 October 2009,"From director Peyton Reed (Yes Man), I had seen some bits and pieces of this relationship comedy from trailers and review programmes, so I had to give it a go. Basically, in Chicago, art dealer Brooke Meyers (Jennifer Aniston) meets Gary Grobowski (Vince Vaughn, also writing and producing) at a ball game, and through a montage you see a series of photos of them having a great love for each other. One day though this changes when Brooke feels unappreciated and neglected by immature Gary, being partner in his two brothers' tourism business, deciding to break-up with him. She is sure he will miss her, and he is misunderstanding this intention, and so begins a small war of the sexes, Gary trying to do all the things Brooke wouldn't allow to get on her nerves, and Brooke trying to grab Gary's attention in whatever way she can, e.g. walking around completely naked. With no real winner int he battle, they both decide a real break-up would be the more sensible, and sad, thing to do, but they do have a little reunion in the end, and you never know what could happen next. Also starring Joey Lauren Adams as Addie, Jason Bateman as Riggleman, Vincent D'Onofrio as Dennis Grobowski, Jon Favreau as Johnny O, Cole Hauser as Lupus Grobowski, John Michael Higgins as Richard Meyers, Peter Billingsley as Andrew and Justin Long as Christopher. Vaughn and Aniston are quite good as the troubled couple, there is are some amusing moments, Aniston naked (you don't see anything, but it doesn't matter) is a highlight, so while it isn't the funniest film ever, there are some things to be liked. Okay!",The Break-Up
7,moonspinner55,"Sufficiently raucous...but also incisive, funny and honest",8,4 December 2008,"A Chicago tour guide and his live-in girlfriend, an art gallery seller, have a messy split, but neither wants to leave their condo. Viewers expecting a wacky romantic comedy with lots of nutty behavior will pretty much get what they want for the better part of an hour. Yet, this surprising film has a tough, edgy undercurrent that brings forth a great deal of relationship truths--enough to resonate deeply with the rest of us wanting a little more substance. Perhaps it is because of the film's 'simple' framework that serious cinefiles shunned it (the picture may appear to be a mass-market entry initially), however it caught me off guard with an apparently desired, serious need to be more than just a skin-deep star-throwaway. Jennifer Aniston is quickly becoming the most underrated actress of the past 10 years; several of her big moments (whether crying in her room, catching her ex in the middle of a drunken orgy, or just trying to sort out her feelings while on the job) are flawless. Vince Vaughn is equally good, and the pathos he manages to convey near the end obliterates the movie's sitcom set-up. Instead of a wild free-for-all, the film manages to be funny in a prickly way, never losing sight of its characters and never condescending towards the audience. Without going into unnecessary, hokey background detail, it shows clearly how little hurts and upsets can erupt into life-changing decisions, and those who recognize these people will clearly understand and sympathize. It's the best relationship movie in a long while. ***1/2 from ****",The Break-Up
8,blanche-2,Bleh,6,15 February 2009,"Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn are going through ""The Break-Up"" in this 2006 comedy-drama that also stars Judy Davis, Ann-Margret, Jason Bateman and Vincent D'Onofrio. Vaughn plays a funny guy who is in the Chicago city tour business with his brothers. Aniston is his girlfriend, who works in an art gallery. The two live together in a beautiful condo. We see them when he meets her for the first time at a ballgame; the next time we see them, she is throwing a dinner party, and he isn't helping out. They break up not long after.I'll just cut to the chase on this one. I wasn't disappointed that it was advertised as a comedy and had dramatic moments. I thought the acting was fine. Vaughn has good delivery, and Jennifer Aniston is a likable actress. There were great performances in good roles by Vincent D'Onofrio, Judy Davis, and Jason Bateman. And there were some very funny scenes.At 1:47 minutes, fifteen minutes could have been cut. The movie dragged.Now for my real problem. I read a few reviews on this board, and only one person mentioned this. Why the hell would a bright, well-read, good-looking woman with no end of intelligent, well-read, attractive men asking her out allow herself to be in a relationship with the selfish, irresponsible, nearly Neandrathal slob Vince Vaughn played? I can see that he was a funny guy, and they had good times together - but that's it. And that's not enough. I never got from the Aniston character that she had no self-esteem, but to stay with this guy, and lay out his clothes, and cook, make plans for get-togethers, and do whatever he wanted - she must not have had any. The abrupt change in Vaughn's character was unbelievable as well.In short, I thought she was too good for him, and why she hadn't figured that out is beyond me. Just not a good script as far as characterizations and believability. The comedy sections were good, but the rest of the script just didn't hang together.",The Break-Up
9,ComedyFan2010,Great break up drama,9,10 June 2010,"I love this movie! I think the big mistake they made was to label this movie as a ""romantic comedy"". Because this certainly isn't a comedy. It is more a realistic drama with some funny moments. If they promoted it as what it is, the right crowd would go to watch it and people would have the right expectations. In this case it seems to me that people came to see some silly comedy.My only problem in this movie was that I have no idea why Gary and Brooke were together. And it isn't even because he liked football and she liked ballet, people can be different and still have a lot in common. But I just wonder how she could stay with someone who is so selfish and egoistical for 2 years? But besides that the movie is great. The fights are very realistic. I love the one at the end when Brooke is crying after Gary didn't show up at the concert and then finally tells him how hard it was to be with him because of his selfishness. This is when he finally understands it and tells her that she should have said it before, that he is not a mind reader. I love this moment. I took a relationships psychology class and one thing we learned was that disagreements in a relationship are unavoidable. It is how we deal with them that can ruin the relationship. And one of the mistakes is to expect the partner to be a mind reader. In this movie they both have made mistakes and both have grown. Their relationship didn't survive but at the end they both knew what their mistakes were.I was also happy that the movie avoided unnecessary romantic comedy clichés, including the happy end. I was really worried it will end with them staying together. Luckily they went the realistic road, Brooke and Gary separated but when they meet i the final scene you can see that they have forgiven each other, moved on and are happier now than they were before",The Break-Up

11,wes-connors,The Really Odd Couple,5,16 August 2010,"The synopsis for Universal's nicely-packaged DVD sleeve explains, ""Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston star in the charming and unpredictable comedy 'The Break-Up'. After two years together, Gary and Brooke's relationship seems to have taken a comical wrong turn on the way to happily ever after. Now the break-up is on, the lines have been drawn, and their honest feelings for each other are coming out. Get ready for an all-out war of the exes in this fun date movie that's hilarious and heartfelt."" The film starts with them at a Chicago baseball game, sitting separately. Apparently, this was their first meeting. Then, there are ""snapshot"" photographs showing their courtship, which we never see. Next, they appear to be married. As it turns out, they aren't married, but have bought an apartment together. He's a popular tour guide and she works in a snooty art gallery. At home, he plays sloppy ""Oscar"" to her neat ""Felix"". Can these two share a condo together without driving each other crazy? The main failure in ""The Break-Up"" is that Mr. Vaughn (as Gary Grobowski) and Ms. Aniston (as Brooke Meyers) have zero appeal as a romantic couple. A few scenes showing them happy might have helped - possibly, the opening ""snapshots"" were included to take care of this flaw. It doesn't work and probably never would have. Just break up, and shut up. Vaughn's tour speech, Aniston's blurry ass, and arty secretary Justin Long (as Christopher) are highlights. The best scenes in this ""comedy"" are when the stars are not sharing the screen together, and their supporting characters are much more entertaining than the leads.***** The Break-Up (6/1/06) Peyton Reed ~ Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Long, Vincent D'Onofrio",The Break-Up

OK, she's branched out a little into dramas, and some darker comedic far with 'Horrible Bosses' (which ironically was horrible) but 'The Break-Up' pretty much sums up the sort of film she's made her whole career.It's an average film that misleads you into thinking your getting a high class comedy, and then whacks you over the head with lots of dramatic moments.It's not half as funny or serious as it thinks it is, and that's ultimately why it's only an average film rather than a good one.",The Break-Up

Their confrontation endlessly fueled by mean-spirited suggestions of revenge tactics from friends and family and their stubborn refusal to budge resulting in an excruciating stalemate,they ultimately decide to spitefully stick it out as hostile roommates until the weaker party eventually admits defeat. As the competition to drive one another out grows increasingly intense and outrageous, however, Brooke eventually comes to the realization that she's not fighting for possession of the condominium as much as she is fighting to salvage her relationship with the man she once viewed as the love of her life.

16,jotix100,Breaking up is hard to do!,8,15 July 2006,"What do former lovers feel after they have ended a relationship and are suddenly thrown together by chance in a situation they can't just avoid? The answer seems to be what Brooke and Gary experience after a long absence when they run into each other and practically have nothing to say to one another. Both lives are changed irremediably, so it's best to move on in order to avoid the pain.One of the reasons we liked ""The Break-Up"" was that it was not a typical Hollywood romantic movie that capitalizes on two well known stars, Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, two likable performers in their own right. In the case of Ms. Aniston, it appears she is reliving her own pain caused by a separation that probably was something she, or her adoring fans would never in a million years would have thought possible.Director Peyton Reed's take on the screen play by Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender, with the help of Vince Vaughn, is the right one. Here we are looking at two people that never should have been together, making a commitment to stay together, that sooner, rather than later was bound to prove Gary and Brooke how wrong they were. In the case of Gary Grabowski, he is fundamentally a man who is into himself and can't see what Brooke's needs are. It's a fatal mistake most couples make when the physical attraction plays a bigger role in determining the way their relationship will be like.Gary is a man who wants to do things his way. He will never see things from Brooke's perspective, taking her for granted in many aspects of their life together. Gary's personality will not let him see what he had with Brooke until he loses her for good. Toward the end, when things had gone too far, he wakes up, but it's much too late. Like most guys, Gary doesn't want to part with his buddies and the way they did things together prior to starting the relationship with Brooke.Jennifer Aniston does good work as Brooke. Vince Vaughn is a bit over the top in his portrayal of Gary, which in a way was the right approach to make us understand this man. The supporting cast makes the film believable. Valuable contributions by Joey Lauren Admas, Jon Favreau, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jason Batesman, Judy Davis, among others, fit well into the action.The cinematography by Eric Edwards captures Chicago in all its splendor. The music score of Jon Brion plays well in the background that includes a nice array of popular songs. The film ends as ""I Can See Clear Now"", that seems to make a statement about all what we saw prior to this point.Unfortunately, a lot of comments to this site are downright negative because the film doesn't sugar coat what its main theme is and how two lives are changed forever, which is probably what the audience is not prepared to accept. Congratulations to director Peyton Reed in a film that probably will make more sense to some people if they would view it a second time.",The Break-Up

I must have picked it up 20 times and put it back down. I had to see it as I am one of those who is in love with Jennifer Anniston. I have loved her ever since she broke on the scene as Rachel in Friends. She so disappointed me in going off with that jerk Ross instead of Joey, but I still love her.She tends to make movies with losers like Ben Stiller and Jim Carey, and now Vince Vaughn.The movie did have Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio in addition to Aniston, so it wasn't a total loss.But, girlfriend, look at who you are starring with!

Except for the occasional good line from Vince Vaughn, the situations and the dialogue were very blaah. I was expecting some laugh out loud moments, but instead I got mostly angry tirades. This movie was definitely more along the lines of a dramedy because it really lulled and got serious at times.

19,george.schmidt,Anti-romantic comedy; Vaughn & Aniston make a cute couple; and they're good together on screen too!,7,2 June 2006,"THE BREAK-UP (2006) *** Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston, Jon Favreau, Joey Lauren Adams, Cole Hauser, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jason Bateman, Judy Davis, Justin Long, Ivan Sergei, John Michael Higgins, Ann-Margret, Vernon Vaughn, Peter Billingsley, Jane Alderman. (Dir: Peyton Reed)Anti-romantic comedy; Vaughn & Aniston make a cute couple; and they're good together on screen too!Vince Vaughn is one of my favorite contemporary American actors with his charming, in-touch with his inner-frat boy good-time Charlie spin on two of my other fave comic actors Michael Keaton and Bill Murray and Vaughn manages to make the persona of the affable jerky smart-talking lug his own shrewd niche ever since his outta-nowhere overnight stardom turn in ""Swingers"" a decade ago; I know I can't believe how time flies but that's a whole other soap opera.In his newest vehicle Vaughn enters the choppy waters of the rom-com (his official first and with a co-storyline attributed to the big guy along with novice team Jeremy Garelick & Jay Lavender, as well as producing) with for-the-most- part sure-footedness and finds a likable coupling with the also appealing Jennifer Aniston, whose own big-screen success has largely been to her accessibility as an EveryChick - the kind women like and guys want - who meet cute at a Chicago Cubs/White Sox expo game at Wrigley Field where motor mouth Gary Grobowski (V-man) is chilling with his best bud Johnny O (Favreau, refreshingly re-teamed with his so-money real-life chum and frequent on screen partner) and catching a glimpse of the fresh-scrubbed prettiness of Brooke Meyers (J-An) impromptu buys a round of ball park franks insisting she have one in spite of her being with another guy on a date (Gary clearly sees the guy as a stiff from the get-go by the fact the chump wears a 'visor' and has his polo shirt tucked into his plaid shorts!) and chats her up as the crowd begins to spill out post-game. This by the way is pre-credits!What follows next is the no-brainer high concept titular event where Gary's clueless EveryGuy-ness can't see the forest for the trees - namely taking for granted the love of his girlfriend who is fed-up with his seemingly unsuspecting feelings for her (namely doing something for her spontaneously and not having her to tell him so). The event percolates before a family dinner Brooke - an A- type personality if there ever was one - who micromanages her beau when he doesn't bring home the proper number of lemons for a centerpiece (his 3 for her 12, the magic number). Things only go from bad to worse during and after the meal when she attempts to get him to help her clean up when he simply wants to relax watching SportsCenter (hey, it's a guy thing babe!) From this point on war is declared in who gets the hip condo apartment the couple share and since both are stubborn to budge the pair enlist in a battle of the sexes (she has their bowling team turn against him and he has his much- sought-after pool table installed dead center of the dwelling). Can two people live in an apartment without driving each other crazy(ier)?That last question - the opening salvo of TV's version of ""The Odd Couple"" - can best sum up what occurs in the long run as the two try to one -up the other in making each other miserable to the point that one will HAVE to acquiesce and leave once and for all.What ensues is somewhat predictable yet occasionally laugh out loud funny (i.e. Gary getting his ass kicked by Brooke's flamboyant brother Richard (the always welcome Higgins), after she 'allows' him and his acappella group (The Tone Rangers!) to rehearse in her bedroom (after Gary made abundantly clear the previous night as her own safe personal space where all systems go) but by the third (and surprisingly thudding) final act I was left a little pole-axed. I realize the title of the film pretty much sums up what is going on but I thought that it seemed to me that Brooke was just being pettier than Gary by simply not explaining in plainspoken English how unhappy she was being treated. Then again if that were the case there'd be no movie. I get that. But Gary simply likes having a good time, kicking up his shoes and playing video games until dawn. I get that too. That seems to be the problem with these two crazy kids; not getting each other until it's too late.While the stars have chemistry and a fine ensemble - including an underused Bateman as their Realtor friend who intervenes by laying down the ground rules to their situation; the always welcome Davis as Aniston's boss, an art gallery diva who cares (well, just so much); Adams as Aniston's married-with-children girlfriend who offers some advice at the drop of a hat; and Hauser and D'Onofrio as Vaughn's brothers/partners in business, a budding Chicago tourist group - the storyline could've used more juice in the competitive sport of breaking each others' balls ; instead it cops out with one of the least-appealing endings since ""Forces of Nature"" (and trust me that is saying a lot!) Director Reed lets his couple act up a storm but seems to lose the comic/romantic rhythm in the process. Don't get me wrong, it's funny and witty and clever with some heart in-between but I was expecting more of a message than Vince Vaughn Grows Up (I don't want that to happen) and Jennifer Aniston Needs to Lighten Up (I think she has in real-life now that the stars are aligned so to speak).",The Break-Up
20,ferguson-6,Who Loves Ya' Baby?,5,4 June 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. The trailer is definitely misleading as this is most certainly not one of Vince Vaughn's patented low-brow comedies. Instead it is a peek behind the curtain of a painful relationship break-up between Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston. Few films actually deal with break-ups in a real life manner, but the argument that happens right after the parents over for dinner scene near the beginning of the movie is all too real.The ensuing emotional chess match between the two characters (and the inclusion of their friends) is not comfortable to watch, but does offer some insight into our foolish actions in these situations. As is the case most of the time, poor communication is at fault here ... plus Vaughn's character has a little too much frat boy in him for his advanced age.Vince again delivers the goods and his one-liners are present, even if they do not over shadow the dramatic plot. His comfort with Aniston and buddy Jon Favreau (""Swingers"" co-star) are obviates and his love for Chicago is a bonus in his scenes at Wrigley and giving the city tours.Aniston looks her best after some serious pitfalls in her last few films. She plays the role straight and the film is better for it. The rest of the cast does a fine job including a remarkable turn by Vincent D'Onofrio (far from his simmering roles in ""Law and Order"" and ""Thumbsucker""). I wish someone would explain how the great Ann-Margret has somehow been reduced to roles more suited to Candace Bergin. Judy Davis is perfect as the eccentric artist whom Aniston works for and don't miss Peter Billingsley (film legend as Ralphie in ""A Christmas Story"", he also co-produces here). A special treat is a brief glimpse at a live performance by Rhett Miller and the Old 97's.Director Peyton Reed (""Down with Love"", ""Bring it On"") seems to have a feel for the woman's side of relationships, but I do wish Hollywood would be brave enough to promote films for what they are.",The Break-Up

Tour guide Vince Vaughn and art gallery patron Jennifer Aniston confront differences threatening their relationship. Great background information followed by a routine seesaw battle of wills. Conclusion received a groan from the audience as director Payton Reed tries to deliver on two scales. Reed previously made the successful yet routine Bring It On. Vaughn argues his messy lifestyle, while Aniston yearns for appreciation. Vaughn is unsympathetic because he fails to do simple things that could help heal his relationship wounds. Aniston is also unsympathetic reducing herself to failed attempts to make him jealous. Standard friendships with Vincent D'Onofrio and Joey Lauren Adams who are deserving of better material. Plus we have Cole Hauser as Vaughn's brother and this is quite the step down after having the lead in Paparazzi. Strong message regarding admitting our faults but some relationships are doomed from the start, much like this film. The concluding scene is perhaps meant as a twist but it comes off like a kick to the groin. Disappointing comedy that won't have viewers breaking up. Score: 4 / 10",The Break-Up
22,HotToastyRag,Pretty ordinary rom-com,4,12 June 2017,"Real-life (at the time) couple Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn starred in a movie called The Break-Up. Did neither one of them think that was a bad idea? In the movie, they play a couple who break up but still cohabitate in the same apartment. There's a few funny jokes, and it's not the worst romantic comedy in the world, but it's not the best, either. Aniston isn't really given much to do, and Vaughn is given his usual free reign on his microphone. If he doesn't usually annoy you, and you like Aniston when she coasts through a romantic comedy, you'll make it through this one.As usual, I'm not giving any spoilers, but I really like one of the endings. Included in the DVD is an alternate ending, because the studio found the original ending didn't test well. I won't tell you which one I liked, but you can rest assured there's an option in case you're not happy with the end.",The Break-Up
23,movieman_kev,proof that a film doesn't have to be romantic to be a chick flick,4,7 May 2007,"Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) have a typical relationship argument which spirals out of control causing the Break-up the title refers to. This film might have been on to something if the leads had that special chemistry. Vaughn and Anniston quite obviously do not. How can the viewer relate to this scenario on a emotional level, if one can't believe they were in love in the first place. As a consequence the crux of the film just all falls apart. There are some laughs to be hard at the start of the film, but this is more an uncharismatic chick-flick drama more than anything else. While the film is reasonably acted, and competently directed, there's no clear reason to see this film (Jennifer Anistons exposed rear not withstanding) My Grade: C-",The Break-Up
24,gradyharp,Enough Already!,3,18 October 2006,"THE BREAK UP is one of those tiresome 'comedies' that Hollywood grinds out on the basis of star power. In this case the star power begins with a story written by Vince Vaughn (along with Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender), suffused with the same Vince Vaughn that is the 'character' for all his films, and the DVD ends with an extended loquacious justification for the film given by - who else? - Vince Vaughn. It is as tedious and boring as the actor himself, though legions of fans of potty mouth slapstick over-the-top loud-mouthed 'humor' will doubtless disagree.Peyton Reed was brought in to control the overacting of the Vaughn character and actually is able to allow the other actors in this tired story a chance to shine. The story itself? Vaughn and the superb and beautiful Jennifer Anniston meet clumsily at a Chicago Cubs baseball game where Vaughn introduces the overbearing obnoxious beast that he is in the first few minutes of the 'courtship'. The courtship and marriage of these two people is contained in snapshots during the credits, sparing us form that extended episode. When the film actually begins we are already in the midst of a relationship on the skids: Vaughn (a bus tour guide for Chicago with his two brothers Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio) and Anniston (an art gallery person working for the kinky and fabulous Judy Davis) live in an elegant condominium which becomes the landing pad for a breakup of their tenuous marriage. It is a case of who can out gross who, all the while supported by mutual and individual friends. Anniston wants to feel appreciated; Vaughn is insensitive and irresponsibly immature. How it works out is the only good thing about he film: it doesn't! There are some fine little cameos for folks like Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Favreau, the above mentioned Judy Davis, Jason Bateman, Justin Long, Ann-Margret etc and they do what they can to add a bit of lustre to this venture, but it is the tedium of watching fighting between two people for 105 minutes that drags the picture down. The reason for 3 stars? Jennifer Anniston who continues to prove she can overcome almost any bad script and make it watchable. Grady Harp",The Break-Up
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Break-Up,6,23 August 2006,"The real life relationship between Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston probably casted a cynical shadow over this movie, given its ominously sounding title about the end of relationships. Not that it's played out in an unbelievable manner, but this is a classic case of real life causing an unwanted effect on reel life.In a courtship that spanned up until the end of the opening credits, that's familiar grounds to the real/reel couple as we see them so utterly in love with each other. And it's not before long that the lack of nine lemons became the spark of a heated, long drawn argument. It's the littliest things that always matter and provide the catalyst for unwanted trouble, and the lack of appreciation somehow almost always provide ample ammunition to the start of a cold war.This movie had the effect of trotting the fine line between the two parties, though I must say that I stand on the side of Aniston's Brooke, rather than Vaughn's Gary. Perhaps that's because I've weaned myself off video games. Anyway, from a spectator's point of view without taking sides because of sexes, her requests (if you call them that) seem reasonable enough, in any relationship which is about give and take. So if you were to ask me who's right or wrong, I've already made my stand.But while the movie dwells on the confusion of the situation made worse by a common living space and mortgage (money has to do with everything, no doubt), it's some same old grounds that many romance movies had already tread upon, exploring the pain of breaking up and losing someone you had taken for granted, except that because of the premise of this movie, it had to be played out in a more extensive manner. It takes a long look at the games people play to get back at each other, and the saying of things that you don't really mean in the heat of the moment, the skewing of meanings, and the explosion after keeping what you abhor about someone inside you for so long (that's for keeping things under the carpet during good times). There's also quite a realistic take on the running to friends and family for emotional support, and the difficulty of being caught in the middle of things especially when you're friends of both.Between the two leads, the pain of the break can be most visibly seen in Jennifer Aniston, and there are no doubts as to where she could have drawn the strength from to play her emotional wrecking scenes. Vince Vaughn again looked like he sleepwalked through a role (not that it mattered, given the character), but I thought that his portrayal didn't really bring out that tinge of regret or believable sadness at the whole event.Can you become friends with the person you broke up with? Probably. How deep that friendship can be will depend on the circumstances behind the breakup, and of course how willing each party is to bury the past and carry on as friends. It could be in an extreme superficial manner, which I would think now, why bother at all?The city of Chicago provided the backdrop of another recent movie - The Lake House, in a story about love and hope. Here, it turned the other way and became the city where love and hope had faded, and those who have undergone a break up of sorts can experience the bittersweet aftertaste. Did I mention the almost unrecognizable Justin Long's awfully fugly take as an effeminate co-worker? Ewww....",The Break-Up
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not your typical romantic comedy, which was a good thing",7,17 October 2006,"I wasn't expecting much from The Break-Up, not to mention the pretty harsh reviews on this film from IMDb, I was pretty scared. But I saw the trailer again for this film that it was being released on DVD and I have to admit that I was extremely curious. After all, this was a huge deal being shot in Chicago! Over all, I'd actually say that The Break-Up was a funny and cool film to watch.Gary and Brooke have been a great couple, they get along great and have great chemistry, they also live together. But time has taken it's toll on the couple and they break up, the problem is that they're fighting over who will move out first. Another problem, both want to get back together, but have too much pride to admit it, so they play pranks on each other until they just end up destroying each other's feelings.The ending was a little... well, I don't want to give it away, but it was more realistic than other typical romantic comedies. Give this one a try, it is funny and not to mention just over all a good movie. Vince and Jen made a cute couple and did great together in The Break-Up.7/10",The Break-Up
27,blanbrn,Funny and interesting romantic comedy but ends on a dull note with no answers.,4,2 June 2006,"After just watching Break- Up I felt the film done it's best to show the conflicts of male-female relationships, and how both are different during break-ups, but this film failed to show a happy ending of a couple getting back together in the end therefore it disappoints as a romantic comedy. I must give the film credit Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Ainston are good and seem real as a Chicago couple who share a condo, only to finally clash over little differences, and both refuse to move out, while each take advice from one's friends and family. The movie shows during the break up the guilt and lonely feelings, but mostly you see the clear gender differences between them it seems like the relationship was really never real. And never did I find any real closure as most romantic comedies end happy with the couples getting back together after a break-up or struggle, but in this film it doesn't happen as both characters go apart. So I was surprised when I expected a happy romantic comedy with a cheerful ending if anything I took this film's meaning to show the gender differences between male and female and that many times our differences are so much that our love can't keep some couples together. Break-Up is OK but nothing great you will be OK to pass on it.",The Break-Up
28,KineticSeoul,Bickering is the main theme of this film,5,17 February 2010,"This film is about how 2 couples end up breaking up, one is a annoying child the other plays the bossy mother figure. People seems to like Vince Vaughn but soon they both end up acting like a child all together, no wonder they end up breaking up. And than they spend most of the film trying to get back at each other and both of them are not willing to back down. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston were okay, but it feels like they could have been replaced by many other actors and actresses. But I must say the fighting and griping between 2 adults in a childlike manner was a bit amusing to watch. Anyways I found Vince Vaughn's character was more of a prick though, not trying to sympathize with the females although Aniston's characters family is a bit more awkward, because Vince's character made the move on Aniston's character when she had zero interest in him in the first place. Some people may compliment how it's portrayal of love and relationship not always being sugars and rainbow being a good thing, but that is just pushing it. The film starts off okay, but starts to get tedious and drawn out. It does have it's moments though, but after a while you just can't wait for them to just break up and meet new people because the bickering just gets way too old. Picking a side wasn't difficult for me either Team Aniston all the way and the ending was somewhat decent although it leads to more questions than answers.5/10",The Break-Up
29,theowinthrop,An adult film with comic edges,8,24 December 2006,"This movie is going to enter the area of Hollywood Legend because of the background circumstances that mirror it's theme. I am referring to how Jennifer Aniston's marriage to Brad Pitt collapsed (apparently) after the latter made the film MR. AND MRS. SMITH with Angelina Jolie, and Pitt and Jolie's subsequent romance blossomed into a marriage with children both conceived and adopted by the parents. Ms Aniston subsequently made this film with Vince Vaughan, with whom she too would have a relationship (that now seems to be over). Since this film is about how relationships between couples fail through non-chemistry or miscalculation or misunderstanding, the film seems to mirror the Aniston - Pitt - Jolie triangle. Oddly enough, that is the one element of such dissolutions that does not appear in this film. Although all sorts of escalating confrontations occur (including a couple of dates Aniston goes on) there was no real triangle for either of the two principles.THE BREAK-UP begins with Vaughan at a baseball game with his closest friend (Jon Favrreau - a man who if there is any possibility that a person is doing something for a good reason or a hurtful reason, will always figure out it is for the hurtful reason). He sees Aniston at the game, and is really struck by her - in fact he gives her one of six hot-dogs he buys so that he can talk to her. Eventually he coaxes her into going out with him for a drink. Soon a series of still photos show how they seem to be on the right wavelength for being married eventually.But it's all surface unity. While Aniston is into some sports (baseball and bowling) she is also rather artistic. Her family happens to be from academia, and she works in an art gallery. Her favorite sibling (her brother) is a member of an all male chorus of harmonizers. It turns out that Vaughan does not think well of her family (which he probably thinks looks down on him). In particular he considers Aniston's brother (John Michael Higgins) a closet gay man - something Aniston keeps denying. Vaughan and his two brothers run a tourist bus company, and are planning expansion for a tourist boat, and hopefully a helicopter as well. Vaughan is the guide, and is usually exhausted when he gets home - too exhausted to follow simple requests, like the purchase of a specific number of lemons for a dinner party.The dinner party is the point where the schism between Aniston and Vaughan begins to widen. Aniston feels Vaughan lacks any true feeling for her efforts - he rarely volunteers to assist her. Vaughan feels that Aniston does not appreciate his hard working schedule (although he keeps ignoring her hard work at the art gallery owned by Judy Davis). So we watch as Aniston refuses to have anything to do with Vaughan (hoping, in his loneliness he will return with contrition), and Vaughan escalates to undoing various things about the apartment that Aniston was opposed to (watch the business about the pool table), and then the division of the apartment into his and her sections, and a no-man's land for helpless guests. Soon it also involves their friends on the bowling team and on game night...well you can see the threads of the relationship just split apart like a fat man putting on an old army uniform.It is actually a sad story of two people, who for all their anger do still care for each other, but who through mistiming and intentional explosions of anger wreck the possible reunification of their lives together. Yet, at the end they are both aware of what their stupidity has caused - so that there is no hard feelings at the conclusion. It was a pretty good look at people fumbling at a lasting relationship, but growing up in the end. If the Aniston - Pitt - Jolie business helped to create this project, something worthwhile came out of that love triangle.",The Break-Up
30,Robert_duder,Completely misrepresented...but also a poignant and intelligent look at relationships,8,6 June 2006,"I have loved or at least liked many a film that IMDb reviews trashed severely. I am a little perplexed about reviews for The Break Up on IMDb which have been WAY less than favorable. However I am convinced it is simply because this film is one of the worst represented films in history. To tout The Break Up as a romantic comedy is the WORSE decision ever. This is NOT in any way shape or form a romantic comedy, it's not feel good, it's not sweet or loving...instead it is a very intelligent, well written, off the beaten path film about the reality of a relationship. To call The Break Up stereotypical?? The Break Up is so far from the typical ""romantic comedy"" since that is what they classify it as. Now after reading that don't steer clear of this film...just go into it with a completely different set of expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised.Vince Vaughn co-wrote and stars in The Break Up. Now Vaughn can do drama we have seen proof of it. However he's much more apt to do comedy which is why we expect it from him. Nonetheless Vaughn plays a normal, down to earth guy in Gary Grobowski. He's the blue collar man and I think every guy who sees this film will attach himself in some way to Gary. Sure Vaughn has some funny, sarcastic moments (majority can be seen in the trailer) and then he has some intense moments of sincere dramatic dialog that literally almost made my jaw drop. It just feels so real. Jennifer Aniston plays his long time, live in love interest Brooke Meyers. Aniston is not quite as earthy as Vaughn is, but she tries. Unfortunately I think her character comes across as needy, bitchy, whiny, and not altogether likable by the time it's over but perhaps that's my perspective as a male. She does have some emotional and intense speeches but is sincerely overshadowed by Vaughn. They are cute together but don't quite come across as realistic as they could have. The film takes the two of them from the beginning of their relationship, shows us stills of their blossoming romance and then jolts us into the current situation which has the two of them nearing the end of their relationship.The only hint at this being the typical recipe for a romantic comedy is the attempt to add the supporting characters who are ...the ""friends."" Joey Lauren Adams plays Aniston's best friend Maddie who Aniston always goes to for advice every time something happens with Vaughn's character. Adams gives her advice and her wisdom but is mostly a rather empty character. Charismatic Jon Favreau plays Vaughn's buddy, the over-the-top anxious, violent Johnny O. His character seems out of place at times in the dramatic element but he is funny and has some great one liners. Jason Bateman, continuing to try and be a member of the Frat Pack, does a good job in a very small role as the couple's friend and Realtor Riggleman. He's funny but Bateman can be funnier and the role was quite small. Vincent D'Onofrio (who I used to always confuse with Vaughn) plays Vaughn's uptight brother Dennis. He seems almost manic at times and his role is pretty small as well but he does a good job. And back up frat packer (much like Bateman) Justin Long plays Vaughn's flamboyant co-worker Christopher. He sticks out like a sore thumb and really doesn't mesh with the story but the writers really tried to create some wacky side characters. The only really notable performance of a wacky side character is the role played by John Michael Higgins as Aniston's brother Richard. I recently saw Higgins perform a hilarious role in Jiminy Glick. He is a talented comedian and this role is very funny. It's small but effective and he makes the most of it. Finally worth mentioning is the veteran talent in the film. The incomparable two time Academy Award nominee, and nine time Emmy Award nominee Judy Davis as Aniston's boss Marilyn Dean. Dean is a self proclaimed Diva who really has a big heart underneath it all and although her role is small as well she immediately ups the class of the film with a slightly offbeat character that definitely gets a few chuckles. And finally in a smaller cameo role the amazing two time Academy Award Nominee and five time Emmy Nominee Ann-Margaret as Aniston's mother. The best scene is with the entire family around the dinner table and Richard has everyone break into a chorus of impromptu instruments...hilarious.There are absolutely some funny moments in The Break Up. Unfortunately 99.9% of them can be seen in the trailer and everything else is simply not funny nor is it meant to be. The funny moments mostly come from real life situations that you laugh at because they are real. This is a movie that makes you remember and laugh and watch this couple go from in love to friends over the course of time. It's not about their condo or doing things to each other to try and get the other out...it has nothing to do with that despite being represented that way. It's about their emotions and feelings and the course of time following a break up including an attempt at reunion. In a day and age where films always show us the Happily Ever After it was almost refreshing to see a real perspective of a real couple. For those who say people who love each other don't do mean things to one another....blow some more smoke....couples separating can be downright cruel. I say Bravo to all the writers and director Peyton Reed but BOO to whoever decided to market this the way they did. They could have a really nice drama with a hint of comedy on their hands. See it with a new perspective, you'll be blown away. 8.5/10",The Break-Up
31,bowmanblue,WARNING: This is NOT a romantic comedy,6,28 May 2014,"Some actors get typecast pretty quickly. I think it's fair to say that Jenifer Aniston is one. She readily plays the lovable, kooky happy-go-lucky characters in a will they/won't they romantic relationship (and let's face it - they always do).I don't normally watch romantic comedies. I find them predictable and identical (and rarely are any of them worthy of the 'comedy' half of their labelled genre). I was curious about The Break Up because I heard it didn't subscribe to romantic comedies' formula. And there's a very good reason for this - that is because it's NOT a romantic comedy.Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn get together in the opening montage and break up about fifteen minutes into the film. I knew this before I watched it. Therefore, what I expected, was roughly another seventy-five minutes of laughs as the two central protagonists make each other's lives hell.However, what I got was simply two people being nasty to each other. Sadly, this is probably a lot more realistic than most rom-coms, and, upon watching it, I think I'd rather stick with the fantasy of boy meets girl and they live happily ever after.The bottom line is that this film is more of a drama than a comedy - the jokes are few and far between. The scripted arguments may be accurate, but they're not that nice to keep watching. It's quite sexist too. Jenifer Aniston may be a bit uptight, but Vince Vaughn is a berk. The hardest thing to imagine is these two characters getting together in the first place and staying together long enough to even buy a house, let alone fight over who should keep it once they've split.Bottom line - yes, it's more 'real' than a romantic comedy, yet it has less comedic elements than even the most unfunny romantic comedy. It certainly doesn't stick to the rom-com genre. For the first time in my life I find myself saying 'Pity.'",The Break-Up

Brooke and Gary have been dating a while and finally move into a fabulous apartment. Soon, they start to argue. Brooke can't take the fact Gary is so non-appreciative of the work she does and when she asks him to do something like help wash dishes, he won't do it. He's too interested in video games. After calling it quits they do things to make each other jealous. Brooke goes out on dates. Gary plays strip poker with hot girls at their apartment. Neither of them wants to leave the apartment since it is a great location. Brooke gets Gary kicked off the bowling team because she knows he loves it. Gary gets a pool table, something Brooke would not allow. And Brooke finally realizes it is over when Gary doesn't show up at the concert.It's just not the type of depressing film most people want to see. And the advertising makes you think it is comedy since Vince Vaughn stars, but it is not funny at all.FINAL VERDICT: The plot isn't that great.

Thus begins a cat and mouse game, with each partner seemingly throwing out signals that perhaps a reconciliation would be nice. But, then, Gary buys the new pool table he's always wanted and installs it in the dining room and Brooke starts lining up new gentleman to take her on dates. Is the break-up going to be forever? This film is funny yet fully able to elicit tears as well. Aniston and Vaughn are very, very good as the mixed up couple. The secondary players are also quite nice, from the supportive sister, Joey Lauren Adams, to the scene stealing art gallery owner, Judy Davis. Speaking of the cast, will someone please give IVAN SERGEI, he of incredible looks and charm, a leading role somewhere in American cinema before he ages another day? Sergei is a dream as a possible date for Brooke. The scenery shows Chicago off at its best and the costumes compliment everyone involved in the film.

34,tabuno,Commendable But Flawed Movie,6,22 January 2019,"4 August 2006. It is very difficult to find the right balance between comedy and drama, particularly when the trailers suggest that this movie is strictly a romantic comedy that turns out to be more drama than comedy with a significant dose of raw humor thrown in. The chemistry between the leads was never solidified and the ending is more of an attempt to look sophisticated. There are scenes of humor, yet the movie is uneven and not balanced between being funny and being serious. We even get a gay-like art receptionist.The movie's concept is good but its execution seems heavily weighted on this game people play. Strangely the realistic ambivalence in any breakup does seem to come across, probably too much so. There is, however, a roughly consistent storyline of the break-up focus, yet the sharp drama, the more sublime humor is missing.",The Break-Up
35,Floated2,Quite enjoyable,7,10 November 2018,"There have been several romantic comedies which have seemingly came and went and seemed to be forgotten. The Break-Up was quite a success at both arguably the peaks and primes of Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston's career. They deliver great performances and the chemistry shows throughout which is the main reason as to why this film worked as it does, as they both make it more enjoyable than need be. Vaughn is funny in his deliver and mannerisms and Jennifer Aniston is quite lovely, and although unlikable at times, the character works.With little knowledge of the film expect remembering hearing about its success years ago, one was cautious of watching as many romantic comedies tend to be overly try-hard funny, or too emotional and romantic, and predictable.The Break-Up feels quite different in sense though somewhat feels as a plot for a television series. What is quite good and different in the film is that it doesn't try too hard at being romantic and lovely. And within the end, we see that a happy ending isn't always the most predictable one.Recommend for those not typically into the typical romantic comedies but something to be more relaxed in and not think too much.",The Break-Up
36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Hysterical and very promising, but strays a bit too much and does itself harm",6,5 June 2006,"Movies that claim to be under the romantic comedy genre are supposed to be just that, a funny story that despite some conflicts along the way results the way everyone wants it to: happily ever after. ""The Break-Up,"" partially written by and starring the silver screen's currently most trendy funnyman Vince Vaughn along with Jennifer Anniston, sells itself as a slightly funnier and less romantic formula-follower, but boldly takes up a path of its own by the end.The film comes right out of the starting gate with everything that is 'Vaughn comedy' and continues to do so for the majority of the film. Vaughn is at his best in this movie, with ramblings that surpass previous hit ""Wedding Crashers"" in wit and humor. While Anniston's character results in simply a sounding board for Vaughn's humor, she is at her best despite playing yet another victimized woman in a relationship not dissimilar to her role in ""Bruce Almightly"" in which she was also second to a male comedian in Jim Carrey. Together they assume the very clash of men and women in relationships, much different from the typical female-oriented romantic comedies, giving the movie a broader appeal and a chance to act as a milestone in the improvement and success of the guy-meets-girl romantic comedy, a genre waiting for its comeback since ""Hitch"" became the highest grossing movie of its kind.With Vaughn as the glue, the comedy sticks to a highly successful ""Crashers""-esque formula bringing in a handful of quirky characters such as Jon Favreau as Vaughn's best friend, John Michael Higgins as Anniston's comfort zone-violating, in-the-closet brother, and even Vaughn's ""Dodgeball"" co-star Justin Long as Anniston's extremely feminine co-worker. Vaughn and Anniston continue go back and forth devising different schemes in attempt to make the other feel jealous enough to want the other back. The typical formula has this ""war"" being followed by some drama, which the film does, but unexpectedly takes a turn at the end. It seems as if Vaughn and his co-writers were simply uninterested in sticking to the norm, but wanted to use the norm to sell the movie, resulting in a less than impressive deviation that is simply too difficult to believe, leaving viewers frustrated and dissatisfied despite the films promising first hour or so. Perhaps someday a romantic comedy focusing on one guy and one girl will come along and outdo this movie, but it would be impressive for it to have all the right tools for success that ""The Break-Up"" has.",The Break-Up

OK, not true! ""Vincenifer"" are still a romantic dynamic duo. They not only have chemistry together with their perky/gabby demeanors but they also have biology with their charming appearance, and physics with their garrulous entertaining motion mouths. So you see it's not rocket science to analyze the enjoyable attributes these two wonderful actors contribute to modern day cinema. Aniston has been quite a friend to the genre of romantic comedies with admirable performances in films such as The Good Girl, Office Space, Bruce Almighty, and Along Came Polly. While Le Vince keeps swinging comedic acting homeruns in such films as Swingers, Wedding Crashers, Dodgeball, and Old School. Aniston and Vaughn deliver astounding performances in ""The Break-Up"". Vaughn stars as Gary, an egoistic Chicago Tour Guide who spends his leisure time watching Cubs games and playing video games. Aniston plays Brooke, an aspiring Art Dealer who feels neglected in her relations with Gary. Because of Gary's lazy and self-centered antics, Brookes breaks it off with Gary. However, none of them want to break away from their enchanting Chicago condo; so they are ""feeling separated"" but find conniving ways to make each other jealous to hope to reconcile, even though they are still in constant condo chaos by consistently arguing with one another. Brooke starts dating other men which Gary meets when they go pick her up, she gets a fresh body wax and walks naked to the kitchen to get a Coke while Gary desperately watches, and tells Gary that he must set up the food for their traditional game night with friends. Gary, on the other hand and other side of the sofa for that matter, has a wild session of strip orgy with voluptuous lady friends, sets up a pool table and invites his buddies to round them up, and even befriends some of Brooke's dates alluring them to play video games with him. ""The Break-Up"" also gets plenty of support from uproarious performances by John Michael Higgins as Brooke's overgrown choir aficionado, Justin Long as Brooke's overgrown art assistant homofianado, and the great Jon Favreau as Gary's overgrown best pal violenciado. It was a gem to see our favorite buddy ""Swingers"" Vince and Jon on screen together again , and once again they prove that these guys have it ""Made"" when it comes to male buddy talk in cinema. Director Payton Reed's realistic storyline on romantic turmoil and couple egoism & insecurities will ""reead' well by the general public with a high degree of relativism. Writers Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender's screenplay was broken up evenly with comedic and heartbreaking elements. However, even tough I do not want to take sides of ""The Break-Up"" this was really the ""Vincenifer"" show. Vaughn and Aniston's verbal magnetism is the talk of the town of the success of ""The Break-Up"". OK, now take a break from whatever you are doing and fight your way through to experience ""The Break-Up"". ***** Excellent",The Break-Up
39,smatysia,Momentum of its own,7,18 December 2006,"Not really a total spoiler, but I liked it better not knowing or suspecting the film's ending. You assume from the marketing and stuff that this movie is a formulaic Hollywood romantic comedy. It's really not. It ends up being a rather darker sort of film, a semi-psychological movie. It still has some amusing bits, and the stars did good work. Vince Vaughn played more or less the same character in Wedding Crashers. Jennifer Aniston continues to show some range. Her comedic talent was long established and she shows she can do the drama as well as anyone.About the plot; the main thing to keep in mind is that neither character really wants to break up with the other. But these things build a momentum that is very difficult to reverse, and that is the real-life point that the movie is making. I expected the obligatory romantic comedy, feel-good ending. Didn't get it. Which gave the film some power that it otherwise would never have had.",The Break-Up
40,davispittman,Mixed feelings about this one......,6,26 March 2016,"The Break Up starring Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn gave me mixed feelings. The beginning is solid, the dramatic scenes involving the break up were well done and very well acted by Aniston and Vaughn. They both did well in their roles here, they didn't have great material to work with all throughout the film, sometimes they did, but not consistently. The plot is pretty standard and can be clichéd at times, but it wasn't terribly clichéd. For me, the comedy and the laughs weren't really there in this movie. I did like the more dramatic scenes, but the comedic scenes and jokes just didn't really work. That's this movies biggest flaw. The ending was very smart and pleasing, I enjoyed it, it's an ending that not a lot in this genre take. 6/10.",The Break-Up

Seeing Jen's butt was nice in the movie,, i thought Vincent Donofrio's part should have been bigger though. I also thought that John Favreau was a riot in this one,, even funnier than Vince Vaughn , if that's possible,, i hated the character of Richard i'm sorry the guy was a total fruit. I liked the bowling alley scenes, very surreal. The condo which they share was a unique idea.. he has his ""space"" , and she has hers. I wasn't all that sad at the way the movie turned out. This is a great comedy, but also tells a very good story, about dating, and what couples go through during the process. I would definitely recommend this to anyone,, just one thing though,, couples should NOT watch this together, as i think it would provoke a big fight..",The Break-Up
42,EUyeshima,Wildly Fluctuating Look at an Embattled Couple Never Finds the Right Pitch,5,19 October 2006,"The most resonant moment of this mishmash of a film is actually its ending. It's not important to know how the story ends except for the fact that it captures well all those quicksilver feelings of contradiction one feels when confronted with a significant other. Unfortunately, the rest of the 2006 movie enervates far more than it enthralls, primarily because director Peyton Reed never seems to find the right pitch for the story of an embattled couple who separate but choose to live together in the Chicago condo they bought. First-time feature screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender make the primary mistake of trying to make the characters likable at the same time they are supposed to go for the jugular when it comes to the conniving game of one-upmanship each plays on the other.The focus is on Gary and Brooke, who meet in typical rom-com fashion at Wrigley Field. Right after a photo montage of the happy couple during the opening credits, we already sense tension between the two as they prepare for a family dinner party. The relationship falls apart quickly when Brooke recognizes man-child Gary will never change to accommodate her needs. This leads to a series of emotional blackmail episodes that bring moments of catharsis for the pair but at different times. The movie has some nice comedy elements and one-liners for about the first twenty minutes but then moves deeper into sad-eyed melodrama as what's left of the relationship spins out of control. The constant shifts in tone are especially awkward toward the end as the characters' mutual disappointments in one another grow tiresome and repetitive.Of the two leads, Jennifer Aniston fares somewhat better as Brooke since she does not bear the comedy burden that Vince Vaughn seems to feel as Gary. Aniston achieves moments of poignancy even though her character's manipulative nature is just as bad as his. Although he has some funny bits of business throughout, Vaughn struggles valiantly with the heavier moments, and the imbalance between the two actors becomes more pronounced as the story moves along. A stellar supporting cast has been assembled and mostly wasted. A pointlessly cast Ann-Margret has a barely-there cameo as Brooke's mother, while a gaunt-looking Judy Davis has the unenviable role of Brooke's ball-breaking, gallery owner boss.Under the radar since ""Chasing Amy"", Joey Lauren Adams plays Brooke's obligatory best friend Addie, and a now-grown Peter Billingsley (the cherubic Ralphie from the 1983 holiday classic, ""A Christmas Story"") is on very low wattage as her husband. Better in the Apple ads, Justin Long does what he can with the predictably fey role of mincing gallery assistant Christopher. As Brooke's a capella-singing, sexually ambiguous brother Richard, John Michael Higgins seems to have walked in from a Christopher Guest movie. Jason Bateman has a few funny moments as the couple's realtor pal Riggleman, and Cole Hauser (a dead ringer for his father Wings) brings out the oily swinger in Gary's younger brother Lupus. The best moments are provided by Jon Favreau as Gary's suspiciously connected bartender friend Johnny O and Vincent D'Onofrio looking stressed as Gary's straitlaced older brother Dennis.The DVD is chock full of extras - a making-of featurette, short films on Richard's singing group, the Tone Rangers, and the touring company owned by Gary and his brothers, and two separate commentary tracks - the first with Vaughan and Aniston (both displaying more charm here than in the movie itself) and the other a more straightforward account by Reed. An alternate ending has been included with separate commentary tracks by and Vaughn, all of which comes across as quite contrived. There are also several deleted and expanded scenes, as well as outtakes of varying quality. The last extra is a fitfully funny improv scene between Favreau and Vaughn.",The Break-Up
43,MarieGabrielle,Hype does not a movie make...Vaughn gets sole credit for comic relief...,4,14 June 2006,"although it does perpetuate mediocre talent and public curiosity, which may be the only reason people are curious about this film.Actually, Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau again team up for some of the comedic scenes, so this is not a complete disappointment. If you like VV you may enjoy the first hour of this film; after that it descends into predictability, strained comedy, and gay stereotypes from the 80's.Vaughn gets sole credit for adding any substance to this film. And I do mean ANY. Vincent D'Onofrio, a good actor, is wasted in an inscrutable part, a deranged older sibling who runs the tourism business in Chicago with Vaughn. There are some awful scenes- REALLY awful, at the dinner table where Ann-Margret is also present, I did not hear one person in the audience laughing.Judy Davis is a welcome diversion from this mess, but her cameo as an eccentric art gallery owner is not long enough. Aniston plays her usual self; which may be good or bad, depending on what you think of her personality. Joey Lauren Adams is also a one-dimensional character, trying to help her sister find Mr. Right.Apparently, the director did not want this to be construed as a ""chick flick"" so added Vaughn, and a few male characters, without developing the characters, or giving them any substance.There is a brief scene with the ""Old 97's"" in concert, Vaughn has a few dramatic moments, and the plot could have worked, but the screenwriter must have been under a time limit, or creatively challenged.Overall, this film is a disappointment which could actually have worked, had there been any creative thought put into it. 4/10",The Break-Up

There is very little to recommend, and one wishes it could have come with a money back guarantee. Neither Anniston or Vaughn qualify as stars, and this film needs plenty of charisma in order to avoid sinking into disgrace. The script is weak and full of clichés. tiresome, and sometimes it even feels like it is designed to antagonize its audience.It is very difficult to take sides with any of the parties in this ""romantic mess"" when neither one of the characters or actors is able to even evoke any sort of sympathy from the audience. Anniston looks beautiful but appears unable to project any type of emotional reaction, except for disgust (could it be she was thinking of how awful the script was?). The biggest disappointment is having Vaughn sleep walk through his own screenplay and come across as someone who is not worth befriending, much less loving.I must admit that it was nice to see Ann Margret. Other than that avoid this one like the plague and if you must see it, wait until the DVD is on sale in the bargain bin. Even then you might paying too much.",The Break-Up
45,Enchorde,Average comedy with some good laughs,6,5 November 2006,"Recap: Gary, a popular tour guide in Chicago, and Brooke, a art-gallery saleswoman meet at Wrigley Field and soon have an amazing relationship. But slowly they grow apart, grow tired of each other. And suddenly, after on late night argument, they finally break up. But they don't move out from each other, they stay in the same apartment and soon compete in ways to annoy the other one.Comments: It's both an new romantic comedy and one that runs in the same tracks that all other has. The new idea about this one, and this is about the only new idea, is that this romantic comedy pictures the other end of a relationship than the movie usually does. The ending, the break up. Otherwise, as I said, it plays very hard on stereotypes and clichés and doesn't add much new material or ideas. Still, it is rather fun, and I did laugh pretty much. But it was the same old jokes, still funny, but the same old thing.Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston is the couple, and do it well. But nothing spectacular, and the best dialog in the movie is between Gary and his friend Johnny O, played by Jon Favreu.Other than that there is not much to say. An above average comedy, but not much else.6/10",The Break-Up
46,triple8,was really really good-at first....,6,11 December 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:This movie is NOT the disaster I went into it, thinking it would be. The Breakup actually starts off being very good and surprisingly on the mark in how it shows the deterioration of a once loving relationship. But unfortunately it kind of unravels.First the good. I LOVED Vince Vaughn in this. I don't think I have ever been to the point where I'd call myself a major fan of his, not even after seeing the hilarious ""Wedding Crashers"". But this movie did it. He is a very talented guy and does both drama and comedy very well which isn't that common to see. He also has a down to earth charm a ""regular guy"" kind of quality that suits him perfectly for the role of Gary-a guy anyone could stumble across at a certain moment. Vaughn was great and so was Anniston.This on screen couple have CHEMISTRY. It's unfortunate that the movie didn't choose to showcase ANY of the good times in their relationship so one doesn't see a lot of that but their very convincing and you can buy into the fact that they are-or were-or are-in love. You can buy into it even without seeing almost any of the good. Anniston puts in a great performance and is really coming into her own as an actress. I wasn't reminded of Rachel once. (I Still say nothing she's done has touched ""The Good Girl"") but this is a role she definitely throws herself into.It's a pretty serious movie but I didn't mind that. Very reminiscent of ""War Of The roses"" which I absolutely hated but I really did start out liking this a lot and watching it is surprisingly pleasant even with all the shouting. The strength of the movie is it's ability to show the everyday normal problems a couple can face-sometimes it's not the big things that can screw things up, it's the over saturation of to many little things being ignored until they culminate into a big thing.The movie showed that so well. I liked the human aspect of the movie and liked Vaugh and Anniston.But the movie loses it toward the end. It's known that Anniston's character doesn't really want to break up with Gary. No, what she wants is for him to pay her some attention and want to help out etc etc . So-at last-he does. And what does she do? She leaves him! Well-she kinda sort of leaves him-she just doesn't feel it anymore-so they part ways after all-until they meet up again awhile later and it's implied they might get back together after talking for about five seconds. Then the movie ends.There is no believability in anything that happens from the time Gary asks for another chance. Actually, Gary changing so suddenly isn't all that believable either but Vaughn is so convincing in the role that one can kind of go with that. But her brushing him off like that-no WAY did I believe that. Normally I would praise a movie that chose not to take the conventional route to a sunny and perfect Hollywood ending but I can't in this case because a sunny ending would have made more sense. These two people did not want to break up. They still had strong feelings for each other and their final breakup was so unconvincing I couldn't believe it.And the chance meeting at the end was almost more unbelievable if such a thing is possible. So Gary tells her all the things she has been wanting to hear and she walks out on him but running into him for a second convinces her she wants to get back together. (I realize the movie never SAYS they get back together but it's certainly implied.) But the point is-that wasn't believable either. It seemed more like an attempt to please the audience after breaking them up a few minutes before. But if the movie makers wanted to please the audience and have them stay together why did they break them up in the first place? Is anyone getting dizzy yet? So I'm giving this a 6. Normally I don't strongly recommend movies unless their a 7 or 8 or above. In this case, I will say I think one might be pleasantly surprised if they go in thinking this is the worst movie ever made which I did. (because I'd heard such horrible things about it.) But I could see a lot of people thinking the first half is better then the second and feeling cheated at the end. Maybe a sequel is needed so one can see what the heck ever happened with this couple. My rating's a 6.5 of 10. An OK movie that could have been great.",The Break-Up
47,ctomvelu1,"It's a drama, folks",5,3 March 2012,"What a strange movie. Here I was expecting a romantic comedy based on the title and casting, but what I got was a watered-down drama, a WAR OF THE ROSES minus any hint of dark humor. Vince Vaughn and Jen Aniston play an unmarried couple living together in a condo. She breaks it off with him, and it is clear the condo has to go. But Vaughn's character is not crazy about the idea, and things get pretty unpleasant. I like Aniston., but she doesn't have the chops to pull off a dramatic role. Vaughn has always been an acquired taste for me, and his loud, oafish ways actually serve him well in a role that calls for that sort of fellow. There's a teeny bit of class warfare going on here: Aniston's character works in an art gallery while Vaughn's character is a tour bus guide. At least the filmmakers didn't go for the predictable, last-minute save ending that ruins so many romantic comedies. In a strange sort of way, the ending reminded me of the ending of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT. Watch it through to the end, if you can bear it, and hopefully you'll see what I mean.",The Break-Up
48,Matt_Layden,This Stuff Passes For Comedy These Days?,3,31 December 2006,"After a nasty break-up between Brooke and Gary, the two decide to try and make the other's life miserable, in hopes of keeping the apartment. Gary doesn't see things unless they are blatantly said or put right in front of him, so he can't tell that Brooke still wants to be with him. All she wants is for him to appreciate what she does. Does Gary learn this in time? Or will he lose her forever?Wow, see how the plot description went from something comedic to something dramatic in a matter of seconds, well that is exactly how the film plays out. After all the controversy surrounding Mr & Mrs. Smith, the so called big guys behind the desks in Hollywood decided to try and score money with the re-bound. Jennifer Aniston has a movie too, and look she is with a new guy too, it's Vince Vaughn...and he was in Mr & Mrs. Smith. Oohhhh, the controversy: Go see the movie. That is what I heard every time I saw something advertised for The Break Up. Still to this day I hear them and after watching the film I can see why. It's because it's a piece of trash.Why did Vaughn associate himself with this material I will never know, but not even he can save this film from the terrible crash it was heading for from take off. With an awkward opening you can tell immediately what you're in for. A money grab film that if it weren't for the two main actors in it, would probably never see the light of day. Vaughn plays his usual fastball comedic style, but it falls flat a lot of times, especially when he says anything remotely funny, you realize you already saw it in the trailer. Aniston had comedic timing down pat on friends, but that was with the character of Rachel, here she has nothing, does nothing and accomplishes nothing. She is pretty much useless. Aniston does nothing to try to go above and beyond the material, Vaughn at least tries. Here she gives minimum requirements and collects her paycheck, then watches as the media spins everything and then she has a hit on her hands. Not even the supporting cast can save the film. Other then the one or two times I smirked at Vaughn, arguing with the kid online was decent, the only saving grace would be Jon Favreau. I guess being long time friends with Vaughn paid off in this flick because their chemistry is the only thing that works. Joey Lauren Adams is the best friend and Justin Long is dreadfully annoying as the ""is he gay"" assistant. Bateman who usually gets a laugh out of me, 95% of the time it was on Arrested Development, again, sorry to say, adds nothing here.Will you laugh? Probably not, the first half of the film tries to be funny, but guess what, that's right you got it, you've already seen it. The second half is drama and it hits you out of nowhere, much like Click does. This is it's probably and it suffers, just like Click did. It had no idea what type of film it wanted to be. A romantic comedy? comedy/drama? They should have thrown in some kind of horror element and maybe I would have enjoyed myself a bit. If you have Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston in your cast, who are both very funny people, you need to use them to their full potential. Hell, if the Break Up used them at even half, or a quarter of their potential, maybe we wouldn't have such a travesty on our hands.Am I suppose to connect with either of these characters? Are the males suppose to connect with the guy in this war? Ditto for the women? I don't know and nor do I care. When the ending came, which tries to be different but just ends up being a cliché, you see it coming a mile away. Then the final scene jumps on us, to try and tie things up. Guess what, I hate to tell you it, but it really doesn't. They seemed to just rush an ending at us. Hey they meet again say what they've done and walk off. at least it has something in common with the opening scene, it's just awkward.So in the end, skip on this flick. If you see it on the shelfs in the stores, do someone else a favour and destroy that copy. Yes Jennifer, Baby want twelve lemons, but hey this baby wants his time back.",The Break-Up

The character Gary is annoying and selfish and both Brooke and he try to get attention to each other in ways that ALL couples would be hating each other for the rest of their lives. I am glad that at least the end of this movie is a little more original and the city they filmed is not New York or Los Angeles, two very predictable cities in American movies.Brooke and Gary start to have serious problems in their relationship, and Brooke decides to break up with Gary, her boyfriend that is lazy and selfish. But when the idea about selling their beautiful apartment is given, they decide to make each other's life a living Hell to stay with the apartment.

People demand quality for their hard earned dollars, and in this weak economy, will no longer tolerate churned out junk like ""The Break Up."" Romantic comedy? This twisted mean-spirited outing is not the least bit funny, except maybe to a sadist who enjoys pulling limbs off of small animals. Two bitter creeps, to no one's surprise, end up hating each other. They constantly fight over everything imaginable, making themselves and each other miserable, as well as everybody else around them. The misery extends to the audience; listening to these two abusive jerks is grating from the get-go, and it just gets worse and worse as they go along. Endless fighting served up as humor? Where once movies depicted love and relationships as pleasant even if not perfect, now this movie just spits on the idea of experiencing anything beautiful in life.Call this approach quirky. Call it real life. Call it honest. Call it post-modern. Call it anything; but by any other name it would still smell just as vile. Jennifer Anniston needs to pick better scripts; her career is faltering badly. She tries to work with this hateful script, but fails. As for Vince Vaughan, he reminds me of that guy we all knew in college that never bathed. The guy who bad-mouthed girls, because he never had a date. The guy who left dirty underwear all over his mosh-pit dorm room. The sooner Vaughan drops off the radar, the better off the movie industry will be.There's a reason this failed with critics and at the box office. It's because it's just so very bad.

She's resistant at first,but gives in. Flash forward two years,and they are living together,but they are reaching the breaking point. Soon,it takes very little(i.e. he buys three lemons for a centerpiece instead of twelve,her brother makes him uncomfortable at a family dinner,he doesn't want to do dishes,etc.)and the relationship is kaput.Here begins The Break-up,a story that is sold as(hence my subject summary line)a comedy that moves like something lighter than it actually does. There are plenty of good lines in this film,the actors(particularly Vaughn,Jon Favreau as GAry's bartender buddy,Vincent D'Onofrio as GAry's nebbishy brother and business partner and John Michael Higgins as Brooke's ""LOves ta' Sing!"" brother) are pretty well cast,but this is painful to watch. As the warring ex-couple continues to up the ante on their battle to push the other out of the spacious apartment they share,their friends,family and even prospective new relationships become uncomfortably caught in their vitriol. To be honest,I think I started sharing their feelings as the film rolled along.Director Peyton Reed and screenplay writers Jay Lavender and Jeremy GArlick make a film that is nowhere near as clever or fun to watch as its sold. Still,it seems like the film is made with a good sense of how real couples will play mind games in the run-up to and/or wake of a split. The tag-line says ""Pick a side"",but to me,that seems to be pretty short-sighted. What we have here is a game where plenty of offense will be played,but nobody really wins. At least if you're watching this from the outside,you can laugh,wince,cry,squirm,contemplate without feeling like you too have been involved in an acrimonious split or lost anything.

52,napierslogs,Good emotion in this break-up,9,11 July 2010,"When I first saw ""The Break-Up"" I was expecting your standard romantic comedy, but what I got was just a little bit different and it actually moved me.The first parts of the movie are fairly typical, you know exactly how the girl (Jennifer Aniston) and the boy (Vince Vaughn) are going to behave, but it's still funny. And we also got to see enough of these characters that they weren't as thin and underdeveloped as your usual romantic comedy heroes and heroines.Most of the actors, especially Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Joey Lauren Adams, John Michael Higgins, and Justin Long (huh, casting department must have something for 'J' names), are all great comedic actors, so they effortlessly add comedy to pretty much every scene. That makes breaking up much easier to take.What I particularly enjoyed about ""The Break-Up"" is that it just tip-toes the line of predictability. You think you know what happens next, and you are almost right, but not entirely. That combination heightens the sense of comedy and heartache. I watch ""The Break-Up"" every time that it's on TV because it pulls emotion out of me in just the right way and the right amount.",The Break-Up
53,jaredmobarak,The Break Up,4,22 July 2006,"The honor has been bestowed upon me to talk about movies for our blog. No need for fanfare, however, as our premiere is not one to write home about. Yes, we begin with the underachieving Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston (the conjoined pet name eludes me) vehicle The Break Up. Curse the trailers for having me say to myself, ""save the date of June 2 for that one."" I should have seen the warning signs; I know this now. The film was directed by Peyton Reed of Bring It On fame. Wow, that one should have put the nail in the coffin right away. However, he was involved with TV's cult favorites Mr. Show and Upright Citizens Brigade, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Most glaring though, was the PG13 rating. This is usually the kiss of death for a comedy of this kind. It starred Vince Vaughn, I thought if anyone can make PG13 seem R it's him. But alas, he couldn't.With a cast this top-heavy on names, (some falsely calling it a ""Frat Pack"" film, untrue because of the omissions of Ferrell, Stiller, Black, Piven and Wilson Bros.), you'd think the humor, which starts off blazing, could be sustained. Instead we get to the point where Vaughn's fast-talking, witty banter turns into loud, obnoxious, rehashed insults. The movie hits a lull during the middle stanza and rather than become comic genius, just ends up falling into the paint-by-numbers romantic comedy we see Hollywood churn out every week.Most characters are underused. Ann-Margaret says thank you for the paycheck, Joey Lauren Adams is a far-cry from her brilliance in Chasing Amy, Vincent D'Onofrio is basically there just to advance a plot point, Cole Hauser has one funny moment at a night club, Justin Long is humorous playing a flamboyant secretary (gets old fast, though), and Judy Davis is wasted in a part where her role's ego could have allowed for more laughs (she also looks just plain scary, as age didn't do her well in the 9 years since I last saw her in Deconstructing Harry). The supporting actors each get maybe 10 minutes of screen time for one-dimensional roles that only serve as a quick laugh.Aniston is the leading lady, but really just a support herself for Vaughn's antics. Vince is center-stage and, in my opinion, just can't pull through for an hour and a half. He is the consummate scene-stealer in other performers' vehicles, but falls flat when he needs to lead. Surprisingly, Jon Favreau does his best Vince Vaughn by owning every scene he has. The guy acts like a champ, making us laugh even when we are checking our watches during the final act. John Michael Higgins also comes through, especially with his rendition of Yes's Owner of a Lonely Heart.Overall the starting laughs are great. However, you don't pay theatre prices for less than half a movie. Wait on this one until it comes to video in 5 months or so. Instead check out great understated and nuanced performances from Vaughn and D'Onofrio in last year's dramedy Thumbsucker, or revisit Vaughn's breakthrough role as he delivers on a Favreau penned script in the great Swingers, (""Watch me make Gretzky's head bleed for super fan 99 over there""), so money it knows it.",The Break-Up
54,ODDBear,Uneasy balance between drama and humor,6,17 July 2006,"The Break Up is one of those drama/comedies in which the balance between humor and drama co-exist very uneasily. Sometimes the humor is nearly slapstick and a few moments later hardcore drama ensues. At times you nearly feel uncomfortable watching this relationship go to pieces and then the film asks the viewer to laugh out loud a few minutes later.I'll admit I'm much more of a drama guy than a romantic comedy one. Here, the bittersweet twists and turns of their break up had much more of an impact on me. Vaughn really delivers a top notch performance when playing it straight and near the end you not only understand him better (doesn't mean I liked him) but nearly start to feel a bit of sympathy for him. And the film really makes some good comments about the give and take aspects of relationships. Aniston, who's pretty much a specialist in these kind of roles, is very believable as the person who's simply had enough and can't go on.I found the humor to bring down an otherwise excellent drama film. Sure, some scenes are pretty funny and some comments by Vaughn are pretty much on the mark, but it's so hit or miss and for that sake alone the impact of the film missed me. Some very stupid characters are introduced and then they exit the film with amazing suddenness. You kinda' get the feeling they were just thrown in there to be in the trailer.All in all, The Break Up had some good moments.

55,fwomp,Vaughn's Strongest Performance To Date,6,11 November 2006,"The Break-Up is not a comedy. You'll find very few laughs. But it is a somewhat touching romantic drama with a surprisingly strong performance from Vince Vaughn (WEDDING CRASHERS) and a fine job by Jennifer Aniston (RUMOR HAS IT).Gary Grobowski (Vaughn) and Brooke Meyers (Aniston) meet at a Chicago baseball game and fall head-over-hearts for each other. They buy a condo while their relationship punches ahead at full speed ...until the brakes are applied with deadly force during a dinner with friends and family. Gary forgot to buy enough lemons for the table display and all of the irritants that have bothered both of them come tumbling forth.As their relationship disintegrates, one-upmanship is employed by the two fallen lovebirds; Gary buys a pool table for the dining room and Brooke starts dating other men. Neither can afford to move out of the condo so it is eventually put up for sale.The relationship falls to such a level that it appears completely unsalvageable. When Brooke extends an olive branch, it is unknowingly knocked aside by Gary. And once Gary realizes that it WAS an olive branch, it's too late to grasp.Strong bit parts by the quirky Vincent D'Onofrio (THE CELL), Cole Houser (PITCH BLACK) and Jason Bateman (DODGEBALL) help pull this rather pedestrian dramatic film up a notch. Even Ann Margret (VIVA LAS VEGAS) has a fleeting film moment that is noteworthy during the infamous dinner scene.The downside is that there's no hallelujah moment in the film, which is somewhat of a letdown. While comparisons to THE WAR OF THE ROSES (1989) are evident in the The Break-Up's premise, The War of the Roses was most definitely a physical comedy with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner doing horrible things to each other, trying to do more bodily harm than psychological. In The Break-Up, Aniston's and Vaughn's characters are still distantly in love and the harm comes when each refuses to budge in order to get the relationship back on track.The drama of The Break-Up is almost dripping with subversive anger as the two characters force friends to take sides, bitterly fight over the smallest of tidbits, and generally run slipshod over their once prosperous lives. And although we've seen similar films with similar themes, the one thing that helped give this flick a more positive rating was that it didn't slip into cliché at the end.There is no happy ending for them. The question as to if they'll ever get back together is left in the air, like so many true-life relationships. That there is personal growth on both their parts (most notably on Vaughn's character) is an added bonus that is touched on towards the end.",The Break-Up
56,cultfilmfan,The Break Up,7,3 June 2006,"The Break Up is about a couple named Gary and Brooke who after a night of fighting decide to sell their condo and move on to other things. The truth is though that Gary and Brooke still like each other and they both have people over and try to make the other jealous, so that they will end up back together. The Break Up has good comedic performances by it's cast and there are a few laughs to be had. The film is a generally entertaining film and one of the things I liked about the movie was that it was believable and not just a cliché divorce style romance movie like we have seen before. The situation and the feelings and decisions these characters make are realistic and true to life. Having said that I'm not trying to spoil the movie but it isn't exactly a Hollywood ending and as I said above that is one of the things I liked about the movie, but it would probably turn some viewers off. The Break Up isn't a classic comedy or as good as the recent American Dreamz or last year's Wedding Crashers (also with Vince Vaughn) or The 40 Year Old Virgin, but there are still some laughs to be had and the movie is generally entertaining and I enjoyed myself, so I will give the movie a recommendation, but it may not be what all viewers expect or want. That being said I hope people who do see the movie keep an open mind and are not all that big on false Hollywood endings because otherwise this movie will be ruined for you.",The Break-Up
57,Ruskington,The rarest of beasts- a genuinely good Hollywood rom-com,8,1 August 2020,"In amongst the conveyor-belt of dreadful and repetitive Hollywood comedies, I finally found something of actual quality. What separates The Break-Up from the usual claptrap is the fact that it has a thoroughly believable love story at the centre of it. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston both give career-best performances (in my opinion anyway) and the terrain of a relationship breakdown is explored delicately and authentically. There was an episode of Friends where the relationship between Ross and Rachel comes to an abrupt end and the quality of acting from Anniston and David Schwimmer was exceptional. The Break-Up is kind of like a movie-length version of that episode.On top of that, there is plenty of good comedy without all the toilet humour and sex jokes that plague these type of rom-coms. Vaughn is the only member of the infamous 'fratpack' who has any actual comedic talent and it shows here.I also love the way the story wraps up which is refreshingly realistic. The writers chose not to take the expected route and the film is all the better for it. If this movie was a piece of foreign cinema with unknown actors, I'm confident it would be rated an awful lot higher.",The Break-Up
58,Danusha_Goska,Die-hard Romantic Comedy Fan Attempts Suicide at Screening,2,3 June 2006,"I'll take a bullet for romantic comedy. I love romantic comedy. This film is further proof, if proof were needed, that the genre of romantic comedy has been the victim of Hollywood Hit men.IS IT SO HARD to create emblematic, witty, likable characters? Characters similar to you, or your friends, but prettier, richer, and more articulate? IS IT SO HARD to draft scenes where real issues real people really face are acted out in illuminating, amusing, arousing ways? Why could Golden Age Hollywood do this so reliably: Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, and today's writers and directors appear to suffer from some horrible genetic condition that makes it impossible for them to give us one believable second of magic? I can think of only one reason for the average viewer to see ""The Break Up."" There is a funny scene, that feels improvised, where two men talk about putting a hit on another man. It's a mildly funny scene that lasts of couple of minutes. The rest of the movie has no point whatsoever.""The Break Up"" is being marketed as a romantic comedy. There is not a single second of romance. If you went to this movie with the most desirable person you could imagine, you would not want to kiss that person after watching this movie.And, except for the above ""hit man"" scene, it is not comedy.What ""The Break Up"" is is a TV-quality, reasonably accurate portrayal of two badly mismatched people going through a dismal, depressing, all too drawn out break up. Their fights are believable. They are fights you've seen before. She doesn't feel appreciated. He just wants to watch sports on TV. For this you paid for a ticket? You could watch your in-laws going at each other.Jennifer Aniston is as beautiful here as she's ever been, and that's quite beautiful. Her character, Brooke, is a cipher. She's manipulative and teary, but otherwise, neither Brooke nor Aniston is given a moment to shine. She does nothing interesting. In comparison to Brooke, Rachel, Aniston's character on ""Friends,"" was a Shakespearean part.Vince Vaughn, as Gary, is given much more to do. He yells, he pouts, he schemes, he reforms himself. He is NEVER attractive. Vince Vaughn is about seven feet tall and he has the facial features of a man four foot eight plunked way down on his monstrous skull. This is a good face for comedy. This is not a face for romance, and Vaughn never makes it one. Please, please, please, somebody, never cast Vince Vaughn as the lead character in a romantic comedy again, unless the woman he's cast against is as unattractive as he is, and the plot has some heartwarming twist about unattractive people finding each other.The director, whose name I'm working to forget, brings to mind that age old question: Who did she do to get this job? The writers? Please don't tell me people were paid to write this.Oh, why was this movie made?",The Break-Up
59,jpschapira,Another regular film with the charming Jennifer Anniston,6,14 July 2006,"At first I wanted to see this comedy because of Vince Vaughn, but then I thought about all of Jennifer Anniston romantic comedies: ""The Object of my Affection"", ""Along Came Polly"", ""Rumor Has It""; and realized that they always have something missing, and I never really get to detail what. ""That sucks"", I said to myself; because Anniston looks so pretty and is so talented that you want a movie with her in the cast to be good.""The Break-Up"" is her last effort in the genre. Anniston plays Brooke, a lovely and caring woman who has a relationship with Gary (the now leading actor Vince Vaughn). They live together and currently they fight all the time. They break up, but stay in the same apartment. He gets drunk with his friends, she makes him jealousDo they deserve each other? Do they love each other? The movie is funny enough to get the viewer engaged for more than an hour. But the fun comes, I guess, from the actors. This is a movie that you must see with your couple, or with another woman. Everything Vince Vaughn says is going to make you laugh and everything Jennifer Anniston says is going to make her laugh; but I doubt this would be so with other actors in their roles.It's not Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender's first full-length screenplay (with a story by the writers and Vince Vaughn) what highlights; it's the main stars' expression. I heard something about Anniston being emotionally involved with Vaughn; it's true she's too good for him, and they don't have the right chemistry together, but ""The Break-Up"" doesn't need the chemistry.The supporting roles matter so little in this movie, that the actors playing them would have made the same impression if they had been other actors, unlike the main roles. Generally, romantic comedies require of the lead's best friend in a supporting role, to give him/her advice and to make the audience laugh. Jon Favreau, with all of his charm, doesn't complete the task here; neither does Cole Hauser or Joey Lauren Adams on the other side.Jason Bateman puts some freshness on the table, Vincent D' Onofrio is totally underused. The best supporting appearances come probably from actors that usually get a role in Vince Vaughn's films (or Ben Stiller's or Will Ferrell's, there's a movement there); Geoff Stults (Peter Krause) look-alike gets many laughs as one of Anniston's dates and Justin Long (""Dodgeball"") gives the viewer a good time with his long hair and gay style. So the film has essentially too much to offer but obtains too little results.Peyton Reed was in charge of the direction. The man, who directed the very good but underrated ""Bring it on"" and the good but overrated ""Down with Love"", now stands in the middle, with a regular film that not a lot of people will remember. Three theatrical releases, three different resultsReed's camera is responsible, you see? He's one of those guys who want to get it done right. Maybe taking a chance or a risk could be helpful.",The Break-Up

61,rebeljenn,forgettable,3,29 July 2006,"'The Breakup"" is a film about an unlikely couple who share an apartment and who end up breaking up. The film follows their break-up and their behaviours during the break-up. The film does succeed in providing some funny material, but all of it is mainly forgotten as the film drags on with the same material. In short, it gets old quickly. The other problem with the film is its difficulty expressing why the characters should be together because they are so different, and I was amazed that they survived long enough to get an apartment together.In short, the film lacks substance, but there are a few areas that are funny. Overall, I think that there are much better romantic comedy films, and this one does seem to drag on and on with its loss for different material appearing quite quickly in the film.

63,oneloveall,A popcorn flick with some actual feeling,5,7 June 2006,"This is a decently entertaining movie, specifically for couples obviously, that is both fun, observant, and slightly introspective of the male/female dichotomy, while still presenting itself as a popcorn flick. For the most part we coast through Vince Vaughn's continuous film streak of improv laden dialog. For males in particular, to say Vaughn is the sole reason to watch this movie is a pretty fair assessment, as it is his never-ending knack for keen improvisation that steers this film from detached formula to somewhat believable human situations. Previous film's such as Wedding Crashers and Old School have shown this lead actor's rising comedic abilities, which has apparently ended up giving him a certain carte blanch when delivering his lines, that can definitely seem a bit overbearing and trying too hard at certain moments, but ultimately redeems the characters and situations from being just another uninspired, predictable Hollywood execution.",The Break-Up
64,Superunknovvn,Better than you think!,5,13 August 2006,"I didn't expect much from ""The Break-Up"". Lukewarm reviews and a cast that doesn't exactly stand for cinematic masterpieces made me hope for an amusing and stupid little flick at best. Well, ""The Break-Up"" is more than that I have to say. Unexpectedly it doesn't take the route of bad taste and over the top-jokes but depicts a relationship going sour in a humorous way (comparable to ""High Fidelity""). In its first 15 minutes the movie is realistic when it comes to the little set-tos between its two main protagonists, Gary and Brooke. I for one could really see myself in a situation like this one. And ""The Break-Up"" also shows how everything can go wrong, even though nobody really wants the relationship to end. Sure, there are elements that are only in there for comedic value: characterslike Gary's kind, but latently violent best friend or Brookes' annoying brother. It's debatable whether such elements ruin an otherwise very realistic drama or whether those things help to keep the movie from being overly bleak. Personally, I thought ""The Break-Up"" found the right balance between chuckles and bitter moments. In the end, I found myself utterly touched by the story. I really loved the ending (even though the final song was maybe a bit too obvious) and I think it's great that ""The Break-Up"" didn't turn out to be the usual Hollywood romcom. On a sidenote: I'm now trying to do the dishes more often.",The Break-Up
65,Isaac5855,An alleged romantic comedy that is not romantic and is not funny...,4,19 May 2007,"THE BREAK-UP is another incorrectly marketed romantic comedy, that like 2005's THE FAMILY STONE, turned out to be anything but the film it was advertised to be. This disjointed and odd film chronicles the end of the relationship of Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston). They meet in the opening scene at a baseball game and the bulk of their relationship is illustrated through photographs shown during the opening credits. What we see is the final days before the big fight where Gary and Brooke decide to break up, but remain roommates in the condo they co-own. Then the story segues into this WAR OF THE ROSES type battle to see which one can hurt the other more. The main thing that bothered me about this film is that the story is one-sided. I believe when making a film about a relationship, no matter what phase of the relationship, we should be able to empathize with both parties involved. In this film, Gary comes off as a victim of this cold manipulative bitch Brooke and it doesn't work. Vaughn's performance is solid but Aniston just comes off as shrill and annoying. There is a solid supporting cast including Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Justin Long, Joey Lauren Adams, and the divine Judy Davis, but even their presence fails to make this film entertaining. It's mean-spirited and unpleasant and the lion's share of the blame has to go to Vaughn, who produced and co-wrote this mess. I don't know what he was trying to do here, but it didn't work.",The Break-Up
66,qormi,Comedic Break Down,1,7 April 2007,"This film had potential. The first half was funny. The second half suddenly shifted from comedy to drama. The result was a waste of two hours. There was no chemistry between Vince and Jennifer on screen, so it's not surprising that their off-screen romance fizzled, too. The movie was a cliché-ridden stench. Vince Vaughn had the typical ""fun"" job you see in all the chick flicks. He spoke on a microphone to tourists on a tour bus. Jennifer Aniston's job was to stand around in an art gallery. Wow. Several eccentric supporting characters could have been developed, but the movie shifted to Vince and Jen. Jennifer Aniston seemed to spend the entire film in humorless cross-your-arms-over your-chest negative body language mode while pursing her lips. Why is her skin so orange? She looks like a Chee-to wearing a wig. The film ended on an ambiguous note, further reinforcing the fact that you wasted your time.",The Break-Up
67,DonFishies,"Mildly watchable for a boring afternoon, but otherwise a terrible disappointment",4,8 November 2006,"If it were not for the intense media frenzy around the film, The Break-Up probably would have came and went from theatres with a very tiny amount of viewers. But of course, this did not happen. It instead went on to make more than 100 million domestically, and is one of the most surprising hits of this year. But one has to wonder whether it was the media's coverage of the two main stars that helped the film achieve this monumental goal, or if it was the almost blatantly false advertising.I will just get it over with right away  this movie is not a comedy. It may have a few instances of smirking, and a minuscule amount of romance.The rest is drama, and plenty of it.Did the producers intend for that to happen? Probably not.Despite a good two years, Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) has decided to dump her boyfriend Gary (Vince Vaughn). While she tends to be the mature adult, Gary really is just a big kid and does very little around their condo to help her out. Following a bitter fight after a dinner party, Brooke and Gary attempt to try and one-up each other until the other leaves the condo, which will not come easily.Yes, this sounds like the makings of a comedy, and in a few instances, pays off. But like the old adage says, most, if not all, of the funny scenes were in the trailer. And when you see them play out on screen, they are not even all that funny. You can tell they are really trying for some laughs here and there (mostly from supporting players like Jon Favreau, Justin Long, John Michael Higgins, Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio as opposed to the two leads), but most of them just do not play out well enough to work. These are ideas that are clearly fully baked, but are not being realized to their full potential.What it works hard on instead, and fails at, is the drama. Aniston and Vaughn spend most of the film yelling or arguing with the other person, and they just do not seem convincing enough. I liked the realism of how hard the break-up is to both characters (unlike most mainstream films), and enjoyed seeing how they dealt with it too. But the realism just becomes downright preposterous after a few moments of watching the film. Some of the things they do are just too childish to jive with what the rest of the movie, and others are too mature. If these two characters really loved each other deep down, than would they stoop so low as to have a wild strip poker party just to spite the other one? There is no real middle ground. It gets to the point where you feel bad even attempting to create an emotional attachment to either of them.The simple answer is no. Yes, they would get mad and do stupid things, but that's a little too extreme.The story is a bit off as a result of this huge shift in what the film wants to be. In some parts, the films flies by and can actually be quite enjoyable to view. But others are a complete step in the other direction. They move slower than anything, and just drag the film out as far as they can. It consistently shifts around until its eventual conclusion, and you would be hardest to not just fall asleep and make assumptions as to how the film ends. It could have easily done with a better editing job, and it would have made the film strive more towards being what it actually wanted to be.The other thing is the fact that the two leads really are lacking in the chemistry department. The movie is about a break-up because these two people just do not work together well. I can imagine them yelling and ranting at each other in real life because of how enormously different both are. Vaughn's frat-boy humour just does not play off Aniston as well as it would Will Ferrell or Owen Wilson. Likewise, Aniston's sweetness and girl next-door feeling does not work well off Vaughn either. And everything they say or do is the exact same as the thing they did before. Did they think that repeating the same thing over and over would help disguise the fact that these two cannot work well with each other? They are a mismatched pair plain and simple, and there is no way that I can physically imagine them as a couple after watching how they treat each other here (maybe the rumours of their own real-life break-up are more truthful than they let on?).They work on an even more off-and-on basis with their co-stars. Joey Lauren Adams proves to actually have a point in the film, but only on a few occasions does her dialogue actually mean anything to the progress of the rest of the film. And we all know Vaughn works well with Favreau, we have seen it time and time again. So why do some of their somber and long-winded exchanges seem forced and silly? Why do others actually work well within the film? It just feels like the crew slapped together a revised script and recruited as many commercially visible faces they could find, and cast them into all the roles with no real time to practice or make any further decisions.Overall, the movie has its moments. Some of them good, many of them bad. Is there any reason to watch this movie immediately? Not at all. Would it be an alright watch for a boring afternoon? Granted you can keep your eyes open, it would probably be just about the right time to watch it.4/10.",The Break-Up

Nothing too fancy there, just one more normal aspect of Life, the Universe and everything.The film in itself is thus pretty much believable, even though it uses just one too many clichés about men and women and the things they do when love turns to hatred. It isn't altogether bad, but I can't classify it as good, or even average either.Add to that the fact that I thought the ending to the film really didn't fit well with the rest of the events in the film and the score is there: 4 out of 10, only to be watched when thoroughly bored and having no single other option.",The Break-Up

You're suggesting to me these are just *show* lemons?"" - Gary (Vince Vaughn)",5,20 June 2006,"I would be lying to you if I said I had high hopes for 'The Break-Up'. You see, I love Vince Vaughn as a comedic actor. He's excellent, he gave an incredible performance in last year's Wedding Crashers which was without a doubt the funniest movie of last year. But, 'The Break-Up' also starred Jennifer Aniston. You see, I hated Friends. I thought it was one of the most overrated over-hyped pieces of sh*t ever to hit television (WATCH SEINFELD INSTEAD). Jennifer Aniston is a terrible actress, she has no freakin' range, and there has never ever been a role where I was pleased with her. She stunk in Friends, Bruce Almighty and don't even get me started on The Good Girl, the only reason people said she was so good in that was because of the awesome power of the acting around her (Zoey Deschannel, Tim Blake Nelson, Mike White, Jake Gyllenhaal and the astounding John C. Reilly). I thought the Break-Up would be a little funny, but mostly sappy and stupid. After I finally saw it, it was about what I expected only a tad funnier than sappy.Jennifer Aniston gives yet another dreadful performance, but thank god for Vince Vaughn having a bigger part. Vaughn is very funny in this and he handles his dramatic scenes very well, unlike Aniston whose crying scene is almost laugh-inducing. The Break-Up has an enormous supporting cast, most of which isn't very noticeable. Jon Favreau and Jason Bateman has very small roles as Vaughn's friends, so does Ann-Margaret, Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio and Chasing Amy's Joey Lauren Adams. Justin Long is funny in a very different role as a gay receptionist. The only two supporting cast members who really shine are Judy Davis as an obnoxious art dealer and Best in Show's John Michael Higgins in a short but a scene-stealing hilarious role as Aniston's ambiguously gay brother who runs a male singing group known as the 'Tone Rangers'. For me, Higgins was the best part of the film.The Break-Up starts out as very funny, and remains in the range of funny until the long drawn-out final 30 minutes which are dare I say almost unbearable. The Break-Up doesn't offer anything new and it is the same as pretty much every other break-up comedy, but doesn't generate the hearty laughs of dare I say French Stewart's 'Love Stinks'. Ultimately, The Break-Up's tragic flaw is taking itself too goddamn seriously. Cmon, it's a comedy, dry those fake tears Aniston and tell a couple of fart jokes. Maybe I'm being too scathing, but hey, what the hell do I care? It's not like Jennnifer Aniston knows where I live. Anyway, I do not recommend The Break-Up for theater viewing, wait for DVD, you'll thank me later. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, AZ, 6/05/06)",The Break-Up
71,shark-43,Ending is the BEST part,5,22 January 2007,"Actually the ending is the BEST part of the movie. Many people have complained and screamed about the ending but these are the people who want their cotton candy endings no matter what has been laid out in front of them....and that's fine. But look, filmmakers also have a right to say - no, many times people DO NOT get back together and that is what is refreshing about the ending but that still does not make it a good movie. There are smart things in the script and some insightful moments but Vaughn's character clearly was immature and was not right for Anniston's character - that was very clear and that was what made the ending real - maybe not satisfying but REAL - that her character recognized that in the long run he would not change and they would be miserable together. Thats why at the end when she mentioned she was going on a trip I went ""uh-oh"" because every bad Kate Hudson/Adam Sandler rom-com would have had the cliché scene where the guy rushes to the airport to stop her from going. Just like so many bad movies end with the guy going to stop the wedding (except for The Graduate - which does it brilliantly and then shows them long enough on the bus afterwords to hint that they already may be regretting it). Their fight over the lemons was mundane but that was the point - so many long drawn out arguments starts over something so tiny but they bring out much deeper issues. This film has a great supporting cast that is sadly, really given nothing to do - Justin Long (so damn funny in Dodgeball) gets to play a effete gallery clerk but has nothing to play and Judy Davis (who is so brilliant at playing these kind of hard-edged career women) actually comes off bland.

74,moviemanMA,Condo Wars,7,19 June 2006,"Cute sarcasm can only go so far. In The Break Up, the latest romantic comedy from Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, what seemed ""it was meant to be"" looks more like ""not a chance"".The feud begins with a dinner party gone awry when Gary (Vaughn) forgets the correct amount of lemons for Brooke's (Aniston) center piece. On top of that, Gary's unwillingness to get ready and his laziness to wash dishes pushes Brooke to the limit. What started out as a simple nothing fight erupts into a war for the ages. Their relationship dwindles into a power struggle to see who can hold out the longest for bragging rights and above all ownership of the condo. Sides are chosen amongst friends and the two touch gloves to engage in a merciless guilt fest.Gary's true friend Johnny O (Jon Favreau) aids him in his pursuit of rightful ownership of the apartment. Another friend, Riggleman (Jason Bateman), becomes the moderator of the two sides, trying to figure out what is best. On Brooke's side there is her flamboyant brother Richard (John Michael Higgins), a bouncy, vibrant acappella singer who insists that Gary lighten up. Her girl friend Addie (Joey Lauren Adams) drags her husband into this mess as well. A multitude of get back quick schemes go back and forth as each side seemingly succeeds but ultimately falls flat on their faces.Vaughns charismatic sarcasm is a much needed boost for the movie that overall is just an ordinary romantic comedy. Aniston brings her charm into the picture to accompany Vaughns witty style of humor. The film stresses the feud and what actually going on between Vaughn and Aniston. Although there is some definite tension, the looks exchanged while the other isn't looking are undoubtedly noticeable. Their past cannot escape them. They still have feelings for each other, feud or no feud.The ending is different than most films of this genre, but that can't make up for its unoriginal storyline. After it was over, I was left wanting more. There wasn't enough comedy between Vaughn and Aniston and too little commentary from Favreau whose remarks, though few, were clever and entertaining.The film is not one to be praised and acclaimed for.

The simple story gets complicated as each person tries to get back at the other until it gets so far out of hand with the hurting that by the end it's too late to turn back. Just lucky they weren't married with a kid, just a condo. This is a very well made film with a good cast and good acting.

76,gsygsy,magic moment,1,26 July 2006,"I appear to be unusual in that I had never seen Jennifer Aniston perform. I had never seen Friends. I had seen photographs of her with her ex-husband, but that was it. On the basis of this movie, she has an limited range, although she's capable enough within it, and she's easy on the eye. Vince Vaughan I have seen in a number of movies. He's OK in small parts. The script of this movie has at least three amusing moments - I remember laughing three times. The rest of the time I was soooooooooooo bored with the cliché-ridden drivel, the sit-com camera-work, the predictable set-pieces. The penultimate turn of the storyline was actually a surprise, but then they shot themselves in the foot with the very end. There are pleasant encounters with members of the supporting cast, a collector's item fleeting appearance by Ann-Margret, and a rare glimpse of a wonderfully over-the-top Judy Davis, memory of whose great performances merely confirm the comparative miniature of Ms Aniston's talent. Over two hours of my life was passed watching this. I was dragged to it by my partner on a tit-for-tat basis, as a punishment for having sat us through a number of CGI specials like X-Men Three, which for all their limitations stand as artistic monuments compared to The Break-Up. There is one indisputable magic moment in this film, however, which is when the credits roll. The sheer relief!",The Break-Up
77,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,"not much of a comedy, but worthwhile",7,2 January 2007,"The Vince Vaughan/Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy ""The Break-Up"" was incorrectly sold to audiences as such and therefore fails to fulfill on that level. Expectations aside, the film works to offer something most romantic comedies neglect to deliver: the romance. Well, sort of. After a quickie relationship montage at the start of the film, things turn sour for the two lovers, who spend the remainder of the film dealing with the repercussions of their break-up. For those looking for it, there's a decent amount of comedy in the first act, but as it dissolves into a toned down version of ""The War of the Roses"" a more serious tone begins to take hold of the film. With all of its moodiness, ""The Break-Up"" still works on a certain level thanks in big part to the impressive, passionate performances of the two leads. For a Hollywood feature, it presents an unexpectedly heartfelt, moving, and realistic portrayal of a modern relationship.",The Break-Up

It never decides if it wants to be comedy or drama or a blend of both, and ends up faltering because of it. There are very few laughs for a Vince Vaughn flick, and the bickering is neither humorous nor interesting. The acting is just okay, and the direction is pretty stale. The highlight, by far, is the interplay between Vaughn and Jon Favreau - the only truly funny parts of the film. The rest of the film, while attempting to be a realistic drama, never involves the audience, mostly because neither character is that endearing or likable. A rather depressing film.",The Break-Up

However, when what could have been a small argument explodes into attack after attack, they decide to break up. Then the real fighting begins. Both of them want the apartment, and neither is willing to back down. This movie has one of the most misleading trailers in history, making it look like your average Vince Vaughn comedy, when it reality it is 75% dramatic.I seriously can't stand it when a trailer makes a film look like something it's not at all. This film was made to look like a laugh out loud comedy that would have you grabbing your sides through the entire film, but when you actually watch it, it's funny at the beginning, and there's a few parts here and there, but mostly it's a depressing look at relationships and break ups. The fights they have are actually very realistic, and not funny at all, as the trailer would have you believe. I'm actually on the fence about this film, because it wasn't what I wanted to see, and yet it was still well made and had some really good performances.Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston do very well in their roles, and everybody else in the film does a good job as well. The funniest performance comes from Justin Long as Jennifer Aniston's flamboyant fellow employee.Overall, the movie is good if you're expecting a dramatic film with some comedy thrown in, so take this as a warning. If you're expecting non stop laughs, you will be let down.

The movie starts with us seeing how they met and then a whirlwind revisiting of their early times together. We are then brought into a pre-dinner argument that leads to their break-up. From here we follow them through their efforts to patch things up, and then to them selling their condo and going their separate ways.There is some gold from Vaughan, particularly on his bus trips (make sure you watch the bonus features) and when playing Playstation.

82,LivingDog,Exactly.,9,15 December 2006,"I chose to watch this movie so I could watch Jennifer Anniston walk, talk, smile, laugh, ... just be herself. She is such a wonderful charm of a person to grace the big screen I can't imagine a thing she could do that is wrong... and I was right. She is wonderful. But then I also realized that there really is a movie to be watched here. It is the story of one couple.First the cast - the entire cast is TOTALLY perfect. Not one person is forgettable. From Judy Davis (Marylin ""the succubus"" Dean - believe me - if you are in art of any kind - THESE are the blood sucking life sucking overlord people who run the art business) to Justin Long (Christopher - I remember him from ""Galaxy Quest"" - it was a bit part, but this kid has talent that fills the screen. I love the fact that he did this role instead of sticking to only one dimensional parts. Have you seen him in the Apple commercials? I'd buy one but ... I'm surprised Bill Gates hasn't retaliated with ""Buy a MAC ... you don't need a car!!"" ... ) and Jennifer Aniston and Vincent Vaughn in the leading roles - not one of them misses their mark! Not one - kudos to the entire cast for such perfect performances... ya' know - this just might be a film!? (yeah... I think so.)Vince Vaughn .... as Gary Grobowski the insensitive guy = perfectJennifer Aniston .... as Brooke Meyers the sensitive oh so warm lovable charming wonderful girlfriend = plu-plus-perfect!!!Joey Lauren Adams .... as Addie the friend who wants to help and does not hate all men and does not want to castrate every man on the planet = perfect (I first saw Joey on Married with Children... wow :)Jon Favreau .... as Johnny O the equally insensitive yet still best friend of Gary (Vaughn) who you gotta see the ""Club Med"" talk to get this movie as NOT being a ""chick flick."" ... think of it as ""college"" for *insensitive* guys. I mean guys, why be in a relationship if you don't care about the one you are supposed to be relating to?!? geeez - get a cat. I first saw Jon in ""The Replacements"" and then on his talk show with people in the movie business... I had new respect for actors and their craft b/c of him. He is so perfect - the ""Club Med"" scene - he is so ... on the mark. Great scene... Jon is perfect.Jason Bateman .... as Riggleman the nonjudgmental (THAT's IT! This movie is made as nonjudgmental as a movie can be made and still entertain. I mean like his scene with the two of them was really funny.) friend to both of them = perfectJudy Davis .... as Marilyn Dean is so utterly perfect in this role ... whoever did her makeup should be rewarded b/c it is like so ... ummmm ... real!? that she was scary to just look at and THOSE succubi *ARE* like that! I was amazed how accurately they caught ""art"" people. = perfectJustin Long .... as Christopher is totally totally awesome in this role = perfectCole Hauser .... as Lupus Grobowski the today kind of clubber (if that's what ""clubbing"" has become, I am glad I am going to die) = perfect (utterly convincing)Vincent D'Onofrio .... as Dennis Grobowski the oldest brother to Gary (Vaughn) who is so animated his character jumps off the big screen = perfect (I first saw him in ""Full Metal Jacket"" as Pvt. Pyle - holy mackerel.)This is NOT a chick flick. (As I said above - it is not judgmental in any way toward the guy or the girl - yes the guy is a jerk, but the director didn't make the movie to club all men to death - that's what a ""chick flick"" is! See?) It makes no pretense about being a fair representation, but rather makes the point that it is about _these two people_ = not all people, not all men, and not all women... So sit back, relax and enjoy this movie about one couple's story and how it evolves naturally - it's almost life-like. 9/10-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",The Break-Up
83,Okonh0wp,Can't remember the last time i enjoyed a romantic comedy this much,8,18 July 2009,"I am a guy who's fairly adverse to chick flicks. I also don't have enough long-term relationship experience to really relate to many films about romantic couples (I might be able to relate more to films about guys trying to get the girl, put it that way).The Break-Up is a romantic comedy with a gimmick that isn't particularly promising: Guy and girl get together, move in together into a goldmine of an apartment, break-up but neither wants to give up the apartment. It doesn't sound that great of a premise but a certain hidden love of Vince Vaughn's rapid-fire delivery of dialogue drew me to the film.At it's heart the Break-Up is a really great love story about two people who have already broken up. If a love story is about how love can blossom in the most unlikeliest of places, what is more unlikely territory than two people who have already declared themselves over? The film also made me realize that Jennifer Anniston is a really talented comic actress, after all. She's been written about so much in a negative way in the tabloids that I forgot that she has a sort of gift for delivering lines in a sassy and self-reflexive way. Both the leads create good comic characters that makes all of their scenes together something to watch. In the middle of all that juicy dialogue, there's a worthwhile story and by creating characters worth caring about, we care about the story.The film is also loaded with a great supporting cast playing the couple's family and social circle. They include John Michael Higgins, Jason Bateman, Joey Lauren Adams, and Jon Favreau and they add a lot of mileage to the movie because they give us an outsider's perspective on the craziness of romance.",The Break-Up

For example, if you want to get back with your partner, why would you blatantly try to show them that's not the case and drive them further away? Some of you guy's will say its just a movie, it's not supposed to make sense, but for me drama movies are supposed to and this movie is considerd as a drama.There were only a handful of funny moments which was disappointed as i expected more. One positive i felt in the movie was (Warning ending spoiler ahead) that it didn't end happily ever after like the vast majority of movies where the guy and girl end up together in the end which i find unique.Overall, this is just an average movie with an average plot which wasn't that intriguing that made me want the movie to end halfway through.

No. None of the above.Jennifer A. continues her Friends character while Vince V. continues losing his boyish charm. (he seemed puffy and in need of a gym) Film makers were clearly at odds as to what they were trying to say.It's not a chick flick, as most of them have male characters which appeal to women. This guy wouldn't appeal to anyone. His character is as annoying as he can get. A pool table in the dining room, come on.It's not a romantic comedy because those make you sweat during the main conflict while you wonder whether the two people you've just spent the last two hours with will get together in spite of themselves.It's not a drama as tears from a female do not a drama make.I can tell you what it isn't but for the life of me I can't tell you what it is. What is it? I'm shock they didn't use Chicago more than they did. The gimmick of both of them staying in the condo after the break-up was unrealistic and seemed fake or contrived.And I guess the biggest plot hole is how or why their relationship ever even began. I mean, shouldn't we have seen them fall in love or something before they bought property together. And if someone behaved that way to my sister Sara like he did to Jennifer in the first five minutes of the film, I'd be in her ear telling her to move away from the 'whack-job'.I am not a great fan of either performer however both of them are good actors/comedians.

This was a major studio movie, not an independent film. Universal had invested a bunch of money in this. I was braced for a plot twist....that didn't happen! When the closing titles ran I breathed a sigh of relief. The people who wrote and directed this movie have actually been outside of Beverly Hills. They know how real life works.This isn't the movie the posters and previews tried to sell us. Instead, it's about a dozen times better.I'm not going to rehash the plot because that's been summarized on a hundred other postings. What I want to mention is that I believed these characters. They were as real as my family and the people I work with. Neither of the main characters is at ""fault"" in the problems in their relationship. Both characters have good and bad points.Rather than being a vehicle to spotlight the charms of the two leads, this movie surrounds them with enough wonderful actors and interesting subplots to make another dozen equally entertaining movies.Both main characters have families, friends, and co-workers. And what a wonderful supporting cast. To mention just a few, Ann-Margaret has a rather brief part as Jennifer's mother. Other than hair color, she hasn't done anything to hide the fact that she's not Kim from BYE, BYE BIRDIE any more. She's a great looking mature woman. Since she's the main reason I saw the movie in the first place, it would have been nice if her part had been expanded but you can't please everybody.Jennifer's father is played by Vince's own dad. Now that's interesting.Vincent D'Onofrio plays Vince's dad. As always, he's great. When I saw THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD I expected that he would be the next big star. He hasn't made the cover of People, but going over his filmography I see that he's done a lot of solid work.I've liked Joey Lauren Adams since the first movie I saw her in CHASING AMY. She plays Jennifer's best friend, and her husband is played by Peter Billingsley, Ralphie from A Christmas STORY.All in all, just a really great movie.The spoiler, and it's not a big one. Lots of people have expressed dislike for the coda at the end of the film. I'm going to keep things ambiguous here since I don't want to give away any major plot points, but if you've seen ANNIE HALL and THE WAY WE WERE you've seen this scene before. It's exactly the way I would have ended the movie if I'd written and directed it.Did I mention that this is a great movie? Just in case, I'll do so again.",The Break-Up
90,anhedonia,Another disappointment in Aniston's oeuvre,1,11 June 2006,"There's a moment in ""The Break-Up"" when art gallery owner Marilyn Dean (Judy Davis) turns to Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) and says, ""This isn't surrealism. This isn't cubism. This is paint-by-numbers."" Marilyn's referring to Brooke's relationship crisis with Gary (Vince Vaughn), but she very well could have been talking about the film. Of course, I doubt the writers, Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavendar, have that much of a sense of irony.I realize there are loads of disappointed moviegoers who went in expecting a romantic comedy - and the film's trailers are to blame for that, I suppose - and, instead, found a bleakly dark film about the break-up of a relationship. Frankly, that's the only refreshing thing about this film.This isn't a pat romantic comedy. However, it has all the trappings and clichés of one, down to the obligatory best friend for each main character. In Brooke's case, it is Addie, played by Joey Lauren Adams, who still has the cutest husky voice on film. And for Gary, there's Johnny O, played by Jon Favreau (what a shock!).I have no problem sitting through a film that recounts a couple's break-up and the lengths to which they go to make the other miserable and/or jealous. However, in ""The Break-Up,"" neither Gary nor Brooke is all that interesting a person. And - talk about suspension of disbelief - it's incredibly tough to swallow that these two would ever have found each other even vaguely interesting.Both Brooke and Gary are pedestrian people. Their arguments are, to quote Marilyn, paint-by-numbers. He's immature and accuses her of always nagging him; she complains he never listens to her and takes her for granted.So we get to see these two bicker and yell about nothing; their methods to make each other jealous are neither inventive nor humorous. Watching this movie, I remembered how much I enjoyed ""The War of the Roses"" (1989), a superb, dark comedy about a disintegrating relationship. But that film was smart, had passion and Oliver and Barbara Rose's revenge was gleefully funny. There was something perversely delightful about that film. And we understood why Oliver and Barbara Rose liked each other so much, thanks to terrific chemistry between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. I have no idea whether Aniston and Vaughn have any on-screen chemistry. Because in ""The Break-Up,"" we never ever get a sense of why Brooke and Gary are together or what brought them together. The film would've been well served had Garelick and Lavendar thought to give us a glimpse of these two people in love, so that we could then understand and sympathize when we saw their relationship crumbling. Instead, the writers resort to lazy storytelling. The film is peopled with dull and/or typical characters. The only pleasant surprise is Jason Bateman, turning an underwritten role of a rather slimy real estate agent into something that, at least, makes one smile. The always-terrific Vincent D'Onofrio's sparse scenes only make us yearn for more of him in this movie.The others are true toss-aways. What Ann-Margret is doing in this movie as Brooke's mom is beyond me. They couldn't have plucked any middle-aged woman off the street for this thankless role? Ann-Margret's only purpose seems to be to provide some sort of musical background for a dinner-table scene that just strains to be funny. Apparently, we continue paying the price for ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" (1997).There's nothing wrong about watching a movie about the break-up of a relationship. Francois Ozon handled the subject matter beautifully in ""5X2"" (2004), and just before I saw ""The Break-Up,"" I watched another the French film, ""Clara et Moi"" (2004). Now, there was a film dealing with real issues, gave us characters we cared about and with whom we sympathized because we knew what brought them together and why they loved each other. Compared to those two films, ""The Break-Up"" seems downright mediocre and superficial, which is exactly what it is.",The Break-Up
91,Jay_Exiomo,Romantic comedy without the romance and much of the laughs,4,26 July 2006,"""The Break-Up"" - an anti-romantic comedy as heralded by its drum-beaters that more or less benefited from the hype generated by its lead stars - begins awkwardly, unfolds without liveliness, then gets funny, only to lose steam again towards the end. It's unfortunate, since for a moment during the proceedings I thought I would start enjoying the movie as a whole. Eventually, it's unsatisfying.Gary (Vince Vaughn) is a Chicago tour guide and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) is a dealer at a high-end art gallery. They meet during a baseball game but after a montage during the opening credits that summarizes what was once a happy relationship, the couple starts arguing about lemons, and what do you know, the relationship turns sour. What follows is a battle of wits to drive the other party out of the condo and the inevitable realization that all may not be over. Yet.When I first heard about the film's premise I thought what a great idea it was if it could be played correctly. But by downplaying the element of romance, and by not being as funny it could have perhaps been, ""The Break-Up feels dumbed down to reach a common factor. In doing so director Peyton Reed, and writers Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender churn out a final product that's stripped off of wit and intelligence. Gary and Brooke are not what you'd really call smart people; they are a simplistically shallow couple. The movie has a novel idea but it fails to realize it.Aniston's once promising career in movies is starting to cast doubts with this film, and even though you can see the sparkle from the former sitcom star, she doesn't appear to have the same charisma on the big screen. Vaughn does his best with that boorish charm, but overdoes it in some parts. I can't say much for his shallow performance, except that he does emit occasional flashes of the comedic chops from last year's ""Wedding Crashers"". Jon Favreau and Vincent D'Onofrio deliver during the times they appear on screen.""The Break-Up"" is an intriguing antithesis to Hollywood's dumbing down of the genre. But as per usual, there should be an intuitive grasp of the theme's inner nature and at the very least, a consistently humorous script.

94,rparham,Break-up not quite a comedy,6,14 July 2006,"The Break-Up is a film that seems to be mis-advertised. It would appear, from the trailers and commercials, and the presence of two, principally, comedic actors, to be a comedy. However, as it finally unfolds on the big screen, The Break-Up is more of a drama than it is a comedy and while this isn't a completely terrible thing, those looking for a funny two hours are going to be sorely disappointed.The Break-Up focuses on, shockingly, a break up of Gary (Vince Vaughan) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston), a couple who met at a Chicago Cubs game, which we see in the pre-title sequence, and now are reaching a breaking point in their relationship. They are two very different people coming to grips with their differences in a not very adult way: after an initial fight, Brooke throws Gary off the bowling team, invites her acapella loving brother to practice in the apartment, and begins arranging for men to pick her up at their condo. He, in turn, hosts strip poker nights, buys a pool table which he knows she doesn't want in the place, and plays video games to all hours of the night.There is just one problem with this scenario: she still wants him, and he didn't want to break-up, so while they are hatching various plots to undue the other, they are failing to really deal with their problems to lead to a satisfactory resolution that doesn't involve them selling the condo and going their separate ways.The Break-Up is interesting in some ways. So many romantic comedies are afraid to deal with the unfortunate reality that some times things in life don't work out between two people, and that would be the case here. Some of the disagreements between Gary and Brooke seem realistic enough (She complains that he doesn't want to want to help her with the dishes, to which he replies ""Why would I want to do dishes?""), and the characters grapple with their inability to actually ask the other for what they want, which is a common problem in real life.That being said, does it actually add up to good entertainment? There are moments when the two have fights in front of family and friends and you feel about as uncomfortable as the characters who are cowering in the corner or quickly exiting so as to get in the middle of the fight. The Break-Up's biggest misstep is occasionally wanting to be a comedy, but rarely being very funny. Gary's tactless brother, Lupus (Cole Hauser), is amusing as he proves to be as offensive to anyone around as he can be, and other brother Dennis (Vincent D'Onofrio), stuck in suits a size too small, is amusing in his awkwardness, and in a few scenes here and there, we get the same amusing Vince Vaughan that was featured in Old School and Dodgeball, but it's few and far between. What could have been a biting satire proves to be drama that is occasionally punctuated with moments of humor, not a comedy with a sometimes serious bent.The Break-Up isn't a bad film, it is well shot, the performers are all capable and the film generally holds together. It isn't boring or inept. It is simply not the package that was advertised and what is offered up in it's place is not quite as good as you would like.",The Break-Up

Before I start ripping apart this movie I will admit that I do like Vince Vaughn a lot and while I never thought the trailers for ""The Break up"" were amusing, I did find myself quite curious to see how the film was going to end and how Aniston and Vaughn looked together on the big screen.Seeing that Aniston and Vaughn are a real life celebrity couple you would think that they would have some kind of chemistry on the big screen. This is where the first problem lies because to me neither Aniston nor Vaughn had any on screen chemistry. The acting between the two seemed very forced and unbelievable. Which brings up another issue, none of the characters in this movie are likable. They are all self-centered and very stereotypical. Vaughn's character Gary plays video games and watches sports all day which granted most guys do but why make his character so stereotypical? And when Brooke breaks up with Gary he can barely move away from the television and doesn't seem to care. Which leads to the next problem which is the whole break up thing which was really ridiculous. They broke up because Gary didn't want to help do the dishes??? I mean how unrealistic is that. Maybe if the script developed the relationship more in the beginning, the break up would have seemed more realistic and understandable but it failed to do that.The next big problem is the subject matter, the fact that ""The Break Up"" tries to be a slapstick comedy is a big problem. This movie fails at almost every attempt to be funny. I think I may have chuckled once maybe twice but that's it. The reason why the film isn't funny is because breaking up isn't a funny experience at all and while the writers Jeremy Garelick, Jay Lavender, and yes Vince Vaughn himself thought they were creating a creative movie with funny situations almost all the humor in the film failed because honestly who thinks breaking up is funny? With that being said, the film also tends to be very unbalanced for the first hour and twenty minutes the movie tries to be funny and then about twenty minutes before the movie ends it tries to be serious. I think if the film tried to be serious instead of actually trying to be funny by throwing in stale gay jokes and stupid sex gags it would have been better. The last twenty minutes of the film were decent because it's the only time in the movie where it shows the emotions of the characters and makes them seem human but by that time the audience doesn't want to be depressed they want to see something funny which is another reason it fails. It wants to be a dramedy but the drama comes in to play to late in the film and the comedy doesn't work.""The Break Up"" features a pretty decent cast all of which are poorly used in this film. Vaughn who I normally like just isn't believable nor do I care about him because he is self centered and uncaring. Aniston who I never really liked as an actress actually again isn't likable. She seems like such an uncaring character herself in this film. Jon Favreau who I normally like is a very stereotypical and unlikable character. Then you have the so called gay characters played by Justin Long and John Michael Higgins both again who play very annoying and stereotypical gay characters. Lastly Jason Bateman who I really liked is again a very uncaring and selfish character. Even being a big fan of Bateman I still did not like the role he played here. I felt the cast had potential however because of the poor script and directing no one involved came out of the film as being likable.In the end, ""The Break Up"" is a huge waste of time and talent. I felt bad for not liking the film because it did try to do something different that no Hollywood movie has tried before but it failed horribly at it. Some things in life aren't funny and I think breaking up is one of them. The fact that Vaughn and Aniston are dating in real life probably made the film even more unrealistic. There are so many problems with the film from the unlikable characters to the poorly developed script. The movie tries to be funny yet fails and then at the end figures that maybe if we throw in some drama it will save the film from totally sucking but like I said by then everyone is already set to laugh. It's just a bad movie and for those who want to see it just for Aniston and Vaughn to see if they have good on screen chemistry, I say wait for video because honestly they have none and you will just be mad at yourself for wasting anywhere from $6 to $10 on a ticket for ""The Break Up""",The Break-Up
96,TheMovieMark,Not your conventional romantic comedy - and that's a good thing,7,2 June 2006,"As mama used to say, ""The extent of the nourishment you get from your  entertainment water is directly related to how deep your well of  expectations runs."" I always thought mama was a bit too verbose in her  metaphorical philosophizing, but there's truth in them there words!  Thanks to Hollywood's constant desire to market films based on what  they feel they have to trick people into thinking they're about, some  audiences will likely go to see The Break-Up, ignore the insinuations  of the movie's title, and expect something cute and fluffy. As such,  the movie is unfairly saddled with expectations that it can't possibly  meet for no other reason than the simple fact that this is NOT a  conventional ""chick flick"" romantic comedy that will warm those little  heart cockles and send you floating out of the theater on a cotton  candy cloud.  After a chance meeting at a Cubs/White Sox baseball game, an ""opening  credit relationship photo montage"" creatively establishes that Jennifer  Aniston and Vince Vaughn are a couple. Just not for much longer. You  see, Jennifer is busy cooking for a family dinner. Vince's only  responsibility is to bring home 12 lemons so that she can create a  centerpiece for the dinner table. So what does he do? Brings home  three. Jen's understandably agitated.  Rather than dutifully go get the extra lemons, Vince tries to find  alternatives that will allow him to just sit on the couch and play  video games until everybody arrives. Perhaps use the lemons to flavor  the chicken since he tasted it and thought it was a little too spicy  anyway? Maybe place them in a glass and create a smaller centerpiece?  Yeah, it's fairly clear which three letters he puts in ""class.""   This leads to his lack of desire to help with the dishes later that  evening. Oh, he'll help with them in the morning, but Jen really wants  them done tonight. Fifteen minutes of work won't kill the guy, right?  When Jen expresses her disdain for the lack of appreciation he shows  her, he goes into a character-exposing rant and declares his desire to  just be left alone. Jen's had enough and decides to grant him his wish.  Commence with the break-up and the emotional tug-of-war that carries  the majority of the movie.  This is where some audiences might get lost. Why? Probably because it  feels so real, and sometimes reality doesn't always sell. People still  love fairy tales, you know? The arguments and hard-feelings that slowly  develop will likely hit home with anybody who has gone through a break  up, and I have no doubt that many, if not most, guys will fill a little  discomfort when they see some of themselves in Vince.  The thing I appreciated the most is despite his penchant for being a  jerk, Vince isn't adorned with a black hat and presented to us for our  jeering. It's just the way he is. He likes doing things his way. He  treats his friends and brothers in the same manner, but they still love  the guy and like hanging out with him; he just needs to learn to accept  doing things he might not want to for the people he loves. He's likable  and funny enough that we root for him to learn the lesson.  Likewise, Jennifer isn't placed on a pedestal with a golden halo on her  head. Though she's the more sympathetic of the two, she still resorts  to playing dirty and isn't allowed to come off completely innocent.  Perhaps the character flaws won't play well with the ""give me  idealistic characters!"" crowd, but I found them refreshingly realistic.  The movie's focal point is the often volatile chemistry between Vince  and Jennifer, which I thought was great, but the supporting characters  are also very effective, albeit underused. Vince has some show-stealing  scenes with Jason Bateman and particularly one with Jon Favreau (and  his ever-increasing girth) that are so good that you can't help but be  disappointed that there aren't more to savor.  Speaking of disappointment, go ahead and prepare yourself for the  potential of more as the closing credits begin to scroll. I admit that  I wanted a little more closure than I was given, and that seemed to be  the audience consensus. I suppose we should admire the screenwriters  for sticking by their guns and refusing to tie all the loose ends as  tightly as test audiences have demanded, but that doesn't mean we have  to be happy about it. I could have handled it better had it not felt so  abrupt and left me feeling a little incomplete.  But it certainly doesn't ruin the movie. You just need to check your  expectations and give the film a fair chance. Don't be a pawn of the  marketing team's efforts to mislead audiences into the door.  If you're a Vince fan I would also advise you not to expect the Johnny  Jump-Up zaniness of The Wedding Crashers or Dodgeball. The Break-Up is  a movie of a different breed. Abandoning the temptation to deliver a  consistently uproarious comedy romp, The Break-Up deliberately balances  itself with dramatic conflict, and gives us something a little  different than what Hollywood has forced us to become accustomed to.  It doesn't do it flawlessly, but at least it makes the attempt.",The Break-Up
97,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Break-Up (2006),1,31 May 2008,"Why Anniston why? I loved you in friends and Bruce Almighty but this movie was one of the worst movies that i have ever seen.This was like sitting through 1 and half hours of your parents arguing.I think i only grinned once.It gets worse at the ending. Very depressing and stale ending that had me saying ""oh my god are you serious"". The only good thing to come out the ending was that it had finished.I am not a big fan of Vince Vaughn but he was great in Wedding Crashers. In this he was annoying and i just wanted him to shut up.I don't recommend this ever. If you want a good romantic comedy go see Just Friends.1/10",The Break-Up
98,ivko,Timing,7,2 July 2006,"People often wonder why it's so hard to maintain relationships these days. Do we lack something that our parents had, and what their parents had even more before them? Is there something fundamental that we lack, some gene or strength of character that renders us incapable of solid relationships? I think the answer often boils down to simple timing. Simply put, we have more choices now for living our lives than any generation before us did. Consequently we find ourselves maturing at different rates, and this leads to failures in our personal lives. ""The Break-Up"" is a story of two people who's timing is tragically off. Brooke (Aniston) and Gary (Vaughn) are a couple in Chicago who have reached the breaking point. Brooke declares the relationship to be over, but secretly hopes the fear of losing her will prompt Gary to grow up and appreciate her more. Gary, however, isn't initially capable of understanding what Brooke wants. And so they begin a slow, painful decent into unhappiness. Each of them in turn looks for new ways to hurt the other, and succeeds enough to make them both miserable. The movie is an effective dramedy, so you alternate between laughing and cringing, always feeling a little off balance, a feeling mirrored by the characters. During the course of the film both come to several realizations about themselves and their partner that allow them to understand themselves and each other better, but again timing is the issue they face right up until the bittersweet end. The movie does end on a bit of an ambiguous note, letting the audience decide what the ultimate fate of Brooke and Gary will be, a feature I appreciated because normally these things are spoon fed to the viewer like we were children. If you who have lived thru the end of a long term relationship or marriage you will probably recognize many of the conversations and situations they have here, including that most painful of situations. The point at which there is no more yelling, no more tears or pleading or even anger. The moment when there is nothing more to say and you feel rather than just know that it's over. The dark comedy of the film has shades of ""War of the Roses"", while the drama reminded me of ""Closer"". With smart dialog and a palpable chemistry between Vaughn and Aniston, this is a very watchable film. Also fun to watch was the role reversal of Vaughn and Favreau, off screen friends who have costarred in several films together. Vaughn typically takes on the obnoxious persona while Favreau plays the straight guy, but here their roles are reversed and you can tell they each enjoy playing up the other side.",The Break-Up
99,moutonbear25,Breaking up is hard to watch,7,11 June 2006,"Although I try to limit my reading of celebrity gossip rags to while I'm waiting in line at the grocery store, I will admit to being taken in by the plight of frequent cover girl, Jennifer Aniston. She's the girl next door and the poor thing was left behind by one of the prettiest boys on the planet for one of the prettiest girls on the planet. She locked herself away in her Malibu beach house and spoke to no one but family and former cast mates from FRIENDS, the TV show that made her into an international star but whose success is making it very difficult for her to establish herself as bankable movie star. When THE BREAK-UP began filming in Chicago, the irony of the casting caught on and before long the rumors spread that Aniston and co-star, Vince Vaughan, were getting close. As they have no interest in confirming details of their relationship to the public, the intrigue is still high more than a year later. In that time, countless articles have dropped about the broken girl and the man determined to bring happiness into her life again and each of those articles has made mention of this movie. THE BREAK-UP is the world's keyhole to peer through for a glimpse of what Jen and Vince are really like.Of course that's ridiculous as they are actors playing parts in the movie but neither of these actors stretches themselves much further than their established personas so its pretty darn close. And director, Peyton Reed (BRING IT ON, DOWN WITH LOVE), gives the audience exactly what its been craving without delay during an opening credit montage of photographs of the happy couple doing nothing but being madly in love. It's a succession of every photograph the paparazzi wishes it could get hold of. Jen and Vince, who should count themselves very fortunate their names don't blend well into one defining moniker, play Brooke Meyers and Gary Grubowski, two people who look simply natural and happy photographed playing games with friends or dressed as cows for some costume contest. Not only does this satisfy the bizarre celebrity fascination that inexplicably drew us to the theater in the first place, it also serves a great function for the film as well. We are now set up to realize what these two are throwing away when they break up in the next scene. The break-up itself exemplifies what works and what does not about this film. It comes fast and early in the film and it is not pleasant to watch. There are many an angry word said and the condo the couple share stinks of regret, uncertainty and fear once all the doors have been shut. The level of pain reached in this scene is unexpected and atypical for a romantic comedy but commendable for it's striving to be realistic. Break-ups are not funny; they hurt and this scene does not pretend otherwise. But are break-ups still happening because of the tired issues these two have? He wants to just come home and have a beer and a minute to himself while she wants him to want to do the dishes. Obviously, there is more to it than that but neither one of them seems to have a clue how to say it and instead of realizing that they're both not expressing themselves properly, they yell louder so the other can really get it. Not surprisingly, that doesn't work.And so the now defunct couple fights for ground and supremacy for the rest of the film. The war that ensues grows out of hand with mixed results. Fighting with witty banter can energize a viewer to take sides and get into it but fighting that pretty much entails nothing more than screaming hurtful things is just awkward and can make the viewer want to leave the room to give them some privacy. And while the laughs do come, they are not always enough to forget that these two never really wanted to break up in the first place. Their antics make it more and more impossible to go back and repair their busted relationship that the hope they will finally learn how to say what they truly need to each other, like the not- so-complicated ""I just want us to see each other, be there for each other and not take the other for granted"", falls further away. Before you know it, this romantic comedy has become a romantic tragedy.",The Break-Up

Simple. When we get to the scene where a D-Bag named J. M.

101,bob-rutzel,"Flat, not funny",2,28 October 2006,"Brooke (Anniston) is quite tired of making the relationship with Gary (Vaughn) work as Gary sees no need to change his ways. So they break up.I can see why Anniston and Vaughn are no longer together in real life. After this flat-liner no one would want to be associated with it. These are two good actors(Vaughn is good when he doesn't try to be comedic), but nothing they do saves this movie. There is no chemistry between them and it shows on the big screen. You don't care if they break up, and get back together. You just want this to be over. You are waiting for something funny to appear to make things a little less tight. Never happened. I blame the script, maybe Vaughn but never Anniston, who is turning out to be a really good actress. Yes, she was the best thing in here. But this is supposed to be a comedy and I want to say it's light drama, but cannot. It is almost heavy drama. Something no one expected. This could have been something akin to the War of The Roses, but falls far short of that classic.Why blame the script? Because I have seen Rachael (Anniston) get mad at Ross (from the Friends TV show) and break up with him and the results were funny, funny, funny, and that didn't happen here. Another reason to blame the script is that Vaughn helped write it. Maybe he should have asked Jennifer to help out with that. Ya think? I just don't picture Vaughn as someone comedic (no, I didn't find him funny in The Wedding Crashers either) and believe he is best suited for crime drama where he will excel, but that's just me.The rest of the cast were fine. Ann-Margaret had a small part in here too. But, there was that irritating family dinner where some family members sang acappella and that was extremely irritating and annoying. That was a harbinger of things to come. Again, look to the script.",The Break-Up

This film never intends to be uplifting or happy, and although it could be categorized into the romantic comedy genre, it's really not what it's about. Instead, you get a bittersweet account of how potentially promising relationships get screwed up every day, and how sometimes in life it's the people we really care about that we end up hurting the most.

The film is so sexist and abusive that I felt sorry for both actress and actor being part of such a tragedy. Not to mention they had zero chemistry, acting like a cartoon version of themselves. It was very painful watch honestly, a couple shouting at each other for the guy being a dickhead.
The recent film Marriage Story did what this one tried to do back then, only it was executed masterfully, realistically, with a guy who was not a total douchbag!

109,Robert_Hearth,"""Pick A Side"" --- Tagline For ""The Break-Up""",4,17 December 2006,"""The Break-Up"" (2006) Directed By: Peyton Reed Starring: Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Judy Davis, & Justin Long MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for sexual content, some nudity and language) ""The Break-Up"" is probably most famous for sparking the famous relationship of Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn. Think about it as the ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" for the couple. The only difference is that ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" was a fun, entertaining movie and ""The Break-Up"" is anything but. In fact, this is one of the least entertaining and joyless movies I have seen this year. We all know how hard and awkward break-ups can be. ""The Break-Up"" analyzes this with very little compromise. In fact, it puts this failing couple into one of most awkward situations imaginable--having them share a condo until they can sell it. The real question, though, is not how they will handle this situationbut, why should we really want to see it? Why do we want to see two people bicker and complain for an hour and forty or so minutes? Why do we want to experience all of the awkward moments that come with this scenario? The answer is that, of course, we don't want to do anything of these things. Herein lays the problem with ""The Break-Up"". It is a movie that we just don't want to see filled with characters we don't really care about.Gary Grobowski (Vaughn) and Brooke Meyers (Aniston) were once a loving couple who had everything they thought they needed: each other, a wonderful condo, and jobs that were certain to propel them to bigger and better things. But, now, the relationship is over and neither of them can afford to pay for the mortgage without each otherand so they are having to sell, but, until they find a buyer, they must live together. Both, still bitter over the difficult break-up, decide to make each other miserable by flirting with other people, inviting loud friends over, quartering the condo up into different compartments, and more. But, will they realize that they really do love each other and reconcileor is this break-up for good? If you have ever watched a romantic comedy, you know that the entire movie circles around you wanting desperately for the couple to be happy and together at the end. I didn't feel that way at all about the couple in ""The Break-Up"". In fact, I only wanted them to go their separate ways and to stop the annoying arguing and the backstabbing. Vince Vaughn's character, Gary, in particular, was horribly annoying whenever Aniston's character, Brooke, was around, and, while Brooke was at least likable, many of her actions seemed mean and reprehensible. How could anyone want these two to get together? The relationship was just bothersome and aggravating.How could ""The Break-Up"" not work? It had a great cast and the director of ""Down with Love"" (a bitter, yet hilarious romantic comedy) and ""Bring It On"" (a hip, edgy teen comedy) behind it? This movie seemed like a sure bet and yet it just doesn't work. It isn't romantic. It isn't funny. It is awkward and the constant arguing gets old very quickly. The characters, themselves, are indeed very strange--almost like parodies of real people, but the movie takes itself far too seriously to allow them to seem realistic. The two main characters are not made out to be people we can really care about. Gary, especially, is despicable for the majority of the movie and Brooke, though the only main character with which we can sympathize, does her fair share of mean things. On top of all of this, where was the humor? Was this supposed to be a comedy? If so, then it is one of the least effective comedies of the year. On a warmer note, Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn give great performances and the actual break-up (and ensuing arguments) are handled realistically. The only problem is: why would anyone really want to see them? Final Thought: Despite good performances from the leads, ""The Break-Up"" is an awkward, unfunny movie that fails to engage its audience.Overall Rating: 4/10 (C+)",The Break-Up

Brooke is trying her best to get Gary to notice her by picking up after him, cooking for him, but he just doesn't get it! He's cold-hearted and rather play video games and get together with his friends instead of realizing he should reciprocate, so what does Brooke do? Meet other men. Soon Brooke and Gary break-up and it gets worse. There are some great dialog and great scenes and you sympathize with the character Brooke.

And that's a pretty good emotional place to be in if you're hoping to experience the thrill and agony of modern romance.The two leads are played effortlessly, if not spectacularly, with a consistent level of energy and style. Vince Vaughn is very believable as the self starter with grand ambitions, Gary Grobowski. Vince wears his fragility very lightly, never overplaying his take on the delicate male ego. It's this particular quality that endears him to her and to us. And it's Gary's thinly veiled insecurities that exacerbate his mishandling of his troubled relationship. Jennifer does some good stuff as a successful, slightly uptight art dealer, who at first is caught off guard by Gary's aggressive familiarity. As inevitable as their coupling is, I didn't resent this contrivance, as I was eager to see these two characters interact. That's a rare thing for me, to tolerate facile, corny set ups, but Vaughn's considerable charm pulled me along.The most absurd moments involve the friends and coworkers. For Gary it's Jon Favreau as the equally clueless bartender buddy. Some typical cliché moments of macho posturing are played very self consciously for laughs, and often successfully, but it's Vince's ability to pump some life into these possibly limp interactions that is interesting and even impressive. Jen has her best girl-girl moments with her imposing boss, with Judy Davis doing a fine impersonation of a dominant New York City art gallery owner, an absurdly imperious witch with an unexpected maternal instinct. (I picked up on the character reference to the famed real life Mary Boone, but I bet most people don't.) When things finally go south between our couple, I kept waiting for the seemingly required-by-RomCom-law moment when they declare that their love will triumph over all - they shall be united - but luckily nothing quite like that is foisted on us. Their attraction, apparently, is only floating and bobbing along atop the increasingly turbulent waves of their mutually misunderstood relationship. Of course they want each other, that's not the point, that's besides the point. It's how badly or carelessly they choose to express it that's the critical flaw. And it's made all the more intense when they both recognize this, and very briefly, attempt to wrestle their way through their impasse. Some people, including me, couldn't help but remember Rachael's and Ross's similar tragedy, their ""world shattering"" thwarted love. Yeah, it's familiar, but Vince's Gary has much bigger balls.Those rare moments—when people realize that exactly how we happen to say things does, in fact, effect the way we think and feel—are what comedy depends on. And, it's our failures to recognize this aspect of our tortuous relationships that is the stuff of tragedy. This nobly intentioned film acknowledges all of this intelligently, respectfully, gracefully. I admire it's well observed foibles and salute it's modest sincerity. And, of course, there's Jen's lovely ass!",The Break-Up
116,jax713,Honest & thought-provoking,8,14 November 2006,"Though there are no doubt many people who could not relate to this movie, there are just as many who can. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has had a relationship blow up in their face without warning.Relationships are all about expectations and this film sets about showing how resentment builds when one partner is not meeting the other's expectations even on a most basic level. This story is about when the lust is fading in exchange for the reality of everyday life. It's about when two lovers arrive at a plateau where one of them feels unappreciated and the other feels it's just too much work to do the little things that would bring even small joy to his partner. It's also about how one argument can escalate beyond reason because it stirs up all the buried resentments and shows how, somehow, there is always one partner who is in the dark about the other's needs. In this movie, like in The War of the Roses, it shows with crystal clarity that it's the man who has no clue about how to work at the relationship.I give this film a lot of credit for its honesty in depicting how lovers can turn into enemies to prove their point. And I was amazed at the scene between Favreau & Vaughn when Favreau tells Vaughn - his buddy - that he's selfish and self-centered. Yeah, everyone likes to hang out with him because he's funny and entertaining, but everyone knows he's all about himself. And I could feel a cheer coming on whenever Aniston reminded him of all the ""routine"" things she does for Vaughn with never a thank you or the simple courtesy of at least listening to her.The Break-Up is almost an instructional film about the little things to look out for when you're part of a couple so that you don't make the same mistakes and it's done with style, some humor and a lot of reality. At the end you see how one character has grown as a result of the break-up, so you leave with hope. Highly recommended for the great performances by Aniston and Vaughn, for the incisive and insightful subject matter, and for the balance of comedy and drama. By the time you hit 30, everyone knows you can start an evening with your lover making jokes and end it in silence and sleeping in separate beds.",The Break-Up

The guy talks like the guy from ""King of Queens"" to his wife. He also talks like Jack Black in the 'lazy throw away lines way' - this type of ""attractive girl marries slob of a man and ends up annoyed"" formula is done to death. It also isn't funny anymore.Typical Jennifer Aniston vehicle where she overacts and whines at a man while being high maintenance and complains to her friends about him(makes you wonder if that's how she really is- if so congrats on getting out Mr Pitt).Can you believe this film is being used by psychiatrists to explain how men and women think differently. In reality it isn't even about how men and women think differently. It's about a dramatized relationship with extreme people who really wouldn't be together anyway and everyone else on the planet would want to divorce if it meant they could get away from them.

Girl falls in love with the idiot. Girl gets tired of boy being an idiot. Boy makes girl even more mad by not changing. Boy finally decides to change and girl doesn't want him anymore.That's pretty much real life. I love the energy of this movie. The scenes in which there are conflict between the Vaughn and Anniston characters are great moments of cinema.Their arguments they have seem more real life than Hollywood. The most appealing thing about this movie you either know someone in their situation or you are in their situation.What really pulls this story line together because you get to see how different they are and everything tells you that they shouldn't work, but somehow they manage to make it work. You get real depth into both characters and not just gag lines to keep the story going.This is a good movie, not the best comedy drama, but it is worth watching. I would highly recommend this movie, now a lot of people on here did not give this movie a good review or a good rating.

119,sourapple,"predictable, some parts funny though",1,5 June 2006,"It's predictable, and I'm the type of person who actually likes formulaic movies. But ehh.. ""The Break Up"" was not for me. Although Vince Vaughn is a funny man (absolutely), he got stuck with the blandest leading lady Hollywood can think of: Jennifer Aniston.There simply is no Jennifer Aniston movie that I liked. In ""Derailed"", what started as a great suspense movie (with Clive Owen, of course), ended as a disappointment. But then I said, don't' give up on Aniston. She must have talent hiding around. However, after her recent list of movies, I've lost hope.Vince Vaugn delivers his line in his usual candor, and that's practically the highlight of the film. Oh, and Ann Margret, and of course the lovely Jon Favreau! They actually bought light to this yawn-worthy movie. It's a good thing character actors were able to deliver. I love it! Maybe a little tweak on the script and overall execution would've made this a more tolerable movie to watch.Between last year's Hitch and The Break Up, give me Will Smith and Eve Mendes any day. They had CHEMISTRY. Vaughn and Aniston did not. They looked like kissing siblings/cousins in this movie. In my honest opinion.Digression: Oh, Aniston! You're simply a mess.",The Break-Up
120,Paddy-49,An unashamed vehicle for the lovely Ms Aniston,6,7 February 2007,"""The Break-Up"" is unashamedly a vehicle for Jennifer Aniston  and very well she grabs the opportunity as well. From the opening (pre credits) scene when she sashays along the gangway at the end of the ball game showing that she wears jeans better than anybody else to the scene where she is completely in the buff this is Ms Aniston at her provocative best. The other characters in the movie are really subservient to Jennifer's Brooke  even the excellent Vince Vaughn as the partner (Greg) from whom she becomes estranged (the ""break-up"" of the title). The story is inconsequential and the action almost non-existent as we see some predictable mini plots unfold mainly as a chance for a few cameos from fading stars like Judy Davis and Ann-Margaret. But it is Jennifer Aniston around whom the film rotates and for whom there are unlimited chances to show off her considerable attributes.The curious thing about the film is that there are only two reasons why the savvy art dealer, almost preppy Brooke would have shacked up with the slightly obese vulgarian bus tour guide Greg. The first is that he makes her laugh, and we do see a bit of that. Vaughn is a good comic actor. The other is that he is very good indeed in the sack. Brook would not be the first classy young(ish) woman to be swept off her feet by a master of the bedroom arts. But the odd kiss apart you would not know that Brook and Greg have a sex life at all. Not in the visuals, nor in the script. And in honesty you don't really buy into the existence of a hot passionate relationship either. It just doesn't seem to be there. Later in the film when Brook meets an a handsome, rich and middle to upper class hunk (Ivan Sergei) you could be believe that they fancy a role in the hay together  but that is much less easy to believe with Brooke and Greg.This film is a product and a pretty successful one too. It won't make you think or even stimulate you at all very much. But there are worse things to do than spending 105 minutes watching the delectable Jennifer Aniston in her Generra Jeans, in her beautiful evening dress - or in nothing at all.",The Break-Up
121,Buff2001,WARNING!!! Romantic Comedy Lovers STAY HOME!!!,1,2 June 2006,"Hollywood has sunk to new lows when they manage to turn even a ""romantic comedy"" into a huge dreadful waste of time. I like romantic comedies. I like the predictability and feel good enjoyment. The difference between them lies in the writing, situations, settings, gimmicks and especially the chemistry between the stars.Break-up scores a big fat ZERO on all counts. The pairing of Vaughn and Anniston on screen simply does not work. It does not help that the entire movie is played more like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"" than say ""You've Got Mail."" I simply cannot imagine the alleged off screen romance of the two.Try this for a perspective. I have never walked out of a movie in my life, especially a romantic comedy. If I was not sitting in the center of an aisle, I would have left this one about half way through if not sooner. I continued to increasingly suffer until thankfully it abruptly ended. I only saw the first credit as there was really no credit to be passed out for this horrible mess.",The Break-Up
122,Mr_Mirage,A little too close to home,9,12 June 2006,"I have a feeling that the reason this film isn't doing very well has more to do with the ad campaign, which suggests it is a comedy. It has its funny moments, lots of them, but it also has scenes of almost pain inducing drama. I can only think of ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?"" with Taylor/Burton when I last saw two people tear into each other with such vitriol.I kept wondering where Jennifer Anniston learned how to go for the throat like that...Having been in relationships that included arguments like the ones shown in this movie, and having been one of the unfortunate audience members in real life when other couples have had similar arguments, I can say that while the fights ring true, they are sometimes too real for a 10 rating.What is missed in the complaints of the ending, though, is the dead on comedy in the film. There are moments not only Laugh Out Loud, but long, continued and building laughter... one joke runs into another, then another, and when the jokes start jamming, the facial expressions take the comedy to another level.",The Break-Up
123,eckhouse24,The Break Up!,5,29 June 2006,"The Break-Up-Possible Spoilers! The Break-Up stars Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston about a couple going through a break-up and the situations that they go through that are sometimes funny, sometimes sad. Vaughn is Gary Grobowski, a typical male working for his Chicago touring company shared with his two brothers who at a Cubs game, hits on Brooke (Aniston) and the two fall for each other. The two have a simple argument that turns into the end of the relationship for the both of them. The only problem is, neither one of them wants to admit their wrong and neither one of them wants to move out of their condo. So this is where the shenanigans begin.The movie is helped by an excellent supporting cast. Jon Favreau (Swingers) is the saving grace of this film. For the short time that he is on screen, it is nothing but laughs. Jason Bateman as the couple realiter and friend also puts on a funny performance. Joey Lauren Adams is perfect as Brook's best friend and Vincent D'onofrio and Cole Hauser are perfect as Gary's two brothers. D'onofrio is so perfect in his role that sometimes we forget that this movie is about two people breaking-up. But the truth is, it is.What is so upsetting is that Aniston and Vaughn have great comedic chemistry and they are believable as a couple but for some reason, it is hard care about this couple because Gary is an ass and Brooke is a perfectionist sort of that these two are both so unwilling to compromise that in reality, they should not be together, which is why the film fails, because we just don't care. What is even worst is that while one of the characters makes a last minute character change for the better, the other doesn't It also fails because as the film progresses, the laughs seem to disappear and then we are sitting back wondering how long is this film going to last. The ending seems to drag and though I liked the way the film ended, it took way to long for me even to care.With that being said, the movie did have me laughing at some parts and Jon Favreau is a scene stealer but overall, I was very disappointed.** out of ****",The Break-Up
124,peterkowalski,"I'm forgiving, but this was just too bad",1,2 August 2011,"The biggest problem I have with ""The Break-Up"" is that it's completely unclassifiable. It's definitely not a comedy (I dare you to find 5 laughable scenes) at the same time being too ridiculous to be drama. It's unrealistic, poorly directed and plain stupid. Long story short, Brooke gets hit on by Gary, they fell in love, they movie in, they are happy. Until they aren't. Mostly because Gary's character is written so poorly; he's irresponsible, lazy and childish. There's no great drama behind it - he's just an asshole and that's it. When the couple decide to break up, the real fight begins, as no one wants to move out of the condo. You'd think the situation would propose a wide variety of funny situations to use, but no. Brooke and Gary's relationship drifts somewhere in between of drama and weird, until it finally settles down on weird when Gary decides to throw an orgy in what used to be their living room to take revenge on Brooke going on a date. That's it. One feels sorry for a bad movie especially when you can feel a good plot lost somewhere in between the bad jokes and plot holes. I adore Aniston, but her talent is just sold short here.

And one has to wonder what on earth attracted this couple both in RL and in the movie in the first place as Vaughns Pick-up lines in the beginning is inane to say the least - yuck. After this unrealistic intro we are supposed to believe that they have lived happily for some years or something until the predictable break-up leads into and updated version of ""the war of the roses"" which isn't really funny - just tragic. Pretty much all of the supporting characters are caricatures who think that the movie is a comedy, whereas Aniston/Vaughn are in a drama - go figure.

They looked far too happy and weren't annoyed when one started dating a few guys or having some friends over. Not much was done to aggravate.There was nothing 'nastier or uglier' from the plot line.I did find that Vaughn's attempts were better than Aniston's efforts at jealousy.Predictable ending, needed some more effort.

A few funny spots in the script made me chuckle but it was nothing too intelligent.

130,gus120970,Breaking up is hard to do - well,7,19 August 2007,"Two other movies came to mind during the course of the Break Up. 'War of the Roses', naturally and, you might think bizarrely, 'A Streetcar named Desire'. There are definitely shades of Stanley Kowalski in Vince Vaughn's Gary Grobawski, and as Tennesse Williams' did 50 years ago, his Polish heritage is used as a short-hand for boorishness and chauvinism. The same poker game features, and if Stanley had access to an Xbox 360, we can assume he would have spent hours on it while Stella left his beers on the coffee table. Rather than shaping up to be a standard battle of the sexes (he's too lazy, she's too controlling) turns out to be the story of a woman who has made the fatal mistake of falling for the charms of that breed of noughties man child, who are little more than toned down remakes of their 1950s forebears. This realisation for the audience, and eventuality herself explains the refreshing ending, which teases you with the very potential of it being utterly conventional before both parties walk in opposite directions. Oh, and is it funny? In parts, in a restrained way, although those expecting lots of slapstick derived from two people in a state of deep dislike sharing an apartment will find it doesn't deliver in that vein. However, it was one relationship I was prepared to stick with until the bitter end.",The Break-Up

Like in the trailer when Vaughn tells Anniston, ""I can play this like Lionell Richie, baby. Because I can play this ""all night long!"" This classic Vince Vaughn, who made his career in ""Swingers"".When he shrill-screams at Anniston it's not funny, charming, tense or necessary. It just comes off badly. You sit there and feel uncomfortable. The movie, besides being a 'cash cow' for Anniston and Vaughn does not entertain. You badly want it to, but it can't pull it off.The fact that lots of people will go just because Anniston used to sleep with Pitt is misguided. First, she's not such a catch. Really. Of course, nor is Joline. Don't get me wrong. Angelina does have great fantasy lips. But the attraction stops there.Back to the movie, ""Break Up."" It won this weekend's box office.

133,brodie_kashmir,Clichéd drivel that brought down the actor's performances,4,10 July 2006,"Romantic comedies follow the same old plot cliché of two people trying to form a relationship with hilarious happenings along the way (usually in the form of slap stick and cheesy jokes). What makes The Break Up different is that it is about just that, a break up instead of a hook up. What makes it the same is that it has lame acting, tired dialogue, and weak direction.Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston play Gary Grobowski and Brooke Meyers an on the rocks couple who rent the same condo in Chicago together. As with any break up, both parties think they are in the right, and refuse to relent in the face of other guys and girls they each parade in front of the former significant other. Brooke goes so far as to prance around naked sporting a recent ""Telly Savalas"" wax job, while Gary befriends and steals away her new boy toy via video games.With humour like that, how could it go wrong? Well there's the lack of any discernible chemistry between Vaughn and Aniston, for one thing. They may be good off screen, but on screen it was just painful to watch. This was exceptionally prevalent in Vaughn. He's shown time and time again his knack for comedy in Wedding Crashers, Old School and Swingers, so my only deduction for this unfunny anomaly in his filmography is the costar, Jennifer Aniston.And Aniston. Why do you still play Rachel (Friends)? I realize that was the launching pad for your career, and you only quit playing her two years ago, but it's time to move past that. These are feature films, not a television show, different kind of acting. Stretch your range a bit. Some people are still rooting for you to do well. Leave Rachel behind, and focus on what makes Brook be Brooke. And if you can't find any difference between Rachel and a movie character, don't pick the script.When Peyton Reed hit the scene in 2000 with the surprisingly funny Bring It On, I must admit I had high hopes for him, as did many critics. It was a novice outing with a funny teen film as the first major studio film, in the vein of Cameron Crowe, Kevin Smith and Richard Linklater. And maybe those three respected filmmakers set the bar too high for him to reach. Since Bring It On it's been a painful fall from grace, and this is just another low blow to his career.I'd comment more on the writing, but it's been a month since I've seen it, and I blocked most of the dialogue from my memory. But I do remember that it generally went ""fault of hisfault of hers she's a bitch he's a bastard"" only dragged out for an excruciating hour and 45 minutes. Throw in a few emotional breakthroughs and that's the film in a nutshell.Breaking the mold of an already faulty genre does not an instant classic make. It just means it's an unusual addition to the faulty genre, rather than an exception. And Reed should have paid closer attention to the romantic comedies that Linklater (Before Sunrise), Crowe (Jerry Maguire) and Smith (Chasing Amy) made following their teen flicks. The devil is in the dialogue, and more attention should have been paid attention to it. Oh, and casting the right people for the parts, rather than the flavours of the month. That really helps too.",The Break-Up

I suggest that Vince never wrote another movie, Vince he is good actor but don't be another good actor that wrote a screenplay and make a good movie like Owen Wilson (and you know the movie nominated for two Oscars including best original screenplay that I said) ''The Break-Up'' are very disappointing for the 3 reasons that I write here",The Break-Up
135,Duzniak38,A Very Good RomCom,7,3 August 2006,"The Break-Up is a very enjoyable movie, which basically follows the lives of Brooke and Gary, a couple whose relationship is breaking apart because of Gary's poor efforts to appreciate his partner. The Break-Up is not your usual clichéd fluffy chick flick, which is a change for once and a nice breath of fresh air in it's genre. Jennifer Anniston and Vince Vaughn both play their roles to perfection; Anniston as the fed-up overworked houseworker/artist who doesn't get any help around the house from her partner. He doesn't help her to clean the dishes, he won't take her out to places she enjoys like the ballet, he buys the incorrect gifts and products for her and he doesn't appreciate how much she works for him and has appalling please's and thank you's. And Vaughn plays the lazy male partner who can't compliment his girlfriend, very well. He is a great actor at complaining and delivers his lines and scenes brilliantly. So, after a large meal with both Brooke and Gary's family, in which the couple argue their way through, Brooke has had enough of Gary's slobbish ways. The way he ignores her, and just wants to play video games and watch the match without helping her at all. Anyway as the arguments ensue, we begin to feel sympathetic for each character in a different light. First we feel sorry for Brooke because of how much she is put through, without any support around the house from Gary. Then as Brooke begins to spite Gary and try to make him feel down, so he will come back to her, (by her dating other men), we feel a little upset for Gary. Then, as the film develops we discover that both of them are now going to have to try and fight to keep their condo. Gary moves out his bedroom and lives in the living room on the sofa bed, while Brooke lives and sleeps in the bedroom. Division and fighting continues throughout the home. They continue to squabble about things such as what they can and can't do and where they can and can't go. For the next few weeks, Brooke and Gary try to upset and annoy each other. Brooke tries to date men in order to get Gary jealous and to try and win him back over envy. But she never quite wins the situation and never quite finds the right guy to get Gary back to her. Meamwhile Gary just lazes around the living room, doesn't clean up for himself and he buys a pool table to annoy Brooke, after their arguing over the fact that they can't have one. He also has a poker night in which he brings strippers home. This game of fighting in order to annoy one another provides plenty of laughs and great lines and scenes for the audience, and also works by helping wound their relationship even further, and making their division even wider. After a mishap of the two trying to host a 'game night,' in which Gary has bitter feeling for some of Brooke's friends who betrayed him after the split, Brooke and Gary's friend, who is also a Realtor, decides to help them sell the house and split their money so they can go their separate ways. Emotions and feelings start to play on the audience. We see how far the two have drifted apart, and feel completely sorry for Brooke's character, who only wanted to be loved by her husband, and after their split, wanted nothing than to be together again. Brooke then invites Gary for one last concert, hoping that they can mend some of the cuts in their split. But after he never shows, Brooke has had enough. She cries in front of Gary and spells out how all she ever wanted from him was appreciation. Gary feels sorry for her, and feels ashamed, but cannot fix what has been broken between them. After Gary cleans the condo and cooks a meal for the two of them, he tells Brooke his true love for her, but she doesn't feel the same. The two never get back together but the film ends on a smiley, happy note, as the two meet a year or so later, and are still good friends. The acting, as I have mentioned before, is on top form. The two leads play their drama so excellently, you would find it hard to believe the two aren't a real couple. Excellent characters also include Judy Davis as Marilyn, the rather eccentric artist who provides great comical value and John Michael Higgins as Richard, the crazy gay brother of Brooke, who once again adds some comedy on the side of this rather serious drama between the two leads. The script is good, with plenty of jokes, especially from Vaughn who is never a let down at delivering the humour while acting completely serious. The sets are rather nice, the condo is an attractive place. The soundtrack was nothing special and pretty unforgettable.

136,anderbilt,"fantastic movie, well focused plot",9,16 October 2007,"may contain spoilers anyway.I rate this movie high because Vaughan and Anniston hit the precisely right chemistry for THIS part of a relationship, the death-throe.Some here have expressed disappointment because it didn't show the early days of the romance, or the good times Gary and Brooke enjoyed; that's a different and much longer movie folks.What we have is a movie that cuts to the chase: The Breakup. We presume the depth of the feeling between the two because they've broached that big trust wall, the pooling of material possessions. BUT the relationship has stalled at its biggest hurdle, the sharing of one-ness as a 'couple.' Gary's immaturity prevents it, Brooke's inability to articulate her needs makes it worse, and her gambit to force him to appreciate her comes to its inevitable conclusion.Outstanding performances and a well filmed and well told story, just the right size and shape, it gets the job done nicely. Very memorable.",The Break-Up

Yeh there is a sense of realism to it, but come on...its just boring.The actors were too good for the story line and they should have realised what a crap script it was.Advise not to watch it, if your looking for comedy this ain't the one for you.

138,Nolamoviedude,"Fast talking, lazy Vince Vaughn breaks up with the gorgeous Jennifer Anniston",4,12 February 2019,"Vince Vaughn has made millions by using the formula that worked for screwball comedies in the 1940's; say a lot of words really fast and it will be considered funny. It works but he does the same routine over and over and it's getting played out.Gary(Vaughn) meets Brooke (Jennifer Anniston) at a Cubs game. He annoyingly bothers her about a hot dog so much that she eventually agrees to go out with him. It works because we fast forward and they own a condo together. He's part owner of a tour guide company in Chicago, he's lazy and is basically a 40 year old frat boy. She works as a art gallery curator and is more cultured. They break up but neither is willing to move out of the condo until they can sell it. She actually wants him back and tries to get him to see the error of his ways. He's a slob, fat, lazy, and disrespectful. He should be trying to get her back. He even stands her up when she's trying to make amends at the end and he stands her up. He realizes the error of his ways towards the end but it's too late. She goes on a long trip and a long time passes and they bum into each other on the street. Then it ends. Decent Rom-Com with a few funny spots but it doesn't follow the formula, NO HAPPY ENDING.A few funny moments and quotes I liked:"" I'm not say he won't get married. I'm not even saying he won't have kids. I'm just saying 1 day his wife will come home and a guy named Julio are clubbing each other to Yanni's greatest hits""- when talking about Brooke's possibly gay brother""Is that how you want to play it?

139,forrestwrs,Depressingly Short On Laughs,2,13 September 2010,"I'm sick of these kinds of movies I really am. I'm sick of them. Every year, we get a slew of movies exactly like this one. A romantic comedy with a gimmick. The gimmick can be anything. They met online. They're different races. Their families don't get along. This time, they're breaking up but neither wants out of the apartment they share. Why is this entertainment? It's like watching divorce court or Judge Judy. By the way, in real life, this whole manner would have been taken to a judge who can make a clear cut decision on the matter.Jennifer Anniston and Vince Vaughn I have always admired as actors, but they have little on screen chemistry here. Which one could argue is fine because the characters are breaking up, but no scene with the two of them together really rises to much at the end of the day.The dialogue is cheesy, the set up is only so-so, but nothing about it is memorable. Maybe it's because there have already been so many variants on this kind of movie before that by the time I get to this one, nothing's new. Nothing's genuine. Nothing grasps my attention. Nothing stands out. It's not like it's impossible to write good romantic comedies. It just needs to start with a talented screenwriter. We don't get that here.The Break-Up is also depressingly short on laughs, which is awful considering the talent that's on the screen. I know both of these actors have what it takes to play decent roles. Why aren't they given any? Generic, slightly clichéd, overly used, nothing special, nothing new, and lazily put together, The Break-Up is a forgettable waste of time.2/10",The Break-Up
140,bloodymonday,Mini review: The Break-Up,1,13 June 2008,"Do you know what is worse than seeing some crap movies? It's seeing a crap movie with your emotion already attached to it. This is 100+ minutes of agony and pain that I cannot take it back. Some people think that it's a fresh take on comedy-drama that while we laugh, we can actually learn something from it. Oh boy, you guys are so wrong! All I see is a couple of self-centered human being (especially you, Vince) who simply can't grow up just a single bit (yeah, they eventually grew up, but.....come on!!). And the ending, are we supposed to believe in that s**t? My dream ending would be Jennifer shot Vince in the head with a shotgun for being such a d**k. And then, shot herself with the same gun for being foolish enough to fall in love with that guy.",The Break-Up
141,oliver-123,"Not a comedy, but not really intended to be?",6,14 November 2006,"The categories for classifying films tend to be pretty broad, but this certainly should not have been billed as a romantic comedy. In fact, I did not find much to laugh at: often it was too painful, and the 'funny' minor characters did not actually provide much light relief. I personally feel the two stars did a good job of portraying their characters (interestingly, the commentary makes clear that quite a lot of the dialogue was improvised, by them and others), though Jennifer Aniston's was less fully imagined, I think. But there was a basic flaw: it was very difficult to see how these two characters could have developed a sufficiently strong relationship to move in together, without having perceived their basic incompatibility. The fact that Gary expects to be able to support Brooke so she doesn't 'have to work' reflects a difference in approach that would surely have become apparent very early on, for instance. That said, the portrayal of the break-up seemed well done, to me - and of course there was a lot of shouting, that's what people do in a break-up.Add to this that the minor characters often did not come across very well (and could be irritating when they did, like Brooke's brother and Gary's younger brother), that we have quite a long scene with Johnny O talking of having something done to Gary's supposed rival that is pointless, because there is has no sequel at all, and other things, the result is a film that only really entertains occasionally. At least they went with an ending that, while basically positive, did not have them kiss and make up (and thank heavens they chose this ending rather than the alternate, a bonus on the DVD, which had the lame concept that each is now dating someone who looks like their ex, and entirely too much cringe-making singing by Brooke's brother's group).",The Break-Up

It is a really funny film, with a serious side. The ending was also great and unpredictable.The Cons Nothing in particular.Final Word The Break Up is not a chick flick and it is thankfully not a romantic comedy.

144,shadowycat,"Rated ""M"" for Misogyny.",5,1 June 2006,"We caught a screening of 'The Breakup'.I don't like romantic comedy/chick flicks. That said, the first part of the film's non-relationship-ish parts were funny. And to be fair this one isn't really a chick flick. The truly comedic parts are all early on, while the later scenes rocked back and forth between TMI and schmaltz city.There's some great shots of Chicago -- but OMG SO embarrassingly white. I think I counted no more than two African-American extras anywhere at anytime in the film.. oh - and the BUS DRIVER was African-American. Chicago is a vibrant multicultural city, this was way too Beaver Cleaver white! Jennifer Aniston plays quite the flawed character as Brooke Meyers. There's a fine line between funny and just basically unpleasant when you're dealing with a flawed character. She's a controlling, histrionic martyr, driven to the point of OCD. The story exploits these shallow neurotic shortcomings to the point where all I could do was feel sorry for Vince Vaughn. Oh Vince baby, you couldn't have seen that coming! Vince Vaughn's Gary is no prize, but there isn't a mean bone in his body. I liked the ease with which he captures the tacit, feckless, and unintentionally self-centered oblivion of so many American men. Theirs is a mild-mannered selfishness. And I'm bothered by the disparity between how accurate and hard-hitting his portrayal is, while hers is painted with such broad, cruel strokes. Imagine a bunch of guys sat around and concocted a story: ""So like, this smokingly hot chick comes into your life and everything is going' great until everything flips upside down when she goes psycho on your ass..."" I strongly suspect that any likable facets of the Brooke Meyers character are probably just Jennifer Aniston's real self shining through to override the stilted facade her character represents. Poor Jen, she did the best she could with what she got, but it's SUCH a misogynistic script.Brooke Meyers is a caricature... I hear a growly announcer voice whisper ""... When Girlfriends Go Nuts..."" Brooke's friend Maddie's role is paper thin, and Ann-Margret? She flashes by on screen with an over-botoxed sneer -- OMG what a tease! She's got over the line billing but ends up as little more than a background player! There are other women in the cast. Our struggling couple hold a game night, and there's a girl in the kitchen who is addressed with the line ""Hey what did you say your name was?"" There's a couple of girls who get insulted in a bar, and some skanky dancer girls who strip and shimmy, but the majority of on screen women in this film have little or nothing to say.The one commanding female role in this picture is that of Marilyn Dean. Judy Davis gives all as ""M. Dean"", the glowering gallery owner Brooke works for. Imagine a storybook, mythic fairy godmother dressed in urbane chic. Hers is an intriguing character study; but while compelling, this woman is ultimately disparaged: her big heart overwhelmed by a distasteful measure of eccentricity. She's a little scary, in that aggressive taut and overbearing manner some ""women of a certain age"" attain. Sadly, her loyalty is the only clue of any redeeming value within Brooke -- the Marilyn Deans of our planet don't waste time otherwise.The broad stroke message is that women are either insipid or scary, no middle ground.I read that Vince Vaughn wrote this story with Jennifer Aniston in mind before they'd ever met. I'm thinking the writers did their best to present an honest case, and their misogyny is as unintentional as is the character Gary's inertia and self-involvement. I'm also thinking that post Pitt, she was probably in the same kind of headspace I was in after breaking up with the love of MY LIFE. I didn't sign up for a misogynistic movie (I'm not an actress) no no... all I did was get myself involved with a gender-dysphoric alcoholic bank robber who was on the lam.I'm sure Jennifer Aniston believed she was portraying a cute, funny, and well-intented woman. I think she did her best to humanize Brooke Myers, and overall, the picture works even if I didn't like it. However, if I was Jennifer Aniston, I think I'd be feeling a little used, a little cheap and dirty. Kind of like a bad taste in one's mouth. Poor Jen. Maybe this picture is like, the cinematic rebound.",The Break-Up
145,songbirdmc,Mixed feelings,5,14 July 2018,"As per usual this movie was marketed as a comendy and IT ISN'T. Why do they wish to mislead the audience so much!? Duh! Because they want us to spend money on the movie even if it means that we regret it! I remember my sister and I were absolutely starving for a good comedy and the previews looked somewhat promising and I'm a fan of Jennifer Aniston and I guess you could say Vince Vaughn as well. I swear as I was sitting in the theater I kept expecting it to take a turn that would put it on the track I expected it to go on. But it never does. You would think something unexpected would be good, but it isn't.Sadly, this movie is sad. S A D. First, because of the breakup and then the heartache that follows, but also because of the comedy that was attempted and failed horribly. I found myself thinking will this scene ever end!? Multiple times. It's just going and going and going and they expect us to find it funny, but it's actually horrible and painful to sit through. Speaking of painful -that ending! What even was that? They left it so open to interpretation. I really wish they would have given us more of an idea of whether or not they would possibly reconcile. I'm guessing not. I really hate movies that don't have a definitive ending.I wanted to love it, but unfortunately I didn't even like it.",The Break-Up
146,JonSnowsMother,Not a single good joke at all,4,14 January 2008,After i saw it i was wondering whether i just saw a comedy or a crap drama. It was another crap performance by Vince Vaughn. It has a stupid story line to what's the point on making a film about two people who broke up with each other. Obviously the ending would have been predictable. And would have had a very predictable ending.(which it had) But what most people would have wanted to see was good jokes and no surprise no good jokes. Beside the two stars Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston(Rarely have impressive performances) but it has actors like Justin Long-Dodgeball Vincent D'Onofrio-Full Metal Jacket. One stupid bit is that the women dose not want to break up with the boyfriend just wants him to clean the dishes i mean thats so stupid.

147,DennisH,Spend an evening with The Bickersons...,6,10 June 2006,"I can't take credit for the summary name, that came from a friend, but there cannot be a more appropriate subject for these comments.This film is a collection of some well-delivered funny jokes surrounded in a quagmire of contrived fights, dreary supporting characters, and a series of unrealistic decisions.Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston are both charismatic in their performances, but the screenplay diverts their personas to those of rather ugly people (especially Aniston).The fights are started by the standard rom-com arguments that the man doesn't understand what the woman wants, and that he is too insensitive to her needs. The trigger of the argument is ridiculous. Vince forgets the number of lemons she wants for a table centerpiece, and for this atrocious reason, Aniston says we need to break up. Fights ensue where they play their friends against each other, while secretly confiding to their friends that they want each other back. Both use other people to make the other feel worse, and their friends provide absolutely horrid advice until it's over, and then the friends say how they should have been more understanding of their partner.Notice I use the actor's names, one facet I could not ignore was that I never differentiated the stars from their parts. The supporting characters, in general, were awful. Even Vincent D'Onofrio (one of my favorite actors). Cole Hauser was rather funny, but whoever played the owner of the art gallery, as well as the receptionist, were miscast and not needed.In short, save your time, the jokes, though funny, are not worth the incredibly slow third act that had a tacked-on denouement (try typing that word) to satisfy the test audiences.6/10 stars, and that's only for Favreau's funny asides.",The Break-Up

150,Lemos,"No, no! This is definitely not your usual teen romantic comedy",8,10 November 2006,"I can understand why many, led by certain expectations they have of the usual Jennifer Aniston roles, might have found this a tad uncomfortable. This movie is a cynical but unfortunately quite truthful, very grown-up, very bitter-sweet romantic comedy. The chemistry between the two stars is natural and genuine, deep down it is very heart-felt; not your usual lovy-dovy, mushy stuff. The two share something special, but in a world where it is difficult to let go of one's selfishness and personal space, a war of attrition starts-up and eventually spirals out of control because neither partners are willing to give in to the other, both materially and emotionally, to what in essence are two domineering individual personalities. I also think it's a genuine on screen first, a confession of sorts, on how the modern, emancipated, far more mature female psyche really thinks and in the end manipulates many a relationship. This come at a hefty cost: the end of many a good relationship, and the real emotional conflicts that many women endure with this type of stereotypical insensitive and immature alpha male behaviour, but most of the time, totally oblivious to women's feelings, bloke reactions. It's a Women from Venus, Men from Mars cinematic interpretation.",The Break-Up

Vince Vaughn tries to relate by being the ""average Joe"" and works in parts, but in others he's just making us ""guys"" feel guilty...not good considering you're paying to see a film which makes you feel bad. In fact, the film basically revolves around the 2 characters trying to get the other annoyed or jealous so that they will end the argument...but all they end up doing is either getting hurt or making the other even more furious.The ending is definitely surprising, and serves as the only highlight in this film...expect no clichéd Hollywood ending where everyone lives happily ever after,...but still, the ending isn't worth watching the entire film for.Chance it if you will, but bets are you will be disappointed. 5/10",The Break-Up

Vince's look at the end of the song was priceless.Other than that there are quite few laughs here. All the fighting between the main characters quickly becomes too much and there is not enough substance or character development here to make the serious parts of this movie believable.So basically, this one is a slightly amusing comedy that fails in its attempts to reflect any serious parts of a failing relationship.The ending is a little bit strange.

It's not quite sure what it wants to be. It also a wee bit overwrought, whiny, and too long. And it's not fair to Jen as Vince Vaughn makes himself the more lovable character (from the male perspective anyhow). The mainstream critics hated the movie but enjoyed the supporting actors. I actually felt that Vince and Jennifer did a pretty good job although it's hard to see what attracted them to each other in the first place and that they could stay together for 2 years before the big fight.However, and this is big however there are certain scenes that really hit relationships right on the money. Real dialog by real people. Plus the lousy, contradictory, and conflicting advice that they each receive from their best friends is poignant, realistic, and painful.People have commented that it's ""The Break Up"" it wasn't meant to be funny but the closing scene wimps out on what typically happens in the rocky road to breaking up.Vincent D. is great in a minor supporting role.I recommend it, if you're not expecting a comedy, and recognize that the screenwriters/director were trying to do the impossible.",The Break-Up

Although this could be a refreshing subject, it's not always something you're in the mood for. The design of the poster suggested a romantic comedy so I expected it to be full of clichés. And how interesting can a story be when it's about everyday stereotypical fights that men and women have... Well, it wasn't.The first half of this movie was downright boring. If anything, it reminded me of real-life situations in which people were fighting and others stood by in awkward silence. By chance, I saw the episode of the Simpsons in which Milhouse's parents fight and want a divorce right before I watched this movie. And it had the exact same 'dinner party with Pictionary' scene in it!So the first half of the movie made me feel awkward and bored. I didn't get why these people ended up together in the first place. His attempts to win her were kind of creepily obsessive and pushy... As the audience, you obviously think he's a selfish prick (with both all the realistic and all the over the top absurd male clichés thrown at you). But then they do the same for the female main character and you don't really care anymore. You don't even want them to get back together. It was basically two children trying to make each other jealous, anyway.Still, this movie has something to offer that made me rate it 5: - It made me curious about the ending, although I didn't really care. - It was pretty cool how the dull and ridiculous bald guy actually turns out to be the one telling his friend Gary the truth. - It was surprising to see the self-centered boss of Brooke somehow turn into a likable lady.But the biggest reason to give this utterly boring movie 5 stars is: My partner spontaneously started doing the dishes after watching it. Whether it was the impact of the movie on his conscience or the sudden exciting appeal of the dishes after watching a boring movie, I don't know. But I guess it pays off, in a way. ;)",The Break-Up

They took pages not only from a myriad of other date movies but from movies in the two star's past. Case and point, Vince and his video game addiction is right out of Swingers. The biggest problem is the paper thin script they have to work with. Vince is not a guy you would want to make things work out with and his character is given few consolations. This movie will strike a chord with the young ones, or anyone who has novice relationship experience. Anyone whose been around for some time will quickly be bored, yet the movie is fairly watchable due to Jenny from the block. She nose how to make a scene look good.

158,Bigbang,Decent drama ruined by stupid comedy,4,3 December 2006,"The dramatic bits in this movie I thought were much better than the loud obnoxious comedy. This should have been a drama with some comedy sprinkled in, it would have worked much better. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston were clearly up to the task because their acting was pretty good during the dramatic parts, if a little over the top.Every other character in ""The Break-Up"" was an obnoxious clown. Why does everyone have to yell or talk too loud? Yelling your lines doesn't equal funny. The male characters were borderline retarded as usual. The females were basically non-existent besides Aniston. The only character who acted like a normal human being was the one guy of course Aniston didn't seem to like romantically. Figures.The A Capella group was one of the most awful, tortuous things I ever seen or heard. Vince Vaughn can be funny, but mostly when he calms down for two seconds, which doesn't happen too often. Why did these two like each other in the first place? They had zero chemistry or anything in common. The only time they were happy is in photographs at the beginning of the movie. That's all we have to go on to establish their relationship. Otherwise the entire movie these two despise each other. So the whole premise of the movie makes no sense. There's no tension since they hate each other anyway, who cares if they get back together.Very few people in the movie business knows how to write dialog. Every director and screenwriter should be required to watch the movie ""Before Sunset"" with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. You want to hear great dialog? That's it. I saw that movie recently and basically most movies now seem worthless and stupid in comparison, including this one.",The Break-Up

The reason why I was left content with the film: The fights! Oh, the fights! It drove me nuts but I loved it. The ending was suiting and unlike the viewer might suspect. I supposed it lacked some sharp humour for me and it wasn't bold enough. I wont forget to mention the very cool Vince Vaughn who pulls off some good acting, & Jennifer Aniston who I just adore.

160,maccaveili,"Guys, not just a date movie, hilarious",10,2 July 2006,"*********** Contains spoilers ************OK I had written my reviewbelow, but after reading everyone elses', felt the need to add something here first. The most refreshing thing about this movie is the ending. The fact that it didn't have the ""Hollywood ending"" where everything is forgiven and everyone goes on to live happily ever after was a surprise, and a good one at that. The whole movie Jennifer Anniston's character tries and tries to get her ex (Vince Vaughn) back by making him jealous, etc, but by the time he comes around and sees the error of his ways, she's already too burnt out to give it another chance. With that said, I still thought towards the end ""oh here comes the Hollywood ending now"", but it didn't happen, which to me was REFRESHING! Yes they ended up running into each other by chance on the streets months later and were on good speaking terms, but that was it. Now ladies and gentlemen, that is realistic, not Hollywood, thank you for not making them end up together after it was all said and done.For those of you who complained that this movie hit too close to the heart, get over it! C'mon now, I've been through more than one painful breakup in my life, and it didn't bother me one bit. Break ups happen, get over it. For those of you who felt you were mislead by the advertisement that it was a romantic comedy, get over it. It was called the break up, what did you expect? Did you think it would be like ""Must love dogs"" or what? It was called the break up!!!! Need I repeat that again. Anyone who was bothered by this movie, really needs to lighten up, and I'd imagine those who were, were probably women. I can't think of any men I know who would say something like that. It was funny, because all of us men, know that at some point in time, we've been that idiot that Vaughn plays in the movie. It was funny to watch someone other than ourselves be that guy. It's a movie people, a movie. It wasn't a documentary, so spare me the grief. Yes they made Vince Vaughn's character a little dense when it came to figuring out what he was doing wrong, but other than that, I thought he played it up well.********** END OF SPOILERS *************** The great thing about this movie is that any red blooded American guy who has ever been in a relationship or lived with a woman can relate to its humor. I saw a lot of myself in that movie, albeit in the movie everything was over exaggerated, but still, I found myself laughing because at some point in time or another that was me. The acting in it wasn't bad, better than I expected, then again I love Vince Vaughn. Yes it was a movie about relationships, but still, it's the kind of movie that either you and your significant other could watch together, or just a group of guys could watch and get a good laugh out of. Unlike other comedies, this movie actually has serious moments that we can all relate to, but overall it's a comedy all the way, and I gave it two thumbs up for acting by both Jennifer Anniston (whom I don't even like that much, but did a GREAT job) and Vaughn. Definitely would recommend seeing it in the theater.",The Break-Up
161,rcbbo,Chick flick,4,3 June 2006,"Very disappointing. I really expected more out of a Vince Vaughn written movie. This is not a romantic comedy as it is portrayed to the public...this is a chick flick with one laugh.Very dull, at times helplessly sad, and an odd ending which awards you more questions than answers.I will give Vince Vaughn credit for one thing...he did create an ending that is not very predictable from what you see on the commercials.Still, don't waste your time or money. A below average movie that did not achieve the label of ""Romanitc Comedy"" The one positive was that we got to see Jennifer Aniston's back side for about two seconds ;)",The Break-Up
162,slofstra,Great script,7,3 November 2006,"The male-female relationship dynamics as portrayed in this movie are spot on. It's not easy to write realistic and interesting dialogue, at least it would appear that way based on the formulaic and banal stuff Hollywood often subjects audiences too. So this movie starts with a script that's very realistic and very interesting 'in the small', maybe like a Chekhov play. The overall story arc is not as strong, and the plot drags in the middle somewhat - going around the same circle several times, as Jennifer tries several ploys to get Vince back. Still, this movie is a cut above the rest. Up there with other great relationship flicks like When Harry Met Sally or Walk the Line. This movie is bound to spark an interesting conversation with whoever you might see it.",The Break-Up
163,filmdolly,More War of the Roses than When Harry Met Sally.............,7,4 June 2006,"*********************Possible Spoiler Alert****************************For once, the trailers did not totally give away all the plot points for a movie and many are very cranky about it. I am a huge fan of the romantic comedy and let me assure this wasn't one. It was far more War of the Roses than When Harry Met Sally. There were many funny moments and situations in this movie, but they and the romance were not the main focus of this film. The main theme was on The Break-Up. I guess the ending should be no surprise to anyone. Many have stated that is was anti-climatic, but at least they don't end up dead like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. It was a far more realistic ending than many. I am not a big fan of the realistic ending either, but this one I could live with. It left you with a feeling of promise, ambivalence and dare I say hope. The performances by all were entertaining and had some depth. Don't get me wrong there were many hysterical exchanges and situations. My favorite was the Tone Rangers practicing in Brooke's bedroom while Gary tries to sleep. I believe that there are many women that can relate to Brooke's frustration over Gary's total inability to ""get it"". When he finally gets it, it is too little too late. It's amazing that Gary has a huge support system that all cater to his whims and needs. It's no wonder that he wasn't ready for the relationship Brooke wanted. This was no romantic comedy, but it was a solid, black comedy.",The Break-Up
164,lkl6411,Decent romantic comedy/drama,7,3 June 2006,"My husband and I went to see this film on its opening night and weren't surprised to see a full theatre.The movie has its hilarious moments which are interspersed with plenty of uncomfortable, tense arguments as these 2 people who love one another try to one-up each other in the payback mode for the pain in their relationship.My husband thought it dragged from the middle on a little, although I didn't.We both left thinking the movie was really funny in some parts, pretty sad and even tragic in others. Overall, we thought the acting was solid & believable and though the ending wasn't expected, it was real and even hopeful.We both said it was worth seeing, and if you're looking for a fairly real-life view of the life of a struggling relationship, you'll be glad you saw this film.I left the theatre feeling a little empty, but glad that in real life, these two are together!! Enjoy!",The Break-Up
165,El_Guapo9,Intense realism,6,30 June 2006,"Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston's on-screen chemistry isn't really all that great. Luckily for them, that's a huge part of this movie. I'll admit that the trailers for this movie were misleading. They made the film look like a laugh-filled comedy, which it definitely is not. The film is a solid drama with great realism and some laughs mixed in. The story wanders a little at times and seems to drag at times, but it really is a compelling character study as the two leads break apart and their relationship spirals with it.I liked the movie but I could have liked it a lot more and with all the awkward situations I'm not sure it's one I'd like to see again. The film is very realistic and is definitely worth a watch.6 out of 10.",The Break-Up
166,kidboi,"So, what was this film trying to achieve?",3,14 September 2006,"I'm sorry, but i just don't seem to understand, what is the damn goal that this film is trying to achieve? Is it trying to teach us about love, forgiveness? I wouldn't know, because i almost fell asleep. 'The Break-Up' is an extremely dull film, with very little entertaining values. There is basically nothing original about this film. The only thing this film does is... well.. it just is. At some places it tries to be funny, yet serious, but nothing in the film works, it barely works as a relationship drama, and it fails as a romantic comedy. It didn't wake any emotion, at least, not for me.The trailer for the film is so misleading it's not even funny. Basically all the funny moments in the trailer are all the funny moments in the entire film. Seriously! The acting is average, Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston are playing themselves, as always. Ablosutely nothing stands out in the film. After walking out of the theater i was extremely confused and just didn't understand why such a movie was even made.See this film, if you don't want to use sleeping pills.3/10",The Break-Up

Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston in this movie you love to hate them. They both did very well in this movie. Vince Vaughn is hilarious and Jennifer Aniston finally gains my respect in the movies. She is perfect in this role and the things she does to Vince Vaughn is very hurtful but thats why its called the break Up. I don't know why but this movie just works. Its very funny, good story line, and the ending will shock you. Go see this movie Great flick finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!See it",The Break-Up
168,JoeJames76,Not quite how the trailers sold it,7,24 January 2007,"It is extremely frustrating when a studio deceives you by selling a film as something it is not. The Break-Up is NOT a laugh a minute comedy of he said/she said. It is not the playful battle of the sexes so guiltily enjoyed in Peyton Reed's previous film Down With Love. It is, however, an enjoyable (that's perhaps not the right word) take on the part of a relationship we rarely see in an otherwise romantic comedy.Centering a film on the ugly side of dating is a risky task, which is why it is understandable that the studio would try to sell the ""hilarity"" of incompatibility. Yet by doing so, the film's trailer really sells short the strength that this film has as a dramatic rendering of an adult relationship gone sour.Vaughn and Aniston give strong, believable performances as a couple in crisis. Their attraction and chemistry is right, in that you can see these two hooking up, but not exactly hitching up. Neither one deserves the other, as both display their worst faults as their relationship devolves. A strong supporting cast plays their pals caught in the crossfire, with some funny results and some ridiculous mugging at times. Reed does a fine job of hitting the right notes, though the jump between comedy and drama can be a little jarring.The film tries to realistically deal with a couple's break-up, yet finds truth in the dialogue more often than it does in the actions of its characters. Some honest reactions spill forth from the mouths of the hurt, confused couple dealing with their emotions, but their over-the-top responses by way of making grand purchases and throwing away their hard earned lives and bodies at a whim seem less real and more made in Hollywood.Still, in the end, without the misleading theatrical trailer and real life romance (and prior break-ups) of the two leads, the film is convincing and entertaining. Just expect a lot more screaming than laughing.Grade: B",The Break-Up
169,super16,Is There A Script Doctor In The House?,2,29 June 2007,"The film has a number of very good performances, some good Chicago locations and generally good set design, and is otherwise technically well made from a behind the camera standpoint but gets a low grade on the basis of the story and script. This review is based on the DVD, not a theatrical presentation, so I will reference some of the bonus material including the ""alternate"" ending (which should actually have been termed the originally ending on the DVD -- ""before we were forced to re-shoot it because the test audiences hated and didn't buy it!"")I could get past the initial set up of the film, which has (as Gregory House might have put it) a woman of a certain numeric rank being hit upon by a man of a far lower numeric rank) because generally movies written by guys have that as their basis all the time (which is why we see hot girls with schlubs all over movies and TV shows constantly) but also because, frankly, some women often just frankly have bad taste plus women seem to have a higher threshold with their gag reflex of what the male version of a dog is than males do about females. But once you get past that surface, as people, it's pretty clear that Brooke and Gary are wrong for each other, well before the dinner party that causes the ""final straw"" to set up the rest of the movie. This is where I think the story and script fail the audience. While the montage of snap shots between the two leads was a good way to showcase the development of their relationship, the baseball meeting (rather than meet cute) was the wrong set up, since it was really more ""meet annoying"" or ""meet obnoxious,"" One of the deleted scenes has the Vince Vaughn character helping a very attractive female buy her drink at a club (the same club which is shown in the movie itself, where Gary's brother Lupus - Cole Hauser's character - took him to help him meet women). In this deleted scene, the Gary character is funny and it is readily apparent how a women could be either entertained or charmed enough to go out on a date with him. In the opening baseball scene, in addition to being out of character for the date Brooke is with and for Brooke herself, it also fails to create the impression necessary to set up the rest of the movie.The next time you see the characters, before and at the dinner party, you clearly see they do not make a good couple for any number of reasons, certainly not good enough for the other key set up of the film -- to live together in a piece of property they both decided to purchase jointly, even prior to marriage. While the film could have been made about a apartment under rent control in say Manhattan in such a great location, neither party wanted to give it up, plus also recognizing how hard it would be to find a great apartment by themselves in the New York market. Otherwise, it's hard to understand why THIS couple would decide to live together by buying property together. Giving Gary some sort of redeeming quality would have helped. Sure, his male friends could bond with him and think he's a great guy - even a stranger who came to date a very attractive female (Brooke) could be so distracted by Gary's ability to be a great male friend that this stranger (Brooke's date, Mike) could lose out on an attractive female. But these scenes don't show Gary to be a good friend to any females, much less an attractive or appealing partnership opportunity for Brooke or any other woman. Also, again this scene is an example of how the movie is badly written. Why would Gary make nice with a more attractive guy going out with his ex within a fresh less than two weeks of his breakup, when a few days earlier, he was trying so hard to embarrass Brooke in front a less attractive (and therefore less threatening) male escort with tricks on how to get Brooke to put out or what sex scenes and sex play she was into?The script isn't strong enough for the number of points it tries to make. Some of the scenes added, especially for comedic effect, are totally unnecessary where other scenes could have been used to better effect (a key example is the entire first scene of Justin Long's character answering the phone at the art gallery). I think ultimately they decided those were needed to make the film commercially viable -- not to make it a better film. This was a possibly average to decent drama or possible decent to solid comedy that needed to be focused and sharper in story, plot and details, but also needed a script doctor to really improve the plot, something which the director was apparently not able (or possible not allowed?) to do, given his commentary on the DVD, particularly with the original ending of the movie, as written and as this director shot it, especially to end the film with a very extended musical number after the dialogue between Brooke, Gary and their respective dates at the open air festival.The alternate ending (that was released) of the film is what keeps the entire film from being a dismal bomb, something so obviously apparent, that hearing the director defend the original ending is surprising.",The Break-Up
170,whitakeroh,Horrid Garbage,3,5 June 2006,"To be quite honest, I expected a lot more from this movie than what I received. Perhaps it was my high expectations that lead to the dramatic letdown I experienced. First, the plot was as force-fed as it gets. We have a couple whom are breaking-up, yet continue to live together whilst Jennifer Anniston has her uh, private parts shaved and then walks around naked for vaughn to see?!? I mean, that made no sense. Then, the reason they supposedly ""break-up"" is so ridiculous. Vaughn comes into the house and loves on anniston then they fight b/c he doesn't like how she wants 12 lemons? To understand what I am saying here, you must see this movie, it really makes no sense. Further, Vaughn treats her like complete garbage (and I'm a guy who fights w/ his fiancé' all the time here folks) for really, as far as I could see, no reason whatsoever. The plot was just completely convoluted and all the effects in the movie had no causes. I'd also like to say that after the movie I really felt bad for Anniston (not too bad, considering the fact that she makes millions just to say a few lines and look pretty on a screen) b/c she was just completely over-taken by Vaughn, and Vaughn who I normally find funny, was so completely over-the-top ridiculous and really just exaggerated even for himself that I couldn't find any credibility with his character at all. He was constantly yelling @ Anniston for really trivial things. I mean, this is why the movie made no sense, Anniston plays a likable cute, sweetheart, yet Vaughn is screaming @ her the whole movie about everything. So, the laughs were contrived. I found the audience where I was at (which was packed) only laughed at the scenes which were in the ads on TV. So, the audience felt compelled to laugh, other than that: no laughs at all, b/c it wasn't funny. Really, this movie next week will probably have the most dramatic drop in sales amongst all movies. This movie was a HUGE LETDOWN.",The Break-Up
171,Pamela-5,Why is this movie so long?,5,28 May 2007,"I just thought the two main characters, especially the female (Jennifer Anniston's character, Brooke), didn't have much insight as to what was really happening in the relationship, and why it wasn't working, and Brooke used all the wrong words when telling Vince (Gary) why she was angry! I mean, duh, when it dawns on a woman that the male half of the relationship just doesn't care whether or not he pleases or displeases the female half, guess what? That's called indifference, which is the direct opposite of love. So what she needed to say was, ""You don't love me! It's obvious by your indifference to me and my feelings!"" When the guy doesn't give a damn, it's time to pack up and go. Seems like this point, once made, could have made the movie about 5 minutes long, instead of over an hour-and-a-half. Whenever a woman is placed in the position of ""nagging"" or ""whining,"" it means the husband / boyfriend has long since ceased giving a damn about pleasing the woman or caring about her feelings. Time to pack up and bolt! You can't fight it; it just IS. So the lady needs to take her lumps and just GO.",The Break-Up

Personally I felt that categorising this as a comedy was misleading, most of it is very bitter as vaughan and aniston fight their way out of a their relationship and there are few laughs in a poor script.The film actually comes across as more like a made for TV drama. Some of the supporting characters are too stereotyped - anistons gay friend at work, her henpecked brother in law - and sympathy for any of the characters disappears very quickly as they behave increasingly selfishly.lastly there is a weak indecisive ending.A waste of some talented people.In the unlikely event of vince vaughan or jennifer aniston reading this please could you send me the £3.50 I wasted hiring this.

What do they have in common? Not much, except somehow they fell in love. What do they see in each other?

Their relationship is believable and realistic and romantic. They fight and bicker like a real couple, then they try so hard to reconcile something that they don't know is there.Although the ambiguous ending made me a little disappointed, I would have to say this is a good one.

175,Bandit1974,The Not-So-Romantic Comedy,9,3 July 2006,"It's amazing to me that this movie received such poor reviews. I saw it today and loved it.The standard romantic comedy is to women what action movies are to men. Totally unrealistic mind candy fantasy BS. I believe that the reason The Break Up was not received very well is because people were expecting a romantic comedy yet what they really got was a movie that is very realistic in it's portrayal of a relationship gone seriously wrong.This movie is about the ugliness that comes out in all of us when we are confronted with a relationship that is destined to end. Good people behave very badly at the end of romantic relationships and that is what we see in The Break Up. Two relatively decent people acting totally irrational toward one another. Even in the midst of their behavior they know it's wrong. It's not until it's far too late do either of them realize what they've ultimately let pride destroy.The question remains, ""Yeah, but is it funny?"" It's very much a dark comedy in the same vein as War Of The Roses. It's not touchy feely in any sense of the word. That being said, you still get your classic Vince Vaughn moments. There is no other actor who can play terribly flawed yet too charming to resist the way that Vaughn can. He didn't overwhelm the movie though. Aniston does a superb job of playing the emotionally exhausted and completely disappointed significant other.My favorite role in the movie is Gary's/Vaughn's friend Johnny O, played by Jon Favreau. It's actually a speech that Johnny O delivers regarding how he feels about his bud Gary that is my favorite scene in the movie. Johnny O tells Gary that he loves him just like everyone else, but he's accepted that the friendship is strictly dictated by Gary's wants and desires. He asks Gary, ""When was the last time you did something you didn't want to do? We never do anything I want to do."" Again, this is why I loved the movie. This on-screen friendship is real to me. It rings true.If you want a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan style romantic comedy....... than rent one. If you can stomach or Even worse if you feel you might be entertained by two people behaving very badly then perhaps you'd enjoy The Break Up.",The Break-Up

Guy and girl experiencing dating problems who live together ... Well the movie opens with their relationship on the rocks .. no reference to when times were good making it seem like things we never good between them. Ummm .. that gives the audience no reason to care when as their relationship crumbles. So all the nasty crap they do and say to each other as the couple tries to move on makes the audience feel awkward. Like you are seeing something you should not. The audience is really left saying ""BREAK UP ALREADY"" ... of course it takes a rising level of teenage antics for the two to break up and move out of their shared condo .. then they see each other on the street months later and everything is OK ... like they realized that they just weren't meant for each other .. maybe .. you also get the impression that maybe they wish they had done things differently .. maybe .. but like I said .. the movie never let us see the good times letting us believe that this relationship was never going to workNow my take on what the movie was supposed to convey .. That not all relationships work out however you can grow from them to become better people. The movie could have done a better job showing this ... hence my 2 rating",The Break-Up

The reason I bring that up is, after watching ""The Break-Up"" and after having been the only straight male in the US to sit through ""Down With Love"" and knowing that the only appeal of the moronic ""Bring It On"" was the sight of Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku in cheerleading outfits, I can't help but wonder, with thousands of film school graduates entering the job market every year, and thousands more hard-working, ambitious filmmakers pounding the pavement of Hollywood year in and year out, why does Peyton Reed continue to get hired to direct movies?",The Break-Up

I found the characters very believable (I have finally managed to squash the image of 'Rachel' out of my head!) and I thought Aniston and Vaughan acted out the demise of a long-term relationship very well and with a lot of emotion that actually rang true. The film displayed just how petty adults can be when they are hurting and trying to shield themselves and how heartbreaking the end of a relationship is. I thought the ending could be seen a mile off, however I was again very surprised. About 30 minutes from the end I thought it was obvious they were going to stay together and it would all be tied up in a typical, pretty Hollywood-happy-ending package. Amazingly, it didn't - but it was still very touching and most of all - very realistic. I liked this film.",The Break-Up

I'm not entirely sure the man can act, but even if he's just being himself, he's funny when he does it.Overall, The Break-Up was pretty good. Jennifer Aniston was solid, while the supporting cast added a lot to the film. One thing I noticed was that while it was a funny movie, I really felt uncomfortable watching these characters' lives fall apart around them. The film, and the actors, directors, etc. who made it, do a really good job of capturing the trauma that goes into a major, crippling break-up.I've had a few break-ups in my life, and I often found myself wincing during the most painful scenes.Personally, I don't feel this takes away from the film, and it may be that others don't feel this way.One thing I did like about the film was the end. Without giving to much away, it wasn't as Hollywood as I had expected, which was a relief.I don't think I'd give The Break-Up a must see, but it definitely rates a worth the while.

She kicks him off his bowling team and makes him walk out of the bowling alley 1/2 naked. Try reversing those roles! This movie clearly shows that women can be pure evil to a man and it's okay because she's a girl. Nonsense. She then has him attacked by her brother in his own home. He retaliates by not wanting to be in a relationship with her anymore. She responds by being meaner and meaner to him in an insane attempt to fix the relationship. Insanity!

The music was good, the characters real and the plot easy to follow. A perfect movie to pass the time as my Thanksgiving turkey was cooking in the oven. Jennifer Aniston brings back painful memories of that movie she did when she was pregnant living with a gay guy. That had to be the most tedious film ever created and should be shown non stop to the prisoners in Guantanomo Bay. I guess I would prefer a ""Rocky"" style ending in this movie where everything is right in the world but kudos to Vince and his team on this piece of work.

I have never really liked Vince Vaughn as an actor he's never jumped out and impressed me but I have been a Jen fan since the day ""rachel green"" was given life. She is a wonderful fun actress to watch. After seeing this movie today. I rather enjoyed Vaughn and this character and want to see more of him. It all was so believable. His job the families the fights the friends they really didn't want to break up but the relationship which started off on a bizarre note to begin with ran it's course. The writing needs a little work and the ending needs improving but the overall story was fun and laughable and enjoyable and not a waste of summer afternoon on my vacation. I do hope Jen and Vince are a real life couple they do have great chemistry not really with this storyline but the pictures in the beginning they looked like the perfect couple and better together than any pictures i've ever seen of Jen and that Pitt Guy!

But sadly that was not the case.Most of the funny parts of the movie were seen in the trailers. The rest of the movie consisted of the ""couple"" cursing each other out and basically just being jerks to each other. Good thing they weren't married...I went to see the Break-up with my wife on a Friday date. If I was by myself I would have walked out. I asked her if she wanted to leave but she wanted to see the whole movie.How bad was it? After seeing the Break-up and being totally depressed, we went to see RV (Robin Williams) to forget about the depressing Break-up.Now I've been married 20+ years (YES to the same woman!), and I have to ask myself ""what kind of person would like this totally depressing un-funny movie?"" Then I remember some other movies that I wouldn't darken the door of the theatre to see, yet lots of people go to see them. You know the ones I'm talking about: Halloween series, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, all the hacker/slasher types.These people must be the ones who think the Breakup is funny.So, if you are WARPED, then by all means go see it.

188,joerg-nezmeskal,More drama than comedy,8,22 September 2008,"Seen the movie yesterday on TV and have to say I liked it a lot. Even though you shouldn't expect a balls-out fun romp (better rent ""Old School"" if you're an Vince Vaughn-fan), this one is more of a drama with some funny touches that your average romantic comedy. I liked the premise a lot, which shies away from the typical ""boy meets girl, loose girl and try to catch her again-setup"", instead it deals pretty realistic with problems of miscommunication in a relationship. Both, Aniston and Vaughn play their parts very well and the supporting cast really shine in their roles, (it's always a pleasure watching the ""slackers"" Vaughn and Jon Favreau on screen). So don't watch this movie if you expect a nonstop slapstick-show but rather a good movie with brain, humor and a great heart, you can talk about with your mate after wards.",The Break-Up
189,JamesD2,Don't believe the negative reviews,7,5 June 2006,"This movie is very funny. Thus far, it is the funniest movie I have seen since 40 year old Virgin. The key here is the humour is very subtle in nature. My gf and I were laughing out loud at many parts the audience was silent in. The reasons why it was so funny is the character's dialogue was frighteningly close to my gf and mine's daily ""dialgoue."" The writers were very spot on. An example of what I am talking about is the scene which I saw in a preview somewhere when Jennifer says ""You should take out the garbage because you should WANT to"" and Vince counters with ""Who wants to take out the garbage?"" The audience gave only a few nervous chuckles in this exchange but I found it to be very funny as it was so spot on. My gf and I both agreed that it was the most accurate depiction of a couple's arguments ever recorded on the celluloid (or whatever they record things on these days).I think the vast majority of people will not ""get it"". But the screenwriters are geniuses and Vince and JA are both spot on. Very realistic portrayals, nothing overacted here.",The Break-Up
190,peterjb1,How can you possibly ENJOY this movie?,5,17 June 2006,"Right up-front I have to say that the two lead actors were extraordinarily good; the writing and directing were excellent; the credibility of the situation was high. The latter in particular is what spoiled the movie for me--it resembled too closely a couple of periods in my own life. This was not a romantic comedy--it was a movie filled with violence! ""Violence?"" I hear you say. Yes. The violence didn't involve gunshots or exploding cars--we've grown to accept them, in fact they now seem to be cartoonish--but it was vicious, verbal violence. I can obviously only speak for myself, but I came so close to walking out to the foyer halfway through the film--not because the movie was badly produced, but because I just couldn't take the up-close and in-your-face abuse any more. Yes, it's possible to make a good movie that I just have trouble watching.",The Break-Up
191,kpk_cioby,Someone please enlighten me maybe,2,27 June 2021,"I mean I do not get how this garbage of a movie is so ""high rated"" and they got a nomination for the best on-screen couple or whatnot.This is deplorable. I kept waiting for an hour and 20 minutes to see the guy change or even admit something's wrong. Now don't get me wrong, most romantic movies get me puking or rolling my eyes 10 times about how predictable it is. I hate the new wave of feminazi and I usually side with the guy who did one small thing while the woman can always do 100 bad things and it's somehow fine. I hate it. That being said, this movie can only have a happy ending and I don't think there will be one, if they break up and find someone more suited to them or at least someone that gives a damn and actually tries with her AND he finds someone who either doesn't care and they live in a cave or is good in bed and they do lots of that.In my personal opinion this is what's wrong with most couples nowadays, one side doesn't care at all and takes it all for granted. Secondly the writer is mentally disturbed and had a girlfriend like this and somehow he still thinks HE WAS RIGHT so he made a movie about it OR he's now alone and pathetic and made a movie romanticizing how things would've worked out if HE DID NOTHING DIFFERENT BUT THE WOMAN STILL ACCEPTED HIM AND TOOK HIM BACK (like so many couples nowadays do).Also I like the actor but his role and character, is just pathetic. It's so narcissistic and stupid that the writer of this movie thinks he's right and he's a ""catch"" and he's ""funny"" and also this really pissed me off, he's a GAMER. He's not a gamer and he's not a cool guy. Gamers aren't like this. The ""new wave"" of loser gamers that pick up ""gaming"" and play generic games all the time aren't gamers. Gaming is just more fun and better done nowadays so even the masses of people that can't even turn on a computer, are gaming nowadays.Anyway, if you are a ""cool"" ""funny"" guy with 2 friends, one of which likes your ex better, then this is the movie for you. This will make you feel better and call your ex bad for not doing all the work on her own while you changed nothing and took her for granted.I don't wanna keep ranting but ffs, we had ""romantic"" movies with SJP and she looks like a horse. And the guy bent over backwards and did everything to have her cause she was so SPECIAL. And in this movie with an actual cute actress and she tries to do the right thing ... I am pretty sure they will end up together even tho they are horrible and not meant for each other at all. That's not a spoiler, it's a romantic comedy ... DUH. Also haven't seen the end yet but doubt it will change my mind.",The Break-Up

193,dan_delago,Dark Romantic Comedy,5,7 June 2006,"If you're looking for a warm and fuzzy romantic comedy, rent Vince Vaughn in ""Wedding Crashers."" It's a brilliant romantic comedy. The movie company is marketing the ""Breakup"" as a romantic comedy but it's more of an anti-romantic comedy. I respect Vaughn for not wanting to be typecast but the marketing of this film is misleading.Why doesn't the film work? It's simple. The script is amateurish. Congratulations to these neophytes but let the audience beware. The characters are superficial. The gags are stereotypical. Since we don't really get to know who Vaughn and Aniston's characters really are. I mean, why did they get together in the first place? They are complete opposites. Vaughn is a video-gaming slob and Aniston is a sophisticated art dealer. Where's the connection? When they fight, which happens right after the opening credits. By the way, the opening credits are a montage of them having fun, I guess to make us feel like they have a solid relationship. Seeing them in Halloween costume pictures doesn't convince me that these two were meant for each other. Anyway, once they begin their verbal insults, it gets UGLY. I felt uncomfortable listening to their arguments.You get the feeling through the movie that they are more worried about their real estate investment than trying to salvage their sinking relationship. You just DON'T care if these two ever kiss and make up. There is simply no chemistry between them.Rule number one in romantic comedy writing 101. Make your characters interesting so the audience will care about them. This is no fault to Vaughn and Aniston who are two of the most talented actors in film today. I place the blame on the screenplay. It just didn't work for me. Romantic comedies depend on a good script because they are character-driven stories. This film runs out of gas right after the opening credits.",The Break-Up
194,KarisLOVER,Would have been amazing if it weren't for that stupid ending...,6,9 July 2006,"While this wasn't the excellent film I thought it would be, The Break Up is definitely worth a watch. It's worth seeing, if only to die laughing at Vince Vaughn. And amidst the sea of crap Hollywood has been sending out lately, The Break Up is a fun, and relaxing movie.The Break Up is about a treacherous villain who decides he's going to take over Kansas, using only 1986 Ford Mustangs. Wait. No, it's actually about, you guessed it, a break up (were the writers just too tired to think of a decent name?). Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn get upset with each other, and ruin what seemed to be a pretty hellish relationship. Needless to say, the garden variety story is not the reason to see this film.One of the reasons, would be the comedy in it. This movie was one of the funniest I've seen in a while. And I rank everything by the impossibly high standard of Arrested Development. Granted, it's not nearly that funny, but it did have me laughing very hard for most of the movie. Vince Vaughn is simply a riot. His delivery is pitch-perfect.Now, the premise of the story is not good by any stretch, but they throw us a twist that causes the entire movie to shift. I'm not spoiling it for everyone else, but know it's there. This twist, causes the movie to become about 14 shades darker, and much more interesting.The acting in The Break Up, is a very mixed bag. Let's start with the good: Vince Vaughn is great. His riotous energy is exactly what this film needed. He's loud, rude, but then takes a turn for the softer side. This could have felt forced, and insincere like most romantic comedies, but Vince pulls it off with ease. Jennifer Aniston, who I never thought could act, surprised me in this movie. At first, she is what I expected from her. Nagging, weak, victimized, you know she's Rachel. But then, coinciding with the dark twist, her character becomes surprisingly powerful. She paints a good picture of a woman who is changing. The supporting cast is, for the most part, terrible. And that's no ones fault, but the director's. Jason Bateman and Vincent D'nofreo are two of the most versatile actors I know, and yet the director insists on slapping stereotypes onto them.One last thing that needs to be mentioned, is the ending. There's about a five minute ending scene (not unlike an epilogue) that ruins a lot of the good energy the film had going for it. It's the epitome of everything I hate about Hollywood. They turn, what would have been an incredibly atmospheric and bleak ending, into a bs happy one. It knocked the film down three whole points for me. It's pitiful, and inexcusable.But overall, it's not enough to completely ruin the experience. Even after being livid about the ending, I realized, the jokes are still funny, the acting is still decent, and the movie is still better than 90 percent of what's out now. The Break Up could have been an A caliber film, but with the inclusion of the ending, turns out to be nothing more than a distraction.",The Break-Up
195,VideoJoeD,The Course: Relationships 101,5,20 October 2006,"This film, unlike many other romantic comedies, does not take you from the meeting of the male and female characters, through the falling in love stage, the courtship stage and concluding in the beginnings of a meaningful relationship. The film, true to its' title, jumps to the relationship stage early in the production and proceeds to explore how relationships can deteriorate if those involved lose enthusiasm for putting in the effort required to maintain the relationship based on the emotions which initially promoted it.Several IMDb viewers have commented on the true-to-life qualities of the film. I agree that there are many realistic elements and that this is one of the strengths of the presentation. There are a few other behavioral elements which could be questioned as to their true-to-life or normal aspects, but realism is in the eye of the beholder. What is real to one individual may be unusual to another viewer. This is one of the aspects which make viewing films entertaining and sometimes a little controversial. I like both of the stars, particularly Jennifer Aniston, and feel they were ideally suited for their roles.Viewers who prefer films with happy or upbeat endings, I sometimes fall into that category, may be a little disappointed with that particular aspect of this film. Viewers who prefer sad, or what they perceive to be more realistic, endings may also be somewhat disappointed with that element. Viewers should make their own determination on the merits of the films' conclusion, but I recommend that they do not let that deter them from viewing this film. Hopefully, couples about to enter into romantic relationships can learn a few things from the film, although it might be considered somewhat tilted towards one genders' perspective. I personally gave it a 6 out of 10 , but I could realistically see where IMDb ratings in the range of 2 through 9 could be assigned, based on the individual voters point of view.",The Break-Up

The game play is not something amazing or great, but the story is the story of almost every man on earth: the break up. What we wait is that the two guys will gather at the end and end of story. We will forget about this movie after 2 days, next romantic comedy please !!! And don't forget the happy ending!!! I felt something good 6 years ago, when I saw Mel Gibson's ""Brave Heart"". I was waiting for the hero to save his first love - in vain. But that was great! I was waiting for someone to save William Wallace until he's in the prison - in vain. And that was great. He has been tortured before been beheaded. And that was great - never mind the real disappointment i felt - someone could save the hero , he will take the queen and they will rule Scotland until the end of world. Dot. Nope that is great - showing the thing that they should be. Great work. I don't give 10 of 10 because I don't like Vince Vaughn, but anyways that is a good start with this kind of genres.

197,auntetr,Looking for Feel Good Romantic Comedy? WRONG MOVIE!,4,10 June 2006,"Once again, the marketing genies have struck again. Show only the funny stuff, and they will think it is a different movie! If you think this will be light and leave you feeling good, you'll be sorry. Love ya Jen, tolerate you Vince, it's not your acting...it's the story. Great shots of Chicago, condo to die for (on a limited budget? -it's ""Friends"" all over again!) solid acting by entire ensemble,(including the Mac guy from the ""Mac & PC"" commercials and ""Galaxy Quest"") -but flawed. The fighting scenes were really believable, but if you are doing a comedy, you can't make people uncomfortable by doing them as intensely as a straight drama. (The rule: ""Consequences are never as dire in comedy as in real life"".) Jen does some of the best crying she has ever done in her career, and we all know she is good at it, but here it was particularly heart-breaking. Wonder what she used for her emotional recall? (just kidding) The two most fatal flaws were: Vince Vaughn's character's supposed reason for being a selfish slob and the ending. HERE'S THE SPOILERS...We are supposed to believe he didn't lift a hand or do anything out of his way because, GASP! He could never let anybody inside that close? Gee, that must be what the problem was with my college roommate! He left me (expletive deleted) to clean up because he was ""GUARDED"" with his feelings. Flaw two: the tacked-on ending which must have come after the very first test screening. Sorry, anybody ever been in an EXPLOSIVE breakup? Ever had someone say ""Sorry, I just don't feel the same anymore."" after all the horrific fights? It's true that the opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy. The intensity of the fights is borne from the love in the relationship, but once you're done with it and all the turmoil, you're done. ESPECIALLY if you never let someone in and they toss it back in your lap, ""un-opened"" as in this story. Seeing them meeting a year later on the street to give us a glimmer of hope of them reuniting is believable if you have never been there. Sorry, it doesn't work that way. It does however, come off contrived. Tell you what, I will believe it, when Jen and Brad reunite. Unless, maybe they wanted us to believe that the reward would be them being: *REALLY GOOD FRIENDS* We kewl? Great. Now one last thing, why was Vincent Denofrio in this? Doesn't need the pay. Wasn't really utilized fully. Great actor, maybe he is from Chicago? I am not a Vince Vaugh fan, but if the remake ""The Honeymooners"" he will make a great Jackie Gleason.

198,rhhdvh,More tears than laughs,4,3 June 2006,"The movie was mis-advertised as a comedy, romance. Instead, it was a well acted tragic drama, with the opposite of romance, indifference. Vince had the classic character flaw of lack of commitment and surrender to his love. The couple had ""lived together"" for years - she wanted his love and submitted to him, worked the relationship; he was the classic ""What's in it for me type."" Totally self centered. Enjoyed the one way love. She demanded a real reciprocal love. When she did he bolted, into his dominant have to win mode. Great dramatic scenes. A heart jerker. No surprise ending to a move titled ""break-up."" Dishonest advertising and billing is the reason for the low rating. Could get acting awards.",The Break-Up
199,ehutson2001,"Not great, but better than I expected.",6,5 June 2006,"During the early days of ""Hee-Haw"", Archie Campbell delivered the unforgettable line: ""Confucious say, 'He who expects nothing, ain't gonna be disappointed.'"" That's the mindset I took with me when I went to see ""The Break-up"". Honestly, if I had had to pay full price to see the show, I would never have gone, but I had a pass which cost me next to nothing and had a couple of hours to kill - so, what the heck! Having said all of that, I was pleasantly surprised. Aniston's character was annoying - but that was the plan, I think. Honestly, I have a hard time watching her in anything. She never seems to play a role - you just see Jennifer Aniston - or your impression of her. Vince Vaughn's character was stereo-typical; but - once again - that was what was called for.The good thing about this movie was how a first-rate supporting cast and an unconventional story-line made it into something that it might not otherwise have been. I had not really seen anything that Joey Lauren Adams was in since ""Top of the Heap"" (the Married With Children spin off from 1991). She is a really big part of why this movie works. Her character is so believable. Jon Favreau always makes his characters work. Judy Davis and Ann-Margaret take interesting supporting characters and make them do what they're supposed to do. Vincent D'Onofrio does an unbelievable job playing a supporting role. After seeing him on L&O-CI, that was a surprise.Peyton Reed, I'm sure, is a very big reason for this one working. Even with great work from the supporting cast, other directors probably would not have been able to pull this one off.Bottom line, it's not a bad movie.

200,xolt,"Tedious, drawn out, not funny, lame, uninspiring.",2,25 June 2006,"Well well well, this film was simply atrocious. The worst film I have seen in the last two to three years.The breakup advertised as romantic comedy is anything but. I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was sitting through this movie.Nothing made me relate to the characters and their infantile behavior. They both came across as whining spoilt brats.The pace of the film is slow and pointless. Arguments, shouting and bickering don't make for light or romantic entertainment.Silly ""votes"" between good friends as to who is staying at the bowling game are just cringe factor, good grief do people really behave this way? certainly not my circle of friends. It was just embarrassing to watch.Not much redeeming in this film a few short laughs, one of the better ones being when their real estate agent friend offers to sell their home and wants to do so at no commission. BUT unfortunately company policy wont allow it so he has to charge it hahaha that was the funniest bit in the film.

I do not think that The humor just does the humor added do not go along with the body of the story. I am sure many female spectator would have love this movie if the purpose of Aniston point was developed throughout the story. She tried to change the sick relationship and recover in a not very wise way the magic between she and her boyfriend causing pain to herself and confusion to him. In the other hand, he just stayed without speak out what he felt after the breakup. They just loved to be in a struggling relationship, and never moved forward. The end was confusing, not quiet determined as happy or sad ending. According with the drama, I think there were many more options for the end. For instance, I would have loved to see if these two characters learned the lesson as an end. I wonder if any of the lessons as a couple taught them something that helped them become better persons... The message I sensed was about what happen when people divorce or breakup and have a common place to live.

But the whole first half of the film was deemed unenjoyable due to two obnoxious thirteen year olds sitting behind me and my girlfriend. They kept yelling things out the theater during quiet times of the film. At one point, they yelled ""Bob Sagat!"" during a serious part and killed the experience.So at first, I told them to be quiet. I said this calmly like a gentleman would.Time went by, and these two girls kept giggling and being obnoxious. Other people told them to be quiet, but they were farther away. I felt it was my duty to shut these girls up so the rest of the audience can watch in peace.This time, I said ""Shut the **** up, b****!!"" That shut them up, although I didn't appear very gentleman-like to my girlfriend.Time went by, and again these two obnoxious girls were at it again! So annoying, that I just said loudly for everyone to hear, ""Wow! Sounds like someone WANTS to get raped."" Heh, I didn't hear a peep out of them for the rest of the film. Which just happened to be the second half of it.Needless to say, it wasn't a bad movie. I just didn't have a good viewing experience. But what can I say about the movie? It wasn't as funny as Wedding Crashers. I didn't laugh as much as when I did for Dodgeball. This just seemed like a very average Vince Vaugh flick.I'm not saying this movie is bad, but its not great. Somehow, I expected more out of this because of how extremely funny Vince is in other films. It is apparently so, that Vince is the kind of actor who is extremely funny around other extremely funny people. I.E.: Will Farrel or Ben Stiller. He's okay alone. And Jennifer Aniston isn't the funniest 'friend'.So, I give it a very average 5 of 10.",The Break-Up
204,beries,Angry piece of drivel.,6,5 June 2006,"I did not experience any chemistry between Vaughn and Aniston in this movie. NONE. I think their whole ""real relationship"" being played out in the tabloids was really a build up to the premiere. I won't be a bit surprised when the National Enquirer suddenly reports of their ""real"" break up by July. Mark my words.Several things just don't ring true, but the most dishonest aspect of this movie is the known fact that Aniston's character never wants to end their relationship in spite of her exasperation with Vaughn. The writer of this screenplay so desperately has to keep her angry throughout the film, which after a while becomes ridiculous. The only true feelings that aren't a caricature is when Aniston is stood up, solidifying the fact that she is truly in love with the guy. Then when Vaughn finally ""gets it"" shortly thereafter, she's done. Huh?

But for some reason, I keep thinking that she does a good job in everything I've seen her do. So sad.This movie was one that I regarded with the same apprehension that I would a Ben Affleck or Sandra Bullock movie. And the only reason we rented it was because my fiancée is a big Vince Vaughn fan. Much to my surprise, the movie turned out to be quite good. But if you're expecting a comedy, then you might be disappointed. This movie is a drama. There is some humor, and most of it is pretty dark. But there's not even enough humor to call it a dark comedy. The thing that made this movie a winner for me is the fact that it accurately captures what goes wrong in relationships when both people really want it to work, but neither one has the courage to overcome their own fears and limitations... until it's too late. There are a few things that are a tad over-the-top, but never so far as to be truly unrealistic. I have myself done things that characters in this movie did, and I certainly have known people who behaved as badly or worse.The other reason that this movie is a winner is because it contains a valuable lesson about what not to do, AND what TO do. Vince Vaughn is the better performer in this film, but Jennifer Aniston doesn't do a bad job.",The Break-Up

From the trailers I thought it was going to be a dumb romantic comedy where I'd laugh at a few dumb scenes and a few dumb jokes. And I'd be happy.No. It was more drama than comedy. And two scenes were too creepy for me. The character played by Vince Vaughn in one scene is playing an Xbox-type game on-line with a 12 year old. A strange 12 year old. Note that Vince Vaughn is - what? - 35. Then in the next scene: the Vince Vaughn character is arranging a strip poker session with a bunch of hookers. The juxtaposition of the two scenes is not cool.

207,randy-377,An Unexpected Pleasure,8,8 November 2006,"I sighed when my partner brought this DVD home. Not another Jenny Aniston comedy...And look at the cast...must be funny. It begins funny. It only takes a moment in a relationship to suddenly find yourself asking, ""what am I here for?"" and the sad truth is, while pride and emotional distance is often the reason that people don't communicate, sometimes, as in this movie, they are simply not meant to be. Halfway through the film I said, ""they simply cannot get back together, they really don't like each other."" But I was suspecting a Hollywood ending, which happily, and sadly never happened. A movie in three movements, its a slow dirge revealing slowly the unhappy moments. Initially all their friends offer selfish, absurd advice, which gets taken for lack of any other navigation through the muddy emotional waters of any break-up. The epiphany comes in the form of a turnabout from one of the friends who reveals (a little conveniently) a truth about the main character. The tension arrives as it unclear whether they will get back together. It would be foolish to wish this, because they are clearly not meant for one another, and their characters need to, literally, grow up. And this is what is so rare. Most films of this genre would gladly turn their back on the the truth and find some minor chord moment where they kiss and make up. And this doesn't happen, which is rare, unexpected and totally adult. I appreciated Jennifer Aniston's depth of character. It was subtle, evolving and perhaps drawn from her own experiences with a certain relationship. It should be noted that Judy Davis almost steals the movie in her turn as a Devil Loves Prada modern art dealer. The sudden turns of advice from friends is my only fault to find in this film. If only life were that easy. But films are compact glimpses into larger situations and in this sad but true insight into the nature of a relationship, it has to be .",The Break-Up
208,abajoue,Not too bad...,6,25 June 2006,"While I won't be racing to buy the DVD when it comes out, it definitely was not a waste of my $10 to go see ""The Break Up"" at the movie theater. As movies go, it was pretty entertaining. Vince Vaughn was his usually comedic self as the schlumpy ""every-guy,"" and he and Jennifer Aniston had a good rapport on-screen. I stop short of calling it ""chemistry,"" because, while they played off each other very well on screen in terms of comedic timing, etc., there was none of that ""sizzle"" that one would normally expect in a movie about ex-lovers who're supposed to still love each other. That said, Aniston, Vaughn and the supporting cast provided more than enough laughs to entertain the audience throughout the movie. The ending of the movie could have been more satisfying, but endings to ""break up/make up"" movies are always difficult. If the leads get back together and live happily ever after, the movie is panned for being sappy. If they don't then the romantics criticize it. So while I personally was less-than-pleased with the ending of ""The Break Up,"" I understand that writing an ending for the movie was a difficult job that could just never please everybody. My verdict: between a B and B-minus, i.e., no Oscar-winner, but there are a lot worse ways to spend 2-hours at the movies.",The Break-Up
209,sparkster24,Unimaginative tripe!,5,3 August 2006,"I wasn't expecting much when I walked into this film. Both Jennifer Anniston and Vince Vaughn (in a serious relationship together in real life) are good when they work with the right people thus it was about whether the acting chemistry was right between the two. As actors, I don't feel either has performed to the exceptional standard they set themselves earlier in their acting careers. This was the main concern I had for this film.The beginning outlines the setting: Jennifer (Brooke) and Vince (Gary) begin a relationship together and eventually get married. Vince is an active joker and a lot of fun whereas Jennifer is more conservative and interested in aesthetics (specifically art). Both are successful and they eventually split up because Jennifer doesn't like Vince's ungrateful attitude.After the split, the narrative becomes a funny tale of how Vince and Jennifer try and irritate one another with their annoying little habits in order to get what they want. Vince provides the stereotypical 'masculine' point by simply gainsaying and competing against his wife for no other reason that 'phallic competition'. By contrast, Jennifer the stereotypical female, is doing everything she can to gain his attention and turn him into something he is not (i.e. someone who appreciates her). Put simply, Vince is a libertarian 'slobbish' male and Jennifer just wants to be recognised and appreciated.It is meant to be a comedy but I think the narrative is too serious to be a comedy. Unfortunately, inter alia, I have too much experience of this actually happening! Thus it is my belief that the directors were really up against it when they attempted to make a comedy out of something rather serious and too real. However, it was at times rather amusing (even if it was just typical American humour and, frankly, nothing funnier than you would find socially down the pub). I'd like to complement the advertisers at this point who did a wonderful job advertising this programme picking out the best bits of the film and making it look like an extravaganza when, in retrospect, it clearly wasn't. The film left me in a state of torpor! I'm not sure of its target audience either  I think it was aimed at everyone but, paradoxically, the narrative became too diverse to appeal to anyone.The ending also leaves a lot to be desired  it certainly is not what you expect. People go to a cinema expecting a genre to fulfil certain criteria. For example, if I go to see a horror I expect a lot of blood and a scary movie otherwise I feel particularly dissatisfied. This film certainly did not provide the type of ending you might otherwise expect thus not fulfilling the criteria and leaving a lot of romantic-genre-film fans very unhappy.Ultimately, this film never really captured the imagination and that's what really let this film down.",The Break-Up
210,snowpap,Terrible movie. One of the worst movies I've seen in years.,1,9 August 2006,"I love Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn is a great actor, plus Chicago as the backdrop was great; I love Chicago. However, this movie was absolutely terrible. I knew it would be before even going to see it as the previews looked awful. I went to see it in a super saver so at least I was only out a buck fifty. I highly recommend you all stay away from this movie. There was virtually nothing at all funny about any of the scenes and the only positive was that Jennifer, as always, was very, very hot. The only reason this movie got anyone to watch was the two main cast members. It you were to put in two unknown actors or even actors who were just fairly new, this movie would have flopped from the beginning. My rating - If it were possible, would be a total 0 out of 10. As it were I gave it the lowest rating possible at 1 out of 10. Save you money and stay home and DO NOT rent it, or go and see Ice Age 2 instead.

The ending to the movie made me so angry, I not only yelled at my friend seeing it with me but i stormed out of the theater in a rage!! Jon Favreau was the only good part of the movie. He never ceases to amaze me at the humor and light heartedness he can bring to a dismal movie. Vince Vaughn did have a few funny moments but mostly he was busy yelling at Jennifer Aniston who was OK, but this was no Friends like experience for any Aniston fan.

I salute the legendary actress Jennifer Aniston.She is the best.It seems that the age has no bar for good actors and she is one of them. I like the way she got irritated with Vince Vaughn and showing nice piece of emotional punches. she commands and over weighs other roles in the movie. This movie has seriously dealt with the compatibility chart of two room partner of apposite sex.This movie tries to portray that the tolerance and understanding is important in any relation and without which no relation sustains in long term.And people repents after wards this movie gives insight to day to day problem created for sake of ego,attitude and non co-operation on the part of each partner.

Not necessary more ""happy days"" of the couple, but more of their families, backgrounds, even some side-stories of their family members, their work? Now it's only shining vaguely in the background, showing that the writers might have thought this through a lot more than what shows in the finally movie.Also, for this movie, all the media about it before and around its release may have made more people go and watch it, but also, more people being disappointed. Your hopes were high when you sat down, and they weren't fulfilled.So, it might have got a higher rate from me if I hadn't been so disappointed, but had entered the movie with a ""clear mind"".

Although I did chuckle a few times, and the audience I watched it with did laugh at times, the movie is more of a drama. Actually it was the bad reviews that convinced me to see it. It is a painful movie watch, with long stretches of non-funny sequences.The reason I enjoyed it so much is that I have been in a situation or two like this, where it obvious the main characters care for each other, but the things they do to each other just leave you shaking your head. It's easy to observe from the outside, but love blinds you and when you are in this situation, things aren't as obvious. Also the supporting characters added to the enjoyment.Although I wasn't that fond of the ending, because this movie hit so close to home was why I liked it. It's worth seeing as long as you realize it's not really a comedy",The Break-Up
218,ValleyOfScarletFever,One of the Most Misleading and Depressing Movies Ever,5,1 August 2009,"Maybe I'm overreacting, but I found this movie to depress me for almost an hour. (Then I watched ""Good Luck Chuck"". That depressed me for another hour.) I was expecting a light-hearted, decent, funny romantic comedy. Instead I got a clichéd, self-pitying, story of a terrible breakup. The only saving graces were that it was somewhat realistic, and the ending was great in comparison to the rest of the movie.My problem with most romantic comedies in general is that they have this stupid set-up for reality as if everything is made of rainbows and butterflies and nothing ever goes wrong with the power of love. (That of course is not true.) Now, I'm going into this with missing the first half-an-hour, but I heard some of it and could tell it was depressing.Now, maybe it's because when my parents were married I remember them yelling violently at each other frequently and this movie hit too close to home, but generally speaking I just don't want to watch couples fighting. (And as brilliant as ""Revolutionary Road"" is supposed to be, I just don't want to suffer through that.) And guess what folks? That's all that happens in this movie. All they do is fight and argue and fight and argue a bit more and put their friends in difficult situations and cry and scream and personally, I just don't want to have to sit through that.Once again, we have another movie where everyone is a cliché. Men are all slobs, stupid, they all like video games and can't be serious about anything, and women are annoyingly persnickety and are hyper-clean and feel they are superior to their man. At least, that's what most movies tell me. Now, I know this movie wanted you to be on the woman's side (most romantic comedies do), but personally I couldn't stand both of them. He was annoying and slob-ish and although she didn't annoy me as much she was still a nagging stereotype of ""the every-woman"". Of course there was the pseudo-gay brother, the best friend who tells-it-like-it-is, and not to mention both lead characters come from two stereotypical families.One good thing about this movie is the acting. The acting, although at points slightly campy, is never over-the-top and never feels fake. You feel like you could believe they are a couple breaking up. Vaughn and Aniston work well together, and have some real emotional scenes. Another good thing about this movie is the ending; the ending is so real and honest to real life and open-ended that it just boosted an otherwise mediocre movie up another star for me. This is an example of a movie that is almost unbearable to watch but has a great ending.It's a terrible movie to bring a date to, though, because it'll just depress you. It's a good movie to watch when you're blue though, especially for the great and unexpectedly well acted ending.",The Break-Up

However, they were 'flogging a dead horse',I was entirely disappointed.I even gave the movie a second chance when it was on the TV a while ago,but it bored me even more than the first time.

I guess i'd have to say that the acting was spot-on,and that it's probably the first time I've actually seen either Vaughn or Anniston really ACT, but overall the film was a bleak hole.I was led to believe (by publicity?) that this was a rom-com, so that's what I told my daughters before we watched it (they're 17 and 8). How depressing to have two people on the big screen arguing just like mom and dad did last night in the kitchen.At first I thought it was funny, how the arguments were so similar to what a frustrated couple argues about (i.e. me and my husband) but then it got heavy. We watch films, for the most part, to escape, and this wasn't an escape but a slog through the mire of unhappiness.There were really no scenes that were funny, nor any that were even cute.

224,calinn_g,I'd rather watch the news than this,2,26 November 2009,"Everything seems unfinished in this movie. It's like they were pressured into making it in half the time it needed. It's kind of a romantic comedy, but with 50% of the comedy and 50% of the romance that a typical romantic comedy offers. Most of the romantic scenes are only half romantic and most of the comedy scenes are (you guessed it!) half hilarious. The story has no spark, we've seen it in thousands of movies. It's as innovative as a movie about a man who wakes up 10 minutes later than usual in the morning and he tries to get to work on time. Now imagine that if a movie on that subject would be made, that movie would end just before the guy gets to the building where he works. It would be even more disappointing... After getting bored for 1 hour and a half, you would at least expect something extraordinary to happen when he finally gets to his office (i don't know, something like shooting his boss or a tsunami destroying his work place), anything that would just make you say: ""okay, i got bored the whole movie, but at least the end was worth."" but that doesn't happen here. They just split-up and they meet after a couple of months and they say to each other how good they look. The End. I don't know... maybe the movie wasn't designed to be revealing, maybe it wasn't made to break the box office, but that kind of movie can at least entertain you with stupid but funny situations or with an ending that makes drop a tear. This doesn't happen here, when it ends you have the same feelings you would've had if you spent that 1,5 hour looking at a wall.",The Break-Up
225,Evac156,"Not a comedy; a tragedy, with a few comedic moments",3,27 July 2009,"I was very disappointed by this movie. All of the ads I had seen for it pitched it as a comedy centering around the fight for the apartment that neither character wanted to give up, and it looked quite funny. This was entirely false advertising. This movie is not in any way a comedy. It is a tragedy about a couple who are completely wrong for each other, but have realized it too late, after apparently fooling themselves, as well as their friends and families for years. It starts off light enough, but as soon as the actual break-up begins, it is nothing but sadness and pain. There is some comic relief, coming from supporting cast Jon Favreau, Justin Long, and John Michael Higgins, but Aniston's and Vaughn's characters are robbed of nearly any opportunity to do anything funny; they are too busy with the painful parts of their roles. Vaughn does get to do a few humorous bits: his reactions to Aniston's naked walk through the apartment, and his trash-talking as he hijacks of her date, are amusing, but for the most part he is just playing the part of a sad, immature man who is realizing he's wasted years of his life trying to be someone he isn't, for a woman who isn't who he thought she would be.Hardly ever funny, and not at all the ""date movie"" it's supposed to be.",The Break-Up
226,minimal-3,"""Break Up"" hopefully breaks up this genre of scripts she is accepting!",3,23 December 2006,"This is a tough one! I am viewing this film in December of 2006. I know it was released at least 3 or 4 months ago although with films in this category the distributor is pushing to get it to video release as soon as they possibly can because the video release is where much more money can be made and in this case video release will surpass domestic profits. However, you are not reading this to hear about how the distributor makes money... I watched as PPV on home cable after reading some reviews and taking in the marketing several months ago, and only because I like Jennifer Anniston and I was bored with X-Mass shopping and am not very familiar w/Vaughn.Anniston's film 'The Good Girl' is how I became hooked on her. I watched 'Friends' seldom but when I did, it was because I liked looking at her. 'The Good Girl' is J A at her best. Prior she was not pulling in audiences as one would think she would after Friends. Her previous films did not make money for the production companies to actually allow her to continue making films as a 'star' and I believe based solely on her performances on Friends was she cast in other films, all the while the producers would dump cash into her films hoping she would hit that one big starring lead to allow them to justify another J A starrer.""The Good Girl' was so good but yet made no more than her previous attempts in film work (I would imagine rentals put her over the top because rentals are rented mainly based on consumer 'word of mouth').I'm generalizing here and simply writing as I watched her career slowly fade (I.e.: I have completed no research on J A and her films but writing simply as a consumer watching what was going on with her career) until 'The Good Girl showed up on the radar screen of the possibility, the potential of a possibility for JA to find a niche for her considerable talent. I believe Good Girl was a big 'critical' success which will always make studio heads turn. 'The Good Girl' was so good and on a 'real life' level that if you have not seen this film do so now. You will be blown away by her subtle but deeply felt ability to sweep you away from your troubles for 90 minutes.Thus, based upon the GG showing blatantly her abilities for film work once a DECENT script is placed in front of her and her sheer talent we all know is there (why do you think H'wood keeps remaking and extending sequels...no freaking writing is going on out there.) she gets to make more of this genre' which is a shame because she is capable of much more than the horrid 'Break Up' and I am afraid she will be stuck in this type role. Certainly on one level she does not mind as I imagine she is paid very well as the women love her in this 'Break Up' sort of waste of film. Nevertheless, JA as a ""STAR"" right now and not an ""ACTRESS"" has to be frustrated not even mentioning her personal life.I have been wanting to get all the above thoughts down somewhere where someone MAY read them, although as you begin reading and notice this is not about this film specifically but about J A, you may skip over this 'review. I will tell you what I thought of 'Break Up', though: a true and real BORE. However, watching JA was a treat. The script was poorly written, the direction was bad, the casting was OK, and frankly, the supporting actors were more entertaining than the entire film taken as a whole. Generally, in most anything, you are usually only as good as those surrounding you and although JA tried, she could not carry the film herself and end up with an enjoyable product.My god when I think of that script and most of the dialog I want to cringe. Vaughn who was fun to watch as a fast-talking slob who tries, grabbed me more this time. Think about it, if someone meets over a hot dog at a baseball game and he essentially bullies JA as to what HE thought best, then you deserve what you get.I have been there, I deserved what I got, and it was not fun.This film made production budget wise at 150 mil (But when you see that figure multiply by 3 for what the film really cost in marketing and prints the production company (distributor) has to get to the screen and all the other costs involved.)Look at the video rentals of this film at what, 50 mil? it made a reported 350m worldwide but there are many more ancillary ways of picking up revenue domestically and foreign, so at 450mil they may have made a few dollars allowing JA to TRY AGAIN.Rent 'The Good Girl'. There is the real Jennifer Anniston. Moreover, I hope she can break out of the mold she has been cast in. Julia Roberts did it so can J A!!",The Break-Up

It's hard to associate with any of the main characters - the characters don't have depth, it's hard to like them, or hate them, or feel anything about them other than boredom or confusion. There are no feel-good moments. No suspension other than the everlasting question - when does the real movie start?

It isn't even remotely funny. It's in fact about as funny as paper cuts. It's the opposite of a romantic comedy - it's a sad little piece about a break-up, which has a stab at being funny here and there, but the overall effect is like telling gags at a funeral - they might be funny, but no-one's in the mood to laugh.Don't watch it and you'll have a better evening.",The Break-Up

I had heard from critics that there was no chemistry between the film's two main characters, but I realized half way through this thing that what was wrong with this movie went so above and beyond the lack of passion, or even attraction, between the couple breaking up. Not only is the Vaughn-Aniston chemistry nonexistent, there is no unifying plot, and scenes seem to have just been thrown into the mix for an extra dose of confusion. The mini-tangents in the film are random and underdeveloped--from Aniston's character's gay brother to a piece of wood on the wall Vaughn and Aniston are fighting over that is never explained. The comedy was also lacking. There were a few jokes, only two of which I can remember being remotely funny.And by the way--can somebody fetch Aniston a piece of cheese or maybe an olive? Sometimes the size of an actress fits the actress's body type (Salma Hayek, Ashley Judd, and Angelina Jolie are stunningly sexy and beautiful, for example), but the rail-thin look Aniston carries in the movie is bordering on hideous. At one point in the film, she turns sideways and you realize ""The camera adds ten pounds...is she even there at all?"" As for the Vaughniston relationship we are supposed to be getting a peek into...you wouldn't even think they were friends. There's a void that neither fills. Maybe the two love birds were saving their energy for an ""off-camera"" relationship--but then someone should have been shooting off screen instead.

I left tired, uncomfortable, and wanting my money back. All the funny moments are in the trailer...the rest is a front row seat to the worst in people.Though both Aniston and Vaughn perform well and convincingly, neither of their characters is likable. I couldn't find any great takeaway or message in the film.

I believe the jacket stated the following: Lighthearted, hilarious, laugh-a-minute, a good date movie...well, I don't know who put those comments on the box, but his sense of humour is sure not mine. It's not funny. It is a sad, sad movie about the end of a relationship. The relationship was fated to end right from the beginning, true, but still there were two people who cared for each other and who were hurting. Seeing someone hurting is not, in my mind, ""hilarious"".That said, it was a pretty good drama...I liked how the situation escalated from a stupid fight about lemons to an overall ""you don't care about me at all"" fight. I thought that was extremely realistic. Indeed, I think this is how many relationships end...months of bottled-up resentment waiting to come out. So the writing was good, and I thought the acting was good, and overall it was quite a good movie.But...I'm still only giving it three stars because when I picked it up I was looking for a light-hearted comedy.

233,thelockbox,"The movie was good, not the ending...",8,5 June 2006,"The ending didn't match what the characters did the whole movie. I don't want to say anything else along those lines and spoil it. However, although the movie didn't do a good enough job selling the films resolution, leaving you feeling cheated and unsatisfied, the rest of the movie is very good.It's an extremely funny film, and the main characters are perfectly developed. The first scene with John F. and Vince V. match, correspond perfectly with their scene towards the end with the serious conversation. The main characters you can relate to- particularly the couple and their arguments. Again it is very funny. Which I think is the part that is largely overlooked by a lot of critics, is how it worked as a comedy. The ending does leave a bad taste in your mouth.The moments, the emotion are all natural and you believe in and can relate to with exception to Aniston's decision in the end, which contrasts all she says and the way she behaves beforehand. An unconventional end is usually a good thing, but not in this movie.I think this movie has been poorly reviewed by critics across the nation, by that I mean, more than any other movie that I've read reviews on, I've never seen so many critics completely misjudge the movie. The pauses, and words not spoken, and the lost chances shown in movies with their beloved noted dramatic actors- they praise, but when Aniston and Vaughn, actors more noted for comedy do it, they largely panned it. Also the saying it's unbelievability they claim, is also wrong as they cite it for the wrong reasons or completely irrelevant stuff- like how nice the condo is (plus it seems they/particularly her, make a nice salary). A friend had an ending nearly duplicate to this movie happen to him in a relationship, the unbelievability is that Aniston's character before that shows no sign of going the path she eventually takes.",The Break-Up

Jason Bateman is the only actor that brings something a bit interesting or unexpected to his role, but he disappears into the one-dimensional background of the film along with all the other split-second characters.

It is a much needed twist to what has become somewhat of a cliché' in those type of films. Instead of witnessing blossoming of a new relationship you see the tail end of a plane crash. A very slow, painful crash. The story quickly jumps past the mushy fall-in-love storyline with a series of photos in a slide show to develop the back-story of this couples relationship. Then it immediately jumps right into the fighting, nagging, bickering, etc... It starts out with a simple argument that quickly boils over into saying lots of things you may not mean just out of anger. The rest of the movie focuses on the crumbling of the relationship. What makes this more interesting is the fact that they both share the same condo that they are dearly in love with. More so than with each other. Neither one is about to give this perfect pad up so easily. This creates a series of extremely funny and sometimes sad scenarios which are intended to drive the other person out of their home. The movie does a great job of displaying the communication breakdowns that commonly occur between men and women. A real Mars and Venus type approach. She talks to her girlfriends about the fights they have and the conversations are always completely different from what he hears and discusses with his guy friends at the bar. Very funny scenarios there. All in all you get to see this one through to the end and what becomes of these two peoples lives in the city of Chicago. I can't say I would recommend this as a date movie unless you half-heartedly want to approach it as an educational experience. A lesson in what not to do. A great movie that I would recommend watching.",The Break-Up
238,mandms-1,Amazing and Real Top-Notch Romantic Comedy,10,3 June 2006,"This movie is perfect for anyone, I went in expecting to a touching, hilarious movie, and I got exactly that. Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn bring a realistic sense to a relationship that O think will appeal to many people. This movie does not follow the clichés of Hollywood, and it is original. Jennifer and Vince have such a chemistry you are crying with them, laughing with them, and rooting for both even though you are torn between who to 'pick' or go with. I believe in life men and women think differently, and they brought this out amazingly in the film. This movie made me laugh so hard, and touched my heart because it is so true. Do not listen to the critics, or the bad reviews, go see this movie because it is worth the money.Loved it. I plan to see it again.",The Break-Up

I thought that they could be friends or talk about their lives, but instead, they walk away, and thats the end of their relationship and friendship. The movie's characters were static and didn't change throughout the movie. I believed that the movie didn't help or change anything from beginning to end. If I hadn't seen the movie, I would have believed the same thing. I don't like movies that don't change my point of view on anything. I like movies that have a central point or message. On the comedy side, the movie only had one funny line. This is when Jon Favreau talks about killing Vaughn's enemies.",The Break-Up
240,shel23,This movie is better than the reviewers rating,7,4 June 2006,"This is a comedic love story that has a ending that is far different from the run of the mill happy endings. Break Up tells the story of a relationship that ends and the ramifications of that ending in the life of the players. Jennifer Anniston and Vince Vaughn are by far not the greatest actors on the planet and neither makes movies of any real quality. However in this movie they act well off each other and play very believable parts with emotion and feelings. In a world where we look for happy endings this movie strays from the script and provides a real life ending that still leaves the audience wanting to see how there life's develop. We saw this movie in a theater that was packed on the opening day. he audience left the theater wanting to see more which only means that the story line was a success. Please disregard the negative professional reviews and the 21/2 star rating, this is a far better movie than that.",The Break-Up
241,TheMagpie,Good Dramedy,6,3 July 2006,"This is one of those movies that have been pigeon holed in the wrong slot. The makers are trying to sell it as a romantic comedy (which it definitely isn't) whereas it is a very good dramedy.Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston work great here as a couple who after one big fight call it quits. There remains two problems. First is that they still have feelings for each other. The second, both having gone shares in their condo, do not want to move out and let the other have it to themselves.Some of the comedy is painful, in a similar way to UK's The Office, in that it seems too real. There's no Hollywood overacting, and tips a hat to the 90's movie ""War of the Roses"".Judy Davis played a great comedic relief here, along with Jason Bateman. Good support from best friends of the couple Jon Faverau and Joey Lauren Adams.A good solid movie, keeping it real, without too much spectacular.",The Break-Up
242,mshires,"Hey, Peyton, we wanted the lemons. We needed the lemons.",8,14 June 2006,"*** CAUTION, SPOILERS *** So, ""The Break Up"" isn't scoring well here on IMDb. As of this moment the film has shot all the way up to a whopping 5.8, indicating a somewhat average movie going experience. And Mr. Ebert gave it two stars in his professional opinion, a movie he wouldn't recommend. I decided to see it anyway because I like the cast and I like Peyton Reed's previous work. I expected to see a by-the-numbers romantic comedy where Jennifer Aniston plays straight to Vince Vaughn's cutting one-liners. Wow, was I in for a shock.All romantic comedies are plagued by the same basic recipe: Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back  or some variation thereof. Many film makers have switched the order of these events so the basic story seems fresh. Alas, it is still the same formula.Along comes Peyton Reed with writers Jeremy Garelick, Jay Lavender, and Vince Vaughn with a movie that really is fresh, with compelling, believable characters  played expertly by every member of this cast  and it is lambasted for not being a romantic comedy! To be sure, there are many funny goings-on, but there is also surprising depth of story and character. From start to finish, every aspect of male/female relationships rings true; the bitter, the sweet, the bitter-sweet are all here. I was especially impressed with the see-saw of the principals' emotions toward each other -- out of sync, just as it is in real life, rather than dressed up with Hollywood's typical story luster that necessarily delivers the Happy Ending.There are a couple of things I really wanted in this movie I didn't get. 1) When Jennifer comes home, finds strippers in her living room performing, a single tear from her would have been nice  not essential, just a touching detail. 2) At the moment we know it really is over between them, when Vince has made dinner for two with flowers at the center of the table, there needed to be a bowl of 12 lemons either on the dinner table or for Jennifer to find in the kitchen after Vince leaves. Again, not essential, just a nice touching detail the audience was set up for, but did not get paid off with.Movie making is complicated. In Hollywood, film makers are surrounded by front office suits determined to dumb-down the finished product. Yet, here is a film that seems to have slipped through the H'wood cracks. ""The Break Up"" hits just about every note the way it is supposed to. I've given this film 8 out of 10 on IMDb, which for me makes it a four star movie, and one of the best films so far this year. Yeah, I know, I'm out on a limb saying stuff like that. But hey, y'all get a clue. The title of this film is ""The Break Up"". The film makers are not kidding.",The Break-Up
243,the_extremist,Painful,4,18 August 2006,"I can handle a good drama. But not when most of the movie is nothing but 2 people arguing and shouting at each other. And ESPECIALLY not when it is marketed as a comedy! Yet another movie to come out of the Hollywood meat processing factory, this story is (surprise) predictable and unoriginal; the dialog is weak and inane, but what really got to me is the shouting - it is completely energy-draining to watch and I left feeling almost sick. Everyone has had their fair share of breakups and/or fights, and there's no humor or joy value in watching a repeat of all your worst moments on the big screen.This I will give the movie though: It is a realistic portrayal of a breakup, the actors did a great job, and there are maybe 2 or 3 minor funny moments. But as a whole its nothing special or memorable and if you're planning to buy a movie ticket to ""get away"" from your dreary life for 90 minutes, then don't see this one.",The Break-Up
244,berno-08610,"Actors Hold This ""Break-Up"" Together",7,11 May 2017,"Yes, I am going to promote another critically panned yet publicly loved Vince Vaughn film simply because of one thing: it stars Vince Vaughn.Here's a guy men like because he's pleasingly crass and women like because he has a quasi sensitive side. If anything, Vince is the reason to go to the movies these days because he leaves political correctness out the door and endorses a touch of shame.In The Break-Up, Vince plays Gary who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Brooke, played by real-life lover, Jennifer Aniston. Neither one is willing to move out of the condo they share, so they both take the advice of their friends and instigate a battle of mind games in order to oust the other out. Little do they know that behind their trickery, they may also be trying to keep the relationship alive.Although Jennifer Aniston plays an agreeable representative of the female side, this is really Vince's film for the mere reason that when he is right, he is right, and when he is wrong, he is really wrong.Along with a likable, clumsy Vince, we also have an admirably funny cast including Brooke's ambiguously gay brother (John Michael Higgins of Best in Show), her eccentric art collecting boss (Judy Davis), and Johnny, Gary's best friend played by Jon Favreau in scenes that recapture the duo's chemistry in the 1996 hit, Swingers. To add, kudos go to Jennifer Aniston, who is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood as she constantly tries and succeeds to meld her old sitcom ""Friends"" character into something new.Overall, I was surprised by The Break-Up. I went into the theatre with all of the previously read criticism in my head but came out feeling refreshingly content. Some critics stabbed the film for being too funny, light, dramatic, and dark all at the same time. I ask, isn't that exactly what a break up is all about? Except for what I thought was a cop-out ending, Vince and Jennifer portray the finale of a couple as sincerely as they can. Seeing the film a few months after my own break up with my girlfriend, I could only relate, grimace, and smile.",The Break-Up
245,donatolla,Not the movie the studio wants you to think it is...,4,20 October 2006,"The Break-Up isn't the movie most would expect. If you were to believe trailers and TV spots, it looks like an entertaining romantic comedy. What you end up getting is an attempt at displaying a realistic relationship that fails miserably and ends up being terribly clichéd.Jennifer Aniston is the working girl that does everything. She's artistic and sensitive, but not sporting. She cooks, cleans, hosts dinner parties, and seemingly all of the other June Cleaver type things that would make her seem to be the perfect woman. Like any decent perfect woman, she just wants to be appreciated.Vince Vaughn is the guy's guy. He's funny, loves the Cubs, is a good bowler, and doesn't like to cook or clean at all. After a long day at the office (which is really the dream job where he gets to hang out and crack jokes all day) he likes to kick his feet up and play a little xbox. And like any guy's guy, he can't follow directions and manages to be a real ass.In order to make a movie about a break up, they had to put two people together who would have no business being together in the first place. As a result, they are the most extreme caricatures one could imagine representing people in a relationship. Its just hard to believe these characters would ever find themselves in this position.Then again, the trailers had everybody thinking this was a romantic comedy. It wasn't supposed to be realistic. It was supposed to give us some giggles. But it just wasn't funny. Instead, I spent the entire movie cringing as these polar opposites did battle. I've been in a room where a couple was fighting. That was awkward. This drew the same awkwardness out over a longer period of time.This could have been entertaining if it was funny. It could have been more heartbreaking if it was more realistic. It was neither.",The Break-Up
246,keifer-1,They had a real winner and blew it,5,4 July 2006,"Jennifer and Vince play lovers that share a condo.Like many couples, their differences balance each other out. She is more cultured and cares about social propriety and the finer things in life. He is still a kid at heart playing video games, but he is a good provider. She feels unappreciated by him. He feels unappreciated by her.He brings home three oranges instead of twelve for a dinner party centerpiece, they argue, and things start to spiral out of control from there.The arguments manage to be funny and at the same time uncomfortably close to reality. They seek advice from their friends, and, as in reality, the advice never quite works out like you expect it to. (The best one was the hunk that Jennifer brings home to make Vince jealous. He winds up becoming a video gaming buddy with Vince and is most concerned about whether or not he will hear from Vince again.)Jennifer realizes what she's doing isn't working and decides to make nice, so she buys concert tickets to Vince's favorite band. Vince stands her up.Vince realizes he has been a jerk and fixes Jennifer a nice dinner for two. Jennifer says she just doesn't care anymore.This is the exact point where the movie crashes and burns. Nobody in the audience bought that she didn't care, because we still cared. She had spent almost two hours banging her head against the wall and now that she's got exactly what she wanted, she doesn't want it anymore?You could almost hear someone in a script conference saying ""Oh, that happy ending crap has been done to death. It's not realistic, let's do something different."" Personally, when I want reality, I don't go to a movie.So be prepared to have your happy ending yanked right out from under you.If they'd gone for the happy ending, this movie would have worked.Even Mr. and Mrs. Smith got a happy ending, and they had been trying to kill each other!",The Break-Up

You know, like the kind of movie you'd like to take a date to.What I got was a movie that not only did not make me care for the characters, I wanted to see them both run over by the nearest bus.

At least it gives us some kind of satisfaction that it's no just us who ever go through such troublesome experience. But why, why would you want to see two people breaking up? Fighting? Yelling at one another? With no result whatsoever? It's too painful. If it wasn't for Jen and Vince, this movie would have never gotten on the screens.

249,doodygray,One of the worst films I've seen in a long time,2,18 January 2007,"Looking back on this film, I can think of very little positives. Usually in an otherwise dire film, there will be something to brighten it up - whether it be a superb performance that sticks out or a witty screenplay that never realises its full potential.However, in this film there is nothing to lift it above the mundane (Actually, I tell a lie. When the end credits started rolling I did feel a sense of elation. Vince Vaughn never goes outside his comfort zone while Aniston still struggles to create anything that vaguely resembles a character that isn't Rachel from 'Friends'. The result of this is a bafflingly bland performance.The screenplay feels laboured and uninspired while the direction is unimaginative. The intended twist in this 'rom-com' (although I use both terms lightly) is that the two protagonists aren't actually together. If built upon, this could provide a decent change from the usual stereotypes of the genre. However, it seems after this masterstroke the makers of the film simply ran out of any other ideas.I'm not the sort of person who dismisses any romantic comedy - I like to think that I always keep an open mind - but the comedy in this is dire while the one-dimensional portrayals of the two main characters offer very little romance. In fact, the basis for the vast majority of jokes in this film seems to centre around the fact that there aren't enough oranges in the centrepiece. Hilarious, I'm sure you'll agree. Unless you're an insomniac looking for a new cure, avoid this film. It's a complete waste of time.",The Break-Up

Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston put in solid performances in a film that feels strikingly real at times.The Break-up does not play out as a light-hearted comedy with a predictable wrap-up in the last five minutes. The Break-Up reveals the very human side of a failed relationship and its potential reconciliation. Yes, there are some very funny scenes. However, as the misalignment of expectations quickly unfolds the movie reveals its true self.The Break-up does a more than credible job of displaying many of the aspects of how people deal with conflict and remorse. Many of the situations play all-in-one as funny, sad and realistic.The bottom line is that the Break-Up is solid film built with Hollywood money and stars that chooses a route its benefactors rarely allow to be taken.

This movie was terrible, the acting was just O.K. for me, and the movie was not funny at all. It turned out to be just a romantic film about kicking someone out of your apartment. I found that this movie was just boring and tiring and it's one hour and a half I will never get back. If I had known that it was going to be this bad I never would of watched it in the first place. Even though the ending wasn't as predictable as I expected I still think it was stupid.

252,kjosm,This movie is better the second time around...,7,24 April 2007,"This is one of those movies that is just better the second time you watch it.The first time I saw this film was opening weekend in the theaters. From the previews I was expecting a typical Vince Vaughn film; a Dodge Ball or Old School type comedy about a break-up. However, a few minutes into the movie and you quickly realize the advertising was completely off the mark (and probably advertised it the way it did solely to get people to shell out $8 a ticket to come see it, not to be true to the movie). My husband and I found ourselves watching a movie that is not funny, horribly uncomfortable in certain areas, incredibly frustrating, and does NOT leave you with a typical happily ever after ending. Walking out you could hear the mumbling from the crowd and the consensus was clear: what was that? That was not the light hearted comedy we were made to believe we went to see. That was a drama, a drama I think that hits too close to home for many people and reminds them of things and fights they've had in their own lives.So it isn't too big of a surprise that I had yet to watch the movie a second time until last night. A girlfriend of mine is going through a break up with her own boyfriend so we decided to rent The Break-Up and drink wine as a kind of theme night. I found myself surprised at how much I liked the movie the next time around.The movie starts out with Vince Vaughn's character, Gary, and Jennifer Aniston's character, Brooke, meeting for the first time at a baseball game. She's there with another man and Gary doesn't care, happily pursuing her with his jokes and flattery. Then the opening credits catalogue the happy times of the couple with lots and lots of happy/funny/romantic pictures. Then we enter the real story, which is however many months or years later when the couple lives together and faces the same fights that a lot of people go through: he doesn't want to help clean or cook right after he gets home and she feels like all her work is taken for granted, he feels like she just needs to give him twenty minutes to unwind after work before he starts 'nagging' her.The interesting thing watching their fights the second time around is how true to life this movie is. I think that is very hard for people to watch. We go to movies to escape reality, not see it on the big screen in an uncomfortably real way. The biggest thing that struck me is miscommunication. Each one of them couldn't get their message across and so they just ended up yelling at each other, each of them feeling hurt and attacked and neither of them really understanding WHY things were so difficult for them in the first place. I thought it was also interesting to see how much our friends influence us when we are in these types of situations. Both Brooke and Gary wound up talking to their friends before making most of their decisions about the relationship and what to do next.After the couple breaks up, there is a lot of uncomfortable public fights that they have around their mutual friends. Then one of their friends, who also happens to be their realator, advises them to sell their apartment. Brooke secretly harbors a desire to get back together with Gary and starts to look for ways to get him to realize that he still wants her. She tries excluding him from their bowling team so he'll feel lonely, going on blind dates with other men to make him jealous, walking to the kitchen naked to make him see what he's missing... But all of this without coming right out and telling him that she didn't want to sell their condo and really just wanted him to show that he appreciated her and all the hard work she had put into their relationship. Gary tries as hard as he can to let Brooke see that he is not hurt or upset by her behavior, and after she leaves for one blind date (that she incidentally ditches as soon as she is out of sight of their Condo), he has his brother invite some girls over for a strip poker/dance night. They both do ugly things to hurt each other and underneath it all they still have feelings for one another...which is a sad fact of life. We all do things when we are hurt and angry that are hurtful to someone that we care about. (I am actually really proud of these two actors for making a movie dedicated to that part of people's lives, it was done very well.) The scene towards the end when Gary makes dinner for Brooke was very beautiful...and also very unexpected. It was so anti-Hollywood. It would have been easy to say happily ever after but they took the more complicated approach, which I think probably upset most people watching the movie. I hope if you sit down to watch it again that you can appreciate it MORE for its decision to do that, however. It is not always easy to make a movie that doesn't wrap everything up with a pretty bow at the end...The very last scene of the movie is my favorite. It leaves you with a feeling of hope that their could be more to this story, but not in the form of sequel or anything like that. But maybe, just maybe, this movie was just a glimpse at a bad time in the couples lives and you can let your imagination figure out what might happen to them next.",The Break-Up

Jennifer did good too, but Vince's performance surprised me the most. Without getting into spoilers, Vince played the egregious boyfriend very well (as usual) but he also played the serious side of the character well (that surprised me). Even though a joke would be predictable, Vince and the cast pulled it off well so as to make it very funny and seemingly original.

It had a few funny moments, although I was wholly uncomfortable with both the main characters. Gary (Vaughn) was annoying and selfish, Brook (Aniston) was a nag and didn't do much other than pose. The best thing I can say for this movie is that they did not hop into bed together and get together too quickly in the end.

The character is essentially another piece of Hollywood sexism, portraying woman as needy, manipulative and essentially unable to express their needs to the significant others in their lives, and Jen (as usual) didn't see it coming.The movie underlines the difference between Jen and Angelina so brutally. Angelina wouldn't have said 'yes' to this if she was starving to death. She would never play such a weak woman, and I think we can summarise that Brad just finds that more attractive than hanging about with the kind of woman who would.And Mr Vaughan, what are you playing at?

Anyone who has ever been in a relationship thats turned sour will watch this and definitely be able to relate to the characters (men to Vaughn and women to Anniston). The portrayal of male and female values and importance I found to be accurate and believable such as when Anniston has prepared a fancy meal for her family even though she has worked hard all day and Vaughn comes home and watches football rather than helping.

Jennifer Anniston lacked her usual spark. Vince Vaughn's performance was lackluster. One of my favorite actors, Jason Bateman, I hate to say it, sucked. One can only blame the director for taking such good actors and having them turn out such mediocre performances. The minor characters were not well developed, and even the major characters lacked a third dimension or like-ability. The script was also lacking.

Vince is a good actor and does the comedy roles well, I don't know if this will be one of his finest both from a viewers point and his own.Anyway i have a niece who wants it for Christmas, she's 13 and it will appeal to her more, I wouldn't recommend it and if you have a wet Sunday afternoon and nothing else to do then give it a go otherwise wait for it to come onto your local channel.",The Break-Up

I'll tell you why: Actors: I'm not usually a fan of Jennifer Aniston but I thought this was her best movie yet! I've gotta say, she made me laugh and in some parts cry and i've never really got that from her. Her character was a little annoying, but i think she acted quite well. However, Vince Vaughn, is one of my favourite actors and i was happy when he delivered one of his typical comedic performances really well. :) The supporting actors in this chic flic were average, i don't really have many thoughts about them as the film was mainly focused on the main couple. I loved the character Brooke's (aniston) brother in the film, i thought he was truly hilarious! Plot: The plot seems quite boring when someone describes it (i gotta say, it put me off a little when i read a short description about it) but it's not like that at all. It's quirky but realistic. I bet most couples can relate to some situations that happen in this movie, and laugh about it. Some couples may even learn a lesson from it.Script: Well written, many parts were funny. I maybe wanted a little bit more humour out of it, but that's just me being picky. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone but the beginning is a little better in my opinion, than the ending as i wasn't satisfied by how the story came together. This doesn't bother me though that much, like i said, i'm just being picky.Additional details: I loved the whole concept, like i said, and i like the scenery, costumes etc. Everything was above average.Overall, I enjoyed the film. I suggest couples watch it together or a group of friends watch it together. It's a feel good film i believe, and i certainly felt good after it.7/10 xox",The Break-Up
263,mariana_mjp,So much better than I remembered,9,19 February 2021,"I remembered watching this movie when it came out and liking it. Not sure why, being a 13 year old kid who had never been in a committed relationship (obviously). That memory is the one that pushed me to watch it tonight, 15 years older and with a lot more experience in life.I think this film is marvelous. I absolutely don't understand why it has a score of 5.9...maybe it's the realness and sour felling it leaves you with.This movies tells, in a very realistic way may I add, the struggles a relationship goes through and the stupid decisions people make trying to attempt to either stay in a relationship or move on past it. Vaughn and Aniston are amazing. They have great chemistry and they are one of the key elements in making this movie so good and real.The ending is my favorite part. Loved the fact that they didn't take de quick lane of fixing one hour and a half of conflicts in the last 5 minutes but actually allowed their characters to develop in the most natural way and, unexpectedly, show how a lot of real relationships end.9/10",The Break-Up
264,egoaltered,More likable than I expected,7,14 June 2006,"About halfway through this movie, I started to wonder why it has gotten such mediocre, even bad, reviews. I think perhaps it's because expectations of a one-laugh-after-another comedy are not fulfilled. The movie is heavier than I think people expect. It's bittersweet-- these two people obviously feel deeply about each other, but can't work out their problems-- and it's also a bit of a dark comedy, I think. I have to admit that it was a little exhausting watching the constant fighting. Vince Vaughn, while hysterically funny at times, came off as strident, yelling perhaps a bit too much. Where did all this anger come from? Jennifer Aniston, I thought, gave a great performance. She seemed relaxed and, while she didn't toss off the one-liners here-- she was more the straight man to Vaughn's funny guy-- she seemed more real to me, more human than I've seen her be in other movies. So while this movie is flawed perhaps, it definitely goes beyond the stereotypical romantic comedy. These are two people who we can at least relate to. Nothing completely unrealistic and over-the-top happens as in most romantic comedies. Over all, I was pleasantly surprised.",The Break-Up
265,jill_frombklyn,What a waste of D'Onofrio,5,28 May 2007,"Here is a movie that had cast two fantastic male actors (Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio) and didn't know what to do with them. I have long hoped to see such a pairing, since they do look like they could actually be brothers. But, it was not to be. This irked me throughout the movie --which I didn't care much for in the first place. But, my mind wanders at what a fantastic film it could have been had the conflict between the brothers been more pronounced and the whinny female conflict been given second place. I saw the movie more as a ""How women have to change a man for their own (the man's) good"" rather than a love story. You get what you see in a man. If you don't like what's there, go somewhere else. I found this to be a chick flick with the excuse being that the brother agreed.",The Break-Up
266,ironmaiden138,Just Depressing,3,28 May 2016,"Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman?? I'm in! Sounds like a blast, right? Well, I guess it would be, if the movie wasn't about a miserable breakup between Vaughn and Anniston's characters. This breakup takes place within the first 15 minutes of the film and since the two are stuck living together until their condo sells, it drags on for another 1.5 hours while we all watch. They fight constantly, try to make each other jealous and turn friends against one another. This might be funny or watchable if Anniston was unlikable. But, she is so sweet in this film and so heart-broken by her miscalculation that watching Vaughn be so crude to her just isn't enjoyable. This movie simply doesn't work. In the end, it may have had a chance to be saved by giving us an ending that we could feel good about. But, not the case. It ends on as crappy a moment as it starts with.I watch comedy to feel good, to lift my mood. This one does nothing but bring me down.",The Break-Up

270,Zekie,Great movie. Must see,8,11 July 2006,"The trailer of ""The Break-Up"" perceived this movie to be outrageously funny. I think the pre-conceived notions that this movie will be full of non-stop laughs given that both Vince and Jennifer are comedic actors. I find this movie absolutely excellent. The movie has many scenes where you will bust out laughing, especially considering the movie has Vince in it. The way he delivers his character to his one liners are absolutey fascinating. There are also scenes which will touch you or even make you cry. The ending is not what you expect and I actually seem to like the ending. Definitely not typical. What I do like the most about this movie that it's very realistic and it portrays relationships especially when it's on the bring of dissolution. It shows that relationships aren't always rose, there is a mix of gray and blue and the story, portrayed by excellent choices of actors, deliver the message perfectly.",The Break-Up

There were maybe 3 or 4 laughs, most of which were provided by the side characters. The rest of the movie consisted of the two main characters arguing and trying to do horrible things to each other. Additionally, the characters couldn't have been more stereotypical. Vince Vaughn played the typical sports and video game obsessed nincompoop that gives the male gender a bad name. Jennifer Aniston was the standard ""you don't appreciate me"" female lead whose sole purpose it seemed was to whine about trivial nonsense.

But it just didn't work because there was no where to go from where the movie starts. It just wasn't funny to watch two people fight. There were maybe three laughs, and the whole fighting throughout the movie took at any romance. So I guess it was an uncomedic unromantic movie.the acting from the leads was good but most of the side characters were over the top.the sub-plots didn't do anything to enhance the movie. without revealing it, I think the ending was poorly executed.",The Break-Up

With all the media hype about her real life marriage ending it kind of got in the way and made you wonder if she really acted like that when she's mad. We've never really ever seen that side of her, have we? It kind of left you thinking she actually could have some less than desirable, harsh personality characteristics. All of that mess (with her personal life) aside, I felt it was maybe too soon after things happened for her to put this movie out and there was too much hoopla about the incident to actually sit down and enjoy this for what it really was...just a movie. I liked the chemistry between the characters but it gets sort of dark and dismal towards the end and then perhaps attempts to try to correct itself with the ending, somewhat? STill can't help thinking this is a movie about the way Brad Pitt might have viewed Jennifer and she I'm sure deserves a better rap than that at this point in her career.",The Break-Up
274,SkyCAM,Story with no beginning and no end ...,4,3 October 2006,The trailer i saw looked promising. Having seen the movie now I am still confused what the point of the drama flick was. The acting is quite bad and the casting wasn't very clever either. There are the usual Hollywood stereotypes and we have Vince Vaughn & Jennifer Aniston in a supposed to be comedy drama. The introduction of the side kicks is a bit confusing if you ask me and everything seems to be thrown together. By the looks of it the whole relationship between the two lead characters breaks down in one single fight about some typical men / women issues. Since we only saw the couple meet each other at a Chicago Clubs major league game and some vague photo series I don't find the whole love thing very believing. One can't connect to the problems these two have and for some reason we get to see a 0815 drama with no happy ending although the two still seem to be in love with another. So where is the point? If you want to watch a enjoyable break-up go rent The War of the Roses. Don't even bother to watch the alternate ending its even worse than the original cinematic one...,The Break-Up

I love Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston both and really thought this movie would be great. Unfortunately, I felt so sorry for both characters in the movie and didn't really find much humor in the mean words and actions these two fling at each other throughout this movie. Even if the movie was intentionally not a yuck a minute, there is nothing at all redeeming about Vaughn's character that would make me want Aniston's character do anything but dump him and move on.

Although what they try to do to 1 up each other is good for some belly laughter.Jon Favreau's character as Vaughn's best friend is priceless as well.

277,DoctorScarlettJones,Chick Doesn't Like Flick,3,10 June 2006,"This movie was a disaster, which is terribly unfortunate for everyone involved.The only performance that was believable was Jennifer Aniston's and that was because she was channeling her actual real life break up with Mr. Bragalina Pitt-Jolie! Her performance was almost creepily real and sadly pathetic in most places because obviously she was venting her feelings from such a difficult time in her life.The rest of the actors were obviously confused as to what kind of movie they were in. Vince Vaugh, though I love the dear big lovable goofball, didn't mesh with his co star despite their supposed off screen romance. There was zero, and I mean zero, chemistry.The rest of the cast were wasted in this film. Vaughn's best bud, Jon Favreau had so little to do that it was an insult, same goes for Jason Bateman. The characters gave conflicting advice from one scene to the next and the whole thing seemed so pointless.What a shambles. Vaughn should let the real writers do the writing and just do the acting, because there is no shame in being a great actor in many genre's.In comparison to the film that Aniston's ex made with his new lady love, the Pitt/Jolie on screen chemistry was like fire!

I don't know anyone who has been in a serious relationship that wouldn't relate to this movie. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston are superb- they are both so credible and organic in these roles. Not sure about the bizarre-ish people the characters may surround themselves in the movie- family, friends and co-workers definitely are weird- but maybe they serve as a springboard to really bring the 2 main characters to life. (maybe comedic relief, too) In any case, so refreshing to watch a movie that is realistic and unpretentious. The opening scenes are scrapbook photos when the couple were together- they were wonderful- the exact types of photos most of us have in our own scrapbooks. It isn't an indie art-house film, but a big production that doesn't follow a relationship formulaic predictor for ratings, insead it portrays arguments and a break up in a realistic way. Lack of communication, lack of effort, too much pride, battles over what isn't so important but seems so at the time- all that. I was also pleased that it didn't wrap up in a big red bow at the end like most Hollywood movies.",The Break-Up
279,slovakWakko,What is it?,4,5 July 2006,"What was this movie about actually? Trying to make a skeleton of a messed-up relationship crisis? The movie wasn't too bad, Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn are decent actors, and it had some fun - in the first half of it. The second half... well, it changed from comedy to drama, and it went all downhill too fast for me. I've seen similar problems, I've lived through them, and what's in the movie is just a skeleton, which tries to squeeze into a couple of weeks, what usually takes at least a couple of months (or more likely a couple of years). In my opinion, Jennifer's character got burned-out too quickly, and Vince's got mature in even less likely time. In the end, it all seemed to me like if the writer of the script wanted to make a romantic comedy at first, and then in the middle of it decided that a happy end is too cheap - but was too lazy to rewrite the first half again. If they would concentrate more on one important event, or one specific aspect of the problem, it would be OK. But now it all looks kinda flat to me. The main features of the break-up process are OK, but between them is just empty space. I've seen a lot movies with only a fraction of the budget picturing the whole drama of the ego-contra-feelings fight much better, and I would guess that the movie was only about using Jennifer's looks and Vince's talent to make some money. It didn't touch me emotionally at all, and I am usually very emotional (and I have enough experience to bond with the characters).",The Break-Up
280,noxas,Review: The break up (2006),7,1 September 2006,This is a romantic comedy with a good romantic portal of a break up and also contains good but not great comedy moments. The relationship that breaks up is between a charming guy who takes his girlfriend for granted and a girl that wants more from the relationship then she is getting. Her plans to convince him how much he needs her backfire in a number of comical ways but results in them both understanding who they are and what they want from life.The relationship is realistic and it is believable that these people would be together and then go through a break up. The behavior of friends is where most of the comedy comes from and though enjoyable are not the main reasons to see this movie.This is a good film for couples happy with each other and their relationship to see but not suggested as a date movie. The truthfulness of the relationship could make uncomfortable viewing for couples not well established or who have their own list of grievances.,The Break-Up
281,ctgarrett,Not a convincing remake or maybe rehash ..watch About Last Night instead,3,2 June 2006,"Does anyone remember ""About Last Night"" with Rob Lowe and Demi Moore. Two people meet fall into a relationship and move in together. Then the couple has a fight and proceed to follow the advice of their friends instead of their hearts and winds up more deeply in love and understanding of one another but separated.Rob Lowe meets Demi Moore at a company softball game. Vince Vaughn meets Jennifer Aniston at a pro baseball game. They fight and break up and follow the advice of their friends. Rob Lowe listens to his buddy in the bar Jim Belushi (and at work). Vince listens to his buddy at the bar Jon Favreau, Vince has a brother giving him ill-advice at work. Demi Moore listens to Elizabeth Perkins. Jennifer listens to Joey Lauren Adams. Doing a nice comedic turn as usual.Neither are getting good advice and screw up the relationship badly, till it is almost unrepairable. This was like an extended episode of the TV show ""Men Behaving Badly"" mixed in with an episode of Oprah on proof that Men Don't Listen! STAY AWAY........STAY AWAY....... unless you think Jennifer got a nice tush and you want to see it.At least Rob Lowe and Demi Moore had on screen chemistry. You want to see them make it. I laughed at all the wrong moments in the Break Up.Rob Lowe and Demi Moore ride off into the sunset at the end of their movie. She rides her bike and he runs after her.****SPOILER ALERT**** At least the Break Up didn't cop out at the ending. They don't get back together. They run into each sometime later.

The showing I attended contained an audience that seemed to enjoy the fast-paced, witty dialog and laughed in all the right places (and did a collective cringe where appropriate.) What I saw on the screen was an honest and intimate view of a break-up from both the male and female perspective; the character growth portrayed in the time allotted was believable and incredibly well done. Male viewers were given the opportunity to see what fanciful (though sometimes convoluted) ideas a woman might have in rectifying her relationship and the female audience was given the opportunity to understand, a bit more, the basic, straightforward thought process of men.",The Break-Up
284,bwiers97,A more realistic look at relationships,8,16 October 2006,"This is not really a romantic comedy. If you are expecting something along the lines of Failure to Launch or even Wedding Crashers then you will be disappointed. Many people have criticized the movie because they don't really show anything from when Brooke (Aniston) and Gary (Vaughn)were a happy couple. But this movie is not about a relationship, it is about the break up. It shows the age old problem of the lazy man not putting any effort into a relationship, and it also shows how a person can sabotage a relationship by using mind games. I think it does these things in a pretty realistic way, there are no wacky hijinks involving monkeys or people getting shot in the butt. Aside from all that annoying plot stuff, this movie is really funny. Vince Vaughn is at his best in this movie, especially when he reunites with Jon Favreau for some of their funniest stuff since Swingers.",The Break-Up

The best about this movie is how good a job it does at dissecting the phases of a break-up on a psychological level. From the beginning, it hit straight on and touches the crucial points such as the actual cause of the break-up over a minor detail of everyday life (ex: who will do the washing up after dinner), but also the bad advise that they get from their friends and that they try to follow but makes them even unhappier.

With the tag line pick side I found myself unable to do so considering that Vaughn's character had the mental aptitude of a cave man, as the assault on my ears and eyes caused me to walk out of the movie in disgust halfway through, with the urge to wash my ears out with alcohol in a desperate attempt to cleanse my ears of Aniston and Vaughn's incessant bickering which made them seem like squabbling children rather then fully grown adults. The only thing that you can learn from this movie is to never bring a knife to a relationship gunfight and possibly the only reason why this movie ended up being made was to reassure all the women out there that their boyfriend is not as bad as Gary Grobowski.Previously I had adored Anistion in the work that she has done.

289,vjunkmailster,"Schizophrenic, daring, inconclusive, worth a look",5,24 October 2006,"The movie seems to suffer from schizophrenia. Tries to be a drama with comedic elements. Could've been good if it stuck to one or the other, or maybe blended the two in an artful way. But, that's not how it turned out. From the get-go, there's something lacking and it turns out to be the light-hearted, somewhat carefree atmosphere of a romantic comedy. The intro, which shows us the genesis of the relationship, suggests that we're entering Hollywoodland, where the rules of rom-coms apply. The rest of the movie doesn't so much cleverly subvert this notion as much as suffer from indecision in regards to whether it wants to be dramatic and maybe even poignant or light-hearted, witty, and bordering on being a sitcom.Still, I enjoyed it overall and I'm not quite sure why. I admired the cast and crew for taking risks and trying something new, something which audiences might not prove receptive to, and in hindsight, didn't.I almost sort of felt like the characters were almost aware of being in a romantic comedy, and were aware that the rules didn't apply anymore and desperately wanted to get back to fairy-tale rules where a mad dash to the airport can salvage everything, or a few choice words spoken to romantic tunes will heal all wounds.I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I won't say anymore. But, it tries something something new. The dynamics between Jen/Vince feels more real, more raw, and might hit too close to home for a lot of people. I'd rather Hollywood try something new and take some risks and fail.In the end, I think its redeemed by its sense of daring and not catering (fully) to expectations, even if the movie never quite pulls itself together.",The Break-Up

But this movie, is not anything like that. I realized that the movie is pretty realistic, given how it ends, and that it won't be just another romantic comedy. It's the life of many out there. I am a huge fan of the ending, since in real life, it always end up that way. Brooke and Gary may have been soul mates, but unfortunately, they realized that way too late. Gary was a pretty selfish realistic character, who only thought about him self, and in his mind, he had to always come up on top, no matter where, in a relationship, at work, and many other things, and Brooke was a selfless character, always giving into everybody's need, and never wanting anything more than respect. As Gary realized he was selfish, Brooke realized he needed more than a man to say what she needed to do or not, she needed to be herself, no matter who gets in the way, and unfortunately for Gary, he was on her way. I found the last dialog between them, where she tells him she doesn't know if she have anything left to give, amazing, because he had taken everything from her, her mind, her heart, her strength, and he was no good for her.LOVED IT.",The Break-Up

What is depicted here is an attempt to somehow glorify what for most can be a trying time in their lives, with a comedic twist.This movie fails on so many levels because the two characters meet, at all places, a Cubs game for starters. We see no apparent reason for the failure of their relationship other than he is an obnoxious, overbearing, lazy, self-absorbed and self-described ""Prima Donna"" who thinks he is entitled to everyone's full attention because he runs a successful tour guide business. She, on the other hand, puts up with his garbage long enough that after they buy an expensive, hip condo, she then decides she wants out.The films then tries, miserably, to put a comedic twist on a relationship that had no merit and had no business lasting as long as it did. They are both too weak emotionally yet the film tries to present them to the viewer as regular, stable people. It's true that many regular people have had break-ups that may slightly resemble this one, but does the film have to be so insulting as to suggest that breaking up with someone you're supposed to love be so degrading?

292,johnny_07652,One of the worst movies ever,2,30 October 2007,"Don't let my vote of 2 stars fool you, this is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It only gets a second star because it reunites Vaughn and Favreau who made the genius movie ""Swingers"" together, and their interaction in this movie is one of the very few redeeming aspects of the film.To be honest, the actors and actresses in this film mostly do a good job. What's horrible is the story, and the plot development. The movie meanders beyond what the title implies. ""The Break-up"" implies a couple who have a relationship which ends up being ""broken up"". This movie, however, is about a couple which has so shallow a relationship to begin with that there is not much to be broken up. And after the break-up of this fragile relationship which almost never existed, the film drags on and on. It should more appropriately be titled ""The annoying, unrealistically long, drawn-out fall-out of a break-up between two rather unsympathetic characters."" It was good to see Jennifer Aniston's naked derrière. It was good to see Vince Vaughn acting a bit like ""T"" and Jon Favreau acting a little like ""Mikey"" from ""Swingers"". It was good to see Vincent D'Onofrio playing the role of ""brother"" well. All these things were brief flashes amidst constant bickering, yelling, unrealistically out of control tempers flaring, and a plot that wanders like the Israelites in the wilderness.The end is stupid. They try to be anti-cliché, yet the movie is so trite and cliché throughout that instead of coming off as bold and daring, it comes off as horribly out of order. It looks like a mistake, and yet another failure in the plot development department. They break up, then she wants him, then he wants her but she doesn't want him, then they part, then they meet by chance, then they smile and compliment each other, then they part again, but then they glance back at each other and smile....I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!!! If you've ever had a friend who was in one of those stupid on-again, off-again relationships you know how maddening this situation can be. The first time s/he breaks up, you are there for your friend, a shoulder to cry on. The next time, you're there again. And the next time, and the next. Soon you realize your friend is a wing-nut and you're wasting your time by providing him/her with sympathy each time because they just keep doing it again and again and again. In the end, you don't care a whit what happens in that relationship. Well, this is EXACTLY the same experience, only crammed into a couple hours. It feels like an eternity of annoying hell, of dealing with petty idiotic people, and it eats up 2 hours of your life which you can't even sue HBO for to get some kind of re-compensation.If you have the urge to watch this movie, don't do it. Paint a wall in your home and watch it dry, it will be far more peaceful and far better use of your time.",The Break-Up
293,Alcarius,Very good and real movie,9,7 December 2009,"I gave it a 10 because its highly underrated here on IMDb and everywhere also. Jennifer and Vince make a great couple and while i can say being labled as romantic comedy is failure since there is no romance if we exclude the 2-3 photos from starting chronicles and him making dinner nearly at the end. There is a lot of fun stuff that will make you laugh if you got feelings on right place and understand that life is not work but joke. Vince is Vince and if you like his lines in Swingers and Old School you have to also like it here. The whole movie was something you can believe it can happen except a few minor details. While some may ask why the hell they cannot afford to go out and buy new place maybe think first and you can come up it is because there is no one selling them in middle of Chichago. The Strip Poker was a bit off the top maybe but still could happen. Maybe when he made that dinner could also be lemons in centerpiece. Nonetheless Jennifer acting was superb, really enjoyable, so you can see how some females may think and how they want from us men more appreciaton. While this was one of the first if not the only movie that actually made me feel sad for both of them. The only thing I could say about it is like ''SHOULD BE EXTENDED VERSION ON DVD with 45min extra movie for us who loved it'' and ''GIVE US SEQUEL PLEASE those who liked 1st movie would adore second probably''",The Break-Up
294,Born_Dead,The Break Up,1,3 June 2006,"There was a film many years back called The Stroy of Us starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfiffer in which a married couple was on the brink of divorce. The film displayed the formula in which a relationship is easily unglued by mistakes and outside interference (mostly family and friends adding their two cents). The Break Up is essentially the same film aside from the fact that Vaughn and Anniston are not married.Some of the biggest problems with this movie are that its advertised as a comedy but fails miserably. The theater was full of uncomfortable chuckles and forced laughter where genuine laughter came maybe one or twice. Another problem is the cast. Jon Faveru plays Vaughns buddy (no surprise there since they have featured in more then a few movies), Vincent D'Onofrio and Cole Hauser play unlikely siblings, then you have Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Bateman, Justin Long (Waiting), and Peter Billingsley (Elf, Christmas Story) whose celebrity and in some cases talent fall moot in this lacking script. Lastly the film feels incomplete when it abruptly ends and maybe thats giving it to much credit. It seemed to me and to other audience members that the writers of this film simply realized what a horrible mistake they have made penning this film and then just up and quit on it. To describe this film would be all to easy. It is as if a couple you have known long enough to be considered friends invited you to their home and then began to argue making everything uncomfortable and then you realize their is no door in the room in which to escape the akwardness of it all. Make that last a little over an hour and you have this film. This could quite possibly be up for the lamest film of the year.",The Break-Up

296,trax8,An overload of clichés,5,31 May 2006,"This movie would have been good if it wasn't so pathetic. After a brief introduction to a premise, the movie gets into full gear with a bunch of tried and tested (and by now irritating) onslaught of clichés. The ending turns out to be the now standard for all cliché movies, a complete twist or turn around. I mean you spend 70 mins of the movie watching something so predictable and in the very end you watch something that is a complete turnaround, which is illogical all so that some producer or director can say that the movie ""is not cliché"". It would have refreshing if this itself , ironically ,hadnt been turning into a cliché. Vaughn and Aniston do not share an on-screen chemistry and all they can achieve are bids to out do each other. As usual the trailer of the movie is very well done and gives the impression of a great movie but if all you wanted to see what was the best bits of the movie, just stick with the trailer. I would say this movie is recommended only for fans of Vaughn or Aniston who would rather get pleasure watching the actors rather the actual movie itself.",The Break-Up
297,sixdayssouth,Simply Fantastic,10,8 November 2006,"Honestly, I was completely shocked by this film. I didn't see it in theaters because it honestly didn't look like the type of film I would typically find appealing. But when the DVD was released, I snatched it up in a hurry because my wife loves romantic comedies. And that's exactly what we thought we were going to get. Instead we got a poignant, heartfelt and almost painfully realistic piece of insight into the psychology and calamity of two people struggling to hold onto something they never had ahold of in the first place: love.First of all, I must say that Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston were absolutely fantastic. I'm a huge fan of Vince's and I've enjoyed Jennifer in most of the films I've seen her in, but I've never appreciated either of them as much as I did in The Break-up. Their acting was directly on-target. The initial fight scene (when the break-up actually occurs) was so phenomenal I actually paused the movie when it was over just to take it all in. I've never seen two people on screen portray a 'lovers quarrel' so accurately and realistically. Hats off to Jen and Vince for an outstanding performance.The movie definitely has its funny moments. Vince brings his usual fast-talking wit to the screen and that's an instant recipe for comedy in my book. But what I really took from this movie, as someone who is in a committed relationship and understands (as well as the average person can) the complexities of love, was its underlying message. Love is not all moonlight and roses; it's not always romantic, it's not always fun and it's sure as hell not always easy. But hard work, dedication and a solid foundation of love and respect can bring two people through just about anything together. This movie is absolutely brilliant and I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially married couples or people in committed relationships.",The Break-Up
298,captain_scarlett,A Refreshing Twist On A Common Storyline,8,15 June 2006,"We have all seen movies of this ilk before: Cute cuddly couple head over heels in love suddenly hit a bump in the road and realize that their blissful happiness was merely a mirage. This is where The Break-Up separates itself from those all too familiar films.The ending of this movie is fantastic. It was not until later that night, that i realized my gob-smacked reaction at the time, was exactly what the producers had envisioned occurring among audience members.Too often in Hollywood we are treated to the usual fodder of boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy comes to his senses and gets girl back!!! This movie promised a similar scenario, and then just when we were all readying for the warm and fuzzy predictable ending, slapped us in the face with Aniston's sudden realization that she didn't want Vaughn after all!! The movie is littered with classic Vaughn one liners, but i was pleasantly surprised to see Aniston more than hold her own in the chuckle department. In my opinion the casting of John Favreau was a stroke of genius, with his abrupt unsympathetic humor a true treat for the audience.Not the greatest comedy of the year but definitely worth the price of admission!",The Break-Up
299,oleg_lenski,"Were they married, things could be different",7,20 May 2007,"The Break-Up was an enjoyable Saturday's evening watch. Aniston was astonishing as ever, with perfectly slim figure and emotional lines delivery. The plot was rather sad, with ordinary couple being broke because partners were not willing (at least immediately) to admit one's misdeeds. Were they married, things could turn another way, but it seems that married couple is something of a wonder in West now. I strongly recommend this movie for couples, because its message of being considerate and understanding of your partner at any time is very important. Although, it is said that the film lacks explicitly romantic theme.",The Break-Up
300,blueyedsunset,Wait...what?,6,2 June 2006,"I won't say this movie is terrible, but it definitely wasn't what I expected when I went to the box office. It's hard to see how exactly the papers are reporting this as a romantic comedy. A comedy it is, but I fail to see the romance. When I think of a romance movie I expect a good 'I can't live without you' thing to come up at the end. The Break Up doesn't offer this. Though Vince does an amazing job adding the needed humor, I felt empty afterwards. This movie is just to real, you expect it to turn around, but just like real life relationships often work out, you come up empty handed. When I walked out of the theatre I couldn't help but ask, what just happened? I can think of many ways that this film could have been improved, one of which being that there should be more depth to it. Some people may dispute but, honestly speaking, Jen doesn't offer the multi dimensional attitude we expect from her.This is a good movie if you don't get your hopes up. Thus keep your expectations low and you'll be impressed.",The Break-Up
301,actionromancefan,A somewhat funny yet unnerving film that accurately portrays a break up.,6,18 September 2006,"The title describes a lot about this film. It's not like your average romantic comedy, because both the romance and the comedy is different to the point that people who like romantic comedies might find it a bit difficult to like. But in some ways, this movie needs to be seen. Some of the jokes in there are so funny, that a few months after seeing this my father started laughing when we noticed the a giant bowl of lemons in the kitchen. If you are a person who recently experienced a break up, this movie is all too true and accurate. It will make you laugh a few times and notice the things you have in common with it. This isn't really an uplifting movie though, it's more like ""Oh, look at some of these clever uses of irony and how similar it is to my own life"". It's not really that well written, there's not any good goofy humor like you'll see in Wedding Crashers, and Jennifer Anniston is a terrible actress. She's cute, but she's just not the best actress in this film. Both of them come off as pretty dislike-able in this film in comparison to their other works, because the characters are pure stereotypes of the sexes. Jennifer is completely obsessive compulsive and Vince is very sloppy. And there's a lot of parts in this movie that are like ""Why are they in here, that's not funny, it's kind of depressing"". However, all in all, it's a movie worth seeing, if you bear in mind that it is an accurate portrayal of a break up. Break ups are usually only mildly funny and kind of depressing at the same time. Even so, for some odd reason, this is a fairly good film because it does make a few insights, but it still has far less goofy laughs in comparison to Vince's other works.",The Break-Up
302,toastyinva,Really Bad,1,4 June 2006,This movie is painful to watch - so NOT funny - 1 hour and 40 minutes of bickering. Too many arguments that don't lead to any laughs. People want Vince to say something funny and he rarely does so it becomes annoying to sit through the bickering. Terrible idea for a movie. Terrible script. Aniston continues her slide of less than mediocre movies. Why was Ann-Margret in this movie? She did nothing. How many times do we need to see the video game Vince is playing?? Who cares?? This movie should take a huge hit at the box office after word gets out that this is the movie to avoid this summer. I would not even rent this garbage. You have been warned.,The Break-Up
303,Mylo_Milk,Good for what it is,7,15 June 2006,"For a Hollywood romantic comedy, this is fairly good quality. Good performances, lots of laughs, and an extra mark for the unusual subject matter (I'd like to give it 6.5). This is the universal sequel to every bulls**t coupling to hit the screen which in real life would be guaranteed to end in tears - the plausibility is appreciated. Funnily enough, it made me want to go through a break-up - feel a bit like I'm missing out on a key life experience. As corny as it is, it sort of felt like the message was 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger', and that some horrible experiences just have to be endured and all will be well in the end. I don't suppose all break-ups could end (eventually) on such amicable terms though, especially not where infidelity is involved, but it's nice to think that it doesn't have to result in bitter feelings.",The Break-Up
304,kaleidoscopeeyes8,Not worth your time.,2,21 June 2006,"Overall, this movie was a waste of my time, which is rather hard for me to say because I am usually a big Vince Vaughn fan. His movies are usually quite hilarious, but this one was really lacking.The previews made it look like it would be very entertaining and I had heard in reviews that Aniston and Vaughn played quite well off of each other, so I was anxious to see it. However, I sat there at the end of the movie very bored and felt as though I had wasted the last 2-3 hours of my life.This is nothing against their acting abilities, the plot and script were crap for them to work with. As the previous reviewer said, there was just a lot of fighting, and not enough humor. I expected way more from Vince Vaughn. I might now be hesitant to see any more of his movies, lest I spend those hours as bored as I was while watching this film.",The Break-Up
305,mgordon69,The Breakup of a good idea,2,25 June 2006,"The basic premise of this film could have been vehicle for a thousand gags and one liners. However, this film tries to take itself a little too seriously for being touted as a comedy. There is some funny shtick buried in this film, but it is spread way too thin to be called a comedy. It does have a chance to redeem itself in the romantic category right up to the end, but literally turns its back on what the audience is expecting - No happy ending. As a result it turns a great premise into a dark comedy and reflects a sad slice of life. Instead of a dark successful comedy like 'War of the Roses', we end up with a film that falls flat. My guess is that the director tried to please everyone with this film instead of following his vision of what the film should be. The resulting film will end up doing poorly even as a DVD rental.",The Break-Up

Granted Vince and Jenifer aren't Brangelina but this is not the same kind of movie as MR. and Mrs. Smith so it should not be compared.Gary and Brooke are the all American couple who's lives were perfect and then suddenly after an argument their lives changed drastically.They try to sabotage each other in a fight to keep their condo while the real fight was for them to keep each other. This movie portrays a common theory of how so many people who are together don't appreciate each other till it's to late. This wasn't really a comedy but Vince is always hilarious. To me this was a drama and the only thing I hated about it was the ending. I want to know if they got back together!!!,The Break-Up
308,dblouin,The Real Break-Up,8,27 February 2007,"I think some of the commentaries so far have missed the point. The real break-up didn't happen at the fight the night of the dinner party. Gary broke the last thread standing Brooke up at the Old '97s concert. It took finally seeing her devastation to begin to understand how much she had invested in the relationship, and then have his epiphany-at any other point it would have been enough, but at that point it was too late. The real break-up was when he reached out to her and she had nothing left in her to return his affection. She is no innocent either, but she owns and admits that. Her fault was in not seeing his immaturity as his blind spot and thinking if she just did this or that, he would come around and change. It wasn't just their relationship; it was his attitude toward everyone, his passive insistence that he do what he wants and everyone else comes along for the ride (interesting given his profession), which Jon Favreau's character finally has the cojones to confront Gary on. I think this movie got panned mainly because it hits so close to home. The truth hurts. You don't know what you have until you lose it, and it usually doesn't come back to you-at least not in the way you had it before. Gary needed this break-up because it made him a better person, more considerate of others, more committed to personal improvement and growth. Brooke needed it because she needed to see that she could do everything 'right' and it still wouldn't change Gary, or anyone else. And the proof that this was necessary to both of them is the final scene, where there is true good will and delight at seeing each other looking well and happy and at peace with the direction their separate lives were going.",The Break-Up
309,andlaw99,Funny? No. Romantic? No. Well-made? No. Realistic? Sort of. Disappointing? A BIG YES!!,2,19 June 2006,"Well, everyone seems to be concentrating on the fact that this was advertised as a romantic comedy and it is neither romantic, nor a comedy. That is definitely true.Aside from that, however, it is a poorly-made movie. The timing is off (comic and otherwise), the editing is off pace, and the writing is clunky. I've read a lot of user comments that mention the fantastic ""depth of character"". Let me just say that having characters that act like immature jerks instead of typical movie star characters does not automatically qualify as character developmentit's just different and new, not real ""character development"". There are many characters that we get to know a little and are left with NO wrap-up for. The main characters are the only ones we get closure for, but even they are not people we really care about by the end of the movie. I felt when we left the theater that Aniston and Vaughn had so little chemistry it's hard to believe they developed a romance off the set.The biggest problem is consistency. If you're going to make Vaughn's character a beyond believable inconsiderate jerk, this same character would not make a 180 degree turn around after a short erudite ""pep talk"" from his bartender friend. By the same token, if you're going to make Aniston's character the kind of person who would put up with this behavior for so long, she would NOT in real life totally change her mind about him a few days after sobbing in her bedroom about their relationship when he finally makes the list of changes she wants (minus the bowl of lemons and ballet tickets he should have had on that table with the dinner).As an aside, I know that I am probably the only one who feels this way, but the language was much rougher than I was expecting. If you go to see Lethal Weapon 18, you expect F's and GD's galore, but it really took me by surprise in a romantic comedy, especially since there are so many GD's in the first 15 minutes of the movie. I just mention it for the record.All in all, I would pay another $15 just to have that two hours of my life back. And while we're at it, I am really sick of the marketing geniuses advertising movies in such a way that you have no idea what you're walking into. It makes the viewer give it even worse word-of-mouth than they would have otherwise. You can bet I've already written an email to all my friends telling them what a huge disappointment this movie was and to avoid it.To sum up: Sloppy execution, poor characters, inconsistent follow-through, and a really crappy ending. Save this one for DVD and even then, wait for it to be taken off the ""new releases"" wall so you don't have to pay as much for it, or better yet, maybe you'll get lucky and your library will carry it and you will be able to pay NOTHING for it which is basically what it's worth.",The Break-Up

Jennifer Anniston seems hell bent on making us think she can act when all she does is play Rachel from ""Friends"" and Vince Vaughn somehow manages to get work by having horrible delivery, abysmal comedic timing and pretty much the same ""frat boy featureless"" look on his face in every scene.

I would have run as far as possible as fast as possible but apparently there was something about this slightly deranged tourist guide who likes to play video games that appealed to her. Well, so, my dear you deserve every bit you're going to get. Vince Vaughn has all the ""funny' lines and she is like a farcical woman from yesteryear, dating other guys to make him jealous. I'm not kidding, that's what she does, while he goes to visit Jon Favreau - the best bits in the film - to cry his miseries to the one other character more moronic than himself. Glimpses of Judy Davis, Ann-Margret and Vincent D'Onofrio give the movie an unexpected lift but, dear me, dear me. Rush to see the films of Preston Sturges, I'm talking to the filmmakers naturally.

I've found myself having these feelings and being less able to communicate them than these two characters were, and I would imagine the person on the other end feels the same. Sure, strip poker may be a bit of artistic license, but many folks revert to the juvenile behavior when unable to address something they are afraid of. I found many of the scenes very moving, and was glad to see the film not spin into a bunch of goofy BS when it came down to brass tacks.

Yeah you could stay home and have a fight with someone, but you learn something when you watch someone else fighting. Both my fiancé and I thought the fight scenes and the looks that they gave each other were realistic, especially the last scene of the movie - the look in their eyes. They picked some great men to play in the film and the splashes of humor were great. It was also nice to have an ending that was different from a lot of the typical endings.

At many points the movie dragged and the jokes got repetitive (how many times can Richard, who is Brooke(Anistons) brother, be poked at because he is a man who sings?) Vaughn I am starting to believe plays the same role in every movie he is in (Wedding Crashers, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Break-Up, Starsky&Hutch, etc.) Aniston, in my opinion, should stick to TV, we all loved her as Rachel.

I was expecting to see a very overdone movie where a perfect couple get into some monumental argument or disagreement that causes them to breakup, but then eventually come to terms with their mistakes and movie ends happily with the couple back together. The Breakup is definitely not this type of movie.The Breakup is about a couple who seems perfect for each other, but find themselves growing apart. Throughout the movie they refuse to believe they could possibly be at fault for the demise of the relationship as happens with many couples. Throughout there battles of breakup Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston throw a healthy dose of comedy in. They have a very believable on-screen chemistry they rally makes this movie work.Although the comedy is great, this is not the main reason I liked the movie. The best part about this movie is that almost any couple can relate to the difficulties they encounter in their relationship.

317,terulian_maveric,"A disappointment all around, but I expected that",3,23 June 2006,"Over a 2-day span, I went to go see this, and The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. There was a 2-3 vote for Tokyo Drift over this movie, and in this case the majority was right. The storyline was overly cliché'd, and had far too many big coincidences. The acting, which some say was great, I found horrible. As usual, I found Vaughn and Aniston playing their usual characters. Aniston reminded me of ""Bruce Almighty"" and Vaughn reminded me horribly of my least favorite scenes of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"". The saving grace of this film was Vincent D'Onofrio, a superb actor, who pulled off his role extraordinarily well.As for the plot... it's pretty much the title. But as for billing it as a comedy... It was funny, at points, and I'll admit that as a comedian, Vaughn shines, where some funny moments got me to look back at the screen, but the overall flow of the movie was lacking, and a good plot wouldn't need funny jokes to get my attention back. The ending actually surprised me, however, because it was not your typical romantic comedy ending. However, seeing as I wouldn't classify this as a ""comedy"" for most intents and purposes, that makes sense.All in all, the mostly sub-par acting and the yawn-worthy script left much to be desired by this over-hyped summer film.",The Break-Up

AND I saw this in the theater, which automatically heightens my own personal enjoyment of movies. So I think it says something that I was not too impressed with this one.Vaughn is blessed with superb comedic timing, as well as Aniston, but the script itself was tedious. Vaughn's monologue's which I so enjoyed in ""Old School"" and ""Wedding Crashers"" is way too much and frankly annoying after the first half hour.

320,miss-jewel,Painful,4,5 September 2009,"The film is about a couple breaking up (as you might have imagined) and it really is about that, a girlfriend and boyfriend that after time together declare break-up war to each other. The war consists of insulting each others family members, to not turning up at appointments and organizing wakeup songs from a hated group of choirboys or orgies in the sitting room and situations that should entice the others jealousy but never seem to work out. Often situations swing from realistic fights and awkward, ridiculous situations all done with bitter-sweet irony. It is a bad film to watch if you're going through a painful break up or have just been through one because the realistic element in it is much stronger than the comic one so if you're thinking of going to watch this to exorcise the pains of breaking up it might not quite work out, if not then judge for yourself but i didn't enjoy it as much as i thought I would.

321,tvlover1961,Not such a horrible film,6,8 March 2007,"First of all, I want to say that the acting in this movie is really good by all characters, central and supporting. This is a very well cast movie, no misses at all.Having said that, I am glad I did not pay to see this movie in the theater. This movie was promoted as a romantic comedy and a good date movie. In my mind, it was not a romantic comedy--really a relationship drama with some comedic elements. As far as being a date movie, I would hope that you have been dating your chosen one for awhile, otherwise this movie could be a bit of a downer.I thought the best part was played by Jon Favreau--he plays Gary's friend who owns or works in a bar. He is somewhat of a bartender/psychoanalyst and provides the most comic relief--not rolling on the floor funny, but fairly clever humor. Gary's brothers were also amusing in their own way. I do not mean this to be insulting, but all three show the more yucky side of men that women do not see for the most part (references to genitalia, getting laid, ear cleaning--you know, guy stuff). Vince Vaughn plays the part of Gary very very well--this may be the best role I've seen him in. He clearly revealed a man who is deeply hurt, but has a nonchalant attitude about it until the end, when of course it's too late.Jennifer Aniston did an excellent job of portraying Brooke, a woman who is perhaps seeking a fantasy of a man. The scene after the concert that Gary agreed to attend, but then ""forgot"" where she is literally sobbing in her bedroom is one of the most heartbreaking I've seen, maybe because we've all been there at least once in our lives. At the beginning of the breakup, Brooke wants someone who basically can pick up her clues about what she wants. This is a problem between men and women I think--as women, we send out clues and hints whereas, our male partners more often than not need us to just tell them what we want directly.I think this movie did cover a breakup very well, but very quickly--and that most people would not be so stubborn that they would insist on continuing to live in the same house. Both characters were a bit immature in their expectations and attitudes, but seem to come around by the end.Some people hated the ending of this movie--I thought it was great! These are two people who have forgiven each other, can remain amicable and maybe can pick up where they left off someday or maybe not. We don't know and this is a part of what makes the movie work--you can talk about it afterward and make up a whole future for Brooke and Gary.I gave this a 6 only because of the absolutely HORRIBLE misrepresentation by whoever promoted this movie. If you want a romantic comedy, see something like ""You Got Mail"" or ""Must Love Dogs."" But for a decent study of a relationship on a downward spiral, this is pretty darn good.",The Break-Up

If you your an are critic let me rephrase, What do you think normal people would expect?For it to be funny, right? It doesn't have to be none stop funny but you should be able to remember that its funny over all right?This movie isn't funny, Period!You want to know what it is? Its a CHICK FLICK minus a happy ending and any possible likability.I feel like i should tell you more but realistically you've seen this story before if you ever seen a chick-flick or ""romantic comedy"". Only with 2 major differences.1. Its not f*king funny 2. The guy and girl stay broken up, with no happy endingright so bottom line, ITS NOT A COMEDY AT ALL. its a TRAGEDY!, comedies start you down and bring you up with joy.

324,gracefulfailure,"The Break-Up is broken, but it could have been fixed",5,3 June 2006,"All in all, The Break Up was rather disappointing.The comedy, at times, is genuine, but most of the characters aren't fleshed out well (the realtor, for instance--his name, occupation, etc. aren't revealed until his part in the plot is crucial, and the brother, who is slow, but no explanation is given to why he's in charge of the financial records, etc.), some of the acting was over-the-top (Judy Davis, I'm looking at you. You weren't funny, you were awkward.), and there were times where 20 minutes would pass without a laugh.I disagree with the whole 'don't even see the relationship as a success' thing. The opening credits sequence is good enough, so they can jump right into the plot.Aniston was mediocre, Jon Favreau was laughable (stay behind the camera, dude, that whole scene near the end was just painful to watch), and Bateman was underused.It was also a rather ugly film. They should have taken a look at The Weather Man for tips on how to shoot Chicago. Too much focus on the size of the city, when the movie itself is rather person-centered.Bad dialogue, bad dialogue, augh the bad dialogue. Especially from Aniston's mouth.I must admit that some parts worked--mainly Vince Vaughn, who almost saved the film. The guy's naturally charming and funny, he works well, and his performance seemed mostly effortless.The Old 97's were good, even though the director decided to use their recordings as opposed to their actual performance.The ending, on the other hand....notsogood... *SPOILER ALERT* it's the new Hollywood standard--the ""unexpected expected"" ending. We know they're not getting back together, it's what we expect nowadays--we've become bored with everything working out, but now we're becoming bored with everything not working out. It's a conundrum, to say the least. Maybe movies should just end with a big title card that says ""Insert Happy/Sad Ending Here,"" or it should just be a complete non-sequitur, who knows. *END SPOILERS*My conclusion: Mediocre script bad cinematography bad acting (with exceptions) painfully long/unfunny scenes needed more heart, more comedy who. are. these. people? secondary characters as plot devices.5-6/10",The Break-Up

The main problem is that the two main characters played by Vaughn and Aniston are completely unlikeable. The tagline is ""Pick a Side."" Who cares about either of these people, they both are A-holes. SPOILER ALERT! The cause of their break up doesn't make sense. We're just supposed to assume that this has been going on for a while? They don't even have a real fight. It's basically: help me with the dishes. No. Okay, we're over. The film doesn't even clearly establish that they are broken up. The audience must assume. And the arguments they have feel so forced, which is a sign of bad writing more than bad acting. The entire movie feels forced because they never establish a good enough reason why we should care about these people and why they are broken up.",The Break-Up
326,ndrewno,Critics in Denial : Tabloid Influence and the Great Comedy,10,23 June 2006,"A close friend once said, ""With Vince Vaughn, you can't go wrong."" I wanted to believe that, and then ""Starsky and Hutch"" was released, followed by ""Dodgeball"". I was still rooting for Vaughn, but not his films.""Break-Up"" is the beginning to starting over. This is true when it comes to Vince Vaughn as a comedic/serious actor, ""Break-Up""'s place in film history and the story's deeper meaning.It's easy to say ""great script"", ""great acting"", ""great directing"", ""great production"" when defending a film, but it's another to understand what these comments mean. Vince Vaughn, and all of those involved in ""Break-Up"", understand greatness (all the way down to the titler hyphenating Break and Up).Many critics are presently in denial of being influenced by tabloids and uninteresting headlines (Vaughniston*, Bradgolenia*) and are panning this film to prove they are uninfluenced. This needs to be addressed more than the similarity between the title and what happened to Jennifer Aniston.To tear this film apart, and attempt to justify those ignorant below-the-belt attacks by comparing it to ""Old School""'s lack of depth, or mentioning over and over the ""alternate-ending"" as a copout and not an artistic ending with the same moral, is beyond the normal ignorance of the film critics (probably due to the excessive amount of them). It's Vaughnistignorance - the most hypocritical stand I've ever seen critics take.Go into it open-mindedly. If you think it becomes a bit serious, fine. That's a matter of opinion. I personally thought that was what set the movie apart from ""Wedding Crashers"" (another well-written comedy, a rarity). If you don't enjoy the ride, or maybe where it leaves you, complain to someone. You have that right. Although, if you call it ""sophmoric"", or if you can't muster up a concrete reason for bashing it, don't. It doesn't deserve it. It deserves its recognition for being a comedy and a film. Many people like to say how great a film is and state it as a fact. I enjoy 10 to 20 movies a year that I'd recommend. That's it. Being a novelist/filmmaker, and keeping those forms of productivity close to my heart, justifies my premises and opinion on this film.* (Vaughniston and Bradgolena may be misspelled. These are compliments of my wife and the media which swallows her.)(P.S. Go rent Jon Favreau's ""Zathura"" and see how kid movies should be made.)",The Break-Up
327,jrtrotter,A poor movie that guys will have to suffer through,3,5 June 2006,"Guys! You will probably be dragged into this movie, if you have not been already. The good news is that it is not that bad. This movie is funny in spots, and not man-bashing to the point that it will make your date wish to change her sexual orientation. One guarantee though, if you are in an established relationship, within 24 hours after seeing this film your significant other will say to you; ""I really identified with ___________."" Fill in the blank with one of Gary's, and presumably your, faults. If this is a first date, beware! This movie will ruin the mood for the rest of the evening.Here is why this movie fails.The basic problem with this movie is that we do not know why these two became a couple in the first place. We see their first meeting, then a montage of photographs to establish that they are a couple, and then the fateful evening when everything falls apart. A casual examination of the Brooke and Gary would lead anyone with an ounce of common sense to conclude that they do not belong together in the first place. Since the film fails to give us any information to the contrary, we must conclude that the break-up is inevitable and, in fact, a good thing. Without character development, we have no investment in the characters. So, we don't care that they have broken up, and have no interest in their getting back together.Another problem with this film is that it is slightly one-sided, favoring (big surprise here) the female character. While both Gary and Brooke engage in infantile stunts that are intended to bring the other to their senses (fails) and make the audience laugh (fails again) , it is Gary that has the problems  there is really nothing wrong with Brooke, or so the film would have us believe. In fact, by the end of the film, Gary has grown while Brooke enters into a somewhat self-indulgent lifestyle. This lack of equality damages the ending.Finally, the supporting characters do not support, they distract. Most of the humor comes from the supporting cast. That's fine, but they are supposed to help us understand the main characters. Instead, these people are so messed up that their problems become as significant as Gary and Brooke's. Since the supporting cast is large, their problems cannot be explored in detail.The bottom line is  not that funny, but less painful than a root canal. As my wife put it; ""We just spent two hours watching a couple fight. We could have stayed home, seen the same thing, and saved the cost of two movie tickets."" By the way, she was very disappointed with the ending and lost all sympathy for the Brooke character at that point. My reading of the other women in the theater was that they felt the same as my wife.Since I played it safe and indicated that the above may contain a spoiler, here it is: At the end, Gary realizes that he is a self-centered slob. He fixes it and tells Brooke that he sorry, and that he wants her back. She realizes that she does not share his feelings and goes off on a world tour. They meet again on the street after about a year. Here is how it went; ""You look great, I hear that you are doing well, have to get going."" As they walk away, they glance back, smile, and then keep walking. Roll credits.",The Break-Up

It makes them both come off as twits.Also the way this story is told is fast forward.Little snippets and get right into it.The story seems to start in the beginning with the climax or the main idea of the movie.Is this something new Hollywood is doing now? The characters are not even shown how they develop into a relationship.It is not believable that there isn't even an attempt by either one of them to try to manage their relationship. That also is a problem with writing in Hollywood. If you are going to tell a story, then tell a story. One wonders if this is going to be the way films are structured in the future.

But, no, this isn't How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and it isn't an extended Friends episode. It's a movie about people with real problems both in and out of their relationship. Watching this may not sound like a very appealing way to spend 2 hrs., but add in the fact that it's expertly cast, well-paced, and an ultimately satisfying story with some truly funny moments and what you have is something that is inarguably a good movie.If your main complaint about this is that it isn't as fun or ""funny"" as you thought it would be, you have a legitimate complaint against the film's producers.

This movie may not have a big twist or conflict. It also doesn't have complicated storyline. This movie actually is pretty simple. It tells a story of a couple who is on a though times of their relationship. How that problem could take them somewhere they never thought before. And how by overcoming it, they found something else inside them that is actually the answer of all their problems. You will see a lot of yelling scenes, but also heartbreaking and heartfelt moments. And the best part is that you could totally relate to these characters, or to the story. You will realize that this is actually very realistic, these moments in the movie could actually happen in real lives. Such a beautiful balance.I must say that i have no doubt on vince and jen's acting. Clever comedians who are also able to nail the serious moments too. You will laugh on their jokes, you will smile when the romantic scene comes, and you will cry when the sad moment comes (seriously i cried so much on the last 30mins). Very well acted.This may not be the best romcom movie of all time, but the break-up sure is worth to watch. Especially if you want to see one of the most realistic story of romcoms.",The Break-Up

Jennifer Aniston does a fantastic job playing a very realistic woman in a relationship with someone she fell in love with, but really shouldn't be in a relationship with in the first place. She battles between letting go and, as many people do, holding on because its a known quantity and there are some good memories. Vince Vaughn's character is a child in a man's body. He is charming and there's a reason why Aniston's character fell in love with him. But in the end, he's a self-centered emotionally-unintelligent man unable to see rationally or beyond his own self-interests. I was annoyed at times when Jennifer's character wouldn't let go and move on. She is so out of Vince's character's league. But, it actually happens a lot in real life. The end is surprising and relieving. Loved it.",The Break-Up

Loved the script, the humour and the dynamics between the characters. Its also a nice relaxing film to watch, one of my favourite 'chick flicks' ever.

Shyeah, riiiggght! If I want to see a poignant relationship flick I don't expect the comedic talent that was in this film or the film to be advertised as a comedy. There are a few chuckle moments but over all the character interplay came off as more mean-spirited and vicious than funny. Vince plays the spoiled, self-centered man-child that some women think they can change and Jennifer is the woman that starts playing mind games to ""save"" the relationship as well as talking to, taking advice and listening to everyone but her significant other. I wish I could recommend anything about this but even the supporting cast (some of my favorites) only seem to float in and out for the occasionally break in the warfare.

I was actually thinking that this is one of those films that I am going to be sat there hoping that it would end soon. How wrong can you be? I have to say that I really enjoyed it. Vince Vaughn played the comedy role so well that at times I was almost in tears with laughter and the serious parts were played with equal conviction. Jennifer Aniston was very convincing as the female side of the break-up and although I am not a fan of hers (I think she will always be Rachel from Friends in all the films she does) I was impressed by the way she took on the role. The way the film was made was the real clincher, it put both the guy's and the girl's points of view over extremely well so that there was no bias. Guys that watch will relate to Vince's role and girls will relate to Jennifer's role and it is all put together in a way that it could well have been a true story. My favourite part must be the clips of Vince playing Grand Theft Auto which brought a nudge in the ribs from my girlfriend and a 'that's you that is' comment and I must give a big round of applause to Johnny O as Vince's best friend for the scene in the bar when they were discussing hit men.",The Break-Up
335,jclive,Breaking Up Can be So Cruel,10,4 June 2006,"I love Vince Vaughn - from the moment I caught him and Favreau in swingers ! He can do a lot - from the funny The Wedding Crashers to the offbeat redo Psycho and Clay Pigeons. But I've always enjoyed him for his words. Vaughn and Favreau are what Affleck & Damon strive to be but come up short.This is a RELATIONSHIP movie that anyone can relate to, more so if you have actually been in a relationship where you care about the other but it is just not meant to be.I like how we quickly catch their first meeting, see a photo show that captures that they have built a relationship, then BAM, we are immediately thrust into their lives today. While the supporting characters are not developed at all, that was fine with me. The focus was on the break up - what two people do when the relationship isn't working but they don't have the courage to move on.Aniston seems the perfect pick for Brooke. She can do the comedy, let us feel her anger without going over the top, and she never seems to come across as the ""I'm so pretty I can't imagine why the guy doesn't care about me"" kind of broad.I did laugh till I cried a few times - maybe that's because I've had breakups where I wish I had had the courage to do some of the things these two characters do.

336,j_mancinone,Sharp & funny,8,18 October 2006,"This is one of the best comedies I've seen this year. After all the negative things I heard about this movie, I was sure I would hate it, so it was a surprise to find myself laughing hysterically throughout the entire thing. ""The Break Up"" is an anti-romantic comedy. There's even a ""When Harry Met Sally..."" Pictionary moment, with a slightly different punchline (""It's a sock, a**hole""). Vaughn & Aniston's delivery of dialogue is so sharp, and they are able to pull off being mean to each other without losing the audience's sympathy. Ultimately, they are two people who have grown apart and don't know how to talk to each other any more. I thought this film was realistic in many ways, and it was a special treat to see characters in a comedy who actually grow and change.While Vince & Jen obviously carry the movie, the supporting cast is unbelievable. Seeing Cole Hauser as Vaughn's slimeball brother in a bar, I realized this movie is something of a sequel to ""Swingers"", in terms of seeing what those characters might be like ten years later (""You've just got to separate the weak ones from the herd""). Judy Davis, Justin Long, and Jon Favreau are all great (and so is Peter Billingsley, little Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story""!!), but NOTHING compares to John Michael Higgins as Aniston's a cappella-singing brother. He steals every scene he's in, and participates in what may be the funniest fight scene since the glow-in-the-dark condom/light saber duel in ""Skin Deep"". You **must** watch the second half of the alternate ending, and the mini-doc about his a cappella group in the special features.Finally (and this is the spoiler, if you can call it that), the title of this movie is ""The Break Up"", people, not ""Getting Back Together"". While the ending surprised me, I really liked it. It maintained the integrity of the story, and prevented the film from turning into clichéd BS, as happens to most ""romantic comedies"". In a way, it reminded me of films like ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", which were unusual in that they were large-scale commercial films that didn't have typical happy endings at the expense of their stories.You have to see it and judge for yourself, but in my opinion, you won't be disappointed.

Jennifer Aniston was on target in a role that hearkened back to her character in Office Space. Vince Vaughn was quick witted and sharp in a believable format that was miles above where he had acted previous. ---Look for Ralphie from The Christmas Story in the bowling scene.

The trailers portray it to be a hilarious movie but it was true life, and true life sometimes is not funny or usually isn't funny. The ending i liked, it had a ending that seemed to flow with the whole movie and did not seem fake and out of place. What made the movie somewhat bad is that they made it seem like a great comedy movie, but it was not a comedy at all, i think that maybe the people who go to see this movie with the idea that you will laugh till u drop will not get what you bargained for. If you love easy comedy this is not the movie for you. I like Jennifer Aniston but she was not funny funny in this movie, she does have some laugh to yourself scenes but they were brief.

You don't come to completely like either main character, but I think that is the point. They both have fatal flaws, and can't really change... maybe a little too close to reality for most people. It is in turns, funny sad and bittersweet.I suspect most of John Michael Higgins very funny character wound up on the cutting room floor. He had a small but hilarious role and disappeared. It seems like he always leaves us wanting more.Vincent D'Onofrio is as usual the weakest actor in this cast. Type cast yet again in his vaguely autistic, may go postal at any minute, character.

The acting was credible, the minor characters creative and interesting, and the direction was competent. But to bill this in any way as a romantic comedy is downright unethical. People arguing and trying to top each other with hurtful behavior is neither romantic nor funny. True, there were a few very funny moments with some of the minor characters, but these were not enough to salvage the film.

I guess my expectations were low but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie.I wonder if critics and viewers didn't like it because they thought it was going to be another slap-stick comedy (that Hollywood churns out and we've grown accustomed to being insulted with)? I liked the movie precisely because it was different and not what you would expect from a romantic comedy.I thought Vince Vaughn's acting was excellent and was really surprised at his talent for playing serious scenes. Jennifer Aniston as always did a great job.A criticism I would have of the movie is that they didn't build up enough background for the two main characters. Almost from the start we're presented with Aniston's character picking a fight over what seems to be trivial issues but obviously go much deeper. But without the background it appears that he's just an easy-going guy getting picked on and she's too much of a nag.It isn't until almost at the end of the movie that you learn what their problems really are and the point Aniston's character was trying to get across in the original argument.Contrary to what a lot of others on this board are saying, I highly recommend it.",The Break-Up

347,fischman-4,"Wow, was this bad",1,5 December 2006,"The term 'story arc' does not apply to this movie. If it was a poignant tale of a breakup, it would not have had some fairly shallow comedic relief sprinkled throughout, along with very poor character development. Instead, what you get is a relatively flat story about two people who don't really go anywhere from the start until the end. There is a minor and shallow attempt at evolving the characters, but it felt as if these were emergency tack-ons intended to save the film. Aniston and Vaughn are though clearly good actors, and some of the supporting cast potentially had good roles to play and fill out the details. What instead happened were continual scenes of discomfort but not strong supporting character, well, support.",The Break-Up
348,terriwithani,I was delighted with this movie!,9,12 August 2006,"I've been putting off seeing this movie because of the low IMDb rating -- I almost always check out how viewers rate movies before taking them in. In this case, I have to say I don't know what those who rated this movie so low were expecting, but I was very entertained by it. It falls into the category of comedic drama as opposed to romantic comedy (or somewhere in between the two). I was expecting a ho hum ""supposed to be funny but I don't think so"" experience -- instead, me and a few other people at the screening I went to were laughing out loud at the many quick, witty slings and arrows that were being flung back and forth between ""Brooke"" and ""Gary"" as well as some of the other conversations between these two main characters and supporting cast members. I found the arguments to be be painfully realistic as in ""been there, said that, wished I hadn't"". I will be putting this movie on my recommend list and look forward to watching it again when it comes on cable TV. Great value for my entertainment dollar.",The Break-Up
349,mjwellman,A good look at relationships,9,21 October 2006,"It's difficult to walk the edge of humor and drama, but ""The Breakup"" does a good job of doing both. It's a wonderful look at relationships and how things can go wrong even when both parties are wanting the same thing. WARNING: I'm going to talk about the end of the film, so stop reading if you don't want to know how it ends. My hat's off to the writers and director for a good ending that doesn't sell out to the typical Hollywood/Disney ending. There's no magic point where the two characters come together to make it work. This movie was more like real life and the ending leaves it open to the viewers to decide on their fate.",The Break-Up
350,vircar2,Great real life movie about a break up,9,3 June 2006,"I loved this movie. It had it all- comedy and drama. I probably would call it a dramedy.I thought that all the characters did an excellent job. Kudos to the entire cast.My husband and I enjoyed it because it wasn't the usual ""Hollywood"" movie. It was too real-life for some people. Was it a movie that made you squirm? Possibly, because we have all had experiences like this one. We've taken our loved ones for granted, we've pushed our loved ones to the breaking point, we've all played our ""little"" psychological games on one another, we've all blown up at one another,we've all laughed with one another, we've all enjoyed one another's company and we've all loved one another. AND we've all broken up with someone in our lives.I was so impressed that this movie put it out there for all to see- warts and all. There were a lot of funny parts but there were some real serious parts as well.If you expect Wedding Crashers 2 this movie is not for you. Jennifer and Vince had remarkable chemistry.They both showed me that they can do dramatic roles too.Will it hit too close to home for some people- probably! I think after watching this movie you will think about how you have treated others and how you've been treated too.Funny but intense view on breaking up.We thoroughly enjoyed it. But I don't have to have the nice ""Hollywood"" endings.The ending reminds me of Before Sunrise.",The Break-Up
351,dwhite1957,Telly Savalas,1,20 June 2006,"This movie would have been much better if they were more realistic and actually showed Jennifer Anniston getting the full wax treatment. You know like in the 40-Year-Old Virgin. At the very least they should have showed her after it was done when she was walking around naked. We would be able to understand the movie from the Vince Vaughn character's point of view. It was hard for me to believe he could resist her at that time, maybe something went wrong with the wax job and I just missed it. Or maybe if Jen and her friend did a little girl on girl action that would have made Vince jealous, the guy thing didn't seem to work. Either way I think this would have helped me appreciate the fine acting and outstanding lines even more. Can't wait for the sequel...maybe Spider Man makes an appearance.",The Break-Up
352,Blue_London,"Funny and Witty, but it's Value is in the Uniqueness of its Resolution",7,23 February 2007,"Having heard bad things about this movie while it was in the theatre, I avoided it until it hit the DVD shelves. I just watched it, and I believe I understand where some of the negative feelings come from. However, I don't believe it's necessarily because of any obvious shortcomings of the film - the acting was good and the script quite funny - but rather because it presents a highly unconventional resolution.As I've warned already that this review contains spoilers, I will jump right to the chase. The film does not end the way you expect. The whole while I was expecting that it's going to end with Aniston and Vaughn realizing how much they love each other and getting back together for the big mushy romantic finale. This is not the case. They actually break up, and the movie ends with them running into each other on the street some time later and casually chatting before parting ways again. I was shocked. The point to be taken from this ending is debatable - it could be viewed as simply an incomplete reunion, suggesting that they will get back together again and all will be well. If this is the message you take, I can understand how you'd be disappointed in the movie overall, after all, they left out the best part, the feel-good romantic climax. However, I believe there is another message to be taken. That they don't get back together, but they are happy, and their lives fulfilled nonetheless - all without holding negative feelings towards the other person. In other words, a cinematic reflection of very contemporary ideas about relationships. 20 years ago you simply couldn't pull this off as a happy ending. Unless they made their relationship work it would be a lonely and dark finish to an otherwise funny movie. But the reality is, the resolution for Aniston and Vaughn reflects a situation that is all the more common and all the more acceptable in today's world. People meet, they form relationships, they have a good time, they have a bad time, and the relationship dissolves. But the dissolution of that relationship is not an ultimate moral or personal failure - simply a stumbling block in the broader script of their careers and lives. Gone are the days when we had to save our relationships at all costs for the sake of all that is good and happy in our lives. We, as a society have become more accepting of the temporal nature of love and commitment, and the notion that a relationship is an incredibly important piece of our broader life puzzle - but not the entirety of the puzzle itself. The idea that a ""happy ending"" can see Vaughn and Aniston end their relationship, learn something from the experience, move on to other successes (Vaughn's boat and Aniston's traveling) and yet still be happy with not only themselves but the other person is new to society and new to cinema.",The Break-Up
353,newvintagestudio,Annoying,4,19 October 2006,"I actually enjoy most all of the cast in this movie, but what a waste of time. Basically, it was depressing watching these immature retards be mean throughout the film.My friend, Vincent D, and the best actor in the world even seemed annoyed. NOT a comedy, a really great depiction of a waste of money.Why would anyone want to watch these moron characters be cruel to each other for 2 hours? STUPID....No wonder it flopped at the theater. It could have been funny, clever, but it simply was bad, depressing, and annoying. Jennifer A. needs to learn how to act.... or at least pick better roles.",The Break-Up
354,GreyDeath,Not A Comedy,3,6 November 2006,"This movie was actually billed as the funniest American Comedy of 2006. My girlfriend commented, three-quarters the way through, that it has about 20 minutes left to be funny, and that sums up this film quite well. There were humorous spots throughout the film, and I did laugh here and there, but I was expecting to be entertained by a funny film, just like the one we all saw in the trailers in the theater, but in the end, I had to ask, ""Why did I sit through this film?"" The acting was good, the story was OK, but it just wasn't a comedy. This film was a drama with a few funny points sprinkled throughout. I was constantly being reminded of the movie, ""War of the Roses"", which was also billed as a comedy, but instead was a dark drama with a lot of hate -- this film was along the same line: It shows the darker side of breaking up, the stupid comments made between couples, but... nothing really funny. How on earth do you get a comedy out of this film? Was there a shortage of comedies in 2006 so someone decided to just take a drama and drop it into the comedy category. Did you think no one would notice?",The Break-Up
355,heather_feather32,Not what I expected,5,3 June 2006,"This movie was not good at all! I expected so much better, especially from all the hype! Here are my cons from the movie: 1). Too much yelling between Brooke and Gary. Now, I *know* the title of the movie, but did they have to yell at each other *that* much? Just turned me off. 2). The foul language. The F word, the S word, and the G-D combo was just too much for me. I used to like Vince Vaughn, and it's so sad that he thought he had to add so much profanity. Awful. 3). The ending. I left the theater saying, ""What?""I wouldn't recommend it. Not until it comes to video or a dollar theater near you.",The Break-Up
356,emmy_fs_0425,"I really enjoyed it, what are the critics talking about??!?!",9,6 June 2006,"Good acting, good plot, good laughs, good serious moments, and good supporting cast. I just don't understand why the critics would rip apart this movie. I really liked it, and thought it was realistic and heartfelt. There were moments that I was just dying of laughter, and others where I really felt like I was gonna get all choked up. And Jennifer and Vince have great on-screen chemistry!!! You could tell that they had a good vibe together. I guess the only problem I had with the movie was the fact that the previews were a little misleading. It wasn't a comedy per se, but a movie with comedic elements. Vince was hilarious in those moments, but the movie was also quite serious at times. It was an honest movie, and despite what people have said about it, it's completely devoid of clichés. I recommend it. Guys will like it, because it'll teach them something!! And girls, you'll like it, too! Watch it!",The Break-Up
357,jen247good,Real and funny. A must-watch for anyone entering into a relationship,10,11 June 2006,"Yes, the long awaited Break-up was all that and more.I absolutely loved the movie. Jennifer Aniston is just amazing and talented. Her comic timing, her acting and her style. I loved every single thing she wore... down to her shoes.Vince is a great actor. He could loose a little bit of weight though. Together, both were great. They made the fight scenes look so real and understandably comic at the same time. Its fascinating.Some of my favorite parts were the fights. Those scenes were so realistic I think it made all of us pause and think about our own relationships. My husband isn't much of a 'chick-flick' lover but he found this one interesting.I highly recommend it. Its great for a romantic comedy.",The Break-Up
358,lmartenot,A moving film,9,18 August 2006,"Frankly, I have read quite a few critics and all the negative one are the facts that it's not as funny as expected, the trailer doesn't picture the film properly, it's not a comedy apart from a few quotes. It doesn't judge the film but only what they expected of it !! I must agree, it's not a funny film, not a comedy but a true picture of a relationship, its tension, its problems, its break-ups.I felt it was a well played movie with a great performance from Jennifer Aniston that for the first time came out of her ""Rachel"" character. The rest of the cast was very good and I can't see any performance failure.The first part of the film made me film very uncomfortable as it was very realistic, so well displaying the different emotion that one is felt in a day to day couple. Maybe it's a movie made for married people... single keep away !! Brilliant movie... but not a funny one !!",The Break-Up

I was waiting for the real big laughs, but then suddenly the movie ended. I thought I was watching the movie for almost one hour. I could not believe it, where was the comedy? I was expecting a fun comedy but it was more like a drama, which had an interesting story for a drama but not for a comedy.Too bad, this could have been a nice movie if there was real comedy in it.Just my two cents.",The Break-Up

361,dlinehan-1,What's so funny about screaming?,1,12 June 2006,"This was truly one of the very worst movies I ever saw. Though it started on a promising note, after five minutes I found myself guzzling an extra-large coke, just so I would have the excuse of going to the rest room to get away from it.My wife and I wanted a light-hearted evening away from the kids, and this movie looked promising. But light hearted it was not. We have a very peaceful life in our home, and I was unprepared for the amount of yelling that was dressed up as dialog. There wasn't anything funny about it. Probably 70% of the dialog consisted of people yelling at each other.We were probably taken in by the trailers, which made the movie appear a bit humorous. The only problem is that all the funny parts were in the trailer. Nothing else was a bit humorous.The only good parts were the first and last songs. The last one, ""I Can See Clearly Now"" made me see clearly why I should never go to an Aniston or Vaughn movie again.",The Break-Up
362,katiemetzroth,Closure?,7,5 June 2006,"This movie was better than I expected. While not a traditional romantic comedy, there was comedy and romance. There are lessons for anyone in a couple. The writers could have dropped her brother and one of his brothers from the movie and I wouldn't have minded...both made for extended awkward moments. But somehow, through the jerkiness of the movie, I wanted the couple to be happy or for her to hook up with the hot rich art guy. I actually cared what happened to them. Once I care about the characters, I prefer movies that have closure at the end. If they are broken up and that's it, fine. But, if they are broken up and they still have feelings for each other and are going to get together to look back on old times, that is annoying. I need closure or the promise of a sequel....and what in the world did he have in all those bags?",The Break-Up
363,doug_lusby,This is not a comedy; it's a tragedy. Advertise it as such.,3,3 June 2006,"The constant yelling and bickering in this movie are about as enjoyable as the average joe's life in a broken home. There is very little humor here, and what there is is swept under by the constant in-fighting. This movie is not the least bit romantic either. The conclusion of the movie doesn't seem realistic, though I won't give it away. There is very little to praise about this movie. I recommend strongly that, if you're longing for a new comedy, go see a pleasant surprise like 'R.V.' or wait for 'Cars' (though there's no guarantee it will be any good either; I haven't been particularly impressed by any of this summer's comedies--'Failure to Launch' included). Just don't break the bank on Break-Up.",The Break-Up
364,janiobi,Average Ro-Co Fare? I think not!,8,12 June 2006,"Despite all the negative reviews, I went and saw THE BREAK-UP this past weekend with a friend, because I love actors who act like themselves (Vince Vaughan and J.Aniston) and who makes tons of money to do it. And despite what everyone had said, I found myself quite in love with this film.What I like most about this film is its refreshing realism. You might think, ""WTF, Vince Vaughan celebrated for his refreshing realism???"" but I'm sorry, think back to the romantic comedies of late, like FAILURE TO LAUNCH, where Matthew McConaughey is befriending wild animals and parents are willing to pay strangers (albeit, very skinny, very tan, very-SJP-like strangers) to date their deadbeat sons...whose ex-girlfriends died of cancer...like what is that? Those movies make no sense and suffer from Plot Paralysis by Accumulating Unrealistic Incidents. After seeing that film, I feared the romantic comedy would be forever lost. Then along came THE BREAK-UP.This film is real: it shows a really great relationship between two realistic people crumbling apart and how the two try to tie the strings back together. It's different from your average romantic comedy because it actually COULD happen to you. I think that may have been the beef that many took with the film. I know people go to movies to ""suspend their disbelief,"" but when said suspension blinds us from seeing what great entertainment reality can be, I say it isn't worth it.I liked this film because it highlighted the ways in which a relationship can go wrong and yet showed you the faults of both people--no one was the victor, both had their problems. At times it was painful to watch...like when J.Aniston's (not) gay brother breaks into song, and especially when J.Aniston broke into sobs due to her heartache (but she was still pretty, don't worry). But in fact it was this awkwardness that made the film, in a way, even more appealing.I recommend THE BREAK-UP not only to Vince Vaughan or Jennifer Aniston fans--it's not their typical comedic movie (it's not slapstick funny or even ""haha"" funny throughout, but it sure isn't THE GOOD GIRL). I recommend it to anyone who wants a good ride: endearing, sentimental without being ridonkulous, and all over a nice change of pace from typical ro-co (i.e., romantic comedy) fare.",The Break-Up
365,blockheadry,"Wait, was this meant to be a Comedy ?",3,19 September 2015,"I like to give credit where credit is due, the acting in this film is actually decent, it just feels like it's in the wrong genre, This film is meant to be a Rom-Com, and even by Rom-Com standards, this film isn't good, the film is far,far to serious and depressing, there are really only TWO jokes in this entire film... and they both fall flat and just come off awkward.If this film was under the genre of a romantic drama I would probably rate the film a 5/10 but as it is a failed comedy it has to loose marks in my opinionSummary: Pros -The acting is not too badCons -For a comedy the film is way too serious and uncomfortable - The only 2 jokes in the entire film are easy, cheap jokes that some how still feel awkward and out of context",The Break-Up
366,defender289,Not what you might expect...,8,3 June 2006,"But still quite good if you can appreciate an intelligent, honest film that is sometimes hard to watch because reality is sometimes hard to watch. Yes, it's true, the movie was misbilled as a slapstick comedy, and so if you walk into the theater prepared for and expecting an unending stream of crass jokes and mentally unstimulating comedy, you will probably join the ranks of those screaming, ""It sucked so hard!"" This is almost a coming of age film, in which Gary (Vaughn) finally discovers what everyone around him has always known, he's a selfish prick. Really fun to be around, but a prick none-the-less. /This/ is part of the vital, brutal honesty this film lived on. I know it doesn't sound movie making, but it shows how so many people live their lives while deceiving themselves about who they are and what they deserve. Gary finally gets the picture, and as with anyone who experiences it, it is gut wrenching, life changing. This is the crux, the turning point and you think ""here comes the happy ending"", but it's honest here too. Thing don't always work out like they do in the movies, except for this movie. People also have complained about the ending, but I thought it well done. No you're not spoon fed completion, but you're left with hope and possibilities. Obviously they can now, at the very least, be very good friends, something that is very worthy in itself, but it is equally obvious that there is more behind their eyes than friendship and we leave the theater knowing that this might just work out. I stayed through the credits hoping for a ""this is what happened"" series of pictures (i.e. wedding photos or a new series of hanging out pictures mimicking the beginning), and was a bit disappointed that didn't appear. No matter however, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film.Oh, and Aniston did a pretty good job with emotional reality in the portions that called for it. Vaugh also did wonderful in his more subdued tones. He was just oozing denial and compensation for pain hiding just beneath the surface, showing a mask we've probably all worn. This film really highlights the dangers and foolishness of wearing our masks, of not being honest with the ones we love.",The Break-Up
367,DaniBee,I really fell asleep!,4,19 June 2006,"I recently saw this movie thinking I would be laughing my butt off, but about forty-five minutes into the movie, I dozed off for ten minutes. It was horrid. The few jokes they had were lame, and of course, just like *every* movie now, they had to have a stereotypical gay guy. I would call it more of a romance than a comedy, and even that part wasn't very good. Every part of the plot was the same as every dumb movie these days. You know...Guy loves girl, guy and girl fight, guy and girl try to get together again. I mean, the only surprise was the end. Which I hated with a passion. I mean, why did Jennifer Aniston's character, who really wanted to get back together, suddenly change her mind.Some parts were okay,though. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the beginning, and the parts where Vince Vaughn was talking to the bartender, because the bartender got a few laughs out of me, and Aniston's character's ""gay/straight"" brother. But all the other laughs had been played countless times on the TV and radio, and had already gotten old. Speaking of the commercials, most of this movie wasn't even about the condo! Most of it was about trying to make the other jealous. I', sorry if my review seems harsh, but these writers gotta get some original ideas.4.5 Stars out of 10.",The Break-Up
368,jbnunn-2,Disappointing,5,3 June 2006,"It's not the worst movie in the world, and it certainly has its redeeming qualities (namely Aniston)--but it's a let down. I think I would've liked it more had I not seen one preview, but this is one of those unfortunate movies that shows all its best moments in previews, and if you've seen more than 2 sets of the previews for ""The Breakup,"" you've seen the movie. There are only a few good interchanges with Favreau and Vaughn, and they still lack the chemistry they showed us in Swingers (not that they were trying to recreate it here).The fights (verbal arguments anyway) are realistic, which is good, but there's not much making up, and the movie ends on a sour note with no real resolution to their problems.Overall, it's entertaining enough if you're bored, and certainly better than a lot of other garbage I've seen this year, but don't expect too much.",The Break-Up
369,evantheraider05,Boring,2,2 June 2006,"Well I am a fan of the Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrel, etc. movies, but ""The Breakup"" was AWFUL.Let me say, it started off pretty funny, just like any Vince Vaughn movie. He did the monotoned funny monologue. The exposition of the movie is pretty amusing as you are introduced to everyone.Vince Vaughn works with his 2 brothers on a tour guide bus, and Jennifer Anniston works in an art gallery with a strange but funny boss and a gay, semi-drag-queen co worker, played by Justin Long from Dodgeball (in this movie he has long, straight, black hair and looks like a Chinese woman.) Towards the beginning, there is a scene where Anniston and Vaughn's families meet at dinner and you realize how Vaughn and Anniston's relationship is slowly declining...that is where it lost its spunk. ^ that scene is about 20 minutes- the rest is boring and not funny.As soon as they start fighting, the rest is them just whining and being mad at each other and thinking of ways to make each other jealous with Anniston going on dates and Vaughn having parties with his friends.From there, there is the occasional amusing line and the scene where you see Jennifer Anniston's butt.Even after breaking up, they still live together in their apartment because they need a place to live, and they have continuous disputes about whose room belongs to who (annoying). Jennifer Anniston starts to realize that she wants him back and invites him to a concert for a casual date. He does not show up, and she goes home and cries and whines. He explains to her that he wanted to go but blah blah blah. She tells him (while crying) that all she ever wanted from him was a little appreciation. This hits Vince Vaughn and he shows his appreciation.While she goes out one day, he cleans the house and makes dinner for her, and he does the ""I love you, I'm never going to hurt you"" cliché speech, and she has the non-cliché reaction- she tells him that she does not love him and they wind up selling their apartment. They both go their separate ways: he continues his tour guide business, and she travels for a while. They meet a few months after, and do the ""it's good to see you! you look great! how you been?"" conversation. You can definitely see that they are hiding their emotions behind their smiles and that they still want to be together. Then the best part of the movie happened. . . IT ENDED! I yelled ""free at last!"" after it ended.The movie is tedious, boring, and not amusing.",The Break-Up

It's not funny, it's depressing and at times it's downright stupid. Several cringable moments. I normally like them both but they were so annoying in this film it was uncanny. Vaughn is abrasive and Aniston is trite. If I had to describe it in one word it would be whiny. As other posters have noted, it is impossible to feel any affection for either. You just don't even care that they treat each other terribly and behave worse than children. Hard to believe they were going out when they made the film because they lack any chemistry.

His scenes are decent, amusing, quirky as his fans have come to expect from him, but nothing particularly outstanding in his long career of solid performances. There's no rush to lay out $5-$10 to see 'The Break-Up', just have NetFlix ship it to you in a couple of months.Jason Bateman is fantastic as Riggleman the real estate agent. He's perfectly smarmy and subtle and amusing. Too bad there isn't more of him in this film Everyone else is pretty much a disappointment...what I want to know is if you're not allowed to connect to the alleged romance (you never really see any PDA (physical display of affection) or signs of affection and tenderness between them until it's a foregone conclusion that their 'relationship' is history) between Brooke and Gary, how could you possibly *care* about their breaking up? Vince Vaughn's a huge disappointment (he was great in 'Thumbsucker', so if you're not familiar with that film, go rent it instead). As always Jennifer Aniston did *nada* for me -- I still don't get her appeal so I can't recommend something else she's done (sorry, you're on your own here Jen fans).",The Break-Up

The ending was confusing and disappointing though, but maybe it's because we were talking because we found out that Anthony likes Chrissy, even though Chrissy hates him. How could he? God! OK, sorry, back to the movie. One of our favorite parts was the family dinner scene, when they all start singing. It rocked!

Why couldn't they have put the boat scene last and at least ended on a slightly positive note? Bad acting, bad directing, just bad. Did I mention bad? A whole 1hr47mins of my life I'll never get back and boy am I bitter. I got in for free and I STILL want my money back, it was that disappointing.",The Break-Up
376,cthope,This movie is very poor,1,28 December 2006,"The movie was nothing but interpersonal conflict. The role played by Vince Vaughn was a shallow, waste of time and the role played by Jennifer Aniston started to reciprocate in kind... it was nothing but nasty conflict... my wife and I couldn't watch the whole thing it was so snide and petty... we put in Elizabethtown instead and LOVED that... don't bother with ""The Breakup""... not worth the rental fee... or time. Also, you might like ""The Great Raid""... we loved that also... We are big fans of ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Galaxy Quest"" etc and didn't care for the constant conflict of ""The Breakup"".

378,chineselaaundry,Don't READ if you want to see the movie because there are spoilers!!!,6,2 June 2006,"In all honesty, I hated the ending. I had a feeling that it would end the way it did, but come on; happy endings are why people created movies; real lives may not always end so happily, but with movies we can control what happens.So yeah, the movie could have ended without that last scene; because with the last scene, there was still the tinge of hope that they would get back together or at least one of them would call the other to set a date or something. but no. Audiences didn't get their chance at a happy ending this time! Overall though, I would say this movie was pretty good; Vaughn gave an excellent performance whereas Aniston...well she's just Aniston. Vaughn showed that he is still the wise guy who can talk up a storm and make people laugh, but still showed that serious side and really made you feel what he was feeling; his performance was almost perfect. But Aniston's character didn't seem like it took much talent; in all honesty I think any normal girl who was goodlooking enough could have played that part.I think the movie itself spoke to many people because the whole situation is something that I think many people experience; not with the whole apartment thing but the reasons why Brooke argued and broked up with Gary are things that people deal with in every relationship. And because it was almost too real, I guess that's why it needed that happy ending...",The Break-Up
379,seansyd2,"Break up of what, exactly?",6,1 June 2006,"OK, so Vince is funny as always. He skillfully delivers a slew of funny one liners. And of course Jen is beautiful, as expected. (there is a not-to-miss scene of her that just hammers home the mistake Mr. Pitt has made...) In the movie they break up, as advertised. Unfortunately other than these assets the movie offers little that one would expect from a romantic comedy. Think of Spanglish, not of any movie from the 90's with Meg Ryan. Whats missing here is any real reason for them to stay together. What we end up with is an at-times-funny movie that fails to sell itself to us because it displays no real value in their relationship. The result is that other than feeling a bit sorry for the characters, we don't really except what the plot tries to sell us; that they should keep trying to get back together. Its a bit of a sad movie in that all we are left with is a pretty strong feeling that they really should break up.",The Break-Up

They are different and maybe that makes them cute for each other!
It was a great example of an actual relationship in the real world the way he thinks and talks and all of his actions - like a man. Like a typical stubborn man who it's just himself - and the woman the other prospective of the relationship
Its shows very different kind of thinking - men's and women's

This movie is a successful comedy. (remember it is pg13 rated not r rated like the wedding crasher - so there are limits) Young and older people can identify with at least one character in the movie - whether they are in a relationship, offering advice, friend, sibling or co-worker. This movie displays real life not like the Wedding Crasher, Mission Impossible and etc. I am fan of Jennifer and Vince both as separate individuals or together if they want to be and they definitely have chemistry on the screen.

Second, if by his intention was to be a really annoying SOB, then top notch acting skills right there!I wanted to like this movie, but Vince is just not likeable if he's not remotely funny. And the entire movie turns out more irritating than entertaining, especially the first half.The stereotypical sloppy guy is portrayed unbelievably in a situation where a guy snags a gal who's way above his league, yet treats her horribly. I'm sorry, but this movie should have been classified as Fantasy.",The Break-Up
383,awsawyer,Boring,2,6 June 2006,"From the previews, The Break-up appeared to be a very funny romantic comedy. It couldn't have been more of the opposite. It was a very dark look into the final days of a relationship that began in a very odd and unlikely way. While Jennifer Anniston's was very believable, as she is in many of her films, we did not see enough of her character to understand why she reacted as she did in certain situations. Vince Vaughn, a normally hilarious actor, seemed too focus on fulfilling the expected role of a sports crazed, video-game playing, 30-something male. Therefore, any comedic attempts on his behalf failed miserably.To the movie's credit, however, Anniston and Vaughn were very believable. In fact, at times the movie felt like you were watching two of your ""friends"" (no pun intended, well, maybe some) in the death throws of a relationship (Hence, ""the break-up). The bright spots had to be high class acting by the supporting cast, a GREAT team.This movie is at best a DVD-rental, and if you pass by it in the aisle, you didn't miss much.",The Break-Up

This is not a good date movie, and it is certainly not funny, so I don't see what its draw is. The thing most people will be talking about is the ending. The ending was actually pretty realistic, but the movie did not earn it. The rest of the movie was too weak and stupid for a thought-provoking ending. It's like the writer said- ""Well, I don't want my movie to be generic and have them back together in the end, or have them move on with their lives. I'll just make it undeservedly ambiguous"". I almost fell asleep during this laugh-less ""comedy"" that just makes you feel like an idiot for wasting $9. Not worth seeing.",The Break-Up
385,Rogueborg2002,A disappointment,2,3 June 2006,"I had high hopes for the first film to debut Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn... too bad it was terrible. I thought the parts in the very beginning and in the dinner party scenes to be the highlight of the movie in which I actually laughed. The rest of the movie left me both terrified of Vince Vaughn and depressed.The interim fighting between Jennifer and Vince was incredibly awkward. (There were probably ten times in the film that I found it awkward to be watching what was occurring on the screen). There wasn't even a great soundtrack or much of any background noise to help coat the dialogue. I also was really annoyed with the ample amount of product placement ranging from 5 large Pepsi displays, certain types of chips, and two different video games. Some product placement is acceptable but I was really turned off with the amount that they kept showing GTA: San Andreas. The ending of the film was depressing and awkward. I had actually grown bored with the film probably about twenty minutes before the actual ending.I love both of these actors (Jennifer Aniston a bit more) and I think that she really took a role that was beneath her. Sorry for the disappointment folks.",The Break-Up
386,needrunaway,Poignant Movie,9,1 June 2006,"There have been several reviews maligning this movie. I think it's because they may have some pre-conceived notions that this movie will be full of non-stop laughs given that Vince and Jennifer are both comedic actors. I happen to think that this movie is excellent! True, the movie has many scenes where you will burst out laughing but there are also scenes which will touch you or even make you cry. What I like about this movie is that it's very realistic on how it portrays relationships especially when it's on the brink of dissolution. Because isn't that how life and relationships really are? It isn't always rosy, there has to be a mix of gray and blue, or it would be pretty boring.Jen and Vince did an awesome job in this movie as well as all the supporting casts. My only comment is on the script which may be a bit lacking in character development. Nonetheless the movie is a must see.I urge you to watch this movie with an open mind and you might take away a lesson or two after you finish viewing it.",The Break-Up

It has a honest ending. This is no ""War of the Roses"", but has many funny moments. Jennifer does a great job being the straight person. Don't get on the ""beat up on Anaston bandwagon"", and go see this movie. The only criticism I will say is, she needs a hamburger. Jon Favreau has a few choice moments. He and Vaugh team in their usual ""Swingers"" banter.Women who have dated or married (me) a selfish prick will really relate to this film. Judy Davis does a nice cameo.

Jennifer as usual showed that she does have the ability to act in this genre. There seemed to be a chemistry between her and Vince. I am not referring to their characters, I mean between the two of them on a personal level. I really believed they loved each other.Vince really showed he does have a soft side. Yes he still had some that charming humor that only he seems to be able to deliver, but I found myself wanting to love him even more than I already do.I really believe this movie is great for a couple to see together.

Vince and Jennifer's characters are flawed but still lovable and is so realistic in their relationship portrayal. Vince is a laid back, chauvinistic and selfish frat boy type that every woman has probably dated. Aniston is a passive-aggressive martyr that every woman has tried to be. The end? They both grow up and better themselves, although not with each other. Oh yeah, in the middle of all this is some very funny stuff. The entire theater was laughing out loud throughout the whole movie. Honestly, I don't know what the critics were saying, these two had great chemistry! The reason why many people may not like this movie is because it is not a cookie cutter romantic comedy (see How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Failure to Launch, etc). Its not a romantic movie at all, actually. The guy doesn't win the girl back with a tearful apology, there is no happy ending (though it is implied), it played out as how most break ups occur, with both parties clinging on to whatever they can to hold the relationship together, in this case, a shared condo.Bottom line- great movie!

Jennifer Aniston is adorable and Vince Vaughn is so funny and lovable that even when you know he's being a jerk~you still laugh at him! I think both men and women will love this movie because anyone whose been in a relationship can relate to what each of them is saying... The way they argue enhances their chemistry.

The WORST part was in multiple scenes you could see the Mic at the top of the screen...even if you tried to enjoy the movie that was extremely distracting. There seemed to be no chemistry between the actors. The only time you really ""believed"" Vaughn was when Aniston walked naked in front of him. I'm sure that was a very hard scene for him to get into character for. On a positive note, there were some scenes that felt like a page from my personal life.

So if your requisite for a movie is only ""par excellence"", skip it. If you want to have a little fun, commiserating with this couple in their comedy of errors, you won't be disappointed. All the characters are quirky, but there really isn't any mean-spirited dialogue, and I don't remember much 4 letter word usage, which was a nice change from Vince Vaughn's usual banter. Yes, the characters are stereotypical, but again, this movie is simply summer fluff. And like cotton candy, if you eat too much your teeth will hurt, but just a bit can make you smile.",The Break-Up

The movie was definitely different from what I expected. It was funny, emotional, sad, and happy all at the same time. While sitting with a theater full of people, there were many obvious choices of laughter. It was a good movie, different from any I've seen before but the reason I gave it a 6 was because the ending was awful. It ruined the entire movie. Everyone in the theater started murmuring after the credits started rolling because we were all shocked that it was over. No one realized that the last scene we saw was the last in the movie. I would say the movie is worth watching, just be prepared for a few laughs, smiles, and a few parts of sadness. Remember, don't expect too much. What you think will happen, won't.",The Break-Up

For anyone who has gone through a break up you can put yourself in their shoes saying exactly the same thing ""How in the world did we get here?"". It made me laugh throughout the movie but cry to know that sometimes it can be too late to make things right. The ending gave me hope that things happen for a reason and for the better even if you can't believe it at the time. People can change and be a better partner for the next one.

Don't get me wrong, I love when they end up together but this was a little different't and I liked it. Also, Jen and Vince did a spectacular job, I don't think i have ever laughed in a romantic movie as much as i did in this one. The movie is number one in the box office! I wish it to stay there for at least another week!I heard they were filming less then a month ago in Chicago to change the ending i hope they have the alternate one on the DVD.Jennifers body looked amazing in this movie. She is so skinny and even skinnier in real life. I saw her downtown when she was filming. She worked at M.D.G. in the movie and they filmed those scenes right by Le Perla and across from Nodstrom.

It wasn't your typical chick-flick, cheesy movie. That is exactly why I liked it. The movie made viewers see both sides of a break-up...miscommunication, hurt, and especially love. Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn did a great job in this movie. They really made you feel for them. For those of you who have experienced a break-up or had a friend who experienced a bad break-up, this movie depicts it pretty damn well. You have the lines that are drawn between the two, the friends that are always supportive and on your side, and the friends who are torn. I thought the supporting actors were also able to show their characters. They didn't candy-coat the intensity of a break-up and how it can change your life.

I thought it would be a very funny comedy drama, but while I was watching this movie, I was wondering if it was really funny. Yeah, it had few funny dialog, but even an action movie or a serious dramas have similar funny dialogs, but don't claim to be comedy. Although I didn't expect it to include lousy stuffs as we always see in typical comedy movies .... but I expected it to contain some matured funny stuffs (such as we've seen in Desperate housewives or in Curb Your Enthusiasm) ... but anyway, i was completely disappointed. It was a typical romantic movie, showing what typically happens (or could happen) between young couples and how small things could break up a relationship, how it affects someone's life and how other people react or even play a role in a break up. But was it really a comedy ? At least I didn't find anything too funny in the movie ... rather I think it's a sad romantic movie ... cause they finally broke up ... .. and the movie ended.

I think that a lot of people can really relate to the situations in this movie. Jennifer Anniston did a very good job at playing her role.

I like to get lost in the movie and this flaw kept jarring me back to the harsh reality that even pretty good movies need to be edited carefully! Otherwise it was, as noted, a pretty good movie, not worth all the hype, but then, few are. Mr. Vaughn was likable AND despicable though it was clear his character didn't have a clue what was wrong in the relationship. Ms. Aniston was lovely and haven't we all known - or been - somebody who played the perfect ""wife"" until it was too late to rectify the situation?!?

I cannot understand why critics aren't loving this movie unless it's the rather confusing marketing as a 'chick-flick' when really it's a dark comedy.Vince Vaughn is one of the funniest guys in the movies - if for no other reason, go see this movie to catch his hilarious improvised scenes with John Favreau! It's great watching his character interact with all his 'well-meaning' guy friends who give him atrocious relationship advice. Jennifer Anniston is also great! It's nice to watch her play better roles than her princessy character in Friends.The supporting cast all do more than their job keeping up the quality of this film - Judy Davis (one of my long-time favorites) goes way out of her typical characters to play a neurotic, egotistical art dealer.

405,jjjbush,"Could this movie be a preview of things to come for Vaughn? - Vince, hop the first plane to Africa!",4,7 June 2006,"I rarely go to the movies anymore with having three teen-agers who play sports, etc. I really wanted to see this movie because I thought it would be a great opportunity to see Vince and Jen on the big screen together, thus getting a chance to see their chemistry as a couple. Instead, I felt as if I was in the middle of an uncomfortable and very destructive relationship between two people. There was nothing romantic about this film. The beginning argument was cliché in the fact that it is the same old argument between most married couples. The man is lazy when he gets home and does not appreciate what his woman does for him at home. And the woman does everything and only asks her man to do simple things, which he will inevitably screw up. Welcome to my world! Anniston's character was cold and not the least bit romantic. It seems that everything she does is for show. Her family is kooky and she accepts them just fine. Unfortunately, for Anniston, this role had viewers commenting throughout the film ""No wonder Brad left her"". This is a bit unfair, and as adults we know this is just a movie, but one that Vaugn helped write. This movie did Jennifer Anniston a world of harm as a person who wants the world to know she was the victim of Bradgelina. Her character in this film shows a side of her that is unexplainable, really. I think Vince was wonderful as a typical male, stereotyped as a driven worker during the day,trying to earn enough money to make a life for himself and a family. He is the typical male who goes home in the evening, expecting to unwind in his own home and just be taken care of, as a man experiences from his mom all through his childhood. Lets face it - we all want our husbands to go home and help around the home and appreciate us, but the only problem is that women are nurturers and men are hunters and providers by nature. Men really do not care about how clean the home is, or how the dinner table looks. Unless you have a metro-sexual at home, all wives are in the same boat as Anniston's character in the move. You just do not feel sorry for her - my man would have told me that the grocer was out of lemons! I liked where this movie was going. but as soon as Vince and Jen have their first on-screen argument, and Vince leaves, I did not like the direction at all. Women typically try to find a way to make up and this script went against the nature of women, as a whole. Anniston's character makes you feel like she really loves Vaugn's character, and that she wants him back. She never backs down from her side of the argument, though, and evidently, the script is deceiving because the audience really does not know what Anniston's character wants. Most men will say this is typical and that women cannot be figured out. My girlfriends and I all saw our husbands in this I gave the movie a 4 for the smart adult comedic lines that came from Vince's character. Also the supporting roles from Vaugn's friends are good, but Anniston's circle of friends, including her family, are ridiculous and unbelievable. They are over the top, therefore the smart story line fades. The movie could have been funnier. For example, wouldn't it have been funny if Anniston's good looking date, who felt a real kinsship with Vaugn, was in the room with Vince during the card game when Jen returned from her girlfriend's house, after pretending to be on a date? By the way - was this character a therapist? The last fifteen minutes of the movie were so bad that my friend ran to the lobby to see if she could get her money back (which was a hefty $11.00). She goes to the movies every week, and she didn't even do that after we sat through Moulan Rouge! This is not a romantic comedy, but it could have been and that is the shame. A twist in the ending could have made everything better.",The Break-Up

407,nicole5045,The name kind of sums it up....,9,7 June 2006,"I LOVED this movie!! I thought it had a great mix of true life situations mixed with hilarious stuff you only find in the movies. It depicted the good, bad, and ugly parts of relationships and wasn't all laughs. This movie has a good plot and is very well written. It strays from the tired plots of most romantic comedies and gives you something new and, in my opinion, much more interesting. Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston are a great on screen duo and are really able to accomplish believability for the audience. Gary (Vince Vaughn's character) is the typical macho guy who wants to do what he wants to do. Anniston's character is easy for most women to relate to and wants what all women want in relationships. This movie is definitely worth the watch. If you liked movies such as Bruce Almighty, Hitch, Failure to Launch, or anything with Vince Vaughn in it, then don't miss this one.",The Break-Up
408,RobertClark333,Very disappointed,3,8 June 2006,"I haven't been this disappointed walking out of a movie in a very long time! The show had some funny moments and dialog, and Jennifer Anniston was beautiful and fun to watch for 2 hours, but as far as a story line, I was left empty and even angry. I realize the writers were trying to get away from the traditional formula Hollywood plot line and make it ""true to life"" or ""realistic"", but I don't go to movies and spend $8 to see real life depression and failure, especially in a movie billed as ""the best romantic comedy of the year"". I want the happy ending that's inspiring and that you can watch over and over again with your loved one when you want a romantic feel good movie (i.e. Hitch, You've Got Mail, Serendipity...). I probably would have felt better had it not been billed as a romantic comedy. It certainly wasn't very romantic.",The Break-Up
409,Dsivphx,The Break Up,7,8 June 2006,"I went to this movie yesterday at Harkins Fiesta 5 in Arizona. I enjoyed the movie but one thing that kept on annoying me about this film, THE MIC KEPT ON APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. I am not the only one that noticed this. Unless this theater got an unedited version of this film this movie was poorly edited. I continued seeing this Microphone appear several times in the movie. It almost makes one want to say out loud GET RID OF THE MICROPHONE..but the movie though, i did enjoy. I saw both sides of the relationship and its effects.If it wasn't for the goof up of that mic, the movie would've been much better..but good performances by the actors/actresses.",The Break-Up

Obviously I was left feeling very unsatisfied and ripped off. I want my money back. It started out all right and my friend and I had some good laughs but the ending totally ruined the whole movie experience for me that night. As I sat waiting for people to leave I heard the same comments from other movie goers also. I just hate when a movie wastes my time. Both actors were there just doing a job. Not that it was their fault. Well, a little maybe for choosing to be in this movie. Don't get me wrong, I understood the ending. The movie is called ""The Break Up"", so that was why it ended that way. They just broke up and went their separate ways. The End....Whoopdee doo.",The Break-Up
411,boorandy,"All drama, no comedy",5,11 June 2006,"When I think of romantic comedy I think of mostly comedy and a little drama. This was all drama an just a little comedy. The funny parts were very funny, but I spent more time crying. Their break up was so realistic that I found myself back in the middle of my divorce which took place 9 years ago. The acting was very good and it was all well cast. Vince D'Onofrio was great. You will like this movie if you know it is really a drama ahead of time, and want to see, a tear-jerker! This is certainly not a date movie and I wouldn't advise anyone who has been through a break-up recently to see it. If you are OK with all of that then you might enjoy it.",The Break-Up
412,smartalex-1,I was pleasantly surprised,8,11 June 2006,"I love relationship movies and I keep going to them hoping to see one that's good. While The Break-Up was not as good as my two favorite (About Last Night and Love Jones) it was very good. For one thing, I had low expectations due to the promotions. But besides that - there were some behaviors by both characters that were right on, so I was able to go ""yep, I've done that (and it didn't work for me either) or um hmm, so that's what my ex was trying to do (and it didn't work for him either). The movie portrays two people who at some point clearly enjoyed each others company - at the very least. But when the relationship comes to a impasse - as relationships always do, (when one person says - ""you know what enough all-ready,"" before the other person agrees to enough all-ready) we learn how ineffective manipulation and dishonesty is for relationship negotiation. However, we also learn that not all is lost when we make wrong choices. We can still learn a lesson or two and mature. And I liked that both characters learned lessons and matured. That's hopeful and encouraging.I recommend seeing the movie.",The Break-Up
413,hermansofwpb,What a disappointment :(,1,11 June 2006,"Went to see Vince Vaughn. When he first appeared on the scene I really didn't care for him, but he has grown on me. He's quite funny and charming. I liked Jennifer Aniston in Friends but don't consider her the greatest actress. However, with all the Brangelina mess, I really wanted this movie to score for her and Vince (they are a cute couple, even if they insist they aren't seeing each other...wink,wink)I thought, from the previews, that this movie was a comedy....did I miss something? It was a sadly depressing film of a couple fighting, screaming, yelling for one and a half hours. Oh did I forget to mention screaming??? I even covered my ears three different times from the yelling. Left the theater very disappointed and a little sad at having taken teens with me to see what we thought was a comedy. Too bad, they actually have great chemistry on screen, but unfortunately it was wasted.",The Break-Up
414,sasho_tomov,Two reasonable adults in a relationship break up for no reason.,4,14 June 2006,"When you put two stars with reasonable jobs (Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston) in a relationship set-up in Chicago, you need to move them further than just having them break up. The type of meant-to-be-funny everyday situations in a dysfunctional relationship that are all over the place in the movie easily get dry and by the end of the movie, one can only sit in the theater an crave for a cigarette or something. The characters are not well-developed and the motivation does not make sense. Therefore, a viewer is stuck with frustration and ends up despising both characters (and it is hard to despise Jennifer Aniston). When some change in the protagonist finally occurs, you are nothing but frustrated with both of them and you want the movie to end. The ending...It is good that they tried to go away from what you would expect, but when you do that, you need to make sure that the alternative is at least of equal quality. It is not a nicely told story, because the end does not bring any kind of mental or emotional satisfaction. If you are going to do such an experiment, don't throw it into mainstream Hollywood block-busters, because you will end up at the bottom with your finger there too.",The Break-Up
415,JMM_Texas,Who edited this thing?,5,12 June 2006,"I really did not enjoy the movie all that much. I actually expected a better movie from some of the reviews that I heard. It wasn't bad, but it just was not my type of move.Here is my question though... Who edited this movie. I have never seen a production that was filled with obvious goof ups as this one. I saw the microphone from the boom at least 6 or seven times in different shots. How does the editing team let this go? Also shots inside of the condo are obviously on a sound-stage. The illusion was not kept as you could at times see that there was no ceiling to the room. If you looked at the corner where the ceiling would meet the wall, all one would see is black.I'm in no way a critic, but if I noticed this stuff, why is it that no one else did from the editing group?",The Break-Up
416,keziah23,If I wanted reality I'd stay at home,1,12 June 2006,"there were a few laugh out lout funny scenes with V. Vaughn, but overall a waste of my money on what was billed as a romantic comedy in the trailers.The overall premise had some promise, but its like they couldn't decide what to do with the plot or the characters. If they had decided to make a ""real"" relationship movie it would have been good (maybe) if they had taken the ""I could have stayed home and had a fight with my SO"" stuff out and made it a comedy with the great comedic actors (Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn) they had it probably would have been great. It definitely had an identity crisis. I went away depressed.",The Break-Up

One patron leaving the theater said to an incoming patron, ""Go see Al Gores global warming movie. There may be some laughs in that."" There were a few points when I wanted to slash my wrists. Jen Aniston is cursed by ""Friends"" - she just can't make a good movie. God bless her, she tries, but they've all sucked. I wish her well in future endeavors - I'll go see her future movies because I am a fan.Some people who star in TV shows try to make the leap from the small screen to the big screen - some make it, some don't.",The Break-Up

It was absolutely hilarious!!! Then, without warning, it just ends with the most horrific disappointing ending in history! Which ends up ruining the last hour and a half of humor. There also are some parts that Vince's character's brother is quite, quite disgusting. It's been a whole 24 hours since I've seen the movie and I'm still so mad about the disappointment.I would not recommend seeing this movie, as you'll walk away so disappointed and wishing you had more resolution. However, I was very, very impressed with the acting and the very realistic fight scenes.",The Break-Up
419,kelligrant,Excellent Romantic Comedy,10,19 June 2006,"The Break Up was hysterical for those of us women who can completely relate to Jennifer Aniston's character! My husband and I laughed and I cried some. Ironically, my husband told me how much he appreciated all that I do and asked me out on a date after seeing the movie!! I highly recommend the movie to couples who have been dating awhile and definitely 30 somethings who are married. It was filled with realism and just plain old comedy. Vince Vaughn's character was so honest. The storyline was classic and kept the movie moving along at a good pace. The cast overall was perfect for the movie. If you like movies such as Sweet Home Alabama, you'll love this movie. Aniston does a great job on the big screen.",The Break-Up
420,aareffi,I saw this movie for free and I was robbed,1,20 June 2006,"You are likely to get more romance and comedy from any 2 consecutive hours of the news than you are from this film. It is clear that someone is directly to blame for screwing this movie up however, I don't believe it was any member of the cast. Vince, Jennifer and company gave a 110% but the story just wasn't there. About an hour into the film I found myself looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. It felt to me that when the director turned in his cut the studio didn't realize they had made a drama and then went back in and tried to ""fix"" it to match their marketing plan. Better luck next time.",The Break-Up
421,parke_ballantine,Surprisingly not crappy,8,22 June 2006,"I thought going to this movie that it would be another cutesy romantic comedy, but after a certain point (around when Jenifer Aniston's character comes back from her date with ""Mike""),I found myself relating to the characters in a more realistic way. It reminded me of the movie Closer, in that, it was a fairly accurate portrayal of love and break-ups (at the core)even with big name actors and a dramatic looking or funny, in this case, script. It did have the funny lines and cheesy parts and a most pointless part for Jon Favreau, but all in all I really enjoyed it and recommend it to those who seek something with a little bit more depth to it than the average Hollywood movie. A word of caution though, don't expect crazy amazingness, but some very poignant moments.",The Break-Up
422,balana87,hit home in a good way,8,26 June 2006,"This movie is a comedy, the funny parts are shown in the trailer, but The Break-up succeeded in accomplishing much more. Yes, it hit home. Yes, it was realistic. Yes, its just like life. But how often do you find a movie that is honest in telling you that people can be difficult? Everyone, even when you love someone, can fall into nagging or rejecting each other. The end also showed an honest way to let go of someone. I think the movie succeeded, perhaps not in a rolling on the floor comedy, but definitely made me feel something real. Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn did have outstanding chemistry. They were amazing in displaying the torn feeling of leaving the happy times behind and not knowing when it was really time to move on.",The Break-Up
423,itsnenagain,depressing!,3,28 September 2006,"My husband and I thought this would be a really cute Jennifer-Aniston type of film. Wake up! It had me cringing at times. I hated Vince Vaughn, and though his moronic friend was more irritating, at least HE could make me laugh. I don't know how Jennifer fell for him in the movie. There was nothing lovable about him at all until he cooked dinner and cleaned the house. I must say that the fighting was quite realistic with real issues, though the fighting and shouting made me squirm and my husband look at me uncomfortably to wonder if he made the same mistakes. But it was not enjoyable. I would not recommend this for anyone who wants to see a romantic comedy. I think Jen should have ended up with the 'sexy, rich-ass boy' instead.",The Break-Up
424,paddock89,"vaughn and aniston pack the punches, while the break up packs some heart",8,2 July 2006,"Ripping the sentimental bones from romantic comedy, The Break Up leaves love to rot. But with Vaughn and Aniston enlivening the stark material, the film's hard-heart does not beat in vain. He's fast and funny, she's grounded and glamorous. Pit the two against each other though, and the relationship turns cutthroat.As the indolent yet persuasive boyfriend, Vaughn and his dexterous mouth find countless opportunities to spit out some classic lines and harbor laughs. But unlike other movies such as Old School and The Wedding Crashers, where Vaughn's sense of humor becomes an entertaining substitute for character development, The Break Up makes him convey sincere sorrow and accept the repercussions. Despite the relationship may be doomed, at least Vaughn redeems his character. Co-star Aniston (a remarkable friend of the camera) who in 2005, failed to track as a femme fatale in the dull thriller Derailed, acted astray playing a black sheep in Rob Weiner's unsound Rumor Has It, is faring better in 2006. Recently Aniston starred in the indie film Friends with Money cashing in a rich performance, and with The Break Up Aniston has found a familiar yet legitimate role. She is feisty, honest, beautiful, wounded---she is what the part calls for: a woman. When Aniston looks at Vaughn incredulously, we know why, when she cries, our hearts go out to her. Together they become immature children, a pair of villains, volleying contenders, or should I say, two real people.Writers Jeremy Garelick and Ray Lavender don't necessarily break new ground when it comes to the jarring differences between men and women, but they make good use of it. Augmented by the two leads, a quirky supporting cast, some neat cinematography, a fitting score, and the Windy-City as a refreshing backdrop, The Break Up is a quality movie about love and war. Though it vacillates between comedy and drama, and in turn, drags from time to time, the film packs heart behind its convictions. Unsurprisingly, Vaughn and Aniston are most fun to watch when they are making each other's cheek bones rise and their eyes sparkle. But, regardless, The Break Up's intentions are unequivocal.",The Break-Up
425,jillgr,Very good movie for what it actually is,8,3 July 2006,"If you just go with this movie instead of fighting it because it doesn't meet your expectations, it is quite a good movie. It isn't a comedy, although it does have some funny parts. I like movies that are experiences, and this movie is an experience. You can laugh and cry, you can like people and yet disapprove of them, you can criticize and later forgive, you can disagree and yet understand. It's all there. It's like life. This movie has little moments of truth. The moments aren't always pleasant. Sometimes they are painful. Relationships are very complex, and I think they put as much of that into this 2-hour movie as they could. I thought the performances, including those of ""smaller"" roles, were very good. This is a movie I would like to see again. It is that good.",The Break-Up
426,rebter,Couple breaks up after frustrated egos fail to communicate with each other.,2,3 July 2006,"Once again, Vince Vaughn's subtle comedic genius has risen to carry the show. Jennifer Aniston....well, no comment. Actually, I will comment. She plays the same type of bland character in all of her movies. I really want to like her but I just don't see much depth in anything she ever does. The story line was one that all can relate to in the dating world. The beginning was a little bit too fast in the character development. I would have liked to see more of their relationship before the difficulties occurred. I don't think this is a spoiler??? Is it?? I had hopes of a different-ending and it could have ended sooner that later.",The Break-Up
427,abane003,Not what I expected...,9,5 July 2006,"When I left the theater, I hated this movie. That was two days ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. I've changed my mind. Overall, this movie has gotten some poor reviews, but I think this is largely due to the fact that the movie is advertised as lighter comedy, more like ""Wedding Crashers"", or ""Old School,"" and movie-goers are not getting what they expected. ""The Break-up"" is a much more serious, much more heart-wrenching film. I went to see this movie by myself one afternoon after a bad week at work, thinking that a light comedy would lift my spirits. I felt awful afterward, not uplifted. However, I keep thinking back to it. The acting is excellent, especially Vaughn. There are moments where a single look in his eyes communicates everything I've felt in the moments/ weeks following break-ups in my own relationships. Yes, I cried. Aniston also does an excellent job. There are just enough funny parts to keep you from bawling through the entire movie, but don't choose this movie if you're in the mood for a true comedy. And you may feel awful afterward. But it's the kind of movie that you think about later, and you feel enriched having seen it.",The Break-Up

The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the ending. While you're watching the movie you get to know the characters and you really hope that in the end you see them get back together and live happily ever after but with this movie you can't be really sure if they ever do. I thought that Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn did a great job playing these rolls and I could'not think of anyone else who would have given these characters more personality than these 2 actors did.

430,sharvey100,Worst Movie Ever Made,1,21 July 2006,"This movie was not a romantic comedy by any means which was what I was lead to believe by the previews. It wasn't even romantic. I may have uttered a slight giggle on two, possibly three occasions during the movie.Simply put, it was a horrible waste of time. Watching these two people go through all the crap they created and were too proud to fix only made my wife and I dredge up all the regrettable things we had done or said during our marriage (first, only, and still going).Instead of being uplifted and entertained as we had been deceived into thinking, we left with a bad taste in our mouths and disgusted that we'd just wasted 2 hours of our lives, not to mention the money we spent.To sum up, it really made us look forward to The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. With that movie, it's clear we're going to get exactly what we expect and pay for. And we can't wait! Do yourself a favor, skip this one and remove it from your NetFlix queue.",The Break-Up

Vince Vaughn was the typical guy who doesn't realize what the problem is with the relationship. Jennifer Aniston portrays an excellent girlfriend who has had enough of her boyfriends selfishness! I think they did a great job of writing the film outside of the fantasy/Hollywood life and brought it close to the ""real world"" relationship. For once,Jennifer Aniston had a good role and she played it well. I laughed a lot, especially at the friend. I HATED the ending. 2 hours of expecting something to happen and then NOTHING!!

In my opinion the movie is realistic, no matter how absurd it might seem, things are like that. And the ending might not be what everyone wanted to see too, but at least leaves it open.

No, not because we can somehow relate as perpetrators, but because it is so ridiculously sappy, boring, vapid and long... at least compared to the 30 minute sitcom episode it should have been.

They try to make it so that you'll root for the characters to get back together and work out their problems, when each of them comes off as self-centered and inconsiderate. Actors Vaughn and Aniston - they are each funny in their own right, but somehow the script to this film does little to utilize the comedic aspects of either of them. They didn't write it, and if they did we'd have been better off. They are each funny on their own, and one would think they'd do well together. Unfortunately, this falls short of that mark. We want to see them have a happy ending, because we all want to be happy. We want them to fight it out, because we want them to make up, then, in the end of it all, it's suddenly supposed to be okay that none of that ever happens. Some call it realistic, i call it bad scripting.",The Break-Up

As for it being a comedy, while there is some comical scenes in the film they always have a underlining of a serious, darker (sometimes vague) issues that remains unresolved until the end. The ending is not at all a ending, but just another beginning unto a more power to the individual and not a couple life or love between to be people at all. There is a lot of verbal fighting in the movie between the two main characters and others. Some scenes are actually pretty intense in the fighting. All of it leads to a movie that shows the building and breaking down of a relationship.

Boy and girl meet, we see some photos and then they are living together. We never get to see anything to care about their relationship. OK, they are living together, but if they can't solve such a minor problem, a common problem, it means they didn't know or care for each other, but hey, they are living together. Does.not.compute.If they were going to make them break up, at least they should have given a real, solid reason. When Brooke said, ""I'm leaving you"" I was all ""whaaaat?. Why so much hate? So soon in the movie?"" A problem that could have been answered if we knew more about them. I have had worse fights with my boyfriend, maybe the difference is that we actually love each other. The guy didn't care at all. She was later going out with other guys ""to make him jealous"" and he kept playing videogames like nothing. Come on! (I like playing videogames but if I saw the person I love going out with another person I wouldn't keep playing like an idiot).Then the guy brought sluts to their house and she suddenly wanted him back. For some reason he didn't want to. Then out of pity for seeing her crying he was willing to change. He had to see her cry to do something? He didn't need to be Einstein to figure out she was hurt from the beginning. She says no more. Good thing, because they didn't love each other. Damn, if some day I find myself yelling at my boyfriend for lemons, that will mean that either I'm crazy, or that love is not in the air and I'm just looking for excuses to dump him. At least they didn't date again in the ending, that would have been too much. That's why it's getting a 3/10 from me, and because of the few funny moments (and I do mean FEW).That was the plot. The technical aspects of the movie were below average. Bad edition, some continuity mistakes, boring shots.. visually, it had nothing special, not that I would expect it in this kind of movie.

Please, spare me. If their diaper rash had a smell, these types would be mistaken for garbage dumps.Now, back to The Break-up. Whom do you blame for such a silly film with such a silly premise? The actors? The writers? The directors? All of them. And it's all part of the snowball effect when the less each individual brings to the table, the bigger the snowball becomes, only to melt right before our eyes with complete dissatisfaction. The actors are probably most to blame because it's their job to lift the typed words into the air with truth, believability and conviction. And it's their job to question every direction the story is going in, weighing all of it against their real lives or the lives of friends or great imagination. Yes, imagination. This, they don't have because they are relying on nice asses or yelling to pull it off. Sorry, they are only pulling something else. And when a half-ass director can't realize the enormous red flags going off, then they're equally to blame. These red flags don't show up suddenly when the camera starts rolling. They're there the day the title page is turned for the first time, so don't tell me ""no time to improve."" Is it not the director's job to guide the story, even taking turns away from the script to help? A script is supposed to be a road map, not an unyielding rail that prevents veering off a bit to include great thoughts and ideas.I know this may be a bit extreme for such a fluff, but still there's a principle here... Where is the truth of a Cassevette? Where is the authenticity of a Chavesky? Where is the conviction of a Streep? Not in this film and with mentioning these greats I must add, this caliber is rarely reached, but all the greats right below them would still be extraordinary, but right below them you'd still find remarkable talent, and even below them, you'd still find a group of actors and directors and writers that really care about bringing something to the table and where their biggest concern is to make a film really good.This turkey of a film and all it's culprits- seemingly only taking advantage of their celeb status (what a surprise) are so far down on the ladder of talent, it could only make sense that their best work got wrapped up perfectly for a great minute-made trailer... Sadly, that was the best part of this film and many other films that almost purposely avoid the principles. Watch the trailers... maybe giggle... then run into the bathroom and take a hot shower.I avoided a 1 because of a couple of good jokes.",The Break-Up

At best adult content not fit for children- unless you think they need to be exposed to other people doing stupid, adult games. I recommend counseling with a good psychiatrist for the idiot who rated it pg-13. I don't recommend this for adults in good relationships and highly recommend don't watch if you are in an, at best, rocky relationship. Empathise with the characters at your own risk. What was the moron's name who called this a comedy? I spent two hours searching the web to find a program to play the DVD and wish I hadn't bothered. If there is a sequel I wouldn't waste the money to rent it, let alone watch it. Come for the pain because there is nothing worth a laugh in this film. The performances by the actors was stellar, what a shame this one was mislabeled as a comedy.",The Break-Up
443,rrowe2047,"Good movie, but Drama......not comedy",7,23 October 2006,"I did think this movie was good. If it had been marketed as a drama, I would have given it a higher vote. Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaugh were very good, but it was a sad movie with only some funny parts. I am glad I knew how it ended before I saw it, or I would have been really upset! I started crying half way thru the movie and by the end was pretty much sobbing. Now, I am a baby, but still it was hard to watch a show that was only about a crumbling relationship. It would have been better to get to see more of the happy times before it all fell apart, but I guess they do only have so much time to tell the story. Again, I recommend it, as long as you go into it knowing it is sad and ends bad.",The Break-Up
444,djdhays,A true let down.,5,20 November 2006,"What a cast! I couldn't wait to see this movie. It really had potential. I watched convinced it was even better than I had hoped. So it wasn't the laugh fest the trailers would have you believe. That's OK. I listened to Jennifer (Brooke) list her complaints and it was like deja vous. I waited on the edge of my seat for Vince (Gary) to say the magic words that would make her understand how much he loved her so I could use them. This movie had all the makings of a good movie. Too bad they forgot the happy ending. It seems like someone forgot that people go to the movies to be entertained. When I watch what I expect to be a love story I can accept a tragic death that keeps the lovers forever apart. I can accept many different endings. But when the movie ends with two people who love each other being forever unhappy because of childish expectations it goes too far. I can't imagine how miserable our lives would have been if my wife or I had given up as easily as Brooke did. I guess in the sequel Brooke grows old and dies alone all the while telling herself that she doesn't need anyone to be happy. Whatever helps you sleep at night. Like it or not, movies shape our society and one that suggests that giving up on love is the answer for imperfection gets low marks from me. The cast did the best they could with what they had but writing was needed to pull this one off.",The Break-Up
445,nananea,Don't rent it,2,20 November 2006,"The film opens with how Gary (Vaughn) first met Brooke (Aniston) and a Cubes game in Chicago. They seemed to have what was a fun and happy relationship so much so that they bought a condo together. Of course the audience never sees what they see in each other and the only hint of happiness is during the opening credits which splash pictures upon the screen of these once romantic times.After a dinner hosted by Brooke for both side's family members and to absolutely no help of Gary, the couple has one of those fights, the one where it just takes a trivial little incident to escalate an argument into a blow out. The couple's break up argument was so candid and honest it echoes many a break up conversation that I've had and many a friend has had. It was dirty and unkind and makes you thoroughly disgusted with both participants.At the beginning of the film I was just so put off by the physical state of my once lusted over Vince Vaughn I had a hard time staying in the moment. He looks much like a recovering alcoholic complete with back fat, beer belly and little pockets of fat that enhance his under eye shadows. I didn't even know it was possible for someone to gain weight under their eyes.Then there's the practicality of the situation in which we find the unhappy couple. They own what in the Chicago real estate market is an easy $300,000+ condo together supported by earnings from Gary (family owned tour guide business) and Brooke (works in a gallery). It is alluded to that Brooke's father sits on a board somewhere and therefore her family has money and that is almost a completely overdone background for any movie character.It's almost cliché really- upper crust daughter of some culture arts director, works in a gallery, owns a condo she can't afford with a loser, well actually now it's sounding more like a plausible situation. I'm convinced that Aniston takes on roles in which her character has a great job so that she can wear an equally fabulous wardrobe to work.I don't recommend the Break Up and I wouldn't rent it again, however I LOOOVVVEEE Brooke's wardrobe and am probably going to spend hours Googling for movie stills. Her wardroom is very cosmopolitan, a lot of dresses in a palette of neutral colors, lots of white and black and silk body hugging dresses and nothing above the knee. Aniston does Prada and Calvin Klein like no other and her wardrobe in this film closely resembles the minimalism that she adheres to off screen as well. She is pure chic in paired down elegance with a great use of jewelry and accessories.By the last scene in the movie, some time has lapsed since the beginning of the story which is evident in the blindingly white teeth of Brooke and the still sallow complexion but noticeably thinner Gary. Interestingly this scene bares tribute to the real time that lapse in the post production of the film. Apparently when the movie was screened before an audience people were less than thrilled about the ending and it was re-shot months later.If only Brooke and Gary's on screen relationship began with the same self improvement as was achieved in the end. Not all relationships work out and watching this movie you can see why and relive the same bitter sweet realization that sometimes it's just best to move on, and rent another movie.",The Break-Up
446,Jay_Visionary,Beautiful,8,27 December 2006,"This movie was beautiful. My sister-in-law saw before me and said she didn't like it, but that didn't stop me from buying it on DVD. I love Vince Vaughn, so I was excited to see this. Right off the bat, in the first scene, its comedic. The first scene with John Faveur gives off that magic they had in Made. It sets the tone for the movie and from there, the movie delivers. Jennifer Aniston is pretty good, not her best performance, but its good enough. Vince's child like attitude in the movie is what makes the movie what it is. Vince and Jen do not go tit for tat in the movie which saves this from being to comedic and cliché. Their's emotion in the movie and meaning to it. The ending just topped it off. It was magic.

The worst part of all is that I can never get my husband to watch a ""chick flick"" with me....I finally get him to agree to watch one and we get this.....I'm sure it will be the next millennium before he agrees to get another ""girls"" movie again !!!!

People that complain that the ending of this movie leaves you hanging are most likely the same popcorn genre moviegoers that enjoy Godzilla 2000 and other such fair.This is a great comedy because it is an actual story about characters that could actually exist in real life. The humor comes from real scenarios rather than one-liners, which allows the film to build in some drama as well.I will concede that if you come to this movie excepting the gut-splitting laughs of Old School you will be disappointed. However, if you truly love film and a good story and want a date movie that both sexes will truly enjoy this film comes highly recommended.

Next time don't hire a monkey and his pet banana to write the script. Also, try actually thinking through what actual men and woman are like and try to portray that instead of some ridiculous parody. This movie sets back mankind and relationships in general to the stone-age. Lets agree that we are all humans and can be flawed but, the way this is portrayed is too extraordinarily silly. Grow up and let your writing do the same. And just for your benefit, next time, and I seriously hope there won't be a next time, try hiring someone who can ACT. Jennifer is so pitiful and obviously out of any element. You really should not hire people on looks or their asses. I felt sorry for most of the men in this film. I don't think they enjoyed being there either. This movie is destined to be long forgotten.",The Break-Up

People can really take something away from what happened to Vaughn's character, but the entire plot was just dull. I wouldn't recommend anyone see this movie unless you feel like you must see every Vince Vaughn movie. Maybe see it if you have nothing better to do on a lazy Sunday afternoon or something like that, but overall not something I plan on watching ever again.

In BoB, you're not watching a drama with plots and sub-plots; it's just how the war happened.Everyone gives a flawless effort with acting.

You are there unsure of what to do and wishing that it never happened. Even worse if you are friends with both parties to a good level, you are hoping that you don't have to pick sides.The Break-up is basically just that. It leaves you watching the movie in an awkward state. The actors do a decent job of portraying what we all know happens in the real life... enjoying the pleasures of love and hating the hurt it can apply. It portrays beyond just Brooke (Aniston) and Gary (Vaughn) but to their family, friends, social life, and even to the work life.Its a reality check in the sense of that it doesn't skimp out of the intensity of couple fights and the effects that it burdens on the rest of life. It demonstrates the drastic cause of miscommunication and stubbornness in a relationship. And when it comes down to the finish line, it leaves room for either of two possibilities of what becomes of relationships. It leaves heads nodding in an agreement whether for the point of view for the ladies or for the men.The film is worth watching. The rating is based upon those who don't like to muster the reality of potential break-ups through the awkwardness, raised voices, and negative effects of stubborn minds. Besides, the movie has Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Long that create enough of a comical environment it takes to witness a simulation of reality. Even supporting characters such as Jon Favreau and Judy Davis add to make it worth watching. Give it a shot. You will end up liking it because it portrays reality instead of Fantasyland.",The Break-Up

I went to see it as a break from everyday life, and found myself surprised at how enjoyable and realistic the conflict comes from breaking up. The pain and laughter was understandable and true this was a movie. But the winning point in my opinion was the ending, the film is not so much a comedy as one expects it to be, it is no Wedding Crashers or Along Came Polly. It's about two semi-normal people trying to reconcile a failed relationship from different vantage points and in the end one realizes they can no longer live this life this way. It's a bittersweet ending, but appropriate, leaving the viewer with the feeling that if nothing else Gary and Brooke might someday be able to really be friends again.

Bad scripting, bad story, and the whole movie leaves a bad taste for the two main characters. After watching half the movie, you wonder how these two had managed to get together in the first place and gotten to the point where they wanted to move into the condo with one another. The movie is not about one trying to force the other out of the condo, because neither can afford it on their own in the first place, but it's really about one trying to force the other to admit that their relationship is bad because it was the others fault. The end of the movie comes suddenly and you're left there wondering what it was all for.

458,RedRooster99,"Entertaining, Memorable, and somehow Disapointingly Realistic",7,3 June 2006,"If you're going to see this film thinking it's a romantic comedy, stop thinking that. It may have been marketed as a romantic comedy, it may be listed as a romantic comedy, it may even feel like one when you're watching it, but it's not. Romantic comedies always end with everything working out.The makers of The Break-Up took a huge risk with this one, and I don't think the American audience will appreciate it very well. I appreciated it, but in a different way, and I'm still having a hard time deciding if I actually liked to movie or not.On the one hand, you have the superb performances of Anniston and Vaughn, both in their element, and together pulling off a very convincing couple with plenty of chemistry. On the same hand you have several very funny scenes, Vince Vaughn lines, and an excellent portrayal of the different ways men and women think.However, Nobody really wins in the end, or at least not the way you want anyone to win. No, they don't get back together in the end. This may be one spoiler you actually want to know going in. The surprise is not very pleasant, especially when we are so used to the romantic man swinging in at the last second, or even later, to save the day and apologize and get the girl. In this film, you never see it coming. You keep thinking something's going to happen, that they'll get back together, until the credits roll, and then you see the end titles, and finally the big blue MPAA screen, and then the loud garbled sound of the film running out with random scribbles on the screen, and then you're all alone in the theater. Then it hits you. They're not getting back together. Instead, it actually takes a realistic route, and the two stay apart. At the very end, we see that both characters end up as friends, and are even changed people, better people. Somewhere in that we're supposed to find the happy ending. As I said, I don't know if the general American audience can handle it.I at least found the difference refreshing, and almost like it. It really defies it's ascribed genre, and that makes it confusing. If the movie had only been marketed differently...Should you see this movie? Absolutely, unless you can't handle the defies-all-norms ending. This film is more than it seems, with a deeper point than the cliché ""Love Conquers All"" theme.",The Break-Up

I can really see the true feelings and struggles coming from what she had just gone through. And Vince, the typical American big boy, talented but immature within as he presented in the show. just suits the role well. It doesn't have to be a hilarious comedy or a fairy-tale like romance, what we got here is a delicate emotional depiction of something very true in one's life. Jen, due to the broken family experience in her early life and the nature of Aquarius, is sweet but a woman who can't be easily loved.

Actually, I was happy to see that Aniston can act beyond the stereotype of 'Friends' and hopefully has much more to give. In addition, the second roles were absolutely hilarious giving much more to the leading roles. If I had to compare it with another movie, I have to say that it gave me the same feeling like ""You've got mail"" and ""When Harry met Sally"".It's worth mentioning that there was enough chemistry between the leading couple that made the whole story more convincing.

The movie was a throwback to a simpler time in cinema. It wasn't attempting to be grand or deep or abstract. Its entire point was to create concrete, relate-able characters. Vince Vaughns role as Gary Everyguy was round enough to encompass a little bit of every male stereotype, as well as Jennifer Anistons Miss Cultured.

If you haven't seen the movie yet, and you're expecting the standard uplifting romantic comedy plot, this movie might not be for you. Vince Vaughn is perfectly cast in this movie, playing possibly the best on-screen jerk I've ever seen. Jennifer Aniston does a great job of playing a sensitive woman, but without the stereotypical weakness and dependency. It's rare to see a movie with so many genuinely funny scenes that also touching and deep. Throughout the movie, it really hurts to see two people pick at each other so viciously. It will definitely touch a chord for anyone who has ever been in a loving relationship that simply wasn't meant to be.

I read some comments on this website where peolple were saying the movie was no good, they must have no sense of humor or just don't get Vaughns humor.

Absolutely never ever had as little a shy smile on my face, there just aren't any jokes worth laughing about in this movie.Both Vince and Jennifer's characters are not appealing to me. They are flat, undimensional and tiresome.The antics shown are also completely un-inspired.I was very disappointed by this movie.The only thing I found refreshing, and here be spoilers, is that at the end, very UN-American, they don't get back together again.But that isn't enough to warrant this movie a viewing.",The Break-Up
474,jessicamariewalk,Shouldve been rated R,9,11 June 2006,"I think this movie was an excellent reflection of ADULT relationships...but the movie was PG-13. So, the reality of the humor and serious parts were totally lost on the target audience -- I mean, come on, how many 16 year olds know what a condo is and the issues with selling one. 16 yr olds argue about who said hi to who in the high school hallway, not who will do the dishes after a long day of work. If, however, the movie were rated R, then they woudlve been able to make it funnier because they could include more ""Adult"" material AND it would encourage more adults to go see it. So, the movie should've been made R rated. That being said, I did still really like the movie. It was almost too good of a reflection of reality -- I found my eyes welling up at parts because of how much it resembled my own past break-ups!",The Break-Up
475,killedbydolls,no laughs,1,3 June 2006,"I work at a theater and get to see all sorts of movies for free. But, by the end of The Break Up I wanted money back for the waste of time. The entire movie reminded me of Tom Hanks's old movie The Money Pit, but without the humor or the happy ending. Trust me, save yourself some money and watch anything else. The Break Up is one movie that makes you feel worse than you did going in. Jennifer's character breaks up with Vince. Then gets mad at Vince cause he stands her up at some concert. So she finally tells Vince how she feels about how she has put all this work into the relationship and does not feel the same from him. When Vince tries to do what she has always wanted of him, all of a sudden she doesn't love him anymore. Doesn't make me believe she puts to much effort into that relationship.

477,aligray,More bitter than a bowful of lemons and just as sharp,8,30 July 2006,"Not all of us can claim to have crashed weddings, hosted a sorority in our house or entered a Dodgeball tournament, but it's probably fair to say most of us have gone through a break-up of some sort. The harsh words yelled in anger, the resulting fallout and the awkward attempts at reconciliation that follow; not exactly the best concept for a comedy you might think, and you'd be right. Don't get me wrong, The Break-Up is indeed very funny, but it's also bang on the nose in its wry analysis of relationships and how they break down. It's more bitter than a bowlful of lemons and just as sharp.Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston) meet a baseball game, and one photo montage later, their relationship is well established. Set perfectly to the tune of Queen's 'You're My Best Friend', the pictures of Vince and Jen cuddling might well have come from the pages of the National Enquirer. However, it's clear they have differences  Gary, very much a guy's guy, likes to spend time doing things like playing Grand Theft Auto (don't we all) and wants to install a pool table in the couple's shared apartment. Brooke, however, likes entertaining her family and having evenings in, and thinks a pool table would disturb the apartment's feng shui. As serious cracks start to show in the relationship and a split becomes inevitable, it's clear that one of the couple will have to move out of the apartment, but no matter how many strip poker nights Gary throws or impromptu barbershop sessions Brooke organises, neither will budge.The ads and the trailers you might have seen are slightly misleading: The Break-Up is not all about the couple waging mental warfare on each other, or as the marketing execs handily labelled it, competing in the 'Ex Games'. Much fun is had with the obsessive one-upmanship between the two, but the real laughs come from the familiarity of the situations the couple find themselves in. Post dinner party, Brooke requests Gary's help with the dishes, a task which he grudgingly accepts. ""Wait, this isn't what I want,"" says Brooke abruptly. ""I want you to want to do the dishes."" A pause. ""Why would I want to do dishes?"" comes Gary's response. It's this kind of pointed back and forth that rings so true, the verbal jousting and skirting of the real issues that will connect with the audience  it's bringing the loves and lives of Hollywood superstars right down to the level of your average Mr. and Mrs. The hatred of the other half's family members, the segregated shared friends, the chronic nagging when all you want to do is sit down for five minutes it paints a fine picture of relationships which is refreshingly free of that thick coat of movie gloss.Vaughn, predictably, is fantastic. I've said before I could wet myself laughing watching the guy read the back of a cereal packet, but here he's on lightning form, whether he's smooth-talking his way into Brooke's life in the opening scene or trash-talking a fellow Xbox Live player once he's relegated to the sofa (""Would your mother love you less if she knew how bad I beat you?""). Even better, he's paired up with Swingers partner Jon Favreau as best buddy Johnny O, and although the two have clearly eaten the rest of the gang between them, there's still no stopping that 'Vegas baby!' banter they share. Given their (supposed) real-life relationship, there's definitely some on-screen chemistry between Vaughn and Aniston (definitely more than Brad and Angelina showed in Mr. & Mrs. Smith anyway) and if they don't 100% convince when they're sharing tender scenes together, they certainly look like they're drawing on some real emotions when they're taking chunks out of each other. The Break-Up doesn't pull its punches when it comes to dishing out the abuse, and to give them their dues, Vince and Jen give it their all. Credit to the supporting players too; Vincent D'Onofrio and Cole Hauser are awkward and repellent respectively as Gary's brothers, while John Michael Higgins is hilarious as Brooke's musical brother, a cousin twice removed from his folk singer in A Mighty Wind.Where The Break-Up really succeeds is in the quality of its writing. There's depth in character displayed here that goes beyond mere stereotype. Making Gary a lazy slob doesn't prejudice us against him, likewise with Brooke's occasional nagging; it's not a 'Battle of the Sexes' movie by any means, and it's superbly balanced so as not to force you to pick sides. There are real moments of recognition that hit home  a furious Brooke stands in her room unable to move out of sheer anger, and later lies in bed alone, eyes open intently as she listens to her boyfriend come home and pull out the couch  this is stuff that has clearly been written by people who have lived it and not just seen movies about it. If you're looking for another dumb frat pack movie, then you won't find it here, but that's not to say you won't have fun: watching an irate Vince Vaughn playing Pictionary is just as brilliant as you'd always hoped it would be.",The Break-Up
478,MissMademoiselle,watch this if you want to wallow,5,19 October 2006,"I thought this movie would be funnier than it was...I thought the point was made early on and dragged out a bit. But seriously, all this movie did was resurface feelings about my own recent break up. The movie was realistic and sad! Not a good thing when trying to forget and move on.... beware! I did enjoy watching Aniston and Vaughn interact and have a newfound love for Ivan Sergei. I felt that the cast was put together nicely, a lot of actors that have been around for awhile, it was nice to see them again. This movie reminds me of the one Uma Thurman was in when she dated the younger guy, that movie was just about breaking up and hurt as well.",The Break-Up

For me he doesn't suit the role of wannabe bad guy turned good as he tries at the end of this film.The plot is very thin indeed, couple get together, row, split up. Please, we deserve more for the undoubted ridiculous sums of money these actors get paid, and our £7 (or 10-12 if you're in London)....",The Break-Up
480,toni-106,Frustrating - Expected Romantic Comedy but got War of the Roses instead,4,3 June 2006,"Frustrating. No development of why the main characters like each other to begin with. This was a comedy but the movie made me sad. Particularly in light of the real life break-up of sweet Jennifer Aniston with Jolie-owned Pitt and what appears to be a parody of the real life trials and tribulations of Vince and Jen.Jennifer was beautiful. Vince was funny. Jason Bateman was funny.However, I just felt like I was watching one of my own relationship fights. Every game they played I've tested out and just relived my own true misery. So, I guess this was more of a drama than a comedy.I read Vince Vaughn had written the story, starred and produced it. Its impressive the Vaughn is so multi-dimensional. It seemed like he had the right idea but each character needed just a bit more development and perhaps better segways between action/re-action so it would be less like multiple independent sketches and more of a unified idea. I'd expected a fun romantic comedy and left feeling empty.",The Break-Up
481,jelly_bean_counter,"Romantic Comedy???...more like ""Romantic Horror""",2,24 October 2006,"C'mon Hollywood. Give me a break! This move was anything but comical. The humor was few and far between...and the end of the movie, my wife and I honestly felt sick to our stomach.I knew there would be some ""rough"" parts in the film (it IS called ""The Break-Up"")- but with the comedic elements being predictable, and the rough parts being over the top- I found myself more and more depressed as I watched this pitiful film.Sitting here, thinking of the movie I watched last night, the two things that I remember is Vince's constant use of profanity (over 12 God-Da*mn's) and Jennifer constantly attempting (in futility, I might add) to make her chest look like something it wasn't (and isn't).This move was one of the most childish and predictable movies I've ever seen. Sure, movies like ""She's the Man"" & ""Mean Girls"" are equally cheesy and childish...but they don't present themselves as being anything more than just that- a ""made for teens"" movie.""The Break-Up"" however, led me to expect something more. And it came up way short. As far as those viewers who argue this move is ""so realistic""- how many men out there have had an all-night sex orgy in the same house they shared with their ex? Or how many couples really would let their disagreements with their other half come out in such public settings it did in the movie? (i.e. the ""Game Night"" scene"") Oh, and on another note- the ""singing/karate kicking"" brother joke was totally lame.My one sentence take on ""The Break-Up"": The lack of romantic chemistry between Vince and Jennifer coupled with the over-the-top antics in which both protagonists try to ""get back"" at each other led me rooting for neither of them and praying to God not for reconciliation- but for ending credits.My take: 2/10",The Break-Up
482,satiricalcupcake,wait for the DVD,5,6 June 2006,"I expected more. The movie had a few cheap laughs, but nothing extraordinary. I can't even recall any truly funny moments now that I think about it. Jennifer Aniston was better on ""Friends"" and Vince Vaughn's performance, as much as I love him, seemed to show that he knew he was better than this crap. I'm not sure if it was just the cut that was mistakenly sent to our theater, but the boom was obviously showing in every single shot. The whole movie seemed mediocre and elementary. Was it the film maker's first film? Because it sure seemed like it. Sloppy errors and lazy shots further distracted me, not that the movie was any good anyway. Disappointing at best. And the ending was terrible and seemed to wrap up too quickly. I didn't think they would really end it the way they did until the credits started rolling and everyone walked out mumbling about how awful it was.",The Break-Up
483,sethrosson,Better Than Expected,7,2 June 2006,"This movie was not too bad. I went in with average ""romantic comedy"" expectations after seeing the trailer, and was pleasantly surprised with above average insight. I'm not saying this movie was in the same league as gone with the wind or something, but the script and overall direction were much better than I was expecting. It has some good laughs, and a few clichéd ones, but it's main achievement was with somewhat relative dialog and events. It goes further than the typical ""romantic comedy"" and puts things in perspective a bit without getting too ""heavy"". Anyhow, if you're looking for a movie with some decent laughs and a few bits of real perspective with not necessarily the same olé stuff you should check it out. If you're looking for a predictable no brainer, you could probably still watch this, but you wouldn't be as happy as having watched ""Rumor has it"" or some other crap movie like that.",The Break-Up
484,maroon-4,Not quite there....,6,15 June 2006,"I'll admit I had high expectations of this film. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. The film was average and although an interesting take on the typical Romance/Comedy it didn't quite work for me.Not a lot happened in this film and at times it was bland. The laughs were few and when they were they were not outright hilarious. This film seemed to skim the surface of the break up of the relationship. It didn't seem to quite know what it was. For me it didn't rightly show the depth of emotion of what can happen. Jenifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn were both good in the film. Vince's Character Gary was certainly flawed yet Aniston's did not appear to be, therefore it did not quite work. I felt the drama and the emotions could have been heightened, and there could have been more comedic moments.The ending was not what I was expecting and although ambiguous it didn't work, it was too much of a loose ending. This isn't a bad film but If you are looking for a Comedy/Romance this isn't it. I wouldn't recommend seeing it at the cinema, its more of a rental movie.",The Break-Up

The Break-Up has its share of laughs, but more important than that, it allows you to see another couple's relationship that may hit closer to home than you expect. You will be able to see the exaggeration of many things that every couple experiences throughout its ebbs and flows. You will leave with that feeling inside that you need to give your wife a hug and say, ""I appreciate you"".

I won't say anymore - no spoilers! I thought from some of the press I read that there might be some REALLY sad parts - but there weren't - just the type of scenes you would expect from a couple breaking up. This is a movie that couples will really relate to - everyone has been in the ups and downs and trying to figure out if you really want to stay together or not.

491,emmechadwick,Film Literature A1,7,16 May 2017,"""The Break up"" is a film that incorporates a real life situation into a film that is relatable and well rounded. This film produces a new look at relationships and the hardships that are bound to come between two people. The director interestingly takes a new, and innovative approach on this film by not making it a happy ending story, but in fact making it a sad ending where neither person in the couple regains what they truly want--each other. The director continuously reinforces the idea that couples aren't always happy and go through trials just like everyone else. By doing this, it makes the film a more relatable thing to watch for an older audience. Although this film is overall an enjoyable film to watch, I would not consider it classic or a very popular film. Though in it's time it may have been very popular amongst adults and teenagers, it's overall value has decreased with time. Many think this is due to the fact that the film is too generic with no real 'closure' at the end of the film. Others speculate that it's just another relationship movie. I believe this film decreased in popularity due to both of these reasons. It attracts many of the older audience to this film, but once you've seen it, you've seen it and there's not much more to gain. Overall, I believe this film holds many morals and messages within it. All relationships have problems at one point or another and I believe this film explores those ideas fairly well. It teaches us that if you love someone, you sacrifice what you want to make the other person happy. It's also equally important that both partners are emotionally satisfied in the relationship in order for it to work out in the end for both parties. The director installations that in his film by getting a deeper look of the phases couples go through after a break up, which made the film stronger in the long run.The director in this film did a good job of showing the internal conflict of both the people in the relationship and how that affected the well being of the external conflict. By showing both sides of this relationship and how both people thought out their next move, it brought to light many of the questions people have in their own relationship. Brooke's internal conflict was feeling unappreciated in the relationship, and Gary's internal conflict was being confused and wanting freedom. Both of these problems contributed to the bridged external conflict, the break up and the aftermath it left on their friends and family. The director brought to light these two characters equally into the plot, which strengthened the audience's connection to both characters. This film explores relationships and the struggles one goes through very well. I would recommend this movie and give it a 7 on the wow scale.",The Break-Up

As others have pointed out, this is not a broad comedy. It is an extremely well-written movie meant for adults, not the 12-25 set. One reviewer called the characters unlikeable. Vince Vaughn (Gary) can make any character he plays likable and he does that here. (By the way, one reviewer writing about the roles he has played, left out one of his best, Return to Paradise.) And Aniston's character (Brooke) becomes more sympathetic as more is revealed about Gary.The friends of both characters act as wonderful foils here. We squirm along with them as Brooke and Gary fight and pull ever-more embarrassing acts of one-upsmanship. Watch for great comic turns by Jon Favreau, Vincent D'onofrio, John Michael Higgins and Jason Bateman. It speaks volumes for a movie when even the minor characters are well-cast. Even the driver of Gary's tour bus gets a laugh.I can't stress enough that this is a funny movie about human frailties. If you want phony sentimentality, go somewhere else.

Also, I occasionally like movies like this, but not this one. This movie was repetitive. It was just back and forth, the two characters trying to make each other jealous, and it just dragged.

Jason Bateman was in it for all of 5 seconds playing their Realtor. I thought it was pretty lame and could have been left on the cutting room floor. Joey Lauren Adams was OK as her friend who is married with 2 kids with a husband who had one line in the movie. Also kinda liked Jennifer's coworker and boss...kinda quirky, made me laugh.

That was just a minor part.

It somehow manages to drone on for a whopping 106 minutes. 106 minutes filled without any comedy, certainly no romance, and about a tonne and a half of excess, bad quality drama.You find yourself feeling unsympathetic towards the characters going through ""The Break-Up,"" having only known them for all of 2 minutes after having a quick glance through the old photo album. The tag line 'pick a side' means nothing, the answer clearly being 'I don't care.' The dialogue is too realistic, filled with mindless small talk and incessant whining in what I can only assume to be an attempt at humour. The singing scene can be described as mildly amusing but in reality, one scene is not enough to save a mind-numbingly boring film from spiralling into oblivion.It says it all in the title.

501,BritishGemini89,I loved it.,10,14 June 2006,"This movie is so true to real life. Girls do what Jennifer Aniston did, and guys react that way. Men don't understand women, thats facts of life. It's when the girl hurts them they realize and finally set themselves straight. I had a problem like this, I tried to do what Jennifer did and it didn't work. I ended up in more pain, cause even to this day, 9 months later I still love him. This movie hits home, and not just with woman! Men too. Men don't realize what they are doing wrong and I think this movie will help them see. I give it a 9 because it is one of the few movies with a real life story, no imaginary stuff, things that happen everyday, plot. One that hits home for a lot of women and some men too. It gets a ten in my book cause even the ending is realistic.",The Break-Up
502,samtopia,could have been so much better...,6,3 June 2006,"This movie is funny at times, at provided me some cheap laughs here and there, but where the movie's real genius relies is in its sense of reality. The best parts of the movie are where everyone is actually serious, and saying things that you might actually hear someone say in real life. But between these segments are parts where they keep throwing out Vince Vaughn humor, which is mildly entertaining, but the movie would be better without.The greatest part of the movie is the ending, which actually applies to real life. People don't always end up together, and there isn't always a happy ending. The movie delivers this aspect incredibly, and it's amazing that a Hollywood flick like this would have the guts to do that. But the movie never achieves the right balance between comedy and drama, and as such gets caught in the middle, with Vince getting his ass kicked by Jen's brother in one scene, and Vince giving Jen a heartfelt speech that is truly touching.If they had cut out most of the toilet jokes and sex gags, than this movie could have been a great realistic drama, but alas, it isn't, which is why i give it 6/10",The Break-Up
503,wichway1,No need to pay for what you can get in real life,3,5 June 2006,"I thought this movie was down right depressing. Other than the couple of funny parts that are shown in the previews, the rest of the movie consisted of nothing but arguments. For those of us that have been through bad break-ups, this hits close to home. There is nothing funny about it and this movie certainly didn't make it easier or lighten the mood. The movie has a good cast but they were not utilized to their potential. John Favreau is good for some comic relief but other than him there was nothing ""romantic"" or ""comedic"" about this film. I left the theater thinking i'd been through all that before and it was not entertaining to pay to watch some other couple (even if they were made up) go through the same thing.",The Break-Up
