0,MartinHafer,Enjoyable but certainly not subtle or for all audiences.,7,4 June 2013,"I agree with some of the other reviewers who say that ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" sure had the look of a John Waters film. Part of this, of course, is because Mink Stole (a regular in Waters films) is in this movie. But most is because of the film's extremely non-subtle and cartoony way of dealing with homosexuality and repression.The film is about a high school girl whose family decides (for totally insane reasons) that she's gay and they surprise her by sending her to a camp that vows to 'straighten her out'. Cathy Moriarty runs the place and uses a wide variety of insane techniques to change the kids' sexual orientations--with silly and predictable results.Some potential viewers would not surprisingly be put off by the pro-gay message--though I really think the people who made this film probably couldn't care less about these folks. However, some folks who would embrace the message might also be put off by the sexual tone of the film. While I strongly disagree with the MPAA's original decision to rate the film NC-17, it is still a film that earns an R rating and is not appropriate for all audiences. A good film--just a rather adult one. Subtle it ain't--enjoyable it is.",But I'm a Cheerleader
1,bkoganbing,"She Can't Be A Lesbian, She's A Cheerleader",8,10 December 2007,"Young Natasha Lyonne's parents, Bud Cort and Mink Stole, have noticed a disturbing tendency in their daughter. She has not been developing an interest in the opposite sex as a 'normal' teenage girl should even if she is a cheerleader, the most heterosexual of activities you would think. Anyway being the good Christians they are, Natasha's sent off to one of those reorientation centers so popular now among fundamentalist Christians, those who refuse to recognize such evil people as Freud and Kinsey and their work, and want to raise normal heterosexual kids.The place is called True Directions and it's run by this huckster of a woman played by Cathy Moriarty. She's the nurse Ratched of the Christian psychological group, she plays the part beautifully. She's assisted by RuPaul Charles out of drag who's a graduate of her center and son Eddie Cibrian, a really hunky sort who's a role model for the boys and a sex object for the girls.But I'm a Cheerleader doesn't quite have the production values of a studio film, but no regular studio would make something like this. It's a topic that needs to be addressed, the fraud of these ex-gay ministries.When I was a working person at New York State Crime Victims Board, I had a case from a rural part of upstate New York. It concerned a young teenage girl who came from a fundamentalist background like our protagonist here. She and the young wife of the youth pastor of the church she came from, discovered their true nature and fell in love and consummated their first sex at a Bible Conference.Of course when mom discovered what was going on by snooping through her daughter's computer, the young wife was arrested and given a slap on the wrist by the judge because he thought it was too much the case. Nevertheless the woman is now a registered sex offender.The young girl was put right into therapy and as long as I live, I will never forget the remark the therapist made on his report to us that the girl is refusing to cooperate in the therapy because she did not consider herself a victim. It's also why her lover got off as lightly as she did. That case is the reason I enjoyed this film so much and recommend it highly to audiences, especially young gay audiences.",But I'm a Cheerleader
2,SnoopyStyle,sincere but unfunny attempt at satire,5,19 August 2015,Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a high school cheerleader. She doesn't like kissing her boyfriend. Her family and friends stage an intervention. She is sent to True Directions where she gets treated for homosexuality by Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) and her supposed hetero son Rock.Director/writer Jamie Babbit is very sincere in this broad satire. She's trying a bit too hard for the comedy and it never really comes. I applaud the attempt but it's a failed attempt. Natasha Lyonne is great and so is Clea DuVall. It is very odd that a movie sympathetic to homosexuals would have so many gay stereotypical characters especially for the guys.,But I'm a Cheerleader
3,lee_eisenberg,you are you,9,10 June 2021,"In the 21st century, reports of so-called gay conversion therapy have come up a lot. That makes Jamie Babbitt's ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" all the more relevant. Natasha Lyonne plays a high school girl whose conservative parents suspect her of lesbianism and send her to gay conversion therapy.Mind you, this movie is a comedy. Part of the humor derives from the sheer tackiness of the conversion house. Everything is either pink or blue to emphasize the owner's insistence on gender stereotypes to ""cure"" homosexuality. But there's also the owner's son. Looking as manly as can be, he's a gay man's fantasy.I understand that some critics called this movie a clone of John Waters movies. There's that element, but the movie manages to be its own movie. It exposes the complete hypocrisy of these religious fundamentalists who act as if they're doing something holy when in reality, they're teaching people to hate themselves.It's not a masterpiece, but you're sure to enjoy it, not least because of Cathy Moriarty's performance as the tight-ass owner of the conversion house. Similar movies that I recommend are ""Boy Erased"" and ""The Miseducation of Cameron Post"" (there's also a musical called ""Pray the Gay Away"").",But I'm a Cheerleader
4,lastliberal,"Congratulations, liars! You know who you are and you know who you want. Ain't nothing' gonna change that, shite!",7,6 June 2008,"Focus on the Family is in Orlando this week with big billboards promoting conversion therapy for gays and lesbians. Despite research by the American Psychological Association and other mental-health organizations, they continue to demonize those born with a different sexual orientation.That is the thrust of this film, a comedy, which certainly gives plenty of laughs at those who run a center for ""repairing"" those who are different. I cannot imagine how they could have made the leaders of this group look more ridiculous. The parents portrayed are just plain ignorant. You can't blame them for falling for the canard that sexual orientation is something to be ""cured."" Underneath that story is the pain of the children that are forced into these centers by well-meaning parents. Megan (Natasha Lyonne of American Pie and Scary Movie) has no clue that she is a lesbian. The fact that she is a vegetarian and doesn't like the way her boyfriend kisses is enough for her parents. She is sent off to be cured without having a clue as to what she is to be cured of.Graham, played by Clea DuVall (""Carnivàle"", The Grudge, Girl, Interrupted), and Megan are attracted to each other. Graham has no doubts about who she is, but is repressing to please her parents. Love wins out in the end, however, in this campy comedy with a message.",But I'm a Cheerleader
5,StevePulaski,"A John Waters Film, Not by John Waters",8,3 July 2010,"Rating: 3/4 stars.Heres a movie that depicts a softcore John Waters like style. It's a brave movie, discussing the topic many feel either uncomfortable talking about or just is an awkward topic many don't understand. It's homosexuality. This movie is for homosexually, but many people in the film treat it as a cancer to a person. Its unnatural, unwanted, and not understanding in this world. My view on homosexuality is that people can be however they want. If you find someone you love that loves you back you're the luckiest person in the world. It doesn't matter the sex as long as you're happy with what you have. Period.Megan Bloomfield (Natasha Lyone) is considered gay by her family, friends, and classmates. She's a cheerleading captain, has a picture of Melissa Etheridge, she fantasizes about cheerleaders when kissing her boyfriend, and she is a vegetarian. Oh yeah, she's gay! Better get her looked at. Just by the mild things she is accused of you can tell being homosexual is really frowned upon in this world. Her parents ship her to Teen Directions, a place run by a strict leader, Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) and where they teach kids to stay in the closet and be the way ""God meant"".In Teen Directions, Megan meets Graham Eaton (Clea DuVall), a girl who comes from wealthy parents who threaten to disown her is she doesn't become straight. She refuses to change at the same time afraid to live a life as a lesbian without any trouble. So naturally, Megan and Graham become attached to each other and the rest can be picked out.This film is more about homosexuality, it too teaches gender roles of both male and female. In the four step program in the film, Step 2 is ""Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity"" where both sides take on tasks of being a male or female to try and focus on their job reminding them what their role is in life. Though this only makes Graham and Megan hang out and get more and more attached. So it just helps matter rather than solves.This movie is a hard one to explain because of the unusual plot and so much there needs to be said. I can go on for an hour to describe what morals and themes are found within But I'm a Cheerleader!, but some are major than others. I believe I covered the major points in this film and figure that I picked the key points of the film. All in all, it's a great movie, and Natasha Lyone plays a perfect protagonist, being not to bright, but kind hearted which is enough to expect out of the lead female role. Also, perfect musical soundtrack here as well. Excellent, catchy music that fits well to not only the tone, but the vibe and feel of the story as well. Just by the opening credit song (my favorite, April March's ""Chick Habit"") I knew it would be a great film.Starring: Natasha Lyonne, Cathy Moriarty, RuPaul, and Clea DuVall. Directed by: Jamie Babbit.",But I'm a Cheerleader
6,=G=,"A mildly entertaining quirky, campy lite comedy",5,4 October 2000,"""Cheerleader"" uses the sexual-orientation awakening of one young lesbian woman and her concurrent attempted reorientation in a silly center for gay rehab to make a satirical statement about mainstream misconceptions of homosexuality. The film offers an adequate cast of second tier actors, some funny moments, a Mary Poppinsish milieu, and a couple of incongruously serious lesbian love scenes to provide it's nominal entertainment value.",But I'm a Cheerleader
7,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - But I'm a Cheerleader (1999) 7.1/10,7,9 June 2021,"""Truly, Babbit's enormously funny satire has more leanings in lampooning the heteronormative insularity and the society's benighted mindset of judging by stereotypes than in laying it on thick to fight against homophobia. Rounding up a miscellany of sexually ambiguous prototypes (Jewish, Asian, Hispanic, Black, jock, sissy, goth and tomboy, Babbit has a bent for diversity way earlier than it becomes a norm), the story meanders through the therapy's five-step program, under the clutches of Mary Brown (Moriarty, the throaty-voiced schoolmarm in shocking pink) and her assistant, the ex-gay Mike (the one and only RuPaul, obliviously ogling the fine specimen of Eddie Cibrian), and its garish confection of pink and blue (denoting the gender dichotomy) is a pre-Candy Crush doozy. Just like Jenkins, Babbit's feminine disposition calls the shot here, and we are all grateful to that.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",But I'm a Cheerleader
8,sddavis63,Still Haven't Quite Figured This One Out,3,3 June 2002,"Megan (Natasha Lyonne) doesn't really like kissing her boyfriend and has a picture of a girl in a bikini in her school locker, and so is sent to a special ""school"" by her Christian parents where potential homosexuals are ""converted"" to heterosexuality. It's really quite a foolish little movie, full of gays and ex-gays and ex-ex-gays, and gays pretending to be ex-gays.Stereotypes abound (presumably they are deliberately exaggerated.) Gays and lesbians are really, really gay and lesbian, and Christians come across as ridiculous homophobic bigots. In the end, of course, (spoiler ahead!) we discover that being gay is perfectly normal and Graham (Clea DuVall) and Megan ride off together to live happily ever after.The thing comes across as propaganda of some kind, but propaganda generally makes someone look good. This definitely makes Christians look bad, but no one comes out of this turkey looking good. There were a few humorous scenes, but it really isn't worth the effort of watching this.3/10",But I'm a Cheerleader
9,thesar-2,"But, I'm More Than That",9,31 December 2013,"Wow. Who knew one of the greatest gay movies is actually a lesbian film?I absolutely loved, adored and admired this classic tale of forbidden love. It helps that I lived through this era and what the characters of But I'm a Cheerleader had to endure.You see, my parents were the same. While they didn't go as far as send me to Straight (Str8) Camp, they did encourage me to see psychiatric help with my ""choice"" of this lifestyle. Well, just like this movie's true moral, it didn't help.I am who I am as these people are. And I am not just proud of it because of what others tell me I should be. I am proud to know my true self.Enough about me. This movie was fantastic. Small, yet large. Deep, though light. Funny and bright. The acting was brilliant, the writing dead-on and the direction: perfection. It's a wonder this movie was set to receive an NC-17 just because it showed acceptance towards lesbians.Poor teenage, cheerleading Megan. She's given an intervention when her family suspects she's a lesbian and sent off to ""Str8 is Great"" camp. There she must learn the steps to becoming ""normal again."" Of course, in today's age (2013, soon to be 2014) this hopefully isn't as accepted, but back in 1999, parents just didn't know what to do when they weren't promised a married man/woman grandchild.Along the journey in this camp, Megan meets a whole lot of interesting and wonderful characters, each with depth and wonderful stories of their own. She must make the ""right choice,"" i.e. to be true to oneself.I haven't seen this movie in many years and back when I had, I had watched it many times. No matter the number of views, I love it each and every time. The music is fantastic – LOVE the soundtrack. The story, emotions, depth and direction superb. I love the lines, acting, script and all characters. All actors gave their 100% including a fantastic performance from Rupaul, Cathy Moriarty, Natasha Lyonne and definitely Clea DuVall.This is a classic fairy tale with more layers than 17 onions and more fun than most str8 love stories. I truly believe it can be loved and admired by most people, str8 or gay and lessons can be learned from both sides. Truly see this and know how to treat your children so they can become better people.* * * Final thoughts: Years and years later, I would sit in a movie theatre and hear the song: ""Chick Habit"" but only this time, it would be in the Grindhouse double feature and at the end of Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. While effective there, I will never remember or know that song by any other reference than: But I'm a Cheerleader.",But I'm a Cheerleader
10,Cineanalyst,I'm a Homonym,7,30 July 2021,"I've said it before and will again: I love a good movie based on a pun. The central premise of ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is playing with the two (or more) different definitions of a single word, to put the camp in its story of a conversion-therapy camp. It's quite a consistent commitment to exaggerated irony and gaudy bright colors. I prefer this to something that, pardon the phrasing (or not--I don't care), plays the subject of conversion therapy straight--""For the Bible Tells Me So"" (2007), ""The Miseducation of Cameron Post"" or ""Boy Erased"" (both 2018). The light humor helps the medicine of the message go down--especially so if you don't need any converting to the fact that conversion therapy is bunk. Nevertheless, hard to argue such a message wasn't needed when homophobia seems the plausible explanation for why something this non-explicit required cuts to a avoid an NC-17 rating.The camp also adds another layer of affectation to the reflexive notion of actors-playing-actors, as their homosexual characters pretend to convert to heterosexuality. There's a couple especially funny gags based on this. The first involves Natasha Lyonne's titular cheerleader ironically only being coaxed out of the closet by the intervention of her family and friends trying to turn her straight. The first paradoxical step here to attraction to the opposite sex being admitting, ""I'm a homosexual,"" as if it were Alcoholics Anonymous. The second and briefer bit involves the most seemingly stereotypical lesbian member of the camp, who in fact isn't a lesbian at all, but is forced by the camp to pretend she is. Hilarious that the only straight kid at the camp doesn't graduate it.The boys side of the camp is but a subplot here, but it's also amusing that drag queen RuPaul plays their ""ex-gay"" counselor Mike. Michelle Williams, on the other hand, still in her pre-acclaimed actress, ""Dawson's Creek"" days, is underused. ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" only stumbles a bit when it inevitably moves from playing everything as a joke to taking discrimination seriously, but it does about as well as may be expected in maintaining a light and sweet tone during this otherwise tonal shift.",But I'm a Cheerleader
11,Irishchatter,Such an awful movie!,1,1 February 2015,"You know I would've thought this movie should've taken into consideration that why on earth would they call this comedy, when innocent people like high school students go into a 'gay cure' camp? Like I know this film is meant to be fictional but really its giving of a taste of something thats meant to be less scary when its not. I couldn't imagine how it feels to be in that institution of complete lies of who the person is! Its ridiculous and just horrible!Right in the end, Kimberly is whisked off with Megan but I mean what about the rest of the poor kids?? Seriously that is shocking and disturbing. Don't watch this movie...",But I'm a Cheerleader
12,TheMovieDiorama,But I'm A Cheerleader attempts to cheer its way through gay themes but has as much fluff as a pom pom.,3,18 June 2018,"Suffice to say, this was not for me. My general dislike for B-movies has only grown stronger as I frequently watch grander titles. Regardless of the above, the all-round low quality really did not have me dancing with joy, it nearly had me sleeping with boredom. The parents of a cheerleader are concerned that their daughter is homosexual, so they send her to a conversion therapy camp in an attempt to revert her back to being heterosexual. An always intriguing premise which I have not seen put to film before, conversion therapy of any nature makes for a psychologically stimulating concept involving brainwashing that could create inner conflict for the characters. However, theoretical possibilities and end results are two very different events, some more problematic than others. This end result was routinely dull. A plot that never has any drive, it simply consists of a group of homosexuals performing tasks ranging from mending cars to slicing logs with an axe. Y'know, really straight tasks. It sacrificed character involvement for a quirky aesthetic style to which really hindered the story. A surprising lack of heart and emotion, where the forced relationship within a confined environment felt, well, forced. The acting was shoddy, particularly from Lyonne and DuVall who seemingly are the lead actors. Even RuPaul and Moriarty didn't feel right for the film, an underlying sense of uncomfortableness. The musical score extremely irritated me, as if I was playing 'The Sims'. Y'know that really annoying happy quirky music, except it really didn't fit in at all for this film. The ending, due to minimal characterisation, had no emotional punch and came across as a predictable bore. This is simply best described as a ""made for TV"" film. The type of forgettable poorly constructed production that acts as decent background noise, taking an interesting concept and hardly utilising it to its full potential. Sorry, ""1. 2. 3. 4. But I'm A Cheerleader is an utter bore.""",But I'm a Cheerleader
13,jzappa,A Straightforwardly Satirical but Yawningly Conventional Romantic Comedy,6,2 February 2009,"We are introduced to Megan, played by the insatiably sexy Natasha Lyonne, a high school cheerleader who is dating football player boyfriend Jared. The first few minutes of the film are very visually juicy, as without any dialogue we come to quickly understand that she does not enjoy kissing her boyfriend, and prefers looking up the skirts of her cheerleading squad. Her family and friends suspect that she's a lesbian, and with the help of an ""ex-gay"" played by RuPaul, surprise her with an intervention. They send her to a puke-inducingly suburban reparative therapy camp, run by a terrible suburban witch played with great presence by Cathy Moriarty, which employs a five-step program to ""cure"" its reluctant campers of their gayness.This straightforwardly satirical but yawningly conventional romantic comedy is not only about sexuality, but also gender and the crassly propagandized pigeonholing of gender roles. But director Jamie Babbit approaches the material with a sleepy variation of the style Jay Roach gave to the original Austin Powers film and leads it to a very weak and anti-climactic rushed ending.Despite its light-heartedly satirical approach, there is a peep of true empathy for those who are put through this psychological and emotional terror. Babbit being a lesbian herself, is, I assume, responsible for these occasional undercurrents, as the script itself is merely a lightweight and obvious satire. Babbit herself hardly transcends the plainness of the send- up. For example, one of the ways in which she emboldens the archaic phoniness of gender roles is by saturating her costumes and sets with bold blues and pinks. It's not a bad touch at all, but the satire could have done better with more subtlety.I disagree with critics who maintained that the categorized portrait of Middle America is over the heads of today's gay teenagers, as I feel the intention was to make a wise jab at the Conservative, 1950s-style ""American dream"" social dreg is a inferior, tasteless copy of an ideological mindset. The trite lifestyle the film's caricatured adults insensitively impose upon their kids is pretentious and commercially produced.I love the irony of only realizing you're gay once you're in an anti-gay institution. The way society laughs at this is how kids are sometimes only really confused once they are told they are. When critics of the film have claimed it fails to subvert gay stereotypes by perpetuating them in the effeminate boys in the camp, they are forgetting that the movie is a parody not only of the fanatical religious right but also of the gay community it persecutes. But though the film is misunderstood by some, these stereotypical flaming-queen caricatures do fall flat after awhile, much too two-dimensional.",But I'm a Cheerleader
14,Vartiainen,Ultimately a failure,1,1 December 2012,"I knew, walking into this film, that I probably wouldn't like it. There are some subjects, like pregnancy, war crimes, and yes, homosexuality that require a certain amount of skill to handle humorously. This movie lacks that subtlety, trying to do both a social satire and a homosexual parody at the same time. A good satire can most often be watched as a good parody as well if you don't concentrate on the hidden commentary. But intentional parody doesn't really work as a satire and it's a form of humour that you either love or hate. I belong to the latter group, and thus I don't really think that I belong to this film's target audience. It's too bright, too in your face, too exuberantly and stereotypically gay - and not in a fun way. You're painfully reminded that these people, especially the males, could never exists in real life. They're just too over the top, too stereotypical, too clueless about even the most basic of social norms.By far the worst is the rehabilitation center, though, which is painted in the most obnoxious shades of pink and baby blue. The whole process of trying to turn gays and lesbians into straight people by forcing them to adapt the most masculine and feminine roles imaginable is of course ludicrous, though from what I've gathered, not that far from reality, unfortunately. And I think that this over the topness will actually please the friends of parody as it is always treated with tongue in cheek and with certain amount of ""yeah, we're just kidding"". But every now and then the movie takes a turn for the worse and tries to point and mock through the use of satire. It tries to say ""this is wrong, don't do this"", but it feels like it's trying to force the message down our throats. Its message is a good one, don't get me wrong, but its delivery leaves much to be desired.That being said, there are some good things in this film. The acting is mainly rather bland, but the two main characters, Megan (Natasha Lyonne) and Graham (Clea DuVall), have some genuine chemistry between them and you're able to buy their romance. Add in some laughs, which are kind of forced, but laughs nonetheless, and you have a film that has some value as a guilty pleasure.And that pretty nicely sums up the film. It's not a good movie. It simultaneously mocks the gay people and then tries to tell its audience that it's okay to be one, which sends extremely mixed messages. But it is rather funny if its sense of humour tickles your fancy and the main romance is watchable. There are worse films in existence.",But I'm a Cheerleader
15,I_Ailurophile,"Terrifically funny, entertaining, and heartfelt",9,5 September 2021,"I've never seen a satire so overt as to call into question if it can still be called a satire. We're treated to abundant pastels in art direction - wardrobe, set design and decoration; over the top performances from all involved, leaning into exaggerated characterizations; and outrageous dialogue and narrative. 'But I'm a cheerleader' feels like a very oddball movie. Yet in wholly making fun of nonsensical conservative talking points and beliefs while touting themes especially impressive for when it was released - and even still, hitting some key emotional beats - color me a fan: this is a delight!Nearly every line of dialogue, character, and scene is filled with stereotypes that seem far too ridiculous to be real, but the great absurdity is that they mostly are. From far-fetched notions as to the ""roots"" or ""symptoms"" of homosexuality to the method suggested as a ""cure""; from the emphatic enforcement, or reinforcement, of outdated stereotypical gender roles, to the very idea of ""converting"" gays - 'Cheerleader' is movie that would be an outright parody if it weren't so realistic. That authenticity is reflected in the characters: ""ex-gay"" counselors who are clearly not straight; parents ready to disown kids who fail the program; young people who, despite going through the motions with high marks, are obviously not being true to themselves.Above all, protagonist Megan is a veritable beacon of genuineness: a very typical high school student who is so isolated in a landscape of cisheteronormativity that she has no concept that the thoughts she has about women aren't ""normal."" It's such a common (though certainly not universal) theme in the LGBTQ community - folks who, by happenstance of how or where they were raised, had no point of reference to be able to stake their individuality, let alone engage in meaningful introspection of who they are. I absolutely recognize myself in Megan, and I'm not alone in that.While the whole cast is great, Natasha Lyonne shines above all as hapless Megan. Lyonne perfectly embodies the cheerleader with all the naivete and innocent confusion she can muster, while also ensuring she has plenty of personality and a mind of her own. For all the outstanding writing built into the screenplay, and brought out in the direction and artistic touches on the sets, Lyonne carries much of the load herself with a performance at once jovial and invigorating, but also shouldering considerable nuance and range.The supporting cast is just as outstanding, inhabiting their roles with every ounce of caricatured ridiculousness. Yet I'm also especially pleased to see Clea DuVall here as Graham, a young woman with no illusions about who she is or what she wants, but also put up against the fence in the face of domineering, traitorous parents. If Megan represents one broad region of the spectrum, an exemplar of self discovery, then Graham is an example of a very different person who is filled with confidence and self-awareness, but has doubt and shame shoved upon them by others. DuVall, no stranger personally to these types of stories, gives a marvelous portrayal of Graham, realizing the outspoken teen's poise and every conflicting emotion with all the skill we recognized in such an award-winning star. And of course, not least of all as two very different characters, Lyonne and DuVall are excellent scene partners. In and of themselves and together, Megan and Graham highlight the great heart that is poured into the film, and each scene they're in make the whole all the better.Though readily apparent, it needs to be said - even as every passing moment is played up for laughs, content warnings abound for homophobia, transphobia, and the very backwards notion of ""therapy"" that underlies the feature. No doubt the subject matter broaches unwelcome familiar territory for many viewers, and the harm that ""gay conversion"" programs inflict cannot be overstated. Still, acknowledging the difficulty that the content may present - this movie is so much fun otherwise, pointedly mocking all manner of anti-queer prejudice and its manifestations, that the most unseemly elements are handily deflated in its wake.Not to belabor the point, but it's also worth noting that 'But I'm a cheerleader' was released in 1999. However one wishes to view the current state of LGBTQ rights, the 90s were a very different time, with gay characters mostly appearing as token stereotypes in sitcoms, if at all. Representation in media simply wasn't discussed, ""transgender"" as a term had scarcely entered the cultural lexicon, and centering a queer character or relationship in a story was reserved for niche markets. True, this feature hardly got broad mainstream treatment. But considering the timeframe in which it was made, and all the social progress that had yet to be made, 'Cheerleader' isn't just wonderfully entertaining, it's low-key defiant.Scenes are as wonderfully orchestrated before the camera as they are written. Parts are depicted with fantastic performances that match the vivid characterizations. The narrative as a whole is sharp, clever, and solid, telling a great, surprisingly impactful story even as it's geared for comedy. In every capacity, this is such a joy to watch. I anticipated a good time going in, but I wasn't prepared for just how much the cast, crew, and filmmakers would go all-out to make it the most fulfilling, rewarding, outlandish farce it could be. 'But I'm a cheerleader' has garnered more high regard in the years since it first ""came out,"" and I can only hope that deserved reputation continues to grow: This is a fabulous movie, well worth seeking out, that I highly recommend to all comers!",But I'm a Cheerleader

Mink Stole is in the movie so I guess John is represented indirectly, plus the color scheme and wardrobe would have gotten his approval. The movie was a dull and weak attempt at satire.  I do not fault the actors and in point of fact I like a diversified cast - you have Cathy Moriarty, a former Oscar nominee, RuPaul, who is in his own category in the entertainment field, young stars Lyonne and Duvall, Bud Cort, Eddie Cibrian and Richard Moll.

18,gizmomogwai,"Good-hearted, but not hilarious",6,3 November 2013,"But I'm a Cheerleader is a movie with an intriguing premise, a dissection of the total absurdity of the ex-gay movement and broader issues of the harsh face of religious fundamentalism. It's also the kind of movie bound to become a cult favourite. I say it's intriguing even though I'm a straight male. The comedy is about Megan, a cheerleader baffled when her family and ""friends"" spring an intervention on her, to address her suspected lesbianism. They have stupid reasons (she's a vegetarian), but it is true she's more interested in the female form than kissing her boyfriend- they're right. Megan is sent to camp designed to ""cure"" homosexuals, but falls in love with another girl, Graham.The movie, while cute and colourful with a lot of good points, isn't exactly hilarious as a comedy. There are a few snickers here and there, but nothing major. There's also not a lot of eroticism, in spite of being about lesbianism- that's not what this movie is for. Mainly, it's more of a message movie, espousing values of tolerance, honesty, and love. There's some refuting stereotypes, even though it was stereotypes that led to Megan's family correctly detecting she's gay. On a side note, this movie was also subjected to a ridiculous NC-17 rating, for a scene where Megan masturbates- but it's through her clothes, we see *nothing*. This came the same year American Pie (and its trailer) featured a teenage boy having sex with a pie. The double standard is appalling, evidence of either homophobia or a disgust with female pleasure. Ultimately, this movie fell victim to the old attitudes it's trying to address.",But I'm a Cheerleader
19,gbheron,Wasted Opportunity,3,14 November 2001,"Talk about a missed opportunity, ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is one of the biggest of the last few years. The send-up is perfect; a high-school cheerleader is obviously a lesbian. It's obvious to everyone around her (family, boyfriend, fellow classmates), but not to her; she's clueless. How can she be a lesbian? She is, as the title states, a cheerleader, and they're not lesbians. Family and friends conduct an intervention and send the hapless young lady to a coed gay-deprogramming camp. So far so good, the stage is set for some hard-punching satire. Unfortunately the director and screenwriters are not up to it. Instead they opt for ""Police Academy"" level potty humor, tired offensive stereotypes, terrible scripting, lousy directing..you name it, and it stinks. The film self-destructs after the first 20 minutes, and becomes an insulting waste of time.  Too bad.",But I'm a Cheerleader

It's EXACTLY the great kind of movie that everyone says they'd love to find-- it is original, inventive, joyful, funny, warm and loving. It is also meaningful, without any kind of message of heaviness. Nothing in it is ""p.c."" or otherwise someone else's value system imposed on the audience. The characters in it relate to real life. You find out right away that the theme involves gay kids, and pressure to conform. Ordinarily, I'd RUN from such a ""social issue"" topic. But this was delightfully funny, open-feeling, fresh. Odd to say all that, but that's how it felt.I'm not gay, nor do I share some of my university colleagues' obsession with political correctness. But as a person who tries to be a good neighbor, a good citizen, and a compassionate person, I am basically friendly to ""outgroups"" and folks who don't fit in with the mainstream. But I was a bit surprised at how inoffensive and fun this whole ""gay themed"" movie was, and how quickly and thoroughly I got into it. I loved it!!! It's a great movie.

Their bedroom is a riot of pink satin, ribbons and lace worthy of Mae West.The girls have to wear pink uniforms and do housework; the boys are in blue and have to learn to chop wood, work on cars and learn football. Watching RuPaul work on a car is worth the price of admission alone.Each of the kids has a 'root,' - the reason they became gay: ranging from `a traumatic bris' to `my mother got married in pants.'Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann, respectively) are priceless as two of the first clients of True Direction and are now self described ex-ex-gays. They rescue kids via the 'underground homo railroad' with the message `that no matter who you are, be yourself.'They are an absolute delight.The final 'graduation scene' which wraps up the film very nicely is a real gem - I didn't know they made lavender fatigues!There were some real standout performances - Dante Basco as Dolph and Clea DuVall as Graham deserve special recognition.Don't run out as soon as the credits start rolling: There is one last scene that seals this film with just the perfect touch.",But I'm a Cheerleader

28,Perception_de_Ambiguity,But I Want a Good Movie,4,26 February 2015,"A catholic teenage cheerleader is sent by her parents to a reform school for queers before she herself even realizes that she is one.Even if it is a broad comedy where everyone is gullible and has an IQ of 90 at best, it doesn't seem right that the vast majority of the jokes in a ""pro-gay"" film do little else but to confirm all the homosexual stereotypes. All the adults in the film are obsessed with the sexual orientation of the kids which is part of the satire, this is one thing, but the film itself seems equally obsessed with it all the time, including the many scenes that don't feature any adults. Everything the kids do seems to relate to their sexual orientation, not even for a minute are they shown being, you know, just human beings.But the bigger problem is that it is simply not a good or very fun movie. All the characters are incredibly inconsistent and you'll struggle to find anything clever in the plotting or in the humor which is kind of cute, inoffensive, and rarely particularly funny.It's also not believable for a minute. The reform school is lead by two ""teachers"" who don't have the least bit of authority. They rely on the teenagers' good-will to pay any attention to their rules and lessons or to even stay at the camp, and paying attention they sure do even when they don't even want to be ""healed"" (half the time the kids want to become straight, half the time they don't, it changes from scene to scene).In the end 'But I'm a Cheerleader' seems more like an excuse for the set designers, the costume designers and the makeup artists to go full camp. It's nowhere near impressive enough in those regards that one could actually call the film stylish, but along with the actors who have fun playing their stereotypes it's probably the main thing that keeps the film entertaining enough to be at least quite watchable.",But I'm a Cheerleader

I'd say that But, I'm a Cheerleader (BIAC, for short) could've probably been a somewhat amusing little film had the script not been such a inane mess right from the start.Personally, judging from what I saw, I'd say that neither the director nor the blasted screenwriters had the slightest understanding at all when it came to the many subtle nuances of homosexuality. I mean, these guys couldn't have possibly had the least bit of insight into the subject, otherwise BIAC would've surely been destined to become something of a certified cult movie classic, indeed.Megan Bloomfield, a cute, 17 year-old, high school cheerleader, is suspected (for the most preposterous reasons imaginable), by her less-than-enlightened parents, of being 100% lesbian. (Oh, my gosh!) You know, I really wonder how many level-headed parents out there go through this sort of ordeal, trying to determine whether the peculiar behaviour of their little brat indicates sexual deviance from the ""so-called"" norm? The method taken to get Megan ""normal"", and back onto the old straight and narrow again, was to promptly send her (thanks to dear old dad & mom) to a ridiculous ""reparative"" therapy camp aptly named True Directions.Run like a concentration camp by an outrageously strict disciplinary named Mary Brown, it's here that the students (otherwise referred to as homosexual misfits) are put onto a regimental 5 step-program (very similar to that of AA's) that's supposedly guaranteed to convert even the most hardened homo-slut into a perfectly wholesome, happy, little hetero-twinkie in no time flat.And from this point onwards BIAC was nothing but a moronic chant of - 2-4-6-8 - God is good.

True Directions seeks to straighten out these teens in a five step programme, making them normal. However, perhaps it's not that easy...But I'm A Cheerleader does rely on a few stereotypes in its narratives, but doesn't shy away from twisting those stereotypes for comedic effect. The concept that homosexuality can be driven out of people if they are made to conform to gender roles is shown in all the comedy that such ideas deserve.

45,oliver-123,"I wanted to like this, but ...",7,16 June 2007,"Many potential or actual spoilers below.I really wanted to like this, because I believe passionately in the message that it promotes (though not gay myself). I watched this twice on successive days, feeling disappointed after the first viewing (I had read the first page of reviews). Second time around, I could see more in it: some subtle touches (Mary planting the *plastic* flowers and finding one that wouldn't stay planted - very symbolic), and found the bits I laughed at (especially the males drooling over Rock, and the ludicrous ideas of proper masculine/feminine behaviour being presented) still funny.The acting was uniformly good. But whether the characters were entirely believable was another matter. In particular, Mary had evidently managed to get a son from somewhere, but if she was so big on heterosexuality, why did she not have at least a lover (and why did not some cheeky kid point this out)? Of course, there was at least one passage to suggest that she was a suppressed gay herself - and her ideas of masculine and feminine behaviour were so extraordinary that they would have seemed unnecessarily prescriptive even in the Fifties. There is another major inconsistency: if she is so insistent on 'proper' male-female roles, which seems to include the man being the one with the job, why is she running a business and not confining herself to the kitchen etc.?Graham's motivation was not wholly clear: was she simply desperate to please a notably unpleasant and manipulative father? And if Megan's parents love her so much, why are they, especially her mother, so fast to state that they will disown her completely if she cannot decide not to be a lesbian? And why are her friends so ready to turn her in, and take the line that her boyfriend's appallingly sloppy kissing should please her? It is my understanding (as a Brit) that poor kissing technique is frowned on in high school circles, and I can see why any girl would have disliked this! There was an element of parody that went so far that it stretched credulity to breaking point. Could anyone *really* believe that vegetarianism was a sign of homosexuality ... when probably at least half the massive population of India, for example, is vegetarian? Or that one's mother getting married in pants, or being born in France, was a *sufficient* ""root"" for homosexual behaviour? (Mind, American antagonism to France being what it is in some conservative quarters ...) Further, there is some reference to God and the religious importance of a heterosexual lifestyle, but my understanding is that this is a *major* part of the teaching pushed by these institutions that attempt to 'cure' homosexuals (and apparently of Mary's own motivation), so we should have heard a lot more about this Other elements of the presentation, such as the attempt to present a gay lifestyle as luridly self-destructive, to suggest that gays 'recruit' (and liberals promote this), have no friends, etc. sound truer to life.There was also a tendency to make use of the stereotypes that the message of the film surely deplores. So André the actor and dancer has to be a 'cissy' (indeed, all the gay boys are made to run away when the axehead flies off the handle), and Megan is the child of a more dominant mother, who will say things her somewhat ineffectual husband can't get out - until a final scene after the credits have begun.This is a reminder that one would like to have known more about the parents. E.g. why does Graham have a boy's name? Did her father really want a son? The film is quite short, but I think it could have been improved by adding a little to fill in this part of the background more and answer some of these questions. I am still ready to give it a mark of 7.",But I'm a Cheerleader

Steven Spielberg makes epic productions, and sometimes they're pretty good. BIAC is a small film, made on a smaller-than-epic budget, with a limited scope (to fit the budget, probably) and a limited cast of characters, and it didn't have much of a big-screen play. As a teenage humor/angst film, it's one of dozens and dozens, some perhaps better done. ""Coming of age"" doesn't really fit - and it too perhaps has been done better. As a biting satire of our culture's view of homosexuality, well that's been done before - and perhaps better. As a satire of our culture's view of anyone different, there have been others, but probably not many as well done as this.But as a scathing satire on our culture's more insidious, cruel, and hidden, penchant to educate, change, and purify those who are different (as we did to the American Indian children when we forbade them their own language, dress, hair styles, and names), there have been precious few movies as effective as ""But I'm a Cheerleader."" (SPOILER) No editorial emphasis was necessary for the simple scene when the young man was put into solitary exile in a doll house for getting caught kissing another boy.

But gradually the true basic strength of her character evolved. (SPOILER) In the end, her character proved stronger than her sardonic, worldly wise friend Graham, Cleo DuVall. So not only was this movie a pertinent and effective satire, on a dramatic level it was additionally an outstanding story of the evolution of a very complex and profound character.Kudos to the director, Jamie Babbit, and to the superb ensemble cast for bringing the story together - and especially to Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall for bringing life and value to two very likeable characters.",But I'm a Cheerleader

Natasha Lyonne, Cathy Moriarty, and RuPaul were very funny.The main problem I had with the movie is its lack of bite. This could have been a really wicked social satire about homosexuality and efforts to make gay people ""normal,"" and it started out that way, but by the time the film ends it never quite hits the mark. The script, direction, and general acting were all just weak enough to take whatever edge the story might have had away (this is especially true for the main character's fellow campers, who display marginal acting talent at best). The last act is downright generic, something one might find on the Oxygen network's Movie of the Week. By the end I felt the whole thing didn't quite reach its potential.I applaud the producers for making a film like this, although it would have been better if they had managed to take things to the next level. I gave the film 4 out of 10.",But I'm a Cheerleader
50,Bgb217,"Charming, funny, great, feel good film with a conscience.",10,25 June 2002,"I have to say that I simply loved But I'm A Cheerleader with Natasha Lyonne; it was funny, witty, made me feel good, was truthful, and had a brain all at the same time. I nice little gem that I saw the trailer for on HBO one night, while I was flipping, and decided to settle in for it. I got a very pleasing surprise, this is a very good movie. Two things though not exactly related to the movie: why isn't there a soundtrack (great music)? And why is it R? It really could've gotten away with a PG-13, but anyway I am so glad that this movie was made.The premise is totally believable, the popular girl who doesn't want to accept her homosexuality, so she just shelves it in the closet of her sub-consious, and is sent to the so-sad-that-places-like-this-really-exist ""rehabilitaion center"" True Directions. Now, while some of the characters may be based on stereotypes, they are not all, for example the one really feminine guy could be a stereotype-- but there are some gay people who actually act like that, most don't but some do. Also, I can't see why people would call this entire film a stereotype, the message at the core of this is be who you really are. The film was just hilarious, and most of the things in their I guess people can't get if they haven't been through the experience of growing up in a straight-is-the-only (bs) world. Just hilarious. And everyone is especially good in this movie, especially Natasha Lyonne, who has a TON of talent shown here, and Clea DuVall also.Finishing up, I really liked But I'm A Cheerleader, it's a charming, cute, funny, and realistic film about the lives of some teenagers who are forced to do things like this. It's just a great movie all around-- it's hysterical and it has a great, true message-- Always be yourself no matter who it is. A high recommend, but not if your the close minded type who is scared just by the premise.",But I'm a Cheerleader

52,gts-3,Satire yes. But what exactly does it satirize?,6,1 January 2001,"""But I´m a Cheerleader"" (great title by the way, that begs for a change, marketingwise) is a one-joke-movie and the joke must have looked a lot more persuasive on paper than it does on the screen. Basic idea is that parents are so scared of their offsprings homosexuality that they send them away to reform-camp, in order to heal and get straight again. Problem is that the picture isn´t out there to hurt or even trouble its audience. We´re with the young and sympathetic reformees from the word go and the parents as well as the reformers are dismal jerks we can all feel superior to. The movie preaches to the converted and that´s all the more sad as such ""reform institutions"" for young gays and lesbians seem to exist in real life in the United States. As much as I may subscribe to this movies intentions, its execution is far from daring.",But I'm a Cheerleader

If this was about straight kids it would be PG-13 borderline PG. The idea of conversion therapy is a lot for some people though, so people who are sensitive to that topic might want to stay away.

54,Autlan,This movie might change your life...,5,20 November 2008,"Digging this movie out of the bargain bucket was like prising the lid off a mottled honey jar only to find the finest, most succulent nectar inside. I rediscovered so many feelings I'd suppressed since I first experienced this, in the theatre. I did feel slightly guilty, watching this sort of picture with my partner; feeling my emotion blossom, much like it did back back in those less inhibited days. But, by the end of the movie I was certain sharing this experience was the most precious thing I could've done. The similarities to my own life experiences were painted high, for all to see. Feelings of nausea every time I had to watch two Heteroes kiss. Uneasiness around the male members of the cast. The delight I'd feel watching a group of cheerleaders bouncing around. Warm gooey feelings every time those beautiful young women celebrated their loveliness with a delicate on-screen embrace. The electricity of smooth, smooth, soft, wet kisses. It was too much. Still euphoric from seeing my life flash before my eyes in this dreamy fashion, I seized the moment and informed the wife that I might be a gay lesbian.I'd always dreaded telling her my dark secret, but I was amazed at how easy it was to come clean. I almost felt cheated by her light hearted laughter. Of relief, joy? Wait, did she think I was joking? I told her this face was serious. She only laughed harder. Far more serious than the poker face I might wear on a Friday night to fool the guys into thinking I was one of them. She was near hysterics. Only one course of action could remedy this situation. She was starting to upset me. Just a little. I felt strong and emboldened as I wobbled over to the window, heaved it open, took a fresh breath and aired my secret to the neighbours, ""I'M a LESBIAN! AND I'M PROUD!"" There were some adjustments at first, but I can honestly say our relationship is stronger than ever. There's a lot more to being a lesbian than I ever dreamt. It may seem silly, but I can NOT recommend this movie enough. You might be living a lie without even knowing it.",But I'm a Cheerleader
55,blkmgcbhl,Satirical and heartfelt,9,21 September 2013,"But I'm A Cheerleader is a satire on a common notion that people seem to have about homosexuality being a disease of some sort. This movie is about the futile and hilarious attempts made at curing a bunch of teenage boys and girls from this 'malady'. I was surprised to see that this film wasn't rated above 7 on IMDb. Regardless, I couldn't find anything wrong with this film - the direction is good, the cast is a brilliant ensemble and the pivotal love story in this film and chemistry between the lesbian duo is sparkling. Short, crisp and entertaining, I know I can watch this film several times over and over again. Really glad to have found this slightly obscure film. It's also important to note that this film has a brilliant soundtrack; mostly a mix of 90s indie and pop.",But I'm a Cheerleader
56,LeJoe,Gay Fluff with a Few Chuckles at Best,6,2 August 2000,"But I'm a Cheerleader has a promising, clever premise but ends up as little more than a series of mildly amusing gags. Hopefully, most who view this film will have enough personal knowledge of gay men and women to chuckle at the stereotypical characters, while acknowledging their limitations as representatives of the gay community. Essentially, the film is a satire on conversion therapy, an alternative to being gay by which one is ""converted"" to heterosexuality. Not a bad premise for a satire, but in this instance, one that doesn't quite work. The subject matter is reduced to a series of silly gags that aren't outrageous or entertaining enough to make you belly laugh or overlook the total absurdity of it all. The cast is first rate and they do the best they can with the material. It's especially nice to see Mink Stole in a non-John Waters film, although ironically, he might have been able to do a better job at the helm. Another observation surfaced as I thought about the film later: perhaps it's time for a serious film about the pitfalls of conversion therapy. It's actually no laughing matter and a dubious treatment for a lifestyle that clinicians do not consider an illness.",But I'm a Cheerleader
57,big-gun,You Can't Not Be Touched By This Movie.,10,17 January 2017,"I'm usually not a person who goes for romantic comedy or romantic drama for that matter. There have been a few exceptions over the years. This was one of them.One evening I was channel flipping and came across But I'm a Cheerleader on the Indie Channel. What the hell, there wasn't much else on so I decided to watch. Natasha Lyonne plays Megan, all-American cheerleader and all around good girl. John Waters fans, Mink Stole plays her mother. Bud Cort (Harold and Maude) plays her father. Suspecting Megan is gay, they stage an intervention with her friends and Mike from True Directions, played hilariously by RuPaul not in drag.The True Directions campus is every stereotype you could imagine. Pink for the girls, blue for the boys among other things. Here, Megan meets Graham (the amazing Clea DuVall) and begins her journey through sexual re-identification or whatever you want to call it. Other faces you may recognize, Cathy Moriarty (Raging Bull), Melanie Lynskey (Rose from Two and a Half Men), Eddie Cibrian (who plays one of the gayest characters in the movie), and Richard Moll (Bull from Night Court).All around, I found this movie campy, silly, funny, touching, a little of everything. When, in spite of the best (or worst) attempts to turn her around, Megan embraces and owns who she is and professes her love for Graham, I was left utterly raw. But in a good way. Three subsequent times I watched the movie and felt the same way. If this movie doesn't touch, you have no heart.

58,Citymars,Further Proof That Gay Audiences Will Buy Anything,2,1 May 2003,"Someday, gay cinema will grow up.  In the meantime gay women and men are so hungry for representation, so starved to see themselves on the silver screen, that even junk like this is welcomed.Comparisons to John Waters' films are inevitable because ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is low budget, gay-friendly, and rife with poor acting.  The concept is indeed fertile: if any movement is ripe for skewering it's the ""convert-a-homosexual"" movement.  Unfortunately the execution is overstated and witless.  The targets have been satirized so often there is little bite left in rehashing the same simple stereotypes.  Making the ""straights"" so preposterously anachronistic further sanitizes the potential for humor. The fable is meant to be contemporary, but the well-meaning bad guys are right out of a 1950's nightmare of conformity that barely existed even in the 1950's.  All the girls in pink, all the boys in blue?  Well, if nothing else, it's easy to follow.Cathy Moriarty plays the founder of ""True Directions,"" but her lackluster performance seems more like your typical Mary Woronov star turn.  RuPaul was clearly cast with an eye towards irony (he is out of drag here), but his limitations as an actor overshadow the joke.  Other cast members have likewise been seen elsewhere to better advantage.  Only the two young romantic (female) leads are appealing, yet even when triumphant they remain inexplicably bland and one-dimensional.  It's one thing to show lead characters with the life sucked out of them by a conservative society, another to weigh down the film with their lifelessness.""But I'm a Cheerleader"" should have been hilarious.  It's too bad that the filmmakers approached the material with a kindergartener's point of view. The resulting film is so dull it gives ""camp"" a bad name.",But I'm a Cheerleader

And a few parts of it achieve the first two.But virtually all of the supporting characters are NOTHING but stereotypes. All gay men are effeminate, all effeminate men are gay, all lesbians are ... you get the idea. And while perhaps that can be partly excused due to the intended campy feel of the film, it was annoying.I was definitely very disappointed in the quality of the script. I had expected something similar to ""Saved!"" (which I love), but it's like the high school film class attempt at it.Even so it's a mildly amusing film that did redeem itself somewhat in the ending.

Clea DuVall and Natasha Lyonne are beautiful young women and pull their respective roles as main character and main antagonist off flawlessly.  There are scenes featuring somewhat-crude visual comedy and others with somewhat-objectionable homophobic dialogue.

I loved the performance by Natasha Lyonne as a naiveteenager coming to terms with who she really is. Clea DuVall was also great,even though we've seen her play the rich, spoiled, loner in her other movies. The whole plot of this movie was hilarious and took the controversy ofhomosexuality and poked fun at the stereotypes surrounding it. I've watched this movie 8 times so far and still laugh. The love scene between Graham andMegan was well done and could be tolerated by even the straightest person.

What forces Megan to attend this camp?  Well, she's a vegetarian, she hates kissing her boyfriend, and she has a poster of Melissa Etheridge in her room.  Oh No!  A gay intervention headed by RuPaul as his original male self is just the beginning of a programme to de-homosexualize Megan.At the headquarters of 'True Directions', Megan accompanies other homosexuals in search of heterosexuality.  But, Megan meets Graham (Clea DuVall) and there starts a homosexual relationship that probably wouldn't have happened if Megan had stayed at home.This movie is hilarious, witty, crude, and provides tons of social commentary towards the stupidity of homophobia.

If my various gay, lesbian, and bisexual friends aren't offended by it, then I'm certainly not going to be. This one isn't about consciousness-raising. It's about fun, and a little romance.(It's also about RuPaul dressed as a man, something that we don't see often, and I am assured many will find most appealing.)Don't see it if you are homophobic; or if you think that everything in the G&L film section needs to be PC; or if you are simply humor-impaired.

Natasha Lyonne, who I thought did a great job in ""Slums of Beverly Hills,"" makes the falling in love believable, but not the confusion she suffers at the beginning. (And her ""I'm a homosexual"" sobbing was some of the most fake crying I've ever seen.) Clea Duvall, on the other hand, did the bitter, sarcastic one who slowly opens up, but she did it very well.I couldn't tell what kind of movie this wanted to be... At times it was a farce, at times a drama... It just couldn't seem to make up its mind and stick to one genre. And for a movie that was supposed to be pro-gay, the gay males (except for that of ""handyman"" Rock) were painfully stereotypical (i.e., ""flaming"").

The plot and the hole movie are very cleverly set. The love story, in it, is very good. However, the biggest strength of the movie is the really unique, simple and enjoyable way it satyrizes and ironizes the goals and the methods of such kind of rehabilitation center. There are much more funny movies to see on the general subject (e.g. ""in and out"") but this is the only one I've seen which uses humor with irony, in light doses, more elegantly and hidden in the scenes and all this with a purpose to send a message through.

In case u didnt know, the movie's director is a lesbian, she's also the creator of TV's POPULAR. Anyway, u'll notice that the movie is remeniscent of Tim Burton's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and also of America's sterio typical depiction of suburbia(which is sometimes seen in television shows like DENNIS THE MENACE). The cinematography is so well-fitting because it is goofy. You see a lot of extreme camera angles. But the most memorable part of this film is the original music. I loved all of the songs so much. I've searched in several places for a soundtrack CD. But why isn't there one? Even dumb movies that nobody has ever heard of have soundtracks available in stores!

The campness of some of the gay boys had me in stitches, even after the first couple of viewings, and especially the repressed behaviour and longing glances of the son and the male warden. It is an ironic film but it does say a lot about society's view of homosexuality, not that I'm saying it's a particularly deep film because it's definately a comedy, and a very good one at that.

Mary (Cathy Moriarty) is the mother we all are glad we don't have and RuPaul as an ""ex gay"" is absolutely priceless.Often the best way to deliver a message is through the use of humour and I believe the delivery in this movie to be close to perfect.  The message of the movie is delivered in a way that is entirely non-preachy for which I am truly thankful.I would recommend showing this movie to everyone who is confused about their sexuality and everyone who discriminates against gays and lesbians.

The movie chronicles a group of LGBT teenagers sent to an ex-gay camp by their unacceptable parents. It's good for those struggling with their identity, or perhaps LGBT people just looking for a good laugh. I'm not sure if I can recommend this for the heterosexual community at large, mostly because I reiterate the comment about it being a little campy and at time it seems corny and more like a low-budget film if you're not interested in the subject matter. I found it a little awkward at times, especially with one sex scene of course. So a little corny and a little dorky, but overall the movie is feel-good, funny, and a great commentary for those of the LGBT community. I enjoyed it overall!",But I'm a Cheerleader

83,MoleMchenry,A different direction for gay films.,7,22 February 2010,"With RuPaul's Drag Race in full swing, I decided to give this gem a look see. In 2000, I saw 3 movies (But I'm a Cheerleader, Beautiful Thing and Get Real) about homos that told me that being a homo is cool and that not all homos are icky. This movie is one of the handfuls of gay movies that I find actually enjoyable (Brokeback Mountain not being one of them.) But I'm a Cheerleader follows teens as they are ""dehomosexualized"" at an Ex-gay camp. The 2 notable actors in this movie are RuPaul Charles (or just RuPaul if you're nasty) and Clea Duvall (well 3 if you want to count original Dreamlander and filth goddess Mink Stole.) Watching RuPaul play a semi-butch closeted ""ex gay"" was extremely hilarious. No one can do camp like Ms. Ru does camp. And this what this movie is, extremely campy. I love campy and over the top when it's done right. The thought of ""de-gaying"" these teens through various gender identifying role playing is great. The girls sleep in all pink rooms, wear all pink and handle objects in their simulations that are painted pink. While the boys fix blue cars, have blue guns, a blue ax and blue clothes.Our protagonist, Natasha Lyonne, is a good Catholic cheerleader who is sent away to this ex-gay camp because she eats tofu, doesn't liked being kissed by her sloppy kissing boyfriend, and hugs some of the other cheerleaders for too long. What makes this movie great is that it isn't one of those gay movies that shoves it down your throat or one that tries to show the reality of actual gays. What makes it great is that it doesn't take itself or gays that seriously while remaining serious at the same time. Make sense? It doesn't try to be preachy. It makes fun of gays and even more so, those who claim to be ex-gays.Cathey Moriarty (of Casper fame) runs the camp. It's her job to make sure that the teens are de-gayed and perform in the sex simulation at the end of camp. And, at the same time, trying to butch-up her son, CSI Miami's own Eddie Cibrian. But I'm a Cheerleader teaches gays to laugh at their sexually and those who oppose it. That no matter how many fake babies' diapers you change, how many logs you chomp chop, or how many people of the opposite sex you kiss you're gay, accept it. And that it's not something you need to get rid of just because you're super religious and right-winged parents don't think it's ""normal.""",But I'm a Cheerleader

I love the idea of the movie- a satire about 'homosexual rehabilitation' camps. However, the movie tried to be too much at once. It tried to be a campy fun movie, a satire, a drama, a social commentary, a romance story, and several other genres that I can't think of. Because it tried to achieve so much at once, it didn't really manage to accomplish any one thing very well. The plot was quite generic, and played way too heavily on the gay stereotypes. There were a few good laughs, but mostly just cheap jokes. The movie does have it's redeeming values- The acting was very good (for a campy movie). My favorite part was the love story between Megan and Grahm. There aren't very many lesbian romances that can be found in movies- especially not teen movies- and this one was very sweet and touching. This part of the story would have been even better if it wasn't juxtaposed on such a cheezy plot line. Oh well, it's still a fun movie.

The denials and trials of coming out in the face of caustic parental guidance form the theme of this movie; its barely masked underbelly questions what love really is.  When parents exile their children and then try to blame the break in the relationship on their gay children's choice instead of on their own, the strong children choose honesty--and in this case, a sweet love that make you want to leave the theater holding hands.",But I'm a Cheerleader

You know those comments made by girls under a true lesbian-love commentary where the girls say this scene/movie defines lesbianism. Well this movie, in my natural/perverted guy eyes sees this as what nature intended lesbianism to be portrayed. It doesn't fulfill the basic guy instinct as the typical hot lesbian scene that we all think of. Rather, it portrays what lesbians are and will always be, set aside from the cliché fake orgasm BS that is commonly seen in adult films. However, this film provides an enlightening truth plus a heartful awakening for those with an open mind. Great breakthrough movie even though it has a weak storyline.

The intervention where Megan's friends and family show evidence of her ""unnatural tendencies"" had me in stitches!There are moments when it tries to be more serious and I think those don't work as well. It's cute and quirky, and isn't really exploring new ground. It does drag a bit working up to the ending.One thing that puzzles me is the R rating.  I think it's sweet, kind of light and definitely teen appropriate.  I'm not even sure where the rating comes from - theme and swearing I guess.  There is a gay club with a raunchy name.

It's just that there was such potential for it to be more than what it ended up being.The acting and directing was good, although both could of used a bit more energy. If a filmmaker wants us to laugh along, they have to be in a good mood, and it's hard to tell exactly what mood people were in as they shot this.There are moments of genuine humor. The first half has some especially funny bits, but they're just bits, and they don't add up to a whole. The two major problems with the film seem to be the script, which is never fully realized, and the visual direction, especially from the Director of Photography.""But I'm A Cheerleader"" didn't focus in on what it was trying to say and exactly how it should be said. It seemed to want more scenes taking it deeper. We only get the surface of things, and this topic deserves an in depth treatment. There is greater potential for humor and drama, but it is given a tepid treatment.The production design is quite campy, but visually not much more than a one-note gag.

Admititly it is not without its drawbacks. Some of the scenes went to fast and we were not able to soak in the jokes. In some scenes the actors who payed the gay men did over act their roles a bit but i suppose they had to. Really needs two viewings to appreciate it more.

101,lizzyfang2002,"Fluffy, Funny, etc. *SPOILER ALERT*",4,26 August 2004,"Addressing issues of homosexuality is hardly the first thought that crosses one's mind when reading the title of this movie. While controversial, this movie speaks of a topic quite openly that was more or less taboo in 1999, at least to someone with a conservative background. Due to the rarity of the subject matter, this movie already peaks a certain interest in the open-minded movie-goer. The movie treats the topic of homosexuality lightly, with a comedic air. The audience can feel this aura from the overwhelming light and dancy colors that parade the screen. You will be amazed at how many everyday items can be found in bright pink and blue, from the house itself down to the last dishtowel. The background music also feels like it comes from a 50s TV sitcom, a prancy xylophone concert, which becomes irritating after playing non-stop for several minutes. All of these slight annoyances, however, really end up making you laugh at the entire situation to begin with.This movie is easy to follow, with little unaddressed, except for how Megan's parents appeared to have disowned her in two seconds when they were so open and understanding at the beginning of the movie, having watched videos about this ""disorder"" and leafed through many pamphlets from a man in a ""Straight is Great"" T-shirt. How they came to disown her so quickly was quite a mystery. It seems to be thrown out as a sudden battle Megan must fight, something to antagonize her just enough to romanticize her plight.Plot events are predictable. The girl that treats Megan with the most disdain in the beginning ends up becoming her girlfriend, a typical example of opposites attract. What is even more predictable is that any person who watches this movie knows that this True Directions boot camp is not going to do anything close to its objective except make attendees even more homosexual than they probably were in the beginning, especially Megan. The movie fluffs homosexuality to such a point that all these characters have almost no common sense or depth beyond their sexuality whatsoever. The brave, ""true-to-themselves"" bunch all run off at the end, happily ever after in a random, never-before-seen, pick-up truck that miraculously becomes decorated with hearts like a marriage getaway car. Megan's cheer at the end is cute, borderline cheesy, a must for a main character of a movie in which ""cheerleader"" appears in the title. Don't we all wish we could live in such a doll house world?Men who are looking for lesbian action in this movie will be disappointed. Overall, this movie serves its purpose to make light of a matter and make people laugh all at once. Being that it was funny and an interesting topic, versus having a plot line that began to melt into a growing puddle as the movie progressed, with shallow characters swimming about, I'd say this film deserves a 4/10.",But I'm a Cheerleader

Painfully slow, clumsy and utterly baffling in places, I don't know who this would appeal to, I cannot believe it won two awards, the only good bit is the opening soundtrack by Ru Paul (who also appears in this disaster).

All of her family and friends know she's gay but apparently she doesn't.So much for the setup. An interesting quirk to the beginning is that the friends and family use these superficial indications to determine that Negan is gay. At this point the writers have us guessing  a little. Is this going to be a movie about a straight girl who gets sent to gay rehab by mistake, based on a few stereotypical signs? Or is Megan really gay?It turns out to be the latter, and although the plot is somewhat predictable from that point on, the movie is very enjoyable and often touching. And believe me, Megan and Graham do end up touching a lot ;-)One of the funniest scenes for me was early on where Megan and her boyfriend are french kissing -- very badly. It's so clumsy, awkward and hilarious. It contrasts very well with the later scenes between Megan and Graham.There are some interesting tidbits left unexplored. For instance, RuPaul's reformed gay character, Mike, is seen obviously relapsing a little towards the end of the movie, but it's just left hanging, if you'll pardon my French.And what an awesome soundtrack.

First off, I love Clea DuVall, so I paraded to this movie opening weekend, even though I had no desire to see it, but in all honesty, it was really a lot better than I thought it would be. Cathy Moriarty was hilarious as the camp's mistress, and Natasha Lyonne plays a very witty and funny lesbian who is in denial of her sexuality. Even though the movie can be hokie at times, it was still worth the price of my movie ticket. Even the bar 'Cocksucker' rised a chuckle in my throat, and the poly-vinyl bright pink and blue costumes in the end of the film really gave it a great colorful edge, and a very fun style. The jokes were, even though politically incorrect and sick, incredibly raunchy and very amusing. It has a great screenplay, and the dialogue wasn't horrible at all. And in all truth, the acting was some of the most believeable I've seen in a long time, and you don't usually find good acting in films such as these. It can be a little raunchy at times, but it just adds to the flair of the film. All in all, this movie is a great date movie, and I can't wait to see what's on the DVD for it!

But it is a lot more than that. If you watch carefully, this is an incredibly honest, revealing and touchingly sensitive film on teenage identity crisis and identity search interacting with social influences. It tells you more than any psychology book could tell on adolescence, because one cannot put all that into words. Natasha Lyonne as 17 year old Megan (the heroine of the story) demonstrates amazing qualities of acting in a role which is probably the most demanding any actor or actress can face: that of a changing adolescent personality re-discovering one's inner, formerly suppressed unconscious self over two months, while still remaining herself in a way. If you compare her different faces at different phases of the story, e.g. when she ""just cannot think of anything"" at the camp, and when she looks into the bathroom mirror much later in the film washing her teeth, you will see what I mean. If you are not distracted by hilariously funny bits and jokes and you do not consider poor acting by Cathy Moriarty, it is in fact a top quality drama made superbly. Intimate conversations between the two leading actors (Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall) tell more in one minute of this film about life than most movie star celebrities do throughout their whole career. Natasha Lyonne should have received an Oscar for this as best actress, and she should have been offered leading roles in less superficial films than ""American Pie"". A talent wasted. Her performance in this film is an extraordinary achievement and a very touching experience for anyone sensitive enough to resonate to it.

But the writer and director were more interested in sending a message than in making a funny comedy. As a result, the film not only preached solely to the choir, thus losing any message it was intended to give, but was also not funny, and lost the rest of the audience.

I thought it was a great tongue-in-cheek way of saying ""okay, this is stupid, we need to let them be"" for the gay community.If you're in the mood for a lot of laughing, and RuPaul out-of-drag to boot, rent this one.",But I'm a Cheerleader
118,zmouse,best there is,8,29 April 2007,"*may contain a few spoilers*this movie is brilliant, especially considering its basically a coming out movie, what can i say in the genre that has been labelled 'gay films' there seems to be a definite lack of originality. its divided into two types; coming out and 'struggling relationship'both are always the same plot rehashed a million times, and being honest 'but I'm a cheerleader' is at its heart the same coming out movie plot.teen is confused. teen deals with trials of coming out as gay. teen lives happily ever after, (with boyfriend/girlfriend)but its not bad, in fact its good, very good. probably because it doesn't take itself too seriously. the main character is believable and likable, because of her naiveté. she is in fact the last person to realise shes a lesbian and throughout the bulk of the movie is never sure of who she is, blindly letting others decide for her. even after she left the rehabilitation camp she still asks people to ""teach her to be a lesbian"" to which her rescuers reply that she doesn't need to be taught how to be a set mold, just to be who she already is.the sets a brilliantly surreal, with the rehab camp done up like the nineteen 40's on pink and blue steroids. it highlights the ridiculousness of the camps attempts to force the children into highly outdated (and incredibly sexist) ideal of how men and women act, with lessons on how women should vacuum and men should chop wood.what crowns this movie is the brilliant ending, which (typical of Hollywood timing)climatically takes place at the rehab camps 'graduation' scene. you know shes going to get her one true love...or do you? yes this film actually makes you wonder if she really will get the girl at the end of it, with a dramatic tension at its hight. i wont ruin it for you, so don't worrythis film is touching heart warming, and it does more than other 'coming out' films is actually explore what it means to find your own identity in a sea of superimposed idea on how gay(and straight) people act, rather than just showing a carbon copy coming out storybest coming out movie ever!!!!!",But I'm a Cheerleader

125,ohclare,campy but in the best way possible,8,28 May 2021,"This film has been one of my favourites for a while; the colourful shots & costumes, fitting soundtrack, and remarkable characters, free of stereotypes, make for an extremely comforting, hilarious, and realistic depiction of queer stories. Unlike majority of the queer films in the 2010s, this film doesn't revolve around coming out, but rather focuses on a journey of self discovery and unapologetically embracing your true self. The only reason i wouldn't rate it a 10 is just because i found that the ending kind of fell flat and i would've liked a bigger climax but that's just personal preference; still a remarkable film.If you're considering watching this film & you want to know whether it's worth it, i recommend focusing on audience reviews rather than critics; it was the late 90s - society wasn't ready to see queer teenagers portrayed in a way that was normalized and not sexualized. Similarly, while this film is rated 18+, there is no nudity and limited swearing of any kind; it's perfectly fine for all ages. We can blame the time period for that unreasonable rating.",But I'm a Cheerleader

From the tongue in cheek references to gay and lesbian stereotypes to the sweet love story that developed as it went along, it's one of the best ""queer"" films I've seen in a while.  It pokes merciless fun at the idea that homosexuality can be defined, categorized, rehabilitated, or otherwise contained, and brings the lesson that being comfortable with yourself, in and outside of the context of your sexuality, is what's going to make you happy.And yet it does this without being obnoxious or boring.  Great appearances by RuPaul, Cathy Moriarty, and lots of other talent; Natasha Lyonne was excellent.  That girl's got a great ear for comedy.It was great.",But I'm a Cheerleader

130,cheywalksdogs,the most profound love story,9,1 August 2021,"I've had this movie on my radar for over a year, but just watched it this evening after going to pride. It's excellent, campy, upbeat, heartbreaking, and it's one of the most impressive commentaries on control and conformity I've ever seen.I am LGBT+ and I know what it's like to be cast out by family and friends who think their beliefs are more important than your basic rights and freedoms. I know the snuffing out of personality in order to make a nonconforming individual into someone under immense fear and gaslighting living a lie. But I'm a Cheerleader showcases the horrible detriments of being controlled into something processable in under two hours. The characters are seen having their own battles trying to choose to rebel or to be complacent under the threat of everything they have to be ripped from them, something many LGBT+ youth have had the ill fortune of knowing. But if you watch this film, you'll see what they choose.I watched this movie a couple days after becoming homeless from leaving an abusive situation. Also, in these couple days, I have felt the most light and compassion and love I would never have the pleasure to know if I hadn't chosen my wellbeing. I've chosen to be myself again.And good grief, it's hard. But it's a love story to yourself. It's not your expectations. It's so much more.This is a beautiful movie with a beautiful, dynamic story and I'm so glad I watched it when I did. I would recommend it to anyone.",But I'm a Cheerleader

I've watched this movie at two gatherings of friends -- one gathering was with my high school's Gay Straight Alliance, so it was a group of gays and friends of gays. The second gathering was mostly straight friends and two gay/bi friends. The first gathering was the best setting. Everyone was laughing and enjoying the movie. A lot of us had been through the same things as the characters. It was just FUNNY and heck, any straight guy likes watching chicks make out. The second gathering wasn't as worthwhile. Almost everyone was complaining about it and calling it trash -- BEFORE WE EVEN PUT IN THE TAPE. How immature and just.. homophobic... We weren't forcing them. I find this movie very funny. I recommend it to anyone either gay or a supporter of homosexuality, so you'll at least be comfortable with the setup. It's not a masterpiece, but it's fun to watch.

134,JavierMontes,preachy and unfunny,1,15 February 2005,"This is an incredibly unfunny film that is also extremely preachy. It takes a funny premise (a straight girl is sent to a camp for gays by her parents and friends who suspect that she's gay, even though she denies it) and then destroys that funny premise by making her discover that she really is gay. It then becomes tedious to watch.The performances are over the top, and it was made on the cheap, as evidenced by the low budget sets. But the real fault is with the script. They could have written something funny, but instead opted to get on a soapbox. As a result, they were just preaching to the choir, because I'm sure the word of mouth destroyed this film's box office chances.",But I'm a Cheerleader
135,EnglishFox,"Cute, But Cheesy",6,18 February 2005,"I was bored, so I was looking through cable channels and I found this movie just as it was starting. I liked the title and I have no real prejudice against homosexuality, so I watched it. It was cute, very cute. I loved the scenes where the girls were doing their ""exercises"", particularly the one during which Graham chose to make paper dolls instead of doing the exercise. I also liked Clayton, I felt bad when he got locked in that little house. He was pretty cute...wait, that's off-topic, sorry.But the ending was kind of...bad. I mean, Graham running off with...with...d***it. I can't remember her name. The one with the red hair, the star...jeez, I can't believe I can't remember the star's name, but I can remember Rock dancing to his headphones. That's pretty bad. Anyway, I couldn't believe that was the end. Who are they fooling? I hate it when so many stories end with ""I love you"" when that's not the end at all. Not to mention just the general running-away ending was pretty cheesy. Disappointing, after such a great start to the movie.The surface and the general meaning of the movie was cute, but it had a cheesy feel to it. It just...did. It wasn't...I don't know. Deep, I guess. It didn't have a real plot, once you got past I-still-can't-remember-her-name's first step. The heartbreak-and-getting-back-together at the end was something you could see a mile away, and there wasn't any suspense at all.In general, I only watched it because it had a good beginning and title (as I said before), and to see guys making out. Which is really weird because I'm a girl who likes pairing guys with guys and still thinks guys are hot. Heh...and if y'all knew my age, the older ones would be ranting about how corrupted the younger generation is these days. So true.6/10, I guess. I'll stop talking now.",But I'm a Cheerleader

I'm most definitely not homophobic and I am the most open minded person there is, and this movie was great. I loved the performance by Natasha Lyonne as a naive teenager coming to terms with who she really is. Clea DuVall was also great, even though we've seen her play the rich, spoiled, loner in her other movies. The whole plot of this movie was hilarious and took the controversy of homosexuality and poked fun at the stereotypes surrounding it. I've watched this movie 8 times so far and still laugh. The love scene between Graham and Megan was well done and could be tolerated by even the straightest person. I could really relate to this movie, which is why I was able to watch it over and over again. Nothing can stop true love - not even the lacking of a penis in a relationship.

But hey what do you expect from a bunch of 40 to 60yo, when this should be reviewed by 25 to 35yo.s I would have ratted this film somewhere between PG13, and R. Get real people, the stuff depicted in this film is actually much cleaner than anything you would see in a sex ed video in jr. high. Plus kids are much more aware of gays and lesbians in society than most people think, and they should be educated about same sex unions in the same class on opposite sex unions, it just makes sense. I would highly recommend this film to anyone. the frivolity of it all is very nice simple and straight forward. two thumbs way up.

I had to watch it by myself as my friends are quite close-minded on the whole homosexual issue. I, however think this movie was very tastefully done. It dealt with the sexual disorientation in an amusing way that truly showed the complete ludicrousness of trying to change a homosexual's sexual preference. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every actor's contributions to this movie and I can't think of a single character I would get rid of.

The sets are very cute and very, very fifties, as are the costumes. The costumes are fun in that they all match. You cannot be depressed watching this movie, everything is very technicolor and cheery, almost like a cartoon (I watched this when I had a cold and I felt better immediately). I personally think this doesn't deserve the r-rating, the sex is milder than what I see on buffy the vampire slayer, not very graphic at all, the most I saw being a hand on a navel and some pretty serious necking.

It's not blockbuster material but still it was good. I really liked the gay guys cause they were soooo gay that you'll never believe they can be ""cured"". And the colors in the movie were a great detail. The blue for guys and the pink for girls. But what wasn't clear to me was what the timeline the movie is in. Cause it looked like the sixties with all those colors and did you saw the outfits!! But I can't believe that in the sixties they were so open about sexuality (that were the seventies right?) The music they used in the film was also great they really helped with the movie. So sure there were mistakes in the movie but they weren't large mistakes and they weren't disrupting the movie.

The film plays on common stereotypes with ease and the performances of Lyonne and DaVuall are extremely powerful. The sex scenes are tastefully done and the messages are clear: You should be proud of who you are. The relationship between Megan and Gram are the basic of the movie. The music is corny but fits perfectly with the scenes. The sets are elaborate and use color creatively.

The idea of the movie isn't that bad but with this script and the terrible actors - the product was born to fail. I though at least they would have some models, or something like that, to save the movie, but I was wrong also there. OK, they put in some good jokes, but the movie wont survive only because of that. It's a movie for people in the age of 13, who still like to ""experiment on there bodies"" or joke about gay-people.I recommend you not to pay to see this movie.

I mean Rupaul, Ms. Dragqueen himself, playing a straight guy? That's funny! Overall, this movie is pretty good, although it looks more like an independent film than I would like, but oh well. Natasha Lyone, and Clea Duvall make excellent lead films, and the premise is pretty original too, however, in my opinion what makes this movie so great is simply Rupaul playing a straight guy.

She is a popular cheerleader, dating the captain of the football team. All seems well until she arrives home from school one day. Megan's family and friends confront her, and in classic Intervention fashion proceed to tell her what they KNOW to be the truth: That she is a repressed lesbian. She is sent into a ""Rehab"" program ran by ""Reformed"" gays and lesbians. What could possibly go wrong?I believe it is worth mentioning that this film has an early John Waters feel to it. Mink Stole, who has been in every John Waters movie beginning in 1966, plays the role of Megan's Mother Nancy.If campy humor and love catch your eye, check it out.
