0,TheLittleSongbird,Has every bit as big a heart as the titular character himself,8,22 January 2018,"Am a massive animation fan, have been from a very early age and as a young adult that has not changed a jot. In fact, love it even more and doing research on so many films, television and cartoons and the animation directing styles and techniques and behind the scenes has helped me appreciate it even more and be more knowledgeable on it.'Ferdinand' may not be among my favourite animated films ever or even of the year. It is still to me a very good film and worthy of more credit. It doesn't break any new ground and perhaps plays it a little too safe. Kate McKinnon at times overdoes it on the humour and the voice acting, meaning her character is not quite as funny, sometimes annoying even, as she could have been. She does have her moments though.There is so much to like about 'Ferdinand' though. It is full of charm and has a big heart, as much so as the effortlessly easy to relate to lead character. The other characters are every bit as fun and charming, and there is suitable tension and emotion in the conflict. The bullring elements are well done in capturing the dangers of it, really interesting to see it from a bull's point of view rather than the matador's or the audience. Despite the story not being much new, it is nevertheless lively in pacing and has a lot of warmth, fun and charm. The sincere message is a relatable one that's important and relevant, and it was handled with tact and not heavy-handedly. The writing may lack the complexity and perfect balance of comedy and drama as 'Coco' (as far as 2017 films go), but mostly is amusing and poignant.Animation is not as visually spectacular again as 'Coco' but is still full of rich colour and meticulous detail, in short it's great and makes for one of Blue Sky's better looking films. The music fits beautifully.Voice acting is strong, apart from a lack of subtlety on McKinnon's part. John Cena is the star here in a voice over full of warmth and personality.Overall, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Ferdinand
1,SnoopyStyle,enjoyable for the whole family,6,11 March 2018,"In Spain, Ferdinand is a young bull. He is eager to see his father off to the bullfight. He is dumbfounded when his father doesn't return and runs away from the ranch. He is adopted by young Nina and her father Juan. He is accepted by her dog Paco. He grows up to be a hulking peaceful bull. During a flower festival, Ferdinand is literally a bull in the china shop and he is taken back to the ranch where he is expected to fight.This is a Blue Sky - Fox production which also makes the Ice Age franchise. The animation is half a step below the best of the best. It's a nice looking cartoon. The animal designs are nice. The story is fine. The final bullfighting is excellent with some nice laughs. The bull in the china shop is perfect. I only have one big problem. Once Ferdinand is joined by Nina and Paco, he needs to stay connected with those characters somehow. Obviously, Nina can't be at the ranch but she could go on a search for him. Paco is basically an animal sidekick. He could have been a funny small bird or mouse who befriends him at the farm and joins him on the journey. Ferdinand needs a comedic animal sidekick. It's a classic cartoon trope and it's missing from this movie. There are missed opportunity in the writing. Nevertheless, this is enjoyable for the whole family.",Ferdinand
2,Horst_In_Translation,(not so) Raging Bull,4,7 January 2018,"""Ferdinand"" is a new American English-language film from 2017 directed by Brazilian Carlos Saldanha and just like his previous ""Rio"", the film is named after its male protagonist. Saldanha is also known for his work on the Ice Age franchise. But we talk(ed) about that one on another occasion. This one here runs for 105 minutes roughly and was written by a whole lot of writers which makes the very mediocre outcome even more disappointing. Talk about too many cooks spoiling the broth. Anyway, this is loosely based on the Oscar-winning Disney cartoon ""Ferdinand the Bull"" from 80 years ago or I shall say on the same book like that one. So it's perhaps a new trend and honestly it is about time some of these old classic cartoons get referenced again in today's movies. I wonder when we get fresh takes on ""The Ugly Duckling"" or ""Lambert the Sheepish Lion"". But I really hope these then will be better than this one here. Apart from the lengthy arena scene towards the end, I thought this was mostly a genuinely mediocre film to be honest. Quality moments like the bull in a china shop scene with the old female shopkeeper or the recurring references about the little bunny getting close to death were a rarity sadly. Too many characters and almost none of them got the elaboration they deserved- One example would be the hedgehogs, my favorite animals actually, but here really irrelevant. Or even worse: the horses who got a Sissi reference and Austrian accents here. In general, I cannot say I am too happy with the voice acting and dialogue writing, but perhaps that's just the German dub I watched that really wasn't any memorable whatsoever. I hope the English original was better.This is the last new theatrical release I watched before tonight's Golden Globes and fittingly this film is nominated twice with not much of a chance to win only once. The final half hour could have made for a great short film. As expected, men were eventually the enemy and not the horses, not the boastful bull and not anybody else. But even the bull fighter was all about pleasing the masses and becoming a legend, not about really wanting to kill or anything, even if he had done it. The turned-tables part at the end was kinda funny and the musical introduction to the arena battle was nice too. But in terms of emotions, this film can learn a lot from Pixar. The father's death early on was really rushed in and had almost zero significance sadly and the potential deaths to the butcher of two other bulls, Valiente and Guapo, were just as forgettable. And where were the bulls' mothers? Anyway, back to the arena fight as this one really offered the most. The scene when the bullfighter throws away the flower showing us that he has zero interest in nature and plants unlike Ferdinand was a really smart inclusion, maybe the best moment of the entire film. But these witty creative moments were far too rare for a pretty long animated movie in fact. All in all, it's more about hullaballoo and noise than about depth or great story-telling, so maybe a better watch for young audiences only. Of course the animation is pretty good, also the (title) character animation, but this alone is not enough anymore these days. Finally, a few words on the subject of bullfighting, which is really a controversial subject and you should not expect the film to make a powerful statement, even if the scene of the lost horns by the dead bulls comes pretty close already. It's just about the story, not about society or even politics. I have seen many better new animated films this year (from 2017 I mean) and I have to give this one a thumbs-down. Pity. I really expected a better oucome. Watch something else instead.",Ferdinand
3,kosmasp,Winning and other life goals,8,17 November 2020,"This may not be a Pixar movie, but it still is worth your time. It has some wisdoms of life, tells you it is ok to break out of structures while growing up and finding yourself and other positive (I would call them that) messages. Of course this also has jokes about incest and death - though both well ""hidden"" inside jokes. So something for the adults to enjoy snickering about and something I reckon kids wouldn't get in its entirety.Good animation, funny dialog and an interesting set of characters add to the overall fun you can have with this. The voice performances are also really fine. Story works for the little ones but also the big ones watching with them (or without - there's no judging who watches it, anybody can).",Ferdinand
4,jboothmillard,Ferdinand,7,17 February 2018,"I saw the trailer for this computer-animated movie a good number of times, I'm not sure if I was particularly interested or excited about seeing it, but it got positive reviews, and then of course it was nominated during Awards Season, so I went to see it, directed by Carlos Saldanha (Ice Age, Robots, Rio). Basically in Spain, a bull calf named Ferdinand (Colin H. Murphy) lives in a ranch called Casa Del Toro, owned by Moreno (Raúl Esparza), that trains bulls for bullfighting. Ferdinand is a gentle bull, with a non-confrontational attitude and a tendency to smell and protect flowers, for which he is ridiculed by fellow calves Bones (Nile Diaz), Guapo (Jet Jurgensmeyer), and Valiente (Jack Gore). After his father Raf (Jeremy Sisto) does not return after being picked for a bullfight, and a flower he was fond of is squashed, a saddened Ferdinand runs away from the ranch. He eventually winds up at a florist's farm, where he is found by Nina (Lily Day), daughter of farm owner Juan (Juanes), Ferdinand and Nina share a bond, including a love for flowers, so he is adopted into the family. Ferdinand (wrestler John Cena) grows into an enormous bull, but remains non-violent and flower-loving, but due to his size, he is left behind when Juan, Nina and the dog Paco (Jerrod Carmichael) go to Ronda for an annual flower festival. Ferdinand decides to go anyway, whilst walking through the village and admiring the flowers, he is stung by a bee, and the pain causes him to unintentionally wreak havoc around town, he is taken away back to Casa Del Toro, much to his and Nina's sadness. Arriving at the ranch, he finds that Bones (Anthony Anderson), Guapo (Peyton Manning), and Valiente (Bobby Cannavale) have also grown up and have been joined by a Scottish bull Angus (David Tennant) and a silent but intimidating bull Maquina (Tim Nordquist). Ferdinand is still disrespected by the bulls, but he befriends crazy goat Lupe (Kate McKinnon) who wants to be his coach in bullfighting despite his lack of interest, and three hedgehogs named Una (Gina Rodriguez), Dos (Daveed Diggs), and Cuatro (Gabriel Iglesias) who frequently try to steal food. One day, legendary but egotistical bullfighter El Primero (Miguel Ángel Silvestre) arrives at Casa del Toro to choose the biggest, strongest, and most aggressive bull to fight with before he retires. The bulls fail to impress him on the first try, Guapo is taken to a nearby slaughterhouse, Ferdinand is told by the other bulls this will be their fate if they are not chosen for a bullfight. Ferdinand does earn respect from the other bull, except Valiente, licking Angus's hair to return his vision, and in a dance-off against three German horses, but they still believe that fighting is the only way to live. Ferdinand convinces Lupe to join him as the hedgehogs help them to escape to return to Nina's farm, but when he is close to freedom, Ferdinand sees a picture of his father, and his horns are mounted on the wall, along with dozens of other horns, he realises that all bulls chosen to fight will be slain by the matador. Ferdinand tells the other bulls that they will be killed whether they fight or not, but Valiente is the only one unconvinced, he angrily charges Ferdinand outside, Ferdinand inadvertently beats Valiente in the fight, knocking off his right horn, Primero witnesses the scuffle, and chooses Ferdinand to fight. Valiente is taken to the slaughterhouse, so Ferdinand rallies the remaining bulls to escape, but first goes to the slaughterhouse to break Valiente out, there they discover Guapo also still alive, deadly contraptions are activated as they try to escape. Ferdinand, Guapo, the now-friendlier Valiente, Lupe, the hedgehogs and a red bunny escape the slaughterhouse stealing a company truck, Casa del Toro owner Moreno and his employees chase after them. The animals try desperately to lose the humans racing through Madrid, winding up at Atocha train station, the bulls take a small railroad cart to catch a train in hope of returning to Nina's farm, but Ferdinand sacrifices himself, so the others can escape. Ferdinand is captured and news of the upcoming fight between him and El Primero spreads, Nina finds out and with Juan and Paco they race to the Las Ventas bullfight arena. Despite Lupe urging him that he must fight to survive, Ferdinand gives a weak performance in the arena, Primero angrily tries to attack Ferdinand, he almost retaliates, but a flower reminds him that he is not a fighter, he lets the matador live. Regardless, Primero tries to slay him to finish the fight, Ferdinand resigns himself to it, but the crowd cry out for the bull to live, Primero submits to the petition by sparing Ferdinand and leaves with dignity. Ferdinand is reunited with Nina, who embraces him, and everyone throws carnations to the ring to praise the bull, the other bulls arrive to witness history, as Ferdinand is the first bull to survive a bullfight by being himself. In the end, Ferdinand returns home with Nina, Juan, and Paco, they are joined by the other bulls, the hedgehogs, the Bunny, and Lupe, who all move into the farm, and it turns out supposedly dead hedgehog Tres is alive. Also starring Flula Borg as Hans, Sally Phillips as Greta and Boris Kodjoe as Klaus. Cena is a great choice for the bull with a heart, and there is great support from McKinnon and Tennant, it is a simple story of a gentle giant who may have to go against his good nature to help his family and friends, it is based on an old tale, but made very modern, it is wonderful animation and will appeal to all ages, a charming animated comedy drama adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Animated and Best Original Song for ""Home"". Very good!",Ferdinand
5,oscaralbert,Disney must have purchased Fox for its Fair and Balanced approach to . . .,7,4 January 2018,". . . potentially explosive subject matter, as evidenced by the current Fox animated film, FERDINAND. This tale begins with the title character apparently squashing to death the world's last surviving bee. Scientist Albert Einstein famously noted that Mankind will go extinct within three years of the bees' demise, but FERDINAND's favorite flowers (and vegetables) continue to thrive totally UNPOLLINATED as the years pass while in this movie, since the honchos at Fox know that you cannot be Fair and Balanced by believing Einstein most of the time. Fox takes the same approach to The Holy Bible in FERDINAND. Lambs and lions flock together here, since heavenly dreams top the bitter and inconvenient truths of a Revelations-style Apocalypse any day. Fox shows just one bullfight during FERDINAND, which ends with the crowd wildly cheering for the bull. This comes off as extremely Fair and Balanced; probably at least half of such Spanish entertainments conclude with the bull emerging triumphant against the ""matadors."" The main lessons of FERDINAND: 1)Spain is an animal lover's paradise, and 2)Who needs bees?",Ferdinand
6,neil-476,Resoundingly average,7,2 May 2018,"Ferdinand is a flower-loving bull who has a gentle frame of mind and is disinclined to participate in bullfighting until a combination of circumstances has him ending up in the bullring.This CGI feature is based on a classic kids' book, and kids are its intended audience. It is well animated, efficiently (but not especially originally) designed, and has a decent enough combination of action, humour, character to pass the time amiably.The voice cast does well enough but no-one shines especially.This, to me, was a resounding average+ - the kids will enjoy it well enough with younger ones finding more in it than older ones. Parents might nod off.",Ferdinand
7,Hellmant,Not very memorable.,5,5 January 2018,"'FERDINAND': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A computer-animated family film about a gentle Spanish fighting bull that prefers non-violence to chasing matadors with red cloths. It's based on the 1936 children's book 'The Story of Ferdinand', by Munro Leaf and Robert Lawson. It was scripted by Robert L. Baird, Tim Federle, Brad Copeland, Rob Burch, David Kidd and Don Rhymer. Carlos Saldanha directed the movie (he's previously helmed such other computer-animated kids' flicks as 'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN', 'ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS', 'RIO' and 'RIO 2'). The voice cast includes John Cena, Kate McKinnon, Bobby Cannavale, Anthony Anderson, David Tennant and Peyton Manning. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also nominated for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song at the upcoming Golden Globes. I think it's a pretty standard/routine animated kids movie. The story is set in Spain, and it revolves around a peaceful bull named Ferdinand (Cena). Ferdinand prefers smelling (and protecting) flowers, to fighting. For this he is made an outcast by other bulls, and animals. Ferdinand is seen, by humans, as a great fighting bull though. So he's forced to decide whether he wants to remain who he truly is, or become the violent beast society wants to make him be.The movie is nicely animated, and the characters are well cast. Cena actually makes a decent leading man in the right role, and he shows a decent amount of charisma here (he's kind of similar to The Rock in that way). The story, of an outcast that doesn't want to be who society says he has to be, is one that many can relate to as well. The movie as a whole though, is just really routinely made, and not very memorable. Kids should like it though.",Ferdinand
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"This animation is predictable and a little clichéd, but the charming execution highlights its important and resonant central messages.",6,18 December 2017,"'Ferdinand (2017)' does do essentially the same thing in the same way as most other family fare, using its simple story as a way to convey its heartfelt and important central message to all members of its wide audience. Luckily, it also keeps close to the calibre of all but Pixar for most of its longer than usual runtime, while keeping its obvious yet strangely unexplored (for this audience) moral in keen focus. It's an enjoyable experience throughout, one that isn't marred by its absolute predictability or occasional silliness. The way it calmly pushes its peaceful overtones is deftly done, managing to hit me in all the right places even though I knew exactly what it was aiming for from the copious marketing and strangely notorious source novel. 6/10.",Ferdinand
9,ThomasDrufke,BULLy,5,19 December 2017,"There are plenty of animated films that follow the same sort of formula, make the kids laugh with silly humor but keep the adults entertained by throwing in a heartfelt message that resonates well with people of all ages. Ferdinand certainly tries to do just that with the story of an outsider just wanting to break the mold of being a tough fighter bull, but it also falls victim to the same sort of problems that most non-Disney/Pixar films do.It's always so easy to tell the difference between an animated film that is for all ages and one that is merely made for kids dragging their parents to the theater, and it has nothing to do with the animation style difference between studios. The real difference is in the humor and direction. Ferdinand is full of great voice talent from the improving John Cen, to Kate McKinnon, Daveed Diggs, or Gina Rodriguez. Heck it's even impressive in the look of Blue Sky's animation. However, I had a real issue with the use of that particular voice talent and animation that made the experience far from a worthy outing at the movies.When 98% of the humor is physical-slapstick cheap humor that has no substance or bearing on the actual story, then I constantly get the feeling there wasn't as much time or care put forth in the making of the film than there should be. Which in turn, can eliminate any emotion you did have attached with those particular characters in the first place if the film puts humor before heart.With that said, of course there are things to like about Ferdinand. There will always be place in Hollywood for stories about characters breaking the mold and doing something different, whether that be a human, animal, or even toy. Underneath all of the ridiculous humor, there is a nice arc for the character of Ferdinand and his various animal friends. To me though, the misplaced childish humor every few minutes interrupts any momentum for the real story to kick in.5.7/10",Ferdinand
10,ericstevenson,Watchable,7,14 October 2018,"This was by no means on the same level as something like Pixar, but still good. This movie tells the story of a bull named Ferdinand who runs away to a little girl's farm. He runs wild one day and finds up in the same place he was at the beginning. I knew that was David Tennant's voice! I'm getting used to watching the new ""DuckTales""! Lupe the goat steals the show. Seriously, this gets practically all of the movie's best lines. We get such great animation here. I admit it probably wasn't the most original of stories. I still found myself rooting for these characters. I love how there's a lot going on near the end. Of all the junk I've dealt with in Hurricane Michael, I'm glad to be reviewing again. ***",Ferdinand
11,John6Daniels,Underrated gem.,10,11 April 2020,Despite john Cena being the lead. This movie was an emotional fun and wild ride.Like I said it's an underrated gem.,Ferdinand
12,paulclaassen,One of the least interesting animated films I've seen.,3,8 June 2018,"Uhm, no. This was just cartoonish and silly. It certainly is aimed at a young demographic, as a mature audience will not find this funny. I didn't and in fact did not even find it a bit entertaining. Lupe the Goat was such a Dory (Finding Dory) wannabe, it was painfully annoying. It was predictable and bland with silly characters. That's it. Enough. I rest my case.",Ferdinand
13,briancham1994,Great message but so-so execution,5,31 May 2020,"This film approaches the issue of bullfighting in a very straightforward fashion. The main characters all aspire to be chosen and ""win"" the match, yet in a deconstruction of bravado, it shows how utterly futile and powerless their situation really is. It shows this in a way that is more comedic which helps to introduce the subject matter but also makes it too cutesy. It's a well-intentioned balance but I don't think it was expressed very well and the movie became quite typical and too optimistic.",Ferdinand
14,Rectangular_businessman,A cute film for kids,7,31 August 2020,I ended liking this more than I was expecting.The movie was fairly enjoyable and had a very nice animation. Personally I think this is the best movie Carlos Saldanha has ever directed.,Ferdinand
15,leonblackwood,Great fun for the whole family!,7,2 May 2018,"Review:
I thought that this was going to be a typical ""kiddie"" animation movie but it actually turned out to be quite joyful. I found the storyline quite amusing, and the animation looked great. The attention to detail was also impressive and the various characters all brought something fresh to the film. It is pretty far-fetched, from an adults point of view but with that aside, it was a enjoyable movie, with some heart warming moments. Anyway, the movie is about a bull, Ferdinand (voiced by John Cena), who is destined to become a fearless fighting bull but he escapes the Spanish bull-training camp, because he doesn't want to become a fighter. The flower loving bull hasn't got a bad bone in his body, and the whole thought of fighting is against his morals, so he becomes friends with a young girl, Nina, who finds him while he's on the run. Years later, Ferdinand has grown to an immense size, and when he goes to the local flower show, a bee stings him, which makes him go wild in the village. He is then captured and taken back to his old camp, were he is forced to train with his old friends, to become a bull fighter again, against his will. When he finds out that the bulls never win against the matadors, he tries to leave the camp again but this time he refuses to go anywhere without is friends. He manages to help his friends to escape from the camp but he is captured and forced to fight the matador, who what's to go out with a bang in his last bullfight. It's quite an emotional film, which really does have something for everybody, so it's worth a watch if you looking for a family day out. The dancing scenes cracked me up, especially the twerking bull, and you can tell that much thought was behind the scenery and the characters expressions. In all, I surprisingly enjoyed the film and I recommend it to people who want to watch a light-hearted comedy. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Carlos Saldanha, who also co-directed Ice Age, Robots, Ice Age 2, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and he directed Rio & Rio 2. Although there isn't plans for a sequel, I hope they bring back these funny characters because I would like to see how they progress in there new surroundings.Budget: $111million

16,matthewssilverhammer,2017 just wasn't a great year for animated or kids films.,5,11 March 2018,"The bull in a china shop section is great. Unfortunately, they've stretched out that decent Pixar short to over 90 minutes, and there's just not much left there. Animals behave like humans and do non-animal activities. That's basically the extent of the humor. Sure, it's heart is in the right place, but the ""be yourself"" message is a bit cliché for a kids film.",Ferdinand
17,stevendbeard,"Not Great, But Enjoyable",7,18 December 2017,"I saw ""Ferdinand"", starring the voices of John Cena-The Daddy's Home movies, The Marine; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016; Anthony Anderson-Black-ish_tv, Scream 4, Bobby Cannavale-Daddy's Home, Paul Blart:Mall Cop and Peyton Manning-In his major movie debut-he has been in Modern Family_tv but this is his first movie.
This is an animated movie that is based on a book by Munro Leaf & Robert Lawson about a bull that is peaceful. There was a Disney short film in 1938, too. John voices the title character, Ferdinand. He is a bull that is a pacifist. He hates violence and would much rather frolic in the fields and smell flowers. Of course, he ends up on a bull ranch that trains bulls for the bullfights. Anthony, Bobby and Peyton are fellow bulls. John escapes, meets a friendly family that adopts him but soon ends up back at the bull training camp, only to plot another escape. Kate voices a goat that is a trainer that gets the bulls into fighting shape. They have some adventures during the escapes-in cars, buses and trains as well as on foot-and they meet other fun loving animals. As the end credits start, there is a quick scene with the 3 hedgehogs-Una, Dos & Cuatro; don't ask about Tres-but nothing at the very end. It's not a great movie but it was alright and I think kids will enjoy it.
It's rated ""PG"" for some rude humor and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.
I don't think I would buy it for myself but I might buy it for my grandkids on DVD.",Ferdinand

19,bkrauser-81-311064,Fun if Forgetful,7,24 December 2017,"""The Story of Ferdinand"" is arguably one of the most cherished children's classics of the 20th century. The seemingly simple story of a bull that rather sniff flowers than fight, captured the imagination of nearly everyone when it was first released in 1936. At the time it was both celebrated and reviled the world over for being (in order of increasing ridiculousness): non-conformist, pro-peace, pacifist, democratic, Pro-religious, anti-democratic, communist, homosexual, anti-religious, fascist, anarchistic, anti-Spanish and in Ernest Hemingway's case being anti-faithful? That of course is the beauty of fable - stories so simple that what you get out of them is more a reflection of who you are than what the story claims to represent.Films however are different beasts. If they are to remain simple, the simple must come from the message not the plot, especially it seems when it comes to kid's movies. Thus Ferdinand, as directed by Blue Sky mainstay Carlos Saldanha, remains laser-focused on masculine identity and little else. Then to drag on the plot longer than the runtime of a Disney short, Ferdinand adds generational resentments, hastily thought-out prison break schemes, prancing horses, adorable talking hedgehogs, flower festivals, an extended car chase scene and I kid you not a bloody dance-off.All these changes aren't exactly a bad thing; at least not on their own. Much of the film's hijinks serve to pace the film and provide enough entertainment for kiddos without it necessarily coming across as filler. The characters while arch and broad never cease to entertain either. John Cena as Ferdinand beings with him a generosity of spirit that cannot be overstated and Kate McKinnon knock's it out of the park as Ferdinand's hand-picked comfort goat Lupe.It's just not Ferdinand; a fact that becomes apparent when he runs away as a calf in the first act and winds up on a farm tended by a benevolent farmer and his young daughter. It doesn't last and he's eventually sent back but now instead of pining for flowers that may never be, he's a bull who knows what lies beyond Casa del Toro and knows the grass indeed is greener on the other side. By this point the film becomes less of a fable and more of a specific sort of allegory - one in which he has to convince his peers that there's more to life than butting heads and being meat.Two problems with this - One: it's easy to change minds when you're the biggest bull in the ring. Two: the social change allegory forces the movie to be less about Ferdinand wanting to be accepted and more about what Ferdinand can bring to the table to facilitate such change. The onus is now on him. This would be fine from a character development standpoint but since said character is never treated as anything more than a symbol, there's really no room for any sort of growth. It's also a moot point as the powers that be aren't going to administer social change because one bull refuses to fight.So what was once a simple, heartfelt story told lovingly through countless generations has morphed into a so-so animated feature. Still, Ferdinand manages to inject a scintilla of the original warmth and gentleness from author Munro Leaf's original story; which will have to be enough since focusing on the films middling clutter is liable to leave you frustrated.",Ferdinand

21,valadas,Splendid,7,29 December 2017,"Splendid scenes indeed. The beautiful story of a strong bull with a great heart that establishes a deep friendly relationship with a young girl with her father´s suport. As usual in this kind of movies all the animal characters here have anthropomorphic expressions, talk and behaviour very well drawn, expressed and filmed. The bull at a certain time because of an accident it has involuntarily provoked is thought to be wild and violent and taken to a bullfighting business to be fought by a famous matador. Since this is much contrary to its nature it doesn't fulfill the needs of such a show and in a succession of simultaneously funny and dramatic scenes he turns the matador's job into a big failure with the final applause of the show beholders and his freed along with other animal fellows also captive and returns to the farm where he lived before with the girl and her father.

At one point there was even a dance off between the horses and the bulls, which although completely unoriginal, it was funny. There was also a joke involving 3 hedgehogs and Spanish numbers, which was also hilarious. The most creative (although overly extended) joke was a sketch literally involving a bull in a china shop. These as well as some of the action scenes that were impressive. As well as Cena, I thought there was a pretty good supporting voice cast which they did good.

I really enjoyed myself watching Ferdinand, whose appearance belies a gentle animal who loves to smell the flowers more than anything else. All the characters were cute and my favorite was Kate McKinnon's Lupe, the calming goat with attitude. Lupe outdo Shrek's Donkey at every turn as the best sidekick any animal could ever have. Extras on the DVD makes it worth watching over and over. Catch this movie!",Ferdinand
27,RforFilm,"Ferdinand delivers on it's pacifist morals, but is only a passable animated movie.",5,22 December 2017,"I'm sure a lot of people have heard the term of ""stopping to smell the roses"". It's a metaphor for seizing a moment in life to enjoy the more beautiful elements that are taken for granted. While some things could mean an entertaining movie or TV show, this is usually meant for something that we rarely pay attention to like a landscape, a sunset, or even the flowers in your backyard. The truth there couldn't be stronger as we often complain about the bad decisions and atrocities, and yet we probably hold back more then we should. There is a benefit to appreciating the little elements that do us a lot of good.The idea to ""stop and smell the roses"" is most associated with the children's book of Ferdinand the Bull, which was about the biggest and strongest bull that would rather smell flowers then fight. While I haven't read it, it sounds like a good moral (especially in today's icy society of politics and stress) that a lot of people really ought to take in. Like a lot of children's books, it should come as no surprise that a movie adaptation would be inevitable. So let's see if Ferdinand can make a modern movie transition. In Spain, a young calf escapes from a bullfighting training facility when his father is selected, but never comes back. Aside of escaping the tragedy, he's also running from the bullying he gets from his lack of interest in violence. He finds himself in a farm where he's taken care of by a florist Juan and his daughter Nina. Fully grown, the bull Ferdinand (played by John Cena) is a big animal, but is only focused on smelling the flowers and trying to make the other animals happy. When he get's stung by a bee and accidently causes mayhem at a flower festival, animal control seizes him and takes him back to the bullfighting facility he escaped from.He comes across calves now grown like Bones (played by Antony Anderson), Guapo (played by Peyton Manning), Angus (played by David Tennent) and Valiente (played by Bobby Cannavale) who all dream of being selected to bullfight. While Ferdinand does befriend an insane goat Lupe (played by Kate McKinnon), all he wants is to escape, especially after finding out that all bulls selected either never win bull fights or are sent to the chophouse.The story of Ferdinand seems to carry the same themes of enjoying the simpler things in life. It also seems that the writers wanted to incorporate an anti bullying element that's not a bad idea. Does it work? I think it does, but then again, I feel like that the story of an outsider within a society has been done several times in animated movies (The Lego Movie, Rio, Ice Age, countless DreamWorks films, etc...). If Ferdinand is going to stand out, it really needed to think outside the box. The problem I'm having is the movie feels at least ten years behind the curve. 
I think it simply falls on the story. A lot of the things they do are not bad ideas, but are things that I've seen done better in other animated movies; the goofy sidekicks, the big chase, the animals roaming in cities. Much of it isn't that original or even that funny. To it's credit, I don't think it's trying to be a major comedy, but rather tell a sweeter story. Because of that, the film retains a quieter and slower tone...for the most part (there's a pointless dance sequence and a use of the ""Macarena"" song that feel out of place). I appreciate it for more what it's trying to do when the final result.The one element that does help it is John Cena as Ferdinand. The pro wrestler is actually fitting in to his comedic elements a lot better then his earlier work. He does carry a charisma that makes his large personality an advantage for the pacifist bull. He even got a laugh out of me every now and then. Does it make up for the rest of the movie? I can't say this is a bad movie, but a merely passable animated film for families that are looking for something to watch. I'll give this five Ferdinand bulls out of ten. It's hard to get mad at a film that does accomplish it's goal, but I still think there's better ways to tell this story. Children should like it fine (I probably would have at eight as well), but adults will probably be board. I'd tell the family to watch Coco instead, but Ferdinand delivers on what it offers.",Ferdinand
28,fernandoschiavi,"A charming revisitation of a story that does not lose its beauty, as it has a lovely character who continues to smell the same flowers under that same cork oak",7,6 June 2021,"Compared to the original story 'The Story of Ferdinand', by American author Munro Leaf, right from the start, when we are introduced to a narrative that works more than just Ferdinand and his sweet way of looking at life. The universe of bullfights, from the animal's point of view, is built on the eyes of small calves and then deconstructed, indicating the film's nudges to such Spanish culture. On the premise, Ferdinand (John Cena) flees the ranch being created, destined to be a ferocious bull he never truly wanted to be, after realizing that his father would not return from the squad that sent him to a showdown. Finding a farm to call home, the calf grows in a place befitting its greatest desires for fullness and admiration. Growing up as a bull, an incident happens during a flower convention and Ferdinand is sent back to the ranch, having to face with horns and teeth a cruel system with animals, regardless of the path offered to them.After years of incursion at Fox animation studios, where he delivered several hits such as the Ice Age franchise and the two copies of Rio, filmmaker Carlos Saldanha decided to focus his attention on this classic of children's literature. The director has a perfect technique when it comes to the quality of his animations. The details of scenarios and characters have always been the main attractions of the films he directed or produced alongside other partners. However, the stories have never shown heights of originality or scripts so well constructed.Overall, the script has a good structure that takes the audience along on Ferdinand's new journey. With so many years of experience in the market and with a freer hand after several blockbusters, Saldanha not only tells a beautiful story of overcoming difficulties and a rite of passage, but also takes the opportunity to snipe at the mistreatment of animals. The main object of criticism, bullfights, is not chosen for nothing, as this is one of the greatest examples of cruelty to animals that exists until today. Although the adaptation is from a children's book, which needn't necessarily have any intention other than the usual storytelling, the script strives to bring interesting comparisons to the medium. The relationship between going to the arena and going to a slaughterhouse gains weight, whereas, surprisingly, the work ends up commenting on the consumption of animal meat, not in the destructive way made by Okja, but in a light way, not traumatizing, impactful just right for the kids watching the movie.One of the strongest aspects of the work, by the way, is the sense of collectivity he employs in history. While we had before a Ferdinand living his full individuality, without worrying about anything but his flowers, in this film the character seeks, with the help of his charisma that gradually conquers each of the bulls on the ranch, to make them their equals face the currents that men alienate them to follow. In Ferdinand, the message is that everyone can be whatever they want, and not be obliged - by the idea of either you live or you die, or any less extreme variation than that - to follow dated paradigms. One of the moments that works most in showing the connection that is being created between the animals on the ranch is the dance competition between them and the horses, these seconds that, despite not working at first (in which the comic vein of the film was still mismatched), get much funnier from this scene. Such a situation would have everything to present gratuitous playfulness, but it ends up overcoming this barrier, denoting a construction of honest bonds between the characters.If Spanish culture is well portrayed, the scene is also not far behind. Carlos Saldanha portrays a visually beautiful, cheerful and colorful Spain. The film's photography and color palette are vibrant and not to be desired. By the way, it is possible for the spectator to believe that he is watching a Spanish film, when the truth is that the film is American and directed by a Brazilian. The trace and animation left nothing to be desired from the big producers. Everything was beautiful, smooth and natural. The colors and textures were amazing. The characters are well characterized and distinguished from each other. And speaking of characters, the personalities and antics of all of them were very well worked. Each one with their quirks, jokes and stories. As much as some have shown up less than others, none of them you have that feeling of ""you don't need to be here"", you know?! They were all a delight to see on screen.Furthermore, just as there is talk about an ""improvement"" in the horses' functionality as mood relievers, the same can be said of Angus (David Tennant), who starts out extremely out of place and silly in the narrative (the kids will love it), until receives an unexpectedly good turn of the script, which yields as a result a very beautiful plan with him and Ferdinand admiring the horizon. Ferdinand is a lot of fun. However, during its duration, the feature film fails in many of its attempts to make fun.Although it has already been said that Ferdinand's personality is quite magnetic, it ends up causing a common problem in features that focus too much on a single role: all the other characters end up being relegated to the background, without adequate development or depth. The relationship between the bull and the goat Lupe (Kate McKinnon), as well as many other points in the story, only hits their final points. The character's addition to the plot sounds lazy because she doesn't try to bring anything substantial up front. When the ranch returns to the setting of the tale, Ferdinand's story takes a while to find rhythm and instigate the viewer to know what will happen. The goat would be the key for this not to happen, but it remains for a long time a supporting role indifferent to the bull's trajectory. A little different from Lupe, Valente (Bobby Cannavale) brings more vigor to the narrative, and one of the great moments of the work relates very well to what his character is in essence, which later suffers an interesting turn, despite predictable. A special addendum to The Machine (Tim Nordquist), the only comic relief in the film that works in its entirety. There isn't a single joke involving this character that won't wipe a smile off the viewer's face.As the film is not just a great comedy, Ferdinand's enmity with Valente also turns out to be a criticism of how parents can raise their children badly, as the second bull grows up with a closed and backward mentality. Saldanha shows all the points that led the animal to be like this. The scene in which there is an attempt to escape the slaughter clearly exposes, even behind the fun of the frantic sequence of action, the horrors these animals go through when they are transformed into meat for consumption. By the way, the humans in the movie are the only one-dimensional point. Nina (Ferdinand's kind partner beside his father) stands in opposition to the farm workers and El Primero, is the famous bullfighter who never missed an event and annihilates the animals in Madrid in front of the public. Although at the beginning of the film the bond between Ferdinand and Nina (Lily Day) is apparently well structured, it is impossible to buy the father's attitude in the face of the revelation that the family bull will be the protagonist of the farewell confrontation in El Primero. Man certainly knows the fate that awaits the bulls.Knowing that what ends up happening to Ferdinand - his victory - is, in the first place, highly improbable, taking his daughter to the arena is a bit sickening, as he's actually taking her to watch his performance. Best friend. A huge hole in the script, which exists only to create an extremely mushy moment between the bull and the girl, given the fact that the girl was simply forgotten in dramatic terms after Ferdinand's ""kidnapping"".Despite this inconstancy, the script is not afraid to be light and fun at various times, only to cause sadness and indignation soon afterwards when one of the bulls is taken to the slaughter. Even more so when he emphasizes that this violence is passed from generation to generation. The narrative flows freely through such extreme areas, without ever seeming forced, whether with out-of-time jokes or dramatic moments where some heavy and forcibly weeping soundtrack can disturb the spectator's feelings. On the contrary. The director's maturity makes him use these punctual moments as silently as possible, causing the audience to reflect.As the work moves towards the end, the plot manages to be better developed, culminating in a spectacular ending, endowed with a mixture of emotional grief and personal fulfillment, rarely worked so well in animations. However, the feeling that remains is that we need to hold out a lot until we reach the final climax, making the feature's rhythm problems clear again. At least the soundtrack composed by John Powell (""Han Solo: A Star Wars Story"") balances setback, with pleasant songs both in the most emotional spectrum and in the Spanish ambiance, where the whole story unfolds.Even with all these caveats, Ferdinand is a technically very beautiful animation, which finds its relevance in the social criticisms it makes, even if it doesn't work in the most focused and determined way. Despite this, and the mood of ups and downs, the viewer will definitely be watching a charming revisitation of a story that does not lose its beauty, as it has a lovely character who, decades later, still continues to smell the same flowers under that same cork oak. Unlike 1938, Ferdinand now still has great friends to accompany him in his contemplation of life.",Ferdinand
29,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Funny, Adorable, and Heartfelt, Ferdinand may not be a masterpiece, but it's big heart remains intact and makes it recommended to others",8,28 April 2018,"Ferdinand, in my honest opinion, is not only an underrated film of 2017 but it's in my top 5 best Blue Sky Studios films. Sure, the company isn't in the same league as Pixar and DreamWorks, but there are times when they're capable of creating some films that are worthwhile. This is one of them. Now, before I can give this film some praise, my only nitpick is that Lupe, the goat, Una, Dos and Cuatro, the three hedgehogs, and the three German horses Hans, Klaus, and Greta, which I will admit, are annoying. It's not the voice work. Kate McKinnon and the others did a fine job and there are some funny moments with those characters, but they're not as well-written as the protagonist himself. Like I said, it's my only nitpick with this movie. Everything else was good. The story may not break new ground, I'll admit, but what made it executed really well is the themes of patience and perseverance against violence and a lot of heart and emotion was put into the film. Also, Ferdinand is a very likeable protagonist not because of John Cena's superb voice work, but because he has a big heart and is very resistant to use violence which many people would find very relatable. The other bulls are interesting because of their connection and childhood with Ferdinand and the human characters including Nina are also interesting. The pacing is nice and takes it time to have some heartfelt and quiet moments (which I won't spoil to those who haven't seen the film yet) and the comedy's really funny too. The animation continues to be Blue Sky's greatest strength of all. The cartoon-y, but expressive character designs, the beautiful visuals, and the bullfighting sequences which are amazing to look at. The best part, however, would have to go to John Powell's soundtrack. His resume with animation scores is quite superb with his best work being the first two Kung Fu Panda films and the first two How To Train Your Dragon films (with the third film coming out next year) and his score here is also beautiful. The Mexican guitars, the emotion, tension, the comedy, and most of all, the atmosphere which he excels at greatly. Overall, Ferdinand isn't a masterpiece, I'll admit, but much like character himself, it's big heart remains intact. This deserves a recommendation to those who haven't seen it. Thumbs up. :)",Ferdinand
30,AhmedSpielberg99,At least it's better than The Boss Baby!,6,2 March 2018,"+ The anti-animal cruelty message represented very well from the perspective of the bulls and also merged very well with the message of individuality.
+ The animation is simple yet very beautiful, and the human characters' designs are really something special; every single human character design is different from the other and also very suitable for their Spanish nationality
+ John Cena did a great job voicing the titular character, I mean who could be better than him voicing a strong bull with a big heart?
+ ""Home"" is really a very good song and surprisingly moving!
+ The final bullfighting scene is very well directed.

The humor is really really bad in this movie and 99% of the joke didn't work for me.

35,estreet-eva,Cute but remarkable number of basic production issue,6,24 April 2018,"""Ferdinand"" tees up the standard anthropomorphized cartoon character as you've seen in a dozen other entertainments with the obligatory dance contests, butt jokes, pathos and chases (and hey, if ""Finding Dory's"" octopus can drive a truck, why can't a bull?) It does these thing as passably well as necessary to appeal to the minimal age of its target demographic. So no surprises there. What is interesting are the basic production issues. Most notably is the infamous scaling problem which normally plagues creature features. The titular character weighs in at 2,000 pounds and a length markedly exceeding the average bull according to the script yet he fits through doorways, in car seats, in narrow passageways and in a china shop (the writers kinda had to do that joke) with greater or less ease. Kate McKinnon plays the Dory / Mater / Olaf / Mike Wasowski wacky friend part with in the person of a truly unattractive goat. During some scenes the character rolls around balanced on a tire presumably because the animator figured out late in the process the bull / goal scaling difference was problematic. Beyond the production shortcomings, there's also the central issue of explaining to your non-Spaniard kids about the concept that people gather in large arenas to watch a heavily armed man on foot an several others on horseback kill a bull shoved into the ring for that purpose.

40,Ramascreen,Serviceable,4,13 December 2017,"The movie FERDINAND is serviceable, it definitely hits home for those of you who identify yourselves as a lover, not a fighter. Although the sidekick goat is absolutely annoying and there are parts in the middle of the film that drag and are just pointless especially the use of dance number as a way to forge friendship, FERDINAND means well and it will easily become PETA and animal rights groups' favorite movie of the year.Voiced by John Cena, Kate McKinnon, Gina Rodriguez, Davee Diggs, Gabriel Iglesias, Bobby Cannavale, David Tennant, Anthony Anderson and Flula Borg, the story is about this giant bull with a big heart. As a little calf, he escapes the fighting bull ranch and ends up growing up in nice farm owned by a lovable girl with her kind-hearted father. After being mistaken for a dangerous beast, Ferdinand gets captured, torn from his home and finds himself once again back in the old fighting bull ranch where he must form a team in order to escape, otherwise the choice is either die in the matador's arena or in the meat factory. I think my only problem with FERDINAND is that it plays it too safe, the characters, their personalities and how they bond for example, are very textbook. The story and its themes are nothing new really. When you've seen it addressed in a much grander way like the movie ""Okja,"" seeing it done like this, in FERDINAND just seems unimpressive. If this had been a short film focusing on the battle between the bull and the matador in the arena, I think audiences would be more entertained and they'd still get the whole ""Don't kill animals"" message. By the way, that scene is indeed the highlight of this movie because it does a switcheroo and turns Ferdinand the bull into the matador, it's a clever twist in my opinion. But still there are so many jokes in FERDINAND that just don't land, I'm a big fan of Kate McKinnon but her character, that goat is just annoying, there's nothing likable about her.But at the end of the day, I probably shouldn't bee too hard on FERDINAND. It's a movie that does what it's supposed to do. It's not a complete mess of a storytelling like those Nut Job movies. And WWE action star turned actor John Cena does a decent voice job. If you recalled, Dwayne Johnson also had his stint in the family comedy world back then with ""The Game Plan"" and ""Tooth Fairy,"" and so with ""Daddy's Home"" movies and FERDINAND, it's like a rite of passage for John Cena. Children will love this fighting bull who'd rather smell the roses than to throw a punch, in this day and age when aggression unfortunately seems to be the answer to every conflict, it is nice to have a character who believes that good can defeat evil just by way of simply being good. -- Rama's Screen --",Ferdinand

After I saw it, it was better than I expected, it was a bit mawkish but not to a large degree.The movie is more emotional than most Blue Sky movies are, it has quite a bit of touching and even sweet scenes.The plot itself is predictable and isn't much different from your average animated film, it's about misfits and a bull who gets taken away after having an accidental rampage in a flower festival and he tries to find his way home. The story makes for a bland, slow film at the start but it picks up pace around the middle of it. There are not many parts I remember laughing at, there were just a few that I found really funny but there was a lot of retching in it and if that counts as humor, I don't think it's funny, it's disgusting.Some of the characters are forgettable but I kind of liked Ferdinand the bull, he was kind of annoying as a shy child who couldn't fit in in the beginning of the film, but I liked how he grew into a compassionate and caring bull.Some may find this film cute.

When the film Ferdinand came out in the cinemas I didn't see it, but when I went to WHSMITH in May this year to see if it had come out on DVD and it was available I quickly bought the DVD because I love John Cena and Ferdinand was a really enjoyable film to watch and I really loved and enjoyed watching it and will watch it again as many times as I want because it is an excellent film. It really is a great film and it should have been given a higher rating of 10/10 rather than 6.7 out of 10.",Ferdinand

48,domtaylor,"'Ferdinand' is a fun family flick that explores some important themes, but ultimately succumbs to the generic story tropes that would be expected from a film of its kind.",6,18 December 2017,"Although the story is fairly generic and the jokes mostly fall flat, 'Ferdinand' is still a entertaining family flick that somewhat stands out from the majority of recent animated films thanks to the important themes explored throughout, and its subtle commentary of the bullfighting sport. The film does, however, include a few overlong action set-pieces that drag down the pacing and seem to have only been included to keep hyperactive children engaged (although that is indeed their purpose), but luckily the film doesn't rely on these and instead focusses on delivering its principal ideals. Furthermore, the third act is emotionally powerful and nicely wraps up the character arcs on display, while really hammering home its message. John Powell's music score is fantastic too. 6/10",Ferdinand
49,prafullasrivastav,Visual and musical delight for kids,6,16 December 2017,"Ice age famed Carlos Saldanha has come with another animated comedy on the eve of festival. John Cena did perfect job with his voice for bull who can choose love over hate. Each character has written very well specially lead role of Ferdinand and coach goat and multi talented hedgehogs. Some sequences were full entertainment e.g. Dancing challenge, chase sequence and slaughter house sequence.
Second half was more entertaining, engaging and full of laughter. Definitely visual and musical delight for kids.",Ferdinand
50,tmpsvita,Not so original but overall nice,6,10 March 2018,"If Disney-Pixar has set its latest film in Mexico, Blue Sky tries with Spain but the result is not the same.
The film, directed by Carlos Saldanha (""Rio"", ""Ice Age""), works very well in the first part thanks to a remarkable animation, excellent drawings and gags that amuse a lot and make the film attractive to different bands of age.
Unfortunately I noticed a substantial drop in the second part in which, although the animation itself is always excellent, the quality of the increasingly numerous gags and jokes is less fun, more childish and above all are more and more predictable, although some succeed to stand out.
The film, however, is still rather light and suitable for a smaller audience, thanks to a varied number of morals that, although banal and simplistically contextually, are always important for a certain age.
The sin lies in not having used a good opportunity to reflect, in an intelligent and appropriate way, on a problem now too neglected but always present in Spain, the Corrida; certainly the film tries every now and then to denounce something but it does so unconvincingly, Saldanha always seems to be held back and never goes to the end perhaps for fear of being too animalist or tied to some vegan philosophy. Too bad.
However, the dubbing is also excellent, especially that of John Cena who succeeds, with a lot of humor and charisma, to make the protagonist a worthy character.",Ferdinand
51,Animated_Antic,A funny and somewhat heartwarming tale.,8,19 December 2017,"""The Story of Ferdinand"" by Munro Leaf might be one of most well known children's stories written. The story is about a bull named Ferdinand who rather than fighting like the other bulls loves to smell the flowers under a tree and then accidentally finds himself in a bull fight. It was a simple story and I think it mostly translated well to the silver screen with Blue Sky Studios' newest animated release ""Ferdinand"". This film definitely has it's message stand out while also providing some pretty funny laughs. Here's why I think this movie works.The story of the film is essentially mostly the same with some more additions. In the country of Spain, a bull named Ferdinand (John Cena) is a bull who is more interested in smelling the flowers rather than fighting like other bulls. Living on a florist farm with a girl named Nina (Lily Day) and her father, he has lived a mostly calm life going to the towns nearby flower festival. One day when he visits the festival, he accidentally sits on a bee and gets stung causing him to accidentally destroy the festival. The authorities seeing him as a danger, send him away to the home for fighting bulls named Casa Del Toro. Though he is disrespected by the other bulls as the home, he quickly finds himself to a calming goat named Lupe (Kate McKinnon) and three hedgehogs name Una (Gina Rodriguez), Dos (Daveed Diggs), and Cuatro (Gabriel Iglesias). What happened to Tres you may ask? Well, they don't speak of him sadly. Meanwhile, a matador from Madrid (Miguel Ángel Silvestre) comes to the house to chose a bull to fight in the ring for one last time. The only problem is that if a bull doesn't get chosen, he is sent to a slaughter house nearby. So, what happens next? I'd rather not spoil the rest of the film so I'll move on to my analysis.Before I go into more detail about the film, I'll go ahead and say that isn't the first adaptation of the story. The book was adapted into a short cartoon by Walt Disney back in 1938 and ended up winning an Academy Award. Though that version is unsurprisingly the better adaption, this version of the story is actually a pretty good adaptation. The way I would describe it is comparing it to Blue Sky's own movie ""Horton Hears a Who!"". Where that film isn't good as the original Chuck Jones special, I still thought it was a good adaptation nonetheless and the same can be said with Ferdinand. What I was surprised by with this film is actually how funny it was. For the most part, the movie relies on classic cartoon humor you usually see in old Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, and Tex Avery cartoons most notably the scene where Ferdinand accidentally destroys the festival, including going into a china shop. Also Kate McKinnon as Lupe was pretty hilarious. In fact, this is an example of a comic relief that you think might be annoying working very well in the film. This is where I think the story succeeds the most. It's comedy is what makes the movie work. The animation is also great again. It's one of Blue Sky's best looking movie I've seen in a while with some pretty landscapes to go with it. The characters are also pretty memorable due to their good character designs and voices. I was in fact initially very nervous when wrestler John Cena was chosen to play Ferdinand because I seriously doubted whether or not he could act. Luckily, I found out that he wasn't that bad in the movie and actually sold the character very well. In fact, if you didn't know Cena was Ferdinand, you probably would have assumed it was some unknown voice actor. My only problem with the movie is that some elements of the movie will be dated very fast. I have always stated that it's better to be timeless than popular and where most of the humor will be timeless, some of it will get dated pretty quickly. For example, there was a scene where the bulls face a dance off between horses at Casa del Toro to some modern pop song and I remember scratching my head and thinking to myself ""What is the point of this?"". I can understand that the writers were clearly trying to write a scene where the bulls start to bond with Ferdinand, but it could have been written better and even in a more timeless manner. That was really about it though.""Ferdinand"" is actually a pretty funny movie with some pretty funny comedy, good animation, and very memorable characters which lead to a very enjoyable movie. It's easily a movie that continues Blue Sky's reputation that they're better at making original movies rather than sequels making up for their misfire last year known as """"Ice Age: Collision Course"". Hopefully, they'll take this movie as inspiration that people want to see more original content and not more sequels because if they do, I think they can become one of the best animation studios right now.P.S: As a note to Fox, stop releasing these movies on the same day a new Star Wars movie comes out. Your just going to lose money and besides, finding a parking spot on the night I saw this movie was a pain.",Ferdinand
52,Martinito_08183,I was shocked that I liked the movie.,6,4 July 2019,"I didn't expect to like the movie at all. It was a lot of fun, enjoyable and there were moments that i was laughing, which surprised me so much, but it doesn't mean the movie is flawless. There are problems that makes it distance itself from being a good movie and in my opinion it doesn't deserve the Academy Award nomination that it receive if i have to be honest. It felt too clichéd and things that were presented way better in live action and animated form by other famous studios. Even with it's problems, i would definitely see it again in the future and recommend it to everyone.",Ferdinand

54,Clank_Zoka,Not the Best from Blue Sky But Far Better Then Their Last Film They Released,7,26 December 2017,"For those who don't know, Blue Sky Is an animation company that make animated films mostly the Ice Age Films, despite being no Disney or Pixar, they do have effort in their films, like the animation is very impressive and they do execute their stories good, they may not be original but they do put heart and a little effort into their plots.So when I heard they are going to make another film based off a series of books/comic strips like Horton Hears a Who and the Peanuts Movie, I thought whatever the source material is, it should be great but not near perfect, the trailer did seem to go in that direction, It looked colourful and beautiful and was a little funny but I seen these sorts of films before, so as expected I was looking forward to It.And then the film was released with a rather mixed reception, critics liked It fine and audiences weren't too kind to it and...... yeah I have mixed feelings about this movie, I don't think It's bad but not all that great despite the fact I saw it twice so let's Get Into It.The plot is pretty straight forward, based on the book and the Disney short of the same name, it's about harmless Bull who just wants to smell flowers and never wanted to hurt anything or anyone, however after escaping a ranch and living his life with a young girl on a farm, Ferdinand gets mistaken for a beast and gets taken back to the ranch from before and now has to get home.There's really nothing to it, It does have it engaging to the point of caring about what's going on, It has good comedy and good amount of heart that does effect, but the problem is that the plot is far too predicable for me to really get into a lot, I got into this film don't get me wrong but not too much, but it is nicely executed and it doesn't rely on too much fart humour (yes it does a bit of potty humour but not too much of it) so I'll give It that but at the same time it's not all that original.The Animation is one of the few things that I like about the film and Blue Sky's animation is always great, It's cartoony, colourful and very beautiful and It all fits together very well, here It's great as always, all the characters from the bulls to the humans are Nicely designed, the backgrounds and atmosphere of Spain makes it almost like Spain it's self and I could look at It all day every day, It's just that good, the textures are all great with the all the bull's different skins and textures all blends in very nice, however one nitpick I have is with the design of Ferdinand, it looks a little too simplistic, it looks like it came out of completely different animated film, it's not horrible or anything, it just seems looks really out of place, but none the less It's Fantastic.Most of the characters I generally like, Ferdinand Is really likeable and relatable, Nina's good too as well, the other Bulls have personality as well, my favourite bulls are Angus and Bones because Angus Is Voiced by David Tennant and whatever he's In It's a yes from me and Bones can be funny and likeable for the most part, the rest I do like but I like Bones and Angus the most, the Hedgehogs are decent and do play a somewhat big part, their like the Penguins from Madagascar except their hedgehogs In a film about a bull, Lupe was one I wanted to like but came off as annoying, I like Kate McKinnon, I think she's funny and a really lovely looking actress, but you could of done a lot more with Lupe then just being a comic relief, the others are nothing too special, the horses are funny sometimes, El Primero is just there most of the time to look intimidating to Ferdinand, Paco Is just a Last edition to being a comic relief, and that's about your lot, the rest are not bad but they don't do all that much to stand out, however they are all well voice acted, with John Cena, Kate McKinnon, David Tennant, Bobby Cannavale, Anthony Anderson, Gina Rodriguez and more, they all voice act very well even If they done It before and It doesn't feel out of place.(sigh..) I really wanted to enjoy Ferdinand, I really do and I did have fun with It most of the time, but It just comes off as mediocre and average. Ferdinand may not be Blue Sky's best or worst, It's right in the middle, It is better then Ice Age Collision Course, It has fantastic animation, good voice acting, good heart and good comedy, but it's very predicable, the film plays It safe for children (for the most part) and it's really nothing special, sure it got nominated for two Golden Globes but that doesn't mean It's a Oscar worthy film (oh wait...), maybe the music by John Powell and the song ""Home"" might be Oscar-y, but nothing stands out apart from what I mentioned, but at the very least it's far better then the Emoji Movie 100%.Take your children to see It, It's harmless fun that they'll enjoy none the less, it won't be box office gold because Star Wars: the Last Jedi is out and that's doing well but do see It with a family while it's still showing.I'm going to give Ferdinand 7.9/10.",Ferdinand

58,Bulldog1721,Tour de force of animation glory...,9,22 March 2018,"I have been anticipating this movie for quite sometime. This animation movie was pretty generalized in terms of how the storyline created a few pot holes in the road competing with Coco and Justice League. If that wasn't enough praise, this movie was astonishing adorable and very cute.It's cast really did a good job with the voice acting and John Cena really made the star of the hour ""pop"" with flair and power. The story couldn't have been changed in a way to see this movie being overwhelmed by movies that made this movie go in the dark...Overall, Well-thought out movie, excellent cast, fantastic storyline, just phenomenal overall. I hate that this movie was undermined by critics. But this movie should be on your watch list if you have younger kids for sure!",Ferdinand
59,MichaelNontonMulu,A Nice Story of an Extraordinary Bull,7,15 December 2017,"This movie was about a bull who had to make a bold choice in his life. The story was not very heavy and quite easy to understand but there was a major moral message in the movie where anybody could and should be anyone they wanted to be even if it was of different nature. This film was rather light and gave us some laughters combined with brief emotional moment. Despite starting off rather slow, but from the middle onward, Ferdinand's character would grow on you. It was fun to see a very very big bull who would be scary to all people but loved to smell flowers.In an era of more serious & heavy animated movie especially those from Disney and Pixar such as Coco, this movie brought some freshness and I believed would be much easier to understand by children. When my wife and I saw this movie, there were quite a lot young children as well and they were able to laugh on most of the funny scenes. This is understandable since the movie was based on a children's book titled The Story of Ferdinand.The movie was very very colorful and the animation was actually pretty good and beautiful. It was no doubt due to produced by Blue Sky Studios which produced other hit animated movies such as Ice Age series, Rio and The Peanuts Movie. This one was a nice movie where you could enjoy fun times and few touching moments, specifically the climax where my wife was quite emotional. Although it was rather light, apparently this film was good enough to be nominated for 75th Golden Globe's Best animated movie. Oh, there was a brief quite funny moment in the middle of end credit scene. So if you are looking for a fun light hearted movie, easy enough to understand for whole ages, then this one could certainly be an option, especially if the children are already on holiday. One thing that audience have to remember is that this is not up to the caliber of those Disney/Pixar movies so there is no need to compare with those movies. for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Ferdinand
60,benm-41751,"Although it gets out of control, this is a funny movie with a heart",7,16 February 2018,"Ferdinand is an over-the-top cartoony movie about a massive bull who's expected to be a fighter but only wants peace. It gets wildly energetic, sometimes to the point of being too much. The crazy goat, especially, is a really bizarre character that sometimes makes me laugh and sometimes just makes me uncomfortable. But if you're in the right mood and don't take it too seriously, there are some pretty silly and funny moments in the movie. Something I like too is that most of the characters, for all their quirks, have a moment of vulnerability. The few calm moments reveal a lovely message about putting down arms and soaking in the simple joys of life.",Ferdinand
61,kikoydaba3,"a heart warming tale about a pacifist bull who refuses to be a fighter, but ends as an overall disappointment",6,11 August 2019,"Ferdinand offers a good time as a heart warming tale about a pacifist bull who refuses to be a fighter, but ends as an overall disappointment due to out of place comedy, unexplored potential and faulty story telling.With decent CGI and a good soundtrack and score, Ferdinand is technically good. The direction is stirring enough to command the attention of the audience. John Cena, voicing Ferdinand, is perfect casting as he embodies the philosophy and design of the character. The rest of the voice cast is a mixed bag, however.The story has serious thematic depth but is mostly left unexplored or sidelined such as being about animal rights. For majority of the film the comedy overtakes the character interactions. Ferdinand remains the same character throughout the story and should have started with a conflict of personality from being a pacifist and fighter at the same time. More time should have been spent on his childhood because it would have properly established those personalities. Because of that lack of conflict, Ferdinand does not grow as a character. Ferdinand's time during his first escape should have occurred later in the story. Valiente should have been presented more because he is the best side character. The flower as symbolism for life and yearning of freedom is a nice touch.For entertainment purposes, it serves its purpose but as an engrossing film it fails.",Ferdinand

This was also a good opportunity to explain to my son why being cruel to animals is wrong and unacceptable in a way in which he could relate to what he had seen in the film.

It was a bit slow in the middle at one spot I thought, but generally entertaining for me as well. There is a reason this is PG, namely that it is about bulls that are raised for fighting in the ring - If you know the story of Ferdinand you know the basics, and the movie included some elements from the book so those were nice to see. There are some of the usual innuendos these cartoon movies only adults will understand, but the characters are varied enough it keeps the movie hopping along. Towards the end the young bulls realize the bull never wins in the ring, thus bringing the subject of death into the movie, the momentum quickly shifts to the comedic as the characters break out from their confines, and in the end they all live happily ever after...Entertaining, likable, not a classic but good little movie.",Ferdinand

87,macianciolo,Fine just a bit run of the mill,5,24 September 2018,"There are worse animated movies out there, and there are better ones. To me, the animation feels slightly plasticity and if you've seen enough kid flicks, you know about parent deaths. The biggest turn aways for me were the dancing German horses who wouldn't shut up, the slapstick and I felt as if the movie tried too hard to be good. If you wanna see a movie with a taste of Spanish/Mexican culture, I'd recommend COCO or Book of Life. Nothing against the movie, to me it's just not that great.",Ferdinand

Better than Turbo (the only other animated movie I can think of where I did notice the slow parts), but it isn't the best animated movie ever. The kids will watch it a few times. I don't see it becoming a classic, but the first watch will definitely entertain you!",Ferdinand
91,christinemsky,Effective Cliches with Creativity in Details,7,1 March 2018,"A similar watching experience as what I had when watching Sing (Garth Jennings & Christophe Lourdelet, 2016). There are flaws and cliches, but the cliches work well and move me. There are brilliant, creative ideas in this film. The dancing competition between bulls and horses impresses me. I sense the vaudeville quality and styles in classical Hollywood musicals from the first several scenes, but it is a little disappointed for me that it changes into a more modern style of dancing afterwards. The horses represent a bourgeois and elitist view, which are explicitly satirized. Even till the moment Ferdinand and some others decide to save their friends at the chop house, where I though they will reach out for help from the horses, instead, they solve the problem by solidarity. It is a cliched idea of how people can rise from an inferior status by uniting and fighting the same ""war"". Also, they succeeds by trapping the horses and the horses are punished in the end, which are a more obvious satire and somehow a kind of venting. Another moment I find quite interesting is the bull who eats the electric wires later on operates CPR on a bunny. The most brilliant settings, from my perspective, are the scene during Madrid Finale. The film depicts three major different interactions and links them unexpectedly and humorously in terms of the active or passive position of Ferdinand and the bullfighter: the bullfight, an exchanged-position version of that, and bull riding. The cliched moment filled with sensations when Ferdinand sacrifice for his friends (unbelievably) works for me, as I physically feel like to cry. So as the montage sequences with touching background music before the Finale. 
 In addition to all these referring to the story and sequences, the setting of the protagonist is intriguing. On the one hand, he reminds me of Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield in Hacksaw Ridge (Mel Gibson, 2016), as both protagonists insist on their own systems of values and refuse to fight. But instead of the absolute rejection to violence in Desmond, we actually witness Ferdinand gets close to crossing the boundary he sets for himself. But the film conserves his quality with him getting upset for stepping on a flower and forgiving the bullfighter, which are the expected scenes for me. On the other hand, the way Ferdinand caring about his friends reminds me of the things that have been happening during these days in my life. It is partially out of the scope of the film, but I really want to say ""thank you"" to all the ""Ferdinands"" in my life.",Ferdinand
92,jimdext,Classic Disney,9,3 November 2019,Critics of the animation have no sense of the art. The story is pure schmatlz. A great flick for kids. Totally a family movie. I give it a nine only because tens are rare and this fantasy flick needs a higher rating. The naysayers are wrong.,Ferdinand

96,daddylovesisaac,"Good, but not great",7,18 December 2017,"'Ferdinand' was a nice, gentle, funny movie about a gentle bull called Ferdinand who learns to be a fighting bull. Along the way, we have some descent characters including a young girl who decides to look after Ferdinand, a female goat, Ferdinand's dad who goes to fight and promises him he will come back. However, sadly this does not happen. They are not even 'reunited' in the fighting stadium scene like I expected. I think he possibly died fighting. Halfway through the film Ferdinand sees a photo of his dad (I think) and sobs. Also, there were some bits from the trailer that were cut. For example, the scene where Ferdinand is in a chinashop. Plates and things leap onto Ferdinand's nose, horns and feet. The owner sniffs out Ferdinand with a brush, and he sneezes. In the trailer he says 'Sorry!'. But in the movie the scene cuts before he says it. This movie also has some heart, nor a type of movie that I really like. As you already know, Ferd's dad did not come back, however at the end he seems fine how he is. I think they should have made the movie longer for Ferdinand to realise about his father, and then have him come back. Not enough laughs, but I like it. So i'm giving this a 7/10",Ferdinand
97,gemmamcdermott,Enjoyable film,9,26 April 2018,I enjoyed watching this film! It was very heartwarming and had comedy that both adults and children could enjoy!

98,grrr-25,"""Looks like weird is the new normal buddy...""",1,9 March 2019,"Anyone remember the short Ferdinand the Bull from Disney in 1938? That was a nice little animation!Basically I do not like Blue Sky films, can watch all Ice Ages without even a smile... Though in the first few minutes I thought it would be a great film. And this feeling lasted for 5 minutes at most...
Because it is an extremely poorly written film.
Ferdinand's father would tell all his moves to son but just after becoming a champ. Why not before? Where did he live until now? Why did not teach his son before?
The calf ""Ferd"" jumps up to an unfamiliar, very big, loud, moving train (and he knows what it is for) but deadly afraid of a quiet, affectionate, young girl.
The girl just throws away her dog and SLEEPS with the big black... bull... errr yuck!
Those NOT FUNNY hedgehogs dancing to MACARINA (OMG)!
The goat is some sort of Scrat clone?!
Could enumerate all the ""weirdnesses"" but it is just do not worth... The whole film is a brainless hokum.It is very annoying that almost all today's films uses that cheesy american stilted ""cool talk"". Personality or clever jokes are not important but saying ""cool"" expressions in a factitious, affected way is essential. That is not funny. That is stupid.I would say go and watch the 80 years old Disney film with the whole story in a quick 8 minutes and save the other 100 to your family.",Ferdinand

It's full of family animation tropes and there's nothing original in the writing or animation. That said, it's not a bad or cringeworthy movie, just a very unoriginal one. Read the book. It's far more interesting and presents a lesson to be learned far quicker than meandering through pretty towns and countrysides to eventually end at a payoff you could see when the opening scene was finished.",Ferdinand

Spaniard, I also hate that people outside of Spain think we are Latin American. We look just like the French, Portuguese, Italian, British. We are European. Let that get through your thick heads. You can't expect to stereotype a whole bunch of nations who speak the same language into the same ethnic group. Let's put it this way: What does a New Zealand Maori have to do with an American Polish immigrant? Only the language, and to a certain extent, culture. Period. Stop stereotyping Spaniards. Oh, and many of us hate bullfighting! Unfortunately, too much money is involved into this blood ""sport,"" and I want it to disappear. Other than that, What a beautiful movie!!!!!!!",Ferdinand

It contains cartoony animation and movements, there's annoying pop songs shoehorned in when the bulls have a dance off with some horses (who have stereotypical German accents and act like pretty white boys????) only to fill up a few minuetes in the film. I'm not even sure if this is thst kid friendly as the bulls you've been attached to by them being given human voices, are sent to the slaughter house if they underperform! Of course it is subtle, but you're child is bound to ask what it means.Overall, I'm sure this would be fine to entertain some kids for 80 minuets, but just be aware that there's better kids films out there!",Ferdinand

There are a few things included for a better story that one may needs to suspend their belief, but going into the movie I think everyone knows it is about talking animals. Topics like the treatment of animals during/after bullfighting and with animals who have ""lost their usefulness"" alive on a ranch/farm are treated delicately enough that young children will probably not be frightened but may open up conversations later by older children and their parents. I really recommend this movie and it's nice to see some other production company besides Disney making a movie that both children and adults can enjoy.",Ferdinand

112,janetlynn-37349,Nope,2,29 June 2018,I did not like this at all. I have always loved the story of Ferdinand the Bull but this was far from what I was expecting. Odd underdeveloped characters paired with the awful plot sending the bulls that won't fight to the chop shop made me cringe internally. I almost turned it off when I realized they were going inside the slaughterhouse. The German show horses were ridiculous and the hedgehogs were odd. John Cena was good as Ferdinand and the scenes with him and Nina are the only reason I didn't give this a zero. I'm glad I borrowed this from a friend and didn't pay anything to watch this.,Ferdinand
113,bryanyblood,WHAT DID I JUST WATCH???!!!!,10,25 April 2018,"When I first heard about this movie, my expectations were incredibly low. Despite the main character being voiced by John Cena (which did seem promising), I still wasn't too interested in giving it a look. But eventually I was recommended this movie by a friend, with his review being scathingly negative; Which was when my attention was instantly caught. And after watching Ferdinand,... This might be one of the strangest movies I have seen in a very long time. And I absolutely loved it!! There is so much wrong with this movie, it completely baffles me! Ferdinand starts off slow and boring at first, and nothing out of the ordinary occurs throughout the first half of the film. I noticed one or two quotes recycled from 'Rio' that managed to slip in; which gave me the impression that the rest of this movie is going to turn out very generic, mediocre, and yes, there are plenty of overused cliches in the movie as usual with all kids films. But once you get to the second half, things take a humungous turn for the worst. I have never seen any movie pull something off like this. As you continue, be sure to expect the following: Dabbing horses, twerking bulls, abysmal character designs, obnoxious off-the-wall cartoony animation, laughable voice acting, lots of filler, a terrible soundtrack, and tons and tons of memes and pop-culture references. I was left cringing down to my internal organs. I kept asking myself ""WHY?"". Sometimes, it's hard to watch. I don't feel like this film was trying to pander to millennials as much as it was trying to annoying the hell out of them. The movie does indeed have a story, but it quickly becomes overshadowed by the shenanigans of the bulls and other side characters. What's most fascinating is how sometimes it becomes difficult to predict what happens next. You hardly ever know what trick this movie will pull off. And some jokes will fly over your head until you realize ""Did that seriously just happen?!"". There are other chaotic chasing scenes as well, which leave you stuck to your seat. But out of everything, what left me dumbfounded the most, was the ending; and how heartwarming and pleasing it actually was, compared to the rest of running time. The final act of the movie feels quite different from everything else I just witnessed. But either way, It ends on a very nice note. And it helps calm down the overall tone and takes your mind off the ridiculous excitement Ferdinand was delivering. All of what I have covered and more should be what you should expect when diving into this movie; As it was all expertly mixed together to create one of the funnest experiences you could ever have while watching a movie. I did enjoy Ferdinand very much, but I feel like it would've been an even better experience if I had other friends with me viewing it for the first time. Make no mistake; It is a lowbrow wild ride. And it does whatever it can to be off the rails with it's wacky humor. But that was all part of the enjoyment of it. If you did hate Ferdinand, I would totally see why; Trust me on that. Your opinion of the movie may definitely depend on your taste in media. But give it a watch for yourself and you'll see what I mean. I cannot recommend Ferdinand enough.",Ferdinand
114,heatherr-29963,Enjoyable cute and heartwarming!,9,26 December 2017,"It seems that some people think the jokes in this movie fall flat and there is too much unnecessary clutter, but I honestly really really loved this movie. It was a reluctant choice after not finding anything else playing that we wanted to see, but man am I glad we saw it!Ferdinand is the cutest bull I've ever seen, and I have to say I'm not familiar with this studio's other films but I thought the animation style was wonderful. I especially liked the wide range of expressions on Ferdinand's face throughout the movie, with a few close-ups that really captured the perfection of those expressions well. The story itself was inspirational and heartwarming, full of examples and discussions on being yourself and breaking the mold and not letting anyone else define who you are. There were some heavy-handed moments that I'm not sure a younger viewer would understand, or possibly that may be too bleak for a very young viewer. Some of the humor was a little more adult-oriented, but most of it was clean, although sometimes rather stupid. The ending is pretty much exactly what you'd expect of a feel-good kid's movie, and I liked it very much.",Ferdinand

Most of all, I loved how it made you feel that you could always leave your predetermined path in life, and do something you really want to do, and be someone you really want to be, as long as you have the guts to break free.I'll probably not re-watch it.

Masculinity is more of a sociological construct rather than an eternal unchanging truth.
