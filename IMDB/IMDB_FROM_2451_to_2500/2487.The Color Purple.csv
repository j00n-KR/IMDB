0,TheLittleSongbird,Powerful Colour Purple,9,16 January 2017,"Alice Walker's book is truly riveting, being hard-hitting, powerful and incredibly poignant. Anybody who hasn't yet read it, it is very highly recommended.In 1985, a film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg was released garnering several well-deserved Oscar nominations but sadly winning none. While the book is more detailed and has more depth, and the film is not quite as hard-hitting (though hardly sugar-coated and definitely not Disneyfied), this is in no way denouncing a wonderful early effort from Spielberg.Not quite one of his best films (not among his worst either), but, despite the worry as to whether his style would mesh with the tone of the story told, 'The Color Purple' is a strong sign of Spielberg taking on a very mature subject early on in his career (being before 'Schindler's List') and making a film, that regardless of how it compares to the source material, that's still powerful and moving. For me its only fault is that for my tastes everything felt too neatly wrapped up at the end.Spielberg directs impeccably however, under him the powerful drama never gets heavy-handed despite that it easily could have done and it is also genuinely poignant without falling into over-sentimentality that Spielberg has often been criticised for. 'The Color Purple' looks wonderful, being exquisitely shot and with evocative production design.Quincy Jones' score works remarkably well too, one that sears and soars with ease without being jarring or intrusive. The script provokes a lot of thought and has a lot of honesty and emotion. The hard-hitting story is as hoped told powerfully and movingly, not trivialising the horrors of its themes and the consequences of what happens to the characters.Whoopi Goldberg was rarely better than she is in 'The Color Purple', a wonderful performance with her face and eyes telling so much and one can really see how much damage what she went through has done. Danny Glover is sublimely nasty in one of his best performances worthy of an award nomination but overlooked. Pre-TV career Oprah Winfrey is in a different role, and does remarkably well, while Margaret Avery is affecting.Overall, a powerful and moving film, a worthy adaptation of an even better book. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Color Purple
1,Leofwine_draca,Saccharine sentimentality,6,16 September 2021,"A good novel to adapt but Spielberg's saccharine sentimentality overwhelms the whole thing and makes it tough at times. That it remains enjoyable is purely down to the talents of the actors involved, particularly Goldberg and Glover.",The Color Purple
2,SnoopyStyle,good work from Whoopi,6,28 September 2014,"Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg) grows up in the south during the early 20th century. By the time she's 14 years old, she's already given birth twice by her abusive father. She is married off to ""Mister"" Albert Johnson (Danny Glover) who abuses her and uses her more like a slave to take care of his bratty kids. Her younger sister Nettie (Akosua Busia) comes to stay but she rejects Mister once too many times. He kicks her out. Then the outspoken Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) who marries Albert's son Harpo (Willard E. Pugh) comes into Celie's life. Mister's lover Shug Avery (Margaret Avery) stays with them and befriends Celie. It also turns out that Nettie has been living with missionaries in Africa and sending letters to Celie but Mister has been keeping them from her.I feel worn out by the overwhelming oppression that befalls Celie. Steven Spielberg does it with a light touch that keeps it from being dark and sullen. Nevertheless I feel for Celie and suffer along side her. It's a big melodramatic farce period piece. I won't go as far as saying that this is one big stereotype. It does lack a certain realism. It feels like a folk tale. It says something about women empowerment. For that good intention and the expert production, it's a movie worth watching.",The Color Purple
3,mark.waltz,Officially now a classic!,10,8 May 2016,"Even though this made some changes from Alice Walker's novel that made some audience members and critics furious, this is still one of the best films to come out of the 1980's. As the revival of the hit Broadway musical version trods the boards of New York once again, a return visit to it is necessary as is the need for me to see this beautiful film once again.The cruelty of most of the male characters keeps the tragic prone Celie away from her beloved sister Nettie and her two illegitimate children, fathered through rape and cruelly taken away from her at birth. Celie, allegedly ugly, and Nettie, a sweet but strong beauty, are separated twice-first by their abusive father, and later by Mister, the demanding husband Celie is forced to marry simply to be his slave. Watching the shy, insecure Whoopie Goldberg suffer the way she does is often heartbreaking, and hers was one of the strongest film debuts in Hollywood history.In spite of her circumstances, Goldberg's Celie adds a sly smile to her persona, devoted (or at least fearful) to husband Danny Glover in spite of his cruelty. She may hate him, but she gets to know him inside out, even aiding him as he prepares to meet his sexy mistress, Margaret Avery. Whoopie gets a boisterous step daughter in law in portly Oprah Winfrey (another film debut) who along with Avery becomes Goldberg's guardian angel when they see Celie's true inner beauty. In spite of her relationship with Glover, Avery's Shug comes to understand the importance of sisterhood, creating a beautiful bond between these complicated women. Not all of the men are as nasty as Celie and Nettie's papa. Even Glover's Mister has his soft side, and as his cruelties catch up to him which he must atone for, he makes a choice of retribution that certainly saves his soul. Glover may be an s.o.b., but there are layers hidden beneath his brutality. Willard Pugh is the most likable, but he is a bit of a buffoon. His Harpo is no match for Winfrey's sometimes obnoxious Sophia, and often their relationship doesn't seem real. It also makes no sense that Celie, a victim herself, would shyly advise Harpo to beat Sophia. Winfrey comes to life in her confrontation with Goldberg, and her performance is heartbreaking when she is beaten up for saying ""Hell no!"" to flibbertigibbet white matron Dana Ivey who wants Oprah as her maid. Stage veteran Ivey shows several different angles to this do-gooder who may have sweet intentions, but causes more harm than good. Adolph Caesar is appropriately obnoxious as Glover's father (showing the audience some of the reasons that Glover turned out the way he did), while Rae Dawn Chong is bubble headed, but ultimately showing strength, as Squeak who finds out that ""Fine by me"" ain't so fine for her. The colors of the country are enhanced by Quincy Jones' excellent musical score. Two songs are thrown in, but neither were in the musical. Director Steven Spielberg was snubbed for an Oscar nomination in one of the biggest scandals in Academy Award history. There's no denying that professional jealousy was partly behind it. How a film which details triumph over tragedy could be completely overlooked for even one award remains a mystery to this day. The triumphs of the finale will have you in tears. Make sure you have a full box of Kleenex out. Regardless of how many times you've seen this, the tears are absolutely going to flow.",The Color Purple
4,classicsoncall,"""Yes indeed Lord. I know something's coming.""",8,10 June 2019,"It's difficult not getting emotional watching this film. The principal characters suffer racism, sexism, physical and mental abuse, and in Celie Johnson's (Whoopi Goldberg) case, the loss of a sister and theft of her children while a victim of rape. I don't know if it could possibly be worse for anyone, much less a person of color. The story is heart rending yet inspirational at the same time, as Celie perseveres through her misfortunes to become a person of noble character and inner strength. The race between her mentor Shug Avery (Margaret Avery) and the clock in that scene when Celie was about to shave or cut her husband's throat was one of the heart pounding moments of the film. Knowing what happened to Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) for sassing a white woman and knocking down the woman's husband, it would have been one of those life defining moments had she followed through on her righteous anger. A talented cast and an engaging story brought the movie a total of eleven Oscar nominations, and quite astonishingly, not a single win. The film's title implies that it's impossible to feel sad in a field full of purple flowers, and in it's closing moments, dares to remind us that even the worst of life's disappointments can give way to redemption and joy.",The Color Purple
5,gavin6942,Wasn't For Me,6,3 June 2016,"A black Southern woman (Whoopi Goldberg) struggles to find her identity after suffering years of abuse from her father and others over forty years.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film four stars, calling it ""the year's best film."" He also praised Whoopi Goldberg, calling her role ""one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history"" and predicting she would win the Academy Award for Best Actress. (She was nominated but did not win.) Now, with all due respect to Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover... this film just did not appeal to me. Not that anyone was bad, but I just never really got into it. I suspect this has something to do with Spielberg, and his need to be overly sentimental. Something about this film seemed like it was cynically designed to trigger emotions rather than achieve them organically.",The Color Purple
6,lee_eisenberg,It's hard to believe that this was Whoopi Goldberg's feature debut.,10,8 March 2006,"Taking a break from his escapist run in the early '80s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple"", about about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg play Celie, it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like ""Sister Act"". This is the sort of movie that could easily be - no, make that SHOULD BE - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies. There's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that's ever been on screen (you'll know it when you see it). I can't believe that this didn't win a single Oscar; it may be Spielberg's second best movie behind ""Schindler's List"" (maybe even tied with it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia, and Laurence Fishburne.",The Color Purple
7,jboothmillard,The Color Purple,8,12 July 2005,"From Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), I remember watching about half of this film in college, but I didn't remember it well and never finished it, it was probably the first film I ever saw dominated by African American stars, so I watched it again. Basically, set in the Southern United States between the 1900's to mid-1930's, at seventeen years old Celie Harris (Desreta Jackson) has given birth to two children, after suffering abuse and rape from her father Pa Harris (Leonard Jackson), he has taken both of them away from her. Local farmer 'Mister' Albert Johnson (Danny Glover) wants to marry Celie's younger sister Nettie (Akosua Busia), but their father refuses to let her be wed, so he lets him have Celie. Mister neglects and abuses her as they live together, and he forces her to be his slave, cleaning the house, shaving him and making his meals, and then Nettie comes to live with the because of their father continuing to be incestuous. After failing to have his way with Nettie, Albert angrily forces her out and away, never to come back, leaving Celie distraught, but she promises to write to her until death, of course she never receives any. Years pass, Celie (introducing Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Whoopi Goldberg) is now a woman still forced to have a miserable life, but she keeps to cope with her routine, while her still sometimes abusive husband has a lover with jazz singer Shug Avery (Oscar nominated Margaret Avery). Celie and Shug do become friends though, and her confidence is lifted, they even begin an affair themselves, and she also finds a friendship with Sofia (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Oprah Winfrey) who is also beaten badly, but she fights against it. As the years have passed and no letters have come for her, Celie has believed that Nettie may be dead, but in fact she been living in Africa with missionaries, she and Shug find dozens of her letters hidden away. After almost slitting his throat, it is after a dinner, with a permanently disfigured Sofia attending, that Celie finally finds the strength to stand up to and leave Albert. She explains that she knows he kept the letters hidden from her, and she, Shug, Shug's husband Grady (Bennet Guillory) and Squeak (Commando's Rae Dawn Chong) - girlfriend of Albert's son Harpo (Willard E. Pugh), are coming with her. Finding a new peaceful life in Tennessee, and opening a new ""one size fits all"" clothes shop, Celie finds out that her father was not her biological father, but her stepfather, and she inherited the shop and a house from her real father. Albert meanwhile has let Celie's hateful words get to him, and he has realised he really was bad to her, guilt finally catches up with him, and unknown to his ex- wife, he pays his money to immigration to arrange a reunion with her sister. In the end Celie is tearful and overjoyed as she and Nettie are finally reunited, as well as Celie's two grown up children, son Adam (Peto Kinsaka) and daughter Olivia (Lelo Masamba), Albert smiles from a distance, and Shug smiles at him for doing the right thing, Celie and Nettie play their childhood hand clapping game as the sun sets. Also starring Dana Ivey as Miss Millie, Laurence Fishburne as Swain, John Patton Jr. as Preacher and Carl Anderson as Reverend Samuel. In her first screen performance Goldberg is superb as the leading character living through the years of abuse, standing up to it, and of course finding hope in the company of others, Glover is great as the nasty husband who beats and mistreats her, Avery does very well with her singing and being sympathetic, Winfrey - before her chat show began - is terrific as the also beaten wife who can defend herself, and the other cast members do well too. Spielberg is a good choice as director, because it was apparently a difficult novel to make into a mainstream film, but it is done without becoming too glossy, it is done with great dignity and aplomb, a most impressive period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Music for Quincy Jones and many more, Best Song for ""Miss Celie's Blues (Sister)"", Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 51 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",The Color Purple
8,ccthemovieman-1,Vintage Spielberg In Both The Good & Bad,7,27 January 2007,"As with many Steven Spielberg films, this is a beautiful-looking movie, scene-after-scene almost looking like paintings. To me, that was the main attraction of the movie because the story - although powerful - to me, wasn't as appealing as the rich visuals. It's also one of those films almost guaranteed to bring a tear or two to ones eyes at the end.This is much more involving story if you are a woman or black person, because you can relate more to the characters in the film. As with typical Hollywood, political correctness rules: most of the men (white or black) are bad while the women (mostly black) are all good. If you are a male watching the movie, this bias in the story can be very annoying.Individually, I remember first watching this (I've seen it a couple of times) and being surprised what a good actress Oprah Winfrey was, and how appealing was Whoopi Goldberg's character ""Celie."" Goldberg became a star after this film (also for her comedy appearances on TV) but I always thought this role was, by far, her best or, at the least, her most appealing.Rae Dawn Chong never looked prettier and Margaret Avery played a real charmer. Danny Glover was effectively nasty. You wanted to punch his lights out!Overall, expect for what I mentioned above, this was good storytelling and certainly an involving, emotional story.",The Color Purple
9,moonspinner55,"Too careful and slick overall, but undeniably moving...",6,2 October 2005,"Steven Spielberg's too-bright, overlong, slickly-designed adaptation of Alice Walker's book about a repressed black woman in the old South living at the mercy of her brutish husband, mourning her separation from her beloved sister, and having a flirtatious friendship with a sexy female singer who passes through town. Spielberg guides the viewer through the crowded script quickly and with ease, and the introductions to the characters are jazzy and direct; but, whereas the director is terrifically at home with his cast, he doesn't seem to know how to stage this story. It's mounted like ""Gone With the Wind"", with a sweeping grandeur that treats the material with cartoonish reverence. Results are both moving and sticky, with finely-wrought sequences quickly followed by banal whimsy and heartache. Whoopi Goldberg is terrific in the lead, and some of the dialogue has a haunting, evocative feel, but we're never aware of this as anything but a movie, staged and mechanically set-up to wring tears. **1/2 from ****",The Color Purple
10,edwagreen,Color this Excellent-The Color Purple ****,10,3 January 2010,"Color this 1985 film as excellent. Steven Spielberg's film was literally robbed of the Oscar for best picture. ""Out of Africa"" was the winner and was a far inferior film to this one.Our heroine, Whoopi Goldberg received a well-deserved best actress nomination for the ignorant girl Cele. She lost the Oscar to Geraldine Page, the perennial Oscar loser, who finally won for ""The Trip to Bountiful."" In a very close observation, Page was better but Goldberg gave her all in this meaningful picture.Black men certainly were depicted here as slave drivers, mean and rotten to the core regarding the lives of the women they came in contact with. Brutal is basically the word to be described that women such as Cele, Shug (Margaret Avery) and Oprah Winfrey, as Sofia, endured in this film. All received acting nominations and they were all outstanding.This is truly a gritty remembrance of the black experience. Redemption comes at the end of this superlative film.",The Color Purple
11,sunwarrior13,A Masterpiece,10,26 September 2012,"Based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Color Purple is a richly-textured, powerful film set in America's rural south. Whoopi Goldberg makes a triumphant screen debut as the radiant, indomitable Celie, the story's central character. Her impressive portrayal is complimented by a distinguished cast that includes Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey, Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar, Rae Dawn Chong and Akosua Busia.It was directed by Steven Spielberg.The film spans the years 1909 to 1949, relating the life of Celie, a Southern black woman virtually sold into a life of servitude to her brutal husband, sharecropper Albert. She pours out her innermost thoughts in letter form to her sister Nettie but Albert has been hiding the letters Nettie writes back, allowing Celie to assume that Nettie is dead. Finally, Celie finds a champion in the don't-take-no-guff Sofia, the wife of Glover's son from a previous marriage. Alas, Sofia is brought back to reality when she is beaten into submission by angry whites. Later, Celie is able to forge a strong friendship with Albert's mistress Shug. Emboldened by this, Celie begins rifling through her husband's belongings and finds Nettie's letters. Able at last to stand up to her husband, Celie leaves him to search for a new life on her own.Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic approach to filming. His tactics made the it controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of his decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable.It is a great, warm, hard, unforgiving, triumphant movie, and there is not a scene that does not shine with the love of the people who made it.Truly,a sentimental tale that reveals great emotional truths in American history.",The Color Purple

13,grantss,"Interesting, emotional drama",8,10 May 2020,"Georgia, 1909. With an abusive father, the only person who 14-year old Celie cares for and loves is her younger sister Nettie. Then Celie is married off to Albert Johnson, a brutal, uncaring man. After an incident between Nettie and Albert, Albert bans Nettie from his property and it appears that Celie may never see her again.An interesting, emotional, epic drama directed by Steven Spielberg. Very engaging, as we follow Celie's life, its trials and tribulations, ups and downs. The abuses she suffers at the hands of her father and husband are a harrowing ordeal. There's also some interesting sub-plots with the Sophia / Oprah Winfrey one highlighting the racism and injustice of the times.Despite the long running time (2 ½ hours) the movie moves along fairly well and generally doesn't feel that long. There are perhaps one or two scenes which could have been cut but the film doesn't feel padded.Performances are all first-rate with Whoopi Goldberg to the fore as Celie. She received a Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey received Best Supporting Actress nominations.Another feature of the film is the excellent soundtrack, written and produced by Quincy Jones. A great mix of blues and gospel.All in all The Color Purple received 11 Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, but, unfortunately, didn't win in any category. This is the record for most Oscar nominations without a win, held jointly with The Turning Point (1977).",The Color Purple
14,Boba_Fett1138,Spielberg for the first time showing different new colors as a director.,8,2 April 2011,"As much as I love Spielberg, I never have been too fond of his more dramatic movie attempts. The drama in his movies often feels very melodramatic. This movie was his first real, straight-forward, dramatic endeavor and though I also have some real problems with this movie, people seem to forget and fail to see that as far as the genre goes, this still truly is one excellent movie. People look at this movie and see that it's not up to Spielberg's usual high standards of entertainment and film-making but that doesn't mean at all that this movie is an horrible one.There is simply no denying it that this is a skillfully made movie. It has all of the right settings and actors in it, as well as a compelling dramatic story, that focuses mainly on an African American woman, living and trying to survive life in the early 1900's America. She has to face lots of ordeals, such as the forced split-up of her and her sister that she was incredibly close with, taking beatings and rape. It's not necessarily a movie about racism, though it still plays some part in the story but it's more one that focuses on African American society, in rural areas, in the early 1900's and on its women and their position in particular. It follows its characters for some decades. Some things change for them, while others keep remaining the same. It's a good character driven drama with a compelling story, that ensures that the movie is always going and good to watch, even though the movie is being a bit of a long sit.It really is a movie that foremost works out thanks to its characters and actors that are portraying them. Amazingly enough two of its key characters are being played by débutantes; Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey but what a fine debut it was! Both are truly excellent and its hard to recognize them in this movie, not necessarily because they look different and younger but more because of their performances, that is unlike anything they have ever done since. I truly wish Whoopi Goldberg would had continued playing more roles like this, instead of choosing a more comical career. How different her career must have been but she wanted to stay loyal to her comical background instead, which is of course her right to do. But with all this talking about Winfrey and Goldberg, people tend to forget how great Danny Glover is being in this movie as well. But this is also only because the movie is being a sort of ode to African American woman and their strength and also tells the story from their perspective.It all combined ensures that ""The Color Purple"" has something that a good drama requires; some good powerful emotions and drama. It's a touching movie that perhaps goes a bit over-the-top at times but overall as a whole still works out as some powerful and memorable.Can't say I'm too fond about its last 30 minutes though. The movie tries to desperately to wrap everything up needly. Everything ends well for the 'good' guys and gals and the 'bad' ones end up badly. It feels a bit forced, as if Spielberg was too afraid to that his movie would end on a downer and would leave its audience depressed. This is actually something quite a lot of Spielberg movies suffer from; they desperately try to end on a positive and uplifting note. Even ""Schindler's List"" somewhat does!It's far from my favorite Spielberg movie and it's also far from the best thing he has ever done but this movie still remains one fine, effective, powerful 'colored' drama, that by the way still really is missing a John Williams musical score.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Color Purple
15,view_and_review,Movie was Better than Book,7,15 August 2019,"The Color Purple, to me, is one of those rare movies that is better than the book. All of the performances were excellent and I think none were better than Danny Glover as Mister aka Albert. He was so good at being such a horrible human being.Some of the broader themes from the book were a bit muted in the movie. It was still about Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) and her plight and that couldn't be missed. What was toned down was the lesbianism on the part of Celie as well as the misandry. The book is filled with both overt and subtle misandry to the point that you get the clear impression that the author herself hates men. There's hardly a man in the book that is free of being some type of oppressor of women.The movie never conveyed that as much as it conveyed Celie's horrible experiences with her father and her husband. Kudos for whoever adapted it for the big screen because it became a better production.",The Color Purple
16,evanston_dad,God Help Us All When Spielberg Feels Guilty About Something,7,8 April 2008,"Well zip-a-dee-doo-dah, I kept expecting Uncle Remus to come bounding out of the bushes while watching Steven Spielberg's screen adaptation of the Alice Walker novel.In retrospect, Spielberg shouldn't have been let near this story with a ten-foot pole. His maudlin, well-intentioned approach to liberal message movies is completely at odds with Walker's spare, unsentimental storytelling. But, all in all, the results could have been much worse. Yes, Spielberg paints a painfully one-dimensional picture of poor blacks in the 1930s South. Yes, his way of exorcising his white guilt is to make the sole white character in the movie (played by Dana Ivey) a dithery twit, and his way of dealing with Walker's feminist elements is to make all of the male characters idiot buffoons. But the movie does have its good points, like a luminous performance from Whoopi Goldberg in the role of Celie, the ugly young woman who finds the beauty within herself, and an equally lovely performance from Margaret Avery, the sultry nightclub singer who helps Celie with her awakening. Oprah Winfrey huffs and puffs her way through a caricature of a performance as Sofia, the big black woman who goes around telling people what's what.Mr. Money Bags Spielberg ensures that the film has top-notch production values, and indeed it does look beautiful, and Quincy Jones provides a warm, pleasant score.Not the stunning film that could have been made from such good source material, but not a disaster either.Grade: B+",The Color Purple
17,HotToastyRag,One of the greatest Oscar snubs in history,10,5 October 2021,"I've read the book, and Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Menno Meyjes turned it into a masterpiece. There's so much they added to the story, so much they cut out, so much they enhanced, that it almost defies description. I know there are those out there who really appreciate the novel, but there's one thing we can all agree on: The Color Purple got shafted at the Academy Awards. The eleven nominations (without Best Director, if you can believe it) should have swept up the ceremony, but instead it remains one of the worst snubs in history.One of the signs of an excellent movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you still get more out of it. I've seen this movie more times than I can count (it was even shown on the big screen for study material at film school), and I always find something new that the filmmakers or actors did to make the finished product perfect. It's so perfect that if Hollywood remakes it for added popularity during the current social climate, I won't even rent it. Certain movies, like The Great Gatsby, should be left alone when there's no room for improvement.Believe it or not, there are youngsters out there who have never seen this movie and don't even know what it's about. When they do watch it, they'll in for quite a shock - no, not because of the extremely heavy storyline that starts its opening scene with the pre-teen protagonist giving birth to a baby incested by her father - the shock young folks will find is with the cast. The funny lady on The View was actually an incredible actress once upon a time? That nice old guy who always whispers played villains thirty years ago? And world-famous Oprah once took a supporting role? It's always fascinating when people have a generational career. The first movie my best friend saw Danny Glover in was The Color Purple, and she was scared of him for years. I didn't see this movie until I was much older, and by that time I only thought of him as the nice guy from Dreamgirls. When we look back and see these performances from the women in the cast, it's such a shame that they weren't continuously offered such meaty roles. Oprah took a different path that led to being a world-famous icon, but if she'd been given more chances to show off her acting chops, she might not have left Hollywood. Whoopi Goldberg's performance was so vivid, painful, and real, her make-up Oscar for Ghost was a terrible insult. She was relegated to comic relief parts when she was capable of so much more. Playing a character who has to stuff her feelings inside and also act them large enough for the camera to see is quite a challenge. Aging onscreen and letting the audience see the toll the years have taken on her is difficult, and balancing all the different feelings she has towards all the different characters is complicated and complex. This was a tour-de-force, and the Academy rewarded her by saying, ""Nope. You should stay in subservient roles playing kooky characters the audience can laugh at.""Danny Glover also had a difficult character to work with, since he was the villain. A great villain isn't truly evil, but instead becomes human and makes the audience understand him. When we see the relationship he has with his father, Adolph Caesar, we understand his need to bully. When we see his insecurity and desire to please his mistress, Margaret Avery, we understand the inner torment he lives with every day. Margaret has her own intense family problems she holds in her heart, but rather than inflict her pain on someone else, she channels it into healing and support for others.I love the scene transitions in this movie; they flow so seamlessly that even though you're aware you're watching a movie, you can't really imagine the lights, boom mic, and camera capturing everything. But since there was all that equipment and technical work behind what we're seeing, we owe a great compliment to Steven Spielberg. His sensitivity to get such wonderful performances from his actors, the detail of his eye to fill the frame with authentic looking props, sets, and costumes, and keeping the big picture in mind while filming all the little pictures; he had an enormous burden on his shoulders every single day he worked on this film. With a movie so full of intense drama, it would have been easy to turn it into a melodrama with every scene featuring a massive catastrophe. Instead, he kept everything realistic and tame, letting the emotions speak for themselves. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for your beautiful work.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to adult content, I wouldn't let my kids see it until they were at least 16.",The Color Purple
18,namashi_1,A Remarkable Film!,8,22 September 2010,"Steven Spielberg's supremacy is once again proved with his 1985 classic 'The Color Purple'. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Alice Walker, comes out A Remarkable Film in all respects. The legendary filmmaker takes a difficult subject in hand, dealing with poverty, racism, and sexism. And he doesn't go wrong! 'The Color Purple' tells the story of a poor African American girl named Celie and shows the problems African American women faced during the early 1900s.Let me inform you, 'The Color Purple' is not an easy film to watch. It's a dark film, dealing with domestic-violence and color-discrimination. It's not a gory film, but it has it's share of shortcomings, that can not be erased out.Steven Spielberg's direction is brilliant. He handles the subject with no insecurities. Menno Meyjes's Screenplay is grim and completely justificational. Allen Daviau's Cinematogrpahy is of top-grade. Michael Kahn's Editing is good.In the acting department, Oprah Winfrey is outstanding in a challenging role. She completely gives her herself to the character. Whoopi Goldberg is superb. She proves her range yet again! Danny Glover does not deliver. And what's with the accent? Margaret Avery, in a role that has layers, is wonderful. Akosua Busia is first-rate. Desreta Jackson who plays the child portions of Whoopi, is marvelous.On the whole, 'The Color Purple' is a great show. Without any doubts, Two Thumbs Up!",The Color Purple
19,Lejink,"""Roots"" are showing",6,27 February 2008,"Sprawling, rambling Spielberg take on the American Negro experience in the early decades of the 20th Century, focusing, interestingly enough, almost entirely on the dynamics within the Negro community. As a result, the usually all-pervading outside influence of the white community is almost entirely absent. The film is beautifully shot with many imaginative tableaux imaginatively portrayed by the director and the pacing of the film is well-handled, even as the narrative is naturally episodic as it follows the course of the Whoopi Goldberg character's life. However it's impossible not to defend Spielberg against his old failing, sentimentality. Perhaps this is due to a striving to garner a more universal screen censor rating and thus wider distribution for the movie but certainly it seems that the incest, violence, lesbianism and rape scenes are watered down, unnecessarily in my view. This applies particularly in the depiction of Oprah Winfrey's character whose incarceration for speaking back to a white woman sees her go from a sassy mouthy individual to a damaged, passive maid, who even so, miraculously comes around in time for the uplifting conclusion of Goldberg's reunion with her detached family. To me this leaves too much to the imagination and over-stretches credulity and I could say the same also for the brutality rained down on her and her sister by firstly their abusive stepfather and even more so her ""arranged"" husband. There's also a plainly daft sub-evangelical meeting near the end at which everyone gets to clap hands, sing and generally get healed in front of the reverend father, almost offensive in its patronisation and stereotyping and with all the depth of a pop-video. Perhaps the scene was a sop to Quincy Jones, the film's musical director but even so it jars and is clearly misplaced. As for the acting, I found it only passable if often mannered and no one, for me, giving a particularly award-worthy performance. Comparisons with the slightly earlier hit TV mini-series ""Roots"" are obvious (there's even a duplication of the famous scene in the former where Whoopi Goldberg serves a drink to her cold father-in-law, replete with added spit). It's years since I avidly watched ""Roots"" and yet it has and will I'm sure stay longer in my memory than Spielberg's flawed would-be epic.",The Color Purple
20,ElMaruecan82,"I'm poor, black, I might even be ugly, but dear God, I'm here...",10,14 November 2012,"This is Celie's reponse to the venomous enumeration from Albert, Danny Glover as the man who took almost thirty years off her life.And Celie is Whoopi Goldberg, in her first major role: a virtuoso performance where she bravely dilutes herself in the soul of a woman supposed to be dull and ugly, but only waiting for the right moment to bloom. And the moment came with the ultimate triumph when she finally found the courage to stand against Albert. She doesn't deny all the physical attributions, she's poor, she's black, she may even be ugly, but God, she lives. And after having witnessed two hours of a true hell of a life, we can only share the happiness that suddenly inhabits her heart.The reason I started with this scene is to remind how emotionally effective ""The Color Purple"" is. It might not surprise from a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, both admired and loathed for his capacity to exude great emotions on screen. And there is so much to be criticized, the contrast between the realistic drama and the whole postcard-like setting or some feminist undertones  but the story transcends all these flaws, elevated by the performances of Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey, all women seriously roughed up by life, and overcoming the racist and misogynistic adversity with what was at their hands. Indeed, ""The Color Purple"" provides a thought-provoking approach of the South, where another form of racism was prevailing. In the social ladder, a White had more rights than a Black man, but within the Black community, a man had to respect his father as his son would respect him, but women were powerless. But not equally powerless. Margaret Avery plays Shug, a sexy cabaret singer who could command men with her body. It's ironic that Albert, the bullying husband turns into a puppy with Shug Avery. And if a woman couldn't control people with sex appeal, physical and moral strength worked too. This is Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sofia, the wife of Albert's son, Harpo. She grew up in a family of men, and learned to state her presence the hard way.Both Shug and Sofia embody the fight of Black women, at the expenses of their dignity. Shug's own father, a pastor, disowned her, for she was the local slut, in return, she lost every faith in men and life, but at the end, she finally realized that there was some place in her heart for pure love, by befriending Celie. On the other side, Sofia had the most tragic character's arc, when she refuses to be the maid of the town's mayor through an unforgettable 'hell no', retorted by a severe pistol-punch on the eye, an 8-year sentence in jail, and maybe the worst punishment: finally working in the very job that got her in jail. The energy, the inner strength, the colorful attitude that made her character so irresistible in the beginning, had been totally drained out: she looked prematurely older, and only at the end, in the very scene I described, her dead spirit finally resurrects.Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey, both Oscar-nominated, are only supporting characters; yet they add a lot to Celie's own journey. Celie is a Black woman who not only was labeled as ugly, but also didn't even have the privilege of ugly women by remaining single. We meet her when she's fourteen and pregnant. She gives birth to two children and is quickly married to Albert who initially wanted Nettie, her much prettier sister. The father refused to give Nettie's hand for some reasons we guess to be personal, so Albert, who needed a woman to clean the house and take care of the ""young ones"" resigned to take Celie. Yet his eye is still interested on Nettie, and after an attempt to take advantage of her, he forbids her to visit her sister, a punishment worse than any slapping, beating or insult. What remains in Celie is the memory of her sister and the capability to read inherited from her teachings. And unlike Sofia with Harpo, Celie could never have the 'upper hand' on Albert, and unlike Shug, she didn't have the sex appeal. She was as low in the social ladder as any Black woman could be at the time, poor and ugly, yet the movie is about her realization that she deserves better. The most pivotal and emotional scene is when Shug teases her so she stops covering her smile, and then, with a magic that only cinema can apply, she smiles and bursts out laughing to the mirror. The 'mirror' scene is even more significant because it's not just Celie who starts appreciating herself, but also Shug who's inspired by Celie's genuine attraction to her. The following kiss is probably a more sugar-coated version of what the Alice Walker's novel featured, but the essential is that both women found reasons to be proud of them.Another miracle happens in the dinner scene, when Celie lets all his anger finally go on Albert, Sofia starts laughing and recovers from the wounds of the past. Celie has her 'hell, no' moment but with enough intelligence not to pull a knife on Albert's throat, which would have been as disastrous as Sofia's punch on the mayor. There is a lot of learning in ""The Color Purple"" and even Albert finds a way to redeem himself. After all, if there is one thing learned in the film, it's that it's never too late to change for the better, and no flaw, nor physical, sexual or racial can prevent a person to seek her own happiness. We all have an inner strength that could help us to overcome any adversity, ""The Color Purple"" is an invitation to find ours, through the triumph of three women, that we joyfully share with them, at the end of the film.",The Color Purple
21,g-bodyl,Steven Spielberg's Personal Masterpiece!,9,21 September 2014,"Now I have seen nearly all of Steven Spielberg's movies, but The Color Purple stands out as his own personal masterpiece. This film hits closer to home and it speaks an emotional, historical truth about a race who has been rejected in America from the birth of the nation to very recently. This movie is about how the black ladies want to be a part of society, not outcasts. There are provocative scenes in here proving just how racist people were in the early 20th century as evident by Mrs. Millie and the townsfolk. The story and direction are amazing. This film is also beautifully shot and this is a majestic masterpiece to behold.Spielberg's film is tells the story of a black woman named Celie from her teenage years to nearly thirty years later. The film talks about how she suffered abuse all her life from her father to her abusive husband, Albert. But she finds the strength to overcome her abuse when she meets two strong-willed women she finds comfort with.The acting is marvelous. Whoopi Goldberg, in her first film role, is excellent as the shy, weak-willed Celie. I've always thought as Danny Glover as one of the main good guys in Lethal Weapon, but now that may be overshadowed in his villainous, abusive role as Albert. Margaret Avery as Shug does an excellent job as Celie's role model. Likewise for Oprah Winfrey.Overall, The Color Purple is an incredible story about how this one woman overcomes the struggles of poverty, sexism, and racism to lead a good life and become closer to God. Her character is strongly defined as the movie progresses and her personality makes a unique change. There is a shed or two to be shed at times. The film may be just a tad long and some of the story could have been fleshened out, but this is definitely a personalized masterpiece. I rate this film 9/10.",The Color Purple

I swear if my partner hits me like that, I would get outta there and call the damn police! I just couldn't understand why Celie didn't run away from him in the beginning?! The poor thing suffered enough especially not having contact with her sister because of him!This film honestly makes you feel so angry, no one deserves to be treated like crap. I honestly wish the women on this stood up for their rights, surely there was at least activism regarding domestic abuse around that time?! There should've been if it wasn't mentioned, it's disgusting and shameful for victims to be left out!I couldn't understand why this film didn't get the 11 Oscars, it needed to be deserved something for awareness.

24,slightlymad22,It Should Have Swept The Oscars,9,10 April 2018,"Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come to The Color Purple.I think this is hands down the best movie of 1985. Yes I include Out Of Africa in that statement. It's not my favourite movie of 1985 (so many more easy to watch, enjoyable movie experiences that year) but it's the best. It's so powerful.This is an insanely brave move by Spielberg!! Looking for a bit of credibility from his peers he chose to make a movie about subjects that are not suited to the movies! It is not an easy movie to sell, nor is It an easy movie watch. The main character Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) endures rape, incest, sexism, an abusive husband, domestic violence, chauvinism, the loss of her sister (The only person who truly loved her) and the loss of her children at birth. Danny Glover is one serious piece of $hït in this!! He is vile, evil and despicable. Great acting. All of the cast is superb, none more so than Oprah Winfrey, she is superb as Sophia (what happens to her may be the saddest part of the movie) likewise Margaret Avery and Willard E. Pugh (who is the comedy relief as Harpo) Laurence Fishburn has a small role too. And then, at the center of the movie is Whoopi Goldberg in what must surely rank as one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history. She should have been the winner of the Academy Award for best actress that year. She is perfect. Sady we lost a great serious actress when she started going down the comedic route. I only have real complaint in that there should have been a tender and touching scene for Winfrey, but for some reason Spielberg decides to go for a slapstick scene that misses the mark. Once again a Spielberg movie had me in tears, the end is one of the great heart-rending moments in the movies. The Academy's prejudice against Spielberg is blatantly evident in the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director. The movie received 11 nominations, for Best picture, Best Actress, has 2 nominated for Best Supporting Actress, Best Writing, Best Art Direction, Best Cinamatography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Song, Best Score and Best Make Up, and a Best Director nod is conspicuously absent. And although The Color Purple had 11 nominations, it won not a single Oscar. His movies made too much money and were too popular for him to be considered a real film maker. The Color Purple was the fourth highest grossing movie of 1985 (behind Back To The Future, Rambo: First Blood Part 2 and Rocky IV) grossing $179 million at the domestic box office.",The Color Purple
25,didi-5,huge achievement from Spielberg,8,14 July 2004,"The film version of Alice Walker's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel (written largely as letters from the central character Celie to God) was a massive Oscar success, and rightly so.In the role of the abused and awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate. Others in the cast fleshed out the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force of change for the good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the much-missed Carl Anderson (otherwise best known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar) as preacher Samuel.Beautifully paced and sensitively written, 'The Color Purple' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama.",The Color Purple
26,filipemanuelneto,A great film about violence and racism.,7,10 February 2017,"Based on a book, the film tells the life of a young black woman who lived a good part of her life being brutalized by her father and her husband. This is a Spielberg movie, starring Whoopi Goldberg as the protagonist. Its story, touching and powerful, directly confronts the racism and machismo of a more conservative America. It's an exciting film, although the director makes a huge effort to avoid sentimentality (not always with success). Goldberg also shone, was totally at the level of the character in front of us, and proved to be extremely versatile, especially if we consider her to be an actress more accustomed to humor characters or a considerably more pronounced personality than Celie Johnson, a A woman clearly traumatized and accustomed to keeping her head down. Very different is the character who stunned the yet-unknown Oprah: Margaret Avery also came downstairs and knew what it was like to beat a man but her strong personality taught her to fight back. A final word for the scenarios, careful and detailed, appropriate to the time portrayed.",The Color Purple

In this case it's Danny Glover who is absolutely amazing in his role, probably the best performance of his career, and one of the best that came out of the 80s.But Goldberg and Oprah really stink. I don't know what was going on there but they were all over the place.However, despite them, Glover does carry the role, and Spielberg realized that this was a film adapted from a play. He kind of took that and ran with it, so the performances (minus two notable ones) were as earnest as you would get in live theater, the set designs, the camera movements, it all felt less like a movie and a lot more like, well, like you were seeing it live on Broadway.And, honestly, I think that worked. It was a unique approach and it made it wonderful to watch.",The Color Purple
29,kevin_robbins,I wouldn't change a single thing about this movie.,10,11 July 2021,"The Color Purple (1995) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX.

When friends from her past get more involved in her life some years later, hopefully she gains the confidence to stand up for herself. The movie is directed by Steven Spielberg (Jaws) and stars Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Whoopie Goldberg (Jumping Jack Flash), Oprah Winfrey (The Butler), Margaret Avery (Magnum Force) and Rae Dawn Chong (Commando). The storyline for this is so well written and delivers compelling characters and brilliantly shows their evolution. It is very compelling.

This is Spielberg, so the production values are first rate. The acting is good, and the photography outstanding. This is largely, I suppose, a feminist movie, as most of it is devoted to the female characters, and how cruelly oppressed they are by their men, husbands and fathers alike, being treated as property, (or slaves) including rape and forced incest being simply facts of life. I was surprised that it was an hour and a half in before the point was made about how evil white people are. The payoff at the end was sentimental, poignant, and powerful, a Spielberg trademark.

There are many sad scenes that hit hard, but at the same time other scenes are so stereotypical it's painful to watch. Also, it is supposed to be a depressing film, but there is a lot of humor and it really ruins the mood it was supposed to set up.

33,gcd70,A true affair of the heart,7,30 May 2008,"Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture into this genre. A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, ""Schindler's List"".Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. ""The Color Purple"" is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover lends solid support, though his ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart"". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong.Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery.This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video",The Color Purple
34,Boyo-2,Read the book,6,18 December 2000,"If you had read the novel by Alice Walker, there is no way you could enjoy the movie.  The novel is everything that the movie is not - smart, insightful, intelligent and memorable.  The movie is Hollywood Gone Amok - Spielberg may as well have ""E.T"" do a cameo.  He was still a little too infantile to tackle such material head on.  He didn't grow up as a filmmaker, in my mind, until ""Schlindler's List"".What we have here is a lot of unrealism (Celie serves Shug breakfast on matching China?  A poor black family has matching China?), a lot of stereotypes (men=Devils; women=Saints) and some horrible make-up when the characters age.  Best scene for me is Shug's reunion with her Dad who is a Preacher.  Its overdone and needlessly dramatic, but it gets me every single time I watch it.",The Color Purple
35,Steffi_P,"""Sister, remember your name""",6,15 March 2011,"In cinema, the 1980s are remembered for their action-filled blockbusters, gross-out comedies and weepy romances, but the most awards and critical praise of the decade went to mature, moving and inspirational dramas. Now we were past the age of censorship in the classic era and the stylistic excess of the 60s and 70s, and now more than ever great stories were being done justice on the big screen. And yet, the decade was still conflicted enough for things to be done wrong. The Color Purple is adapted from Alice Walker's beautiful 1982 novel, but was directed by prolific maker of blockbusters Steven Spielberg. The result is an unfortunate clash.This was the first time Spielberg had done an adult drama, but he had proved himself to be no stranger to deep and emotional touches, especially in E.T. However, for The Color Purple he comes across as overwhelmingly naïve, splurging on shots that simply call attention to themselves, continually casting shadows or flashing close-ups before us. All this is to the detriment of story and character. Take for example the scene in which Sofia is arrested. The moment she hits the mayor is done tantalisingly with a close-up of her hand, followed by a long shot, with the actual deed obscured by a passing car. All very clever, but this isn't the time for the director to be clever, it's a moment for the actress to shine, yet Oprah Winfrey's performance is sold short by the arty camera-work. The staging in this scene is horribly corny too, with all the white folks standing in a circle wagging their fingers, like some pantomime act. As for the various attempts at humour, these largely fall into the slapstick category, such as Harpo repeatedly falling through the roof or people scrabbling to get away from Miss Millie's driving, and they are simply undignified and inappropriate for this picture.And it's a real shame, because the acting in The Color Purple is of the highest calibre, and we ought to be able to see it with greater clarity. Whoopi Goldberg has a demanding task because Celie is a woman of so few words. However Goldberg is able to convey so much with a gesture, a glance, or an enigmatic half-smile. It's clear she understands the character, constantly feeling Celie's thoughts, and yet retaining enough mystery in her performance to keep it interesting. Margaret Avery has wonderful passion, her presence filling the screen. Although Oprah Winfrey may be a little exaggerated sometimes in her movements, her expression and vocal delivery are commanding and heartfelt. Danny Glover is great too, making his character menacing and abhorrent without descending into caricature.Indeed, there's a lot of professionalism gone into this movie. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, with sharp foregrounds against misty backdrops. The musical score by Quincy Jones (and others) is a little overwrought at times but has some lovely melodies to it, and the song ""Sister"" is a lovely slice of laid-back jazz. And Spielberg has his good ideas too, making endearing little shots like the snowman in the background when Sofia is reunited with her family. And above all things the powerful words of Alice Walker shine through, telling us a truth that has a universal and timeless meaning. This motion picture version of The Color Purple has a lot wrong in its execution, and yet there is enough to its raw material to leave us with something of value.",The Color Purple

Superbly directed by Anthony Minghella, it is still the only film to be nominated for 10 Oscars and win all 10. I am not taking anything away from that brilliant film.

Alphonse instead gets him to shack up with Celie instead. Albert operates a farm and has incorrigible children who purposely chastise Celie. When Nettie comes over to visit her sister, the once close-knit siblings part ways as Nettie avoids a possible rape from Albert.Throughout her time, Celie gets into a blossoming relationship with a blues singer named Shug (Margaret Avery) who's relationship with Albert while trying to be on good terms is her father who very much disapproves of her. Although Albert lures his charms among other things onto Celie, she has no children from him. All the while Albert's children are not anywhere seen on screen except for Harpo (William Pugh) who ends up marrying Oprah Winfrey's character Sofia.Other well known supporting roles include Adolph Caesar as Albert's father Old Mister, Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo's girlfriend Squeak, Dana Ivey as the liberal-minded Miss Millie and Laurence Fishburne as blues guitarist Swain.The ratings of this movie on imdb are quite high at 7.6. with the majority of fans liking this movie are the women with an 8.1 in favour while 7.6 were favoured by the men. The age range for the men who liked this movie are in the under 18 year old brackets at 8.0 while the viewers over 45 ranked it at 7.5. The majority of viewers will look at the film as a tale of strong, empowered women who stands up against the men who have done them wrong and to refuse being submissive to their immoral demands. And also to show if you stand up for what is right, good things will prevail.The critics will grumble about how the men in this film were badly depicted in this movie. They came across as being savage rapists who commit incest on their daughters and spend their time drinking whiskey until they've become inebriated. And if they weren't drunken rapists they were seen as simpletons like Harpo. But the women here get the hero's welcome as strong, independent and empowered, but only when they're threatening murder on their spouses and placing hexes on them. The white characters aren't treated any better here even though there are very few of them in this movie with maybe the exception of Dana Ivey's character Miss Millie.The thing that really gets to me about ""The Color Purple"" is that too many resolutions happen suddenly and without further explanations. So now Celie lives in the lap of luxury with the people she loves in an estate her biological father gave to her. If her father was so rich, why didn't she and Nettie stayed with him instead of being stuck with some pervert like Alphonse who in the end wasn't her real father? I'm curious as to how Shug was informed about Celie's death threats to Albert? Why did Albert keep all of Nettie's letters? Why would Miss Millie hire Sofia as her maid after spending nine years incarcerated?It should come as no surprise that in spite of being nominated for 11 Oscars not one performer or crew member walked away with one. It doesn't surprise me with the male-bashing and plot holes that leave many questions unanswered. Instead it panders into the mythology of feel-good elements in very similar veins like ""The Shawshank Redemption"". And sure it made Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey household names and the costumes and settings were top of the line, it still wasn't that great of a movie.",The Color Purple

But than again, is there any director who has made nothing but excellent movies? I can't think of one, but if you do, please let me know. But let's talk about this ""The Color Purple"" now. I first saw it on DVD when I was looking for the movies ""Trois Couleurs Rouge / Blanc / Bleu"" and this one stood right behind them. I didn't know much about it, but after reading the text on the box, I was intrigued. I didn't buy it, but I decided to put it on my To See-list and now that it was finally shown on television, I immediately taped and watched it.The movie tells the story of Celie, a 14 year old black girl who lives in the early 1900's with her abusive father and her younger sister. She is pregnant for the second time from her own father and when immediately after giving birth, a man comes to ask for the hand of Nettie, her better looking sister, her father tells the man that he can't have the youngest, but that he wouldn't mind if he took Celie with him, saying that she is damaged goods, but still able to work hard. She goes with the man and nothing really changes in her life. The man is as abusive as her father and only thinks about another woman: Shug Avery. But when Shug finally arrives, a lot is about to change and it doesn't take long before Celie finally dares to stand up against everybody who has done her wrong in the past, finally taking her life in her own hands and doing everything to become happy...A movie that takes about two and a half hours to completely explain its story is something that you don't get too often and I'm sure that many people don't like it a bit. They want some easy entertainment that takes only 90 minutes to tell what it has to say and that's something that they certainly will not get in this movie. And yet it is worth waiting for the last second of the movie to come. At first, I didn't like this movie all that much either, not yet knowing that it would take that long, but when the credits were rolling over the screen, I knew it for sure: This too is one of the better Spielberg movies.Thanks to the interesting performances by Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey,... this movie is more than just worth a watch. Especially Whoopi Goldberg surprised me in this one. Normally I'm not a great fan of her work, but in this movie she really showed a lot of talent. Also special was Danny Glover's performance. The man is best known for his role as Roger Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon movies and I must say that its nice to see him play that role, but it's also nice to see him play in a completely different kind of movie, in another kind of leading role. I saw him in ""Bat*21"" before and liked him in that movie, but in this film he was even a lot better, in his role as the abusive father. This time there was absolutely no humor around his performance or character, making it possible for the man to show that he's able to do a lot more with his talents than what most people know of him.Overall this is a very good drama that will probably not appeal to some people, just because of its length. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, because I'm already used to watch longer movies, but I'm afraid that several people will stop watching it after one hour and a half. And that's too bad, because you have to finish it in order to fully understand and appreciate it. I liked what I saw and give it a rating in between 7.5/10 and 8/10.",The Color Purple
39,sme_no_densetsu,An under-appreciated gem from Spielberg,8,30 May 2008,"These days Spielberg's ""The Color Purple"" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zilch. What's even more alarming is that Spielberg himself wasn't even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the film-makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded.The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It's told from a decidedly female perspective but you needn't fear that it's a saccharine 'chick flick'.The story is an interesting one, livened with humour at times although the central character's struggles are paramount. Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film's end but I didn't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes.The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think that Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly deserving and Danny Glover was unaccountably stiffed.As already mentioned, Spielberg didn't receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. Such an omission beggars belief, since Spielberg's direction here is top-notch. I'm not especially crazy about Quincy Jones's score but it's not below average by any means.In the end, the story is a satisfying one, well-told by a master film-maker working from Pulitzer Prize-winning material. Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on Oscar night.",The Color Purple
40,Screen_Blitz,Steven Spielberg's powerful portrayal of abuse and racism,8,14 June 2016,"The South has had a tainted history, and it dates back at the pre-Civil War era when many African Americans fell victim to slavery and unsettling maltreatment. Even after slavery was abolished, the tension between whites and blacks still lingered and to extent, still lingers today. For a film dealing with a crucial subject like racism, an inspiring script and a director with wit and smarts is a must. Steven Spielberg gives a profound treatment, thought somewhat flawed, treatment on his riveting drama based on the acclaimed novel by Alice Walker. Though it doesn't scale the tower of Spielberg's other works, especially with this being his first effort on a serious topic; it's efforts to capture the heart and adornment of the viewers prove to be successful. Set in a rural town of southern Mississippi during the 1930s when Africam Americans were bare of civil rights, the film follows Celie Johnson (played by Whoopi Goldberg), a young African Americna teenager growing up in poverty with her abusive father Albert (played by Danny Glover) who's impregnated her with a child, only to give it up for adoption. She finds some light in her tormented life with her sister Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) who lives with her for a short time, only to be exiled by Albert. For the next few decades, we follow Celiw as she struggles to discover her true identity while coping with relationships with her father's former lover Shug Avery (played by Margaret Avery) and her sister-in-law Sofia (played by Oprah Winfrey). When approached with the project, Steven Spielberg was initially skeptical about tackling this film due to his marginal knowledge of life in the Deep South. Ultimately, he changed his mind and what he brought to the screen to his brutally powerful drama granted by a performance by Whoopi Goldberg that only be described as profound, and even this feels like an understatement. She's astounding in her portrayal of the lead character, bringing her character from Alice Walker's novel to life, and the story progresses you can't help but experience concern for her character and the tyranny she endures from her father played by Danny Glover who succeeds his commitment to his cruel-hearted role. The film journeys through her life as she deals with racism, domestic abuse, incest, and a questionable relationship with her father's former lover. Spielberg handles these themes maturely and realistically, even when the film feels emotionally manipulative. These elements rarely feel forced. The depiction of the Southern culture in terms of their jazz music, spiritual lifestyle, and of course the racially charged society. The screenplay doesn't come without its flaws. While the story moves along safe standards, it tends to get a little clumsily in some places. In some sequences, the story either temporarily loses focus or feel weak, the best example lies in one scene of Celie discovering her homosexuality. Ultimately, the film overcomes its flaws through Steven Spielberg's intelligence and smart direction. The film may go on longer than necessary, clocking at 153 minutes; but overall there is plenty of more good to experience than cons. The Color Purple is both a riveting and inspiring work of art by Steven Spielberg, and boasts incredible performances by such a talented cast. Though not one of Spielberg's most memorable works, it still shows the universally acclaimed director as the brilliant mind he is. Many could debate whether or not he's handle this subject matter of racism here as maturely as he handles topics dealing with war in this other works. Nonetheless, the film strives a powerful edge.",The Color Purple
41,bobsgrock,Spielberg surprises...,8,5 May 2008,"Well, after a couple of average films with ET and Close Encounters, Steven Spielberg gives us something that to me marks this as one of his greatest achievements. Here, we see a story about real people facing real problems in the real world and their determination to overcome them. The story moves along gracefully as we see Celie, portrayed lovingly by Whoopie Goldberg, struggle with an abusive husband, surrounded by people that don't love her, and the lost relationship with her sister. At times it is rather hard to watch some of the scenes as the subject material is rather heavy and dark for the first hour, but it is well worth it in the end. To me, Spielberg is at his best when dealing with reality instead of fantasy. That's why I put this film above his alien movies. It may not be as popular or won as many awards, but it triumphs as a gripping human drama that we can all relate to in some way or another.",The Color Purple
42,Fernando-Rodrigues,"It's a loyal adaptation, but it's not so good",7,3 February 2021,"It tells the story a little bit better than the book (because we follow a chronology line here), but it lacks too much content book gives (especially, Celie and Shug's affair). That happy soundtrack also f---s all the scenes... come on, Spielberg!",The Color Purple
43,gftbiloxi,Brilliant Performances Make the Film Worthy,5,20 August 2005,"Director Steven Spielberg has the very nasty habit of undertaking deep subjects and then trivializing them with a simpering sentimentality more appropriate to a second-rate Walt Disney film than the actual subject at hand. To make matters worse, with THE COLOR PURPLE he also dumbs-down Alice Walker's brilliantly story of a depression-era black lesbian's slow and painful spiritual journey toward self-knowledge, removing as much as he dare from the story lest it offend the middle-class audience at which this film is very clearly aimed.Fortunately, THE COLOR PURPLE is remarkably blessed in its cast. Whoopi Goldberg's performance is a revelation of unexpected artistic depth, touching, funny, tough, and entirely honesty. Ophra Winfrey and Margaret Avrey are equally fine in complex supporting roles, and Hollywood's failure to make successful use of these actresses following their appearance in this film says quite a lot about the down-side of corporate film making. The power of Goldberg, Winfrey, and Avery--as well as every one in the entire cast--is such that the performers largely transcend Spielberg's ham-heavy touch to make the film memorable.The art direction is merely so-so, and I'd be willing to bet that neither Spielberg nor any of his designers actually bothered to visit the rural deep south before designing the show; the resulting look of the film is very hit and miss where authenticity is concerned. On the other hand, the cinematography is exceptionally fine and deserves a great deal of credit for making the film as enjoyable as it is. The script, as noted, is essentially a very weak adaptation of the novel, touching on but inevitably ducking the issues which made the novel so interesting. The Quincy Jones score, however, is stunning and deserves every one of the accolades heaped upon it.Watch this movie for the deeply moving performances, cinematography, and score. Then go out and buy the book. And if you've neither read the book nor seen the film, for heaven's sake DON'T read the book until you've seen the film: seeing the movie won't spoil book, but reading the book will certainly make you even more acutely aware of the film's already obvious failings.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Color Purple
44,natashabowiepinky,Proof the director can do more than just blockbusters...,7,9 January 2014,"Despite Whoopi Goldberg being a famous comedienne, she started her career off in this dramatic Spielberg film that everyone forgets about. It got 11 Oscar nominations and didn't win any of them. Now I know this is no guarantee of quality (witness Gravity's success this year) but that is a serious case of bad luck. Thankfully, the film is good enough to be worthy of it's somewhat lofty pedigree.It's all about the tragic life of a young black girl, born in the Deep South during the early 20th century. From the time she was a child, she was physically and sexually assaulted by her abusive father, and had two children courtesy of him (Both of which are taken away). Later, she is forced into marriage with a man who treats her like a domestic slave. Her only friends are her sister (Who she loses contact with soon after her wedding) and a traveling female singer with whom she has a somewhat um, intimate relationship with, for the period anyway...This is for the most part a rather depressing piece, as it relates the tale of the heroine through 30 miserable years. There are occasion chinks of light, but they're quickly snuffed out by her brute of a husband and the ever present racism back then. Only towards the end, do things start to look up. The auditions must have gone well, since every actor chosen gets under the skin of their character and never strikes a false note. Spielberg manages to involve us in the fates of all concerned, and when they experience tragedy or ecstasy, we feel it too. It's a fine film. Not sure what the title means though, despite it being explained in the movie itself... 7/10",The Color Purple
45,gab-14712,"A Powerful, Emotional Gut Punch!",9,8 July 2020,"Steven Spielberg is probably the world's most gifted storyteller. As children, he enlightened our minds and made us feel emotions in gems like E.T and Raiders of the Lost Ark. He terrified our souls with that one shark film we all know as Jaws. Up until 1985, Spielberg used science-fiction or fantasy to develop his incredible gift of storytelling. Just like any excellent filmmaker would, he made us cry tears of sadness and tears of laughter. With his first attempt at serious filmmaking, he does the same thing except within the framework of a serious topic. This movie had me grinning and bawling my eyes out. With eleven Oscar nominations (and sadly no wins) it shows that Spielberg has a hand for this kind of material. I was not expecting much, but Spielberg delivered an amazing film.The film, written by Menno Meyjes, is based off the literary classic by Alice Walker. Many people thought the story, about a young black girl suffering from men most of her life in rural Georgia, was unfilmable. The book was a series of letters from the main character, Celie. She would write to different people, but most importantly God. The book is darker than the film depicted. The movie also notches down the idea of lesbians to a simple kiss in which Spielberg defended as trying to keep his movie PG-13. Unfortunately, that does make sense. Some people complained that Spielberg and his trademark sentimental ways of storytelling made the film a happier place and time. To me, I think all that did was add heart. The film could have been utterly depressing, but Spielberg made sure there were moments of joy mixed in with all of the ugliness. On top of that, it gave the film a more of an epic scope. Those feelings mixed with the excellent cinematography skills of Allen Daviau and Quincy Jones's score gave the film that feeling.Given the subject matter, the film is an important story to tell. Even in today's society, it remains relevant and timely. Spielberg has received some backlash from people claiming, as a white man, Spielberg is not the right man to tell an African-American story. In 2020, I do not think he would touch this project. But in 1985, he treated the story with respect and with grace, and I believe that is one of the main reasons why the film continues to get amazing reviews. As director Oliver Stone mentions, Spielberg was probably the only one who could have gotten the film made. The film could have been more confusing in any other director's hands, but we all know the gift of storytelling the auteur has.The film takes place over a span of thirty years. Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg) is a tortured young woman who hasn't seen much love over the span of her young life, outside of her sister Nettie. Her incestuous father (Adolph Caesar) kept getting his daughter pregnant and giving the babies away. He eventually marries her off to the evil farmhand, Albert (Danny Glover) or ""Mister"" according to Celie. Albert abuses Celie in a horrible fashion. The turning point in Celie's life is when she meets Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), Albert's lover. Shug considers Celie really ugly at first, but she becomes more attracted to Celie as they get to know each other more. Through Shug, Celie may find that there are reasons to smile.For her screen debut, Whoopi Goldberg nailed her scenes. What a juicy role to begin your career with and she was even nominated for an Academy Award. Her character was a tortured soul, and Goldberg really pulled that off. Margaret Avery is also incredible, although I needed to warm up to her character. Danny Glover can play jerks very well as we see twice in 1985 with first Witness, now this film. Also, Oprah Winfrey! Yes, that Oprah! She plays a soul who seems to get everything she wants but goes through a complete personality change after standing up to a local white mayor. Oprah is definitely a presence!Despite some sentimental presence, prepare yourself for some heartbreak. The biggest scene to me is when Celie and Nettie are ripped apart from each other. Gosh, it felt like my soul was being shredded. The way that they have their hand games is very touching. I felt really bad for Celie with everything she has been through, but she will earn her strength. The name of the film/book comes from the beautiful purple fields and flowers. Daviau did an amazing job capturing those poignant scenes. Despite the mental torture and the beatings, there is no senseless revenge acts. This is a movie that attempts to find joy within the ugliness.The Color Purple is a straightforward drama that packs many emotional punches. This is Spielberg's most mature film. Despite the serious subject matter, we can see his trademarks. Fun trivia fact. This is one of the few films he directed that is not composed by John Williams. Anyhow, the subject matter is prevalent. Black women are often mistreated by black men, as this film shows. It's not so much of a film about race as it is about the treatment of each other within one race. This is a powerful and a must-watch.My Grade: A",The Color Purple
46,eminkl,You will absolutely forgive its faults,8,24 December 2019,"The Color Purple is Steven Spielberg's very touching and lovingly made film that captures the lives of Southern Black women in the years 1909 through 1949 and is both poignant and emotionally moving as well as sometimes disturbing. The film follows the character Celie of Whoopi Goldberg who is basically a servant and sex slave to her abusive husband (emotionally and physically) who separates her from her sister who was her pillar. Over the course of the film we see Celie develop from a terrified and tentative girl to a strong and independent woman and a passionate and persevering woman! The film is a little over 2 and a half hours but is packed with such great performances from Glover, Goldberg and Winfrey as well as the supporting cast that there is no wasted screen time and while it struggles in a few moments, makes up for it with such loving care in the way it is shot and executed that you absolutely forgive its faults.",The Color Purple
47,FilmOtaku,"Pre-""Schindler"" masterpiece",8,11 December 2003,"I have a love/hate relationship with Steven Spielberg. I love most of his films, and I hate that I do.  It would be so easy to simply discount his films as commercialized and mainstream, and some *are*, but they are almost always excellent.  That was why I was so astonished by Schindler's List when it was released  instead of sharks and superhero archaeologists, suddenly we had this incredibly profound film that was *so* well done.  Having said that, I would have been less astonished had I seen The Color Purple first.*Possible Spoilers*The Color Purple follows the tragic life of Celie (Goldberg) who has to contend with being impregnated twice by a family member, is essentially sold to a man so she can be his wife, a mother to his children from a previous marriage and resident slave and whipping post, all before the age of fifteen.  Through the years she goes from being completely beat down and oppressed to gaining a voice through the help of friends and other loved ones.  I was completely riveted while watching this film, despite its length.  The characters are so rich, and the story so full and well paced that it was impossible to get distracted, rather I wished that the film was actually longer.  There was one moment that gave me pause, when Glover's character suddenly had a change of heart, but at that point I was so enamored by the film until that then that this made me raise an eyebrow, but it was easily forgiven.  While the entire film is brilliantly executed, one particular scene to look out for is the scene when Celie is reading Nettie's letters.  The incredibly creative way that Spielberg mixes the content of the letters with Celie's surroundings is almost awe-inspiring.  The Color Purple is not an entirely feel-good film, but it is a compelling and one and masterfully done.--Shelly",The Color Purple

We can say that this motion picture has a strong anti-racist message.Despite being dramatic and touching, I don't see ""The Color Purple"" as a great movie. I personally think that the first half is much better than the second half. The first half is more sentimental, emotional and touching, while the second half is too boring.However, the best things about this movie are the beautiful sceneries and Whoopi Goldberg's performance (definitely one of her best, despite being one of her earliest roles).""The Color Purple"" is one of the few movies entirely with black people. After all, it is about black people and it shows us very well how they were so badly treated in those times (this movie takes place between 1909 and 1947).While not one of Steven Spielberg's best achievements, it isn't however one of his worst films.However, after this Steven Spielberg made plenty of more serious movies, such as ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Schindler's List"" and others.",The Color Purple

52,RossRivero99,A triumph,10,16 October 2014,"Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple a film that is based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Alice Walker is nothing short of a masterpiece. The movie is one of the only character studies I have ever seen that Spielberg has made,in fact is is the study of a young black woman named Celie Johnson (played by Whoopi Goldberg in a groundbreaking film debut.) who gets tortured, abused, and loved at the same time by friends as well as family relatives. the abusive husband in this movie is played by Danny Glover who wants to marry Celie's sister but ends up marrying Celie instead, the saddest scene in this movie is when Celie's sister gets taken away from her because of the Glover character molesting her and throwing rocks at her for no apparent reason, while watching most of the movie people hate Glover's character but by the end of the film I learned that he wasn't much of a bad person after all. The movie also has a great supporting cast which consists of Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, Margaret Avery who is one of Celie's best friends and many more unknowns. This movie goes along with some of Spielberg's best films such as Schindler's List (1993), E.T.

The film is blatantly manipulative and sentimental, wallowing in misery for about an hour and a half, then finding convenient little magical/redemptive arcs for everyone, punctuated with the usual Spielberg sap and schmaltzy score. And while I don't doubt his good intentions, I felt a little uneasy about the portrayal of African-Americans, which comes dangerously close to caricature at times. But I must say I was relatively engaged throughout, and invested in Celia's struggles. Schmaltz and sap can sometimes be effective, and I confess to getting a little choked up at times.

54,jhaggardjr,Spielberg's first drama,10,27 January 2002,"Steven Spielberg wanted to win an Oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics (he was nominated for three of them: ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"". So he decided to get very serious by directing ""The Color Purple"", a period film with no special effects. Spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie. But the Academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give Spielberg any respect. ""The Color Purple"" received 11 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, but Spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't nominated for Best Director. It got worse on Oscar night when this film didn't win a single Oscar. It got completely shut out. That wasn't right. ""The Color Purple"" should have won a couple of Oscars including one for Whoopi Goldberg's spectacular film debut as Celie, a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband (frightfully placed by Danny Glover), then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends. Oprah Winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as Sofia, one of those friends' of Celie. Since I'm from Chicago, I had already known Winfrey from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide). Like Goldberg, what a film debut! Margaret Avery is terrific as Shug Avery, another friend who also happens to be the mistress of Celie's rotten husband. All three actresses received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their work here (Goldberg for Best Actress; Winfrey and Avery for Best Supporting Actress). Set in the south during the first half of the 20th Century, ""The Color Purple"" is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end. It also made me laugh at times too. Why Academy voters were so hard on not nominating Spielberg for Best Director is a mystery that still puzzles me today. But Spielberg would eventully go on to win two Oscars years later for ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", making him one of the best movie directors of all-time. But he should have gotten nominated for this movie. The job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like ""E.T."" to a serious drama like ""The Color Purple"" was remarkable.

55,steiner-sam,Good movie despite Steven Spielberg,7,17 July 2021,"It begins in 1909 in Georgia and continues into the late 1930s. It tells of the coming-to-independence of several decades of a young African-American woman who lives through poverty of spirit and incredible abuse.Celie Harris (Desreta Jackson and Whoopi Goldberg) begins as a 14-year-old girl sexually abused by her father (Leonard Jackson). She has a son and a daughter by him, and they are immediately taken from her. Her 12-year-old sister, Nettie (Akosua Busia), is more conventionally pretty, and Celie fears what will happen to her. An older recent widower, Albert Johnson (Danny Glover), wants to marry Nettie but accepts Celie at her father's insistence.Albert, known throughout as ""Mister"" by Celie, is a brutal man who has passion only for his mistress, Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), a jazz singer whose father, Samuel (Carl Anderson), is the local minister. Celie becomes extremely submissive to avoid being beaten by Albert. When Nettie flees her father and comes to Albert and Celie, ""Mister"" tries to take advantage of her and throws her off the property when she resists. Celie and Nettie promise to write to each other, but Celie believes Nettie has died because she never receives a letter.A parallel story is that of Albert's son, Harpo (Willard Pugh), and his wife, Sofia (Oprah Winfrey). Harpo is not as brutal, and Sofia has a strong personality that dominates Harpo to Albert's disgust. Harpo and Sofia start a ""juke joint"" in the countryside where Shug sings. However, Sofia has a run-in with the mayor, after which she spends significant time in prison, which appears to break her spirit.Shug leaves Georgia for a time and returns a few years later with a new husband. While staying with Albert and Celie, Shug and Celie develop a close relationship. Celie also learns that Albert has been hiding letters from Nettie, who now lives in Africa, helping to care for the children of missionaries. These children are actually Celie's missing son and daughter.Through her relationship with Shug, Celie finally talks back to Albert and leaves with Shug, her husband, and Harpo's second wife. As the film rapidly closes, we learn how Celie finds new life, Shug reconciles with her husband, and Albert appears to come to his own epiphany.This is a very emotionally moving film, with wonderful performances by Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, and Oprah Winfrey. Danny Glover plays a brutal man well. Unfortunately, there is some distraction because Steven Spielberg cannot avoid making an epic film. Sometimes the scenery does not match the reality of the life experience. Sometimes almost slapstick humor subtracts from the grim storyline. Some of the scenes in Africa are over-the-top static.

In only my second viewing of this movie,I was once again in awe of how wonderful the acting is and how well the story is told through both words and very real emotion.Goldberg and Winfrey had never,ever,been in a movie before,so Spielberg casting them in these very important roles was a great gamble on his part. Then again he had a bit of help from Quincy Jones. In only her first role Golberg triumphs beyond anyone expectations,be they little or great. Winfrey almost steals the show with her incredible performance as well.Another big surprise is Danny Glover's portrayal of an abusive,daddy's boy,who,like the men of his time,treats women like property.

59,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Well done Mr. Spielberg!,7,19 June 2008,"Steven Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic, D.W. Griffith-inspired approach to filming Alice Walker's novel. His tactics made the film controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of Spielberg's decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable--from the exhilarating and eye-popping opening shots of children playing in paradisaical purple fields to the way he conveys the brutality of a rape by showing hanging leather belts banging against the head of the shaking bed. In a way it's a shame that Whoopi Goldberg, a stage monologist who made her screen debut in this movie, went on to become so famous, because it was, in part, her unfamiliarity that made her understated performance as Celie so effective. (This may be the first and last time that the adjective understated can be applied to Goldberg.) Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and actress (supporting players Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery were also nominated), it was quite a scandal--and a crushing blow to Spielberg--when it won none.",The Color Purple
60,Pookyiscute,"It's long. Very, very long. And, depressing.",4,8 April 2006,"I'm on the one hand, quite surprised at the amount of attention that this film received back in the day, when it first came out. It's a piece, that some may call powerful, however I found it depressing, sad and way too long, to hold anyone's attention. It continued to drag on and on, and just when you think the story can't get any worse (depressing wise), it does. Whoopie Goldburg, leads the cast of a few notable actors, in this period piece, set in the south from the 1920's, through the 1950's. A young girl who is raped and impregnated at the beginning of the film, by her father twice, is forced to give both babies up for adoption at only 13 years old. Her sister, and she live alone with their father after their mother dies, and within only a few months after her second child is born, her father gives her away in marriage to a man, at least twenty years her senior. She is treated with nothing but beatings, slander and worthlessness. And, after her sister is literally ripped away from her at fourteen, she is for the rest of the film, alone with no one who loves or cares for her. For approximately three decades we follow her through her struggle, and reality that she must face as her life, day to day, and it is painful at times to realize, that this is someone's life. Her only comfort in life, is her husband's mistress, who she falls for herself, in her own confusion of who she is and who really loves her in the world. Although it was an interesting story and certainly poignant, and touching, I don't know if two and a half hours of it, is good for the mind. It really does bring you down, and is not uplifting in the least bit. The last two minutes of the film are certainly the best, and I enjoyed those two minutes the most of the whole film, however I don't know if I would recommend watching the whole movie just to get to those last two minutes.Whoopie Goldburg was excellent, and probably the best performance of her lifetime, and I can see why she was nominated, but not why she didn't receive the Oscar.Again, it's good, but not one that is up there on my ""best list"".

62,antagonist117,Spielberg is not the right person to tell this worthy story about female friendships,6,2 November 2014,"Characters in Spielberg movies can operate in the middle of the moral spectrum, can exhibit nuance, and can hold true to their immutable natures while still going on a journey of change—see, for example, Chief Brody in ""Jaws""—but it is more common for them to be characterized in extremes, as most of them are in ""The Color Purple."" Shining heroes and devilish villains are not out of place in, say, Indiana Jones movies, which trade in concepts of good and evil in a world where magic is real and the stakes include the destruction of the world, but in Spielberg's historical films his black and white view of life can feel stifling, arbitrary, and preachy. In ""The Color Purple"" and in ""Schindler's List"" no less than in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" the story unfolds through a series of good and evil actions committed by characters who are either right or wrong, respectively. To be fair, Oskar Schindler is a flawed hero in the latter movie, and in this film Celie Harris Johnson (Whoopie Goldberg) has one line that suggests complication. This moment occurs early in the movie, when she suggests, perhaps for lack of any other example of male behavior, that a man beat his wife in order to make her more docile. But for the most part, Celie and the other characters in ""The Color Purple"" have at most two settings, and when they alternate between them it is with a rapidity that is more in service of plot and message than of truth. Spielberg is not obliged to make truthful movies, of course, but in his historical movies he seems to want to have it both ways: he seems to want to say something honest and meaningful, but through characters who are too idealized and abstractified to connect with.Here, the film opens with an idyllic pastoral scene: young girls playing in a field of flowers. When they step out of the head-high stalks, we see that one of the girls, Celie, is pregnant. Clearly, something is amiss. The next two scenes reveal Celie's painful childbirth, the cruel theft of the infant by her father, and the statement that her father is also the father of her child. The moral lines are very stark, the villain and victim very clear. If only real life had the perfect clarity that it has in Spielberg's versions of it.At times, of course, it does. There have been, and still are, women like Celie (Whoopie Goldberg), abused and despised and trapped by their deranged fathers or husbands. There have been, and still are, women like Sofia (Oprah Winfrey), unjustly imprisoned or mistreated by their employers because of the color of their skin. But do people bear their circumstances with the saintly, childlike, often bemused patience of Celie, or alternate between Sofia's polar extremes of unbridled confidence and utterly defeated resignation? Some perhaps do, but for most people, life is lived in the middle. There are monsters in the world, like Danny Glover's tyrannical Albert, but do monsters like that ever change in time for a Spielberg-sanctioned happy ending? These characters are simple when they should be rich, and mercurial when they should be static.That said, if Spielberg's prime objective is to convey a strong, positive message through raw, uplifting emotion, he succeeds. Many have focused on the film's famous march to a church, a big musical number that feels good and creates a neat resolution for a juke joint singer named Shug (Margaret Avery). Yet this is actually a side plot, and not strictly necessary to the core ideas about strong female relationships. In fact, it works against those ideas: Shug is the film's most complicated and interesting on-screen character (an equally intriguing storyline set in Africa exists only on the margins), but in the church she is railroaded into what audiences in 1985 found a crowd-pleasing conformity that, to me, just feels like conformity. The idea that really drives ""The Color Purple,"" and that remains as daring and intense and uncompromising and subversive now as it was then, is that bonds between women have the ability to weather the destructive power that certain men employ to maintain their position of privilege in society. Celie's different but equally strong connections with Sofia, Shug, and a sister who remade herself in Africa are mutually empowering and healing, and the worthiness of this message makes the film worth seeing and talking about in spite of its many missteps.",The Color Purple

Spielberg, in typical Spielberg fashion, overdoes things at some points; and you have to question if certain things would really happen that way in real life.  It seemed like he was just looking for more ways to make the audience cry.  Looking at it now that I'm older, I can't help but question Spielberg's involvement in this film.....could he have been truly sensitive and geniune to the plight of Blacks, being that he's white?  It does seem kinda odd....but considering the subject matter he made one hell of a movie.

66,ScottAmundsen,Spielberg's Great Oscar Snub,10,18 November 2012,"One of the things the magnificent film THE COLOR PURPLE will go down in history for is that the Academy, while giving the film ELEVEN Oscar nominations in every category from both Lead Actress and Supporting Actress to screenplay to score to cinematography and even Best Picture, but failed to give a nod to director Steven Spielberg despite the fact that this film was his masterpiece up to that time. And the snub was compounded when the film did not win a single award on Oscar night.And all this, while interesting enough, is rather a pity, because while prizes are nice, what matters is the film. And this was indeed Spielberg's finest work up to that time.Menno Meyes's screenplay is a masterful adaptation of Alice Walker's epistolary novel. Perhaps the most striking thing about it is that Meyes kept the epistolary form as a way of driving the plot forward. Most of the letters are read in voice over by Desreta Jackson and later Whoopi Goldberg as Celie, and Akosua Busia as Celie's beloved sister Nettie, the only person in the world who loves her and from whom she is cruelly separated by Albert Johnson, a man she is forced to marry by her father. Celie's father is himself a cruel man who raped Celie repeatedly and fathered two children by her before she was fourteen years old. Her father took the babies away and Celie never saw them againThe sweeping narrative covers Celie's life over the course of some thirty years and encompasses all the people in it. Trapped in an arranged marriage with a man who loves another woman, Celie realizes early on that she has been married off as nothing more than a domestic servant with benefits (for the husband). She seeks solace in religion, having no other outlet for her feelings.Then one day the woman her husband loves shows up at her door: one Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), a singer with a reputation for loose morals (somewhat justified) whose father is pastor of a nearby church and from whom she is estranged. Shug's first words to Celie have gone down in film history: ""You sho' is ugly!"" But that changes soon. When Shug arrives she is not well, and Celie cares for her. A bond soon develops between the two women that eventually becomes a love affair. Spielberg came under some criticism for his handling of the Lesbian affair; it is much more explicit in the book, but while he soft-pedals it in the movie, it's clearly there.Meanwhile Sofia (Oprah Winfrey in a performance that has made me wish she had done more acting), Mister's daughter-in-law, runs afoul of the town mayor and is sentenced to a prison term followed by involuntary servitude as maid to the Mayor's wife, a shrill and unpleasant creature who plays at Lady Bountiful where the ""coloreds"" are concerned but whose own true colors come to the surface all too soon.I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. I've loved it since the very first time and it never seems to get old. Spielberg would, of course, top this one with his masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST eight years later (and finally get the Oscar recognition that he had been denied for so many years), but for those eight years this was his unqualified best film, a great adaptation of a great novel that not only did justice to the source material but provided entertainment value as well.

68,Punk19,One of Spielburg's most inspirational,10,30 June 2007,"Before I get to far into this review I need to give a few details from the novel, which was titled the same as the film. The novel tells a story from a number of diary entrées about a young girl named Celie, who is constantly abused and neglected, who lived in the 1920's and 1930's. Written by Alice Walker in 1982, it has become her most recognized work.The film follows the growing up of a woman that lived in the Southern United States, the girl's name is Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). Celie, 14 at the time that the film starts, has already had two children by her father, yes you read it right, and has already been subjected to the cruelty of her father. Celie's father forces Celie to marry a man that she calls ""Mister"", his real name is Albert (Danny Glover). Albert, who had his eyes on Celie's younger more, attractive sister named Nettie (Akosua Busia), treats Celie like a slave (making her clean the disorderly house, take care of the unruly children and so forth). He beats her often, making Celie go mute (for fear of being beaten for talking) and causing her to go into complete submission.Now Celie's sister comes to live with them and wouldn't you know it, Albery tries to rape her. She kicks him away too many times and he kicks her out. A few years later, Celie is a grown woman and has spent a good number of days crying in fear of her abusive husband. Albert is now spending time with his mistress, a jazz singer named Shug ""Sugar"" Avery (Margaret Avery). At first Celie and Shug don't get along, then they start having a friendly relationship that begins to drive Albert crazy.Shug hasn't been living the life of leisure, in her mind that is. Her father, the reverend, has completely removed her from his life because he regards her as a slut. In another part of town, one of Albert's sons is having trouble with his wife Sophie (Oprah Winfrey). Sophie has also lived a hard life were the men try to make her feel inferior. She is strong-spirited and doesn't like to be hit. Harpo (Willard Pugh), the son of Albert, gets advice from Albert and hits Sophie. She leaves him, but her freedom is short lived, she hits the mayor and spends some time in jail. After eight years, she is commissioned to be the Mayor's wife's maid for twelve long years.To make a long review look shorter, Shug helps Celie find the long lost letters from her sister, she had thought her sister dead, and she succeeds in convincing Celie to leave Albert. After a few years Celie is reunited with her sister and her two children that had been raised in Africa.Beautifully portrayed and enhanced, the film shows what happened during the 1920's and 1930's. It gives an example to how women, mostly black women, lived during the time that women's right's weren't yet realized. I gave this a perfect ten our of ten, one of my family's personal favorites.",The Color Purple
69,DanB-4,Worthy of all 11 Oscars,10,21 September 1999,"There is so much to love about The Color Purple, one knows barely where to begin. The film tells the story essentially of 3 women, Celie, Shug and Sophia and how they grow and change as their lives progress. Celie quietly accepts her lowly lot in life, Sophia is burdened by hers and Shug is just desperately trying to find out who she is.Brilliantly acted and gorgeous to watch, The Color Purple will stir emotions and shed tears in the hardest of hearts. It draws you into a world in only a way great films do (like the way The Godfather brings you on the inside) and lets you get to know characters.It's 0-for-11 Oscar performance and rejection of Speilberg for even a nomination is still to this day, and always will be, Oscar's greatest scandal. For me, this still taints the entire process. It deserved of at least the awards for actress, supporting actress (Margaret Avery, not Oprah) and cinematography. But that is point that has been beaten to death for nearly 15 years.This is a story of faith and redemption, rather than despair and defeat. It is a long, powerful, meritorious film - get an extra large bowl of popcorn and a fresh box of kleenex and take 150 minutes of your life for this movie. It was easily the best film of 1985 and is one of the best ever made.

71,Don-102,"Spielberg's 1st ""Serious"" Film Is Beautiful and Powerful...",10,28 March 1999,"A film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. The fact is, Steven Spielberg, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years. THE COLOR PURPLE, at the time, was considered risky, especially after action classics like JAWS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for Spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare. It is quite an entrance. No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by Alice Walker. One surprise is how Spielberg could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south. Slavery is gone, but in the south depicted here, it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves. Spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. It is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens. EMPIRE OF THE SUN, ALWAYS, SCHINDLER'S LIST, etc.. His awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because A) he uses mostly untrained, first-time actors, B) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen, and C) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years. It is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single Academy Award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult.Whoopi Goldberg is fabulous as the tortured Celie, an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive Danny Glover, who she only knows as ""Mister"". The film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with ""Mister"". The PG-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the Walker novel. This is not ""The Burning Bed"" in Georgia by any means. There is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected. It happens gracefully. Goldberg perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it. The films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when Goldberg and her sister, Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) are separated, maybe forever. (Possibly foreshadowing Holocaust separation of child and parent?) You may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence.The color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people. There really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all. Spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.RATING: 10 of 10",The Color Purple

Although she had two babies, they were sent to the church. Her husband Albert treated her as a home maid. More heart-breaking was her sister Nettie was forced to leave her. As a helpless child, Celie could do nothing but resigned herself to fate. Luckily she got the help from Shug. She became self-confident and independent. In the end she left Albert and started her new life. More happier was Nettie came back to meet her with Celie's two children.There were many touching moments in the movie. One of them was Shug sang excitingly the gospel song and reconciled with her father. Their hug was such a touching moment.Whoopi Goldberg convincingly played the sympathizing Celie. Steven Spielberg directed many blockbusters. Maybe he is the most successful commercial director in Hollywood.

73,IcyTones,"""I's Married Now""",5,8 July 2020,"Movies like this are very emotive & force you to confront your own attitudes towards the social convention issues presented in the movie - regardless of the historical period, modern thought or future implications.The part of this movie that I find fascinating as well as funny, is the part where 'Shug Avery' returns to Celie and Mister's home with her new husband, Grady. Oh the excitement of having two married ladies in one household is such an important step in the right direction for Shug that she can hardly contain herself....And when the reverend - who turns out to be Shug's father passes Mister's house, he really does pass by in disgust of seeing his wayward daughter. This is such a big let-down for Shug as she retorts, shows off her ring & presents herself as ""I's Married Now"" - ""I's Married' - as if that makes everything all right, but she was totally ignored.I love those two scenes which are in the same segment. Why? Because it's unbelievably difficult to imagine that back then older unmarried women with no kids had no stability, no status & no source of income. The only way out was marriage. That's not to say that women weren't allowed to earn their own money, but marriage put a 'worthy' 'spin' to the domesticity of a woman's life or lot. Without benefit of marriage, women were society's rejects. The only thing that gave women a real sense of importance was the marital status of being married - even if the two men in your life, your husband and your lover are trash talking about you in the next room - in front of 'the children' - as was the case with Mister & Grady.What I also like about that segment or 'Act' as the theatres would call it, is, upon Shug & Grady's arrival, it's the only time you see Celie & Mister put on a united front to show that they 'both got colds'.I guess because Celie was taken up with reading all her sister's letters, and the guys were 'partying' all the time, Celie never did take the driving lessons that Shug promised her, & we never got to see the car again or where it was kept, until Shug & Grady were ready to leave.",The Color Purple

The story begins from the year 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. She has given birth two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. A widower lays his eyes on Nettie but their father gives Celie to him. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling. Women are inferior of men and especially being an African-American woman their rights are less than a zero. Celie's story is a true survival story.""The Color Purple"" is a master-piece and underestimated film of Spielberg. He should make more drama which ""The Color Purple"" and ""Schindler's List"" are good notion.The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as Celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty ""Mister"". I have never seen him in a such an evil role. The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia.Warning!

What saves this film from being just depressing are a great script, tight editing, but most of all the outstanding performances of Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. I can't resist inserting here that I think Whoopi Goldberg is STILL underrated, and that she belongs among the very greatest of the generation.

It deals with issues most people have a hard time facing. That is precisely why Spielberg is one of my favorites, because of the level of integrity in his work. The situations that he brought to the service in this film, ugly as some of them were, are reminiscent of that time period. We don't like to see our ancestors in such a hideous depiction because it's like holding up a mirror to humanity and saying, ""Take a good look at who you really are"". I like films that disturb our senses and strip away arrogance and false pride. I like films that say ""It wasn't always great to be an American, but whatever we went through, we're still here. We're not dead yet."" Whether Spielberg gives that voice to difference sexes, races or species, I think it is a message that needs to be heard again and again, because that it where our sense of pride can come from. Not from a false idea of who we were.Beyond the moral issues of this film, the cinematography was wonderful. The luscious landscapes of purple flowers and verdant feels was enough to take my breath away. The performances were just as wonderful. Whoopi Goldberg's film debut proved her ability as a future top-notch actress. Danny Glover, who gave his usual intense and mind-bending performance, also stole the show as well as actresses Avery Brooks, Oprah Winfrey and Rae Dawn Chong.

77,I_Love_Spielberg,A flawlessly-made film.,10,20 May 2008,"Spielberg's first dramatic film is no let-down. It's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all movies that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an African-American director.What I love about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book. Furthermore, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually, he's just himself throughout most of his movies. But in this, he completely branches out and is someone else for once. But, the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is excellent as Celie. You will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie.Now, I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as this one is, because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed.",The Color Purple

And I'm not knocking 'Out of Africa' (which won in '85) either; but it was, to my mind, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big cryer.Maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; Danny Glover, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah.The rest is history; but, at the time: who knew?",The Color Purple

Let's say, Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan, even Minority Report, Munich, War Horse and Lincoln, stories that deal with deeper and darker subject matter. Roger Ebert's review for this movie is one of my favourites, ""I am not female, I am not black, I am not Celie, but for a time during ""The Color Purple,"" my mind deceives me that I am all of those things, and as I empathize with her struggle and victory I learn something about what it must have been like to be her.

80,tml_pohlak_13,A different Spielberg film...,6,8 May 2009,"WARNING! THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS! READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK!The first half hour of The Color Purple is extremely flimsy, plot-wise. There is only one interesting situation in that time, when Mister (Danny Glover) attempts to rape Nettie The plot picks up at last right before Whoopi Goldberg takes over as Celie, who has until now been played by a rather un-likable, amateurish actress. Here is the scene that kicks this huge improvement off: as young Celie prepares to shave Mister, he tells her he will kill her if she cuts him. Suddenly, she becomes terrified, and extremely uncomfortable close-ups of the razor going across Mister's neck are employed to their maximum potential.From then on, the plot constantly skyrockets further, except for one bit. After escaping from a fight in the local ""juke-joint"", Celie and a character named Shug have a woman-to-woman moment. Now, I'm not a big fan of such ""girly"" (as I like to call them) scenes. All of a sudden, to my alarm, Shug began to kiss Celie, and a few shots suggest just what goes on off-screen. I was rather alarmed. This movie's plot had plenty of promise by now: was it going to degenerate into a miserable lesbian romance film, when I was most interested in Celie's relationship with her abusive husband, Mister? Luckily, it did not linger on this for long. Spielberg admitted in an interview he regretted toning down the lesbian romance from the original novel, but I think this was a good choice: after wasting enough time, we get back to what we're really interested in, and that's the central conflict between Celie and Mister.(By the way, the author of the novel, Alice Walker, initially was displeased at the adaptation. After an enthusiastic audience reaction at premiere, however, she changed her mind and loved it. Curious, don't you think?)Whoever knew that Whoopi Goldberg, whom I've known mainly for her comedy roles, is such a great serious actress? This marks her film debut, and certainly remains among the finest debuts in film history. I'm not a fan of Oprah Winfrey, either, but here, she does quite a fantastic job as Sofia, a rather hefty woman full of confidence. (The two characters are powerfully contrasted—Celie overcomes her abusive husband and the way the world has treated her; Sofia is arrested for an altercation with the Mayor, and after brutal beatings in jail, she emerges with her spirit completely crushed, ending up as a maid to the woman whose job offer led to the arrest in the first place.) Danny Glover proves to be a great villain in this film.However, for all its charms, The Color Purple is a deeply flawed film. After refusing Mister's sexual advances, Nettie is thrown off his land. She and Celie, however, hold onto each other, refusing to let go. Very touching at first, but the scene dragged on and on and on, and I finally got really bored of the whole ""You-can't-separate-us"" moment. Here is perhaps the reason I disliked the first half-hour of the film: the black people are portrayed in a far-from flattering way. The women are treated as commodities (when asking Celie's father permission to marry Nettie, Mister's request is denied, but he is offered Celie instead. He admits he hasn't noticed how she looks like, and so, Celie parades herself in front of him. They get married.). They are also brutally abused for minor things. But after that initial half-hour, we begin to see into these male characters and their motivations: Mister has a father he's afraid to say ""No"" to; he wants to please him desperately, etc. But here is the film's ultimate flaw: the women are all portrayed as free-spirited, overcoming all the difficulties the world throws at them eventually. But the men are shown as pushovers, weaklings, or to put it bluntly, losers. And another thing: I refuse to believe that black characters who read Oliver Twist would use phrases such as ""I is"". It just doesn't work.As for the music— dear LORD. Quincy Jones' music is awful. When Celie reads her sister's letters, it should be HER moment. But Jones' music just ruins the entire effect of the scene. (The one exception is the spirited, lively gospel song near the end of the film.)But Steven Spielberg proves more than ever his directing capabilities. His masterful intercutting makes the boring task of reading letters into a true cinematic experience. Celie sneaks a letter into her Missal and reads it during the church service. The congregation fades away—except for Celie, who remains, quietly reading. Cut to the front of the church, which is suddenly ploughed through by a bulldozer, which is exactly what was going on in the letter, set in Africa. It's that kind of cutting that makes the movie so much more exciting. This technique culminates in one of the later scenes, as Celie is about to cut Mister's throat while shaving him. Spielberg cuts from her preparing to kill him to Shug running to stop her to an African sacrificial ritual. The resulting tension is overwhelming. And of course, what other director but Spielberg could make a mailbox into a character with mere camera movement?Overall, The Color Purple is very entertaining. It was quite publicly snubbed at the '86 Oscars, grabbing 11 nominations, and winning zero. I give it a thumbs up—good? Yes. But far from a masterpiece.",The Color Purple
81,dwr246,Flawless Adaptation of the Book,10,31 March 2005,"Turning a book into a successful screenplay is an elusive art. Those wishing to do so would do well to study this movie, which turns a wonderful novel into an equally wonderful movie.The story concerns a black woman named Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). We follow Celie's life from the age of 14 to middle age, and it is a tough life. We start out with Celie's molestation at the hands of her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father. Her mother dies, and when her stepfather decides to remarry, Celie and her sister, Nettie (Akosia Busua), are no longer welcome in the house. Celie is old enough to be married off to Albert (Danny Glover), an abusive widower with equally abusive children. When Nettie rejects Albert's advances, he throws her out of his house, and keeps the sisters separate, even hiding Nettie's letters to Celie. But Celie manages to cope with the situation, creating order out of the chaos that Albert's house had become, helping his children and their neighbors, and earning such respect as a woman could earn in that community. She graciously welcomes Albert's mistress, singer Shug Avery (Margaret Avery), when he brings her to the house. Unexpectedly, the women become friends, and with Shug's help, Celie turns the tables on Albert, ultimately getting her life - and her sister - back.The acting is uniformly strong. Goldberg turns in a performance worthy of the critical acclaim it received. Glover plays Albert to perfection, even showing his vulnerability at the end of the film. Oprah Winfrey does an excellent job as the volatile Sofia. Avery's Shug is full of love and compassion. Rae Dawn Chong makes Squeak a multi-dimensional woman, whom you want to see succeed. The characters all become real, and we care about them and their concerns.Perhaps the greatest strength of the film is its taking a novel in epistolary form, and turning it into a running narrative. No small feat. The story is woven seamlessly, and is compelling as we follow it.An absolute classic of a movie, well worth repeated viewings.",The Color Purple
82,MickeyTo,One of the BEST FILMS EVER!,10,14 March 2000,"Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice Walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy.  When first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women.This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century.  She has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth.  Her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister.Celie (played in later years by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married off to an abusive husband (Danny Glover).  The husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from Celie's life.The story is often heartbreaking as Celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children.  Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters, including Sophia, a tough as nails wife to her step son, and Shug, a loud and luscious saloon singer, who teaches her a thing or two about love.Speilberg's direction is all over this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances.  I dare you to watch this film and not be moved! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story.  While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of Alice Walker to shine through.I couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film. Suffice it to say, however, this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again, and which has left an indelible mark on me.",The Color Purple

I remember upon studying the novel at A level, being shocked at the level of violence that women like Celie had to endure. I was very glad that the film didn't water this down. To have done so would be a grave insult to the women worldwide who had to suffer this treatment.Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut in the Color Purple and she was great in her role as the grown-up Celie.

84,padiyark,A tribute to African american women,9,21 January 2002,"I remember when this film was up for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category.  For the life of me, I cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing I can say:  It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit.Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman.  There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with.  Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption.  Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie.  Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film. 
And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent ""Beloved"" did.  I encourage anyone of any race to see this film.  9/10",The Color Purple
85,HollisWoods,A Tale of Sisterhood & Women Empowerment,10,5 April 2021,"Stephen Spielberg is objectively one of the greatest film makers of all time. With pop culture classics like Indiana Jones and ET, to beautiful and powerful drama pieces like Schindler's List. This is a man who knows how to make a movie, and the Color Purple is ""one more chalk on his board,"" or whatever the saying is. It's a film with a heartwarming story, amazing acting, and excellent cinematography. I watched it once, and it immediately became one of my favorite films of all time.The Color Purple was a story of sisterhood, and the actual color purple was a symbol of that. We meet our main character, Celie, playing in a field of purple flowers with her sister Nettie. When the sisters are torn apart, the sky is filled with ominous purple clouds. Then after many years not knowing whether her sister was dead or alive, she finally got her hands on one of Nettie's letters, and as she read the letter the room had soft touches of purple on Celie's dress, the drapes, and even the lighting. When the sisters finally reunite after many years, not only are they both wearing purple, but they reunite in the same field of purple flowers we meet them.While it's a tale of two sisters at it's core, there's some much more to Celie's story to not only make you feel emotional, but also empowered. This film is fueled by it's strong female characters and it's theme of women empowerment. During these times, women were property and often abused the way Celie was. Yet the leading ladies here overcome that and really prove they are more. Nettie is well educated and fights for what she believes in. Shug Avery is living large and living freely. Sofia is not afraid to stand up for herself and will literally punch a person if it comes down to it.These strong female influences are what Celie needed. Celie was abused mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually for so long, by both her father and husband. She had no idea how to fight back and felt too worthless to even try. But we see that men never made her feel special. She had Nettie, who was the only one that loved her. Then Shug Avery came and rocked Celie's world. Shug was the first person since Nettie who had a true emotional connection with her. She made her feel loved and helped her become more confident and stronger in who she is.Thanks to these powerful influences, we find Celie at the end of the film as an independent woman, home owner, and business owner. Celie is not only the definition of a dynamic character, but she is also the definition of perseverance and woman empowerment. Her happy ending was well deserved and most satisfying.Not that I was there, nor am I African American either, but it seems African American culture in these times were depicted pretty accurately, in the way that they lived, hung out together, and talked. And while racism wasn't the focal theme of this brilliantly written story, it's very much there as it was in real life. We see it most with Sofia. All she did was speak against a white lady and punched her white husband, and ended up in jail for like 8 years. Systematic Racism right there. Sofia was such a strong headed woman. This experience knocked her down, but then she regains her spirit toward the end of the film; a satisfying end to her arc.That scene where Sofia is surrounded by angry white people was both powerful because of what it symbolized, but also because of the acting. While I'm at it - The Acting in the Color Purple is literally supreme. Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Akosua Busia, Desreta Jackson - I'm talking directly to all of you. I want to thank you and congratulate you on these brilliant performances. You made the film feel so real, so raw, so emotional, so powerful. It was Cinema at it's finest. Spielberg sure knows how to perfectly cast a movie.I do this weird thing that if the acting is really good, I'll smile, even if the scene itself is dark and inhumane. I want to leave a list of scenes that just stood out to me the most, because no words can begin to describe the quality of the acting, directing, and writing that will make me come back to this movie again and again:Sisters separated, Shug's song to Celie, Celie smiling, Sofia's downfall, Christmas reunion, reading the letter, The Final Supper, the Reunion.While Albert is a horrible person, you can tell he is very very miserable with his life. And thanks to scenes with his dad, we can see that he became the man his father wanted him to be. But when Shug reconciles with her father, she say ""sinners got soul too."" And this is immediately followed by Albert helping Celie's family return home. After everything he's done, there's no chance of redemption for him, and he'll be trapped in the external and internal turmoil he put himself in.But doing one good thing for someone he tormented for so long - that must've given him tremendous inner peace. If he did one thing right, it was this, and he knows it meant literally everything to Celie. As Celie reunites, we see all her friends watch with tears of joy, because they too want Celie to find the happiness she deserved after everything she's been through.To end the review, I want to highlight the moment I found most inspirational: Albert tells Celie she's not going to make it in life because she's poor, black, ugly, and a woman. Her response was ""I am here."" If that's not the definition of powerful, I don't know what is.",The Color Purple
86,nifabs,I think it p***es GOD off,10,5 June 2003,"""If you pass by The Color Purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it""
This means(as I see it) that we can't afford to take for granted ;the simple beautiful truths of life.  We can't pretend that time never changes things, situations and people.  We need to release the spirits within, the voices of our soul and notice ""the color purple"".I won't spoil the pleasure for those who haven't seen this movie but I come away each time I see this movie with a deeper respect for the stoic enduring spirit of women, mothers,sisters, wives and daughters.It takes depth of personality/heart to truly move beyond suffering to a newer glory.Whoopi Goldberg is incandescent in her first starring role which remains her best till date.

87,les6969,Should have won at least a few Oscars,9,24 February 2010,"It is amazing that this film ( though nominated for 11 ) did not win any Oscars and Mr Spielberg was not even nominated for Best Director. This is a film about a young girl dealing with abuse who tries to find love and family. The fact that the characters are black is secondary but also educates those who are ignorant of just how bad things were for blacks in the south, not just because of racism but because of the problems that the community itself chose to ignore. Incest is a strong subject for any film to cover but Mr S does it brilliantly in a way that moves all the right emotions in us.Danny Glover plays his role perfectly,Whoopi Goldberg shines out as the main character and has never really repeated her performance in any film since,Oprah Winfrey is amazingly good and deserved an Oscar, Margaret Avery,Adolph Caesar, Laurence Fishburne,Rae Dawn Chong,Akosua Busia,Desreta Jackson, Willard Pugh,Leonard Jackson,Carl Anderson,and other cast members all did a fine job and each character comes to life.So why was this film snubbed by the film academy?

88,thomasmitilis1995,"I'M POOR, BLACK, I MAY EVEN BE UGLY, BUT DEAR GOD, I'M HERE! I'M HERE!",7,5 June 2020,"PROS:
~Whoopi Goldberg portrays brilliantly Celie, a human being who needs and deserves love. Celie is a woman with a lost identity followed by her defiance in reclaiming the life she lost. Through her character the film depicts the problems of sexism, oppression and systematic abuse. The song of Shug for her or when she dresses like her are a few moments of happiness through a harsh and unfair world. For all these reasons, you root for her when she stands up against Albert.
~The first act of the movie is the best part of the film despite the rough scenes. We see through a couple scenes a woman who is raped and impergrated by her father, gives birth in a dirty barn, forced to marry an older man that constanly beats her and uses her as his slave by cooking and providing for his children. The separation between the sisters is a heartrending moment and makes their reunification in the end emotionally touching.
~The rest of the cast is fantastic. Donald Glover as the cruel husband, Albert is awesome and you feel disguise for him because he treats his wife like property. Oprah Winfrey gives a powerful performance as Sofia and you feel her pain when she is treated like garbage and doesn't even have the time to be with her children in Christmas. Margaret Avery as Shug is a woman who is an inspiration to Celie and shows that a sinner can have a soul too.
~Spielberg challenged himself here after his successful blockbusters and his direction is subtle and beautiful. The transition from the sisters playing in the purple fields to the leather belt hanging in the bed is a nice way to prepare the audience for what is coming. Besides this, the music score by Quincy Jones is wonderful and enhances perfectly the dramatic tension.CONS:
~The film succumbs to many conveniences and doesn't escape from the typical holywood standards. The happy closure of Shug is poorly executed and her singing sequence in the end is awkward. Furthermore , the remorse of Albert by helping the two sisters to connect again is very unrealistic.
~Another problem of the film is its continuity. After the shocking first act and the attachment to the two sisters, the movie forgets this storyline until the end. In other worlds, you are immersed into the film because of their strong connection and suddenly the movie puts you into other subplots that don't grab you in the same level.
~The tone of the movie is incoherent in some parts and the humor doesn't work among the serious subjects. For example, the slapstick humor around the character of Harpo is unfitting and the scene with the white lady surrounding by some black men is a bit silly. Also, it is weird that the abuser is played as a joke character in some scenes.",The Color Purple
89,Essex_Rider,A masterpiece,10,27 July 2007,"This film, without a doubt, is one of Spielberg's very best films. It is a sad but achingly beautiful study of complex characters weaving a complex tale across the vivid landscape of humanity, in whatever colour. For me, this has many 'stars'. Danny Glover, so well known for his comedy pairing with Mel Gibson, portrays an evil abuser who is ultimately saved by his conscience. Oprah Winfrey as the poor women whose inner demons tear her soul apart is utterly convincing, and why she consigned herself to the queen of the talk shows is a criminal waste. But for me, the star is obviously Whoopi Goldberg. She portrays her character with real depth and understanding. Her small triumphs, so often eclipsed by her tragedies, shine through like a blinding beacon of hope. This is a classic film, complex, tragic, sometimes funny. It is Spielberg's masterpiece, and he has crafted it as surely as an old master crafts a portrait or a composer writes a piece that leaves us emotionally drained, but ultimately fulfilled.I would happily give this 10 out of 10",The Color Purple
90,jjcremin-1,One of Spielberg's Best,9,3 January 2008,"Spielberg was at the top of his game when he directed this. This did launch the careers of Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and the future talk show queen Oprah Winfrey. Alice Walker wrote the book and did give the film her blessing. Treated like a star in this but not so famous is Margaret Avery who certainly acted like a queen. There are lesbian undertones between her and Goldberg.Spielberg's visual style is actually very similar to E.T. and the Indiana Jones movies. It goes from subtle to not so subtle and the protagonist Goldberg goes through an effective arc.She goes from a poor, defenseless, sweet girl to someone who has power once she discovers the letters her daughter's been writing to her has been hidden away from Glover. She even goes through another change when she sees her African children for the first time. She is believable even if the story at times is not believable.For instance, why would Glover keep those letters with his money box? He's quite the antagonist for Goldberg for most of this and picks up the wrong lessons from his father Adolph Cesare that partially explains his behavior. Still, blacks were treated like second class citizens and black men could only take it out of black women.But one that wouldn't have any of that is Oprah Winfrey who whoops her mate Harpo. But she becomes a sad victim of her blackness after getting jailed for hitting back a white man. Hard to say what her movie career would have been like because she truly became a force onto herself on her own TV show. In a small role one finds Lawrence Fishburn, who will become a major star in his own right.Was the happy ending a dream? Avery reunites with her preacher husband with a lot of song and dance. Glover arranges for Goldberg's kids to come without them knowing more than a few words of English. But it made the viewer feel good and for me, that's good enough.",The Color Purple
91,ksaelagnulraon,Is this what passes for quality drama in America???,6,27 January 2002,"I have never read the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, but if it's anything even remotely like this film, I'm damned if I know how it even got nominated, particularly seeing as it was published in 1982.  Obviously Spielberg got the entire thing wrong: I thought SCHINDLER'S LIST was extraordinarily well done, but his first experiment outside ""pure entertainment"" could be said to be a failure.  Absolutely nothing happens in the film for the first 100 minutes - rather, things DO happen but not so you'd know.  It's always difficult to adapt a sprawling novel to a film with limited runtime, but, to me, Spielberg glosses over some very important issues near the beginning: he could have expanded these (such as the father's influence on the two girls), and left out some fairly trivial scenes through the middle and towards the end.  Again, I'm not sure how the book finished, but to climax in such a contrived ""happy ending"" is almost demeaning to the audience, who should have been sitting there for well over two hours absolutely engrossed in the on-screen drama.  Things like this simply don't happen - Whoopie Goldberg's husband, for instance, changes his personality overnight and arranges a reunion between her and her sister. Where did they get this stuff from?!!  I felt, as I was watching it, that I could never really relate to the characters: they were presented, but not explored.  Noting that Spielberg, for all his great qualities, is still a white man, one can understand this: he never had any real feel for the oppression of the characters.  The film, in fact, became more of a comedy - again, I'm not sure how the book was written but I'm sure that even if it did contain humorous notes throughout, the sheer tragedy of the situation would have come through loud and clear.  All in all, I was disappointed with this film: a great director handling a (reputedly) great story, and it fell in a heap, with only an emotive happy ending that was any good.

A young woman (girl, actually) is brutally abused and deprived. Her humbled courage and patience is tested over and over again. There is her vengeful and sadistic mother who masturbates her level of comfort through the shambles of her horrible pitiful life. There is also her robot like, seemingly indifferent cardboard kind of a grandmother and the cruel senseless garbage quality of her environment. All of it cannot crash down on her to squash her spirit. And, if all of that was not enough, she is handed an almost certain death sentence which infects the viewer with sadness, guilt and ....yes optimism. A miracle! The film presents almost nothing cinematographically new. It has the ""cookie cutter"" ""cold cuts"" of miserable/deprived/crude/ungrateful bunch of inner city kids and a kind, loving, do-good teacher. Mind you, she is a lesbian, therefore goodness gracious etc. What else is new? ""Precious"", that's what. The heavy gold persona of this huge/little girl (her mother is of lead) makes all the difference. We do love her. We sympathize, empathize, resonate with her misery, defiance, resistance and applaud her resilience and the steadiness of her soul.

There are a lot of confronting themes in this film like incest and violence so if these subjects make you uncomfortable then this isn't a good film to watch.

95,IMDBcinephile,A Wonderful Movie With Some Faults.,6,30 June 2011,"First of all, I want to commemorate Steven Spielberg for making a very picturesque backdrop to such a tragic movie; it imbues a sense that everything can be better in the circumstances as they are. However, I actually initially thought it was going to be about the slave trade, but that is a minor trifle in my train of thought as what I got was actually better.The movie opens with a beautiful orchid setting up the movie, showing you the innocence of two girls frolicking around the field (it's a rather moving moment but you know it's not going to be quite that similar throughout). Then she gives birth in 1909 to a baby, who she is deprived of from her Father, as the movie chronicles her struggle at education and how this all unfolds. The movie deviates slightly from the book, with Spielberg's need for audience warmth I suppose, but he does do very well with the plotting. Even with the scenes intercutting with the reading of those letters from her sister Nettie...Danny Glover plays Albert, a character raised simply to be harmful, callous and overbearing to his wife in the most domineering of fashions possible. He would sort of a generic in that antagonistic sense; but as a character he plays it very well (he was out of Lethal Weapon, which made it feel weird to see him in this movie). He's a farmer and he adjures his servant wife (Goldberg's character, Celie) to do things for him, shave him also. However, through these experiences she learns the panache and forthrightness to speak up for herself.My only problems with it would be that I thought the way it established Goldberg as a comedic figure was sort of out of character; when she loses the urge to smile, we lose the urge to smile, as if it's infectious. When she didn't go with her sister, I sort of wondered why not... I guess her mind was running through a totally haphazardly sense of reasoning, but still it does hit you emotionally. The real thing this movie does rely on sometimes emotion and also the conquer through this oppression; oppression is really problematic and throughout you really are in a state of oppression, wanting to be liberated just like Goldberg (In the sense you identify with her).I was recommended to see this movie, so I finally bought it and I must say I definitely recommend it as well; the relationships are not complex, but they're deep and profound. The evolution of Celie's character get you really grounded in involvement throughout. Also Oprey Winfrey as Sophie is a great character to use as the analogy for Celie; however, she's not a really necessary character, but she is a character that can get through to Celie. ... I can say that I will one day watch this movie over again. It does leave you with a mellow feeling, and a real sense of freedom in such tumultuous times. It however will not leave you with the same emotions as his subsequent ""Schindler's List"" film does, and in fact, Spielberg's trademark barely feels pervasive in the movie... still he utilizes fluid and swimmingly posed shots that are set to really make you look galore at a wonderful experience; it is not a true story, so there will be no qualms for anybody with any proclamation that this is so.",The Color Purple
96,parkerrodney,A Classic to live forever,10,26 December 2018,"The Color PurpleThe Color Purple is a moving tale of the life of a black woman living in the south in the early part of the 20th century, struggling to weather racism, misogyny and poverty. The Color Purple is not just moving and compelling story which grips the viewer's attention and keeps it to the end, but it does so while carefully walking the tightrope of appealing to as broad an audience as possible, without overstating the race issue in America. If there is one critical element about The Color Purple is that it understates life circumstances for blacks in America at that time. By no means is this a deal breaker, the film is nothing short of an amazing pierce of cinematic art. The story line, script, cinematography, acting and sound track are all exceptional. No expense was spared on this film as it has emerged as a classic of its time.Film making of this type forms a genre of its own, and entry into this class of movie making is a difficult task. Few writers and producers have the skill set to pull it off, and few movie house productions are willing to take on the politics of truth telling. In this class we are talking about films which take on the issue of oppression. Such films include A Soldier's Story, Schindler's List, American History X, and so on. Older films include To Kill a Mocking Bird and In the Heat of the Night.There is nothing shallow about this film, as some of it provides a glimpse into African American culture (comedy, drama, religion, socializing) which only African Americans are privy to. My rating for this movie is a solid ten. The Color Purple was number 4 in terms of box office receipts in 1985. The movies which had greater ticket sales were Rock IV, Rambo: First Blood and, Back to the Future. What people want to see and will pay for, says a great deal about our culture of pursing fiction and fantasy over fact-based story telling. My opinion is simple, people don't want to be reminded of historical and present day ugliness of the human race.If you're seeking a movie to watch and have not seen the Color Purple, you will be deeply moved by both the story and the acting.",The Color Purple

There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role.This movie made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory each Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion.

100,Riddler2,It's about Life it's about Love it's about Us! The Master of Film's underrated masterpiece!,10,29 June 2015,"The Color Purple where do I begin with this important and wonderfully poignant masterpiece of American Cinema where do I begin? This film is so beautiful and heartfelt and just so wonderfully enriching and thoughtful it really is so enriching you really connect with the film I was really connected to the film I have a strong meaningful connection to the film and that is the strong emotional and heartbreaking story that Unfolds and it never lets you relax right until the end which I won't spoil here I want everyone to experience the film for themselves I just was lost for words and I am now writing this review because I want the film to connect with all who see it I really do feel a strong connection to Celie and Nettie the sisters at the heart of the story and all the other characters Shug Mister Harpo Squeak Old Mister Sophia everyone in this film has a story and a connection to the main story and I feel really strongly that this film is for all time and will live on for new generations to experience and connect with these extraordinary women of such courage and such strength and sheer determination to not tolerate the abuse and the suffering they are forced into it really touched me at the end when everything is resolved because they learn an vital lesson in life stand up for yourself and never tolerate suffering and abuse and the film is very timely for me because the news always reports on sexual violence by dominant men and women which should not be tolerated and it really should not be happening and sadly people still feel the need to treat people with no compassion or dignity or kindness and that is what I took away from this unforgettable film never force yourself to dominant forces of malevolent evil I really feel strongly towards this film that it teaches the world that sexual violence or discrimination towards any race of gender inequality is an act of pure evil and an injustice to all man kind and all race religion and all people! Back to the Film the direction is unforgettable and so pristine it reminded me of the old films of the 30s and 40s it really touched me the film has a strong directional style it effortlessly moves from one time period to the other with ease The film is presented over a 35 40 year period or time frame if you will and the first few scenes are so beautiful because they capture all emotions in a split second Happiness, Joy and wonder when Celie and Nettie are playing together and doing their signature hand clapping motion which is their way of connecting with each other they know they are together because they have connected with their hand clapping motion and song that they sing every time they are on screen together they love each other and are very close you can feel that! Celie at the tender age of 14 is pregnant 14 forced to have a baby by her own father yes her own father and one of the most brutal sequences of any motion picture is when her newborn is taken away from her by her own father I knew I was in for an unforgettable movie experience after those opening scenes because I cried my eyes out I lost all happiness and joy and cried and I cried all the way through in the right places of course and when the end comes you have earned it it just does not happen straight away this a long film but boy is it it worth your 2 hours and a half but you have to watch it alone no one else you need to gather yourself at the end of the film and sit through the credits just so you can process what you have just experienced and to think this landmark Masterpiece was nominated for 11 Oscars and won none is a travesty a real tragedy it is awful that this film was not Best Picture and was beaten by Out of Africa out of blooming Africa it is a real travesty the biggest mistake the Oscars ever made The Color Purple is the Best Picture of 1985 and here's why, the direction the performances the emotional connection you have to the characters and the uplifting ending! One Last note I want to thank Steven Spielberg for giving us this film so we all can share this film with the world and connect with it as much as I did and always will for all time! And no John Williams score can you all imagine what he would have composed for this masterpiece instead we get Quincy Jones why I have no flipping idea! I will always love this film and after the credits finished I cried for hours so I urge all people to see this heartbreaking and thoughtful film as it should be loved and it will always be loved for all coming time!",The Color Purple

My buddy came up to me with the color purple, which he had not seen. I said no, he said yes, i said no... well you get the idea. The reason i didn't want to rent it was because i knew if i watched it i would turn into a blubbering mess. To cut a long story short (too late*) We rented the color purple and like i knew i would, i was crying like a 5 year old with a skinned knee...How ever not that my ""oh so butch"" mate could make fun cause he was cry more than I was.That story was to show how this movie is so wonderful it can make 2 big strong boys cry. Whoopi is stunning as the sympathetic Celie. And the way i judge the way a person playes a bad guy, is if i want to reach into the screen and punch them in the face, and man did i want to sock Mr.,MINOR SPOILER We were crying out of happiness for Celie, not out of sadness.

The movie starts with Celie played by first Desreta Jackson then Whoopi Goldberg, Sofia played by Oprah Winfrey and Shug Avery played by Margaret Avery. These talented, iconic actresses tell their character's story so well that each role is as important as the others and plays off one another. At the end of the film, they come together and share in Celie's reunited happiness among a field of purple flowers. Between the quotable memorable scenes, the amazing orchestrated music and actors also including Danny Glover; the Steven Spielberg film eternally goes on the Holy Grail list of must-watch films not only for black people but everyone to enjoy.",The Color Purple
105,bysterbusch,I'm Glad I Waited 35 Years to Watch This,2,17 January 2021,Confusing movie. Was it serious or funny? There were parts that made me chuckle but the serious parts had 1960's Disney music dubbed over them and I didn't know how to react. A really good ensemble of actors but the direction could have been better. The whole tie-in with Africa was a good fit but executed poorly. It was also not believable that Celie was excited to move back into a house that had been so traumatic to her life. An hour could have easily been trimmed from the movie with no ill effect,The Color Purple

I had never seen a movie so captivating and involving, that basically grabbed me and shred me to pieces and then had me rejoicing and running what felt like shocks of electricity thru me (my eyes are watering just remembering the moment). Steven Spielberg has faired better critically and comercially with his classics  ""Jaws"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", but this is the masterpiece that put him at ground zero when dealing with true dramatic prose and the courage and triumph of the human spirit. A true classic in all means of the word.",The Color Purple

It's one of the best films I've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. For the people that don't really like it or understand it, you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span.Even if I haven't seen all his films yet, I'd have to say that this is Spielberg at his peak. It's pretty sad to see that movies as great as ""The Color Purple"" don't come along too often 'cause I think all of us are in desperate need of first-class motion picture entertainment in these hard times.Movies like this are more than just movies; they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more.The idea that it was nominated for 11 Oscars (even Best Picture of the Year) and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes. Spielberg wasn't even nominated for Best Director!

110,tyvo79,Excellent!,10,24 September 2021,"It's rare for a film adaptation to really capture the core materials essence. In 1985, Steven Spielberg accomplished that with this absolute masterpiece. In my opinion this is his best film and I'm a big fan of his work. 11 Oscar nominations and 0 awards. It's a travesty. Out of Africa is a good movie but I've never had the urge to ever see it since I first watched it. On the other hand, The Color Purple is a film that demands attention! The entire cast give their heart and soul to their performances and it shows. Full of all the emotions you didn't know you had and amazing quotable moments, it's one of the most human stories ever committed to film and one of the most soul-feeding. The cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen to date. I'm really tired of reviews from people that don't have a spirit or even know about the novel. It's a work of fiction. Some elements aren't going to be super-realistic based on that factor alone. Get a grip. It's a beautiful film with a beautiful message of hope over adverse circumstances. It's not that strange.

113,lee3993,The Academy Awards' Biggest Snub!!!,10,7 February 2007,"No motion picture featuring an all-black cast has ever won an Oscar for best picture. ""The Color Purple"" should have been the first. The fact that this all-time classic was nominated for 11 Oscars without a single win is an atrocity. I doubt if any other movie has ever been so artificially praised yet so deliberately slighted. This movie had everything, a first rate director in Steven Spielberg, arguably the best director of his time, if not all-time. It featured an all-star ensemble with the likes of Danny Glover, Whoopie Goldberg, Adolph Caesar, Oprah Winfrey, Margeret Avery, and Laurence Fishbourne, to name a few. Never mind that the script was adapted from the best selling novel by the distinguished Pulitzer prize winning author, Alice Walker. Every detail of it was orchestrated with precision. The legendary Quincy Jones' music, the cinematography, the makeup, the costume design, and other behind the scenes aspects were all stupendous. The story of how two sisters(Oscar worthy performances by both Goldberg and newcomer Akosia Buria), unwillingly separated as adolescents, finally reunite after years of trials and tribulations is the stuff legends are made of. The only way to describe this historical event is that it is spiritually uplifting, expertly crafted, a genuine and majestic tearjerker in the vein of earlier classics such as ""Imitation of Life"" and ""Gone With the Wind"". The Academy should have been ashamed to allow such a rewarding and masterful achievement to go uncrowned.",The Color Purple

115,louisemarieperry,"Classic Film, Overly Sentimental",8,21 August 2021,"This film will always be a classic. However it suffers at the hands of 'the Spielberg effect'.Character development - there are inconsistencies in the character arc of Glover's Albert; one moment the menacing bully and the next comically bumbling and hapless. Some of the more slapstick comedy moments shoehorned in are out of place with the somber subject matter and is jarring. Celie's own character development is also inconsistent, afraid to speak around Albert most of the time but suddenly happy to sit smugly watching him fumbling in the kitchen and hurting himself (in real life he would almost certainly have taken out his frustration on her and she would at least try and stay out of his way).The soundtrack is sweeping and beautiful, but overly sentimental, almost cheesy. The jazz works well.This film takes a gritty subject matter and makes it all glossy and pretty.That being said it is highly enjoyable and well acted. I've not read the book so can't comment on that but it feels like fiction to me.",The Color Purple

The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old cliché by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple.It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend.Also the acting performances are superb - especially Oprah who I now have a new found respect for.Well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.",The Color Purple

Leads all fantastic, particularly Whooping Goldberg. She was gentle, pathetic, strong and fierce and times throughout and all felt honest and believable. I was truly taken in her journey and came out almost exhausted from the roller coaster of emotions that she, and me, went through.
Danny Glover does the impossible by being genuinely unlikeable through the majority of the movie. Oprah was another standout and well deserved of her Oscar nom.
Overall, an outstanding movie that crushed my heart and had me sobbing but beautiful at the same time. Long yet fast paced. I'll watch again in a decade and have no doubt that I will be crying again.",The Color Purple

This film was really a breakthrough for so much of this cast. It really got jipped at the Oscars in 1985 in my honest opinion.Whoopi Goldberg's first major role in a fair world would have won her the Oscar. Also, that same year, both Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey were both nominated for best supporting actress. Granted one of them should have claimed that award but since both were nominated it almost ruined the chance for either of them.Margaret Avery as Shug Avery was the gem in this movie in my honest opinion. Her character is versatile and I really wish she had come on stronger as an actress after her success in this film. Whoopi Goldberg as the main character Celie was Whoopi's most powerful performance ever. This film also helped rocket Danny Glover's career. As the abusive Albert, I could never see another person fitting the role better.What can one say about the character of Ms. Sofia??? Oprah Winfrey is a woman of sheer flexibility and anyone who ever saw her performance in this film knows why. Her character was definitely the most flamboyant of the film and the most ""showy"" as far as skills are concerned.I really wish the characters were more developed like in the book but with only a few hour movie it was almost impossible. Maybe Spielberg could have captured the entirety of the novel better with two movies allowing time for characters like Squeak (played by Rae Dawn Chong) to be developed fully. Otherwise, this is one of my favorites of all time and has always been.",The Color Purple

It deals with issues most people have a hard time facing. That is precisely why Spielberg is one of my favorites, because of the level of integrity in his work.  The situations that he brought to the service in this film, ugly as some of them were, are reminiscent of that time period.  We don't like to see our ancestors in such a hideous depiction because it's like holding up a mirror to humanity and saying, ""Take a good look at who you really are"".  I like films that disturb our senses and strip away arrogance and false pride.  I like films that say ""It wasn't always great to be an American, but whatever we went through, we're still here. We're not dead yet.""  Whether Spielberg gives that voice to difference sexes, races or species, I think it is a message that needs to be heard again and again, because that it where our sense of pride can come from. Not from a false idea of who we were.Beyond the moral issues of this film, the cinematography was wonderful.  The luscious landscapes of purple flowers and verdant feels was enough to take my breath away.  The performances were just as wonderful.  Whoopi Goldberg's film debut proved her ability as a future top-notch actress.

It is as moving and as breathtaking as it was the very first time I saw it.  I cannot to this day believe that it was shut out at the Oscars. I just looked at the list of nominated films for that year, and none of them hold up as well as this one.  There are none on that list that I would want to watch again - except, for The Color Purple.  The movie is perfect - from the opening strains of Quincy Jones' exquisite score, to the end credits, it is perfect. Even if any of the people involved in the film had never made another one, their places in cinematic history would be forever cemented at the very top. Although the film does not present every aspect of Alice Walker's incredible novel (most notably, Spielberg downplays the sexual relationship between Celie and Shug), it captures the heart and the soul of Celie's journey to becoming her own person.  It is riveting.  You don't want the film to end - what happens next?  You come away from this film refilled, replenished. There are no 'filler' characters, and each actor's performance is monumental.  You will come away from this film a changed person, and if you don't, God help you.",The Color Purple

The moments of levity were over-the-top and many of the emotional moments went straight for the throat.Also, I felt it should have ended when she left him. It would have felt more natural.

She IS a legend!"". This movie shows us how humanity can be cruel and merciless, but it show us too how kind we can be. Celie is a black, unlucky, sad, and ugly girl, who has a cruel and despicable father, who sexually arrests her twice (and take her children away). The only person on the world who loves Celie (and vice-versa) is her sister Nettie. But the cruel fate made Celie marries with Mister/Albert (Danny Glover) and her life turns into a sorrowful hell. She is separated from her sister (the most sad scene of the movie), and her happiness seems to end on that moment. I will not tell more about the story, because I don't want to spoil this perfect movie. I saw this film three times, and I cried a river THREE TIMES! Whoopi is Awesome! How can a human being act like her?? To me, she is one of the three legends alive (Meryl Streep and Susan Sarandon are the other two). She STOLE the scene!!!

The only reason why this film has the name of a classic is that people feel obliged to find it a classic. I cannot tell why this movie is so bad. Is it Steven Spielberg in his early days, or do the actors perform so poorly. This film just strains after effect. And that's it. Steven imagined a cinema full of crying people. That should have been what he wanted. This is only a good film for uncritical watchers. Movie addicts simply cannot like it.My first point of criticism contains the acting. This film is totally destitute of any form of nuance. When miss Millia starts the car, every civilian runs away. This film is not meant to be funny, don't try to mix it with humor either. When Albert brings Shug to her car heading for Chicago, Celie carries all the bags and suitcases. This is stereotyped. I cannot believe that the book by Alice Walker is as exaggerated as the film.I don't think you can make a film on Alice Walker's novel that is both funny and serious. Alice Walker meant this to be a serious, emotional story. The film should be serious too. The character of miss Sofia, funnily performed by Oprah Winfrey, is exaggerated. So much exaggerated that she is funny. Oprah should have performed less like a comedian. She is a strong woman, but she should not be a woman who makes the audience screaming with laughter.Another unclear scene is when Shug Avery and people in the church start to sing for God. This is totally in veracious. Why such an enthusiasm of all people at the same time? Why such a oneness? It is not made clear by Steven.I guess the only reason why this film has begotten any popularity is that it might strike people who are not into films that much. It cannot strike critical watchers unless those watchers are not critical enough.",The Color Purple

Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover are excellent, even Oprah Winfrey does a reasonable job. I suppose that one of the reasons that this movie is so highly considered is that it was truly groundbreaking for much of white America.

It stirs every emotion of the heart, mind, and soul. One cannot help but feel Celie's emotional pain and be drawn into her personal hardships and heartache.

Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey(oh lord!), Danny Glover, and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong together with her, throughout the movie, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she's at her most arrogant, and shows us that ""sinners"", indeed, ""have souls too"". The always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of(I'd say sir)Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film!

The Color Purple is one of these profound movies: deep, and spiritual.  The Color Purple is why movies are made:  to tell an amazing story. This movie was made a year before I was born, so I only now have the pleasure of seeing this movie.  I first saw it a couple years ago and since have been profoundly impacted by this movie.  Not only are there great lessons throughout the movie, about women overcoming unjust circumstances, but it is a great lesson in Karma.  That ending is just about the most powerful I have seen, with the exception of some scenes in the Lord of The Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring.  I have a sister and I don't know how I would go on knowing I wouldn't see her for so long, or whether I would ever see her at all. The Color Purple shows the power of family, the power of friends, the power of laughter, the power of being freed from a restricted life.  It is, in short, about the powers in life.  Though it is a long movie (it seemed about three or so hours), it is time well-spent, and you won't regret it.My advice for going into this movie is, well, be ready to cry.  Keep an open mind, though, and let yourself feel the full force of the movie.  I have never cried more for any movie, so guys, if you plan on watching it with your girlfriend, don't expect to be able to sit through it without some waterworks.  It's okay, though.

147,voidmind,"Can you say, ""syrup""?",4,27 March 2003,"You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote. (Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such... that I don't know about. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome. While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me: ""Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life."" This is over-the-top sentimentality. When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss Millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife Sophia's real name, ""Oprah,"" backwards. Spielberg isn't above such ""cuteness.""It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion. Schindler's List was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire Saving Private Ryan too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.",The Color Purple
148,bobstopper,Tedious and Irritating,4,3 December 2006,"I don't mind a film which uses tragedy to pull at heart strings, but it has to be intelligent and tasteful. The Color Purple is no such film. Spielberg lays the tragedy on with a thickness which makes it seem ludicrous. It seems the vast majority of the film does little more than try to insist upon its viewers that this woman's life is sad and unfair using methods which are so exaggerated and transparent that it distracts the viewer from getting lost in the story and simply keeps reminding them that they're watching a film which is trying far too hard to make them feel something.Some examples of this over-reaching can be seen in Whoopi Golberg's portrayal of Celia; the ridiculous state Celia first finds her new home in; the way Celia and Shug read in turn; and the irritating mood music played on cue each time Spielberg tries to saturate us in whatever emotion he's trying to evoke in us. The concept of subtlety has been completely lost on Spielberg in this film.The film does have its saving graces however. Apart from Goldberg's overdone portrayal of Celia, the acting is good, particularly from Oprah. The story itself (which I have not read) would quite probably be very emotional and interesting if it hadn't been told with such awkwardness. Margaret Avery's singing was divine, truly the only thing in the film that made me authentically feel something other than the urge to stop watching. For these things I give the film a 4. Had Spielberg not corrupted it so badly it quite possibly might even be worth the 7.6 stars it currently sits at on IMDb.",The Color Purple

Whoopi did a wonderful job as ""Celie"", as did the young lady who played the younger version of the character (the one who took the brunt of the abuse). Glover was perfectly cast as ""Mister"". With one or two exceptions, Oprah hasn't been as fine of an actress since she was ""Sophia"" (though, when you're the richest woman in the Milky Way, who needs to be consistent?! You GO girl!) Margaret Avery was the spirit and breath of ""Shug"" and Tina Turner was right to turn it down; she would've been awful, I think.

The worst thing about watching it is the parade of bloopers, pretty much a slip of logic and likelihood every five minutes or so.So she meets her son for the first time in 20 years. He emotionally says with tears in his eyes ""mabubwa zumbe"" or something like that. So he's had a month in a boat crossing from Africa just preparing for this moment and he couldn't learn how to say ""Hi Mom!""? You can just see a heavy hand behind such scenes- ""Ah, having him say something in Swahili will be DRAMATIC!"" So logic be damned...Her husband hides 20 years of letters from her sister in Africa? Sure he doesn't destroy them, he just keeps them hidden. And sure her sister isn't smart enough to send some of them to other people in the town with a note to take them to her sister- NO, she just keeps sending them to the same place for 20 years even though no one answered! Never crossed her mind to send them, say, care of the local church, postman, relative, friend, bank, or Western Union Office. No, it just wouldn't be dramatic enough if the sister were minimally intelligent rather than just mindlessly persistent. Ah, LOVE says the director...And of course she could not just be one of the poor and disadvantaged Blacks, she must have some shock noble past- a ""real father"" who happened to be rich. Hadn't we done with that particular devise in 18th Century fiction? Does it lend anything to the story to make it so?

There are some people that feel Steven Spielberg's adaptation did not do Alice Walker's novel any justice - but books and movies are never going to be able to convey the same things. This movie should be watched with anyone interested in equality, freedom, and human rights - but more importantly, it should be watched by those who have not yet learned these values.The Color Purple is, undoubtedly, the most powerful and, dare I say, best movie I have ever seen. My first viewing was when I was about eight years old - the story has haunted me ever since - I remember hiding my face in front of my parents, as I didn't want them to see me upset! The characters became part of my play-time - my brother and I would pretend to act out certain scenes - we'd usually play Sofia (Winfrey) - I guess her spirit was inspiring to us. Over the last 18 years, I have watched it numerous times - each time noticing something new. I recently read Alice Walker's novel, which made me see the movie differently once more. The Color Purple is also the only movie that has ever made me cry - I cried on my sixth viewing! I will always remember Sofia charging into Mister's house and setting her ground-rules, and I will always remember Christmas time when she is reunited with her family, only to be allowed to stay for a few minutes. I will never forget the moments when Celie and Nettie are separated, and when they finally meet again after so many years apart.

163,nene91392,The Pain for Love,9,15 July 2014,"The Pain for Love This movie is all about the main character Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) who was raped and abused by her father (Leonard Jackson). Around the age fifteen, her father forces her to marry a man just as abusive as he is to her. Celie is rather content about moving in with her new husband, Mister (Danny Glover), because she can remove her sister, Nettie (Akosua Busia), from her father's house. However, after Nettie lives in Mister's household for a short time with refusing his sexual needs, Mister kicks Nettie out. Celie's life becomes uneasy, as the only person that ever loved her is snatched from her. Nevertheless, her life makes a complete turnaround when Mister makes Celie take care of his ill mistress, Shug (Margret Avery), until she is well again.Celie suffers frequent abuse from the male figures in her life and she reacts by shutting down emotionally and being obedient to their needs. Many women in this movie are suffering from many types of abuse. The African-American male figures in The Color Purple, throw their masculinity around very often. They rape, and abuse black women, their wives, to make the women feel inferior. However, some try to overcome the abuse that is given to them; they try to show they are strong, black women that will stand for no man to put their hands on them. So Celie tries to find the strength and the willpower to overcome the abuse and find herself again. The movie The Color Purple, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a very appealing film to watch. It shows how so much pain is put into one person, Celie, over so many years that basically, that's all she knows and feels as though its normal. Then someone, Shug, comes in her life and teaches her love and the concept of the color purple, how you're suppose to enjoy life and not always be in pain. One viewer states that Celie ""has such a horrible life, she's not stopping to smell the roses, and she's just surviving."" Eventually, Celie does learn to live, and to love life.",The Color Purple
164,silver_wing9000-1,Amazing....just beyond words,10,27 March 2006,"Love him or hate him, Steven Spielberg knows how to make a movie. This one in particular has to be his most amazing work (though the academy didn't think so...wrong there). I have to admit when I had heard Oprah had done this film and won a nomination for her role of Sofia, I honestly thought it was because she's Oprah and this big star, and like an idiot I thought that fact helped get her the nomination, little did I know that she was one of my more favorite characters in any movie I've seen, she was amazing. Her performance has to be one of the best performances by an actress I have ever, EVER SEEN; how she captured the vivacious and full of life Sofia, who's life behind bars and as a maid, broke her spirit and will to move on dazzled me. I've never been more impressed by any actress than I was about her. I began to forget she is the multi-billion dollar woman who is on our televisions everyday and believed she was this amazing woman Sofia. All I have to say is Fantastic JOB ""O"". Whoppi Goldberg blew me away, I love her comedy and her role in Ghost is one of my favorites, but her heart-breaking performance as shy, timid Celile has to be another one of the best performances I have ever seen. I just felt for this character so much, and just wanted to save her from her disgusting situation. Her timid smile and sweet personality captivated me and I fell in love with this character. She was and still is an amazing actress, but this film was one of her best. The rest of the cast of Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, and the rest of this amazing cast kept you in the story, thinking that this was a documentary with how realistic their acing was. It was the first movie I have to say gives you an almost true to life feeling of raw human emotion with its gorgeous cinematography, true to life characters and deep symbolic messages of hope and love. It was a shame and I think it completely wrong that this film was not given any Oscars or even a nomination in the Baftas because in my book this film is a masterpiece and should go down as one of the best films ever made. Mind you they say Citizen Cane is the best movie in the world and it did not win Best Picture, so I guess not all great films have to win an award to be a classic, but it still is a disappointing shame.

This is a character that makes you realize that no matter how low your life has gotten, there is always hope for a better tomorrow.",The Color Purple

169,jasoncoleman-99756,Great Film,10,24 March 2019,"I have watched The Color Purple several times, especially when I was younger as it is one my sisters favorite movies. When I was younger, I would always would watch the movie without any sense of the plot, theme or who was in the movie. When I had to watch the movie in high school for an English project, I started to grasp the concept of the movie and gained a perspective of the story that was being told. I was aware that The Color Purple was adaptation of a book unto the silver screen, but after viewing the film this week, I would be interested in reading the book this summer. Steven Spielberg did a masterful job bring to life the story told by Alice Walker in her 1982 book.The lighting was natural on the set and very organic with the flowers blowing in the wind and in the bar scenes were well light to showcase Shug's musical performances. The full screen angles shot in the field helped me gain an understanding of life in Georgia for African- Americans and I thought acting was superb giving the experience of the cast. Spielberg tremendous job of pacing the story, so that you did feel like there were details left out that did not try into the plot. The re-watch value of The Color Purple is really high and as I stated before I want to check out the book to get more depth of the characters.",The Color Purple

This movie made my emotions go from being happy to sad in just a moment. One character that stood out to me was Sofia (Oprah). I related to her spunk and stubbornness throughout the movie and it really made me fall in love with her. This movie has won over my heart and is on top of my favorite movie list. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to watch a good movie.",The Color Purple
171,manuelfuentes-31387,Standing Ovation,10,18 December 2019,"The movie, The Color Purple tells the story about Celie, a black girl who is sexually abused by her stepfather, gives birth twice. Both babies are taken away from her for profit. She then is given to a farmer to be his slave basically. All that happens before she is fifteen. Her former husband abuses her physically and emotionally. He forces her to raise his children, do house chores, take care of his needs-sexually and otherwise. At one point he even brings his girlfriend to live with them, and Celie is her caregiver. Celie loses all contact with her sister Nettie, after Nettie refuses Mister's sexual advances, and is banned from his property. The theme of this film -how women are treated-specifically black women can be seen mainly through Celie. We also have other characters that present the theme as well, these are Sofia, and Nettie. This story takes place in the 1920's, but the theme is one that repeats itself. We can see the same theme in the film What's Love Got to do with it, where Tina Turner suffers from domestic violence at the hand of her husband and partner., Ike Turner.",The Color Purple

It reminded me of where my own mother was from. I think the idea that Shug and Celie had an affair was portrayed very nicely. Being a straight person, i don't think i'd really want to see the explicit moves there,I think that Nettie as just so sweet and so cute, and it was wonderful that she ended up with her niece and nephew, taking care of them. It showed how back in the day, men did marry much younger women, and also the prejudice that the white people had for blacks to keep them in their place..

175,broadwaybaby39,"A compelling, tear-jerking masterpiece",8,27 July 2009,"When I heard that Whoopi Goldberg had been nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as Celie in this film, I was not at all surprised after seeing it. She was compelling, she tugged at your heartstrings, and you can't help but cheer for her when she finally stands up to Mr., her husband who had made her life so miserable up to this point. Another performance I very much enjoyed was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia. I was surprised, to say the least, that she could act this well. She was funny, strong, but she was also weak in some respects, like any other person.Now, as with all movies, there were a few things I would have changed. I wished it could have been more like the book, where Celie and Shug Avery are full-on lovers, complete with cheating and reconcile, whereas in the movie, all they have is one little kiss, and after that are only friends! The former, in my opinion, establishes Celie as different from others, and sort of makes her more sympathetic in that respect. Another thing I liked better in the book than the movie was that Mr., AKA Albert, apologizes to Celie for all he's done to her and becomes her friend, sympathizing and trying to help when it is found out that Shug has been unfaithful to her. In the film, this development of his character is present, just not very clear.Even though it has flaws, what movie, no matter how wonderful, doesn't? It's still beautiful, sad, the acting is still top-notch, and I guarantee you, if you don't at least FEEL like crying at the very end, you must have ice-cold water running through your veins.",The Color Purple

Whoopi Goldberg acting was incredible in this film, no one would have ever thought that this was her feature film, for she acted as if she was a veteran in the acting role. I think that Steven Spielberg was the perfect director for this movie.With his great directing ability he definitely should have won an Oscar for this film, yet the Color Purple received no awards although it was nominated for 11 of them. This film will literally bring tears to your eyes, as you witness the pain and suffering that our ancestors had to go through.

177,daramolao,"Brilliant performance, excellent cast!",10,22 August 2004,"I read The Color Purple in less than a three days. Without classes or work, I could have finished it in a day...yes, it was that good. I was very hesitant about watching the movie because I have been disappointed by many novel/comic -to-movie transitions but I got the DVD. Great performances. The casting was superbly done. The music tells the story itself, the cinematography is excellent and it just makes me sick that this movie did not win a single Oscar. Every actor gave his/her best and I must admit the movie excluded several details in the book but it was already long...making it longer would turn it into ""Roots"".Okay, so, this highly emotional and moving story centers around Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). Alice Walker presented The Color Purple as a combination of Celie's letters (diary format) and some narration from Celie, an abused African-American girl who is married to a man she does not have feelings for. she goes through life being treated as the scum of the earth by ignorant folks and even her own ""persumed family. abused as a child and as an adult, separated from her sister, battling spiritual demons, Alice Walker slowly, but triumphantly, takes us through the dark hallways of Celie's life and delivers a resounding climax as Celie makes peace with herself, her enemies, her family and reunites with her sister and children. If the book was a page turner, the movie is comparable. Great work. Great direction, production, acting, casting, great everything (editing could've been better). I love it! How can you not love it? People may think it's depressing...read Toni Morrison's books and you know what ""depressing"" means. This is near perfection and worth your two hours. See it...please",The Color Purple

179,roxannasumerall,Beautifully written classic,10,29 July 2012,"The Color Purple is a beautifully interwoven story about the trials one woman faced growing up in the early 1900's, during a time where women and especially women of color were frowned upon. Celie, who is the character played by Whoopi Goldberg, was given the hard road from the time she was old enough to know better. At the age of fourteen she had encountered things most women would never have to face. Yet throughout all the challenges she grew strong and learned to love herself. She eventually got others to love and respect her too. I feel this is the ultimate theme of this movie.This movies theme is subjective in nature and centers around the life of Celie as she embarks on a journey to find her place in the world she has been a victim of. The focus of the movie is centered on Celie's character and the challenges she has to overcome. This movie shows the complex nature between the various relationships of the characters involved. It allowed us to get a close up view of the growth of friendship between Celie and Shug Avery, who was played by Margaret Avery. There also was a bond that grew between Sophia, who was played by Oprah Winfrey and the other women.The theme of this movie is universal in the light of the occurrences. The challenges faced by Celie are not uncommon in society, and unfortunately these challenges are the reality of many young women today. Celie was molested by her father and bore two children that she didn't get to keep. She was given in marriage to a low life man named Mister (Albert). Mister abused Celie in every way possible. These are just a few of the traumatizing effects of growing up in Celie's world, which are directly related to the theme. The use of symbols in the movie helped to build appreciation for their value. The color purple was one symbol. It was important because it bared the title of the movie and it had implications of beauty, change and awareness of self. The use of the sun in this movie is also a symbol of happiness. The director Steven Spielberg also used a similar thematic element in Citizen Kane. He did this by focusing the theme on the main character in each of the films. There was also the use of motifs within the film. A big one was the letters from her sister Nettie which Celie didn't receive until the climax of the film. The receipt of the letters is what allowed Celie to recognize she was worthy of love and that someone loved her. The theme of The Color Purple resonates from its beginning to its end. It showcases a range of emotions and the plot is fully seen through the various cinematic effects. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and root for Celie's success. Although the movie was written over two decades ago, its theme still fits the society we live in now. The Color Purple is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed for years to come. I love this film, and encourage everyone to view it at least once in a lifetime. It is well worth watching!",The Color Purple

If you don't shed a tear during the last scene, then you must have a problem going on in your eyelids or just can't show any human emotions. I was surprised to learn that this was directed by Steven Spielberg, mainly because I just know him from doing special effect thrillers. I also don't understand how this movie could have been nominated for 11 Oscars and not win one. Whoopi Goldberg was SO robbed in her nomination, she should have won. In this movie, she gives the performance of her career. Surprisingly, Oprah Winfrey is pretty amazing too, I didn't now that she could actually act.

181,iluvhoobastank,not as good as the novel,4,16 February 2005,This film was a complete injustice to Alice Walker's novel and anyone who reads the novel should see how diluted for Hollywood the film is. The performances were excellent but Steven Spielberg's direction left a lot to be desired. As a student studying the novel I was disappointed with this adaptation and surprised at the director's failings as I am usually a fan! Many of my fellow students shared my opinions and could not understand how anyone who had not read the novel was to fully understand the narrative. If you want to watch a really gritty and powerful film I suggest you watch Mystic River. Read Alice Walker's novel and you'll know what I'm talking about.,The Color Purple

The color purple shows how having a hard life can make you so strong and keeping your head up high can really make your dreams come true. It describes the power of karma.

The acting in The Color Purple is what I believe makes this film stand out from other films of similar topics. Celie has meekness drilled into her, and Whoopi Goldberg portrays this concisely by constantly sheltering herself, her feelings, and most importantly her smile. Sofia, the character Oprah Winfrey plays, also is one of my personal favorite characters with her witty remarks, spiritedness, and capturing life throughout the movie. Both of these actors were able to effortlessly convey complex emotion ranging from oppression to freedom, and to despair to optimism. The lives that these women lead in the early 1900's are truly eye opening. They face prejudice and lack of control in their own lives that very few deal with today. The cast of The Color Purple is a very diverse one indeed, and has a wonderful array of talented actors to offer. I also believe that the choice to cast Oprah Winfrey as Sofia was very wise, as today she has become one of the most influential black women in the world. The film score is another element to this movie that I feel was very powerful. Quincy Jones did a remarkable job of strengthening the most powerful moments in the film, as well as beautifully complimenting the course of events throughout the story. I believe that most films are practically useless without music to back the action and this film is a perfect portrayal of that principal. All in all, the story that is portrayed in this film is truly moving and quite honestly somewhat disturbing at times, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a heartfelt drama focused on overcoming adversity that wasn't though possible to overcome.",The Color Purple

It significantly reminds those who lived during that time what life was like when there was no JUSTICE FOR ALL. It gives facts, and it opens a can of worms to the reality of what black men like ""Mister."" had done and was past down from generation to generation. At least today we do have laws instituted to protect the woman from such horrible and terrible abuse. I am a jazz singer, and Ms. Celie's Blues sung by such a great actress who played that part wonderfully. The song itself does not get enough attention and recognition as it should. I only hear it online or from the movie when I decide to play it. I like to hear more of Ms. Celie's Blues and have it played on various radio stations. Maybe the song will keep our people reminded of how we were treated during that time, and to teach our men not to revisit this type of behavior towards the black women ever again!",The Color Purple

186,atsfthom,"The trials and tribulations throughout the horrific life of Celie Johnson, a black woman in 1920's America.",10,13 April 2015,"Coming in 1985, this was Steven Spielberg's first attempt at melodrama; he had directed Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial 3 and 4 years previously. This inaugural bid for Spielberg as a dramatic director feels a bit clumsy at times, and at times he struggles to portray harrowing oppression suffered by Celie Johnson, the film's protagonist. This may be the result of the film's PG-13 rating, as the harsh themes of domestic violence and incest are at times brushed over too lightly. Despite these issues, Steven Spielberg's dramatic debut is shot tremendously and full of brilliant performances. Danny Glover, while subdued by the film's hesitation to portray violence, is convincing as the abusive husband of Celie. Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic as Celie Johnson, and was undoubtedly robbed of an Oscar in 1986. Margaret Avery is also great as the inspiration to Celie and performs a few great songs, at least one of which also should have won an Oscar. But the real standout performance is from Oprah Winfrey as the empowering Sofia, giving by far the most moving performance in the film. The original music and musical collaboration in the film is superb, adding a lot of heart to the film. If you are a fan of Steven Spielberg, and want to see his origins in drama, this movie will not disappoint. It is a great film for black and female empowerment, but is not as brutal as films like Schindler's List, making it a great introductory drama to Spielberg's decorated career.",The Color Purple

Honestly, I gave the film a 6 out of 10 because if you read the book, you would probably consider the film to be a downgrade and a snoozer, although it is a beautiful story. If we were rating the book, I would give it a 10. A major difference between the film and the novel, are the parts where Nettie discusses her time in Africa. In the film, Nettie's experience in Africa is shown very briefly although in the actual novel, her experience is written in numerous letters between Celie and herself. I believe that is a crucial part of the Color Purple because the differences between Africa and America are very important to the different areas of woman-ism, sexism and racism that was occurring during that time period. On the other side, the story of Celie being abused by a man who she thought was her father and going through the same abuse from her husband Mr.____ , also known as Albert, and then meeting Shug who inspires her in more ways than one to stand up for herself, is an amazing storyline. I strongly suggest reading the book first, and then watching the movie, to compare and contrast the mistakes the director did by taking parts out.",The Color Purple

It was interesting to read a book base on a person real life struggles and accomplishments.

Throughout both the book and movie, Celie faced a lot of challenges, internally and externally. The story is told in first person in the form of a letter. Celie addresses the letters to god and then later to her sister Nettie who is a missionary in Africa.I prefer to watch the movie rather then to read the book because I get an eye view of what is happening and a since of emotion that you don't get as much from the book itself. Although the book gives you details that are not shown in the movies itself, it does not capture the character feelings fully. When watching the movies i am more focused on the character as a whole rather then when reading the book you are focused on multiple people at one time.

The way us the reader notices is by the way she stood up to people she couldn't before.

In the other hand, the movie focuses on transition and doesn't show parts of the scenes that it is very important in the novel.

Her letters were now "" Dear Nettie"", Albert, or better known as ""Mr.__ "" hid the letters that Nettie wrote to Ceelie over the years.

For example, Ceelie finds a new love within a woman. This woman slowly built Ceelie's self- esteem and made her a stronger woman, Shug Avery was her hero.

196,stefan171,great but book is trillion times better,8,13 January 2006,"this film was an excellent film i loved it but not trying to dog Spielberg's work but the book was a trillion times more intense and meaningful, if he would have followed the book a little closer it would've been an even better film. the film lacks the compassion and forgiveness the book does. also the film made quite a lot of the afro-American public mad at Alice walker for suggesting that the black men were like 'pa and mister' but if they had read the book they would see that, thats not at all what she was intending to do. but never the less the film is still loved and adored. i just urge everyone that is in love with the film to read the book if they haven't already done so because they will love it, yes the film was good but the book was filled with more joy yet sadness, anger, heartbreak, rejoice and spiritual confinement",The Color Purple
197,pa-mcglasson,The Color Purple (1985),10,24 September 2014,"What an incredible Steven Spielburg did with his first attempt at a ""serious"" movie. The Color Purple takes place in the south during the early 1900s to the late 1930s.The Color Purple film is about an underprivileged African-American woman named Celie Harris, played by Whoopi Goldberg. She endures abuse from her father at a young age and continues into her adulthood by her horrible husband she calls Mister, played by Danny Glover. Mister takes Celie home to his three kids and right away Mister starts physically and sexually abusing her. The filming and editing techniques were really good in this film. Spielburg used a lot of track-in shots. This type of shot is when the camera physically moves in on the subject, typically going from a medium close-up to a tighter close-up to draw attention to an important moment in a character's story. The movement is smooth, the background is blurred, and it makes the audience feel the emotions of what is happening. An example of a track-in shot is when Mister takes Celie home for the first time and forces her to have sexual intercourse with him. The track-in shot zooms in on her face to show her expression. The film's most touching and heartbreaking moment is when Celie and her sister Nettie are separated. Mister banned Nettie from his land because she would not sleep with him. Spielburg did a great job with scenes that made the audience feel the emotions that the character was feeling. The film's cinematographer, Allen Daviau, did a great job capturing the emotions between Celie and Nettie. His main focus was on each individual character. He paid attention to each character's talents and potential in the story line, self-actualization. The meaning of this film shows great strength in the belief of God. Even though Celie has physically and emotionally been through a nightmare, her strength in God keeps her moving forward. The film also shows how strong her love for her sister and her children are. The meaning of the title symbolizes when Shug Avery says that she believes that it angers God if a person walks by the color of purple in a field without stopping to notice and admire it. In this statement, Shug summarizes her religious philosophy; to her, God is not some distant deity living on high, but a genderless, race-less being that wants people to appreciate and enjoy life. It is also significant that she chose the color of purple, for it is the color of royalty; and yet a really deep purple seems almost to be black. My take exactly is that the field of purple represents freedom and Celie, Nettie, Adam, and Olivia being together at the end. When I saw the movie, I believe that the main focus was on Celie and how she tells her experiences. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is going through a hard time. Watching this movie will open and inspire anyone's mind to understand that things will get better.",The Color Purple
198,esamouqueiro-116-253021,Simply the best,10,10 March 2020,The best story i have hever seen in a movie. The best director. Faboulous interpretation from the actors.,The Color Purple
199,r4z0rbl4d3,Beautiful and moving masterpiece,10,17 July 2005,"I saw The Color Purple again recently on DVD and even though I've seen in several times before it still touches me like no other movie! Whoopie Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey in their big screen debuts, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery and the rest of the cast are simply brilliant! It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and as the trailer said back in '85, you will never forget this movie! How very true. The beautiful shots and amazing acting makes it magical.If there is anyone who has not seen this movie then they are missing out on one of Spielbergs best movies to date. Why this movie wasn't awarded one single Oscar despite it's 10 nominations is beyond me! Whoopie got a Golden Globe for her role and Spielberg won Best Director by the Directors Guild of America. And they all get 10 out of 10 by me.",The Color Purple
200,chasejybarra,#1,10,20 March 2016,"This is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. The editing and score are superb. The acting and directing - simply amazing. Cinematography is out of this world! I think that Whoopi Goldberg is a under rated dramatic actress. They could not picked a better actress to play the role. Cinematography was gorgeous. The editing was spot on. I am not good at reviews. I just know this is my all time favorite movie. I love how the cuts in between her shaving Mister and Suge Avery running all to the beat of the African music. Oprah's role as Ms. Sophia was amazing. She played the role excellently. I would have not cast Glover in the role as Mister, but rather Morgan Freeman. The script, score, acting, directing, editing - all superb",The Color Purple
201,wigginsams,A Timeless Classic,10,29 June 2016,"This movie is the epitome of the Southern pre-World War I to post World War II climate and attitudes. While following the plight of a young Black woman,forced to marry at a young age, it addresses issues such as gender biases, racial stigmas, religion and even those matters which some may still consider taboo in today's society. Poignant and dramatic this movie is well worth its weight in gold. I am so fond of this movie that I wrote a 15 page term paper on it and the various topics explored for a sociology course. I have not read the book,although I plan to someday but it's my understanding that the book is as good, if not better, than the film version. Samotta Wiggins",The Color Purple
202,gambrose-77510,"TERRIBLE script, unrealistic, overly dramatic!",1,1 September 2016,"Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever watched I can barely muster the motivation to write this review. However you must know the Script is erratic, unrealistic and overplayed by the actors. They are infuriatingly shallow characters... I wonder how they were nominated for any awards let alone win so many! I have to say I think this was a sympathy vote for the all black cast. A total shame on the industry. This movie was a waste of money and a shame for the wonderful Oprah and Whoopi.And let me repeat this once more for emphasis. The AWFUL movie Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever watched I can barely muster the motivation to write this review.

203,wilbun,An Excellent Piece of Work,10,14 November 2005,"The Color Purple is an awesome book, movie, but best of all - Musical Play. I was blessed to attend the play on Saturday, November 12, 2005 and it exceeded my expectations. Not only could the cast sing very well, their acting was flawless. I must commend Oprah for having producing the play, for having the Angel net work as recipients, and for everything that she does - a truly gift from God she is.I enjoyed the twist to the play with Mista (Albert) actually asking Ms. Celie to marry him! What was even better - she told him No.I can't say enough about the book, I have read the book several times and have written an Essay paper on the Color Purple.The movie was so very touching - The play, the book, the movie are all quite entertaining. I continue to find myself crying throughout different scenes of the Color Purple. Somehow, it has that effect on many people.Hats off for an excellent piece of work.",The Color Purple
204,babyday,The Color Purple Review,9,4 February 2018,"The Color Purple outlines the life, marriage, friendships and family of Celie Johnson played by Whoopi Goldberg an African American women at the turn of the nineteenth century in the southern United States. Celie is essentially given to her husband she refers to as ""Mister"" or Albert Johnson. Albert is in need of a women to care for his children as he is widowed. Celie has great difficulties in life and relationships with the exception of her sister Nettie played by Akosua Busia. Celie evolves greatly within the film and develops strong relationships with other women in her life as she longs for her sister. Celie is determined to survive this life and frequently prays to God for help and salvation.Celie feels alone in her life with little enjoyment. Celie befriends her husband's mistress Shug Avery played by Margaret Avery and relies on her immensely to get through life with a husband she despises. Celie's step-son Harpo played by Willard Pugh marries Sophia played by Oprah Winfrey- Celie is ill prepared to give marital advice to Sophia as Celie only knows violence in her relationship. Celie silently observes her family around her and as she narrates the film allows movie goers know her thoughts. The Color Purple is racially charged as Sophia is punished for defending herself to a white man. Another movie that a deals with the injustice of racism is 42 a movie about Jackie Robinson. Different scenarios yet two people that overcame racism in pursuit to find happiness. The determination of the female characters- Celie, Nettie, Sophia and Shug to create a bond and a family in a time that was difficult for women and African Americans. The director used angles to zoom into times when Celie was so angry at Mister has she contemplated revenge on him. Along with the sound of sharpening the razor to shave Mister. Celie uses voice over narration during the film as her feelings and thoughts are not allowed to known to anyone but herself. This is impactful to the theme as Celie struggles to be a person in this film as she feels worthless and is conditioned not to speak for herself. The film is thought provoking and can even spark anger at the great injustices that take place throughout the film. Ultimately admiration arises for Celie as she develops as a person and friend all the while her prayers are answered.",The Color Purple
205,meisemann-78511,Simply heartrending,10,24 February 2020,This movie is simply heartrending. A masterpiece of Steven Spielberg with a plain wonderful Whoopie Goldberg.,The Color Purple
206,biancachocco,Twenty-one years later - what does the academy say about this film,10,25 March 2006,"11 Oscar nominations and zero win!!! Am yet to understand why - its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc- were all amazing - i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the Oscars that year...... it should go into the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges.... Its an amazing book - but true to Alice Walker's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so I am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out. The cinematography was amazing - the African scenes live much to be desired - the African part in the book is supposed to be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of Africa outside of the Safaris - so yes there had to be a complimentary Zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none West Africa ---- and most of all why get the people to speak Swahili --- who in West Africa speaks Swahili?? I just had to get that out of the way.......But as a story - amazing, film-making - out of this world - CLASSIC yes!!I own it and I watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.",The Color Purple
