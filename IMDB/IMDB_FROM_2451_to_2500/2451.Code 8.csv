0,SnoopyStyle,premise looking for execution,6,23 December 2019,"People with superpowers are forced to register. They are restricted and live second class lives. Anyone caught using their powers without permission is treated harshly. Connor Reed (Robbie Amell) is an Electric, a person with electrical powers. He works as a day laborer under the radar. He is desperate to save his sick mother. He takes a job from Garrett (Stephen Amell) and it spirals downwards into the criminal world.It's a sci-fi done on a budget. It's missing that big budget action sequence. It's fitting that it has two CW TV stars because it looks like a small screen movie. When compared to the best budget sci-fi in District 9, this does not have the same cinematic style. The premise is intriguing but it does need to be fleshed out more. It is well on its way and maybe somebody like Netflix will pick up something from it. At the end of the day, it is a TV sci-fi struggling to be bigger than its budget.",Code 8
1,claudio_carvalho,Watchable,5,25 February 2020,"In a near future, the construction worker Conner Reed (Robbie Amell) has abilities that are forbidden by the government. When his work is stopped by the police, he accepts to work to the gangsters Garrett (Stephen Amell) and his boss Marcus Sutcliffe (Greg Bryk) to raise money to his mother that is terminal.""Code 8"" is a watchable film in a future environment but absolutely predictable. The plot uses the usual clichés of the crime genre. The sci-fi and the abilities are only to disguise. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Code 8: Renegades"" (""Code 8: Renegades"")",Code 8
2,nogodnomasters,She's a healer,7,23 December 2019,"In the future, some people develop powers. Some people can read minds, others can burn, some have telekinetics. Connor Reed has electrical like his deceased father. His mother is sick and they need money. Using powers is by permit only, something that is cost-prohibitive. Connor reluctantly uses his powers to help a crime organization that manufactures a drug called ""psyke"" which is taken from spinal fluid. It is in demand.It is interesting to watch a variation on the X-men, without everyone having super abilities. People with powers are treated as ""undocumented"" workers. They wait by the roadside to get picked up for work.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Code 8
3,Sleepin_Dragon,It's not bad to be honest.,6,18 April 2020,"Code 8 is a decent enough film, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was worth skipping by, superhero builders and drugs taken from people's body bits, but it really isn't bad.Some nice ideas and some good special effects, it's not a huge budget film, but somehow they make it work. Don't expect Marvel, and don't expect Breaking Bad, but do expect a few interesting moments. Every single cliche under the sun is here, there's not a huge amount of originality, but enjoy it for what it is.I wonder if those that have given this 1 and 10 star reviews have actually seen this, those I've read with such extreme scores do not relate to this movie.Decent acting, Robbie Amell will of course have his fans, 6/10.",Code 8
4,CinemaSerf,Straight to video...,5,12 April 2020,"Robbie Amell is undoubtedly a good-looking man, but that really does not forgive the fact that as an actor, he is really dead behind the eyes. The concept here is quite interesting - ordinary people have superpowers and are all still pretty much persecuted by the authorities. Amell is down on his luck and has a sick mother so, to pay for her extortionately expensive treatment, he seeks work casually - and soon falls in with the wrong company where he uses his powers (he can generate and focus electricity) to further their petty, but increasingly ambitious criminal activities. This gets him caught up between a drug-smuggling gang and with the pursuing police. Cousin Stephen discards his bow and arrow for this film, instead heading the druggie gang that will betray everyone/anyone as soon as look at them. The dialogue and pace of the film - there are some decent action scenes - keep it moving quite well, and the visual effects do their job - but the acting is just bland and the story an amalgam of B-grade X-men themes.",Code 8
5,Calicodreamin,Could have been better,5,14 April 2020,Really strong concept that never gets off the ground. The acting is fair and the characters interesting but there's no chemistry. It's all too mellow for the emotions trying to be conveyed. There are too many characters and plots that it makes the storyline come off as disjointed. Kind of disappointed.,Code 8
6,trashgang,surprising good scifi crime flick.,8,13 June 2020,"During the pandemic I was running out of flicks here at home and on Netflix. But if you dig deep in the vaults of Netflix and out of your recommendations of them and your comfort zone you can find some nice treats.This scifi action flick has a lot to offer. The story is original and all elements are in it to make it a suspense full flick with lot of action and nice effects.I will not go into the story or so because you have to be dragged into the story itself but if you dig crime with a twist, here with people with superpowers then surely watch it.And acting is way above mediocre. Nice surprise.

7,deloudelouvain,Entertaining enough for me.,6,7 January 2020,"Concidering the budget Code 8 isn't a bad movie. Yes it could have been better but overall it's a movie that brings entertainment and that's sufficient for me as I wasn't looking for the next Oscar winning movie. Oscars will never be won by any of the actors. Not that they are bad but it could be better, that's all. Robbie Amell plays the leading character, not always convincing but good enough though. The special effects aren't that bad either, again concidering the budget. Storywise Code 8 is enjoyable to watch and that's all what matters.",Code 8
8,siderite,The Mutant-X version of Bright,7,18 April 2020,"This is a cliche movie from beginning to end, but that's exactly what it attempts to be. It's a platform for TV superhero veterans Robbie and Steve Amell to do what they do. The plot is something you've seen a lot outside the sci-fi genre as well, but it's all well acted and acts like a promising pilot for a series, if anyone takes it. Predictable, but sound, it's the dark version of Mutant-X, where powered people are treated like parias and need to work in the shadows, even against their will. Decent average film.",Code 8
9,ThomasDrufke,Impressive For the Budget,7,10 April 2020,"With a low budget (almost entirely supplied by the fans), Code 8 does a nice job of feeling bigger than the money behind the camera. The Amell cousins have been wanting to do this movie for years, and even debuted the short film during the H&V Chicago Comic Con I attended back in 2016, and you can clearly see the passion, blood, sweat and tears behind the production. It's not overly original nor is it really trying to be. But if you're looking for a laid back action sci-fi, there are far worse choices than Code 8.7.0/10",Code 8
10,westsideschl,Investment Crowdfunded,2,11 February 2020,"Nearly 2000 people (largest I've ever seen) crowd funded this movie so you might see some self-interest positive reviews.
As for the film: Cheaply produced w/filler scenes from early 1900s b & w film clips showing people working. Boring, and not clear why pertinent other than they were probably free. Usual highly borrowed & repeated storyline of people w/super powers (gawwd!) being pursued by the government. Sci-fi angle consisted of the boringly standard cheap hooks of force hands (mostly electrical in this case); colored eyes to indicate some power; cheap drones you can buy from China now. Finally, the usual couple of gunfight scenes between goodies & baddies.
Acting by all was TV series/shorts level quality. Script ended up going nowhere - literally as it ended you kept asking yourself, ""What, if anything, did I watch?""",Code 8
11,The-Sarkologist,A Different Look at Superpowers,6,23 April 2020,"This is another one of those straight to Netflix movies, which as I have mentioned in the past, is sort of the modern version of the straight to DVD movies that many of us would end up hiring when we were board and had basically seen all of the other movies that we wanted to see at the video shop. That basically means that it really doesn't seem to meet the quality of the films that tend to make it to the cinema, and of course the budget does tend to be lower as well.However, this film actually wasn't too bad, and it certainly had some more charm than some of the other, rather bad, movies that I have watched on the platform. Anyway, the film is based on a short film of the same title that was made back in 2016. It is set in an alternate history where a group of humans have developed super powers, and tend to work on construction sites. In fact, they built a huge city called Lincoln City, where the film is set. However, over time machines were developed to replace them, and these powers, as they are called, have become an underclass in society. In fact, the laws are structured to make it as difficult as possible for them to participate in society.Yeah, this film does sound a lot like the X-men, except it seems to be much more consistent than the other franchise, at least with the powers. The original concept of the X-men was based on the conflict between the African-American minorities, and the two factions represented those led by Martin Luther King, and the Black Panthers. This film seems to portray the powers as being similar to Mexican-American immigrants, who spend their time as day labourers and will pick up whatever job they can get, though of course there are police patrols going around making sure that none of them are illegally working.The film is focused around one particular power named Conner who, while looking for work, finds himself caught up in the criminal underworld. Once again, there seems to be a strong reference to the Mexican-American underclass, with the suggestion that a lot of them run criminal organisations and are basically drug dealers. However, the drug in this movie is a drug called Psyche, which is obtained by tapping the spinal fluid of powers.It was a rather interesting film with a somewhat ambiguous ending as well. I guess it was difficult to see what actually happened in the end, though of course the antagonists did eventually get dealt with. However, it does confront the idea of racism, and the fact that the laws do tend to work for some people, and against others, and sadly the ones that they tend to work against are divided along racial lines. Mind you, that can be a little simplistic though as it does tend to be a lot more complex than that, but it does confront us with the fact that we do tend to engage in racial stereotyping, and that not all people of a particular race are bad, just in the same way that not all people of another race are good.",Code 8

15,southdavid,Code Of Ethics,6,18 May 2020,"Another lockdown night unable to decide what to watch, another movie that Netflix advertised heavily for a while that I eventually caved to watching. It was an acceptable way to pass a couple of hours, but I don't think I'd recommend anyone going out of their way to find it.In a city where people with powers have been demonised and marginalised, Conner Reed (Robbie Amell) is unable to find a job, so operates as a day labourer to try and find the money to pay his mother's medical bills. He's offered the chance to join a criminal gang and make a lot of money very quickly, by Garrett (Stephen Amell) but the heights of Conner's power soon has people on both sides of the law looking for him.There are a few aspects of ""Code 8"" that work pretty well. The performances are pretty solid across the board, with Robbie Amell as a competent lead and his cousin a charismatic introduction to the criminal underworld. There are a host of other recognisable faces around the film, which is impressive for its status as essentially an indie film. Sung Kang from the Fast and Furious films, Greg Bryk from ""Frontier"" and Laysla De Oliveira from ""Locke And Key"" all crop up. The visual effects of the film are pretty solid too, there's nothing too spectacular, but certainly for the budget the CGI work is really good and the practical stuff is decent.But I feel like the creative forces behind the film are a bit too convinced that there's a world of stories here than they really should be. It is, let's be fair, largely a rip off of the ideas presented in the ""X-Men"" and the film goes a bit further than it needs to into explaining the lives of its various protagonists and antagonists. Maybe that's with one eye on the Quibi series that is allegedly coming, but it makes this film too long. It's all a little too pedestrian to really hold my interest and ends with an underwhelming and occasionally confusing climax.I don't want to come across as too harsh. It's not a bad film, but decidedly average.",Code 8
16,alindsay-al,A Below Average film with wasted potential,4,15 April 2020,"This film is one of the most watched on Netflix at the moment so I decided to watch Code 8 and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a superpowered person attempt to raise money for their dying mother by making some questionable decisions.
Main Character
Robbie Amell plays the main character and he does an okay job in the role, he has soem charisma too him and I did care about him in the role. However, his character just isn't particularly interesting, his motivations were pretty bland and they didn't help make him a great lead for this film and just serviceable at best.
Supporting Cast
The main supporting character in this film is Robbie Amell's cousin Stephen Amell who is most known for playing the character of Oliver Queen on Arrow and he does a good job in this film and has the best performance in the film. His character does have shades of his character on Arrow and I am worried that after time he is definitley going to be type cast in that role but he worked for this film and thought his character was the best in the film. The rest of the cast though are really underdeveloped and you aren't given a reason to care, whether its the villains, the crew, the police or even his mother I just didn't care about anybody else and it hurt the film for sure.
Story
Unfortunatley, this films plot is extremely basic but for me it just feels really rushed. There have been rumours that this film was made to set up a TV Show and it is clear a TV show would have been a better idea as some stories and characters aren't given enough screen time or depth to make you care. Also the end of the film is clearly trying to set something up as none of the characters get an end to their story arcs and it ends incredibly abruptly.
Script
The script is extremely bland, there is absolutley no memorable dramatic dialogue in it at all and a lack of humour anywhere in this film and possibly embracing it's slightly cheesy style of a film.
Style
This is easily the best part of the film, the style has some great ideas to it and it feels like this film wastes great potential. The design of the technology and the use of the superpowers is really unique and I liked how it was portrayed, the action scenes were exciting enough and the uses of powers worked and I thought this film introduced it well hopefully with more of this franchise to follow.
Overall
Overall, this is a below average film, if you are looking for a film to watch to turn your brain off then this could be enjoyable but for me this film has so much wasted potential and if we do get this series in the future I hope it focuses up and improves on this interesting premise.",Code 8

18,iquine,Its Confused By Its Own Story Lines,5,24 December 2020,"(Flash Review)The world is inhabited by normal humans and humans who have assorted special powers. It appears people with powers are rooted out from regular jobs, by big brother authorities, over some fear of them (underdeveloped). Hindered from working and living in poverty, the protagonist young man takes a few shifty jobs, using his powers, to make ends meet and help care for his sick mother (underdeveloped). If they have these powers, how are they living at the bottom rung of society? (underdeveloped) Additionally, there is an underground drug market for a hip drug derived from human spinal cord fluids; a plot point that seems to have less impact than was anticipated as it was abandoned. The entire movie seems to lose its steam toward the end as its early key points, held in short-term memory, are forgotten about, while the more bland story line ends up being the crux but lacks any emotional impact. It did have solid special effects and nuggets of intriguing ideas. Needed another script or editing review.",Code 8
19,Pairic,Mutant Noir,8,12 April 2020,"Code 8: There have been many dark Mutant films and tv series' of late, mostly from the Marvel stables. This a refreshing low budget production which focuses on mutants on a ""human"" level. Mutants are feared and exploited in Lincoln city, increasingly laws drive them into the casual labour market and curb their activities. Police use drones which drop killer robots to deal with mutants who step out of line. Reed has electrical powers, just wants to earn a living but even off the books jobs are raided by the police and he starts to work for a crime boss. Then his mother falls ill and he has to engage in more serious criminality if he is to avail of the services of a healer mutant. Given the low budget the robot scenes and mutants using their electrical, telekinesis and levitation powers are impressive. Co-Writer/Director Jeff Chan delivers an engaging Mutant-Noir tale. 8/10.

20,s3276169,Reasonable film with a poor message.....,5,17 December 2019,"The key character is a power, with super human abilities who is discriminated against by an authoritarian state. He's deprived of decent work, treated like dirt by authorities and denied healthcare for his terminally ill mother.So when he turns to crime as his only choice to try and save her, somehow when things turn sour its exclusively his fault and by letting that same state incarcerate him its all made right?If that sounds like crap, that's because it is.Indeed, there are many ordinary people right now who are are treated like just this and if its anyone's fault, its a society that elects the worst kind of people, to represent it.On the upside the special effects are decent, acting is good and action is well done. That said, the underlying message is a poor one, that blames the desperate, for being placed in a position not of their making.5/10.",Code 8
21,lemon_magic,Goes through the motions in an enjoyable way.,7,16 May 2021,"I see a lot of comparisons to the ""X-Men"" movie franchise for this movie, but it also reminds me of the 2009 movie ""Push"" (with Chris Evans), except that ""Push"" was set in Hong Kong and felt a lot more exotic. ""Code 8"" doesn't feel nearly as futuristic - it's just Toronto or Vancouver with drones and mutants .The real problem with the movie is that it has a 2nd hand ""received"" quality to everything. You've seen everything here 100 times before, and the movie makers are relying on that to lend their dialog, characters, and special effects more impact. But in their favor, the tropes they ape and borrow are aped and borrowed effectively, so if that's what you want from your entertainment, this will go down fine.I quite liked the actors, especially Connor (handsome and earnest in a Dean Cain way), Connor's mother, Garrett (also handsome and as ""good"" as life will let him be), and the bald-headed invulnerable guy (who was just fierce looking in an interesting way). Everyone else was at least decent, with the possible exception of the actress playing the Healer and Detective Park's sidekick, and I am willing to cut them some slack due to the thankless, cardboard characters they were playing.So - for a low budget, standalone glimpse into dystopian Vancouver, this did a lot of things right, had a good balance of action, drama, and humanity, and was worth 100 minutes of your time.",Code 8

The premise is great (even if simple). In the movie, the discriminated are the ones with powers (representing really well the poor in the real world). With no options, they get forced to find a place in the world of crime as a last resort.But that's it. Because soon enough the movie turns into a singular story of the protagonist and his attempt to save his terminally ill mother. Everythign turns ultra cliché action thriller movie, but with super powers. The worst part is that there aren't any surprises. It's too predictable, even exploring the same themes every superhero show touches on: killing is off limits, being a criminal for a good cause can be good?, what's the limit to be good and criminal, etc.It would be normally a 5 points movie, but that score was too pathetic, even considering the budget, so I took one more point off.",Code 8

35,SoumikBanerjee25,A Genuine Effort!,7,24 September 2020,"""Code 8"" is remarkable. Keeping in mind stringent budget allocations, it is unquestionably a well accomplished endeavour that strikes more positives & did so with compelling determination!I'm an Indie Enthusiastic, nothing makes me happier than an Indie movie doing great! Cause I feel, with your boundaries and limits well known; one could thrive on their prospects more than the others!
Even with all the money being crowdfunded, the outcome never felt cheap nor anywhere close to sub-par standards!
The makers have made sure that their look & feel is unscathed throughout! And that's commendable to say the least!As a Sci-Fi Action entertainer, it delivers enough of both worlds! I was duly entertained & nor once was I got bored! Although I would have loved to explore more about the futuristic world they created.
I feel the narration was flawed in regards to its non-existent elaboration.

47,stevenrotherforth,Would have worked better as a TV show.,6,17 January 2020,"Code 8It is obvious that this Indie Sci-Fi from Director Jeff Chan takes inspiration from the X Men franchise but it also has a Neill Blomkamp vibe.
Set in a world where some humans have extraordinary gifts.
These powered individuals live in poverty. Their gifts are more of a burden and anyone caught using their special abilities must answer to the law.
A powered construction worker played by Robbie Amell falls in with a criminal gang when he desperately needs to raise money for his sick mother.As aforementioned this film is heavily influenced by the X Men movies but it does have its own unique premise.
Sadly the execution of this premise is slightly lacking.
Performances by all are commendable. The audience will grow to care for what happens to those onscreen due to some decent acting.
However this story would have been better told as a TV series rather than a 1hr 38min movie.
The world which is created onscreen is one that can be expanded upon.
An episodic TV show would have allowed the created universe and characters to flourish.
I have read somewhere that Robbie and Co-star Stephen Amell are actually developing a continuation for the small screen.Considering that this films production budget was crowd funded and was only a measly $2.1 million the special effects are really quite impressive.
This is where the Neill Blomkamp vibe becomes apparent.
The robotic police officers in the movie reminded me of the robot designs in 'Elysium' or perhaps 'Chappie'.
But it is painfully obvious that it is just a man in a suit rather than a CGI creation.
This is where budget constraints are visible.
Still the aerial shots of the drones deploying the robots was rather cool.
This is a film that does punch above its weight in terms of the visuals effects.'Code 8' is certainly worth checking out. It's probably a movie that won't linger in the memory banks for long but the expansion of the universe created by this film in the form of a TV show would be most welcome.",Code 8

While presenting a story consisting of rather familiar arcs and themes, it's still packed tightly and driven forward by decent characters, good acting & well done special FX. It reminded me of the very recent indie feature ""Freaks"" - both of these movies deal with the x-men-esque story about humans with abilities & their trials and tribulations in the common world. Both movies are solid.""Code 8"" is a tale about Connor Reed (Robbie Amell), a man with certain abilities, living in a world where people like him are being suppressed. The desperation created by the circumstances around him drive him to risk his life and safety to make money, and so the many endeavours ensue. As I previously mentioned, the story is built of arcs and themes which are routine enough, but ""Code 8"" has a lot to compensate with. For starters, the (also familiar) characters are delivered by a cast of great actors, including the Amell cousins, Greg Byrk as the villain, Sunk Kang - whom I hadn't seen for a long time, and a likely overlooked performance by Kyla Kane. The most valued possession of ""Code 8"" is probably the special FX, cinematography and production design. For a movie of this budget it looks admirably awesome, the style is on-point and contained, no overkills, no on-the-noise cheap frames or visual solutions, might as well be a big-screen flick. Sound design's up there as well.""Code 8"" is like a humbler, more focused indie ""X-men"", a solid directional effort in the sci-fi genre that's not by any means flawless, but delivers most of what it promises.

You've also got a protagonist who's doing crime in order to save a loved one. I've seen this type of plot all the time, and I would say that Code 8 is right in the middle of the pack in terms of quality. And because the plot is so cliched, the movie gets very predictable near the end. The acting is pretty decent too; it's quite common for these movies to have terrible acting performances, but Code 8 is solid in that department.

Some just hate Sci-Fi but this movie had decent character development, a novel idea as to the 'powers' that were the main story. I enjoyed every minute, good action, keeps you interested and good actors. Haters be damned this is worth a watch. Certainly better than a trashy Seagal or Van Damme movie and given that it seems the average ratings on IMDb are sooo low of late.. seems like 7/10 movies are ranked 5 or less and if you buy into all those ratings then you'd have to come to the conclusion that very few movies are worth watching these days. If it's not a big budget splash then rankings here and elsewhere are so very low. That just tells me there are a lot of 15-35 yr olds who likely haven't seen a hundred movies between them and who are extremists like the old Rex Reed hater type wanna bees and get a kick out of bashing a movie. I'm literally a film aficionado and I rarely can find a film I've not seen.. so I've seen thousands upon thousands of movies. My watching time frame spans 50 yrs and I can tell most these reviewers are very young. They don't know what bad movies are until you've seen several hundred westerns from the 40's- 70's (and evening those I remember fondly)...or if you want to see some crapput sci fi look at those same years for mindless movies. We are lucky to have such a high number of films coming out in this day And time and since that's all I do (Watch movies) I have to say we are seeing many more Okay, average, good and great movies than we ever did in those early yrs. Be grateful we have so many movies to watch these days...Until you've watched at least 7,500 movies you've no business ever leaving a review on one because you've such a minimal base to compare them to.

56,WalkdenEntertainment,Code 8 Means It's Something Fresh for Sci-Fi Fans...,6,14 January 2020,"Set in the present day, a select amount of humans are born with powerful abilities. Some are capable of reading minds, some control electrical power, some have super strength and so on. The world is a broken place. With current poverty rates at an all time high, many are addicted to a drug which comes from the spine of those with special powers.But Code 8 focuses its story on something unexpected.A young man, Connor (Robbie Amell), has the ability to control Electricity. He spends his days using his powers on a construction site to earn money and he generally keeps to himself. However, when Connor's mother is suffering from cancer, he becomes eager to urgently earn money for her to have proper treatment. Connor soon accepts criminal work from Garrett (Stephen Amell) who promises him big cash rewards.The world that is created in Code 8 is pretty awesome. It is a film set in the present day, but because many humans have powerful abilities, the world has more of a sci-fi vibe than ever. One example is the large police drones that fly around the city, equipped with robot police officers (Guardians) that drop into combat.
As a plot, there are many elements that may seem familiar and movie lovers may compare ideas with something like X-Men etc. Thankfully Code 8 brings a slight touch of freshness to the screen. Perhaps it's the added Sci-fi aspect snuck into the film that keeps it slightly fresh.Performance are enjoyable, particularly from our two leading actors, Robbie Amell & Stephen Amell (who funnily enough are cousins in real life). Whenever the two share the screen I found their performances rather pleasant to watch.The film overall builds a solid plot and story but struggles with the ending, particularly in the final moments which don't quite feel rewarding. Side stories are also never explained and some elements in the ending just don't quite add up for me. This issue of this film not being able to finish its ending correctly actually hurts the final product and the investment given by the audience. Prior to the ending, I was expected something more rewarding from the story and key characters.Overall, I'm grateful to see a film that has brought some creativity, along with generally new and fresh ideas. The film's sci-fi element was also a welcome touch. The film's final moments however do feel weak and unpolished. Fans who love a tale about X-Men/ Mutant-like characters will find some entertainment here nevertheless.5.7/10

1. Gives a character study of what world would be like with mutants.
2. Several of the secondary actors(Stephan Amells and Kari Matchat for one) do a solid acting job.Cons
1. There is no one to root for, everyone is different degrees of bad. You are either rooting for the criminals while they are committing crime, or you are rooting for the authority figures which are overdone unlikable characters that are okay with committing crime.
2. Main actor is the traditional good-looking male who thinks acting is brooding in front of the camera(think Twilight, Maze or any other YA films where actors have one mean bratty face for entire movie).
3. Major major plot holes that two ounces of common sense would rectify.

Yes, it looks every bit as professional as any feature should, but that still doesn't make up for poor casting.
The lead, Arrow dude's brother, is too old for the role - I think at one point in the film a cop mentioned he was 25 and still living at home, yet he looks at least 5 years older. Another problem is that the woman cast to play his mother, looks 10 years older than him at the most! The special effects don't mean much when these are the visuals that niggle.Another problem was the usual dig at white men: of the two cops investigating, one is white and the other Asian... and, naturally, it's the white one who hates those who are different!

In his desperation he joins a group of power-afflicted criminals in a series of heists whilst the police get ever closer to thwarting them.The film puts a refreshing spin on the familiar crime thriller elements with the various powers possessed by certain characters. The abilities range from telekinesis, healing, electricity, amongst others, and each powerful individual is designated a class based on their level of power.The near future setting feels like an extension of one of Neill Blomkamp's sci-fi efforts, with robot enforcers, high-tech drones, and realistic CGI blending with practical effects to make the film look more expensive than it is.

There are social issues touched on which again is not original but I liked the world that was created and a lot of the social issues can be paralleled to today in terms of immigration, social inequality, cost of healthcare.
The sci-fi touch in terms of use of drones and android cops was also a believable touch. Also liked how people with powers were not too powerful like in the actual X-men series and could only be specialised in one area.
I would rather have watched this than any of the recent Marvel X-men movies as it was more grounds in reality.

This movie is fantastic because it hits you with a tried and tested formula from things like x men powered people despised and hunted etc. but it does it in a way so different that it's unique it focusses on a small story with a lot of heart it has its cool sci fi robots and superhero mutant powers but that doesn't matter to the film only adds a little on to what makes this movie good.
What also really helps this movie is you don't expect it to be good while true it might come off as a generic sci fi movie and it not being action packed probably dissapoints some viewers which I'm sure is the reason for the lower score but it is an effective movie with great character development and world building despite not been too long a movie the characters and world progress so much I would even say enough to warrant a sequel.

It felt like it was an older movie and i thought that there would be more to it than what just happened in the movie. The characters and everything like that as well as the story was good and i liked it but i still thought it could have been better. I also like the whole idea of the superhero and all the different powers they all have, it has a good realistic take on all this and thats good.

Honestly wouldn't mind this to have had a chance of part 2 or even a TV series to it. Then again the way it ended there just might be a part 2.

I thought they seemed realistic and as good as any x-men effects. The plot and story were not unoriginal but they have definitely been played out in other film genres. So for that the film was a little predictable. The actors all did well and casting seemed legit. As stated before, the special effects really made this movie work and looked realistic. You could tell the producers worked hard on this because the end result was a pretty tight, gritty little movie, with a well written script, and enough twists and turns, special effects, murder and mayhem, cops and robbers, drug busts, killer robots, cool drones, mutant battles, gun play and action, plus some back stabbing, etc etc to make most folks enjoy it, but in the end its still a love story....and only a fair one at that.

91,FixedYourEnding,Unfilled potential,6,10 February 2020,"Code 8 is a down-to-earth X-men movie. Being an indie and not a big-budget films puts it at an immediate disadvantage, as far as limit of effects, paying for marketing, acting talent etc. What it should not be limited to, is writing, and for me, it was disappointing. Nothing really out of the ordinary that you can't find in any mobster movie and the ending is pointless. At the end I was like ""what? that's it?""Somebody mentioned it would be better as TV series, I tend to agree. Character development is lacking, nothing extravagant or shocking really happens. But what bothered me most was the attempt to paint a picture of a world with mutants, which is not rare (basically everybody in the movie turns out to be a mutant of some kind, or have a mutant in the family) but somehow they are all poor, cannot work and turn to crime, instead of advancing the human race they are all living in dumpsters? I don't know what would happen in a world like this but X-men makes more sense than this movie.Please if you make an indie movie make sure the story is top-notch, otherwise you just end up with a not-as-good TV level series. A slightly better attempt in this area is the movie ""Freaks"", it is also not Oscar material, but at least it has some more heart in it and some novel ideas.

This one was on a very human scale and again all the actors did a great job.I appreciated how the plot parallels social issues in society but it did not jam it down your throat. It was subtle and really got you thinking about the mechanics of how certain segments of society are discriminated against, and how we are coaxed along with complicit news cycles to do so.Just know this isn't the typical annoying PC lecture-fest.

Along the way SPOILER he meets a nice girl, works with sleazy bad guys as well as a not-so-sleazy one (who one suspects is an undercover cop) etc. So .... by my reckoning, being an old hand at watching B sci-fi movies, here is what I figured would happen, among other ""obvious"" things: real bad guys get punished, good guy saves mom, and gets nice girl too, SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - but none of the above happens (other than some bad guys DO get punished but others get away with it.) I admit I was very surprised.:) So while I actually felt a bit let down, I have to give this film high praise - it is nervy to turn so many cliches upside down. There is also a decent, if very derivative, sci fi setting - we've seen drone law enforcement and unexplained ""enhanced"" people before (The 4400, plus any superhero stories) - which work here even if there is little novelty.

106,imdb2-5,A good try for a self-funded movie,5,23 December 2019,"It's sad when you see something with potential go south so quickly. From the outset, the setup of the concept of human beings with special powers was presented in a very murky fashion. I let it slide to suspend disbelief. But as you move forward, it is incredibly difficult to believe that a world this technologically advanced conveniently lacks simple security cameras and alarms. Armed robbers forget to use masks? As a result, a movie that makes great use of production budget and reasonably decent acting makes for a challenging watch at times.The world you are shown features people who have superpowers. Yet those who like them are somehow still in control of this world we are to believe is Earth. It's like stepping through someone's cool ideas that might make for an entertaining 10 minutes short but not an entire movie, which needs to continue to sell credibility. And that's what this movie unfortunately lacks at times - proper development and creativity.The premise is that our protagonist has the superpowers and a sick mother who needs money to survive. Our honorable protagonist gets involved with a band of thieves with superpowers. People with superpowers are somehow the lower class, the weaker class. From there the movie progresses as our hero become stronger and forms a closer bond with the underworld.From reading the credits of this film it is apparently funded by indiegogo money. Good for the actors who starred in this movie and try to make something of it. But they would have benefited greatly from some type of input that might have alerted those in charge of the major plot holes. Perhaps they were just dismissed, I don't know.So I really like the effort that went into this movie. I like how much they were able to pull out of a relatively small budget.

acting - 9/10, no big names yet characters believable
action - 9/10, would throw in the last star if there was an extra action scene, but don't be fooled is a slow movie, it's just not avengers level

romance - 2/10, slight potential but not a date movie

Forget racism/super powers, if you or I behaved the way he does in this film we would encounter the exact same problems he does. Oh no, his mother has a crummy job with a jerk boss. Yeah, so do about 80% of working adults. That doesn't mean you can curse them out and threaten them. Suck it up and act like an adult.Wait, using super powers to do electrical work or other regulated technical tasks requires a license? You mean, like, an electrician's license?

134,filmsbyq,Super-powered fun outside the MCU,7,6 May 2020,"Code 8 is an entertaining thriller with good performances from all on show. With the popular superpowers genre in full swing and social commentary also very popular, combining the two - a staple of comics through the decades - is a recipe for a strong basis to make a film on. Stephen Amell does not stray far from his Oliver Queen/Arrow persona and it works perfectly well in the framework of this film.Robbie who, unlike his cousin, is not so defined by one role, continues to show that he is a capable screen presence. He is totally believable as the struggling to find his place Connor. The social commentary is that most popular parable of oppression for something that is beyond one's control and is only touched upon in the film.Truth be told, Code 8 is not a film trying to change the world, leaving the preaching of such messages to more cerebral fare. Code 8 is a superhero film in reverse. With Connor as the central protagonist whose only drive is to save his mother, it does not really take in the treatment of other super-powered people beyond the intermittent newscast and Abrams' Davis obvious dislike of super-powered persons.The film flows nicely through its ninety-eight-minute runtime, keeping you engaged up until the conclusion. Code 8 is by no means a perfect or great film but it is entertaining. With a screenplay by Chris Pare and story and direction from Jeff Chan, Code 8 is a perfectly serviceable actioner with a nod to social justice. It takes ideas from many other films but they are executed well enough not to be obtrusive. Code 8 is an enjoyable actioner to waste the best part of two hours on.",Code 8

It's a blatant rip off of X-Men, and not just because it's a movie about ""enhanced"" (mutant) people with special abilities, but also with their portrayal of them as being hated and feared by society and the presence of a special robot police force - the Guardians - used against them. That's an obvious Sentinel rip off.Aside from all that, the story is tired and lame. A boy turns to crime to help his sick mom. But this is no ordinary boy. He can produce and control electricity. He's not very good at it though because his mom raised him without teaching him to really use his powers. So another mutan...I mean....enhanced person teaches him to master his abilities in a rigorous 3 day training program where he has to shut off a car alarm and provide power to a half dozen floating light bulbs. There might have been an online certification class as well, but I can't be certain.This movie is full of plot holes, cliches, unnecessary moments, and abandoned arcs. It's also extremely predictable.

152,foxtwc,Interesting Story,7,15 September 2021,"This isn't a neatly packaged story like most movies where there is a tidy story that is told and a firm clean end is reached.This is more of a fly on the wall story to look at the characters lives over a few weeks time where decisions are made and consequences occur. Think of only being able to see the first few episodes of breaking bad and having it end part way through without being able to see the rest and that's about the reaction you will have. Some viewers will enjoy the view into the world but will want more ... some will be frustrated by the loose ends and will want closure and hate the idea they won't get it. Honestly they could turn this movie into a series to add more time and story to provide that.The world as laid out raises some questions about the ethics of how to treat people with super powers. Like xmen who asked to have mutants identified so they could be watched/controlled. In this movies world they see people with powers as dangerous and require them to have permits which those who are too poor cannot afford. And many with powers are poor because people refuse to let them work in honest careers. Overall average people just want people who have powers to be gone.The film explores one guys life who has a sick mother and they cannot afford to pay for medical treatment to cure her illness. And the plot revolves around what he would do to try and get enough money so that his mom could get treatment and hopefully survive.It did remind me of the game Infamous. The world is dark and the protagonist is both learning the extent of his power while trying to decide if he should hide his powers or use them for bad acts to make quick money.There are some hints at other folks who have powers but hide them in an effort to blend in. I won't spoil it but it's clear that a separation was done with a marriage that involved a kid who is having trouble hiding their power. The father is clearly able to hide his for obvious reasons.It's a great movie to watch the protagonist make his moral decisions along the way ... seeing him experience bad things yet still choose to go in deeper with more serious offences all with the hope of doing it for something good in the end.But that's the part that will offend most people. He makes bad choices but you do understand why he makes them. You want him to be a good person but the truth is his choices are bad, so instead you see someone who wants to be good get tainted by evil in his pursuit for money ... which he justifies as being necessary to save his mom.The reality is evil acts hurt everyone ... they also reinforce stereotypes against people with powers. Dealing with criminals to make a living never has a good side. And when you break laws there are consequences that have to be paid.Overall it's a believable look into the life of someone who has powers and must make choices to try and save someone when money is required. It's a gritty reality that some people who do try to help someone by doing something bad ... end up losing in the end (isn't that what happened in breaking bad).Just don't expect a neat plot line that has a beginning and a clean end. Your only the fly on the wall to watch the protagonist struggle with a moral and ethical life issue that results in him breaking the law with the motivation being to help his mom. Then you see the outcome of some bad decisions and a realistic situation faced by millions of people when you realize that life is hard and sometimes it's best to accept that bad things happen ... even though money can help it won't always save you ... everything has a cost and sometimes the price to pay is not worth it. This is reinforced by one scene where a decision is made to spare a strangers life rather than risk it for his mom ... he accepts that you just have to let go and let nature takes its course rather than hurt others.Honestly I would like to see more of the world and what happens to the guy. The ending of the movie is not tidy ... you are left wondering what happened because it's just a window into someone's life for a few days. The city the movie takes place in escalates their hatred of people with power. So you really would like to learn more about what will happen. You feel the ethical issues of treating a subset of the population that way .... Trying to crush them into poverty and non-existence.",Code 8

I loved the backstory and seeing the world that they developed based on these powers and whatnot. That being said, I think they could've done a better job with their idea. I think it would've been cool to see a police officer with those powers tracking down the drugs, I think if they turned it into a detective type movie, it would've been really cool. For the most part it seemed pretty unique and different, especially with the oppression that is forced into the people that have powers. That aspect of it was different to see, but it soon turned into an origin story type of movie. Main character has these powers, he finds someone who can help him, he grows in his powers, leads up to a big scene trying to take down the big guns, doesn't work, tries again and they win. Typical. But, it was still entertaining, I liked how it was more graphic than I thought, this gave a different more serious tone to the film. The ending didn't really seem to conclude the film, it was really open ended in that sense.

I didn't even remember half of them short of ""mute guy, pyro chick, healy girl (even though they tried to ram her down your throat), bulletproof monk and touchy feely guy.

They're limited like normal talents, like singing or painting or dancing, which is wonderfully, almost realistic.There's also real life issues, like prejudice and a biased legal system. However, being a short film that had to display these abilities, there's almost no time to develop characters.Open and foreboding ending, possibly opening the door for a series.

169,bs-33435,Good vision,10,16 December 2019,"The only one of two things that I really say negatively about this film is the premise as stated in the description of the film: ""Conner Reed (Robbie Amell), a desperate young man possessing special powers, clashes with a militarized police force after committing a petty crime"".
In no way shape or form are the crimes committed by the protagonist ""petty"" crimes, and it makes it sound like the major plot line of the film is the lead's conflict with the police, making me think I was getting another ""District 9"", whereas the film's premise is actually more about his conflict with organized crime.
That being said, I know this film was shot on a relatively modest budget, but it doesn't show. The film does some ingenious stuff to make it seem hi-tech and flashy, but using simple solutions to make it work and still look good. For example, the robot officers are obviously actors in costume, but it's done believably so that they ""look"" like robots, but without requiring 10 million dollar Marvel-ish CGI shots to accomplish the task. The film also introduces us to drone-like police helicopters that are probably 100% CGI, but they fly high enough in shots to avoid looking too fake. Other, more expensive films could learn a lot from the special effects used here.
The plot itself is simple enough, but it's an easy watch. The one other complaint I had about the film is that some of the emotional interactions fall flat, the lead's ""relationship"" with a young drug addict looking to get out seemed forced (maybe just bad chemistry between the actors?), and I'd never assume the lead and his mom were ever son and mother, it's just not believable.

And yet I thought the plot was strangely hopeful: the message to me was that 'you do what you can with what you have'.

I'm reluctant to rate the direction high only because it would seem the director has a great deal to do with the lack of focus in this movie.

The 'powers' (the name for people with superpowers) came across as realistic, normal people which is a nice change of pace from the more common exaggerated superhero movies.Code 8 displays the political side of a world with superpowers by showing how the public's perception of powers changes, how they're treated in society and their struggles. I like that similarities can be drawn between how Code 8's society heavily discriminate against powers and real world examples of discrimination against other ethnicities/sexualities. This may be why the movie felt so profoundly realistic.Personally, I felt like the story was decent but missing something.

The driving force of the plot is the main character being discriminated against and not being able to get a good paying job which in turn means he and his mom cant afford healthcare for her. But in the end the movie concludes bad healthcare is a good thing? Like, none of this would be an issue if his mom had proper healthcare but the movie is too scared to provide any actual commentary even tho the entire premise of the universe and the plot kinda demands it.It openly states that not standing up for yourself and others, keeping your head down and even simply accepting death is being ''good'' and ''on the right path''.
why exactly should we care about a massive chem company or a bank compared to a human life?
The writers are either too scared or simply unable to imagine anything different in a very interesting world they created.The role of women in this movie is simply depressing. They are merely there to suffer abuse for the guys development and motivation. Its depressing to think that all of these people working on this movie didnt notice this in 2019.

the power classes should have had a bit more explaining as you have a few classes but it does not go into detail about them
the ending omg the ending kinda really irritates me off it shows him at the police station did he turn him self in and was let go or did he chicken out shortly after that it shows him standing above his dead mothers grave, i would personally like to think he turned him self in but since he helped them with the bust he was cleared of charges,idk theres alot of ways this movie could go both good and bad would gladly watch a sequel or prequel",Code 8

He just doesn't fit the roll, plus he looks old like 30'ish. Why couldn't they make him like 23 instead? I got sick of seeing the character and it's not-adding-up scenario. I was looking for a BAM something changed to make the story change, but it didn't. It was sort of gradual, which I'm a writer, so to be honest I can't talk about that since I did this same thing in my novel. I never knew how if you did this way you MUST have a likable character, otherwise, I'm just yawning. So with that in mind, I just couldn't finish it. I didn't care about the main character, didn't care what happened to him. Cared about his mom, and the 3 supporting gang members, but him, ugh...LOL I gave it 6 stars because it's definitely worth watching.

I bought it as soon as I found out it was released because I appreciate creative people taking a new approach to thier art. Asking fans to help fund was a great idea back in 2016...

Both the Amell's are on point, but I would like to highlight Robbie Amell you've delivered on a darker mindset and I really hope people see your worth in such an on point delivery in you're acting Robbie and I really do see this opening up doors for both you and Stephen.Now with reflection on the more in depth power story, it was a really good watch, the showcase of what present day would actually look like if people did have powers and how society would like to handle them and how even the purest of people can walk down a dark road to see the ones we love get just an inch of help.Also, how good did those robotic landings look and the robots themselves.",Code 8

A thing some have been talking about was that it doesn't add anything new and while it is true, I also don't think it needs to. The movie is enjoyable to watch and it definitely had potential. My complaint with this movie is with the characters. The characters have little to no development or depth. Again I want to restate that it's not a bad movie, at points, you can feel as if the characters could be real people and connect with them. However these moments are cliche and very few. At it's worst, the movie will throw ideas in the air and never come back to them. Special effects are very well done and don't let down. The plot was generic but still enjoyable. Overall, this movie is good for casual audiences and people that just wanna sit down and turn off their brain for an hour after a long day.

(And let's not underrate Robbie Amell's fantastic performance and the emotions that you couldn't help, but be felt with him.) This movie wastes no time with fillers or stuff just to make it R-rated. Every moment has a purpose. Every scene drives the story. Every penny shelled out on this movie was well-spent. Being crowdfunded, they made sure the backers would be proud. This does not feel like a small, independent movie. Code 8 could easily become a franchise.

A cliche of hardships being mutant is redundant, film could have depicted a day in the lif of the black or asian society and that would be much more trustworthy and to the point.

The raw emotions that each character displays is right on the money; from Mary worrying about Connor using his power to Connor's determination to save his mother at all cost, to Garrett's need to prove that he is better than the terrible place Sutcliffe found him in, yet showing that he is capable of compassion and caring about people to Park's inner struggle about actually chasing down the power enabled.And as someone that has always been labeled 'different' and was raised in a lower class home, I can attest the struggle that is shown here is so authentic and real. These guys really make you feel their frustration at being shoved into poverty and their rightful anger at being misunderstood and looked down upon. They make you feel for them and make you understand why they feel they have no other option but to do what they are doing.I have seen a lot of movies this year, enjoyed many of them, but none of them have invoked the response in me that this one has. The Amell cousins should be very proud of what they have done here. And every actor and crew member and backer should, as well. I will watch this movie many times over.
