0,MartinHafer,Touching and inspiring....once you learn to block out the blaring soundtrack,7,22 August 2007,"I really, really liked this film a lot. It was a small little British film that somehow struck a chord and became an international hit. And I could certainly understand why, as although the story is very old fashioned (mirroring themes in films such as THE JAZZ SINGER, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN and Hollywood/BOLLYWOOD), the characters and style of the film made the whole experience come alive. With such a simple story, the director and writers did a great job of making the audience care about the characters--sucking you into the experience and touching your heart.Unfortunately, the film also was initially a chore to watch, as I absolutely hated the soundtrack and almost turned the film off soon after it began because it was so darn loud and distracting. I really can't think of another film where the music level was so loud. Plus, if you don't like the Euro-beat, it really became annoying. Fortunately, I was able to tune it out but I wonder if viewers even older than me might feel even more disenchanted with the music, whereas younger folk probably will not be put off by it. I like loud music (hey, Heavy Metal and Hair Band music is great), but not when it takes center stage with a film that required a little bit more subtlety.By the way, check out BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood. It's very similar to this film but is actually a better film showing the Indian experience in Canada. The family is Hindu (not Seikhs) but is very similar to BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM.",Bend It Like Beckham
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Very enjoyable, even with its problems",8,13 July 2010,"I am not into sports films as much as others, but I have enjoyed a fair few- Mean Machine, The Longest Yard(original), Hoosiers, Remember the Titans and this film. The footballing storyline can get predictable, such as the nail-biting finish resting on a penalty kick, and some of the romance is rather fluffy. However, there is much to praise about Bend it Like Beckham. It does have an opportunistic title, which is interesting in itself, while the concept is original and has the flavour of East is East in a way. The script does have its comical and heart-warming moments, and there are a lot of them, the pace is efficient, the direction is solid and the football is great to watch. I also liked how Bend it like Beckham was filmed, and the soundtrack which was exhilarating and drove the film even more. And the acting in general is very good, Parminder Nagra puts a lot of spirit into her title character and shows a considerable amount of skill as an actress and as a footballer, while Kiera Knightley is decent enough. My favourite though was Juliet Stevenson, who was a sheer delight as a Hounslow mum. Overall, very enjoyable and recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Bend It Like Beckham
2,SnoopyStyle,Great family movie introducing Keira Knightley,7,5 January 2014,"Jess (Parminder Nagra) comes from a conservative Sikh family. Her mother worries about her daughters and maintaining a good family facade. Her sister is getting married, but her mind is on football. Jules (Keira Knightley) plays on a girls team, and recruits Jess after watching her in the park. Jess starts playing despite her family's misgiving.This is Keira Knightley's big break out indie hit. It's the start of her wider fame. But it's Parminder as Jess and her family that is more fascinating. The family traditions and pressures are at the heart of this movie. The one false note in the movie is the girlie drama with Jules getting jealous of Jess and couch Joe. It reeks of lesser teen fare. But the movie gets over it quickly and moves on. It gets back on firmer ground of family drama. This is a heart warming little film.",Bend It Like Beckham
3,gavin6942,You'll Warm Up to This Film,6,9 March 2006,"For a while, I sat blank staring at the screen wondering why my friends had forced me to watch this film. But after that point, I wondered why nobody had made me see it sooner.You will have to adjust to the characters and possibly the accent (if you're American), but once you do, you will fall in love with these characters. The plot is simple: a girl wants to be a professional soccer player, but her family thinks it is not right for women to pursue soccer. You may not have strict parents or a love for soccer, but we all know what it's like to have goals and face the obstacles we must face in order to achieve them.By the way, it's Keira Knightley. She's a little thin for my liking in this movie, but her acting is fine, and heck - it's Keira Knightley, probably the biggest rising star in England today. You know you can't get enough of her (especially if you've seen ""The Jacket"").What I really liked is the angle of Indian and Sikh culture. That's certainly not what you expect from a soccer film. But it's all here: the weddings, the music, the weird old man in the weird painting... a little background in Sikhism or Indian culture would be helpful, but not necessary to enjoy this film.You can do worse. Recommended to watch if you're in a bonding situation (especially if you're two girls) or might be a lesbian. Everyone else, you can watch this film, too. I'm not a lesbian, and I enjoyed it.",Bend It Like Beckham
4,lee_eisenberg,I will always remember this movie.,10,8 September 2005,"As someone who's never been into sports, it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it, soccer)-themed ""Bend It Like Beckham"". But I gotta say, this was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I'm going to say it the British - and international - way) and just adore football player David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie). Okay, so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense, but you gotta love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of ""bend"" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (I'd also never heard of David Beckham prior to this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit it big: a few months after ""BILB"" came out in the States, she starred in the equally cool ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".",Bend It Like Beckham
5,jboothmillard,Bend It Like Beckham,6,26 June 2006,"It was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and I was keen on seeing it for Keira Knightley, and it was quite good. Basically Jesminder 'Jess' Kaur Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) dreams of being like her football hero, Beckham, and she is obviously really good at football herself. So one day her friend Juliette 'Jules' Paxton (Knightley) helps her get into a girls football team, coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). It seems like everything is going well for the team, and Jess enjoys it, but her parents Mr. Bhamra (Anupam Kher) and Mrs. Bhamra (Shaheen Khan) are against it. Not just because of their religion, but Jess's sister Pinky (Archie Panjabi) is getting, and they want her to be ready. Worst of all, their final match is on the wedding day, but everything turns out alright in the end, eventually. Also starring Shaznay Lewis as Mel, Frank Harper as Alan Paxton, Juliet Stevenson as Paula Paxton, and EastEnders' Ameet Chana as Tony and Pooja Shah as Meena. It was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, it won The British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Good!",Bend It Like Beckham
6,Tweekums,An enjoyable coming of age film,8,15 July 2016,"Eighteen year old Jess dreams of playing football like her hero David Beckham even though her playing is limited to having a kick-around in the local park. Here she is spotted by Jules; who plays for the local women's team. Jules tells Jess that she should try out and she quickly impresses Joe, the coach. She is invited to join the team but there is a problem; her Sikh family expect her to go to university and marry a nice Indian boy not 'waste her life' playing football. She tells her parents that she is going out to a job but it isn't long before they learn the truth. She manages to continue to play and Joe thinks that both Jules and Jess have what it takes to go to the top in the women's game. As well as the drama about the football there is confusion when Jess's family fear she is seeing a white boy, Jules' mother thinks she is a lesbian, Jules and Jess fall out because the both like Joe and Jess's sister is getting married inevitably the wedding clashes with the football final that is due to be watched by a talent scout from America.This film is a lot of fun even if the basic plot isn't the most original and most viewers won't be surprised at how the story works out. It does bring some interesting twists to the genre and the fact that Jess is a Sikh allows some stereotypes to be played with in a gentle rather than offensive way. There is more humour provided by Jules's mother as she is embarrassingly keen to show how open-minded and unprejudiced she is right up until the thinks her daughter might be a lesbian! The cast does a solid job; Parminder Nagra is really good as Jess and Kiera Knightly is equally impressive as Jules. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. The football scenes are decent enough; I enjoyed the way the scenes from the final match were intercut with scenes from the lively wedding party. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a decent feel-good film with a solid enough story and plenty of laughs.",Bend It Like Beckham
7,blanche-2,A young woman is torn between two cultures,8,4 October 2010,"Parminder Nagra wants to ""Bend it Like Beckham"" in this 2002 film also starring Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Set it England, Nagra is Jesminder, nicknamed ""Jess"" who loves to play soccer and is recruited into a women's team by a fellow player Jules (Keira Knightley). There, she meets the team's coach, Joe (Rhys-Meyers) on whom Jules has a crush.But playing soccer is at odds with Jesminder's traditional Indian family, so she is constantly lying and sneaking out of the house. Joe encourages her to live her own dream, but it's hard for Jesminder to break away from what her family expects. And with her sister about to get married, she's expected to help out. When her sister's wedding falls on the day of their big tournament where a talent scout from America will be present, Jess is forced to make a decision.This is a really lovely film with many warm and funny moments and situations. The beautiful Nagra, who was so good on ""ER"" is sympathetic as Jess, with Keira Knightley a feisty Jules. At one point, Jules' mother believes that Jules and Jess are lovers. A very funny performance by Juliet Stevenson as Jules' mother.""Bend it Like Beckham"" covers a lot of ground - compromising your dreams, going after your dreams, prejudice, looking butch, and the perception of women in Indian vs. modern culture. In the end, it's really a story of finding out who you are and not being afraid to state it.This is a family film. Someone mentioned that it is bashed on this site. I really can't understand that. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is - ethnic tradition versus the modern world and a young girl caught in between. No special effects, no enormous names, just a nice story and script with good performances. Very enjoyable.",Bend It Like Beckham
8,sunwarrior13,A Girl's Struggle For Her Dreams,10,7 April 2013,"Bend It Like Beckham is a comedy-drama film about an independent-minded young woman discovers the joys of football to the chagrin of her family. It stars Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Anupam Kher, Shaznay Lewis, and Archie Panjabi.It was directed by Gurinder Chadha. The title refers to the football player David Beckham and his skill at scoring from free kicks by bending the ball past a wall of defenders.Jess Bhamra is an 18-year-old growing up in West London, where her family has taken every effort to stay in touch with its Indian heritage. Jess' father and mother are after their daughter to go to law school, learn to cook a traditional Indian dinner, and settle down with a nice Indian boy,the latter of which is high on the agenda of her older sister Pinky, who is soon to wed her longtime beau Teetu. However, her family is unaware that Jess has a secret passion:football . While Jess' enthusiasm for football star David Beckham is obvious, given the fact his photos cover the walls of her room, her parents don't know that in her spare time she likes to play a friendly game in the park with some of the boys in the neighborhood. One day, while Jess and her pals kick the ball around, she meets Jules, who is quite impressed with Jess' skills. Jules plays with a local semi-pro women's football team, the Hounslow Harriers, and she thinks Jess has what it takes to make the team. Jess knows that her parents would never approve of their daughter playing football, so she doesn't tell them, and starts spinning an increasingly complex series of lies as she tries to keep up a double life as a student and a footballer. Inspiring, compassionate, and with a sly undercurrent of social commentary, the is a lively feel-good movie that genuinely charms.Nagra and Knightley have winning personalities, but credit should also go to writer/director Chadha for getting the balance right between humor and pathos, and sporting and romantic action.Also,it may be a formulaic and clichéd film but it does work and keeps the viewer entertained.",Bend It Like Beckham
9,Theo Robertson,I Wasn't Very Impressed,4,3 January 2005,"Like THE FULL MONTY this movie wasn't expected to set the box office alight but like THE FULL MONTY it became a massive international sleeper hit . BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is rather flawed and the flaws are very similar as the ones seen in THE FULL MONTY .First up is the amount of politics involved , concepts like sexism , traditional Sikh family values and even lesbian love are used to get a laugh but at the same time you feel the production is pulling its punches as to how acceptable this type of humour is in 2002 . If you're going to offend people please do it and be damned otherwise don't bother .This extends to my second criticism of who's side the subtext is taking. Forget the fact that Jess is brought up in a Sikh household and ask yourself this : What would your daughter rather be - An amateur footballer or a professional lawyer ? The screenplay seems to imply that Jess parents are in the wrong for wanting the best for their daughter Thirdly has anyone seen what genre the IMDb classes this movie as a Comedy/ Action ? Romance / and a couple of more genres . Again there's a bit too many irons in too many fires as to what this movie wants to be I wouldn't say I hated BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM but it's not a movie I'll praise to the high heavens either . I do concede that it's very much a ladette chick flick movie dealing with cultural norms and traditions and isn't really for my type of market . I will respect it as a British movie that made a killing at the box office but like so many Brit flicks ( Namely THE FULL MONTY and 28 DAYS LATER ) BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM could have been a lot better",Bend It Like Beckham
10,jotix100,English massala,8,26 June 2003,"Not being a football fan, I postponed seeing this film. It was a mistake because it turned out to be a lot of fun. It's not great, but director Gurinder Chada, whose work I have admired, keeps things going at a nice pace.Perhaps the best reason for seeing this film is Parminder Nagra, who makes her character, Jes, something we can identify with. Also in the cast Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, as well as Juliet Stevenson who is a lot of fun in whatever film she's in.All in all, a fun time at the cinema, even though you don't understand a thing about football.",Bend It Like Beckham
11,writers_reign,Pitch Perfect,8,13 February 2019,"I've been aware of this movie since it was released but I have an aversion to acting jokes like Keira Knightly and, to the best of my knowledge there was nothing and/or no one in the film that would offset her so more or less ignored it until, surfing the channels I came upon it as it was just starting. I began to watch it and found it unpretentious and charming in a low-key way and Knightly was unable to ruin it. Okay, it was Scripting By Numbers and it wheeled out just about every cliché in the book but it was undemanding and easy to like.",Bend It Like Beckham
12,Boba_Fett1138,Goal! But not an hattrick...,8,11 April 2005,"""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a movie that puts the ball in the net with several moments but also misses the post on others. Yet the good elements of the movie make up for the bad ones, which make this movie a good one and a pleasure to watch.I've always been charmed with Keira Knightley's looks but she never really quite charmed me with her acting abilities in the movies I've seen her in (""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""Love Actually""). Yet she pleasantly surprised me in this movie and I think it's fair to say that this is her best role till date. The rest of the cast is also good but it really was Keira Knightley that impressed me. I will certainly watch her future career with great interestThe story is quite formulaic and gets predictable at times. The whole race/culture issue is handled better in movies like ""East is East"". Still the story remains charming and sweet to watch, which is I think due to the acting, dialogs, humor and the easy atmosphere.It's funny, it's a sport movie but the worst scene's were in my opinion the football matches. The way it was edited was poorly, you couldn't understand what was happening on the field and all of the goals were so obviously staged that it was laughable at times. All of the football scene's were highly unbelievable and as a viewer you can never understand why Jess and Jules were regarded as big talents. Seriously, I've seen girls in real life doing way more amazing things with a ball (no pun intended). Oh and I can assure you that no football team in the world has so many pretty girls on one team but that's hardly a complain of course, because it's always a pleasure to watch Keira Knigthley and a bunch of other girls in a dressing room but it's just that it didn't made the movie really more believable.But still ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is incredibly good to watch and kind of is a 'feel good movie'. Just pure entertainment that also tries to give a message. It doesn't always work successfully and not all things are handled in the best way but it still is a good and charming movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bend It Like Beckham
13,evanston_dad,"No Big Deal, But Utterly Enjoyable",7,29 April 2005,"""Bend It Like Beckham"" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. Nothing wrong with this, however. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). Watch this movie and enjoy.Grade: B+",Bend It Like Beckham
14,ferguson-6,Even makes soccer interesting,8,2 August 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Have been telling myself for months to go see what all the hype on this film is about.  Now I get it.  It is a combination coming of age, clash of cultures, love story, strength of family and friends and ""Hoosiers"" and ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"".  VERY charming film with some nice writing and acting.  Keira Knightley (very different from her role in ""Pirates of the Carribbean"") is wonderful as Jules who befriends an Indian football talent and introduces her to the real game.  Jules mother is played brilliantly by Juliet Stevenson and nothing is funnier than her discussion in the car about her daughter possibly being a lesbian (Not that there's anything wrong with it).  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers does a bit too much posturing for the camera as the coach, but I do see potential stardom there. Not as hilarious as ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" but every bit as charming, this is a must see even for those who do not appreciate the european style of 'football'.",Bend It Like Beckham
15,anaconda-40658,Beckham Bends in the Right Direction.,6,3 June 2015,"Bend It Like Beckham (2002): Dir: Gurinder Chadha / Cast: Parminder K. Nagra, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Juliet Stevenson, Shaheen Khan: Refreshing foreign comedy about shaping character stranded between two factors. Parminder K. Nagra stars as a teenage Indian girl who has a talent for playing soccer. Her family is heavily into tradition expecting her to follow sister's path as she prepares for her wedding. She secretly plays soccer until she is found out and forced to make a choice. Effective setup addresses family issues but travels formula grounds. This has all been done before but with the location change it attempts to try something new. Stylish direction by Gurinder Chadha that is perhaps better than the film deserves. Nagra stands firm as the lead who shelters a secret life. How her situation turns out isn't that difficult to foresee. Keira Knightley is wonderful as Nagra's friend. Knightley's mother sees both girls hug and believes that they are lesbians. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Nagra's coach who sees potential but the role is pretty much standard issue with these films, and here it isn't too far off familiarity. The parents all behave like idiots with their religious beliefs that they attempt to shove down their daughter's throat. Religious elements are silly but theme regard realizing potential and bending it in the right direction. Score: 6 / 10",Bend It Like Beckham

When Jules discovers Jess, she invites her to play for the Hounslow Harriers and she does until her sister's wedding interferes with a tournament. Jess and Jules couldn't be anymore different. Jules is a white Briton who has a concerned mother played by Juliet Stevenson CBE. The film is about friendship and sportsmanship and family. It is a great family film and entertaining overall.

17,whpratt1,Great Entertaining Film,8,20 December 2007,"Enjoyed this film concerning a girl eighteen years of age who has become interested in a girls soccer team which is called football in West London, England where this film takes place. This young girls name is Jess Kaur Bhamra, (Parminder Nagra) who is the daughter of an East Indian father who practices the orthodox Sikh faith. Jess meets up with a girl named Juliette Paxton, (Keira Knightley) who plays on a girls soccer team and invites Jess to come on their team and she meets the male coach of the girls team, who is Joe, (Jonathan Rhys). Jess shows she has great talent and is accepted on the team. However, her family is very much against their daughter participating in any sports and therefore, Jess decides to keep it a secret until she goes to Germany for a soccer event. There is plenty of comedy, drama and romance and a wonderful experience of seeing the customs of East Indian people and all the foods that they prepare for themselves as a family. Great entertaining film and a wonderful production. Enjoy",Bend It Like Beckham
18,JamesHitchcock,Light-Hearted Sporting Romantic Comedy,7,4 January 2006,"In case any American viewers were baffled by the title of this film, I should point out that David Beckham is not merely the husband of one of the Spice Girls but is also Britain's best-known soccer player.There are a few other things about it that might also cause bafflement across the Atlantic, as (unusually for a British film these days) it was very much made for the home market with few concessions to American tastes. There is no big-name Hollywood star (Keira Knightley did not count as such in 2002). The plot centres around one sport, soccer, which is a minority interest in the States, and the script makes frequent reference to another, cricket, which is virtually unknown. There is no attempt to cash in on American enthusiasm for Britain's historic heritage; the film is set neither in a stately home nor in a picturesque village but rather in Hounslow, a rather dull West London suburb full of pebbledashed semis. (Malvina Reynolds's song about ""little boxes made of ticky-tacky"" was doubtless inspired by equally characterless American developments, but to me it always conjures up a vision of somewhere like Hounslow). The characters all have either West London or Indian accents, and much use is made of British slang. Finally, the film touches on a subject, inter-racial romance, that most Hollywood producers would not touch with a ten-foot bargepole. (The film-makers did in fact make one concession as the original script dealt with an even more controversial topic- inter-racial lesbian romance- which would really have had the moral majority foaming at the mouth).In form, the film is a traditional romantic comedy. The main character is Jesminder Bhamra, a pretty teenage Asian girl who discovers a talent for football and becomes a member of a women's team, where she falls for Joe, the handsome coach. As is normal in rom-coms of this nature there are a couple of obstacles to the love of the young couple; Jesminder has a rival for Joe's affections in the shape of her friend and team-mate Juliette, and her traditionalist Sikh family do not approve of her playing what they see as an ""unladylike"" sport or of her romance with a white boy.Writer/director Gurinder Chadha is able to use this classical romantic comedy formula as a means of commenting on a number of issues relevant to modern Britain. The relationship between the more westernised Jesminder (who, significantly, anglicises her name to Jess) and her more conservative parents is of great importance, as important to the film as her romance with Joe. The idea of a generation gap between traditionalist immigrant parents and more modern-minded youngsters has become something of a cliché, but here Chadha tackles the theme without resorting to the usual stereotypes. (The film does not touch on the reverse phenomenon which sometimes occurs among ethnic minorities in Britain, with third-generation children returning to their roots and becoming more culturally conservative than their assimilated second-generation parents). Jesminder's parents are not presented as the villains of the piece, but rather as anxious to try and resolve, if at all possible, the contradiction between their respect for Sikh traditions on the one hand and their love for their daughter on the other. Her father (very well played by Anupam Kher) is particularly sympathetic to her, remembering that he himself was, in his young days, frozen out of a cricket team by racial prejudice. There is a similar divide in Juliette's family, where her sport-loving father Alan encourages her ambitions, whereas her neurotic mother Paula (another good performance from Juliet Stevenson) becomes convinced- quite wrongly- that her daughter is having a lesbian relationship with Jesminder.The film touches on some serious issues about the relationships between the races, the sexes, and the generations, but it does so in a fairly light-hearted way; this is, after all a comedy, not a serious sociological tract about cultural identity. The ending has a rather sentimental feelgood tone, and the football scenes seem to rely on every cliché of sporting fiction, such as the heroine coming on as a late substitute and scoring the winning goal with the last kick of the game. Overall, however, this is a highly enjoyable film with two likable and vivacious heroines in Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley. Although soccer is the world's most popular spectator sport, it has never inspired any great films, and not many good ones. ""Bend It Like Beckham"", however, is one of the better ones. 7/10",Bend It Like Beckham
19,=G=,Didn't work for me.,6,1 October 2003,"""Bend it Like Beckham"" received good marks from critics and public alike. So, color me stoopid but I just didn't get it. The film played out like a long string of sitcom quality scenes sprinkled with Kodak moments, trailer moments, and Rocky moments in a busy format of criss-crossing plots with obvious ploys at every turn. A Brit-Bollywood combo built around football with the usual generation gap, culture clashing, etc. was quite simply boring with nothing new, stiff performances by the young protags, and eminently predictable throughout. However, I'm almost certainly in the minority here, so take these comments for whatever they're worth which probably isn't much. Enjoy! (C+)",Bend It Like Beckham
20,paul2001sw-1,"As good as Beckham (in Euro 2004, that is)",4,5 January 2005,"To watch 'Bend It Like Beckham' from the perspective of 2005 is to be reminded of a time when David Beckham was so popular that his name could be used to turn a low budget feature into a surprise hit. It's also to be offered an insight into West London's Asian community, by no means necessarily poor (or even, in some areas, a minority), and substantially British-born, but still highly culturally distinct. This makes the film a contrast to other movies about British immigrant communities such as 'East is East', whose focus is, more traditionally, on a family both poor and outnumbered, although the theme of generational conflict is shared by both. Unfortunately, unlike 'East is East', 'Bend It Like Beckham' fails to deliver much beyond its premise, offering no great insights, mediocre acting and dialogue and the clumsy over-use of both British and Indian popular music on its soundtrack. Moreover, the older generation is depicted unsympathetically, especially the women, while the younger characters are all beautiful and implausibly delicate, given that they are supposed to be members of a women's football team. It's always spritely but there's little on offer here beyond a simple fairy tale: a little more darkness might have added some bite. Beckham's name may have lent this movie his marketability, but in terms of quality, the film reminds one more of Beckham's miserable performances in Euro 2004 than his pomp of a few years earlier.

21,dromasca,A good mix of curry,8,20 December 2003,"The theme of the conflict between the Asian immigrants in the UK with their home culture and traditions with the British culture was well rendered in several good films during the last decade. Time has come for the commercial feel-good movies to take over the theme, and 'Bend it...' is a good achievement on this respect. It approaches the many complex and serious issues like racism, homo-phobia, man dominated professions on the easy side, and the plot is melodramatic and twisted towards a happy-end in a predictable manner. It is however well acted, it deals with sympathy with all its characters, and it never is dis-respectful for any of the multiple cultures it deals with. Sometimes exporting Hollywood clichees to European cinema works, and this is one of the cases. 8/10 on my personal scale.",Bend It Like Beckham

This is a wonderful comedy about immigrants adapting to a new culture while trying to maintain their traditional ways of life. While it is generally light hearted, there are poignant moments. Chadha's script does not veer far from stereotypes, but it still manages some keen observations. Nagra is quite good as the Indian girl. This film helped launch Knightley on a path to stardom.

I wanted to watch it for years because its original poster talked to me : two girls laughing playing football was really something that we don't see often ! Then, this year, i discovered that Keira was a great actress in « imitation game » and when i picked this one in her filmography, i just knew the time was come to watch it.Right from the start, i had good vibes : england, soccer, suburbs, community, friendship, values, traditions. It's really amazing how much the movie says a lot of essential things for every one and stays always accurate : sure parents can be stern but at the end they want only our happiness. Friends are people we met who are truly supportive of us. Sports are essential for our fitness as well as for our mind. Sure traditions and intolerance exist but there are peaceful solutions when we open our heart. This Indian teen is incredible and acts much better than very famous names. Keira is good and it's hard to tell then she would build such a successful career. So it was great to thrill for those teens, i had fun, i cried and i wish that i could have lived this same fairy tale at this age...",Bend It Like Beckham
25,meeza,Bending the Rules of Independent Cinema,9,29 December 2003,"`Bend It like Beckett' is the story of a young pitcher who led his Florida Marlins to an improbable World Series championship! Sorry! As a Marlins fan, I just had to pitch that one in there. `Bend It Like Beckham' is really the film of an Indian lass who dreams of playing professional soccer. However, her strict traditional Indian family forbids it. `Bend It Like Beckham' scored high with audiences and critics alike, and I can see why. The movie is the feel good film of the year. I am not saying that just for kicks. Parminder Nagra held no Indian reservations as  Jess our young protagonist, and demonstrated one of the top breakthrough performances of the year. Kiera Knightley of `Pirates of the Caribbean' fame demonstrated another swashbuckling performance in 2004 as Jess' teammate & companion. The movie's sidesplitting & sharp screenplay was like Beckham himself a spicy favorite. I commend Director Gurinder Chadha for her lively direction. Guys, it is time to bend the rules of machismo and spend a night with your lady watching this winning chic flick `Bend It Like Beckham'. ***** Excellent",Bend It Like Beckham

I suspect it has many sister movies in various other cultures across the world.This witty, comedic but perspicacious dissection of gender, sexuality, identity, ethnicity and body image never feels forced or sanctimonious. It is a friendly and fun story of a person that just wants to indulge a passion and is under a lot of pressure from both sides.As a child of the '90s I have this tendency to think sexism ended in the fall of 1988 and this reminds us of prejudices that women, as well as men have, in telling people who they can't be for various reasons.I'm tempted to say that every remotely subcontinental actor I've seen on British television makes an appearance at some point.A challenging but accessible feel-good movie that doesn't just cave into easy solutuons.",Bend It Like Beckham

This film is set in what looks to be a VERY prosperous Indian/Sikh immigrant community in a London suburb. Very good work by the entire cast, but particularly for the star, Parminder Nagra. I saw her understated charm in her recent role on ""ER"" so I decided to check out this movie. She was worth it. Yes, many of the same themes were explored in the recent ""Real Women Have Curves"" although that one carried a rather harder edge. This is a feel-good movie, and even if the plot turns were somewhat formulaic, they were done very well. I recommend. Grade: A-",Bend It Like Beckham

First of all, its not typical Hollywood product, which is a magnificent beginning, and you know that the director/screenwriter just had a vision of what kind of movie that they could make and didn't get all caught up in all that LA garbage you hear about.  They actually had a story to tell, had to sell it, and someone believed in the project. I found some of the romantic/dramatic subplots slightly juvenile, but I'm a 40-something guy so its kind of natural that kind of thing might annoy me at times.I'd only seen Rhys-Myers in ""Velvet Goldmine"", which I didn't enjoy, but here he's very good and has a lot qualities I like in an actor.  His eyes are very expressive and the camera picks that up.  You don't learn that, you just have it or you don't.  I like him enough to risk seeing the project he's doing for Woody Allen.  For all the sub-par movies Woody's made in the past ten years, I never once questioned his choice of actors, and I'm certainly not starting now.  Have fun with the movie.

They want her to groom herself properly in order to become a worthy bride like her older sister is about to be. Jess defies her family by going to secretly play ball for a local football team that consists of Kiera Knightley (who becomes her rival as well as her friend), All Saints singer Shaznay Lewis and Johnathan Rhys Myers as the team's coach.

It's developed quite well from the introduction of the character to the final conflict. All the other colors is just like what an Indian movie is expected to be, full of complementary characters, complications, and conflicts here and there. The depiction of cultural influence is very strong, just as in any other Indian based movies. Although one thing quite disappointed me. The title, and the first sequence suggest that there will be David Beckham in person not just after that short dreamy scene. I expected at least Jes can go to see Becks play on the pitch or the like. But the whole movie is just centered on Jes, with the least depiction of how Jes tries to have a decent bent shot. She just goes all the way like a striker goes, while Becks is really a right wing player. The action is just a typical, even with Kiera Nightly. Thus I think this is not that good of an entertainment.",Bend It Like Beckham
31,rosscinema,Contrived script ruins film,4,31 July 2003,"There are some things that I genuinely liked about this film but for every one item I liked I can think of three that I didn't. Story is set in London and an 18 year old girl who is a Sikh is very good at soccer but her parents are old fashioned and don't think their daughter should waste her time with such nonsense and instead concentrate on her sisters upcoming marriage and her own future as well. Parminder K. Nagra plays Jess and while playing soccer in the park with some boys a girl named Juliet (Keira Knightley) notices her and convinces her to join the girls soccer team. She meets her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and makes a good impression so now she is on the team. Her parents (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan) find out and forbid her from playing. She decides to lie and tells them that she has a job and this goes on for a while until her team travels to Germany to play their team. While in a German night club things get a little romantic between Jess and Joe and Juliet spots them and gets jealous. Jess's parents find out about Germany and get very upset. Meanwhile, Juliets parents (Juliet Stevenson and Frank Harper) think their daughter is a lesbian and is having an affair with Jess. One thing that I did enjoy was the lead performance by Nagra. She shows a real screen presence and maturity and displays a nice freshness to her role. She's a newcomer that everyone should keep their eye on. The scar on her leg is real and was written into the film. Also, the film does a good job of showing how diversified London is culturally and shows how large the Middle Eastern community is in that part of the world. But this script was just so familiar and to many of the characters are portrayed as old fashioned idiots. Its very difficult for me to believe that a Sikh family in this day and age would have such a reaction to soccer. And of course Joe is portrayed as a young and very good looking guy. Aren't all coaches? And the romance between Joe and Jess just does not come off as believable. Besides soccer, what do they have in common? The romance just seems so forced. And poor Juliet Stevenson! She's a terrific actress but she's forced to spew out ridiculous lines like ""Take your lesbian feet out of my shoes""! The film goes on way too long and I kept waiting for it to end. The last scene in the airport seems to go on forever. This is a film that didn't want to end. Say goodbye already! This film does have an undeniable charm about it and its because of the performances by Nagra and Knightley but the story is woefully familiar and contrived. There was not one moment or scene that surprised me for even one second. We've definitely seen this film before!",Bend It Like Beckham

It is great to see how a well cast and (especially) very well directed low budget film can be wonderful.

She lies and defies them in order to keep playing, but her deceit causes friction at home, while a love triangle develops between Jess, her coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and her best friend on the team (Keira Knightly). It may not be an original story, but it's a fun one that's frequently joyous to watch, and the focus on Indian culture made it seem fresh to me. The acting and soccer match scenes are equally well done, and the themes of culture clash and following one's dreams will be easy to sympathize with for most people. Bend It Like Beckham is just a good, solid, entertaining family flick to watch.

34,philip_vanderveken,"A very nice comedy, but probably not for the mainstream (European male) audience",7,29 August 2005,"I've always been very reluctant to watch this movie and there were several reasons for that. First of all, despite the fact that I'm just like the average European young male, I'm far from a soccer fan. It's just not my kind of sports, I prefer car racing. The second reason was the title. Of course I've heard of Beckham before, but despite what all other people think of him, I can only see him as a rather arrogant, often stupid looking guy who happens to be a little bit better in kicking against a black and white leather ball. Nothing special, so why should I want to see a movie that carries his name? Well, now that I've finally seen it, I know why and I also know that it is a shame that I didn't watch it sooner.This movie tells the story of two young girls that love to play soccer and that have to fight against a lot of prejudices in order to do what they like. Both girls are preparing themselves for one of the most important matches in their lives, hoping to get a transfer to an important American club, at least when they get the opportunity to play. One girl is from Indian origin, of the Sikh faith. Her family has been living in Britain for several years already, but they are very conservative and still very fond of their own traditions. They want their daughters to get married to a good Indian boy, want to see them walk around in traditional clothes and want them to learn how to cook traditional Indian food. When Pinky, one of their daughters, is preparing herself for marriage, but Jessminder, the other daughter, only has soccer on her mind, they feel very uncomfortable with this 'embarassing' situation. The other girl is a white girl. Her dad doesn't mind that she plays soccer, already happy that she isn't bringing one boy after the other home, but her mom is convinced that her daughter is a lesbian. What other girl likes to play football, rather than to go out with her mother to go shopping for clothes? When you are looking for some very dramatic scenes or a very deep story, than this isn't the movie you should go for. But when you want to have some lighter, but nevertheless very decent entertainment, than this is perhaps THE comedy that you should give a try. Depsite all my prejudices, I admit that I really had a very good time watching this movie. This could easily have become very preachy, telling us how hard life can be when you don't fit in, when you try to be different in the pursuit of your dreams,... I guess that, if this had been a Hollywood production, it would have become some kind of syrupy TV-movie. But the makers of this movie have done a good job, avoiding that obvious trap. The acting in this movie is very good as well. Before this movie I only knew Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Trey Farley and Keira Knightley. And they all did a nice job. But they weren't the only ones. The Indian actors were all very interesting and good as well. Big was also my surprise when I saw the amount of movies Anupam Kher has played a role in (222 at this moment). I don't know if this is exactly the kind of movie the average (European) soccer fan wants to see. I know that for instance my brother doesn't like it a bit. He's a real soccer fan and he still sees it as a game for men, rather than one that can be played by women as well. And he's probably not the only one with that opinion, so I doubt if it will appeal to that kind of people. However, when you are interested in the habits and traditions of foreign cultures, if you want to have a good laugh and don't mind the fact that this isn't exactly the most profound of all stories, than this is a movie you shouldn't miss. I certainly had a very good time with it and that's why I give it a 7.5/10.",Bend It Like Beckham

The story is simple, about an Indian girl called Jesminder Bhamra who is supposed to be doing 'female things'like helping her mother to cook or thinking about her wedding, but what she really likes is to play soccer. Not to mention that living in London, her soccer idol is David Beckham. Jesminder and Juliette start to be friends since both girls have many things in common. Or should I say way too much in common,when it has to do with the couch? Of course we do have many stereotypes in this movie,like Jesminder's family, but we cannot forget that even in the present days is quite common to have many conservative people and families.I really liked the ending, and I didn't expect that the couch would really have that big interest for Jesminder, what, in my opinion,makes the movie cooler.

She looks 18, but I think she's much older, she musta been 24 or so when making the film.  One of those uplifting movies very similar to Whale Rider, where the main star breaks with tradition and goes her own path.  Though not quite as good as Whale Rider, it's still the same string. It has some elements of Fiddler on the Roof here as far as the marriage plot goes.  I kinda wish there was more fun in america too, but it was alright where it ended.The reviews seem to make it like it's a hilarious movie.  Sure it's funny here and there, but it's a total drama.

The story is a simple one and you know how it's going to end almost as soon as the film starts, but it's still watchable and I can understand why some people get a lot of enjoyment out of a 'feel-good' film like this.It does play more like a sit-com than a film at times but I suppose that comes with the territory of a low-budget romcom. The humour is mostly fine though and the film does have some funny individual moments without being consistently laugh-out-loud funny.

I'm certainly no soccer fan, but Parminder Nagra completely won me over as the young girl Jess, who is trying to simultaneously pursue her dream of playing soccer and appease her traditional Indian parents. She is befriended by the gawky Keira Knightley, who recognizes the potential Jess has. Nagra accurately portrays the typical naiveté of someone with controlling parents, unsure of her own abilities. Nagra is believable and sensitive in her starring role. Knightley is used in support here, but she is equally as good. Both girls' mothers are caught up with traditional ideas of what their daughters should or shouldn't do, and this provides the comic fodder for the audience to feed upon. Here the fathers are the rational parents instead of boobs, which is otherwise too often the case in these kind of movies. Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Knightley's well-meaning but idiotic mother who jumps to one conclusion too many. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays the girls' soccer coach with his own parental demons.

It took me a long time to bother with watching it at all, because I considered it as an aspect of what I thought of as a 'cult of Beckham'.
The lionising of David Beckham as a footballer, as if there were no other big name players around.A daft rationale for not watching a film, especially as I'm not even a football fan. I suppose though using his name is sensible enough, to promote the film beyond purely football fans.
As Beckham's name is synonymous with the sport, probably beyond any other player, for those who may know nothing else about the sport.Looking at the film as entertainment, beyond my own daft rationale, I liked it its well scripted and acted, good all round entertainment.A particular point of interest to me, and something I've not seen mentioned elsewhere. Is the films perspective, from that of the young women instead of men. So many films sports based or otherwise, are from a male angle.I found it heartily refreshing for women to be the main characters, with the emphasis being on their relationship with the men in their lives, instead of vice verse.
We see young women endeavouring to succeed, in what even today is perceived as a purely male milieu.
Football is still predominantly a sport for men, the woman's game though getting deservingly more coverage, still encounters prejudice.We also see the attitudes towards them, from their males, dads, brothers, boyfriends, as well as those of the women, mums, sister, girlfriends.The social pressures of expectation, cultural, family and peer.

The film explores the similarities and differences between two cultures and the girls' common goal  to play soccer professionally.There were no surprises in 'Bend it Like Beckham', everything happened how I expected it would within the first five minutes of the film, but the manner in which these things occurred was refreshingly not banal. The two main actresses were basically novices when this film was made, and they exhibited a natural talent. Nothing stands out as fantastic or horrible in 'Bend It Like Beckham', it is just a basic feel-good movie that for some reason, probably timing, was a smash hit around the world. It is a fairly entertaining film, but not rocket science, so if you are looking for a film that you can just kind of stare at and not have to think about any deeper meaning, but not have your intelligence mocked or your time wasted, 'Bend it Like Beckham' is your movie.--Shelly",Bend It Like Beckham
46,hte-trasme,Didn't get too much of a kick out of it,4,11 July 2010,"I remember ""Bend It Like Beckham"" getting a lot of positive press and word of mouth when it came out, but having finally caught it some eight years later I must admit I wasn't really all that impressed. The story - - of a girl who wants to play soccer/football and find against her family's wishes -- is in its outlines as old as the stars, and this iteration doesn't really add anything to it. On the contrary, it spreads it rather thin across the running time of the film, so that we grow impatient waiting for events that we know from experience will happen to occur. Our protagonist is of Indian extraction and the film makes this a point to focus on. There are conscious allusions to Bollywood cinema, but rather than engaging with the tropes of that industry ""Bend it Like Beckham"" seems simply to repeat some of them somewhat unimaginatively. Worse, Jess comes packaged with rather shallowly stereotyped Indian parents, whose decision to change their minds at the end is pretty unsurprising. Some actors here are better than others. Keira Knightley and Anupam Kher are quite decent, but nobody is especially excellent. In fact, a lot of the acting -- especially that of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Joe -- seems to come from the school of thought that holds that if you mumble your lines as sullenly and casually as possible, they will sound realistic. Instead, it only leads to a number of irritating, phoned-in performances. The film is full of montages, often showing practices or travel scenes and always set to music. They seem to me more than anything like mini- music videos unceremoniously dropped into the movie, contributing nothing but an attempt to look cool, and slowing down the proceedings. While the main girl characters of Jules and Jess eventually tiff over their mutual affection, one can't help feeling there are a number of missed opportunities for drama -- had the romance been taken farther before the very end, had Jess confronted her parents rather than lie to them, &c. There are a few funny moments here, but the overall sense I got was of a film that was a little too artificial in its attempts to be inspiring.",Bend It Like Beckham

One of those siblings will be having an arranged marriage soon. Our hero gets involved with white people and before you know it, the culture clash is threatening to tear their family apart. Why is it that a tragicomedy like East is East, a love story like Ae Fond Kiss, and an (alleged) comedy like Bend it Like Beckham are all written off the same template? Aren't there stories amongst the British Asian community other than the clash of generations?Lots of people seem to have had fun with this movie, most of them adding the caveat that if you don't take it too seriously and don't expect Shakespeare, you'll have a giggle. Except, this film just isn't funny. There isn't one laugh out loud moment in the whole film. Nagra is drop-dead gorgeous, and gives a charismatic performance, without which this film would be sunk completely. But where is the comedy?And why does football seem to be so much harder to portray realistically than other sports? The baseball in Bull Durham, the American Football in Titans, the golf in Tin Cup - they all seemed believable to me. Football on celluloid always looks fake as hell.

Marketing and critical hype is a bit misleading, however, at least for me. I had been perceiving it as a kind of ""foreign"" movie, albeit entertaining and charming and likeable, along the lines of ""Monsoon Wedding,"" etc. Wow! Was that perception ever wrong! It is a masterfully executed movie, absolutely perched at the top of the entire heap of mainstream American and English movies. It is pure joy, superbly acted and put together. The Indian elements blend right in with modern life so smoothly that you will never think you are watching something instructional, or somehow educational, politically correct, or otherwise a school and art house version of something that is hideously dull but somehow ""good for you.""

I still don't understand soccer, but I enjoyed its presence here. And the world of girls' sports teams was also depicted wonderfully--- this aspect will be somewhat new for many people, including females. All of it was amazing!So, don't be scared of the foreigness--- it really isn't an issue.

We see a televised soccer match with David Beckham on the team, there is trouble getting the ball through, and suddenly a female player gets the ball and scores an unlikely goal, to the world's adulation. Well, except for when several sports commentators talk to the girl's mother, who is critical of her being in the soccer game in the first place and showing her legs to thousands of people. It was the girl's imagination, of course-and real life intrudes when she is called down to deal with preparing for her sister's upcoming wedding.Unfortunately, then comes a bunch of shouting back and forth, clichéd and not well-acted. A standard clash of Indian and English cultures, and it quickly got tedious, so we gave the rest a miss. The idea could have been done much better.",Bend It Like Beckham
51,sashank_kini-1,"This movie is about hopes & dreams dribbling their way past disasters. The film is well balanced - there's comedy, drama, romance, football and yeah, Beckham!",7,10 June 2013,"Indian 'Kudi' Jasminder dreams of playing alongside David Beckham one day (he doesn't need an introduction, I guess). She constantly talks to his poster, stuck behind her bed on the wall, like he's her best buddy. She maybe the only straight girl who doesn't dream of getting into his pants rather shorts, unlike those bimbos her sister Pinki hangs around with. She's pukka to her Indian roots in all ways, except her love for 'football-shootball'; that makes her mother Mrs. Bhamra go 'Hai Rabba!' (she turns like a typical Indian lady to the poster of Guru Nanak, the religious guru of Punjabi Sikhs, every time she hears 'Football'). Mrs. Bhamra wants Jasminder to get a husband and learn some cooking – who else shall cook roti-shoti for him but she, right? She has high hopes her younger daughter would marry Teetu, Jess's (Jasminder's nickname) friend since childhood. Of course, Teetu will never marry her – he's gay, still closeted. Teetu and Jess play football with a bunch of their Hispanic, Indian and Afro-American soccer buddies at a local park. Juliette or ""Jules"", an English girl is impressed with Jess' moves; Jules plays for Hounslow Harriers, a local football team coached by Joe, who's also her crush. Jules brings Jess to Joe and soon Jess joins Joe's team (hey, this could be a decent tongue-twister!) without informing her parents. It's totally a success tale for Joe and his girls on field, but it's the off-field drama that brings 'Bad News' every time.Everyone's got problems of their own, so Bend it Like Beckham never 'All About Jess', though Jess' definitely in s##t the most (in her own words). She's got the stuffiest family you can imagine (they seem stuffy to whites at least. To Indians like me, it's like watching home!) – a dad who can't forget his disaster past with goras (whites) and cares for Jess too much to see her facing a similar treatment, a mom whom we know of already but wait my notes also say 'she'll drop dead if Jess is found with a white man'; Jess' sister Pinki is better that the parents at least but she's the girl Jess would hate to become – the looks- obsessed bad girl who has no problems having sex in a car (Jess' shy to expose her bra even in a girl's locker room, but that also could be because her seamstress comments on one occasion that Jess' breasts look like mosquito bites!). Family's no-no to football – check. Then comes Pinki's marriage, and Jess can't keep her secret from the family forever; she doesn't actually, as she's caught often, but Joe somehow convinces her to play on.Jess does play on, mainly because football's her passion but also because she likes the lean and handsome Joe (cue thunder effect for Mrs. Bhamra). That sours up her friendship with Jules, who sees them almost kiss outside a club.Poor Jules risks losing Joe to Jess and her mother Paula Paxton doesn't make it any easier for her – she wrongly thinks Jules and Jess are in love! Paula does clarify that 'she has absolutely no problems with lesbians. She was cheering for Martina Navratilova herself', but that doesn't stop her from getting snooping around whenever Jess and Jules are together – the perfect prototype of a hypocrite. Plus she's Mrs. Bhamra's English counterpart when it comes to discouraging her daughter from football. 'Bend it Like Beckham' is all about hopes and dreams dribbling their way past disasters. What's best about this film is that it doesn't favor only one culture and acts bigoted against others. This makes the movie not just for 'Indians only', but just about everybody.It's a very balanced film – there's comedy in it, drama, romance, football and yeah, Beckham! The Indian humor has been tastefully sprinkled in to spice up taste-buds, the drama is appropriately light and breezy and the romance is sweet like juicy mangoes. Gurinder Chaddha, the film's director, scores a winning goal, and we're all here to cheer.",Bend It Like Beckham
52,lawprof,Making a Formula Work (and PAY!),7,24 March 2003,"Race relations in England are rarely actually funny (they aren't here either).  English directors and script writers go to considerable lengths, often, to depict cross-cultural clashes as amusing, frequently light-hearted and almost always resolved in a fair and happy way.  Perhaps there is too much rawness with white/black interactions for this approach.  Most British comedies that deal with race are centered on the East meeting the West (actually almost exactly the title of a successful such comedy of a few years ago too). ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is one of those formulaic drama/comedies of cultural meetings and machinations which, surprisingly, works.  Why?  Since the outcome of Jess's dilemma - ""How to Become a Female Professional Football Player of Indian Ancestry and Heritage Despite Parents' Near Hysterical Objections"" - would be predicted by Martians attending their first terrestrial screening, the movie rises or falls on the script and the acting.  And the cinematography.And ""Beckham"" makes it on all accounts.  Jess is a pretty teenager who plays football (I think it has another name but I confuse soccer with rugby, knowing nothing of either) in a verdant park when ""Jules,"" a lovely Caucasian scout for a girls' team recruits her.  Jess surreptitiously joins the team without her parents' knowledge, our rising star employing intrigue, a cooperative older sister, cunning and outright lies to bamboozle her unsuspecting parents. For a while.  Jess and her family live in an upscale home and neighborhood that I know few Indians reside in. 
Jules is a teenage girl any parent would want but few, I suspect, get. She's exasperated but engagingly tolerant with her mom (played wickedly by Juliet Stevenson) who embarrasses her in a lingerie department by trying to get her to use bra inserts so she will have a cleavage.  Her mom can't understand her passion for her sport while her understanding dad not only encourages her but expresses joy that she'd rather kick a ball than be chasing boys. Mom just wants boys for her daughter.  Are there mothers like that?Jules and Jess become close friends until, with cinematic inevitability, their individual attractions to their handsome coach (he's Irish to insure that all U.K. ethnicities are presented) leads to a rift.  Relating that is no more a spoiler than mentioning that the film is in color.The girls' team is fully integrated.  Race seems to be no issue at all. Yes, Jess has one unhappy moment when she's the subject of an epithet by an opposing player but any serious issues about discrimination and bigotry are outside Jess's and Jules's world. ""Paki-bashing,"" a neologism coined to describe a chronic and despicable crime, is absent.Jess's family is devoted to Indian rituals and social mores which, naturally, include an imperative that marriage be within the ethnic community.  Get what's coming up?  I'll say no more.  The families of Jess and Jules are shown in alternating scenes reflecting the director's clear wish to explore the supposed universality of parental love no matter what dishes are prepared in the kitchen.So despite the conventionality of the story, the sprightly acting and fast pace works.  It's a fun film.  It's been an extraordinary box office smash in Old Blighty and, supposedly, a professional girls' football team has been inaugurated because of this movie (devoid of an Empire, many Brits watching this film must have been stung by the repeated references to how good female footballers have it in the U.S.).The scenes of Jess's family life feature repeated feasts, meals and cooking lessons all showing glorious foods that I love.  So no wonder was it that when ""Bend It Like Beckham"" ended I propelled myself out of the Lincoln Plaza Cinema across the street to Sapphire, one of the Upper West Side's best Indian restaurants, and succumbed to the attentive service and outstanding food there offered.Do not miss the outtakes accompanying the screen credits.  And here's a new one: I'm always amused by how long the end credits are these days with every conceivable assistant listed.  But this was the first time I saw a name attached to the position ""Ethnic Publicity.""  Hmmm.7/10 (probably should be a ""6"" but I really enjoyed myself)",Bend It Like Beckham
53,movieguy1021,Bend It Like Beckham: 7/10,7,3 May 2003,"Although it most definitely will be compared to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it really shouldn't be. Even though both of them have a young person rebelling against their orthodox parents, Greek Wedding is a nice little slapstick romantic comedy blockbuster. Bend It Like Beckham isn't as much slapstick, but better in most every way, except it isn't as funny, and it's looking to be the next indie-blockbuster, which it shouldn't.Jesminder `Jess' Bhamara (Parminder Nagra, in a very good debut) lives with her mother (Shaheen Khan), father (Anupam Kher, star of over 100 Bollywood movies), and sister Pinky (Archie Panjabi) in England. She's a good football player (that's also called soccer), and she often plays with boys in the park, and she always beats them. One day, Juliet `Jules' Paxton (Keira Knightley) approaches her and asks her to play for the only women's team in England.She has to avoid her parents, because they don't want her to play sports, they want her to do housework, then marry a man and live a normal Indian life. Jess sneaks out of her house and pretends to be going to work. Meanwhile, Pinky is getting married. Much to Jess's dismay, her parents find out and Pinky's marriage is called off, because Jess is a disgrace to her family. Also, Jess loves famous British football star David Beckham, and has a crush on her coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).Bend It Like Beckham is a fulfilling and `winning comedy', as one tagline says. It had depth in the characters (unlike Greek Wedding, which just throws characters in). We got to care about them, and wanted to learn more about them. At many times I laughed, but it seemed to have too many serious and slow points without comedy in it. Although it had a more serous side than Greek Wedding, it didn't have to go that far.The cinematography at times was very good. It was spinning many times and was on a crane many times. One especially cool shot was during a match, when it was a first person view from a football. The music was very good, also. Something else that was good was the acting. Nagra gives a great debut, and she should be in more movies as the years go by. Knightley, who looked very sexy throughout the movie, did a performance that I didn't know was possible in movies like this. Kher and Khan were very funny, and I believed everyone for what they were in the movie. I would recommend Bend It Like Beckham if you like comedies that are both funny and poignant.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for language and sexual content.",Bend It Like Beckham
54,Min111,Strike it like Beckham,6,4 August 2020,"It's a comedy movie. Bend it like Beckham is about a girl named Jesminder Bhamra who likes 'soccer' or 'football', and dreams of being a footballer, playing for the local side. She is crazy about the sport, but her mother doesn't want her to play, and she doesn't for one bit approve of it. That's cause she's a girl, and football is meant for the boys - that's what she thinks. Her mother just wants her to settle. To get on with her studies, find a nice Indian boy to marry, and learn how to cook. She supports Manchester United. Her father, on the other hand, Mr Bhamra, is actually okay with it, and is very supportive of his daughter, especially when it comes to her studies. She's eighteen years old. Studying for her A-Levels, and her parents expect her to go to University to obtain a degree. Jesminder, however, has other ideas, and wants to be a football player by playing for the local women's football team called the Hounslow Harriers. The team is managed by a man named Joe. He happens to be her friend. She lives in Hounslow, London. She's also called by the name 'Jess' which happens to be her nickname. It's short for Jesminder. She has a sister who goes by the name 'Pinky'. Let's not forget another vital character named Juliette Paxton who also happens to be eighteen years old, and is the 'new' friend of Jess. She likes football, and happens to be a football player playing for her local side. She finds Jess playing football at the park along with her friends, one of them is Tony, and is very impressed with Jess's footballing skills. It's Juliette that 'invites' Jess to try out for the football team. Jess, meanwhile, is happy about the tryouts, and she gladly accepts the offer. Juliette, just like Jesminder, also happens to have a nickname. She goes by the name 'Jules'. The football coach, Joe, has doubts about a new player joining the team, but after seeing the kind of skills Jess possesses, Joe takes her on, and is now part of the team. Jess doesn't tell her parents that she's joined a football team, but her parents eventually discover that she has behind their backs, and are not happy with her. They're not happy because she lied to them. Therefore, the parents are strict, and ban her playing for any more games. Thanks to Jess and Jules footballing ability, their team make it to the finals. Jess's older sister, Pinky, however, is getting married, and the marriage ceremony takes on the same date as the final. Jess has a tough decision to make whether to attend and stay at the wedding, or to go to the football game, and participate in the final. The other character, Tony, pleads to Jess's father to let her go, and play in the football match. Mr Bhamra happily agrees. Tony then takes Jess to the finals where the Harriers are losing currently with plenty of time still to go. Can Jess get her side to win the final? You need to see it to find out. I think Bend it like Beckham is a good movie. It will get you laughing for sure. The family of Jesminder are of Punjabi background by the way. They come from India in a state called Punjab. They happen to be Sikhs, and follow Sikhism as a religion. There happens to be a large community of Sikhs living in the United Kingdom, especially in the city of London or West London. That's where Jesminder is from. I feel this is important to know since you get a good idea what this movie is about. You even get to see David Beckham towards the end. Bend it like Beckham is a fun movie for the family to see. It's a family movie, and the family will like it.",Bend It Like Beckham

I love teh way that Gurinder Chadha portrays Indian family life in such an entertaining way, I loved another of her movies, Bhaji on the beach, which was even funnier than this, but Bend it like Beckham is a great story, brilliantly told and wonderfully acted by everyone.
Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys Meyers were all good in the lead roles, but I thought that Anupam Kher was brilliant as the father.

58,richieandsam,Not very impressed.,4,18 April 2013,"BEND IT LIKE BECKHAMFirst of all I just have to say that I did not see this movie all the way through, so this review is only for what I saw.I did watch most of it I missed the first 20 minutes of the film, but watched the rest.It was pants!I didn't like the look of it before and after watching most of it I can say that I was right with my original instinct.The movie is about an Indian girl who just loves football and wants to play the game professionally but her parents are dead against it.So she decides to go behind their backs and plays anyway.The movie stars Keira Knightly, Parminder Nagra & Jonathan Rhys Meyers.I was very disappointed with the acting in this movie. Keira was OK but it was definitely not her best role. Thankfully she got better after this film.Jonathan Rhys Meyers was the worst actor in the whole movie he really stank up the place. His performance just felt so un-natural. He looked like he was reading his lines off of a dummy card all the way though the movie.It is a shame really, because I loved From Paris With Love he did a great job in that, so I know he can act.The definite high note about this film was Parminder Nagra she was convincing in her role. She is a very good actress.I suppose another reason I didn't think this film was any good is because I am not a football fan. Don't misunderstand me I never let the subject matter decide if I like a film or not. I don't like ballet, but think Black Swan is an amazing film.There were a couple of bits in this film that made me laugh though. It is a typical British film. And there were some very normal lines in the movie, but when they were said in the London accents made them funny.I liked that about the film.I remember when this film was originally released it was very popular. I don't know why. Maybe it is because here in the UK, most of the population loves Football. But maybe I am wrong.My girlfriend really liked this film she gave it 7/8 out of 10. I was shocked but we sometimes do have different tastes in movies.I will give this film 4 out of 10.Not good and I will not be going out of my way to watch the first 20 minutes.If you disagree or think it deserves better feel free to message me and tell me your opinions. :)For more of my reviews please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Bend It Like Beckham

And this also is a bit the plot of the story, it's the story of an Indian girl who is a talented female footballplayer who has two handicaps : she's a girl (football is a man's sport) and she is coming from a culture in where football is seeing as complete waste of time.

65,jb_campo,Cute teenage angst story with cultural twist,6,31 March 2014,"I finally watched this movie over the weekend and it was pretty much what I expected, hence my OK rating of 6/10. The film portrays Jess, a teenage Panjab Indian living in London, who has special skills playing soccer. However, her family wants her to go to school, get a husband, get a job, have kids, and be bored the rest of her life. Jess will have none of it. The story goes on a predictable trail where she is discovered, gets to play on a girl's team, wins her father's heart, wins the final game on a penalty kick, and goes off to America on a soccer scholarship. Very neat and clean movie, but not much substance.There were several problems with this film. It could have been a lot shorter. Most of the soccer scenes could really have been cut down. The dancing at the wedding could have really been cut. The silly, puzzling story line of potential lesbianism should have seen the editing floor up close and personal, right next to the stupid homosexual scene with her best friend. For these, I blame the director. He tried to add some substance to a movie that really barely could handle what it had.The one bright spot was the exceptional acting of Jess's father. He was rock solid, believable, as was the other girl's father. But the two mothers, especially the English one, Juliet Stevenson, was way over the top. Again - fault of the director. Lastly, the coach, Joe, was OK, but really, come on, you know you're not supposed to fraternize with your female team, and you break the rules big time. If I was his boss, I'd have fired his butt on the spot.So, ignore all that nonsense, plus the unnecessary story lines, and you have a nice little teenage angst story with the Indian cultural twist to add some spice.

This is something else I saw in school, as an example of different cultures meshing and conflicting in R.E lessons, and that's probably the best thing about it. It is a pretty good and interesting take on culture conflict and how women ""aren't supposed"" to play football, but it is cheesy. Sweet lord almighty is it the cinematic equivalent of a big chunk of brie.I was entertained throughout it, but it is really predictable, not especially well directed, and there is some horrendous acting and dialogue here and there. The main performances are all pretty good though, and while it is cheesy as anything, the characters are at least likable and understandable, but that's the main problem; it feels so unbelievably uninspired for the most part, and if it weren't for the fact that it touches on gender and race issues in sport, it would be absolutely nothing.Even as it is, it never goes much deeper than acknowledging the fact that it's much more difficult for a woman to play football professionally than it is for a man, or that someone born into two different cultures can have a hard time dealing with it, so while it's more of a unique take than a typical sports drama, it doesn't really do all that much with it in the end.At worst it's still entertaining enough though, and ""get your lesbian feet out of my shoes"" almost makes the whole film worth it on its own.",Bend It Like Beckham

This time of year I generally don't see many movies because this is that time that the tweens and teens are ""king"" in the movie makers eyes...most movies due to be released in the next 2 or 3 months are blockbuster shoot-em-up special effects (yaaaaaaaaaaaawnnn..) type films that do absolutely nothing for me.

72,blakiepeterson,A Winning Coming-Of-Age Film,8,18 May 2015,"Formula can work in several ways, but two seem to be predominant in our sentimental cinema system. One formula, perhaps found in a manipulative Katherine Heigl vehicle, travels down a bumpy path until it crashes into a nearby ditch. The dialogue, never witty to begin with, is littered with the clichés of the past. The plot, robotic in its determination to take a detour into Tinsel Town, causes an eye-roll instead of a deservedly smitten sigh. But then, there's the formula found in a Gene Kelly musical. We quickly figure out how everything is going to end (he'll get the girl! Come out on top! Defeat the ""villain""!), but its ability to exude agreeable comedy and make the most of its befitting stars turns predictability into an art form. We want him to get the girl, to come out on top, to defeat his nemesis. Formula can work wonders, as long as it's done right.""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a formulaic coming-of-age dramedy, but never did I feel manipulated to smile, to laugh, to do anything pertaining to unbridled amusement. Years down the road, I may not remember the inner workings of its plot; what I will remember, though, is how much elation I felt during its quick 112 minutes. So lucrative is its formula that I turned into one of those middle-aged monsters who finds themselves unembarrassed to talk to the screen, begging the characters to make the right decisions.A radiant Parminder Nagra portrays Jesminder Bhamra, a British teenager of Indian descent. Though her family resides in London, still strong is their attachment to their strict culture. A picture of their maker hangs above the fireplace, judging every move; the mother (Shaheen Khan), conservative and close-minded, doesn't much care about education, preferring that her daughters learn how to cook a proper Indian meal and feed it to their (future) nice, Indian husband. But Jess feels trapped. She's a high school senior, bright, and completely in love with -- GASP -- soccer. While the other teenage girls in her culture have accepted their upcoming marital dilemma, Jess wants something more. She wants to receive a good education, to become the female David Beckham. Fearing the wrath of her domineering parents, she attends soccer practice under the guise that she's headed to a demanding job. Jess becomes close to a fellow teammate, Juliette (Keira Knightley), and soon develops a crush on her young coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Before, her biggest concern was to avoid getting caught by her parents. Now, she not only has to worry about punishment; she also has to deal with the fact that Juliette fancies Joe too.On paper, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" sounds, expectedly, like tepid formula. But with its irrepressibly wonderful cast and knack for natural comedy, it's a notable success that gives us an excuse to abandon our problems and find escape in someone else's. It's a warm film, perhaps doped up with copious amounts of anti-depressant medication.The best thing about ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is Nagra, an appealing actress that gives Jess an immediately charismatic air. So often are we told to like the teen at the center of a coming-of-age movie; unusually, Nagra makes it easy for us to root for Jess. Delightfully supporting her are a spry, witty Knightley, a hilariously shrill Shaheen Khan, and Juliet Stevenson, who portrays Juliette's mother with extroverted comedic skill.It's rare to laugh out loud during a film, and ""Bend It Like Beckham"" provides plenty of gut- busters. Not because of a well-timed punchline, not because of a physical comedy mess -- because human interaction is funny, because clashing cultures can be funny. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a winner.",Bend It Like Beckham
73,iwatcheverything,A Delightful Film,7,10 October 2003,I thought this was a very good film.  It was funny yet had some dramatic points.  To see some of the different cultures interact was also great. Being American I still did not understand all of it but I did not need to completely understand to get what was going on.The movie did not focus on the game as much as I thought but more on the family conflict.  I think that this film was one of my favorites of late. It was light hearted and funny and that was what I was what I was looking for.  People should go and see this movie as soon as they can.,Bend It Like Beckham

Why this got all the hoopla and praise it got is beyond me.  It's yet another coming of age movie, but this time its an Indian family and soccer's involved.  The movie just drags on at points...how many times did we need to see the main character defy her parents and sneak out to play soccer?  We get the point! Grow some balls, stand up to them already and end this!  The lesbian references/jokes got tired really quickly.  The movie on a whole was just annoying.

75,ryan_kuhn,Soccer Can Be Entertaining,7,13 February 2005,"To ""Bend It Like Beckham"" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to ""Hit it Like Bonds"" or ""Dunk it Like Jordan."" Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham does, much like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does in the film Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.",Bend It Like Beckham
76,Benjamin_Cox,Shoots and scores - 80%,8,20 January 2007,"Eight? Eight for a predictable sports-based movie where the lead overcomes every obstacle thrown at her and triumphs at the end just like every other sports-based movie? Have I gone mad? Well, no actually because although ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is as original as a boy-band cover version, it is still a surprisingly enjoyable film which somehow manages to avoid becoming another chick-flick cliché. A solid cast add to the mix but while there are plenty of goals, there are still one or two holes at the back which threaten the side. Incidentally, whenever I talk about football, I refer to soccer in case any US readers get confused.Parminder ""ER"" Nagra plays Jess, a rebellious daughter in a strict Indian family living in London. Obsessed with football star David Beckham and possessing more skills on the pitch than she realises, she is spotted by another female footballer Jules (a very young-looking Keira Knightly) who persuades her to try out for a local football team, the Hounslow Harriers. Keeping her place in the side a secret from her family, she struggles with the gaping chasm in culture as well as her feeling for her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). As her sister's wedding day approaches and the resentment from his disapproving parents (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan) grows, can she develop her skills further and secure her dream of playing professionally in the US?Like I said, there is nothing shocking and surprising about the screenplay which manages to throw in every conceivable barrier for our hero to overcome. And despite the creaking plot, the story is enlivened by quality performances throughout. Nagra and Knightley are fantastic but Meyers lets the side down a bit. There is also a surprising amount of humour which is genuinely amusing, particularly from Knightley's mother (Juliet Stevenson) who worries excessively that her daughter is a closet lesbian. The clash of cultures does offer a unique perspective as far as sports movies go but it isn't much to offer the casual movie fan.But that's the thing with sports movies - no matter how impossible victory looks or how many obstacles you put in front of the hero, you still watch them to see the hero overcome it all and bask in the glory they richly deserve. You already know how the movie will end but that doesn't stop you enjoying it - a philosophy that surely led to Sylvester Stallone making ""Rocky Balboa"" recently. The fact that the hero in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a cute Indian girl instead of a sixty-year-old meat head means that this is not your typical sports movie. Instead of guts and sweat, it has heart and brains and it's that which gives this film its rating. See, I haven't gone mad...",Bend It Like Beckham
77,thefan-2,Lovely film,10,4 August 2015,"David Beckham is a British soccer star and the husband of Victoria Beckham (""Posh Spice"" of the Spice Girls). His trademark is a goal shot that curves across the pitch and into the net. The soccer equivalent of an unhittable curve ball in baseball. ""Bend it like Beckham"" means making that type of spectacular shot. Apart from that, and a little shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux-cameo at the very end, the movie has nothing to do with him.The movie is full of little soccer in-jokes, such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it (property of the great Mia Hamm, to those in the know), references to ""Posh 'n' Becks,"" the video homage to the WUSA one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend (""They *have* that??""), lesbian gags, sports-bra gags, and so on.The story is about a teenage girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a soccer star. She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their fascination with our WUSA), and her parents, who are set in very old-fashioned ways that do not allow daughters, among other things, to engage in contact sports. The girl's family are portrayed with great affection -- think My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to conceal her growing soccer stardom from them.",Bend It Like Beckham

Her parents are sure her athleticism will scare away prospective suitors so they prevent her from playing with a local team that's trying to recruit her.  Eventually, the father recognizes she must pursue her dreams so relents and lets her play.Parminder Nagra plays Jess, the young footballer.  Don't feel guilty if you were knocked out by her beauty as much as I was - she was in her mid-twenties when this film was made.  The cast was adequate as far as acting skills are concerned.  This wasn't meant to be an art film, just simple entertainment.  The plot is pretty basic and it's handled well by the cast and director.

80,Jexxon,Shoots... and scores!,6,24 January 2005,"Perfectly OK comedy/drama about two girls playing soccer despite less than inspiring parents. One of them comes from an Indian family that wants her to choose a more traditional lifestyle, which causes problems.This isn't really my favourite kind of film, but it still managed to be entertaining. There's not exactly anything new plot-wise, but it's done without taking itself too seriously, so it still works. The acting is fine all-round, but I think that Nagra shines and manages to be very believable despite being quite a bit older than her character.One thing puzzles me, though - why are the male leads/hunks in this kind of films always so damn boring? I'm sure that many women find Rhys-Meyers good looking and all, but he's got the charisma of a dish rag. Strange...Anyway, not much else to say about the film: looks good (although the actual soccer footage leaves a lot to be desired), and the music was adequately catchy.

81,jazzest,Far Advanced Women's Sports Film,9,16 June 2003,"As a women's sports film, which is not very common at this point, Bend It Like Beckham is a far advanced mutant. It deals with a lot of materials--immigrant issue, interracial romance, generation conflict, and gay/lesbian issue--and interweaves them into one compelling story. Soccer scenes look real thanks to skillful cinematography and editing. The counterpoint of an Indian traditional marriage ceremony and a soccer game is one of the most impressive climaxes on celluloid ever seen. Acting could be better as well as the characters' emotional struggles could be explored deeper. Still, the film is unique and well-done enough to be a landmark in film history.",Bend It Like Beckham
82,David_Brown,Excellent Film,10,22 August 2012,"I really like this movie, and the women are beautiful. There is a lot involved when it comes to ""Bend It Like Beckham"", but one of the key themes in this movie is about breaking through a glass ceiling, which in this case, is the British class system, where you were born in a certain class, and you remain there. When you first meet, Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), you see her playing soccer in the park with the boys and being better then them. She is noticed by Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), who says she should try out for the girls soccer team who was coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who Jules had a crush on, but became the love of Jess's life). Neither girl was particularly happy. Primarily because of their mother's. Jules had the worst one (Juliet Stevenson) who felt she was a lesbian (Incorrectly), but Jess's was no bargain either (She had daydreams of her ruining her playing soccer). The soccer team would be their chance to escape from their lives. Jules really hated her life and would do anything to escape it (Soccer was a means to the end (Which is getting away from her mother and moving far away)). Jess was different, she cannot be like her sister Pinky (Archie Panjabi) who will be satisfied with living a traditional East Indian wife life. Instead, she knows she has a gift for soccer that came from God, and, does not want to choose between her family and soccer, she wants both, and is tired of sneaking behind their backs to play. As she said: (Spoilers) "" I'm not lying any more. I played in the final today, and we won if I can't tell you what I want now, then I'll never be happy, whatever I do."" Earlier, her father (Anupam Kher), let her leave her sister's wedding, to go play in the final (He saw how miserable she was). In the end, her father who is a traditional Sikh, very stern but loving, is the one who realizes he has to let her follow her dream, and go play soccer. Note: Because of their ability to play soccer, Jess and Jules are both offered the opportunity of a lifetime which is a chance to get an all expenses paid, College Scholarship at Santa Clara in the USA. He said: "" I don't want Jessy to suffer, I don't want her to make the same mistakes that her father made, of accepting life, accepting situations, I've seen her play; she is brilliant. I don't think anybody has the right of stopping her, I want her to fight, and I want her to win."" Note: He played Cricket when he first came to England and because of discrimination, he stopped playing, and as he pointed out ""Who suffered? I did."" The final scene of the movie (Without Jess) involving her father and Joe playing Cricket, strongly suggests that he has accepted the decisions that she has made (Including dating a non-Indian in Joe), and she will have broken through her glass ceiling, and got everything that she wants and deserves in life, and will be coming back home. Note: Jess even says to Joe at the airport: ""I will be back at Christmas, and we can tell my parent's then (About us)."" Jules also got what she wanted, and you hope she will find happiness in America. It is a great film. 10/10 stars.",Bend It Like Beckham
83,clydestuff,"Predictable but charming film, well written, well acted, beautifully directed",8,5 October 2003,"A while back when this film first began it's run at the cinemas, it seemed I was bombarded with ads for it on the internet whereever I went.  I found it quite irritating after a while.  Fortunately, being the fair minded individual that I am, I didn't let the ads deter me from viewing what turned out to be a pleasant little film.  Not perfect, mind you, but enjoyable on many levels.This is a film about a beautiful young girl, Jesminder (Parminder K. Nagra) raised in a strict Sikh culture, who loves and honors her parents, but yet desires nothing more than to utilize her talents playing soccer.  When Juliette (Keira Knightly) sees her playing soccer with the guys in the park one afternoon, she invites Jess to try out for the team coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Having considerable talent on the field, Jess makes the team, and quickly becomes best friends with Juliette.  The problems arise because Jess's parents (Anupam Kher & Shaheen Khan)want only for their daughter to learn how to cook and marry a Sikh, preferably someone of their choosing.  So, in order to continue playing soccer, Jess must continually lie to her parents and sneak out to the soccer field though she isn't happy about having to be deceitful.  To make matters worse, Jess begins to develop a crush on Joe, whom is also loved by Juliette.  Add to this a sub plot about Jess's sister (Archie Panjabi) becoming engaged, unengaged, then engaged again, and the plot is teeming with complications.The film is somewhat predictable, reminding you at times of films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but everyone in it is engaging and believable. Directed and partially written by Gurinder Chadha, her characters are funny, sweet, and entertaining, without being overly broad or played too much for laughs.  I do believe she could have edited the film by about ten minutes, as there are too many scenes of how Jess sneaks out to play soccer that become repetitious but that's nitpicking more than anything.Parminder K. Nagra is beautiful and endearing in her role as Jess.  We see the love she has for her parents, but also her love for the game of soccer. She is torn between honoring her parents and disobeying them to fulfill her desire to play.  When Jess's love for Joe begins to appear, it is easily one of the most sincerest sweet romances I've seen written in a while, and Nagra plays it to perfection.  Kher and Khan do so well playing the parents, that in a funny sort of way, though we may disagree with their strictness, we wish for Jess to be able to honor them also.  In too many films of this type, the parents can become more caricature than characters, so a big applause goes to the actors and Chadha for keeping things on track. Keira Knightly is equally as good as Jess's friend and her love for the game also causes a clash with her Mother, Paula (Juliet Stevenson), who believes her daughter should be out finding a man instead of wasting her female assets on the soccer field.  Some of the funniest scenes in this film are between Knightly and Stevenson and are guaranteed to give you a few chuckles.I really enjoyed watching this film.  Sure a lot of it is predictable, but when a director and her cast are as good as this, how can you go wrong? If you can spare roughly 105 minutes out of your day, take the time to watch this endearing charmer.  You'll be glad you did.",Bend It Like Beckham

85,joshuafagan-64214,Interesting and Modern,8,19 July 2016,"In a fair world, this wouldn't have had to be an indie movie. When I think about indie movies that got popular, I think about films like Juno, quirky and unusual films that came out at just the right time to strike a deep, fundamental chord with a mainstream audience. This film is not like that. It's a simple, straightforward story of two girls who love to play soccer.Then again, it is fortunate that this is an indie movie. Mainstream execs would have ruined this film. They are good at one thing: selling films to as big an audience as possible. That is not a crime, and saying it is their job, I have a hard time condemning them for doing it. But mainstream appeal comes at a cost: the soul of the film. Now I'm not saying big blockbusters cannot have a soul, but trying to convert a smaller film into a big blockbuster can drain it of what made it special in the first place.This film certainly is special. It's not spectacular- this is no MMFR or Godfather or Princess Mononoke- but it lifts itself above and beyond its genre contemporaries. The craft is excellent, from the cinematography to the use of music, and the writing is surprisingly spot-on.It is also impressively earnest. Many films of this genre have that studio sheen and professional smugness to them, as if they know they are exploiting their viewers for profit's sake. The quality of the films suffers for it. Typically, the people who write and direct these films are a generation or two older than their characters. If they care enough to put some effort into the film, this is either undetectable or inoffensive, but if they do not, things can get ugly real fast.This would have posed even more of a problem in this film's case. One of its two main characters is Indian. Studio execs have enough trouble handling foreign cultures in dramatic contexts. In comedic contexts, they are completely lost. This, along with racism and slavish devotion to traditional ideas of money-making, is one of three ways why they stay away from these sorts of movies entirely, and while that is heartbreaking and I'd love to see it change, I can't say it's comforting to see a big studio movie bumbling its way through a culture it does not understand. The end product is usually either bland and boring or, worse, stupid and insensitive.Thankfully, studio execs were not involved, and the filmmakers, who understand exactly what they're doing, handle their topics deftly and smoothly. This is not an esoteric film. You don't need a deep understanding of India, Britain, or Sikhism to like or understand this movie. But the filmmakers' knowledge informs on it heavily. They don't have to reach or shoot blindly into the dark. They know their playbook, they know what they're dealing with.This film is their baby. They put an unusual amount of effort into it. While not every sequence works, there is an air of grandeur and passion to the all thing. This is not to be confused with an air of pretension: this very much is a romantic comedy through and through. The filmmakers simply care about fleshing out their story and characters, making the experience interesting and thoughtful instead of half-baked and slapped together.The relationship between the two girls is stellar. Friendships are not often done well in films, but the playful, affirming chemistry between them is just great. While it does fall into clichés and contrivances, including a limp love triangle, its energy and fluidity and strength more than makes up for that. The way most hacks write friendships, it's a wonder they had friends at all- maybe they didn't. This film gets its two main characters and the relationships between them.If there is a villain in this film, it is binding, restrictive beliefs. The cultures these beliefs erupt from are not bad, but the beliefs themselves are, particularly when they stand in the way of dreams and hopes. More than soccer, this is a film about culture and how it defines groups of people. Jess' sister wants to have a nice Indian wedding and start a family, and that's fine. Jess wants to go to America and play soccer, and that's also fine. In an era in which so many are scared of losing their culture, this film shows that cultures are at their strongest when they interact with other cultures, swapping ideas and thoughts, helping everyone get the lives they want and strive for.",Bend It Like Beckham

We got to see that it doesn't matter what country you are from, there are still prominent issues that can really bring or divide a family. Joe was a fantastic part to the development of Jess and Jule's friendship, and I thought the idea of Jess and Joe was adorable.

87,miken-3,Great,8,20 January 2005,"I caught this movie while flipping through the cable channels and was instantly mesmerized. It is about a teenage Indian girl (nicknamed Jesse) in London who loves soccer and hopes to play for the British woman's team. The problem is her family still believes that women are married early and have many kids and do not delve into distractions like games. Therefore, Jesse must sneak away to attend practices. She develops a friendship with one of her teammates and generally loves the new world she has entered.Meanwhile Jesse's sister has had her engagement arranged. Jesse gets in big trouble when she hugs her teammate in a bus stop and the parents of the groom happen by in car. They see Jesse's teammate from the back and think that it is an ""English boy."" They go to Jesse's parents and want to call the wedding off because a proper Indian woman would never do something like that. Jesse is forced to tell her parents that she is playing soccer and that the ""boy"" was really her teammate and nothing happened between them. Her parents tell her to stop this soccer business and prepare herself to be a proper Indian wife. Her father tells her that he was once prevented from playing cricket because he is Indian, so he has vowed to never let sports become an important part of his life.Jesse has to sneak away to attend a big game in Germany. There things get rocky between herself and her teammate because they are both competing for the affections of their coach. He seems to favor Jesse because he has had similar problems with his own parents who think it is unmanly to coach women's soccer. Of course the game is so big that the team's picture is put in the newspaper and Jesse's parents find out. Jesse must decide if she will do what her parents want or follow the ways of her own heart.The Indian culture is well presented with lots of colorful costumes and jubilant celebrations. Also, there is a lot of well placed comic relief such as the painting of an Indian wise man that everyone seems to talk to for advice and Jesse's teammate's parents think that they are having a love affair because their daughter hugs Jesse and is very athletic and likes to wear pants.All in all, a movie that when it ends you want it to never stop!",Bend It Like Beckham
88,de_niro_2001,Excellent,10,8 February 2008,"If you want to see a film about footballing females, forget Gregory's Girl this film is far better. It's a feel good film about contemporary people and is in the same league as Brassed Off, The Full Monty and Billy Elliot. Like these films, had it been made in the 1970s or early 80s it would probably have been made for the small screen as part of BBC's Play for Today and it would not have been as upbeat. It is socially relevant as it shows the tensions that can arise between young Asians in Britain and their conservative minded parents. The opening fantasy sequence which shows Jess's mother being interviewed by Gary Lineker and him saying she must be very proud of her daughter and then she tells him in no uncertain terms of her disapproval of her daughter playing football is very good. The performances all round are great. Keira Knightley was still a rising star when this was made. It's funny the way there is a misunderstanding which leads to Jules' mother's unjustified fears of her daughter being a lesbian are seemingly confirmed. Keira has a slightly boyish appearance which is an asset when it comes to infiltrating pirate ships but leads to another misunderstanding when Jess's sister's fiancé's parents see her and Jess having a matey hug and kiss. Juliet Stevenson gives a great performance as Jules's mother who definitely has a little bit of Hyancinth Bucket in her. Look at the way she dresses for the football match as if she's going to Royal Ascot. Despite various setbacks all ends satisfactorily. The closing shot is very good showing Jess's father playing cricket after he has mentioned a couple of times in the film how he had to leave a cricket club years before because of racism. I am a bit of an aircraft buff and watching the film I was surprised to see that the team were coming off a Boeing 707, an airliner that has been obsolete for a good many years now. The trivia section here confirmed that it was indeed a 707. But that doesn't detract from a great movie, one of the best British films of the early 21st Century.",Bend It Like Beckham

94,segacs,I loved this movie!,8,5 February 2005,"I saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it! Bend it like Beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl. This is Parminder Nagra (""ER"")'s breakout role, playing Jess, a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (that's soccer to us North Americans). And even though she's actually much older than her character, she plays the role pitch-perfect.This is a movie about friendship - specifically Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate who is also going through family issues, especially with her mom, who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. They also, unfortunately, both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes some strain in their friendship.In some spots, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clichés. In others, scenes drag on far too long, and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing.But this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up, culture clash, and the love of football. It's about female empowerment, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is the little film that could... and did.Excellent. 8/10.",Bend It Like Beckham

It's proof how popular this movie is. The title has been used time and time again. Bent it like....what does that mean. People learned after this.Really cute and yet powerhouse movie at the same time. It's one of those rare gems that you find and are excited about! This movie discusses culture clash, racism, sexism, general women's issues, family issues, relationships, sexual orientation, and more. And it managed to do it with out being preachy, keeping a fun tone, and not going overboard.THIS is a movie. If only more film makers would take notes. You don't need a blasting song in EVERY scene to make your point. The silence speaks volumes in some scenes when the actors just stand there and look at each other with a meaningful intensity. Acting/casting/writing/direction/wardrobes were all fantastic. I would describe this movie as a girl that just wants to follow her dreams and falls in love along the way. Inspirational movie that is a must see imo.",Bend It Like Beckham

The first I saw this I really knew nothing about soccer or Indian culture, and had no idea who Keira Knightley was. And while this a good primer for all that (wasn't this her first film?), I think it's an on-point coming-of-age film, with a superb father-daughter moment that every father should relate to.The premise is easy enough to follow, Ms Nagra is terrific, and you'll forgive them for trying to cram every moment with a plot twist - the gay boyfriend, lesbian allusions, etc. It's like having a big house, you don't want anyone to think you weren't clever enough to to fill an empty space with witty dialogue.But they restore your faith with a fun & diverse sountrack (I got to Soundhound a lot), and if you just need to an hour & fifty minutes of binge time, you won't go wrong here. If you happened to enjoy the current ""Ted Lasso"" on AppleTV, then you probably should catch this twenty-year predecessor.",Bend It Like Beckham
98,RJBose,My Big Fat Sikh Wedding,9,23 May 2003,"There are many similarities between ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" in that both deal with the collision between ethnic groups and the assimilation of immigrants' children into the society into which they have relocated themselves.  The story and humor of ""Bend It"" are quite superior, however, to the contrived, and often cheap laughs of ""Greek Wedding""; it is the story of a teenage Sikh girl (the people of the Punjab region of Northwest India, known for wearing turbans and beards, and for their very strong work ethic) who is growing up in London, and is caught between the old world view of her immigrant parents, and the realities of modern life in England.   Like ""Monsoon Wedding"", ""Bend It"" offers an interesting glimpse into the world of Indian society and customs.  Like ""About a Boy"" and various other Hugh Grant films, the movie also shows middle class life on the other side of the pond, which is also quite interesting.  This Sikh family lives comfortably in the London suburbs with a father who is apparently an airline pilot.  While the parents live and function as members of English society, they also, understandably, adhere more closely to the customs of their culture than their daughters and others of the next generation who are typical English teenagers, but also lead a double life at home, and within the Indian immigrant community.   The main character of the film, Jasminder (Jas), is interested more in playing soccer than in learning traditional Punjabi cooking technique, and idolizes the famous English soccer player David Beckham (the Shaquille O'Neal and Bobby Bonds of England combined).  When her soccer abilities bring her into membership on a local girls' team, the conflict is set up with her desire to play (and she is quite good) and her parents' desire for her to pursue serious studies at college, and set about finding a proper (Punjabi Sikh) husband- like her sister.   Making the story more poignant is the experience of Jas's father, who as a young immigrant with great promise as a cricket player was cruelly discriminated against by the English cricket clubs he sought to join. Though the movie follows basic formulas that most people will be able to recognize, the setting and details are compelling enough to keep the tale fresh, even if you can predict who will show up to help win the ""big game"".   ""Bend It"" is a very refreshing amalgamation of several motifs; the ""sports movie"", the ""star-crossed lovers"" tale and the ""goofy old-fashioned parents"" genre, to name three, but yet surmounts each of these potentially banal conventions to succeed mightily as an entertaining, interesting, and- dare I say it- inspiring story.

Still, I caught it on television and LOVED IT. It's a heart felt story with great acting, beautiful visuals, and cool soccer scenes. It's not a ""chick flick"" either - my fiance loved the story despite all his groaning before he saw it. Of course there is even something very sensual in the soccer scenes or when the girls are working out. The only thing that detracted for me was the bit of contrived romance and the British accents are VERY thick.

104,obiwan2005,Nothing quite like 'Beckham',10,4 May 2003,"I walked into the movie, knowing full well of the international acclaim this movie has received. And had no doubts I would enjoy it. Enjoy it, I did. The film is about an Indian girl named 'Jess' played by Parminder K. Nagra, who is very partial to Soccer and plays it very well. She also idolizes the Soccer (football in the movie) star David Beckham. She meets a beautiful tom-boy beanpole named 'Jules' played by the lovely Keira Knightly. She gets her to join the Football team and falls for the coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). But her parents frown upon her football playing, and think it is silly. So she spends the rest of the film breaking away from her parents and reaching her full potential as a football star. This film is the definition of 'feel good movie of the year'. And uses a plot unlike anything we have seen before. You end up rooting for Jess, and end up laughing at her family, to whom which were very comical. I recommend this movie very highly. Especially as a date movie. I can't wait to see the stars of this movie in other movies. I liked them all very much. Although, after all was said and done, I still don't know what 'Bend it' means.RATING:**** out of ****",Bend It Like Beckham
105,Teebs2,"Sorry to be a party-pooper, but....",5,9 July 2004,"This film was so dull! Before I start, I must say I genuinely wanted to like this film. It is always nice when a smaller British film achieves some level of success worldwide as, let's face it, it's a rare occurrence in recent times.However, this film was decidedly average in every way. To begin with, I watched this on video and that's exactly where this film belongs. There was very little in the look of this film that gave any idea that this was a theatrically released film. Everything about the film screamed TV FEATURE. Aesthetically the cinematography was totally flat and bland, the music was a mix of irritating Brit-pop and slightly better contemporary Asian music. I watched this pan and scan and was surprised that it was originally widescreen, the width didn't seem to have been used - again all very TV.Storywise, it was a pretty stock rags to (possible) riches story. It was interesting to see women's football in the spotlight, particularly concerning an Asian girl. The culture clash aspects were well handled, but at a fairly superficial level. Much of the comedy seemed weak compared to the sharper BBC series ""Goodness Gracious Me"", although there were a few good moments such as Juliet Stevenson's gaudy mum digging herself ever deeper with racial stereotypes and an old Indian lady who mistakes ""lesbian"" for ""Lebanese"". The script and acting were OK for TV-drama fodder but were weak for a theatrical feature. This film certainly doesn't give any indication for Keira Knightley's sudden rise to stardom. Yes she's a good looking girl in a bony, supermodel kind of way but her acting didn't convince me in this film. I also have to add that for a film about football, the actual football scenes were very weak and badly edited. Some action scenes with a bit more excitement and flair would have helped the film.I could continue, but I really can't be bothered. I'm glad it did well for the sake of the British film industry, but I'm also a bit embarrassed. For someone like myself who loves film and cinema I would say avoid the hype and give this film a miss. If you like your TV dramas and soap operas you may well thoroughly enjoy it. My verdict: 5",Bend It Like Beckham
106,taikman,A very enjoyable night out if you don't want to see anything deep,7,28 August 2002,"'m not sure exactly why I'm going to give 'Bend It Like Beckham' such a good rating. There are many other movies which I have given 7 to which are technically much better (in terms of acting, script, sound, look), such as 'Minority Report' or 'Blue Velvet'. But well, 'Beckham' is just so damn likeable.The story is about Jess (Parminder Nagra), an English girl of Indian descent who idolises David Beckham and loves to play soccer. However her traditionalist parents frown on their daughter running around getting muddy and showing everyone her legs, and want Jess to be like her older sister, who is about to get married. So Jess secretly joins a womens team that her friend Jules (Keira Knightly, who is absolutely gorgious) plays for. Many of the best laughs in the film come from Jule's ditsy Mum, who also frowns on her daughter doing some so unfeminine as playing football. Not only is there trouble with both girls parents, they both fancy their coach Joe (the equally gorgious Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).'Beckham' is a lot like 'Monsoon Wedding' in that it features one of those wonderfully colourful Indian weddings and highlights the sometimes uneasy meeting of Indian and Western cultures, though it does not have the richness of style and emotion that that film does. I'll get my criticisms out of the way first: some of the camera work is dizzying, there are a couple of moments when it gets a bit mushy and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performance is not always convincing. But it almost seems mean to be hard on this movie - it is a simple, straightforward and funny story, the kind of enjoyable, low-budget comedy-drama like 'The Full Monty' or 'Brassed Off' that the British do very well. It is nothing amazing but nor does it try to be. At the end of it you come out feeling good. And it is hard to argue with that.7/10",Bend It Like Beckham

The basic message is one of empowerment and acceptance. The ""football"" scenes are uncommonly well handled and the racial and sexual issues are dealt with in a deft fashion.

110,evilasahobby,Feel good movie with a cultural twist,7,7 July 2002,"Bend It Like Beckham (BILB) isn't an original movie by any stretch of the imagination. The ""talented individual held back by family concerns"" tale has been well used by writers, as is the ""coming of age"" story that usually accompanies such a tale. Despite this lack of originality, BILB still manages to hit all its marks with some great performances from its cast, and is worth seeing as a popcorn film.The use of Continental Indian culture in England as the backdrop of the film was interesting, with some of the film's funniest scenes coming from the playful mocking of this culture. At points it does seem to skate into the it's-funny-because-they're-different territory, but this is kept to a minimum. For those who dislike soccer (or sport in general) there's no need to worry - BILB keeps the technicalities of soccer to a minimum and the matches are all shown in highight format. Those who live soccer as a religion may be irked by the match footage (the girls are moving well under full pace and all goals come from point blank range) but this is a small gripe. All of the cast put in solid performances, with Parminder K. Nagra (Jess) impressively able to carry weight of the film's focus.Every now and then the film does slip into looking and feeling like a british television show rather than a movie, but this isn't a huge problem. My major snipe at the film was the ending - I'm not a big ""feel good"" movie fan and the saccharine final minutes did have me squirming in my chair. But this is a small point; overall BILB is well worth spending a couple of hours with for a dose of light entertainment.",Bend It Like Beckham

112,Imnozy,A thoroughly charming movie,8,21 March 2004,"It is often difficult enough for young people to overcome preconceptions on what they should do, what they should wear etc. When the preconceptions are those of a Sikh family living in Britain - and the teenager is a girl who wants to play football, there is no easy way for both sides to see the others' point of view.The problem is treated with humour and compassion in this delightful comedy, well cast and equally well acted - showing the immense difference in ideas between a family steeped in tradition and those of a daughter, brought up in a country where girls are able to do pretty much what they like.  Then again there is a native British family where the mother's ideas of what a daughter should be doing (clothes, boys, makeup) clash considerably with her daughter's wish to excel at what is considered fine for a boy - and strange for a girl.Although the stereotypes are somewhat overdone, the movie as a whole is entertaining - with the problems solved pretty much to everyone's satisfaction.

114,eh5963-297-967354,An Entertainer all they way!,8,25 April 2012,"Gurinder Chadda's Bend It Like Beckham is more about culture and stereotypes than anything else. It is surely not a film about Soccer or Sports. So don't expect a Remember The Titans or Coach Carter or Chak De India here. Having said that, I will add that it is still an entertaining, witty and brilliant piece of work. What looks like a sports film from the outside actually deals with many different South Asian stereotypes and Issues that NRI's deal with. Arranged marriage, homosexuality, racism are some to name a few.Jasminder Bhamra is a young, naive teen who loves nothing more than soccer (Football to most, sorry I'm American) She is a smart girl and great in school. Jas gets offered to play in the bigger leagues but there's one simple problem - She's Indian! By the end of the movie, there are moments you take home with you. Mostly hilarious moments and some serious ones. Jas' struggle initially to play is well executed. Not to forget the scene when Tittu's parents come to Jas' house to break Pinky's marriage. Of Course the wedding scenes are funny. I also loved the whole Punjabi flavor of the movie, but that may be because I'm Punjabi.Flaws? Of Course! The film does drag at times in the second half. Also, some of the whole soccer moments seem uninteresting. I also felt there was some minor lack of chemistry between Parminder Nagra and Johnathan Meyers.The writing for the most part is great. I loved the one-liners in the movie. The movie guy in the end telling the Indian bride to look sad. ""Indian bride never smiles, you'll ruin the bloody video,"" And also the one liners by the ladies in the end when Jas is accused of being a lesbian. ""Lesbian? Her birthday's in march, I thought she was a Pisces,"" and ""Lebanese? No, she's Punjabi"" I was laughing hard at some of those lines. Especially the one's delivered by Jas' mom.The music is awesome. Although the songs are not original, they are placed right and work well.Gurinder Chadda's direction is excellent. I do not find her a great director but I feel she really hit the bulls eye with this one. Unlike most of her other work.Every performance is noteworthy. Parminder Nagra suits the role to the T. She's just a fine talent in this one. Another actress that stands out is Shaheen Khan as the crazy Punjabi mother. She's just phenomenal. Kiara Knightly does well. Ditto for Johnathon Meyers. The supporting cast is good too.However, the person who stole the show for me is a great Indian actor named Anupam Kher. He's just outstanding as the caring, sweet and concerned father. One really feels for the man by the end. Anyone who knows Anupam's work will agree with me on how versatile this man truly is. A delight to watch!

116,SteakSalad_101,Another fantastic Indie from Fox Searchlight,7,23 December 2006,"God, how I love Indies. They're funny, unique, usually somewhat dramatic like a dramedy, and special in their own way. Which is why I simply love Fox Searchlight studios: they've created movies that drop from indie heaven, and they are a fine studio. Bend it Like Beckham is in no way any exception: it's funny, smart, dramatic, special, and gives you that feel-good feeling inside. Parminder Nagra, an actress I have never seen act anywhere else, plays the Indian teenager Jess living in England with a passion for football (for us Americans, soccer). Her parents say otherwise, though, and she ends up lying and cheating out of her culture just so she can follow her dreams of one day playing professional. Her idol in life is David Beckham, much to her parents disprove. Almost in every way this girl is a rebel, and that's partly why the movie is so great. She will stop at nothing to make sure her dream is realized. Now, why, you ask, is a movie about that so appealing? Well, that's a question you'll need to see it to properly understand the answer to. The movie delivers a powerful, almost controversial message: your dreams are the most important things in your life. Put nothing ahead of them, and follow them until they come true in every way you originally imagined them to. This is a good movie to watch along with the recent film ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" as they both deliver the same message, and are both produced by Fox Searchlight, simply the BEST in indie film producing today.

117,ProperCharlie,The best British women's football film since Gregory's Girl,4,19 April 2002,"** MINOR SPOILERS **This film is like that epitome of 70's cuisine Angel Delight.  It's got slightly cheesy packaging that promises a wholesome and uplifting experience.  What you get is something that leaves you grinning but also with a nasty chemical aftertaste, an intangible emptiness and the feeling that the government has just tested a new happy drug on you to quell your rebellious spirit.The heroine, Jess is a 'typical' Hounslow dwelling girl with a gift for the nutmeg and the dribble, who dreams of big things and scoring for United and David Beckham.  Unfortunately her parents see her as a) a lawyer and b) married with kids.  Many set pieces ensue with Jess hiding her footballing activities in order to avoid confronting her parents over her future. Ultimately, of course, the big show down has to happen and does during her sister's wedding.Let's just say it's not all that surprising.  A quicker summary would be to say Gregory's Girl as performed in the style of Goodness Gracious Me (UK sketch show, not Peter Sellers).   And that's it, there's nothing more. Intangible emptiness.  Big grin.  Has someone slipped me something?  This popcorn tastes funny.OK you could go on about the stereotypes.  But then British film and British comedy are big on stereotypes.  In some cases they're justified and funny and in some cases they're clumsy and so unfunny you feel the need to complain to someone about them.  For every Danny the Dealer and Camp Freddy there's a cockney gangster #2 or a blue-rinse matriarch.  Bend it Like Beckham's are just about OK, but I did feel they're walking very close to the edge of tackiness and tastelessness.I would add that I work in the College that most of Southall's youth attend when they're doing their A-levels and the portrayal of the girls shopping and the boys playing football is *spot* on.  These people really exist...I don't doubt the director's motives for making this film, but I do question the studio's morals in marketing it.  The Bollywood film market is the UK is huge and getting bigger by the day.  The World Cup is round the corner. David Beckham is Hello magazine's number one dreamboat.  So what better than a lot of zeitgeisty stuff crammed into 90 odd minutes of celluloid and marketed in a surprisingly big way.  Don't forget this film premiered at the 1500 seat Odeon in Leicester Square.  What could be a strong feminist statement of a film, what could be the first 100% mainstream 100% British-Asian film with a really big studio push is just an average Brit-com coining it in for the shareholders.  It's a Mike Leigh film with most of the social commentary replaced by poor jokes and an injection of mass-produced optimism.  I feel that I've been promised something then been let down badly.  Intangible emptiness, mindless grin, feel-good but real-bad.So, go if you must, but don't eat the popcorn.  I'm going back to my Billy Bragg records.",Bend It Like Beckham
118,Jenny Ho,Another British hit!,8,16 April 2002,"Jess is an Indian girl whose dream is to become a professional football player like her idol David Beckham.  However, her traditional parents want her to do well in her A-Levels so that she can become a lawyer.  Jules (Keira Knightley), a member of the local ladies football team spots Jess playing in the park one day and is so impressed by Jess's natural talent that she persuades her to try out for the team.  On joining, Jess helps the team reach the finals but is unable to tell her parents because they are so strict.  Her dream of becoming a professional player is in jeopardy when the date of her sister's wedding is set on the same day as the final match. Where this story tugs the emotions is the realisation that Jess wants her parents to be proud of her and she wants to demonstrate her respect by doing what they want but in doing so, she is risking her future happiness by sacrificing an opportunity of a lifetime.  Here is a heroine worth rooting for.  The supporting cast is also good:  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the team's coach smoulders sex appeal and Keira Knightley reminds me of a taller and younger Winona Ryder.  Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Jules mother who fears her tomboy daughter is a lesbian.  Also look out for dubious cameo appearances by Posh and Becks towards the end of the film. References to Indian tradition and culture during the film are a little bewildering and some of the audience may find it difficult to relate to the restrictions imposed by family and tradition that the younger generation seem to be faced with.  Nevertheless, there is a good deal of laugh out loud moments and some of the scenes do have a 'Goodness Gracious Me' feel about them. The ending is predictable.  The release of a British film is often accompanied by comparisons with recent successes such as 'The Full Monty', 'East is East' (personally I thought these two films were overrated) and 'Billy Elliot'.  I feel the closest comparison would be with the latter in this film's ability to combine the right balance of pathos and humour. 'Bend It like Beckham' deserves to be a hit.",Bend It Like Beckham

Hounslow's a good place to start,10,15 January 2006,"Gurinda Chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle, poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London.Like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with David Beckham.Much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds.Somewhere in the middle, as broker, peacemaker and blighted athlete, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team coach for the Hounslow Harriers - intercedes in times of crisis, while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters.Eventually, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way, we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams.With great performances from Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr Paxton) this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers.Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are struggling their own struggles, but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film.In it's own special way, this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football.

Bend it Like Beckham was one of these trailers, and I have to say, it didn't entice me to see it, but my darling sister decided that she wanted to, so off to the video store we went. The plot is this - Jess, a girl who is very good with a football, is discovered by Jules, a tomboy who cares only for her football and nothing else, except maybe Joe, the coach of the team that she plays on, and wants Jess to join.  It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Jess but she has two small problems - ONE: Her sister is getting married soon, and her family and her need to pay attention to the wedding etc. etc, and TWO: said family is a strict Indian family. Jules also has the problem that her mother wants her to be the demure girl who cares about nothing but how they look or who their latest snog was.The fact that I was fairly apathetic about it just added to the delight I felt when I was watching it.It's a great movie, one of those that you walk away from feeling light and refreshed, like ""Amelie"" or ""Playing By Heart"".It's got its own quirky humour, that mainly shows itself through Jess's family dealing with her unorthodox hobby, but the highlight of the movie is Jules' mother, expertly played by Juliet Stevenson who also made me laugh as Mrs. Elton in ""Emma"".If you haven't seen it, no matter what you feel about football (or soccer, whatever term you prefer) see this movie sometime soon. If you have, get it again, it has definitely got rewatchable value going for it.In summary - good family movie, see A.S.A.P.    9/10",Bend It Like Beckham

Gurinder Chadha effectively hides the typical 'struggle against culture' under layers of charm, wit and an interweaved storyline.

130,manalone923,"Nothing original, and pretty predictable",5,5 March 2004,"Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I can get pretty long-winded at times, but this will probably be my shortest commentary so far.  Bend it Like Beckham is not a bad movie. It's acceptably acted, moderately entertaining, and there isn't any one thing that stands out about it as being terrible. But that's my problem with it; it's just average. I gave it a rating of 5, meaning that it isn't bad, but it isn't particularly good either. I found it, simply, average.  The film tells the story of a young Indian girl who idolizes soccer star Beckham of the title, and wants to pursue the sport which she's good at. Unfortunately she's bucking the wishes of her traditional, humble family who want no disappointment or ill to come to their daughter. Complicating things is an unnecessary possible love triangle that is flirted with between the main character, her soccer friend, and the coach, and that's pretty much the whole film.  I guess I was just disappointed. I kept hearing how great this was, and how unique. I didn't find it unique at all. The movie focused somewhat evenly on her soccer hopes and her family life, but it's the soccer that gets the most glamorized treatment. The family provides mostly cultural jokes and deep discussions of how the daughter isn't upholding their traditions, etc. When the coach offers the young hopeful his support, everyone thinks that they're dating and we have a whole new twenty minutes of complications. And near the end, when a talent scout is discussed, the main character is desperate to get his attention and prove her worth. I hope I'm not spoiling anything, but I'm going to continue and say that nothing happened that I didn't expect.  In closing, Bend It isn't a terrible film. However, I didn't really laugh at any of the cultural stuff because I knew that was the main point of it even being in the movie. And I wasn't moved by any sweetness, because anyone could guess that it was coming. The movie sort of dragged on to me like a kind of shallower Karate Kid, but with laughs at the cultural differences instead of the interesting blend of them that I believe Karate Kid achieved. I know that the main message here was to follow your dreams, but I left thinking the movie was just a glamorized soccer film, with the cultural stuff just put in there to keep it from being nothing but.",Bend It Like Beckham

132,mikestollov,Light & Dark surround this soccer story,8,5 February 2004,"Plenty have said a lot about this film, covering most of the themes. However something that doesn't get mentioned is the racism.Sure Jess's dad, Mr Bhamra, was the victim of white cricket players when he first arrived in the UK, to the extent that his talent was wasted. But look a little deepr & you'll see a whole new, unmentioned, level of racism revealed.Mrs Bharma makes comments about Muslims that would be unaceptable if a white person made them. It's not as if it's a ""foreign"" muslim, i.e., non Asian, even Indian muslims are considered base & beyond the pale. Also spot the reference to white people as ""Ghuras"". This reminds me of a Chinese person who once, in a drunken state, told me that they refered to white people as ""boiled chicken"". Now then, how much trouble would I get in to if I called a black person a ""Spade"" or ""Darky""? There is a perception amongst everyone that racism has a white face, a racist slur to begin with & simply not true. Whether the film makers intnetionally showed this matter up is still a question however.Beyond that the story is a little soppy, but not too over the top. Let's be honest, this is about girls so it's already straying in to areas of emotional minefields. Note how Jess gets in to trouble with her friend over the coach. First of all Jules told Jess she regarded Joe (the coach) as a brother & Jess never kissed Joe. Yet Jules blasts Jess regardless of what actually happened. For once I'm glad to see a female character suffering the same trouble when dealing with female ""logic"" that men have to deal with all the time!The footage on the field is, of course, massaged to make them look good, although Jess & Jules can obviously play. Is this a fair criticism when Arnold Schartzneger has the same techniques applied to his films? (note the Terminator 2 scene where Arnie pulls a gun from a bartender. The speed of movement was due to editors pulling every 3rd frame out of the film strip, NOT his fast reflexes!) The film's visuals do lack a decent polish, but since it was filmed on a tight budget this can easily be forgiven.It's a fairy tale after all, perhaps with all the films that portray what's right as the bad guy getting poetic justice at the end of some tired buddy movie, we forget that some times a little magic & good news can be on show too.As an attempt to describe the unravelling of steroetypes & attitudes within modern UK society it serves it's purpose well. It's fun to watch, without being gripping. The characters are a little cliched, especially Joe, but it shines a light into Sikh society as the next generation pulls away from their parents & picks & chooses the elements of Sikh & UK culture that they feel comfortable with.There are some true comic moments, the cell phone ringing at the wedding for one & the things Mrs Bharma sees as she wanders around trying to find her daughter for anotehr. So much for upright morals!",Bend It Like Beckham
133,john-ruffle,"Yes, but where was Beckham?",8,24 July 2006,"My comments about this film are prejudiced, I admit it. Reason? The majority of the location shoots were all around the neighbourhood where I lived as a teenager, and where I still teach teenagers today. This means the film immediately engages me on a personal and non-cinematic level.One of the best British films of recent years, BILB manages to portray not only racial conflict, but also the tension that youth of all races have with traditional customs and parental expectations. With my familiarity of the area, and also its people, I can assure the viewer that on this level, the film works as accurately as a documentary might have, with the advantage that BILB is a whole lot more gripping.In an age of mindless teenage screen fodder, this film is funny, touching and refreshingly reflective. For any audience, the film works - for a teenage audience, however, it deserves a 10/10. I've given it an eight because I'm not a teenager, and I try to make my scores reflect general, cinema-literate audiences.A downside of the film structure is its pacing. It's a little uneven in its plot points, and worse still, I have yet to figure out the purpose or the plotting of the fight over the video camera. I saw it on first theatrical release, and perhaps I'm thick, but it simply made no sense at all even on re-play on video later.But the film's most serious flaw is its casting - or rather, its lack of casting. Simply put, where was Beckham? Although, according to IMDb.com, he was represented by uncredited stock footage, the Beckham of the title simply did a no-show for the movie. An absolutely unforgivable omission, one that deserves my pulling the film rating down a notch. But I'll refrain, since it was almost certainly David Beckham's refusal to co-operate. The very least he could have done would have been a visit to the film shoot, so at least some actuality footage could have been run over the closing titles, instead of the obligatory teen-flick ""goof"" footage. If I could vote for Beckham, he'd get a zero for disappointing an otherwise very good (proud-to-be multi-cultural) British film comedy.",Bend It Like Beckham

Goal of this film is to entertain and to make you feel good, and this is accomplished with no problem. The story is quite simple, about Indian girl struggling to play football against her parent wishes. The biggest assets of this film are the actors. Acting is overall good, especially two central girl characters. Nagra plays girl seven years younger than she should be beautiful, is very cute and you really feel for her when she is in despair. Knightley in her breakthrough role is shiny, girly and very sympathetic and plays her tomboy girl very good (she is also incredibly beautiful, no wonder she pull it through after this). Another notable actors is Stevenson in the role of Keiras mother, especially in the scenes where she find that her daughter is not a lesbian. You can really see her relief, great scene and great acting. Football scenes are quite unrealistic, but I will forgive this because this film is not really about football.

136,Rash,"At last, a believable Asian/English film",8,4 November 2002,"Having seen Bhaji and East is East, I wasn't looking forward to seeing this. The first two films, though very funny, were not true reflections of Indians/Asians in England. For a start they were wholly focussed on s.e.x., black/white boyfriends/girlfriends, unwanted pregnancies, etc, etc for some reason.To my surprise this film was totally different. It concentrated on the dream of an Asian girl wanting to play football against her family's wishes/traditions. This movie could have worked just as well if it was a boy. It was very well filmed (in the middle of summer) and the scenes of Southall/Hounslow made me feel like I was there (I'm not by the way, but I have seen the place(s)).I recommend this film to anyone who dreamed of playing semi-pro or professional football, as well as to anyone who wants to see a good family yarn. The director (Chadda) has provided a good balance of humour and family life without going over the top. The acting overall is to a good standard and only Julia Stevenson goes a little OTT as the neurotic middle class English mother. But this just adds to the humour!A sidenote warning: If witnessing yet another 18 year old Asian wearing a Vodafone shirt makes you sick (as it does me) then I suggest you hide behind the sofa for the opening moments of the film. After that, thankfully, she only wears the Hounslow Harriet outfit and this makes for much more comfortable and pleasant viewing.",Bend It Like Beckham

Maybe because the previews I saw made me think this film would be funny.  It had some cute dialogue but generally this was a generic plot.  Foreign films usually have a certain panache.  They are different from American films sometimes in big ways and sometimes in small ways.  This film looked and acted like a mediocre American film.  Every American issue was highlighted in this movie: gayness, sports vs femininity, generational differences, tradition vs change, race vs race (although I thought sociologists have already proven there is no such thing as race), stupid mothers and wise fathers... I think the director watched a thousand mediocre American films, compared plot lines, found the most popular plot line, and developed a film with the purpose of gathering an uneducated American audience and thus making money.

The soulless terraced houses of Hounslow (ever a familiar sight to this Brunel alumni) or the acknowledgment that (shock, horror) ethnic minorities live in Britain are a stark but welcome contrast to white-washed bogus like Notting Hill or Bridget Jones's Diary.It would be interesting to see what Chadha will do with a more adventurous genre, because stylistically she's certainly more Lucas than Loach (and that's a compliment).",Bend It Like Beckham

Parminder Nagra's performance as Jess Bamra was a brilliant way to make her famous on TV and screen. The way she loved football behind her parent's back seemed humorous at the beginning though it nearly cost her relation with her family.

Yes, the Greeks also intensely hope that their children will marry other Greeks, but they do not go as far as actually arranging -or unarranging- marriages against their children wishes. Outside of a slap-stick scenario, such a situation, like child abuse or wife beating, can never be funny or amusing.  While the 3 or 4 young actors do a very creditable job, the same cannot be said of the rest of the performing and production crew. One cliché leads to another. Few scenes are truly humorous.

145,fepp,Lovely comedy about football & cultural conflict,8,3 November 2002,"Similar in some ways to Swedish movie ""Jalla, Jalla"", this movie deals with the collision between ""traditional"" values in an immigrant family (girls are to get married, life before marriage is preparation for marriage) and the opportunities present to girls in contemporary western society (soccer is a nice way to get scholarships and a wish to be free). The tone of the movie is quite light in the face of what in many other movies is portrayed as a tragedy.  Which is very suitable and makes this movie a nice evening's entertainment, while still illustrating some important and interesting points about culture clash. The Sikh family of main character 1, Jesminder, is not the only problem. Main character 2, Juliette, also has an interesting family with an overprotective/worried mother who wants her to be more like a true girl (and thus like herself when she was young).  And main character 3, Joe, claims that being Irish is a bit like being a Sikh.

146,dgoody,Uninspired lower division fare,5,13 April 2002,"Bend It Like Beckham is a film that attempts to deal with adolescent angst, arranged marriages, racism, disfigurement, self-belief, homosexuality, parental disagreements, trust, idolisation, jealously, class divides, female bonding, cultural breakdown and the coming of age. However it merely succeeds in being a cliched romantic comedy which wastes interesting ideas like a striker with Tolblerone for boots.Jess is an 18-year old whose elder sister is getting married and whose parents want her to be doing likewise as soon as possible. However she is far more interested in playing football like her idol David Beckham (who can bend a ball well, as we are reminded no less  than 10 times in the movie!) than learning how to cook Aloo Chat and become the perfect wife. Against her parents wishes she joins a local girls football team and numerous plot contrivances (and there is no other fitting way to describe them) lead to misery for all involved until the cop-out climax.Gurinder Chadra's film is not without it's redeeming features. The performances are solid and likeable with only Juliet Stevenson's image obsessed housewife seeming a little too much like it was fashioned from the back of a corn flakes packet for comfort. Jess's adolescent dreaming and view of life are also neatly captured at points, especially in the opening sequence where she fantasies about scoring the winner for Man United and having pundits heaping praise upon her, only for her Mother to invade her daydream and chastise Gary Lineker and company for encouraging her.Unfortunately such light hearted playfulness is rare in what is a depressing sombre film, with writer-director-producer Chadra either unable to produce consistent comedy or deciding that there are more worthy causes to focus on. However there are simply too many ideas and too little depth given to the deeper issues of the film, with Jess trying to balance both English and Indian cultures and her and her parents hopes, and after a while you wonder if the film was adapted from the contents page of a book on the trials of being an Indian teenager.The films plot, which seems like it has the words `and then...' written in capital letters every five pages of the screen play, seems to rejoice in coincidence. No sooner does one situation start developing, such as the token relationship between Jess and her coach, than the viewer is thrown a twist that lands half the protagonists in a cliff-hanger. This approach would be understandable if the film were being shown as ten minute segments on TV with the Hollyoaks theme being regularly played, but appears woefully childish on the big screen.Lacking the emotional resonance of films such as East Is East, Bend it Like Beckham is an opportunistic piece of cinema that cashes in on a big star name who doesn't even appear, almost in the style of Bowfinger. I spent most of the time wondering who the player who kept getting dropped whenever Jess could play was, and how she felt about her disposable nature. She could be seen briefly at one point, but like most interesting things in the film, disappeared within seconds.5/10David Goody",Bend It Like Beckham

It's definitely a 'feel-good' movie and you're pretty sure after the opening scene exactly how things are going to turn out, but the journey to the foreseen conclusion is pretty fun.A lot has been made of the Sikh angle, but I think a lot of people miss the sly parallel woven throughout the story.The movie focuses on Jes, a talented soccer player, younger daughter of a mostly traditional Sikh family living in England. Throughout the movie, she wrestles with her respect for her culture that opposes her hunger for soccer. Her parents don't think it proper for her to devote energy to a game when she should be focused on education, a proper relationship, eventual marriage and motherhood. Of course, many Western viewers will think, ""Hey, that's stupid, she's almost an adult, she can do what she wants, the parents are living in the past!""Which is why those viewers miss the parallel in her Anglo friend Jules' story. She, too, has a talent for soccer...and is defying her mother's expectations and notions of 'proper' behavior and goals for a young Anglo girl.That parallel is what elevates ""Bend It Like Beckham"" from hundreds of other movies of the same formula. It's not an 'English' movie or a 'Sikh' movie or an 'Indian' movie...it's a movie about growing up and finding your own identity. A coming of age film, if you will. With a little thought and reflection, you realize this movie does more to destroy stereotypes and thumb a nose at racism than other, more 'serious' movies.Cultures and ethnicity may change, but growing up remains the same. And if you can bend it like Beckham, you've got a nice solid foundation to do the growing on.",Bend It Like Beckham
149,clemtine,Immerse yourself in some culture; this is a delight to watch.,8,29 May 2008,"A healthy mixture of culture, social issues, friendship, romantic love, and passion for sports. This movie has it all. Jess is Indian and her parents are counting on her to be the family's next solicitor but she has a passion for football and her parents won't allow her to follow her dreams. This movie uses football as a device to discuss some concerns in society like racism and a bit of sexism but apart from that, it is also used to carry that undying message of chasing your ambitions to gain happiness. Parminder Nagra is a delight to watch on screen alongside Keira Knightley. This movie is unexpectedly marvelous; you won't ever regret seeing it. From British director Gurinder Chadha, this is a charming uncomplicated story told in a rather realistic way. It is funny, fulfilling, and absolutely fantastic.

In this case, the story centers around Jess(Parminder Nagra), an Indian girl living in England who dreams of playing soccer professionally. Her parents however, won't have it, wanting her to marry an Indian boy and learn how to cook. Really no surprises in the plot, this movie is average in every way. The one thing that raises my rating to a six is the well-filmed soccer scenes and a few funny moments.

Paminder Nagra stars as teenager soccer whiz Jesminder whose parents are keen for her to hang up her football cleats, find a nice boyfriend, and learn to cook the perfect chapatti.  Enter Kiera Knightley - the scrawniest footballer in history - who enlists Jes to play in a local women's league, much to the horror of her parents, especially her father, wonderfully played by Anupam Kher. Director Gurinder Chadha and her team of screenwriters keep the pace light and fun, making sure Jesminder's cultural conflict never strays from the boundaries of the comedic realm.  A romantic subplot with Jes's Irish coach, played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, is less successful, and seems to intrude on the message of individuality and self-esteem.Luckily, the pacing of the movie is breezy and fast, and any moments that serve to slow the movie down don't last long.

It is vitally important that EVERYONE feels special. Our current society is one of ""hero worship"", of ""celebrity worship"", of people filling the void in their own lives resulting from unrealized and unfulfilled dreams with the vicarious living through of famous others. This is not healthy.""It is impossible to truly celebrate the success of others, if one cannot truly celebrate their own.""I am happy for the beautiful success of the 2 girls, but, it is difficult to not feel some pangs of jealousy stabbing my soul.

Simple. As a people we have to always encourage one another to be fully ourselves, to always follow ""our"" dreams, and to trust that we are all kind, generous, wonderful human beings, who just want to be happy and make others happy (search your heart. deep down this is true).It's a matter of trust, and faith in each other.Keira Knightley is an impressive actress. I can see the fire in her eyes. It's beautiful.But...I will never truly be able to appreciate it, until I feel that I am fulfilling my own dreams. I don't think anyone can truly appreciate Keira, until they feel they are also on top of the world as she is, enjoying incredible success in their own lives.And...there's no need to fight to get there.

The children of immigrants often have trouble reconciling two cultures. Growing up is tough, but kids and parents can usually get along if they work at it. All these are perfectly sound observations, but they're laid on with such a lack of subtlety that you just want to scream.And scream I did during the exchange between Jess and her coach, when he reminds her that he does understand prejudice as well, because ""I'm Irish"". It's almost as if the writer was just tidying up the final draft, and suddenly realised there was an oppressed minority group that hadn't been included in the mix.This is not the time and the place for a debate about political correctness, because that only leads to platitudes as dull as those in the film.

I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America. Enough about me. Truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven. What a fun film. It's full of color and exuberance. I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can't help but root for her. No wonder why the American television show E.R. has snatched her up. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. Those people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the film!) I'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in American films as well. This is a perfect date film.

It was billed as a teenage coming of age' film'liberating', inspiring' uplifting' etc. I was extremely letdown. The performances are mediocre, at best. Lies and deception win out over traditional family and cultural values. The central character herself (Jess) is not even likeable. She is raised by her parents with loving but strict, core family/cultural values yet ultimately succumbs to drinking, club-dancing, sneaking out behind her parents backs, lying, and deceiving both her parents and her best friend. Is this really what coming of age' is about? Is this was truly will bring happiness? Is this virtuous? The film's mantra that parents don't always know what's best for you, that you have to live your own life', etc., is repeated so often that it becomes tiresome, and overwhelms any positive appreciation for core-family values and the traditional values revered by the central character's culture and many cultures throughout the world. Jess finally winds up stealing the young man who her VERY best friend is in love with in a romantic twist that is lacking credibility. And, all this after begging her best friend and college roommate-to be for forgiveness. In short, the 'heroine' has lost all her virtuous traditional family values.  I'm at a loss as to why this film was so popular except that some may find 'liberation' from traditional values a 'good thing'.

Seems like the Indian people really hyped it up for seeing such a venture for the first time. But even I, an American, can see the obvious - that the director has pretty much sold out her culture and homeland for a monetary profit. Thats right. This movie is filled with stereotypes and clichés about Indian immigrants in Britain. Thats how it goes forward, by purely exploiting and amplifying embarrassing stereotypes about Indians. If I were an Indian, I would have disowned this movie and the director.Not only that but this movie also depicts some Britishers as totally ignorant of other cultures.

There were moments of universal mirth as everyone got the joke and certain other times when only pockets of the audience understood.  Despite this at the end of the film, it was telling that few people rushed off, with most of us waiting to see the hilarious credits roll to completion.I am one of the people who missed out on ""Bhaji on the Beach"" but I will be certainly checking this out on video now.Very Good. 8 out of 10.",Bend It Like Beckham

178,Groovey,A deceptively light story encouraging rejection of family values,4,31 March 2004,"Bend It Like Beckham is a fun and touching exploration of a girl's desires to excel in the face of immense cultural opposition.  Along the way, it has a lot to say about stereotypes. While I found the story somewhat interesting although very predictable, I kept waiting for the underlying values to come through all the opposition. It finally dawned on me that the rejection of everything traditional *was* the underlying value. Religious and cultural mores are by definition wrong; follow your heart and ignore any consequences.  It seems to work great for the protagonist here; how well would it work for a young man who doesn't have the strong family Jess has, who is struggling with a drug addiction and thinking about robbing a liquor store for the much-needed cash?  Maybe the moral here is not as lofty as it seems.There is a mix of a lot of different things thrown together in this film, such as tying multiple different prejudices to family traditions, showing that girls are really better than boys, and indicating through the displayed family attitudes that any moral objections to anything are rooted in immorality -- a nicely circular argument.One very good note in this is when Jess finally refuses to lie to her parents any more.  She is making an existential stand and decides to do what she believes is right.  That her decision to do so is completely apart from respect for family values, though, is clear enough.I can see why so many young women like this movie.

182,jaxeed,An interesting and amusing approach to cultural conflict.,4,27 September 2005,"When I sat down to watch this film I actually expected quite a bit, as the plot takes on quite complex issues. Using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach. Still unfortunately, despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between Muslim and western culture, adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays/lesbians, it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film. This leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle, attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.However, this does not mean that the film is directly bad, as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing. The film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter, but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep. This has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts. By this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.Even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama, the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when ""the ball drops"". This way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy-ending. Nothing is left out in the Hollywood like ending. So even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages, one can't help but roll eyes towards the resolution. Personally I was close to shouting ""finish already!!"" at the screen.There were some decent acting in the film, and the two young female central characters had some good moments. So did their parents and other bi-characters. However the handsome Irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting, that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism. He didn't even appear very likable, but rather self involved despite his good deeds, which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.I give the film a 4, as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from. The script and cast had many good believable characters, giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others. Had the let-downs not been this disappointing, I'd easily give the film a 7 or 8. If you enjoyed this film, I'd recommend the film ""East is East"", which I think is an as good, if not better rendering of cultural conflict, as well as being amusing and engaging.",Bend It Like Beckham
183,RenoPeters,Good performances save this trite story placed in the Indian community of London.,5,10 November 2003,"This story would never have made it into a widely distributed film except for the fact that the main character is a young Indian lady in contemporary London. The performances of the three youths make the film enjoyable to watch but the story is totally predictable and the direction mediocre if not annoying.  There are too many filler scenes with pop song backgrounds that add nothing to the plot.  The final scenes of the wedding party are particularly obnoxious and I believe insulting to the Indian culture.  The final shots during the credits played to the awful song ""Hot, Hot, Hot"" might be the lowpoint of any of the films that I have seen this year. Perhaps I have been on too many cruises where that song is overplayed night after night.Saying all that, Parminder Nagra is a delight to watch and her performance lifts the movie above the banality of its plot.  I hope to see more of her in future roles, hopefully with better scripts and direction.If this movie is at all similar to ""My Fat Greek Wedding"", I am very glad that I did not see it.My rating is 5.5 stars but Imdb only allows me to vote 5 or 6.

184,eb_redbaron,really great fun,10,8 August 2002,"for a non-english viewer, this indian-british comedy is a true delight. the story is teenage-highschool, but dealt with in a much more earnest and embarrassing (in an endearing manner) way than most american counterparts. also, the parents of the two girls have a lot of screentime and are more fleshed out characters than usual. the central story of girl-friendship combined with sport is unusual in itself, but because of it, the film has all the energy and drive of a sports movie, with winning and losing moments. the love triangle is a little weak in my opinion, since both girls´ main interest seems to be the sport. still, its always great to see the hugely talented jonathan rhys meyers appear on the big screen, so its just too bad, its such a small and almost unnecessary role!i truly enjoyed the film with its youthful energy and hilarious family situations. there is a lot of the ""goodness, gracious me"" humor in it, but thats always rather a good thing, i find.",Bend It Like Beckham

And a huge part of that charm came from the fact that it didn't try to 'say' anything....there was no message other than the story itself...The upbeat story just keeps moving right along in a riot of colour, family conflict, and cultural demands. Of course the story can be viewed as being formulaic. What girl meets boy story doesn't use the same situational hooks?

187,Garp23,Just give in & enjoy it!,8,29 January 2004,"Is there any more worn-out genre than that of the sports film? With the exception of Ron Shelton films (`Bull Durham', `White Men Can't Jump', `Tin Cup'), the only decent one on the last decade was Spike Lee's `He Got Game', which dealt more with father-son relationships than actual sporting events (I'm not counting the wonderful `Kingpin' as a sports film here). Either we get bland and dull kiddie fare like `The Mighty Ducks' and `Air Bud', or we get unimaginative grown-up fare like the noisy `Any Given Sunday' and the sappy `The Legend of Bagger Vance'. `Bend It Like Beckham' is not only another sports film, but it's one made in Britain, set in the world of football (in America, British football is known as the never very mainstream game of professional soccer), and references in the title an English athlete most Americans have never heard of (David Beckham, the Michael Jordan of British football, who is married to former Posh Spice Victoria Beckham). What a wonderful surprise, then, this movie winds up being such a treat for all ages, a sports film that looks beyond the big game to the relationships of those playing it.Jess (Parminder K. Nagra) is a teen girl of the strict Sikh faith who loves playing football. Of course it is forbidden by her family, so when she is spotted in a park by Jules (Keira Knightley), who plays for the local girls' team, an invitation to try out is both alluring and forbidden. Jess makes the team, becomes friends with Jules, develops a crush on her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), and spends the summer hiding her passion from her family as she prepares for college and her sister's wedding.None of this is new or unique on paper, but the film keeps finding new ways to present the material. The uneasy relationship between the Punjabi and Caucasian communities in Britian is one new idea, and the fact that Jess and Jules are such distinctive, well-drawn characters helps as well. As Jess fights with her dad (Anupam Kher) to be able just to play, Jules has to subvert her mother's (Juliet Stevenson) belief that female athletes must be lesbians. This is a borderline-offensive concept played a little too broadly, but it does result in a wonderful payoff near the end of the film.Jess' continuous lies and battles to play her game lends the film its drama, as does the dueling crushes Jess and Jules have for their coach, who would be fired if he fooled around with one of his players. By disobeying her parents and playing, Jess is violating scared tenets her faith is built around, and the fact that she might throw so much away over a game gives the film true and powerful tension. Her parents are not drawn as caricatures, like Jules' folks (her father loves the idea of her playing football if it keeps her out of trouble with boys), and their real outrage over her behavior and fear for her future gives the film power. They could never allow her to play, really, a concept fraught with sadness but resolved realistically.The film plays like a fairy tale, complete with a storybook ending that some may decry as false and sappy. But this film and these girls earn that ending, and only a crank who has forgotten their own youth could not only not smile at the final scenes, but also not want to see them happen. Nagra is a revelation here, a stunningly beautiful girl who seems so shy and unhappy but just shines when kicking the ball. Knightley, a doppleganger for Natalie Portman, is also beautiful and wonderful in her role; these two girls play off of each other and the script in a way I have not seen for a long time. Kher is also a joy as Jess' father, taking a character that could have been shallow and giving him more depth than can be imagined. Director Gurinder Chadra, working from a script he co-wrote with Paul Mayeda Berges, is a veteran filmmaker making his first big splash in America, and he makes every last moment of this film a treasure.This film, despite receiving a PG-13 rating that seems entirely inappropriate (nothing here warrants more than a PG), is being marketed towards young girls. Don't be fooled: this is a film for everyone, regardless of age or gender. I barely know Manchester United from the Chicago Fire or Pele from Mia Hamm, but I know great movies. `Bend It Like Beckham' is a blast of fresh air, a film so filled with joy that you cannot resist its charms.",Bend It Like Beckham
188,djhenebury-1,The story in short,8,24 December 2005,"A young Indian girl (Jess) simply loves football. She plays football in the park all day long. One day a blonde girl (jules) comes along and says she's been watching her play. She invites her to come to a training of the local lady's team. A few days later Jess has her first training. The coach (Joe) immediately sees that Jess has great potential of becoming a professional football player in the future. Jess trains every week. However her parents do not know this until one day she is forced to tell them. Jess' mother disagrees on her daughter being part of a football team and says she has to learn how to cook Indian meals, so as to prepare for being a good housewife, like all the other Indian girls do. Her father concurs. Jess misses two trainings because she has to learn how to cook. Joe wonders why she's been missing and decides to drop by Jess' house to talk to see what's going on. He tries to make them see that Jess has great potential, but Jess' parents just won't listen. Her father says that in his home country he was a professional cricket player but when he came to England and wanted to join the local cricket team, he got laughed at. Even though her parents tell her not to, Jess continues to sneak out to train with the other girls. One day her sister betrays her and says she's been playing football ever since her parents told her to stop. Her parents make sure Jess doesn't go to training anymore by watching her all day long. One day Jules comes along and tells her the team is going to Germany for a three-day tournament and that there will be some American scouts looking for talent. Immediately Jess starts brainstorming on ways she could tell her parents she really wants to go to Germany. In the end she lies saying she's going to stay with one of her aunts. She calls her mother, from the hotel, each day. But then when her father tries to call them, he finds out that she is not staying with her aunt and he knows that she must be playing football somewhere. Meanwhile the girls are doing great in Germany. After one of the matches Joe goes to Jess for a talk and they end up kissing each other. Jules sees this and is very disappointed in both Jess and Joe. She fancied Joe from the beginning and Jess knew this. The girls are both very angry with each other. When the team returns at the football club Jess' family is waiting for her there. They don't say a word but everybody knows what's going on. Jess' father beckons her to come. At home the daily life continues, Jess has to learn how to be a proper housewife. One day her sisters pronounces she's going to get married on the 19th. Everyone is happy except for Jess. The league final is on the 19th! Even though Joe comes around a second time to convince her parents to let her play, because this time there will be sponsors and they'll be there to watch Jules and Jess play, cause they think they've seen some talent in Germany, Jess her father and mother just say no and that's all. Jess knows this time it won't be possible to sneak away or tell a fancy lie and therefore she accepts the situation. During the wedding party she walks around with a long face, which her father notices. When she goes to the toilet her cousin runs to her and grabs her arm. He says that this is her chance, he could drive her to the field and she could play in the second half of the match. She says she won't do this, she wants to stop sneaking out and wants to stop telling lies; she even says she thinks her sisters wedding is more important than football. Then her father comes to her and says she should go and play, he says that the team needs her and he knows this because he's been to one of her matches without his wife knowing this! Jess and her cousin drive away instantly and Jess changes in the car on the way. When she arrives the team is one down and they have half an hour left to play. She comes in as a substitute and after 15 minutes passes very neatly to Jules and she scores. Then in the last minute of the match Jess is fouled and she gets a free kick. 16 meters, a wall of six, one chance. She focuses and then bends it into the upper left corner with a fantastic kick. After the match Jules and Jess are both very excited and decide to forget about the argument. Jess goes back to her sisters wedding hastily. A few days later she hears that she and Jules can both get an American scholarship and join in an American college football team. She doesn't know how to tell her parents about this. This time she decides to tell the truth. She tells them about the scholarship in and says that it's her dream come true. Still her mother says she won't allow it and looks towards her husband. He stands up, looks at his wife and then at his daughter and he starts a speech saying: ""I once got the opportunity to be a great cricket player, but I turned it down because of our cultures principals and I haven't been myself ever since. I don't want this to happen to my daughter as well. I just want both of my daughters to be happy."" And finally his wife agrees. A week or so later they say goodbye to everyone, including Joe. And then Jules and Jess both leave for America.I give this movie an eight, because I like the story and because some parts are just so hilarious.",Bend It Like Beckham
189,essent,compared to Greek Wedding...,8,2 June 2003,"I think it would be hard to see this movie and not compare it with My Big Fat Greek Wedding (assuming you've seen it).  I don't think this one is a knock-off, it stands quite well on its own.  Furthermore, there are some key elements that give it more appeal to the younger crowd.  There are some typical, but fun twists, cute misunderstandings that you'd expect in any comedy, and it has a Brittish setting which automatically makes it feel more arty.  It's one of those movies that feels formulaic, but you don't care, you just go with it.  I don't really care too much for sports, but it was a fine way to explore some of the themes of the film - which were mostly to do with contrasts in culture, generation, and gender.

She tackled the issues of ethnicity, gender roles, football, and coming-of-age in a 90-minute movie.  This is also where the problem starts, however.With only 90 minutes to boot, Chandha only caressed each of the four heavy-hitting topics.  The issues were shallow, and the jokes were consequently very pragmatic and repetitive.  They were funny because the audience already knew the punch-line and they knew when to laugh.The characters, aside from Jesminder (her performance is excellent in this film), are one-dimensional and stereotypical.  (A suburban mother concerned with her daughter's femininity, a gay ""best friend"", and a Prince Charming who fancies ""dark"" meat ... pla-eese).The bottom line:  How many clichés can you cram in a 90-minute movie?

Sure, there were charming moments, like the Babaji thing and many other Indian-vs-British things, Jules' mother was hilarious, and Parminder Nagra was acting convincingly, but that was it.The story was utterly predictable and ALWAYS followed the clichés. That isn't always a problem if the rest of the movie is charming enough, which I thought it would be, but it wasn't. Despite the good acting of some people, among which Parminder Nagra who I already mentioned, Anupam Kher, Ameet Chana and Juliet Stevenson, the acting skills of others were making me wonder how they could make a living as actors. Oh well, I suppose Keira Knightly has her looks and she shows off plenty of body parts to make the male audience drool (if they like near-anorectic girls). I gave her another chance with this movie after being impressed with the absence of any acting skills in Pirates, but this movie showed I was right in my judgment. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' acting was as natural as banana bubblegum. He must have read his lines off some board! He would have fitted perfectly in 'Days of our Lives' the way he was overacting every feeling and gesture.Anyway, this could have been an okay movie had the acting been better and had I not had these expectations.

However, I am a woman over the age of 40, and I am sick and tired of women being portrayed as empty-headed creatures with no life outside of cooking and planning for their daughters' weddings.  Even a movie like Monsoon Wedding, which portrayed a traditional Indian wedding, had warmth and feeling for its female characters. But I got the impression that the director and writer hated older women.  It just so happens that many, many Indian women have devoted their lives to medicine, government, science, literature, social work.  Where were these women in this movie?Besides those particularly insulting stereotypes, there is the flatness of plot, the fact that the film contained no surprises, and the broad and empty characterizations.  At least the young people were good looking, but not enough to save the film for me.
If I want to see movies about cultures clashes, I'll watch Mississippi Masala, My Beautiful Launderette,  etc.  There isn't even enough football to make the film interesting.Only for people who thought My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a masterpiece instead of a cliches, two-hour situation comedy.

Despite not having any major stars the acting is first class, and it's three young leads - Parminder Nagra, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keira Knightley are immensely appealing. Although the film relies heavily upon its young cast, the storyline is a universal one, that of a youngster seeking their parents approval to do something that they had previously considered unsuitable for their child. The film comes with added elements, throwing in the clash of cultures so prevalent now in Britain. Our heroines are white and Asian, and the acceptance and embracing of each other's cultures is one of the films strongest suits.

Not only did she create a movie that was funny, but she also brought a message to Hollywood: Indians are just as good at making good movies.However, unlike many other film fanatics, I must say I didn't really like this movie. As a Sikh girl, I must say that this movie succeeded in creating even MORE stereotypes about Punjabi families and their values. There are many ignorant people in this world, that have the idea that most Indian families are like the family shown in this film. This isn't true. Yes, Ms.Chadha did address some stereotypes about Indians and proved that they weren't true, but she also helped in creating several others.For example, a couple months ago, a fellow student came up to me and asked me ""So you don't wear shorts because it's against your culture, right?"". Well that kind of annoyed me, because me not wearing shorts had nothing to do with my beliefs or my family. I don't wear shorts because I think they make my thighs look fat. However silly my reason might be, it is a reason altogether. This is just one example of a stereotype that was promoted by ""Bend It Like Beckham"".Gurinder Chadha failed to show that not all Indian families are like the one she depicted in her film. Not all Indian families have village accents, are suspicious of their children's' every moves, place the most regard on their ""status"", etc. She failed in letting the general audience know that, although her film is one with a message, it isn't categorizing Indians as one type: strict and weird.The truth is, that yes there are some families like the one in this movie, but most others are just as ""normal"" as any other family.

210,presence80,A Kickin movie,8,23 June 2003,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  The two main characters are two likable girls that have a passion for something.  The movie is loaded with feminist messages and racial discrimination, and that is the fuel for the conflict in the story.  Girls are looked at with skepticism when it comes to sports and have a tough time proving themselves.  This is true with Jess. She is extremely talented, but still gets clowned at when she plays at the park by a group of idiotic boys.  She doesn't truly realize her talent until she is evaluated by Jules and her coach. The movie touched on issues of discrimination when talking about Jess' father.  When he was younger, he yearned to be a cricket player, but got spat on by the English boys. The performances were all great.  Everybody played their part right on target.  I see many good things in the future for the two lead actresses. The chemistry between the two girls and their love triangle with their coach seems real and un-forced.  Jess as the hero of the story embodies so many virtues.  She is obedient to her family while at the same time showing so much resolve and courage.  Although she lies to her parents and sneaks out, her intentions are out of passion; not of greed or mal-intent. I highly recommend this movie.  It has comedy, drama, and some decent sports action.

211,ragingbull1965,A clash of cultures,10,14 March 2017,"As anyone who was raised by immigrant parents can attest to, this film illustrates the struggles of a second-generation Indo-Briton (Jess) to integrate into the host country and her parents' struggles to raise their children in the traditions of their own culture. I can relate to this because I am a second-generation American born to immigrant parents and I remember very well wanting to fit in with my classmates but having to endure the resistance of my parents who kept reminding me that ""we are different"". This film did an excellent job presenting these cultural differences in the simplest yet most poignant way; with the use of football. Since football is not as popular in India as it is in Britain and in most of the world, it represented one cultural difference. Also, girls playing sports in India is also not encouraged so to have an Indian girl wanting to play a non-traditional Indian sport represented two simultaneous cultural differences. Finally, in many Asian cultures, children are expected to always obey their parents even if that means sacrificing their own ambitions so as not to disappoint their parents. So Jess is forced to make a choice; play football against her parents' wishes or do what her parents want her to do even if this means giving up football. These are just some of the reasons why many immigrants find it hard to assimilate into the dominant culture of the host country. And the consequences are not always amusing.",Bend It Like Beckham

The English is a little too fast, not very clear and easy, but good for learning to understand contemporary British speech.

It's a good movie, esp after students have had enough exposure to westerners to be able to put it in perspective.I found the script on Drew's Scriptorama, so you could prepare some materials to go along with teaching.",Bend It Like Beckham

The film sped along with me never looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the film.  If you liked East is East then you'll love this film.  OK so the storyline is nothing new, and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it's all done very funnily, and with a breath of fresh air.

217,leonardo-24,"Charming, funny and uplifting",9,26 May 2003,"(May contain minor Spoilers)I found this film to be a wonderful alternative to the summer dreg American movie goers are normally bombarded with. The story itself is simple enough: a young English woman, born to Indian parents, dreams of being a football player much like her idol, David Beckham. Unfortunately, her parents would rather she take a more traditional route with her life by getting her university degree and marrying a nice Indian boy. It is this struggle between Jesminder's desire to carve out her own happiness and identity as an athlete, and her parents wish to maintain their culture and values, that make up the movie's core. Jesminder (played by the wonderful Padminder Nagra)is helped along the way by another aspiring footballer Juliette (Keira Knightly) and by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, a terrific performance) a former player, who coaches Jess and Juliette's all female team. As other reviewers have noted, there is never any doubt as to the outcome of the story, but that knowledge never detracts from the sheer pleasure of getting to know these lovely characters.The acting overall was superb. I would be very surprised if Ms. Nagra doesn't become a huge star. She lights up the screen with her sensitive performance and gorgeous face. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is wonderful as Jesminder's romantic interest and football mentor, and what a refreshing change of pace to see a love story between two young adults based on mutual respect and real affection. On a shallow note, Jonathan and Padminder make for one of the most stunningly beautiful on-screen couples I've seen in a very long time. The supporting cast is equally talented, I especially loved Jesminder's parents played by Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan, and her sister Pinky, played by Archie Panjabi. The talented and very funny Juliet Stevenson is a scene stealer as Juliette's slightly overbearing and concerned mother.",Bend It Like Beckham

223,annemaree-99074,A gentle perceptive comedy that stole our hearts in Sydney,9,23 May 2021,"I am genuinely surprised at the low IMBD score and having read some of the low scoring reviews, it seems like people were offended by something, women playing football, stereotypes, etc.This film is a gentle comedy about second generation children of immigrants. Indian Sikh Jasminder's parents have settled in the UK for a better life, only to find one daughter is happy to live a traditional life whilst the other wants to live her life on her terms. I can only assume that this is a personal story for Gurinder Chadha and she gently deals with racism, the painful reality of navigating two cultures, gendered expectations, and even homophobia in the film. The story is not at all preachy and revolves around Jasminder's obsession with football and Beckhammania and falling for a hot Irish coach who understands her because he has his own family and cultural baggage.I am not a football fan and it did not matter for my enjoyment of this film. It is genuinely heartwarming and uplifting and there are not many films I can say that about. There are a few laugh out loud moments as well. The final scenes where Jazz is literally and metaphorically kicking a goal past her beckoning relatives in traditional dress gets me teary every time. I suspect it has spawned dozens of girl-empowerment films but this is the original.Bend it like Beckham deservedly won accolades at the Sydney Film Festival in 2002 and often features on our multicultural broadcaster SBS TV and I have watched it over and over.

It shows the struggles of both an Indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in England at the time.

My perception of Ms. Nagra has only gotten better and I hope to see her in more movies and of course as Neela in ER.I had enjoyed Kiera Knightly in the Pirates of the Caribbean so it was another reason to see Bend it Like Beckham. I thought that both of these actresses did a fantastic job and I hope to see them more often.
Jonathan Rhys Meyers.... WOW! He is hot. When I first saw him I knew I had seen him in another movie, so as soon as the movie was finished I looked him up. He was in The Governess with Minnie Driver and I actually remembered his face. He had only a small roll in that film, but for some reason I remembered his face, and what a gorgeous face it is. He also did a fantastic job.But overall this film was hilarious and I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm not a big sports fan, but soccer is probably my favorite sport because I use to play it, but was never that good. The soundtrack is also awesome.

As a dad I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays (as uncomfortable as I feel with the topic). In a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder (Jess) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer. The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships. In SUMMARY, the soccer scenes are GREAT (lots to learn in slowmo) and while I didn't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going.",Bend It Like Beckham

230,Erynnia,"brilliant entertainment, even though not profound",10,2 November 2002,"Jesminder (Jess) Bhamra [Parminder K. Nagra] is fond of football and quite good at it. Being brought up in a Hindu family, with her parents lacking understanding for her hobby, her sister wondering why Jess should prefer football to boys, obviously does not make life easier for her. Jess sees herself forced to lie to attend the training of a girls' football team she has managed to get into. There she makes friends with Jules [Keira Knightley], a girl who has high aspirations concerning her own (future) football career. Jess finally finds herself in a struggle with her own aims and dreams and the plans her parents have made for her, trying to obey them without giving up her dream of becoming a professional player. On top of it all she has to face a further conflict, since she does not know how to handle the affectionate feelings she has for her Irish trainer [Jonathan Rhys Meyers].The actors did a good job, especially Parminder Nagra. At times you can really sense Jess' despair. I guess this film is not representative of Jonathan Rhys Meyers' actual talent, but his role is too reduced to be played with profound emotion.'Bend it like Beckham' is definitely a film full of energy. It makes you grin and leave the cinema with a feeling of content and happiness.A simple plot? Maybe. Maybe neither unique nor inventive. NEVERTHELESS 'Bend it...' is a brilliant and fresh comedy, a sentimental story about growing up, taking responsibility for your own decisions and living your dreams.

238,shouldased,Entertaining from Start to Finish,8,6 September 2013,"My daughter made me watch Bend it Like Beckham with her several years ago, and I found it to be one I can re-watch. It contains very little of the teenage romance and clothing angst that often fills young adult movies. What it does have is a lot of humanity and heart. This movie is made up of a multitude of small moments of cultural misunderstanding: some cute, some mean, some funny, all of which need to be resolved by Jess and her parents. It does a wonderful job of showing us the contrast between English and Hindu (living in England) middle class home life. It is about following dreams and using talents, within the cultural clash and racial prejudice of middle class suburban London. Set in Houndslow (a suburb near Heathrow airport) Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) is an eighteen-ish girl caught between living in British society and living in a household still grounded in Hindu culture. Father is an airline pilot for (apparently) an Indian airline (he wears a turban in uniform). Jess is an extremely talented footballer (soccer) always running circles around the boys in the pickup matches in the park. She knows her soccer days will soon end with an arranged marriage and her mother's life ahead of her. She is unaware of any alternative, nor of any possible future as a girl soccer player. Enter Jules (Keira Knightley) a star player in a girl's league. She sees Jess beating up on the boys in the park and stops to watch on successive days then approaches her to join their team. Jess is stunned to learn there is such a thing as a girl's league. Jules also tells her there are even girl's pro teams in America. Jess joins her team and through teamwork and selflessness they become a deadly duo in scoring and assisting.Of course, there are problems: Jess has to keep the girl's team a secret from her parents, her mother is constantly demanding of Jess's time to do traditional tasks, her relationship with a white girl is cause for much gossip and malicious rumor within the Hindu community, she must bare her legs in public by wearing shorts, and there is a hint of romance with the coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) that causes a rift between Jess and Jules, conflicts and trust issues with her sister, and Jules's mother begins to think the girls are lesbian. Once her parents learn that she is playing on a team, they stand united that football is at an end and she will get married or go to university and then get married. Jess continues to sneak off and play until the championship game conflicts with her sister's wedding. But with the help of her cousins and her father, she gets away from the reception and plays the second half, returning to the wedding celebration wearing a huge smile that is not lost on her father.Poor father (Anupam Kher). He's the lynch pin of the story. As a young Hindu man in England he had been shunned on the cricket fields and quit on his dream in disgust. Now, he's caught between his daughter's dreams, talent and joy as a footballer; his assumption is that she will face the same indignities he had. He watches part of a match where Jess is obviously fouled by a white girl, but when Jess reacts badly it is she that draws the red card; thus enforcing her father's conclusion. There is also his wife's insistence that Jessminder must pursue a traditional life in the role of a subservient Hindu wife and mother. After the championship game, when the family discovers that Jess scored the winning goal, and has won a scholarship to play soccer in America, Father succumbs and refuses to deprive his daughter of the happiness that he threw away. At the end, both Jules's and Jess's families are saying goodbye at the airport. Jess's passionate kisses with the coach seemed ignored by her mother. I find this a script flaw. A Hindu mother (and most other mothers) would've reacted and could've been a nice comical ending moment. There was some predictability to the story, and I felt the end was a bit rushed. But all-in-all I found it an enjoyable and memorable movie from start to finish.",Bend It Like Beckham

240,jeannine1980,No pact with the devil here,9,22 March 2005,"My scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when I vowed I love this film. Bring on the coals; I'll walk over them as well to say again that I love ""Bend it Like Beckham."" Granted, there's a lot of ""in spite of"" in that confession. It's a bit movie-of-the-week; the screenplay is on the paint-by-numbers side. And, most troublingly, the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.The film's genius is not in what's obvious to the Syd Field-doctored eye: character arcs, themes, construction. It's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath, but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at. Powerful, sometimes semi-clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi will ever do. These are real bodies (Keira Knightley's excepted) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later. They are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self-determination. And, in my book, lead actress Parminder Nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective, ""luminous,"" but because her performance has an honesty and un-bookish intelligence that's utterly compelling.The result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a pact with the devil to do so. As in Chadha's ""Bride and Prejudice,"" the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy, Sweet Valley High categories of ""best friends"" or ""sisters."" Perhaps Chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism. ""Bend it Like Beckham"" has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple hetero/homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest. The precise nature of its pleasure is, ultimately, a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for it.Oh yes, and did I mention that it's hilarious?",Bend It Like Beckham

242,paul-1722,An Enjoyable Movie,8,26 December 2008,"Okay, lets state the obvious, this is not an art movie.However, I enjoyed it, and I think it is well developed. The movie is known internationally but was written for a British audience.So, for the benefit of non-UK audiences, and perhaps younger UK audiences, it should be put into context.Parminder's father makes reference to coming from Nairobi, Kenya and is thus presumed to be a middle class Indian who has come to the UK and has got stuck in a lowly paid job at Heathrow airport. He is not directly from India. (note that the director, Gurinder Chadha, is also an Indian Sikh from Kenya).A bit of history here. Following the contraction of the British Empire after WW2, Kenya (a part of British East Africa) gained independence from Britain, and subsequently kicked out the Indian middle class in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Some found political sanctuary in the UK where they still experienced racism and bigotry. However, there was and is, a strong Indian community in the outer Western suburbs of London which is where this film is set, which is also close to Heathrow airport (hence all the low-flying planes).So, the mother and father are political migrants who came from a country where their culture was important to them, and where they are presumed to have been relatively wealthy but are not so wealthy now.The culture clash is a fairly simple plot, and appears in many movies so I wouldn't patronise anyone explaining this.Later in the movie, we see a sumptuous wedding scene which featured a fair amount of Bhangra music (look it up on Wikipedia) which is, in this movie, a fusion of Punjabi traditional music with more contemporary Western musical instruments ,which is why it is to toe-tappingly good! This is another example of the fusion of the cultures in this movie.I really enjoy this movie when I see it. The characters are well developed, and although often bigoted, none of them are idiots. They may hold strong views, but they can't be hated for this. I think the best character was Jules' mother who got some of the best lines in the movie. And as been pointed out by others, it is refreshing to see that none of the males in the movie were presented as imbecilic morons just to make a cheap point. Okay, some of Jess's male football playing friends in the park were a bit dim, but none more so that Pinky's female friends.Keira Knightly's performance was a bit wooden, but at least she keeps male viewer's attention!

247,lycanthrop,More Hype,3,3 May 2002,"As usual yet another grin a little, slightly feel good film from the local producers here. The creator of this film is a genius. Use the flavour of the day as a hot title, throw in some ethnic eccentricities and a few flashes of ladies involved in sporting activity and there you have it, a ""hit"" movie.To be honest the main grins were from the efforts of Shaheen Khan who played the mother of our main actress. There were the few occasional gems from the others. For a movie than was based on the formula mentioned above, there was enough ethnic background but very little soccer involved. Clever editing and camera angles hid the main characters' lack of footie abilities. Truthfully there is actually only one shot of our main actress doing a light curl on a shot at a washing line and that was about it. Rather disappointing when the estimated half that involved football you only get to see a player rush towards the football, swing her feet at it and a sudden shift to a ball entering the goal mouth.Many may argue defensively that this was not a football movie despite the working title, well tough. I can't really sing accolades about this film like the others. I guess I am not easily amused by light slapstick and light everything. Would I recommend this movie to anyone else? Well, when asked I will give a lopsided grin and that's about it.",Bend It Like Beckham

It's a film that men and women can enjoy equally.This is still my favourite Keira Knightly film (though I've yet to see Atonement. Parminda Nagra is also great as Jess. They both are believable as footballersThe ending is a bit corny with Jess scoring the winner with a Beckham like free kick, especially as the way she kicks it would cause the ball to canon into the wall.

The football was impressive, the cultural issues were intriguing, and the tone was light-hearted.  The acting was very well-done, subtle, and the facial expressions were brilliant.And Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is just beautiful.I was a bit surprised to hear that the U.S. women's soccer was apparently so big, as I don't know many who are fans.  I did some research and found that the U.S. has the largest pro women's soccer leagues in the world.  How about that?",Bend It Like Beckham

Even when I think of it now it brings a smile.This is a feel good film, thats all it is and a brilliant one it is too.The sound track is mind blowing.  I'm sure a lot of British Asians can relate to this film and get alot of the in-jokes that may be a bit thin on others.The film is about a 18 year old asian girl, who wants to break with tradition and become a footballer just like her idol David Beckham.She joins a womans football team, which clashes with her family life.  She has to chose between strict indian traditions or football.
The plot isn't very complicated, and for this kind of film i dont think it should be.  But it does keep you interested until the end.So go and watch this film, it is not average. For get the world and your troubles for two hours and enjoy.a definite 9/10",Bend It Like Beckham

As a British born Punjabi, I could identify with key points and loved the odd moments of hysteria (spoken in Punjabi) by Jess's mother, Mrs Bhamra - boy have we all been there, ""Ohh Baba-ji ..."". The determination by the young football player to forge a career in a non traditional Asian occupation was inspiring and our hearts went out to the poor girl. Parminder Nagra was well supported by Archie Punjabi who is gorgeous, articulate and highly talented - what a babe - I think I'm in love! Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), a well respected Bollywood star helped to make this movie enjoyable but I don't think his real skills were exploited in this movie. Nevertheless, I would recommend this movie to most people but a must for young Asians living in a western society, as well as their parents of course. Both could learn a lot from each other. Music was great too - Loved the wedding bits, just brought back memories for me - You just can't beat a Punjabi Wedding - thumping Bhangra beats just get my shoulders going.

There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension. They not only spare the audience this, but throw in some surprises at the same time. There are a few Disney-ish moments, particularly near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth the rental and it was good, relaxed fun.BTW, if you get the DVD, watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi.

Because I had the talent, but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy, as well the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit soccer.And soccer is the red line in this movie. Together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the English family with a daugther who dresses like a boy, and plays soccer... a combination which worries her mother! This movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It is about believe in your dreams, and live your one life (where did we hear that before).Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful women!) plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff. In contradiction with her sister Pinky, complete the opposite of Yasminda.A real must it is, to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents, and finds her luck eventually. With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hit songs.Pleasant to watch, but if you, as myself, ever played soccer, and never made it to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.",Bend It Like Beckham

The casting is superb -- characters' accents seem just what they ought to be, and actors enrich the story greatly by how well they convey attitudes and whole situations with their interactions and other behaviour.

Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Jules' push-up bra mum.The movie deftly mixes football prodigy Jess' head-on clashes with her sweet but traditionally minded parents and her developing relationship with Jules, her football buddy.

The filmmakers successfully portray two young women who are brought alive through playing soccer, which is their greatest love; but both are struggling against the conventional values of their families. In the case of Jules, her mother is in despair about her daughter's apparent lack of interest in the opposite sex and unwillingness to behave or dress in a more feminine manner to make herself attractive. Jess, who is the main focus of the film, struggles to find herself as the daughter of a conventional Indian family. She yearns only to play soccer, at which she excels, but is conflicted because the demands of her family, which dictate other behavior for a good girl of this culture.

274,mcvitie_hehe,So much more than you'd expect!,10,25 April 2002,"As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film, although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II. The trailers looked fun so I thought I'd give it a go.It took about ten minutes but after that I was glued to the screen, and that wasn't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium. The acting was fresh and vibrant, the characters engaging, and the jokes genuinely funny. The entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so. Football fan or no football fan, sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time, dare I say it.... better than East is East.This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace, never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. Though not a characteristically twisting-and-turning film, there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don't always happen as you would expect.Saying that, there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script-fillers. I suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy-endings you could be either delighted/let down by the ending. Personally, if there was any other outcome I would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers.As for the actors, I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) put in the finest performance. I never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do! Prize for the most unconvincing (of the main characters) goes, unfortunately, to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but don't get me wrong, even she offered a great performance, it's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry Kiera, this time you're it.Tip: Don't leave before the credits. Once the lights came back up I realised to my horror that perhaps I shouldn't have watched this film after all. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice.

There is a typical British humour combined with serious cultural problems, but they are also presented in a funny way. The film is about a teenage girl whose Sikh family lives in the London area near Heathrow Airport. The protagonist is Jess or Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra), who loves playing soccer. Her inspiration is David Beckham and she has a large picture of him in her bedroom. But she is still a teenager, who lives with her conservative parents. She starts playing for a team of girls, but she has to do it without the knowledge of her parents, because they would not allow her. Jess's family is planning all for the wedding of her older sister, so first nobody notices Jess' problems.

They play well together in the soccer team, but their problem is their handsome Irish coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), in whom they both fall in love. To give this all an amusing touch, Jules' parents furthermore think the girls have a lesbian relationship. These are the main problems and if you want to know, how these problems will be solved, you have to watch it. Although I think, that the movie is nice, I have expected too much from it.

283,blizz_storm,Bend It Like Beckham,8,5 December 2006,"BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, a film review by Jennifer MillsThe movie ""bend it like Beckham"" by Gurinder Chadha, is a movie about two together clashing cultures in Britain, in which the main character, Jesminder Bhamra, tries to fulfill her dream of being a professional football player. Including funny sequences, a love triangle, sports action and an Indian wedding, the movie fills every part of entertainment - it even throws up the conflict between sexuality in Indian and British culture. To strengthen the plot, Chadha uses very characteristic characters. One the one hand, there is Jess, who tries to fulfill her dream as a professional football player and still tries to satisfy her family in being a traditional Indian girl. Jules has similar problems - her mother does not like her way of clothing either, nor does she like her playing football. Jules mother is a very society orientated person, who misunderstands her daughter often, which leads to a sexual misunderstanding, in which she thinks, her daughter and Jess are lesbian, and goes beyond the scope on Pinkys, Jess' sister, wedding. Joe, the coach of the football team in which Jess and Jules play, is the trigger for a bad argument between Jess and Jules.As you see, there are a lot of things to discover in this movie. It definitely won't get boring - even if you watch it more often. And even if you don't like the plot (which is not very likely) I promise you will look at other cultures different after you watched the movie - maybe you will even find similarities between Jess' and your life. My suggestion to you is: watch the movie! You won't regret it - IF so, then you are not up to a different point of view. So are you ready?",Bend It Like Beckham
284,funnything,nice idea - good actors - a little bit kitschy,7,7 December 2006,"I have seen Bend it like Beckham"" and I think it's a good movie if you like romantic movies that always deal with the same topics. This film is about an Indian family who lives in England. The main part of the plot is about Jesminder Bhamra who played a lot of football in her free time in the park. Until she met Jules who plays in a professional girl team and offers her to take part in a workout. The problem is that her Indian family, especially her mother, has a problem with Jess' passion. They complain about Jess showing her bare legs in a typical masculine physical exercise. She pretends that she has a job so she can play football after school. Her coach, the good-looking Joe, supports her in every way. Of course Jess falls in love with him which also causes an argument with Jules. As a second story thread the movie deals with the wedding of Jess' sister Pinky who is going to marry on the same day that Jess has her final game. So she has to decide. To sum up, I can recommend this film only for people (better: girls) who are looking for a romantic movie they can watch without having big stuff to think about. But for them it's a really well made film with a nice plot.-Svenja-",Bend It Like Beckham
285,wasch_michael,A great movie with a thoughtful and well developed story,9,8 December 2006,"If you wonder what the post-colonial experience in the British society and a first class culture clash, soccer being its center, look like, you definitely need to find out about the story Indian teenager Jess (Parminder Nagra) from Houslow, Greater London, has to tell us. Having been playing soccer in the park a lot and watching it on TV, Beckham being her idol, Jess has taken a stand, no matter if her conservative Indian parents accept it or not. Soccer is her life and Jess' dream is about playing it professionally one day ""No more football!"", Jess's mother, Mrs. Bhamra, demands, but Jessminder doesn't care. Playing on the Hunslow Harricrs' team she's found her way and is happy. It takes several conflicts with her family regarding the clash between traditional values and a modern British society, until Jess' father, Mr. Bhamra, realizes that ""anybody has the right of stopping her"" if soccer is Jess' life. Eventually, there's a Happy End to the movie, although the viewer might be surprised how quickly things can change in the Bhamra family considering the parents' original opinion on Jess playing soccer. In addition, Jess' crush for Joe, the coach, seems unimportant but not schmaltzy. However, it doesn't really contribute to the overall success of the movie. Gurinder Chadha does an awesome job, no doubt. You definitely need to watch the whole movie a couple of times to notice all the details and to fully realize the whole dimension of the conflict explained in that great movie.",Bend It Like Beckham
286,anna88,Bend it like Beckham,6,10 December 2006,"Interesting plot-unrealistic ending. Gurinder Chadha's ""Bend it like Beckham"" deals with Jess (Parminder K. Nagra) a young Indian girl with only one passion -football. During the movie Jess meets Jules (Keira Knightly), a member of a real football team for girls, who takes her to one of their trainings. And now? Yes you're right! Jess plays so brilliant that she becomes one of the main players of the team.But stop...there is a problem. Jess's traditional Indian parents don't want that their daughter plays football. So she doesn't tell them and begin to live a double life. But what is a respectable teenager- movie without a love story? Surely we have love in here. Jess and Jules both fall in love with their handsome coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys- Meyers)what makes the situation much more complicate. In the end Jules and Jess are discovered by a famous football coach and start a career in America. That's real life isn't it?Although the ending is obvious from the beginning the movie shows us cultural differences mixed with sport and love in an interesting and sometimes really funny way.

287,xShanjax,Bend It Like Beckham (2002),4,10 December 2006,"The movie ""Bend it like Beckham"" by Gurinda Chadha made in 2002 deals with the conflict between cultures and conflicts between generations, but it's also a comedy and romance.The main character Jesminder ""Jess"" Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra) loves soccer and David Beckham. When she gets the chance to play in a real soccer team for girls, of course she uses it, but then the problems begin. Her parents don't allow her to play soccer. They would like to see her cooking and married. So Jess must play secretly. In a good movie should not be missing a love story, so there is the young handsome Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the soccer coach of Jess. of course Joe and Jess fall in love with each other and everything could be good if not Jess's best friend Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), who had invite Jess to play in the soccer team, fall in love with Joe, too. It's obvious that Jules and Jess have a big argument. Into the bargain Jess is not allowed to have a boyfriend and hey sister Pinkie's wedding will be on the same day as her final soccer game.But at the end everything comes like it must: Jules and Jess become friends again. Jess's father allows her play at the game so that she gets a scholarship and can study together with Jules in America. Also Jess is allowed to have a relationship with Joe. And not to forget they all see David and Victoria Beckham at the airport. A perfect Happy End. Everything is good and everybody is happy.I think the movie has a convincing plot and is a little bit boring, but it has a wonderful message. We all should fight against discrimination and live our dreams. It's interesting to watch the movie, but one time is enough.",Bend It Like Beckham
288,YCiftci,"Review of ""Bend it like Beckham""",8,10 December 2006,"The movie ""Bend it like Beckham"" produced in 2002 by Gurinder Chadha, is a well-written, funny and heart warming film with a nice message about being true to your own dreams.I have watched this film for the first time in 2003 when I have met some friends for a movie night. Although I don't like football the film sounded interesting for me, especially of the subtitle ""Who wants to cook Aloo Gobi, when you can bend a ball like Beckham?"" It is a sports movie with the usual sports clichés, but it also includes a nice romantic comedy and a good drama about a young woman from an Indian/Sikh family living in England who wants to follow her dreams of football. Otherwise she learns that her wishes are in conflict with the desires of her parents and her cultural traditions. Moreover the film celebrates the exuberant lifestyle of the Indian people, who know how to party and so a big wedding is a key part of the film. The film's main character is the 18  year  old Sikh girl Jesminder Bhamra (played by Parminder Nagra) who is a very talented football player and has a real chance to play professionally. In addition her big idol is David Beckham to whom poster she talks in a way how some people talk to God. However, her parents think that football is a waste of her time, because they want her more likely to study and become a solicitor. Beyond it, they want a marriage for her with a nice Indian boy from a good family and even to cook Aloo Gobi. Jesminder becomes also less support from her sister Pinky, because she has exclusive interests in fashion and her marriage which is approaching. Accidentally, her talent is noticed by the footplayer Juliette Paxton (played by Keira Knightley), when she was playing in a park with the local boys. She invites her to join a women's football team. She happily accepts to join the club, even though she knows her parents would disapprove. Jesminder becomes a key member of the side and Juliette's best friend with whom she shares her dreams and similar cares. But complications arise when she and Juliette are both attracted to the same man, the Irish coach of the team, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). By the way Jesminder uses a series of lies and deceptions to get her way and her involvement in modern British society, which also gets her family into enough trouble with the Indian community. Although her father wants her to be happy, he also feels she won't be given a fair chance at a football career, because of racism. In addition her mother forces her daughter to be more traditional, like her sister, Pinky. The movie also shows that immigrant families are not unique in their adherence to tradition. Juliette's mother also doesn't hold much from the sport ambitions of her daughter. Hilariously, she fights with her 'shock', because she thinks that her daughter is in a lesbian relationship with Jesminder.As you see the resulting situation sets up a number of culture clashes between traditional values and a modern British society with a row of comical to serious moments, as Jesminder, her friends and family, try to negotiate their way between the expectations of this two cultures and their own dreams and desires. Although you can almost guess what is happening at next, there are some turning-points, which brings many questions up in your mind. Will Jesminder really live her dream? What happens to her romance with Joe? Will she get on well again with Juliette? What about her football career in future? You want to know it? Well, then watch the movie and find it out! All in all it is a well-directed movie with some really convincing effects, acting and Dialogues, which shows a typical problem of people living between two cultures with which you can identify with. In my opinion I would recommend this movie for all people, who experiences difficult times, because it is a really feel-good-movie.",Bend It Like Beckham

290,mr_viktor23,Bend it like B,3,10 December 2006,"The movie ""Bend it like Beckham"" do not impress me. Because of the weak story and the inexperienced actors it is very prospective and the plot gets boring. The mixture of some soccer scenes and a little brawl between two girls is really ridiculous. The only way to keep this movie alive is to tell about the disparities between the English and the Indian culture. Because of the old tradition to arrange the marriage of an own daughter you see in this movie the change. So the children get more freedom and respect in this society.Overall this movie are not really a hit so it depends on the viewer and on his/her expectations and preferences towards movies.I would not promote this film.khm2",Bend It Like Beckham
291,theseven,Becks - How embarrassing,3,12 December 2006,"You like football and you are interested in this movie? Then I have to disappoint you This story of an Indian teenager girl, named Jessminder Bhamra, is based on the culture clash of India and Great Britain. The football shows up the disparities between Indian tradition and modern British life. That sounds interesting, but the whole implementation seems to be very wishy-washy. Everything which has to do with Indian culture creates a cliché atmosphere and seems to be exaggerated. The main actors Parminder Nagra (Jessminder), Keira Knightley (Jules, Jessminder's best friend) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Joe, the coach) made a good job and fit very well to their roles. Nevertheless, the talent of the young actors is clouded by unrealistic football scenes. Also the love story between Joe and Jessminder is so senseless for the plot that you can go meanwhile to the freezer and get a new drink, without missing something important. The climax of absurdity is still the mother of Jessminder's best friend Jules. Only because her daughter plays football and hugs other girls she thinks Jules is lesbian. I think if they would cut every scene of her, nobody would notice it. Of course nobody could forecast the happy ending of the movie. Jessminder wins her last football match at her sister's wedding day, gets a free scholarship on an American college and finally her parents accept their daughter's passion. Result: This movie is neither comedy, nor sports movie. And if you are interested in culture you can read 5 minutes in Wikipedia and you get more information than watching this UK-supported Bollywood trash.Henning Schultz",Bend It Like Beckham
292,simon-rommeswinkel,More a bad pass than a brilliant free kick!,2,12 December 2006,"The movie ""Bend it like Beckham"", produced by Gurinder Chadha in 2002, disappointed me! It is in part a very funny and good performance, but just a movie without serious messages and a lot of flaccidity. ""Anyone can cook aloo gobi, but who can bend a ball like Beckham?""Jessminder ""Jess"" Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) is an eighteen year old Sikh girl who lives with her Indian family in London. Her passion of playing football and her dream to become a professional football player clashes with her conservative Indian culture. Jess' parents wants her to be a proper Indian girl, so there are obvious problems when Jess meets Jules (Keira Knightley) ,who invites her to join her woman's football team. They both fall in love with Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) , the coach of the team and it develops another conflict. The other storyline is based on Pinky, Jess' sister, who is going to marry an Indian man very soon. In the end, the conflict of British and Indian culture gets to a climax and ends up with a totally stupid happy ending. Jess wins the most important match of the season while her sister Pinky celebrate her traditional wedding. Everything is alright and her parents even approve to a scholarship for Jess' on an American college. Good actors and some funny situations does let a film not be a good film. There are just too much mistakes on plot and editing. The first disturbing thing is that the whole story is predictable as if you would have seen this all before a thousand times. The culture conflicts are just connected to football to create the impression that this is a new idea. Another great problem is that the whole story is just unrealistic and absurd. There is never ,for example, a point in the movie where you will take the conflict of Jess and her parents as serious. Jess' parents catch her playing football without permission at least 3 or more times in the film, but it seems to be not important because the story just goes on and anyway in the end they just forget about it. You can forget about this movie, too. Perhaps you should watch it just one time so that you can see on your own how bad the editing is. I thought ""Bend it like Beckham"" is a Hollywood production but all these mediocre montage sequences with the strange music in the foreground let me think of a Bollywood musical from India. At least, this film has nothing to do with David Beckham, football or Indian culture, but uses all these topics to create a flat comedy without sense or important content. So, if you want an entertaining senseless movie and nothing more, watch it!",Bend It Like Beckham
293,carmen_rezvani,Everything works out quite easily - an ending where all problems just melt away,5,12 December 2006,"Bend It Like Beckham is a British movie released in 2002, directed by Gurinder Chada. It tells of a young British Indian Sikh, Jesminder Bhamra, who struggles against her families' tradition to full fill her dream of playing professional football. Unlike a conventional Indian girl, who learns to cook the traditional Indian dishes and get married to a nice young Indian man like Jess' sister Pinky, Jess aspires to achieve the success of her idol, football star David Beckham. When she meets Jules, who lives in a European family and also shares a passion for football, she grabs the chance to join the Hounslow Harriers, the local woman's team. When they both fall in love with their coach Joe, their friendship is tested. Jess has to keep this entire secret from her family, which proves to be really hard.The movie describes the everyday life of an Indian family and what problems there can be in a modern society for an Indian girl who wants to go her own way.The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality, as when, for instance, Jules' parents labour under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers. The football isn't really real - the footy scenes are so incredibly fake and incorrect; and that last free kick is pathetic. The plotting, in addition is being predictable at times, for example, I wasn't moved by any sweetness, because anyone could guess that it was coming. Furthermore the love story is never really finished - Jules just accepts everything? The same goes for the story of Tony, a good friend of Jess...how does that play it out?When you are looking for some very dramatic scenes or a very deep story, than this isn't the movie you should go for. But when you want to have some lighter, but nevertheless very decent entertainment, than this is perhaps a movie that you should give a try. In closing, you won't be bored, but you won't be thrilled either.",Bend It Like Beckham

The traditional ways of the Indian family certainly did not sit well on the shoulders of a young 19 year old girl growing up in London. The opening was superb, and I like the rest of the people in the theatre thought this girl playing for England was for real, only to find that it was all in her head.Some superb shots of London at it's best(meaning summer), was lovely to see.Good interplays between the English (of Caucasian decent) and the Indian characters.An all together excellent film, thoroughly recommended.",Bend It Like Beckham
302,ugmy,Cheer Up Girls!! I Love Football!!,8,9 June 2008,"""Bend it like Beckham"" This movie has nothing to do with David Beckham, famous football player. It is a comedy of teenage Indian British girl who live in London. Here are the main characters!! Jess is heroine of this movie. Jules is a member of the girl's football team. Joe is a coach of the girl's football team. Pinky is Jess's older sister. Tony is Jess's friend. He is an Indian British boy. The Story!! Jess feels great interest in football. However, her family doesn't feel good about her because they are Indian family that treasures their traditional very much. Her mother is against football and wish Jess to behave more womanly. One day, Jules see Jess playing football at the park and scout Jess to the girl's football team. Thanks to Tony, Jess decides to join team secretly. As time passes, Jess becomes close friends with Jules and Joe. Meanwhile, Pinky and her family are busy preparing for Pinky's wedding. Pinky follows her traditional and marry Indian guy. At the last minute, it comes out that Jess has been telling a lie to her family and she is in love with a white boy Joe. There for, Jess's dad doesn't allow Jess to go to a football game but the game is very important for her because talent scout for famous football school is coming to see the game. What Jess is going to do next? My Review!! This is a hilarious movie so every time I watch this movie, I always feel happy, excitement and refreshment. I like chick flicks which teenage girl is trying to do her best to make her dreams come true. It always encourages me to do something. All chick flicks has to be a predictable movie and this movie as well. However, this is entertaining movie so you can enjoy it just for fun. Especially, I really enjoy football game scene. The screen play of Indian family is very funny. This movie tells you about importance of dream, hope and courage. We never make our dreams come true without difficulties. Therefore, this movie tells you a message ""Never give up"". Also it tells that family always be your great support. It is very heart-warming part. I like most of the plot but there is one that I don't. The part that I don't like about the plot is the eternal triangle among Jess, Jules and Joe. Not only Jess but also Jules loves Joe. I hate watching people being in love with his or her best friend's favorite person.",Bend It Like Beckham

What made it the first film I've seen in decades that made me wish it would never end?First, I think it is the absence of evil; the most destructive bit is the history of Joe's ruining his football career by playing injured and wanting to prove strength to his father; but even this, like every complication in the plot, derives from people wishing for good.  The flower of the film is Jess' silent weeping, cleaning her boots, when it appears she won't be able to reach her dream.  There's nothing vindictive or unfeeling in her confinement by her sister's wedding except her solitude with her love for football.  The power of the denouement is not simply permission to go to Santa Clara, but the first recognition by a member of her family, her father, of the intensity of her love for the game.We admire Jesminda for stubbornly bending the rules, but she hits an insurmountable wall; only her father's recognition in her of his own thwarted love as a fastballer, his astonishment at her ""brilliance,"" breaks her from the wedding and from the solicitor/medical career as gray as the bathrobe in which she trudged upstairs to her room with news of being accepted to university.The affective quality of the flower is consistent, as far as I can tell, throughout this film and its making: Chadha's laughing about her own mother's bossiness as an extra on the set is the same guiding principle of the plot and the characters, and permeates every scene and sound of the film.I'll probably go see it again.",Bend It Like Beckham
320,mark-hromalik,Totally Joyful!,10,4 June 2003,"My wife and I loved ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and consider it one of the best movies of all time!  We had such a good time...like we did when we saw ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" but that happy film didn't make me almost break down (literally) in tears of joy like ""Beckham"" did!  Most reviewers agree with my assessment.  The few that haven't?  Well, when they saw it, were they not feeling well?  Were they distracted by worry or pain...or drink?  Ha!  Do they not have a warm heart?  Did they even really see the movie?  I can't believe it!I really miss ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" and I have to go see it again soon. I also know what I'm getting everybody I know for Christmas, but I better ask them if they already own the DVD/video--By December, they all probably will! And for the first time in my life--I'm a soccer fan!  And you don't have to be a soccer fan to love this movie.  The love, warmth and humor, plus the attractiveness of all the characters make it all worthwhile.  Don't miss it! Experience the joy!",Bend It Like Beckham
321,ladypilot,"This film is more than just ""cute""",8,25 July 2003,"There's a lot of talk about Bend it like Beckham being a cute feelgood movie. And it is - it's a warm comedy, with a predictable feelgood ending. But there is more to it than that! It uses the predictability of the plot to make clever points about prejudice, and about how having an open mind really can make your life richer. But most importantly, Bend it like Beckham has a female perspective rarely seen in hit movies. It shows young women as strong, active, bloody minded, funny and clever. If I had a teenage daughter I'd drag her along to the cinema to watch this. Mind you, I'd make my son see it too. In short, I found this film refreshingly modern, with a feminist bite behind all the ""cute"" stuff. On top of that Keira Knightley makes a great performance, and the normally flamboyant Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the fanciable coach with subtle perfection. Top stuff.",Bend It Like Beckham

324,blue_mnm_chick,A gem for moviegoers and footballers alike,10,30 July 2003,"Despite the overflow of comparisons, I didn't find this movie to be anything like last year's hit, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  Although MBFGW was unique in it's own way, this British import is a hidden gem, even if you don't know the least bit about soccer or Great Britian's leagues.  I'm still a little bummed out about the commercial release of the film this Friday, since I've seen it twice in independent theatres since its original release in March. But I understand that this movie is destined to go far, and the commercial release will help it to do that.  In all this, I can't help but smile wide everytime I see another t.v spot for the film because it is just that great. The chances of me seeing a third time before it is released on DVD in the States are pretty high.  Not to mention the fact that it is one of the best movies I've seen all year.  So, if you have any inkling toward the idea of seeing a heartwarming film about overcoming incredible odds to achieve that ultimate ""goal"", check it out.  Bill me if you don't like it.",Bend It Like Beckham
325,demomoke,"excellent culture clash movie, but more there",9,28 September 2003,"I have to admit, I originally did not have much of a choice to see this movie.  I first saw it on an airplane flight from London to New York.  But because 1) I was enchanted with this movie, and 2) the other selections were awful, I ended up watching it three times on the plane.I'd heard good things about it in Britain, but had not seen any publicity in the States for it.  I was attracted to it because of my interest in seeing how different cultures interact when they meet.  The Bhamra family in ""Bend It"" is a perfect example of this phenomenon.  I've no idea what it would be like to experience culture shock, having lived my whole life in the U.S., but I imagine it is very difficult for the children of immigrants to walk the tightrope between respecting the culture of their parents and their native land, while not being able to help participating in the culture of the country in which they live, to which they are exposed constantly.Like I said, this is what originally attracted me to this movie, and it succeeded wonderfully at illustrating the clash between East and West, poking fun at some of the peculiarities of each, but never blatantly mocking either one.  However, the other part of the story is what makes ""Bend It"" a winner.  This part has to do with striving to achieve one's dreams, despite what others may have planned for you.Jess's parents want her to concentrate on university and finding a suitable (Indian) husband with whom to settle down, as her older sister Pinky is about to do.  Jess's whole world, on the other hand, is football (or soccer to my fellow Americans).  She knows she is very good, and through her English friend Jules, she hears of opportunities to pursue her football dreams, first as part of an all-girls squad in London, and later of university scholarships and professional teams in America, despite the cultural objections of her parents.While the romance/love triangle subplot did little to interest me, it was important, as it provides a vehicle for Jules's mother to act on her suspicions that her daughter is a lesbian, making for some hilarious comic relief near the end of the movie.Parminder Nagra scored big in her feature film debut as Jess (she can now be seen on ""ER"" on American television), while Keira Knightley (better known from ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") was fantastic as Jules.  The chemistry between them was evident, like they were teammates on a real football team, but that's what good actors and actresses are supposed to do.  Anupam Kher, a veteran of over 270 Bollywood films, does well in his minor role as Jess's father.  ""Bend It"" was his English-language debut.  Shaheen Khan was shrilly diabolical at times, but overall very good, as Jess's uptight mother.  Archie Panjabi was excellent as the shopaholic Pinky.  Juliet Stevenson was an absolute riot as Jules's harried and confused mother, and Frank Harper was solid as Jules's entirely supportive father.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers turned in a  quality performance as the coach of the all-girls football team, and the object of Jess's and Jules's affection.  I was impressed with the depth with which his charcter was explored, much more than I thought it would be.Overall a very different and enjoyable movie that most people (especially in soccer-hating America) would be better for seeing.",Bend It Like Beckham
326,basketball-bub,Extremely Good!,10,29 January 2004,"This film, set around the life of a young Indian girl who wishes to play soccer, is a very good portrayal of many subjects.

Greek Wedding was pretty cool as is this movie.An Irony from my perspective is that the main character's trials are strikingly similar in scope to a very good friend- and the choices between tradition and modern are a compromise for her every day.  Good lord knows she tries to accomidate everyone... (like the movie's character).Very good movie, more true than some realize and well worth seeing.",Bend It Like Beckham

330,iria_lestegas,Really a different movie than I thought. I'm glad I've seen it!,9,15 May 2004,"I first heard of this movie here in Spain in June 2003, but I wasn't really interested in it. It sounded to me like another stupid soccer movie, in order to give more money to Beckham (I can't stand soccer). But things changed when I went to the States in July. The 13-year-old girl in my host family wanted to see it at the cinema, so I went with her and her friends. Then I changed my mind and realized it was a very good movie and had nothing to do with what I thought. It combines sport, culture and life in a comedy way, and relates the increasing of culture problems and their religious differences when they have to coexist in our world. The central storyline is that Jess (Parminder K. Nagra), a Hindu girl, defies her family's expectations by playing soccer in a girl's team. Jess's English friend Jules (Keira Knightley), who is 16, also has problems with her mother, who tells her to be more feminine and stop playing soccer like a boy. Of course, there are love aspects. Both girls like the same boy, their coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), and that gives more interest and appeal to the movie. I especially liked Bend it like Beckham because it shows a certain point of view: the description of our world nowadays by contrasting two cultures coexisting in London, such as the occidental one and the Hindu habits. There are some aspects that are the same in most cultures, like mothers don't wanting their daughters to play soccer or do boy's activities. This is reflected in Jess, who, with a great potential in soccer, can't make at first her dream come true because of her culture.",Bend It Like Beckham
331,loupatterson,Genuinely enjoyable film - touching and humorous,10,13 June 2004,"Parminder Nagra is absolutely captivating; a refreshing change from the typical actress. She was unbelievably real in this role. You really believed she was the character, and felt the emotions, pain, and joys that she demonstrated. This is an actress that should go far, if given the opportunity. Her portrayal of Jess in this movie impressed me so much I even watched ER to see more of her. Gurinder Chadha did an excellent job in directing, and in the selection of the cast. The entire cast was well picked, and the chemistry was great. This is a movie I liked so much that I bought the DVD, and I have watched it repeatedly. I still laugh when I hear many of the lines. Great job to all, cast and director.

All actors and actresses give an extremely good performance, surpassing expectation in every way. Parminder Nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film, and she is exceptional, capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about.

So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion.First off, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy. It's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished.Secondly, the acting though not ""Halle Berry in Monster's Ball"" is still good. The movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly.Lastly, It has a really cute story. I think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch. It's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. If you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you.-Lyndsay",Bend It Like Beckham
334,jota-zeven,A good movie to teach culture and values,10,14 October 2013,"First, if someone asks for a movie to spend time with the family, friends, girlfriend, this means that the movie it is for everyone.Different themes are treated in the movie. for example, this cultural thing of customs and tradition that a family has, specially the ones which appear in the movie as we could see, dealing with Jess's family would be difficult for the kids that nowadays are.It is a good movie to teach teenagers about different cultures, values, problems that they may have (acceptation, curiosity, friendship, dreams, parent control, problems, etc) and also the movie reinforces how important is this magical tool that most of the time we keep in our pocket, and this is communication and trust. we can see this all over the movie in relation to Jess and her parents, the support that she wants but the support that she doesn't obtain because she cannot express what she really feels. Besides the traditional image of an Indian girl has to show, avoiding the critics against her family. And the only thing that she wants to do is play football, that was her dream, and the dreams can be true. I definitely recommend this movie, you don't even have to know or like football to enjoy it. It won't be a waste of time.",Bend It Like Beckham

With this said, it is also a romantic movie, that shows how love can interfere with friendship, hobbies and you're family.This is a movie to see with friends or alone. But when you see it, do not judge it upon the quality of the movie, but on the story, and the connection between the great actors. A movie does not have to have a very big budget, and the very best actors to be good. (but in this case i think that the actors really is great!)

336,twojeez,Great feel good movie,10,9 March 2005,"""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the U.S. It's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here. I think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. I was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now I regret not seeing it sooner. I highly recommend this movie!",Bend It Like Beckham
337,mrxfack,Bend it like Beckham review,5,23 October 2014,"Bend it like Beckham was released 2002 and is a comedy, drama and romance movie about a teenage Indian girl rebelling against her parents. The movie was directed Gurinder Chadha ho I also known for 'Paris, je t'aime', 'Bride and Prejudice' and 'Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging'.Bend it like Beckham is about reaching your goals even if it means you need to bend the rules. The movie is based around Jesminder Bhamra for short she's called Jess. She's the daughter of a highly traditional family from India who do not understand her desire of playing football. For them learning to make food and getting a husband are more important then football. If the movie sounds cliché, it's probably because it is rather cliché. You could probably guess the ending of the movie accurate with what I've told you. The movie doesn't tell you much you did not know about Indian culture, and even worse it touches on homophobic attitude of religious cultures for 3 minutes and drops it for the rest of the movie. Why would you have a gay character if you were never going to anything with it? The movie also attempts to show racism but that's also barely touched on. The movie is obviously just a football movie with a lot of tacked on content to cover the lack of depth. Tacked on content isn't bad it's just when it's done half-way and about such important topics. The movies saving grace are the actors who do their best to give life to the two dimensional characters. It's rather hard to find one bad actor in the movie, but by no means is the writing their working with any good. The movie is overall predictable, cliché and a bundle of half-done side content. There is not real reason for anyone to watch the movie at all it adds nothing new ore fresh to the world. The movie feels from beginning to end like a shore and that's when a movie truly fails. Even children I can see getting bored by the movie, I can't recommend the movie to anyone at all open hearted. The movie over all gets three out of six. It's not bad it's just so cliché and so meaning less that there is no reason to kill time watching the movie.",Bend It Like Beckham

I've not seen a lot of films in my life but this one is a very special one. ""Bend it like Beckham"", directed by Gurinde Chadha in 2002, deals with culture problems, soccer, friendship and love. The film is set in London. The story is very interesting and engrossing. An Indian family has a soccer-playing daughter, named Jesminder, who wants to play football professionally like her idol Beckham, but she gets many problems. One day Jesminder plays football in the Hounslow Park with her friends. A girl, whose name is Jules, watches her for a few minutes. She is fascinated by Jess' skills. She walks over to the group, introduces herself and invites Jess to a trial at the Hounslow Harrier. This dialogue invites their upcoming friendship. At Jess' first trial she is very nervous. Before she runs over to the coach Joe and Jules, she watches the training for some time. Jess is so fascinated how the girl play football. Joe looks skeptical and asks her which position she usually plays. Then she starts her warm-up and begins to play together with the team. After the training Joe is convinced and Jess gets a chance to play football professionally. A few days later she meets her friends in the park,she comes from her football training. Suddenly Mrs Bhamra, her mother, sees her while she is running around with half-naked boys. Her mom takes her at home. At home Jesminder and her parents have a discussion. Mr and Mrs Bhamra don't want this shame on her family. Jesminder should learn full Punjabi dinner, meat and vegetarian, and she should behave like a proper women. Her parents forbid Jesminder to play football. Also the think that they have enough problems with her sister Pinky, who wants to marry in the next weeks. Jesminder is sad and doesn't know what she could do, because she doesn't want to giver her dream up. Therefore she decides to play football secretly. But later she has to make a choice between football and tradition, because the weeding from her sister is at same day as a important football match. This match offers her the chance to get a scholarship. Will Jess go to the important game or is it the end of her dream to become a star like Beckham. But to find out how the film ends you have to view it yourself. In addition all the cinematic devices used in this film serve a function and achieve their intended effect, for example the situation in the living-room when Jess' parents talk to her. The high-angle shot presents the inferiority of Jess. It shows that Jess is desperate,sad and shy. The medium shot of her allows the viewer to see the situation from the position of the parents. On the other hand you can see that Mr and Mrs Bhamra are superior. The low-angle shot of them presents their fury and their disappointment. The music at the end underlines the bad situation. All this cinematic devices presents the situation from Jessminder's position. This scene is very important for the film, because the culture problems and the problems with her family begin. To sum up it is a very interesting, exited and easy understanding film. If I were ask to rate this film on a Scala from zero to ten, I would give it 8 points.",Bend It Like Beckham

This movie claims the cause of the women, Jess searches to improve in a boy's sport. It breaks the receive idea. The movie fights against sexism.

On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~",Bend It Like Beckham
