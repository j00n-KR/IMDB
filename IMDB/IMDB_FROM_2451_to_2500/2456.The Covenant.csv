0,bkoganbing,Aren't These Young Men Warlocks?,6,15 September 2006,"Ipswich, Massachusetts back in the day had quite a history. Four families saw relatives done in for witchcraft and a fifth seemed to have vanished without a male heir to pass the gift down to. Or so everyone thinks.Fast forward to the new millenia where four close friends who attend the same prep school share a secret passed down through the generations. They've got the power, but someone seems to be doing magic without a license. For reasons the plot doesn't go into the interloper seems to have it in for one of the four young warlocks, Steven Strait. He's the one that interloper Sebastian Stan is after. They've got quite a climatic battle of powers in the end, but nothing you haven't seen already if you are fan of the TV series Charmed.This is the second time I saw Sebastian Stan in something. He played the perpetrator on a Law and Order episode and in that one he's a nerdy kid with thick coke bottle glasses. His role here is miles from that and it shows me he's a player of a lot of promise. The Covenant is not great, but it's entertaining enough and the ending does leave open the possibility of a sequel if this film succeeds.",The Covenant
1,Leofwine_draca,Awful teen fantasy has zero redeeming features,1,16 May 2016,"THE COVENANT is an appalling teen horror film directed by Renny Harlin, the once-great purveyor of such delights as DIE HARD 2 and CLIFFHANGER. The mighty have fallen and there's no evidence of Harlin's skill in this boring and derivative little movie that plays as a gender-swap rerun of THE CRAFT. After a promising credits sequence bringing to life images of the witch burning in Salem in the 17th century, we're thrown into a usual high-school type movie except this time you get the impression they're trying to make a HARRY POTTER-type film for teenagers.Straight away we're in the middle of poor CGI special effects used for no reason other than to show special effects and a bunch of utterly uninteresting cast members who couldn't act their ways out of a paper bag. Particularly to blame is the awful Steven Strait, whose lead Caleb has to be one of the most routine leads I've ever watched in a film. This guy has no personality whatsoever, nothing that makes him stand out, and I was yawning every time he appeared on screen. Then again, his insipid love interest is no better, and it's little surprise that Harlin films her tattoos more often than her face.This almost plot less mess involves four young warlocks who use their powers in the local bars and nightclubs until another kid at the school is found dead. Then it turns out a fifth member of the group, supposedly dead, is more than alive and the film ends with a battle between he and Caleb. That's it. The other guys hardly get a look in and the Draco Malfoy lookalike barely registers despite figuring prominently during the first half. The ending has to be one of the worst I've seen, just a couple of guys hurling 'magic bolts' at each other until one dies. It lasts about twenty minutes and the FX are as crappy as ever. It reminded me a little of the ending of THE MEDALLION, but even Julian Sands and Lee Evans look like distinguished thespians in comparison to the guys on show here.One sub-plot involves a 'spider curse' that causes horrible bugs to crawl over the female victim, but even these critters are poor CGI animations that rob any of the gross-out factor that might otherwise have resulted. Harlin is clearly bored of his role, acknowledging that his material is tired and predictable and choosing to focus instead on young girls in their nightwear and young men nude in the changing rooms in a hope to keep his audience's attention. It doesn't work. There's nothing to recommend in this film whatsoever.",The Covenant
2,SnoopyStyle,Slow plodding and uninspired,4,27 June 2014,"There is the Power that people have harnessed over the centuries. After the persecution of the Salem witch trials, the Sons of Ipswich form a covenant of silence keeping a 300 year old secret. Four friends Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait), Pogue Parry (Taylor Kitsch), Tyler Simms (Chace Crawford) and Reid Garwin (Toby Hemingway) are all warlocks descendants of a coven of witches. The boys are from Spenser Academy, Sarah Wenham (Laura Ramsey) is the new girl, and Kate Tunney (Jessica Lucas) is their friend. There is a fifth line of witches long thought lost. Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan) is another kid in the school.The powers are way too magical, way too random, and way too powerful. It's unreasonable for anybody to keep this a secret. There are no rules to their powers and it's hard to see its limits. The guys are interchangeable. There are too many lookalike pretty boys. Quite frankly, Steven Strait doesn't have it to stand out as the lead in this movie. Also it doesn't really set up the danger that well. The movie generally rambles on and on without any flow. It is in need of a villain early on for the guys to battle. Instead it's trying to be a mystery as to who the villain is and I don't really care. It's just not that compelling.",The Covenant
3,claudio_carvalho,"Very Entertaining, But Could Be Much Better",6,16 May 2007,"In 1692, in the Ipswich Colony of Massachusetts, five families of powerful witches commit to a covenant of silence to protect themselves against the witch hunters, but one of the families transgress their pact and is banished from their lands. Along the centuries, the power and the covenant are transmitted through their descendants and when the eldest son is eighteen years old, he ascends to a higher power. However, the use of magic addicts and if used in excess, ages the warlock. In the present days, four wizards teenage friends are in high school and their leader Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) is close to his eighteenth birthday and consequently to ascend. He has just met Sarah Wenham (Laura Ramsey) and they are dating, when the appearance of darkling and supernatural dreams haunt the group. Sooner they find an evil warlock, descendant of the fifth ancient family that wants to strip Caleb's power.I liked ""The Covenant"", a supernatural teenager movie in the style of ""Angel"", Buffy"", ""Charmed"" or ""Supernatural"". This film has good special effects, but the story and characters are not well-developed and some lines are terrible. The acting is only reasonable, but Laura Ramsey is extremely beautiful and natural in her great performance, and I liked this unknown actress. In the end, I found ""The Covenant"" very entertaining, but could be better and better with minor improvements in the screenplay. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Pacto"" (""The Covenant"")",The Covenant
4,kosmasp,Star vehicle,7,16 August 2020,"I guess I gave this some bonus points just because of the actors involved. I know someone who might even give this more than just one bonus point for having Sebastian Stan in it. And that is ok, overall though this is not something special. It is decent and it has some interesting effects.Fun to see the lead actor of Blood Ties trying his fangs here ... getting a (power) taste actually. Easy to follow (no pun intended) and quite a few flaws and cliches to boot ... but all in good fun.",The Covenant
5,gavin6942,A Failed Spiritual Successor to the Lost Boys,6,16 October 2007,"The eldest born male in five Massachusetts families will grow up to become the inheritor of an ancient magical power. One of the boys is unknown, having been adopted by another family due to his parents' early death in a car crash. Not having been raised by those who know, he gets power hungry and doesn't know how to control the anger and lust inside him.This film was poorly rated and I'm not the least surprised. When I first saw the trailer in theaters I thought it was a really poor attempt to cash in on the teen market with hunky guys (who all have a vague resemblance to Josh Hartnett) and ""Cool"" computer effects. The film itself is slightly less teen-oriented than the trailer was, but I think overall the feeling is the same.In the start of the movie, I was pretty pumped. They opened with some cool occult background shots (like the start of ""Seven"") and played a remix of White Zombie's ""More Human Than Human"". Then we are led to a scene with boys jumping off a high cliff, reminiscent of a scene from ""The Lost Boys"". So my low hopes suddenly got raised. Which is too bad, because the Lost Boys feel died immediately and the good music didn't return until the credits, making this essentially a sandwich with really good bread, moldy cheese and rotten meat.A few times there is some attempt to actually have a decent plot. The rivalry over a young woman is nice and one scene showing what happens if you use up your magic too young was a great idea... but the film does everything it can to devolve into a basic war of white magic versus black magic. Think Saruman versus Gandalf from ""Lord of the Rings"", only everything is cliché and a waste of time.Yet another recent attempt at horror gone wrong. Rent it if you're curious (I don't regret watching it), but don't expect more than the typical Hollywood fluff that gets pumped out again and again. If none of these actors ever work on another film, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.",The Covenant
6,lee_eisenberg,"contrary to the ""Alamo Bay"" review, foreign directors don't always teach us about our sins",2,17 July 2007,"When I looked up Louis Malle's movie ""Alamo Bay"" - about the persecution of Vietnamese immigrants in Texas - on IMDb, the reviewer said that it often seems like foreign-born directors make movies in this country teaching us Americans about our misdeeds (aside from French-born Louis Malle directing ""Alamo Bay"", Swiss-born Marc Forster directed ""Monster's Ball"").I'll agree that this does appear to be the case. However, one foreign-born director who has never made a movie showing us Americans about our transgressions is Finnish-born Renny Harlin. While his early movie ""Prison"" (about a jail haunted by an executed inmate) and his famous ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" (starring then-wife Geena Davis) were fairly interesting, I have observed that the rest of his career has consisted of the worst kinds of Hollywood ultra-crap.Now, we add to this ""The Covenant"", a totally predictable demon/warlock story. It touts itself as dealing with a centuries-old battle between haunted families, BUT DO YOU REALLY IMAGINE THAT THEY INSERTED ANYTHING CREATIVE?!!!!!!!!! I guessed pretty much everything that was going to happen. Sure enough, it's also got the silliest kind of dialog. Is there any redeeming quality? Well, the flick understands what kind of movie it is and doesn't expect to win any Oscars or anything (it's probably safe to say that Renny Harlin shouldn't expect any Oscars in the near future).But my point is, this is a totally pathetic movie. Just avoid it and don't waste your money.",The Covenant
7,jboothmillard,The Convenant,1,10 February 2011,"The critics describe this as a re-imagining of The Craft, with boys instead of girls, obviously a really terrible one, from director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, Deep Blue Sea, The Exorcist: The Beginning). Basically the Sons of Ipswich, led by Caleb Danvers (Sky High's Steven Strait), are seemingly the baddest boys on the campus of Spenser Academy, and the four of them share a dark secret. They are all three-hundred year old warlocks, teenage descendants to some 17th century witches, i.e. a coven. Some fifth son shows up and threatens the lives of their loved ones, they must come together to stop him from stealing their powers and exposing the covenant. Okay, I will be honest, I didn't catch any of that stuff, I thought they were vampires or something, I was just hoping for gory or nude moments. Also starring Sebastian Stan as Chase Collins, Laura Ramsey as Sarah Wenham, Taylor Kitsch as Pogue Parry, Toby Hemingway as Reid Garwin, Jessica Lucas as Kate Tunney, Chace Crawford as Tyler Simms, Wendy Crewson as Evelyn Danvers and Stephen McHattie as James Danvers. As I said, I attempted to watch this, but it turned out to be so boring that I dozed off at one point, and I wasn't bothered at all, it isn't scary, it won't appeal to the teen audience it tries to entertain, and it looks like a film you'd see made for TV, it is just an embarrassing supernatural horror thriller. Poor!",The Covenant
8,BA_Harrison,Another low point in Harlin's career.,3,29 January 2015,"Four lifelong friends, known to their college pals as The Sons of Ipswich, share a special secret: they're the descendants of a centuries old coven of witches, each possessing incredible supernatural powers. As the eldest, Caleb (Steven Strait) is to be the first of the Sons to 'ascend', his abilities becoming even stronger on his impending 18th birthday, but there is another warlock on campus who wants Caleb's special powers for himself and who will do anything it takes to succeed.Director Renny Harlin has had quite the chequered career: he made his mark in the 80s with impressive horror movie Prison, followed by the third Nightmare on Elm Street sequel, The Dream Master. In the early 90s, he became one of the big Hollywood action movie directors, helming successful blockbusters like Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger. Then came the mega-budget disaster that was Cutthroat Island, after which Harlin bounced back with excellent The Long Kiss Goodnight. His first films of the new millennium were the god-awful Driven, followed by the mediocre Mindhunters.Next up was The Covenant, a supernatural thriller aimed squarely at the teenage market. Harlin opens his film with a scene highly reminiscent of a key moment in The Lost Boys, his four gifted protagonists jumping off a high cliff to disappear into the fog below; but where The Lost Boys was a whole lot of unpretentious fun that benefited from a great cast and witty writing, The Covenant is a virtually joyless affair, with a bland script from J.S. Cardone (whose other work includes crap slasher The Slayer and the equally dreadful vampire flick The Forsaken), forgettable performances from a cast chosen primarily for their good looks, and Harlin desperately relying on unimpressive CGI special effects to try and add a modicum of interest to affairs, to no avail.With one uninspired scene after another, the film builds painfully to a predictable climax in which Caleb faces his nemesis for a supernatural duel to the death. Undemanding teenage girls might enjoy the film for its frequent shots of shirtless hunks, while sexy Sarah Wenham, as Caleb's girlfriend Sarah, takes a PG-friendly shower for the benefit of the male viewers. Other than the eye-candy, there's very little to recommend this clunker to the young or old.",The Covenant
9,Coventry,You must only use these powers to annoy!,2,10 October 2007,"The producers of ""Underworld"" (u-oh), the director of ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" (oh no!) and the writer of ""Forsaken: Desert Vampires"" (ah crap!!) combined all their talents, if you can call it that, to bring us a wannabe cool but mainly infantile & stupendous fantasy-horror tale, and I already regret having wasted my time on it. Briefly put, ""The Covenant"" is Harry Potter aimed teenage girl audiences, meaning it features multiple shots of hunky twenty-something boys without shirts, fast cars and motorcycles and a whole lot of lousy CGI-effects and digital gimmicks. Four boys attending college in Massachusetts are the last descendants of supernaturally empowered 17th century families and gradually inherit more hocus-pocus strength. It's never fully clarified what higher purpose these powers serve, and so the boys exclusively use them to lift up girls' skirts, fool the local police authorities and challenge each other to macho showdowns. But then one day the fifth descendant of the presumed extinct family shows up in the schoolyard and he turns out to be a naughty one. ""The Covenant"" is an incredibly annoying effort, especially because it takes itself too damn serious. Despite all the implausible plot-elements and grotesque effects, all the players act like they're part of the most intellectual and eminent film production ever. The modest 90's film ""The Craft"" thrived on similar ideas (though with girls instead of boys), and at least that movie wasn't unnecessarily pretentious and pathetic. The climax is just plain dumb, with magic dodge ball games and ridicule modern slang one-liners (""You're my wi-atch"") to boot.",The Covenant
10,preppy-3,Drivel but nice to look at,4,18 September 2006,"This starts off OK with loud rock music pounding through the opening credits then slowly falls apart. I only saw the film two days ago and I'm already forgetting the plot! It's something about a group of teenage guys who have magical powers passed on to them through the generations. However using the powers is addictive and ages them. They're the top students in some prep school and they all watch out for each other--the leader is hunky Caleb (Steven Strait). Then a new student joins named Chase (Sebastian Stan). And evil things begin to happen...This movie deserves all the negative reviews it's gotten. The story is--to put it mildly--vague (what ARE darklings?) and the dialogue is poor. Bad direction doesn't help--director Harlin obviously has no idea on how to film a horror movie. All the scares are telegraphed and none of them work--even the stupid jump scares fall flat. The acting is (and I'm going to be nice) terrible. Caleb and the boys are the most inexpressive actors I've ever seen! Stan shows a little more life as Chase (but not much). Also this has the most deserted and dark dorms I've ever seen.There are a few positive things I can say about it--it DOES look great (dark, spooky buildings and some cool thunderstorms)and the film has as much gratuitous female AND male nudity that a PG-13 will allow. Actress Laura Ramsey has a pointless shower scene, all the boys are swimmers (so we can admire how hunky they are in black Speedos--especially Strait) and there's a fairly long sequence in the boys locker room with guys taking showers and getting dressed -- plenty of steam covers up certain areas. And yes--there's plenty of homo eroticism in this (especially the unmotivated kiss between Strait and Stan). There's a nice bit between Caleb and his girlfriend where she claims she has to go--but can't stop kissing him and the all out battle between good and evil at the end is kind of fun.So it looks good and has plenty of hot guys and girls to look at...but the confusing story, bad acting and terrible direction makes this a real chore to sit through. I can only give it a 4.",The Covenant
11,LeonLouisRicci,OK For Sensitive Teens And Easily Disturbed Old Folks,3,21 October 2012,"The kind of movie that has no graphic violence for those who hate graphic violence, no really terrifying scenes for those who hate to be terrified, PG-13 sex and nudity for those who hate that R rated sex and nudity, and so on.It has stripped itself of anything that could make this anymore than a made for regular TV-like movie for children and preteens and easily disturbed older folks. So what remains is a tepid story about generational witchcraft where modern witches do nothing supernaturally scary, and have turned into bad Marvel/DC characters who have superpowers that consist of knocking each other around and conjuring up some spiders.In the age of Harry Potter this just won't do. We have a completely inoffensive and sterile entry. It is so gentle, succulent and smooth that the wet pin-up actors are paraded like runway models smirking at the audience. The best part of the film, is the interesting looking opening credits with the song More Human Than Human from Rob Zombie. The rest is less movie than movie.",The Covenant
12,CinemaSerf,"Magic, muscles and mediocrity...",5,4 August 2020,"So imagine the scene - 4 poster boys for a wet T-shirt competition are all gifted with superpowers. They all go to school together, hang out, swim: a regular little warlock's convention - until - ""Chase"" (Sebastian Stan) arrives on the scene. He is determined to absorb their powers and become the true supermodel! Steven Strait (""Caleb"") leads our lads - Toby Hemingway, Taylor Kitsch and Chace Crawford as they must try to thwart this strategy. The snag is, their powers are highly addictive and cause premature ageing in those who abuse them - so they must use them sparingly as they fight off their powerful, new-found, nemesis who has kidnapped Laura Ramsey (""Sarah"") so as to lure boyfriend ""Caleb"" to a remote barn in the woods to have his wicked way with him.... The acting is shocking - there is one particularly risible scene with Strait ""dancing"" to Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock n' Roll"" that actually had me squirming in my seat; and the exceptionally finely choreographed duel at the end is a feat of acrobatics with all the menace of a Happy Meal.",The Covenant
13,dbborroughs,Unremarkable and forgettable,4,16 September 2006,"Renny Harlin continues his slide into ""What are you doing?"" territory with this teen retread of the old story of ""others"" living among us. Here they are age old families that have ""the power"" a mystical power thats best described as a god like power to do what ever you want. Into this mix comes an age old evil wanting to drain these special people of their power so they can rule the world.Sound familiar? It is. Its basically a fill in the blanks story done with modern movie technology that allows sequences like a car being destroyed in a collision with a log truck reconstituting itself, and battles between those with the power that would make the writers of superhero comics envious. Seemingly aimed at a teen audience the cast seems like a good five years older than they are suppose to be. Harlin, a good craftsman director with only as much creativity as a script will afford him, does what he can with what is essentially a ""teen"" drama with magic. He's given it a few great set pieces and ghastly images, but little else. Its not bad as such but its unremarkable and makes you wish that Renny Harlin would learn to pick up good scripts instead of just paychecks.Ultimately forgettable, this really isn't worth the effort.",The Covenant
14,view_and_review,The Witches of Beverly Hills 90210,3,13 January 2007,"If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: ME: ""Four boys at a private high school are good friends, AND they are witches.""Hollywood: ""That sounds like ""The Craft."" ME: ""No, no, I said four boys, not four girls."" Hollywood: ""That still sounds like ""The Craft"", just with boys instead of girls."" ME: ""OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power.""Hollywood: ""Still not much difference, because one of the girls in ""The Craft"" also wanted more power.ME: ""OK, OK... I'll make these boys part of the ""in crowd"", they'll be rich, AND the school is on the east coast.Hollywood: ""Now that sounds original. That is nothing like ""The Craft"", here's a billion dollars."" This movie was so cliché and uninspiring. Even the manufactured drama between Chase and the brothers of Ipswich was very blasé. A bunch of rich kids, with their biggest problem being what color Bentley they want for their 18th birthday (and 18th car) don't interest me at all, even if they have powers. Every single kid in this movie looked like he or she stepped out of a magazine, and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80% nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are. I wanted to rename this movie ""The Witches of O.C."". Oooh, rich kids and their problems... let me pretend to care.This film was completely unimaginative and predictable. The final fight was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anti-climatic. This was a movie best left on the cutting room floor.",The Covenant
15,neil-476,Adequate time passer,6,4 April 2010,"There's nothing major wrong with this film, but there's quite a lot that's not right.The lads in it are absolutely indistinguishable from each other. Maybe if you are a young woman it's different, but I found myself identifying two of them as ""blond"" and ""long hair."" The other three main male characters - which was which? The feel of it is never cinema feature film, it is more TV movie or, more likely, episode of TV series (either pilot or series finale or combination of both).And I never really cared about the characters very much, because I was given no reason to.",The Covenant
16,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Mostly entertaining and enjoyable,8,26 June 2015,"After transferring into a new school, a woman learns that her group of friends belong to an old family of witches hoping to protect their family's long-held powers when a similar witch arrives looking to settle a long-held dispute.This turned out to be quite a fun if slightly flawed witchcraft effort. One of it's better qualities is the rather enjoyable time this spends setting up the group and their powers, as the beginning of this features their quest for avoidance and ignorance by their arrival at the party with it's supposed escape resulting from a fine CGI-enhanced car chase through the woods. These early scenes do well to set-up the second half which offers far more overt displays of power as they begin using their supernatural powers to great effect as the onset of the different curses, the magical fixing abilities and especially the brawling which is all sorts of fun. The scenes of them flying around into numerous obstacles around the room after being hit with supernatural powers makes scenes like the battle on the highway, the fight in the bar-alley and the beat-down in the dorm-room being quite fun while letting loose with the supernatural abilities in grand style. Most impressive with this style is the barn-finale, which showcases their dynamic powers into truly fantastic action-packed spectacle scenes of their powers flying around into the situation and being a really nice fight overall. Also impressive here is the attempts at suspense which comes off really well as the supposed encounter in the bathroom and the continuous visions of the dead student around their lives there's a really healthy mix of positive points to help this one overcome the few small problematic areas in here. The biggest issue in here is based off the films' positive as the over-the-top display of their supernatural powers looks quite lame and unrealistic. Basically this just devolves into someone standing around as a series of lame CGI shock-waves come out of his body while the other one goes flying around on wires which looks utterly unrealistic and even manages to take away the horror built up through the rest of the film. The other flaw here is the toned-down feeling here as the rating really ends up holding this one from letting loose with their powers or spells which are never as gruesome or intense as they could've been to staying in check with the rating. These here are what hold this one down.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and Brief Nudity.",The Covenant
17,gradyharp,Witch Hunting in the 21st Century: Hunky Molochs!,7,3 January 2007,"THE COVENANT is not a great film by any definition but it is worth seeing for the cast of characters doomed to portray the rather shoddy script: the live Abercrombie & Fitch appearing models make up for allure in screen presence what they may lack in a solid story.In the 1600s, during the witch trials, there were five families who secretly survived, holding 'The Power', to send their descendants into the future. It is now present time and four of the families are represented by young hunks, the Ipswich Guys, who are attending a private school in autumnal Massachusetts, careful to keep their Power hidden for the most part: the Power is the ability to do fantastic feats of force and sorcery which, if it is used to much carries the punishment of aging the body quickly... The four lads are Caleb (20-year old stud model Steven Strait), Pogue (sculpted body man Taylor Kitsch), Tyler (Chace Crawford), and Reid (Toby Hemingway) and aside from Caleb and Pogue the other two are pretty much set decoration, so minimal are their lines and involvement. Into this setting comes one Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan, a handsome lad from 'The Architect') who just happens to be the surviving member of the fifth family and who is greedy for Power beyond his own abilities.A series of confrontations results in Caleb facing Chase in a showdown, but not before the girls involved with the good guys - Caleb's girlfriend Sarah (Laura Ramsey) and Pogue's girlfriend Kate (Jessica Lucas), equally as beautiful as their partners are handsome - critically enter the picture. There is, of course, a showdown in an old ancestral barn during the requisite thunder and lightning storm background which serves as a stage for the silly computer generated graphics that throw Caleb and Chase around with jellyfish balls and the like. The ending makes it very clear that a sequel (probably more than one) is planned and if that means more exposure for this attractive young cast of actors, bring it on.Director Renny Harlin and writer J.S. Cardone know they have a kitschy formula movie and seem to have a great time making it as fun and creepy as possible - good music, great lighting and camera work, and a penchant for locker room shower scenes that guarantee success with the intended audience. THE COVENANT is often silly but it is a good escapist movie and may just be the springboard for some new faces! Grady Harp",The Covenant
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Covenant,6,1 November 2006,"Don't think too much when watching this movie. That's my advice, but it worked as an excellent therapy right after surviving the horrendous local film Return to Pontianak. The Covenant is guilty pleasure, of watching something full of effects, zero storyline to think about, great looking cast and the usual fast cars and quick action.Alpha males will have another reason to rejoice, given the leading characters come from the so-called elite of the community, nicknamed ""The Sons of Ipswich"" for their founding fathers' efforts in building the town they live in. All of them are your usual good looking hunky frat boys, with fast cars, and cute chicks in tow. However, our gang of four harbour a deep secret, that each of them have supernatural powers that they can use for whatever they want, and how they want. The only catch is that with each use of their powers, they will physically age. So, do you wanna trade good looks, for absolute power?But of course, the Book of Damnation (gee) instills certain rules, and introduces the audience to hokey witchcraft and imagined mysticism. Naturally no one's interested in that stuff, except to watch with glee how our frat boys will (ab)use their powers. It's addictive, you know, having such abilities, and given the mysticism added in, it's no longer the drugs, nor the sex, nor the rock and roll that get these boys going, but the addiction of being omni- potent in place of power, wealth and fame. The leader of the pack, as per all juvenile stories, is the most powerful of the lot, and preaches time and time again on the virtues of restraint. Until one day the team faces an unexplainable disturbance in The Force (oops, wrong movie, but you get the drift), and have to discover just exactly what the disturbance is.No honours will go towards acting abilities, and I feel those in the audience with strong sense of feminism will go up in arms about how the lead female character is portrayed. You know, the one who will go weak in the knees for the hottest looking guy and literally and blatantly flings herself at him. The guys too fare no better, always trying to ooze machismo and drip testosterone at every opportunity, and enjoy replicating Underworld-styled leaping off rooftops.For a movie like this, there are no efforts spared in jazzing up the special effects. While on the whole it's all good, there are portions of it which made scenes look like extended screen versions of the video game Street Fighter, and taking a leaf too from Asia's StormRiders (Feng Yun) in creating battle scenes. You know it's time for formula, when fights are choreographed according to an alternative rock soundtrack. While the action is good, the pacing of the movie could be improved loads. It couldn't decide whether it wanted to be mysterious, horrific, reliant on action or wanting to take its romantic bits seriously. It seemed that director Renny Harlin had a lot of ideas for the feel of the movie, but couldn't decide which to put focus on, and in the end, threw everything into the pot for a mix.It's like an all boys ""The Craft"", also set in school, except that their powers are inherited, and the story examines what's it like to use power with a price. If you need something to immerse yourself to forget about a hard day's work, then The Covenant probably is your choice. Oh, and this is one movie in which the trailer tells the whole damn story.",The Covenant
19,siderite,Witches Club with boys and not a very good movie,5,2 October 2006,"I rate this movie as a failure. It felt like the pilot of a failed TV show, like the first episode from Charmed or something. Basically you have the four descendants of witch families, old money, living in the US, having amazing powers and using them stupidly while trying to convince us they are hiding them. Another witch guy (warlock?) appears and does battle with the most macho guy in the group and loses. The end.No, I mean it, the other three guys have no relevant roles, they just look good in the men's locker room and pretend to be as cool as the main guy. I actually couldn't believe it. It sucked completely.The movie is well done cinematically, but as a script and feel it is plain disappointing. Even the battle with liquid 3D blobs of magical energy is pathetic.",The Covenant
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,See? This is why The Craft was made with girls! Boys just ruin everything!,3,6 January 2007,"I had no interest after viewing the theatrical trailer, the movie looked so lame, but my friend rented the movie and said it was decent, so I figured maybe I should take a look and see what it was about before I make any judgments, guess what? My judgments were totally right! You remember the movie The Craft? Do remember how the effects were very real looking and so cool to look at? Well, the effects are completely obvious and more annoying, not to mention the acting was just plain horrible.These boys are part of an old covenant that goes back generations to their ancestors. One of them is about to ""ascend"", I assume that means more power, for boys that's a bad thing, believe me since they are using their powers to look up girl's skirts. Well, guess what? One of the boys is jealous of the main guy, Caleb, since he's going to ascend before him. To get to Caleb he will use Caleb's girlfriend to give him all the powers that he possesses, oh, boys will be boys, you know? The plot made no sense, nor do I think you would want to understand it. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one with sense on IMDb to see that this movie definitely needed more work, it could have had some potential, maybe as a sequel to The Craft, but I guess that would've ruined it, right? Just stick to The Craft, believe me when I say you'll thank me, stay away from The Convenant.3/10",The Covenant
21,DKosty123,Very Familiar Formula Film,5,24 September 2006,"This film is actually quite pleasant as it has an easy to follow plot, some good rock music, some good photographic work, good special effects, & a group young relatively unknown cast members who can act OK. This film is a pleasant diversion for an dull afternoon when you want to see a movie. If there are problems, it is the fact that the film does not really break any new ground. The plot has been done in anywhere near 100 movies of this type. Teenage boys should like the sequences showing well built actresses in fairly undressed stages including a shower scene which does not measure up to the most famous shower scene in Psycho (by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of the suspense medium). Yes, the film tries to achieve suspense & is well filmed. While it will does not measure up to the best films of this type, if any one of the young cast makes it big in the future, this film will be pulled out & run to get interest in where this person got started, much like Suzanne Sommers got a lot of notice for 10 seconds in American GRAFFITI. The film is like old fashioned Hollywood in that the good triumphs over the evil & at the end, the main male & female leads drive off in his car.There are some references to an early time & religion in the US which almost would interest a history buff. Trouble is there is very little specific information. The main landmark which gets used at the end is this eerie old barn which finally does serve as the back drop for the films finale. The subject is witchcraft, and one of the characters makes a remark about Harry Potter early on in the film. Other than that, the film will not look as dated as those of 20 years ago for a while as the characters all have cell phones. I have seen much worse films than this effort, but also much better ones.",The Covenant

23,Robert_duder,An episode of 'Passions' that might have fared well on the WB,5,10 September 2006,"The Covenant in some ways turned out to be what I expected. I think that I must say that Renny Harlin had NO business trying his hand a teen horror flick. I mean the man can director horror, he did excellent with the fourth installment of the Nightmare On Elm Street Series, and The Exorcist: The Beginning, and he knows action inside and out given Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2 but Harlin has a certain degree of campy cheap film making to him. He seems to consistently aim for the best route to make people want to see his films even if it means not going out on a limb, being completely stereotypical and rehashing material. The Covenant blatantly crammed in hot young actors, scenes of nudity both male and female, teenage romance, and special effects and didn't even try to utilize any of it with class or talent. If anyone has seen the horrendously acted and written Daytime Soap Passions...this reeked of one of their ""witchcraft"" story lines with acting that is best left on Soaps and felt like an episode of a WB pilot (by the way I do like the WB and they have given some of my favorite shows BUT that doesn't mean it belongs on the big screen.) Fairly newcomer Steven Strait plays the lead Witch of a group of four descendants of some powerful witches. Strait is decent in the lead role and has a certain intensity about him and if anyone gives a redeemable performance in a shameless teen romp horror film it would be him. Also a relative newcomer Sebastian Stan plays his adversary Chase Collins who is the bastard son of one of the witch descendants and therefore was never taught to control his powers. Now here lies one of the major problems. Stan and Strait look an awful lot alike in this film and it is often hard in a mish mash script to tell them apart. At one point Stan even morphs into Strait which only confuses matters more and when they have their final battle it's nearly impossible to tell who is who. Stan's performance is campy and overblown and he doesn't come across as evil or twisted but more annoying than anything else. Laura Ramsey plays Strait's love interest Sarah. She is strictly meant to be eye candy spending nearly a 15 minute scene padding around in a towel or in the shower. Her role is vapid and almost pointless if not for the decent romance between her and Strait's character. She has done far better work than this performance. Taylor Kitsch is one of the other more redeemable roles in the film as good guy witch Pogue Parry. He actually shows some emotion and depth and then sadly they put him in a coma for the last and best part of the film. But when he was awake he had character and strength and would have rather seen him do something in the end. Toby Hemingway plays good/bad boy witch Reid Garwin, and I thought his character was going to be interesting since they try and paint him out as being the black sheep but he performs so poorly that his character is almost pointless. He's emotionless and straight faced. Jessica Lucas plays Kitsch's love interest and although she doesn't have a big part she does alright with what's given to her.Screenplay writer for this one was J.S. Cardone and I must say his filmography reads like a who's who of low budget straight to video crap from what I've seen of it. His screenplay combined with Harlin's directing made for what seemed like nothing but an attempt to cash in one teens going to the movies. It was like they sat down and said alright let's throw together a little film and put in it what will make people go see it. There is hardly any redeemable content to this film. It wasn't miserable to watch but it was almost boring and unnecessary and confusing. It was like they tried to put some complexity in a story that didn't deserve it. There is NOTHING wrong with teen horror flicks or teen movies in general...some of them are great!! But this one was done by the wrong people in the wrong way with the WRONG script. I will say that the final 20 minutes when the battle takes place it has some cool special effects and it's a sigh of relief to finally get some action in a dreary movie where the cast is not strong enough to make it interesting. Despite some decent special effects in the end...the payout doesn't fit the journey you have to go through to get there. Skip this one until it's one TV where it belongs. 5/10",The Covenant
24,MLDinTN,male version of the Craft,5,29 July 2007,"This movie was fair. Four guys have ""witch"" powers. The first to turn 18 is the first to ascend, meaning he has the strongest powers. We are introduced to two new students at the school. One is a girl, who makes a hot girlfriend for the leader, Caleb. Then there is Chase who seems very interested in hanging out with the group of four. The beginning tells of 5 witch families, but one family's descendants had all died or so we think. That part pretty much gives away as to who Chase really is.The special effects were OK at times. I didn't know that witches used energy balls to combat. I thought that final fight scene with all the energy blasts was sort of comical.FINAL VERDICT: Not really anything new. The unknown actors were kind of hot, but other than that, I see no reason to watch this.",The Covenant

The Covenant doesn't have the top notch writing but it sure is entertaining and that's good enough for me in a lot of cases.

26,paulclaassen,Mostly for teenagers.,5,10 August 2021,"I have to say, I loved the opening sequence! Really cool!'The Covenant' feels a bit immature at times. It feels like a teenage movie and as such might appeal best to the teenage demographic. The acting wasn't all that great, and the romance between our hero, Caleb, and mortal girl, Sarah, starts way too soon. Then again, this is probably how teenagers do it... It's lust, not love - big difference... It also wasn't always clear what the story was actually about, except for the fifth generation guy, Chase, wanting more power. Also, regarding the four friends with powers, they might has well have been only three, as the fourth character was forgettable and hardly contributed to anything on screen - or to the story for that matter.On a positive note, the eye candy was dee-licious! Ripped young bodies... The visual effects were also really good, especially during the finale. I also enjoyed the sense of mystery. In general - despite the aforementioned flaws - 'The Covenant' is an enjoyable fantasy thriller. Switch off the brain cells, sit back, and enjoy the ride. This was entertaining.",The Covenant

28,GOWBTW,"Reminds of the ""The Craft"", only for dudes!",8,11 September 2006,"10 years ago the was a movie called ""The Craft"" now there's this supernatural movie that takes place in Massachusettes. That's the place know for the witch-hunts. Here you have four young men who have great powers, and they want to go to the extreme with it. I mean jumping off a cliff is child's play to them, driving the Hummer over the cliff is wild, then landing right behind the police is crazy. At least they didn't land on the cruiser. And the scene I really like is when one of the friends encounters a darkling in his car, and he gets involved in a head on collision with a semi. Then all of a sudden, the car is in one piece again. To me, that was freaky, yet, it was amazing as well. And the girls in the movie are hot. Even though the movie rating is PG-13, the scenes are quite subtle. The girls sleepwear wasn't that bad, and the shower scenes were mild. The only scary part was the wraith that was stalking the hot girl. The special effects in the movie top ""The Craft"" big time. Powers can be a gift and a curse at the same time. The gift is always a blessing when used properly, the curse is the case cause by the misuse of it. ""The Covenant"" is a surpassing improvement form the ""The Craft"", and I kinda like it better as well. To me, I smell a sequel! Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",The Covenant
29,FiendishDramaturgy,"Typically, I'm in the Minority Again. I LOVE This Movie!",9,8 December 2007,"Okay, so it's a male version of the Craft...kinda. Yes, I'd have to agree with that summation; however, this features MUCH more story, more meat, more history, and a FAR better execution than the Craft. It also presents a much better developed story, characters, and production style.This is dark, yet shines throughout. It is witty without being stupid. It is serious without taking itself too seriously. It is entertaining without losing sight of the fact that its audience wants to be uplifted by their entertainment.This work features some innovatively creative elements, great performances, and strong dialog combined with historically based characters, enlightened direction, and an incredibly slick production style that does not lose itself in its...slickness. *L* I really enjoy this, and have the extended edition in my DVD collection.All in all? It's not good for the kiddies. It tends to be a bit harsh in places, but falls well within the PG-13 rating it receives. Billed as ""horror,"" this work is more ""thriller,"" in my opinion.

30,BeneCumb,"Rather weak, with too many clichés",4,11 September 2012,"The result is pretty annoying as someone got the idea to combine a teen movie and a vampire-type mystery.

Thus, it is strange that showing muscular male torsos, smooth female legs, kisses in the rain / during lightning, nervous relationships, college competition etc, on the one hand, and flying in the air, insects in bodies and in dreams, aged youth, flashing eyes etc, on the other hand, could create a good entertainment. The scenes are stupid at times and no actor is interesting to watch, it seems they were picked thanks to their model-like appearance.Renny Harlin has made stuff of different quality, but this could have been avoided.

The power to do whatever your hearts desire. Three of the young men like to use the power for there personal game, except for Caleb who doesn't like to abuse his power. But now a certain someone has come to take it all away, and try to tear them apart.

Who wants their power to make himself stronger.Directed by Renny Harlin (Exorcist:The Beginning, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master, Die Hard 2:Die Harder) made an interesting, supernatural thriller.

This movie did OK at the box office but it will certainly find life on DVD.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an amusing commentary track by the director. DVD also includes:behind the scenes featurette and previews. Despite being set at the young crowd. The picture is also enjoyable for the adults, who will see this film as a guilty pleasure. Once of the highlights of this is the good looking cinematography by Pierre Gill (The Art of War). It has some ambitious CGI effects. The film does gets cheesy and silly towards the conclusion but nonetheless for entertainment is fun. Written by J.S. Cardone (The Forsaken).

This is what you call ""overdetermined.' Every decision its creators make, underscores the last one. Varying from anyone of those 6 privileges was it's only chance to make a somewhat more interesting plot, and most writers know this.Not here. Each scene is no more than another chance to underscore which of those privileges we're going to fantasize about until the next scene arrives in 4 minutes.

But it is a so bad it's good film with really bad and really good parts. It also helps the film that it features the most beautiful guys grouped into a movie scantily clad in some wonderfully revealing scenes (locker room, swim practice) that has ever been created. So the premise is this there are four hot guys led by Caleb Danvers played by hot as hell Steven Strait who inherited powers from their magical bloodline at the age of 13. They can do pretty much whatever they want but the only problem is. It ages them. And the magic is addictive. They are descendants from the four original families that pilgrimed the area in which the film takes place. But there was a fifth and it's long lost descendant has returned. Chase Collins played by drool inducing Sebastian Stan. And he wants revenge for his family line being kicked out of the covenant, or something like that. But here's the kicker when they reach the age of 18 they ascend and inherit even more power, power that Chase wants to steal from Caleb. Aha and there's the plot despite a tacky little romance with under actress Laura Ramsey of Venom and She's the Man. Look I know they could've done something really cool with the premise. Like an adult Harry Potter type thing. But this film is trash. It knows it's trash and it indulges in the fun of it. From the alluring and seductive camera angles which trace their rock hard abs and tiny speedos to the cgi protoplasm fighting sequences and even to the tacky thrown in scares the film just works. It works as a craft for boys, or a lost boys starring abercombie models. the acting is not especially good it ranges from mediocre to awful with some sordid dialogue like my little wiatch to Little miss Moffet and bad music score choices. But in addition to that it also has some good dialogue, interesting plot revelations and good musical choices(especially during the final battle). The final battle isn't all it's cracked up to be. But the film is stylish and is exactly what it promises to be. There is magic. There are hot boys. There are hot boys pretty much naked. There is a hot girl. There is action and there are scares. It's not fully satisfying as a good film but despite the scene where Laura Ramsey's character puts a quarter into the jukebox and jams to I love Rock' N"" roll the film is watchable and quite entertaining.

This pitiful excuse for a film was made for one reason and one reason only - To show off the bodies of several young men who obviously need to spend less time at the gym and more time investing in acting lessons. None of the these guys have any business being in front of a camera and their amateur acting is very embarrassing. The ""plot"" isn't even worth getting into, as it's basically a male version of THE CRAFT minus that films attention to character, good acting, insightful dialogue and interesting premise.

And four of these similarly dressed guys standing together won't make you think they are a force to reckoned with, they make you think ""Backstreet Boys album cover."" Just when you think it can't get any sillier, out come a few guys in low-cut black lycra swimsuits in a utterly laughable attempt to convince you these guys have a dark side. Other things that try to give this a dark feel are the look and sound. Sadly, the steely gray-blue cinematography is overused and unimaginative. And the soundtrack choices, a bunch of mainstream metal about as heavy and edgy as Creed, fail to inject the intended dark tone.The highlight of the entire movie was the hilarious fake CGI ""steam"" during the shower room scene, which is done less for artistic value and more for the fact that showing a willy would threaten the inevitable PG-13 rating.If you want to rent THE COVENANT and make an evening of it, get THE ELEPHANT MAN so you can see how the other half lives.

The constant ""boo"" scares got very annoying after awhile and the Dragonball Z style of fighting bored me as well.I don't really want to go on about how bad this movie is, if you really want to, see it for yourself. Otherwise, save yourself the bother and read a book, any book, as it would make you smarter than watching this 90 minute pile of crap.1/5",The Covenant

When I saw the trailer, it looked like it would be a decent movie, bunch of people with powers killing each other or whatnot. Instead, I get what appears to be those overly preppy guys in chick flicks playing with witchcraft. First of all, all of them were preppy as hell, spoiled, and stupid. They all had friggin mustangs and preppy clothes and whatnot. Also they used their powers to be popular more than to help anyone. The storyline itself sucked...why would they all happen to be descendents from original families and still have the same last names and stuff...and not have any brothers or sisters? I don't get it. They bad guy was a kid who they were friends with, and he was a kinda shy person but once they find out hes evil he turns into a classic, overly sadistic asshole type of villain you'd see in 40's movies. Their names themselves sucked, who'd name their kid ""Pogue"" or ""Reid""? A prep thats who. Coulda been so good but wasn't. 3/10",The Covenant

One review made me laugh "" If anyone rates this over 3 has no taste in movies"". My reply is who the hell are U, Leonard Maltin? First this film is not to be taken seriously, so lighten up. Well I know movies and try to find something positive about every film I see; even if it SUX.The Covenant is about four popular guys who attend Spencer Academy. An exclusive prep school located in Ipswich, Massachusetts. The Four are; Caleb Danvers( Steven Straight), Pogue Parry( Taylor Kitch), Reid Garwin( Toby Hemingway)and Tyler Simms( Chance Crawford). Caleb is the leader, They are also know as The Sons Of Ipswich. They got there name, because of the closeness of each family and their wealth. The fifth son was supposedly killed off according to Kate(Jeccica Lucas) a student at Spencer. Caleb is dating Sarah (Laura Ramsey) Kate's roommate. Sarah is fascinated by the towns history, witch trails were held there back in the 17th century. One famous trial was that of John Putnam, who had an illegitimate son. He was also know for casting various spells with spiders.
When a new student, Chase Collins(Sebastain Stan) arrives at Spenser Academy, the group befriends him at first. Then strange things begin to happen. First a student from Spencer is found dead of an apparent suicide. Then Sarah has a dream about millions of spiders crawling on her; and her roommate. During swim practice Caleb and Chase, are racing against each other in a freestyle event. In the pool Caleb notices Chase's eyes turn completely black. Chase ends up beating him, and causing Caleb to hit his head on the pool. Caleb tells the others what happened, but they think he is just mad because he was beat. Then when Chases ID was found in the dead students car, the four want to know more.That night Caleb and Pogue break into The Admissions office, and find his file. They find out his real name is Chase Putnam, not Collins and his adoptive parents were killed in a car accident when he turned 18. when the other two get the information they realize he is the fifth Son of Ipswich. Banished because he is the illegitimate son of John Putnam. Chase has returned for revenge by stealing their powers, and casting a dangerous spell on Kate sending her to the hospital. He vows to kill anyone who gets in his way, his next target is Caleb's girlfriend, Sarah. Caleb fearing for his life and Sarah's, tells her who he really his. He explains the process of his powers and at 18-when one ascends the power grows. Some can handle it and some can't causing a rapid aging process. He tells Sarah to go with Pogue and Tyler to the dance, because at 11:12 he will ascend. He wants Sarah to be safe, because he is to meet Chase and the Putnam barn. When he arrives Chase is already there and has Sarah under a spell. In order to save her he and Chase battle to the death. Since Chase is older he is more powerful than Caleb. the two start to battle, chase notices that Caleb starts to ascend. The two continue to battle back and fourth. Then Caleb starts to receive his father's help, getting the better of Chase and ending his reign of terror.
This film has the eye candy for all the teens to enjoy, a simple plot, with minor cussing. Despite having actors not known to me it is still a good film about Warlocks. This also stars Kyle Schmidt as Aaron, who is the tough guy , trouble maker of the school. If you like The Craft; you should enjoy The Covenant. So it's not a blockbuster, enjoy it for what it is A Cool Flick.",The Covenant
51,PoisonKeyblade,Impossible not to LOVE this movie,10,17 August 2007,"The Covenant is the best movie about witchcraft to date, only this time it centers around a group of hot young guys. This film is good not just because of all the hot young acting talent to look at, but also because it has a very good story. The directing and the special effects are very well done, and The Covenant even manages to top the superb The Craft. The acting is very good by all of the leads, most notably the young Steven Strait, who displays an unseen vibe on screen and just oozes with potential. There are very few scares, but when they come they work quickly and effectively. One of the best movies of 2006, and extremely watchable if not just for Steven Strait alone.",The Covenant
52,Quicksand,Whatever,5,10 January 2007,"In the DVD's lone extra, a few of the cast are heard commenting on how the film is shot really creatively, with unique angles and a distinct visual flair. This is true. This is also really all the movie has going for it.Remember ""The Quick and the Dead?"" Early 1990's, directed by Sam Raimi. What we got here is a ""Quick and the Dead"" situation: name director takes random script out of the pile, and creates a movie that's really style over substance. Except Raimi had a fantastic cast that would later all be famous... Renny Harlin, director of ""Cutthroat Island"" and ""Mindhunters"" hires a cast of pretty-boy, medium-talent no-names who couldn't even land a guest-spot on ""Everwood."" Sure, they all have different hairstyles, but I still can't tell them apart. No one bothered to make me care.The movie starts in the middle, and the first 30 minutes are spent developing a character who becomes background noise for the last hour. The special effects are nifty, the love interest is lovely, and the four male leads are all easy on the eyes, or so I'm told. This is a good double feature at a slumber party with ""The Craft"" but is rated PG-13 and isn't really meant for anyone much older than that. It's also the nail in the coffin of Renny Harlin's career. Good riddance.Screenwriter J.S. Cardone has a long IMDb filmography of straight-to-video movies. Renny Harlin was enough of a name to get this a budget and a theatrical release, but it didn't deserve it. 5/10.",The Covenant
53,AndyVanScoyoc,Great movie and one not to be missed!,10,11 September 2006,"I went to see this movie Friday night, which was opening night.I wasn't sure what to expect. I have gotten my hopes up over many ""good"" (at least by some standards,) horror/dark/fantasy movies and most of them let me down. I like Steven Strait (Caleb Danvers) and thought he was great in Sky High so I was curious as to what kind of performance he would put out for this movie.I was hoping that he would continue his ""bad boy"" image in Covenant as he did in Sky High and not come off wooden or over acted.I was not disappointed in his performance.From the get-go this movie was slick, hip and believable! I was in shock. I like witch/warlock (whatever you prefer to call them) movies and saw The Craft when it came out. I was not only disappointed, I laughed at it. It was very High Schoolish.I wasn't charmed by the television show Charmed either. Now, don't get me wrong, I kind of like Charmed, it had its good moments, but it's not like you will see me president of their fan club.The Covenant takes this style of movie to a whole 'nother level with a fresh and believable (yes I keep using that word a lot but it fits) twist that first blasts movies like The Craft and then shows them how it should be done. With situations and a sense of something foreboding but that the characters are ready to tackle because they know they have to, this movie reaches a new level of ""teen/young adult"" movie.There is little drama and certainly no ""it's all about me"" attitudes (like was very visible at times in Charmed) and these young men, while proving that boys will be boys are still up for the challenge.The thing that impressed me the most about this movie was that there were no asinine boob shots or unnecessary nudity to get people to watch. The men in the shower scene were a different (and nice from a woman's stand point for certain) touch. If Renny Harlin wanted to, he could have done what most other movie makers would have done in order to gain the most viewershad a shower scene with naked women with huge breasts running about, jiggling in all manner of places and on each other.Kudos to Renny for being daring, if nothing else, in a world where a movie, unless it has lots of naked female butts and boobs, more than likely won't be watched.I guess at least Renny knows that women like movies like this too and that we get tired of seeing butt and boob shots when we can look at our own if we wish.The scenery in this movie was absolutely stunning. Mental note...visit Quebec in the Fall with a stop by Nova Scotia as well.The casting of Steven Strait in this movie was about as good as they could have gotten. He was cool, handsome, believable, and likable. I honestly cannot think of anyone better to have played the part of the mature, level headed and intense, Caleb Danvers.I found the entire cast great and am pleased to see that Renny Harlin continues to prove what a great director he is.I would highly recommend this movie.",The Covenant
54,Thrashman88,"The potential to be HUGE, but eventually not.",6,26 October 2007,"THE COVENANT is an entertaining yet unfulfilled story of 4 descendants of witch families living in todays world as normal high school kids. To keep their identities safe from the rest of the world, they form a secret society or ""covenant"". They must use their witch powers wisely or else they will be consume by them and make them age quickly. This group of young witches is suddenly threatened by an unknown fifth member, who wants to steal their powers.An interesting variant on witch mythology with some nice scary moments and even, some decent performances by the mostly unknown cast of young actors. It's the story that lends itself to far greater things. So many things could've made this movie a huge blockbuster, but the story is just the exposition of what seems to be another movie franchise. Despite all the effects and little suspense, the movie ends as flat, insinuating a possible sequel.Good for viewing on a rainy Sunday afternoon.",The Covenant
55,revival05,"Hm. Hm. OK... OK.... riiight.... wh...what was.... no OK.... oh he said ""wiatch"" that was pretty fun, oh ho-hum, yadayada, right. What was it I just watched?",4,10 May 2008,"I feel sorry for Renny Harlin. I really do. In my mind, there is no doubt of his talent. Despite being hired for his craftsmanship, rather than any kind of unique vision, he has always been an action-auteur to me. Naturally, I wouldn't compare him with John Huston or James Cameron or someone like that, not for a long shot, but it has been shown what he can do once he has a good screenplay in his hand. DIE HARD 2 and LONG KISS GOODNIGHT are two of the very finest action pictures of the 1990's and despite being brainless and stupid, both CLIFFHANGER and DEEP BLUE SEA are tightly shot and easily entertaining. I also think it was a great achievement to come back to business fairly strong after having to deal with such a monster flop as CUTTHROAT ISLAND. But any Lazarus, Mr. Harlin ain't. After DRIVEN you could figure the rest of his story out.THE COVENANT is a chapter in the rest of that story. This is one of those movies that inexplicably rushes towards the ending from the very beginning, forgetting to tell a story on the way. The exposition is painfully underexposed. All I could see while watching this film was a couple of clone-like young models/actors running around shouting at each other, occasionally having a ""magic"" fight, and discussing like they have this massive problem on their hands because of this very serious thingy going on in this world where they are totally aware of every little rule. But I'm not following. In the beginning somebody shouts ""Harry Potter can kiss my ass"". But apparently they aren't wizards? Magicians? They inherit some kind of power, I get that, but where did that power come from? Did their ancestors discover it? Is it a force of nature? What does it mean if you get a ""spell""? Are we talking no-nonsense-death? And what's the difference between the ""normal"" powers and the so called ""ascended"" (sic) powers? In what way is the final battle so much more powerful than any other in the film? And if you've got super powers like that, why is it necessary to rescue a girl from a burning building? What about ""magically"" putting the fire out? Or are the powers insufficient? In that case, why?YOU KNOW WHAT! I don't think I am supposed to be having to ask these questions!! It is just a vague premise that could have made sense, had we gotten more exposition and background info than the one little scene in the beginning of the film. A film with fantasy elements need to make us understand the rules of it's world, otherwise it's utterly pointless.Though it's the biggest problem, that's not my only complaint. It doesn't happen anything in this movie! I get these characters and all of a sudden I am supposed to care about them and the tone is all very dramatic, but where do these people ever utter one line that refers to them as interesting, individual characters? Nowhere. It's just a couple of guys who are all the same, running around with spells and ""powers"" and a villain equally identical putting girls they barely know in peril as if it's more important than the end of the world. Or, I don't know if the villain wanted to rule the world I just kinda assumed.No I'll just stop there. This is a film that presents nothing, develops nothing, sets up nothing, tie together nothing and end on a big nothing. As for trying to be optimistic, Harlin has shot and cut this film professionally and it's at least not ugly. The style is reminiscent of TV shows like BUFFY or CHARMED, sorta, so I guess this film can find it's teen audience somewhere and if they like it, I guess it's done it's job (not a very hard one). It's not entirely in tune with my taste, specially not all this crap music being spewed out across the soundtrack, but I understand who the target audiences are supposed to be.All I can think of though, is that I really feel sorry for Renny Harlin.",The Covenant
56,kooleshwar,A decent B-movie .............,7,22 January 2007,"I don't get it every B-movie that I've seen on this site has nothing above six, as its rating if people don't like B-movies they have no business going for them and then taking the movie to the cleaners.I went for this movie because I like the preview, and fully knowing that this is in fact a B-movie (its not really that hard you know when you can hardly see a face you recognise or names you've heard),and I entered my movie fully aware that I cannot expect the same quality that you normally expect from A-list movies.The movie starts like a typical teen movie and ends just like one. From the beginning to end you get the feeling that this movie has been made with a set recipe in mind.I can theorise what the recipe was was...1) A bunch of buff teen guys (BREAD)(for the ladies, acting talent not an issue) mixed with a couple of teen girls (MEAT) (pretty hot and demographically correct with the mandatory black character, could have done with a few more of those could have distracted us from other shortcomings also honestly I think more guys watch B-movies than girls).2)Add some unstable mystery (SEASONING?ive heard there is some)(seeing the preview will ruin this), mix it with some half baked horror scenes (MAYO YUMM) that are only an excuse to show the semi-nude bodies of the hot chicks( I'm not complaining though, don't want to rant on the ratings again, I guess its OK to show see through clothing and nude women though clouded glass to children below 13 if their with adults haha).3)Since most guys love extra mayo we have some more necessary (or unnecessary) exposure with women chatting in nighties all the time.4)Add a bit of zing and aura (pickles you never really know what it is its just PICKLE), now this the best part of the movie, the movie purposefully keeps the origin of THE POWER a mystery and doesn't offer to much explanation on the events that shape the movie, or will shape the future ones (there are always sequels aren't there).5)And finally the CHEESE and boy is there lots of it, some GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS (especially the car crash scene), some decent action scenes, and some dialogue that often crosses the line into corny territory. Honestly though which guy wouldn't want THE POWER and the fun and the wealth that comes with it.So finally you have a movie that can be pretty much compared to a burger at McDonalds, you don't get gourmet but for a decent price (I watched at cheaper rates off-course matinée is ideal),you get a decent burger with extra mayo and extra cheese that is bound to satisfy especially when you hungry (bored in this case).The movie did have potential though and could have easily had some better action scenes considering the limitless potential with magic involved (more violence as long as children are with parents) and some more chicks and side stories effectively distracting us from standard B-movie weaknesses (weak script, dialogues).In all a Decent B-movie that can be watched at cheaper rates if your bored, or if you borrow the DVD (not rent), TV will not work as there isn't enough content to hold you attention especially in the second half.-s wasted potential, not enough chicks, action scenes were so-so.+/-s really as B-movies go there have been better.+s hot chicks some decent exposure (considering the rating), decent aura created, good special effects and cinematography, gives some good scope for fantasizing.total 7/10 (obviously factoring in B-movie criteria, also after seeing the preview I expected more so I recommend you don't see it which will actually leave an element of mystery in the movie).",The Covenant
57,freaky_dave,Uh. No.,4,18 September 2006,"The Convenant was not the worse movie I've seen this year, but it was far from being one of the best.Where to start. The acting for the most part, with the exception of the lead actor Steven Strait, was pretty bad. It doesn't help that much of the dialoque was rather lame and poor as well. It's no surprise though that these actors and actresses were chosen for the part for their looks and not their talent.I liked the idea, but it's too bad not much was done with the story. I would've liked to know more about how the powers came to be. More history into the magic would've been welcomed.The special effects weren't the greatest, but their were some scenes that were interesting, especially the scenes involving spiders. Other scenes that came straight out of Underworld were also interesting, which is no surprise since many of the people involved with Underworld were also involved with this movie.The final battle scene was all right, but it could've been better. But then the movie's budget was only 20 million dollars, so I guess I can't really complain. It could've been a lot worse.Overall the movie had some good moments, but it had a lot of bad ones as well. When you have a movie involving five teenagers with special powers, it would've been nice to have been interested in all of them and not just the lead actor, who as I said above is the only one who showed any acting ability. The movie reminded me a lot of 1987s The Lost Boys, except these teenagers are witches and not vampires, but The Lost Boys was the better movie, with a much more interesting story and better acting.",The Covenant

Harlin plops his generically attractive, completely forgettable cast of teens into a creepy, under-lit, over-fogged setting to make the action extra-mystical, then forgets to deliver enough of that action to justify the set-up. Perhaps he spent too much on the locations, running out of cash for the f/x and stunts. Also, by keeping the sex and sorcery within PG-13 boundaries, he undermined whatever head-start Halloween kicks this premise might have delivered. Too many minutes; too little mayhem.The curse of Cutthroat Island continues...",The Covenant
60,Jakealope,"Good Concept, But Poor Writing and Teen Pandering Makes It Tiring",5,28 September 2006,"The movie has a good concept: that a bunch of warlocks inherit magic powers from their fathers, but only the first born son, in a place on the North Shore of Massachussets(really Canada) near Salem, or Ipswich. There are five families possessing this power, the Ipswich 5. This has been going on from the 1600's, They are neither good or evil, but now are just a bunch of rowdy teenagers. But to use their powers burns them out and they age too quickly if they abuse the power. Then throw in the old prep school for the transatlantic Harry Potter scenario and you have a good vehicle for drama and efx, hopefully.Here are my issues with the movie:These are supposed to be old blue blood WASPy folks, but the kids look and dress like from Beverley Hills 90201. The prep school was all rich decadent party types, total stereotypes. These warlocks would probably be outcasts or loners, but instead they are the toast of the school and town. You'd think after 350 years, the locals might have gotten wary of the 5 witch families, whether they were malevolent or not.Then throw in an opening scene lifted right out of ""Lost Boys"", where the warlocks jump off of a cliff to a beach party. Then they get into this chase scene with the local cops in their Hummer in the woods and the beach, and the kids make the car fly, wow! That could have been a GM commercial, only total dicks drive Hummer H2s in my book.Another howler, and a sop for the mental midget crowd, was the shower scene involving a phantasm and the cute female starlet, Laura Ramsey as Sarah Wenham, the cute new blond in the school. All I saw was another Psycho scenario with near naked breasts.Steven Strait, as Caleb Danvers, is the alpha teenager in the Ipswich 5, and the most powerful witch of them all. His father is a living corpse at age 44 because of his excesses with power but Caleb tries to control his power and get the other brats too do the same so they don't burn out, when they aren't making Hummers fly. He tries to invokes introspection into his character, but his hairdoo gets into the way. His mother, the rich reclusive drunk in the big old house, is Wendy Crewson who is decent. Most of the actors are young Canadian unknowns, but they did their best with such a lame script.I don't want to give more away, but a long lost witch returns to get even with the five families. He is another smarmy rich kid transferring from Boston Public. Renny Harlin shows that he is all style, the wrong one, and no substance. A simple down home style in his technique, sets and dress would have been more congruent with the script, not his pulse pounding action movie technique. With some intelligent plotting and dialog, they could have had an anti-Harry Potter movie that was fun to watch. But they sure left themselves open to sequels with the last scene, though, even in these days when the ""Omen"" gets remade, ain't happening too soon.",The Covenant
61,oshram-3,Better than you would expect,6,11 September 2006,"The Covenant just goes to show that every once in a while you should take a chance on a movie you know almost nothing about. While it's isn't Shakespeare, it is a fairly well-done horror movie that doesn't rely on gore or shlock to work its 'magic.' The story follows four boys who are descended from families from the colony of Ipswich, Mass; they are the eldest son of the eldest son blah blah blah and they have inherited dark magical powers from their ancestors (who apparently were the only survivors of the Salem witch trials). The movie comes right out at the start and pretty much tells you just to accept the powers, that they aren't going to be explained, but you know, I'd rather have that than finding out it's all just a bunch of benevolent bacteria or something equally inane. Anyway, the boys are: the serious, responsible one, Caleb (Steven Strait), his slightly edgy best friend Pogue (Taylor Kitsch, looking for all the world like 7th Heaven's Barry Watson, even down to the hair), the guy who shows off with his powers, Reid (Toby Hemmingway), and a fourth guy who is sketched so briefly and says so little he's barely there at all.Most of the movie is split between the budding romance between Caleb and new girl Sarah (Laura Ramsey), and the more interesting plot line that someone is mucking with dark magic and playing with Caleb and company -- evil dreams, visions of dead people, the whole nine yards. But the movie exceeds expectations because none of these things are painfully overexplained. You see an apparition in a car and Caleb refers to it as a darkling, and you get it. No need to two minutes of explaining how a darkling is created or what it is (with no offense intended to Rupert Giles or Hermione Granger); you're given just enough information to keep the story moving, and surprisingly, it works very well.Again, it's not great film-making, and while most of the unknowns are adequate, the acting rarely rises above most horror movies. But the intelligent way in which the world is revealed to us, along with a blessedly logical approach to the magical power and its use (not to mention, honestly, some cool graphics) make The Covenant more than just a bunch of pretty guys walking around with their shirts open (which they do a lot considering it's fall in Massachusetts). Building on this decent foundation is the movie's unwillingness to go too far or take it over the top; even one of the biggest fright moments in the film is portrayed effectively by an army of spiders. The movie never bows to excessive gore or grossness (given that it's PG-13, that's not a surprise), but maybe more horror films could take a cue from a movie that's more interested in a good story and some psychological horror rather than scene after scene or bloody dismemberment.If you're not a horror fan, it's doubtful The Covenant would convert you. But I'm not, really, and I enjoyed this film. It's a well-done popcorn flick, maybe, but still worth your time to see if you have even the slightest interest in the occult genre.",The Covenant

A small group of hunky students at an exclusive boarding school have supernatural powers. They are descendants of some of the witches who survived the Salem witch trials. They are menaced by a fellow young (and good-looking) warlock who has evil intentions. Some pretty, waifish girlfriends of theirs get partially caught up in it. You won't have any trouble figuring out what happens before it happens, as it's all been done before. But it's easy to watch. The dark visual style is proper and there's some fairly nice New England scenery. The special effects are pretty good.

64,Animus,Burned!,4,9 September 2006,"Ouch, for a movie with such potential, this movie took a beating somewhere along the way. The previews looked good, but seemed to indicate that this movie was about 4 young witches who would have to confront a 5th outsider who was coming for them. Thats not quite how it goes. Our Hero, Caleb, is about to turn 18 and ""Ascend"" to his full Power, and start down the long road to self destruction. The Power lets him do just about anything he wants, for a price. The more Power these ""Ascended"" use, the older they get, the fire that burns twice as bright burns half as long I guess. Although why they age is not really explained well. On one hand the Power becomes their life, but at the same time it doesn't get used up it just ages the body when you use it. Anyway it's Caleb and his three buddies, I can't even remember the other three characters names since they seemed to exist only so there would be 4 of them for the story. These ""Sons of Ipswitch"" will Ascend soon, Caleb's time comes around first and this makes him leader of the group. Caleb is the Hero, its pretty simple the other three are the ""strong and dumb"" friend, the ""quiet and disciplined"" friend and the ""idiot"" friend. These three spend the movie standing around and making Caleb look better by comparison. The offer no other useful input to the movie. They don't do anything useful, say anything interesting or even help him out in the end, they are just there. Chase is the bad guy, its not hard to figure it out, although it gets hard to tell him apart from Caleb since they look a lot alike and dress a lot alike. Chase is kind of Caleb's evil twin skippy. SPOILER ALERT!!! * * * The end is a real letdown, instead of a good witchy fight using nature in all its guises of lighting, wind, water, earth and animals as one might expect, the final showdown is little more than a poor ""Matrix"" rehash mixed with ""Dragonball Z"" power-ball tossing. Caleb gets his power but it is not enough to deal with his evil twin skippy so his dad ""wills"" him his own power, increasing Caleb's to the level of skippy. Now this of course begs the question that if you can will the power to someone, but die in the process, why haven't all the fathers of these ""Sons of Ipswitch"" done so on their deathbeds?

It is a simple movie with a simple plot. So, let's get started. Caleb Danvers (Strait) is a hot warlock who hangs out with other hot warlocks and who likes the hot new girl, Sarah Wenham (Ramsey). When an evil, but equally hot warlock named Chase Collins (Stan) comes to town, he wants to take Caleb's powers and the two begin an all-out war against each other. Special effects, sexy bodies, and spiders (?) ensue. ""The Covenant"" really is that simple and that shallow. There are a few themes and subplots that add a bit more depth to the otherwise light movie, but, honestly, that depth is very limited. ""The Covenant"" fails to be anything more than a ninety minutes entertaining action thriller with a gorgeous cast.What would happen if you took a load of ""Abercrombie & Fitch"" models, put them at a private school, and gave the best-looking guys superpowers and then threw in one ""Gap"" model with stronger superpowers? I would imagine that it would look very similar to ""The Covenant"". Everyone in this movie is so amazingly good looking that you watch it and one of the biggest thoughts that comes to mind is, ""What kind of school do they go to? I want to go!"" You would think that there would be at least someone who isn't completely gorgeous, but, alas, there is not. Do not get me wrong, however; the cast does relatively well, giving solid performances. The biggest problem they face is some very weak dialog, but most of them handle it decently.Steven Strait leads the shockingly good-looking cast admirably. He underplays it, keeping his performance realistic. I was surprised that he didn't overact, because it would have been very easy to do so here. Sebastian Stan does overact somewhat, but it works. He doesn't come off as annoying and, instead, appears to be very evil and slightly eccentric. It worked well enough, though I do think that had he underplayed it as well, it would have made his character all the more sinister. Laura Ramsey gives an honest, likable performance. Ramsey has only done a few movies, though she has proved to be a very solid actress. It doesn't hurt that she is unbelievably gorgeous. Kyle Schmid plays a jerkI feel like I've seen that before. He did what he needed to do, because he got on my nerves and I wanted to reach into the screen and strangle him. Job done! Jessica Lucas, like Ramsey, is very sympathetic here. Also like Ramsey, she is very likable. Taylor Kitsch, Chace Crawford, and Toby Hemingway all do competent enough jobs, though, for the most part, they are all interchangeable.""The Covenant"" is a very flawed film, but it is an entertaining one. Despite being utterly predictable and clichéd, it was a fun little thriller that kept me interested the entire time. Its biggest problem is that it takes itself far too seriously. It is a movie about dueling warlocks! Have a little more fun with it! The movie's villain also becomes far too clichéd when he is revealed to be the villain. He starts babbling off one-liners and laughing maniacally. On top of that, it was absolutely no fun trying to predict who the villain wasbecause the trailer revealed it (not through hidden undertones, but through blatantly stating it). So, why did the movie try to pretend like we didn't know who the baddie was? But, it was fun to watch two hot warlocks battling it out with a hot girl in the middle. The movie, despite some horrible dialog and a predictably predictable plot, was more fun that it should have been. It kept me entertained and that was good enough for me.Final Thought: ""The Covenant"", though predictable, was an entertaining watch.Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)",The Covenant
66,native_girl333,Birthright can be a curse sometimes,6,12 June 2007,"My country-man Renny Harlin is back and this time with a little magic. ""The Covenant"" is a story of Ipswich boys who are the offspring of powerful five families. Boys possess great powers. The power is seductive. It might grow on them with severe consequences...Movie's plot is a little too guessable and it doesn't have so much of an extraordinary marks but ""The Covenant"" manages to entertain. I was positively surprised. In bits ""The Covenant"" was even thrilling. The film is a mixture of action, supernatural and thriller in the same potion. It's ""The Craft"" meets ""Lost Boys"" meets Harry Potter meets Backstreet Boys. The young cast looks good but they are in the developing stage on acting. Someday these guys especially Steven Strait might be hot starsOnce again it is shown that possessing great powers is partly a heavy cross to bear. Like all the superheroes before the Ipswich boys have huge responsibilities when it comes to their powers. The fact that they are partly human is surfacing. Sometimes we can't handle all the things that are given to us. In ""The Covenant"" the matter makes no exceptions.Renny Harlin's career in Hollywood has been tricky but Harlin's talents are showing in ""The Covenant"". What is good in the film is that the often forced, heavy action scenes are left to the end and the whole film isn't run till the end like in for example Harlin's ""Driven"". The difference in ""The Covenant"" is that J.S Cardone's script has clearly a plot. It is nice to watch a movie that despite of lacking the film doesn't put you asleep. We Finns can be proud of our own boy but we are still waiting to hear that Renny has finally made some movie which leaves the audience catching their breath in amazement.But well done! This is definitely a movie of Renny Harlin to watch! Yet I was left wondering: where was Renny's trademark, something from Finland?",The Covenant
67,santurcedc,Where Was Sam & Dean Winchester When I Needed Them,5,28 December 2020,The only thing hot or great about this movie was the hot young 4 male Warlocks.

70,Cemetarygirl,Its an illusion,3,28 September 2007,"Even though I was expecting Lost Boys sans teeth. I must say I prefer Lost Boys, which more than lived up to its promise. On the other hand this movie was pretty, pretty actors, pretty scenery, pretty effects and pretty dull. Apart from the effects and the father who looked like David Bowie in the Hunger, nothing much captured my imagination. No jumps no bumps no amazing magic and no effort made. This movie depended on the stylised children of the corn. Where was the fat kid or the geeks or the goths. And to be honest I don't know that many well off Witches who can afford private schools and estates. As per usual I wont go into the plot as others who have gone before have already done that. Suffice to say I went away from this movie wondering if I had actually done anything. If you want a great dueling Warlocks then do yourself a favour and watch The Raven, much much better and much more fun too.",The Covenant
71,fritzlang,Great popcorn flick!,8,7 September 2006,"Just came back from an advanced screening tonight.No, this isn't going to win any awards. It didn't 'reinvent the genre'. It is just a very well made horror/action film.Renny Harlin has taken a bunch of unknowns, a small budget, and has made a great looking film with some nicely fleshed out characters, nice fight scenes, some decent scares, and some VERY impressive special effects.What really impressed me most of all was the tender love story between the teenage couple. When was the last time you saw a film where teenagers were in love and they just kissed, smiled and said goodnight? it was so sweet and innocent - far from the graphic bump and grind of most of today's film. I suppose the PG-13 was partly responsible for that - and if so, then bring on more PG-13 teenage films! Don't let the PG-13 put you off. This is a very good film that anyone should enjoy...even adults like me : ) If you have seen the trailer and liked it, then I think you will like the film. I had a great time tonight and will get this when it comes out on DVD..",The Covenant
72,pookey56,the covenaters,4,4 January 2007,"i cant say that this film is a real stinker, compared to some of the stinkiest films i've ever seen. But as i was watching it, i couldn't help but think of the guy who started this all with the classic, SCANNERS, and other films with mind-power guys such as the much much much better than THE COVENANT: DARK CITY, STAR WARS, LOTR, BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, KUNG FU HUSTLE, as well as that episode on SOUTH PARK where Cartman was wee-wee weening people with his brain powers. I'm pretty sure i'm forgetting some of the other films too. I find it hard to even comment on the content of this movie, such as it is. This movie is what it is. You may even like it better than MATERIAL GIRLS, BLOODRAYNE, and BASICALLYITSTINKS2 (thank you, Mr.Wilson). During the fifties many directors made films about the latest and greatest technologies and space ventures to show how science and technology could go so terribly wrong. Some of them were great; some of them were so bad they were camp. THE COVENANT is neither. I wont be watching this movie again because frankly, it doesn't interest me. i've seen better X-Box commercials with clearer intent.",The Covenant
73,azcowboysingr,I enjoyed it.,7,31 July 2007,"While I had my doubts about this one (whoever puts together movie trailers usually has never watched a film...lol), I ended up enjoying it. Certainly not a classic like The Craft, or even Practical Magic, but still pretty good for a late night Saturday thriller flick. The SFX are very impressive, with lots of explosions, fantastic flying wire stunts, & fires/wrecks, etc. The kids who starred in it really do need some acting classes, but I've seen a lot worse too. The blond girl was really a cutie...what a shame she kept her clothes on for so much of the movie. The plot left a lot to be desired, but the action sequences more than made up for the sloppy script. The director did an OK job too although not in a class with some of the old Universal horror films. All in all, if you need a date movie that pretty scary, rent this one & cuddle up on the couch with the lights off. I promise you, when the spiders come crawling, so will she...lol.",The Covenant
74,The_Defiant1,Don't Go With High Expectations,5,16 September 2006,"This movie is essentially for teenagers. The cool boys in the school meet the cool girls. The boys have supernatural powers and it's all about being in control and appealing to the opposite sex. The plot itself is fairly shallow and offers no twists or turns.Unlike the movie ""Underworld"", this movie moves a little too slow and doesn't have anything interesting to offer other than some occasional special effects and some scantily clad actors. The girls run around in their underwear and the boys walk around in swim trunks.The special effects and the display of the supernatural powers are very well done, but after awhile they evoke yawns, and not excitement. You can only slam people around so much before it quits adding to the plot. The movie fails at upping the ante. No matter how intense the action should feel, it all just looks like more of the same.Strangely, the adults in this movie offer forth the worst acting. The younger actors do quite well and it is the story and overall plot which leaves the most to be desired.The movie isn't bad, it just isn't good either.",The Covenant
75,zerogirl42,Warning: Movie contains at least 42 clichés,5,10 January 2007,"Let's clear this up first, The Covenant is not a very good film. However, it can be quite an enjoyable film under the right circumstances.It's best viewed with a friends who like to heckle movies (which was how I saw it). We started to keep count of scary, movie clichés because it was so easy to predict what was going to happen next. There's a shower scene, the waking-up-to-find-out-it-was-all-a-dream scene, the creepy-house-that-everyone-avoids scene, ancient curses, damsels in distress, bugs, (OK, I'm not going list all 42). You name it, it was there.Perhaps the most baffling part was the casting. Three of the male leads looked almost exactly like each other. We started to refer to one of the them as the ""shriveled one"" because he was slightly smaller than the other two. Eventually my friends agreed that one of them had lighter hair too, but it was hard to tell because some of the scenes were so dark.The Covenant is about as scary and an average Buffy or Angel episode.There were some good special effects (mostly shown in the trailer).If you need an even worse movie to heckle, I suggest finding copy of Ninja Squad (on the back of the DVD it even refers to itself as a Trashterpiece).",The Covenant

78,phillipstephenso,Excellent,10,23 September 2006,"This movie is worth seeing for the opening title sequence alone, which matches images and music together in a rhythmic montage, while previewing motifs of the film with stunning transitions and sound effects. And, this high level of computerized special effects and photography and rocking music is generally sustained throughout the film. Autumn scenery and the picturesque buildings of the former realm of the witch hunters of the Massachusetts Bay Colony successfully invoke spookiness appropriate to the season and the themes of the movie. The young male actors are easy on the eyes, especially Steven Strait in the shower and swimming scenes. And, the plot is intriguing as it explores the consequences of a mysterious covenant among five families descending from the 1692 witches of Ipswich, Massachusetts. The line of male descendants on their eighteenth birthday ascend to supernatural powers common to witches. Of course, this necessarily involves teenage rivalries and rumbles that take on heightened dimensions, as the covenant members use supernatural powers to escape the normal consequences of youthful follies and to express overwhelming urges toward love and loyalty and pride.",The Covenant

But no I was surprised to see that in fact we had a film with YES a poor story line but decently acted and some great special effects. Lots of wire work in this similar to Underworld but all in all a decent film i thought.I fail to see why it got torn to pieces on this site and has such a low rating. The film is based around the sons of ipswich basically some kids whose decendants have passed down Whitch like powers. It kinda reminded me of lost boys.Also some great eye candy with Laura Ramsey.

80,brodie_kashmir,Dreadful,1,31 December 2006,"When watching the new Renny Harlin flick ""The Covenant"", one has to ask themselves ""Am I at a movie theatre, or did I just turn on the Saturday Night Sci-Fi Channel movie?"" Ipswitch, Mass. was founded in the 1600's by five families who fled England because of their mystical pagan powers. The Putman's were thought to have been killed off in during the Salem witch trials. Now, in 2006, the four male descendents of the remaining families are developing their magical powers, with the leader, Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait), reaching the full maturation of his powers on his 18th birthday. The families formed this covenant to keep each other in check, as the powers drain the life force of those using it. The long lost heir of the Putman family comes back into town to take all the powers for himself.I found three metaphors in the film: puberty (get the powers at 13 years old, with full maturation at 18), drugs (the powers are addicting and slowly kill you) and to a lesser extent homosexuality (""my adoptive father caught me using magic when I was 15, and we kept it quiet""). All three were obvious, yet an attempt was still made to obscure them.The lore and mythology was presented in an un-convoluted way. It's easy to follow and straightforward. So there's nothing inherently wrong with it. It's just simplistic and derivative, with nothing to really get excited about. You could almost figure it out without having even seen the movie.Harlin seems to have taken a cue from MTV in making this film, adopting the philosophy of ""Laguna Beach"" that everyone in your high school just got back from a Teen People photo shoot. He must have cast models, as there isn't a shred of acting talent in the entire young cast. At the end of the film I was wondering if I had seen a film comprised entirely of cut footage and rehearsal shots. I was left with the distinct impression that just off camera was a stagehand holding a stack of cue cards for the cast to read from.And the camera work was straight out of the late 80's to early 90's music video library. Half of it looked like a schlock Ozzy Osbourne video, the other half resembled Madonna's ""Like a Prayer."" This kind of film-making is completely unappealing. I understand that the core audience is probably 13-18 year old girls, and they most likely find that sort of film-making wondrous and spellbinding. Unfortunately for Harlin, and myself, 13-18 year old girls aren't the only ones who see films. There's a whole world of intense film-making techniques out there that would have made this film more enjoyable and pleasing to the eye. I know. I've seen it. Many have developed and mastered these techniques. But Harlin, no matter how much of a seasoned veteran he is, is making mistakes and ""artistic choices"" that reek of rookie director.Not to mention the end fight scene seemed taken punch for punch from the Saruman/Gandalf fight in ""Lord of the Rings"" or Harry/Voldemort fight in ""Harry Potter"". I could go on and on about how this reeks of un-originality: ""The Craft"" with dudes or ""The Lost Boys"" with witches.",The Covenant
81,SoutheastUK,"If you're 12 and slightly backwards, you'll like it",2,15 September 2007,"As with all films, I start with an open mind based on experience which dictates that even the worst possible setup can surprise you and turn out to be entertaining.This movie - alas - falls short.Based around the idea of a group of secret male witches whos bloodline extends from those poor souls hunted during the salam massacres, this had an opportunity to be an interesting, entertaining and engaging movie. But then the script writer must have been hit repeatedly about the head with a large, heavy object.To make matters worse, the casting staff decided - presumably in a fit of revolutionary pique - to pick the cast from the telephone directory....mostly from the sewer and drainage operatives section.The dialogue is abysmal, the phraseology belongs in the ""pre-teenage dirtbag"" hall of fame and the plot (plot?!) is apparently random.This isn't worth anyones time or money and both of the two stars I've given it are ""bought"" by the mediocre special effects.Garbage.",The Covenant
82,TRussellMorris,Darker Craft Clone : Boy Version,8,30 June 2021,"Great little witch movie, makes a perfect double feature with The Craft and I think of this as the darker boy version. Aside from the cliché romance which they pay little attention too and of course the ""PG-13 curse"" so many good horror movies have fallen to in the 2000's and 2010's, even today. This movie is still despite those things a super engaging and fun movie for me. The atmosphere, visuals, cinematography, SFX, and the cast were just spot on. I can only imagine what an R-Rating, allowing this movie to go full force, would have been. A true classic masterpiece of the genre is my guess had it not hampered itself with the pg-13, I was shocked at it once viewing the movie since this wasn't even really aimed at 14 year olds and the movie works much better aimed at an adult audience. Too bad they didn't let it fly as such. Even still, I pretty much loved every minute of it. Great attractive cast, couple of giggle peeps to satisfy the eyes, of both genders at that, which was refreshing. I loved the darkness of this film, kept me in an ""Underworld"" mood and fit the story well...lots of blacks and dark blue color themes. My wishes for a Director's Cut not withstanding, I am so glad I finally got around to buying this movie and was very satisfied...only wish they had made a sequel. Loved it.

It seemed as if the cast just blurted out lines. Ugh. The fight scene was so boring I guess I slept that's why I wasn't able to see it much. Special effects-- nice, but it will not save the movie! Also, I find it a little too cliché. There's the good guy, his girl, a bad guy, and the good guy's pals. They go to a bar, hook up with girls, and soon they realize... there's a ghost.

87,adudewhoiscool,There are worst ways you can spend your Saturday or Sunday afternoon,7,13 September 2006,"Going into seeing ""The Covenant,"" I had little expectations. I had expected this to be a big budget movie, full of action sequences and nothing else. Some parts of me believed it would be terrible, but other parts of me had hope because ""Underworld,"" the producers of ""The Covenant,"" was great. Honestly, I can say that I enjoyed it. There were flaws, but not enough for me to walk out or demand my money back.In 1692, in the Ipswich Colony of Massachusetts, five families with untold power formed a covenant of silence. One family, lusting for more, was banished and their bloodline disappearing without a trace. Four young students at the elite Spencer Academy who are bound by their sacred ancestry. These boys have all been born with special powers. The powers, however, are addictive; if they use them excessively, they will start to weaken and age. The fifth ""Son of Ipswich"" has surfaced and has plans to destroy the other four and steal their powers for himself.The premise had a lot of potential. I must admit it did fulfill its potential since it focused manly on the premise then the action sequences. It was more then just a good vs. evil story; it was a story about battling yourself. I liked how there was an obvious metaphor about drugs ruining your body. This should be used as life lessons for teens of today. Unfortunately, there were zero twists or surprises, which means that everything told in the trailers happened in the movie and just that; nothing more.For a group of unknown actors, the acting could have been a lot worse. Everyone did their jobs and all made believable teenagers. Steven Strait (Caleb Danvers), Taylor Kitsch (Pogue Parry), Toby Hemingway (Reid Garwin), and Chase Crawford (Tyler Sims) played the four main characters concentrated on. Sebastian Stan (Chase Collins) plays the villain. Laura Ramsey and Jessica Lucas (Sarah Wenham and Kate Tunney), were also believable as two teenage roommates.Some people might complain about the horrible dialog, especially coming from the character, Chase Collins. I personally enjoy it because it was very campy and comic book like. Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) and the Joker (Jack Nicholson) were like that, yet there is no one complaints. Why should you make a complain about Chase Collins? It looked like Sebastian Chase had fun with the character. Sure it was more comic book then graphic novel, ""The Covenant"" is based on a graphic novel, but it was still fun nonetheless. Visually, I felt I was watching ""Underworld"" without the Lycans and Vampires. The special effects were decent as well. There was nothing new or revolutionary, but for a low budget movie, $20 million- low for today's standard, it was still acceptable. Most blockbuster movies run about five times that amount, and some have even reached up to ten times the amount. A final battle between Chase and Caleb reminded me of a ""Street Fighter"" battle, which some may complain about, that made me feel very nostalgic. The cast is loaded with eye candy for both the male and the female audience.While ""The Covenant"" is placed in the action/horror/thriller genre, it should not be considered a horror. Two scenes involved spiders, which I will not reveal anymore, which would not look out of place in a classic horror movie and I was surprised how well those scenes worked. Unfortunately, other than those couple of scenes, the movie is not scary. Therefore, if you go into ""The Covenant"" expecting a horror you will be disappointed.The writing could have used some improvement! They needed to spend a little more time explaining some of the subplots. One example was that the four main heroes kept referencing ""darklings."" We knew what they look like, but nothing else. In addition to the unexplained subplots, one of the characters, Taylor Sims, was horribly underused. I believe he only had one line in the whole movie. They could have just taken him out of the script since he had no purpose. They even left the ending open for a sequel. If they release a sequel, they should spend more time on the things mentioned above. I would be up for seeing one, though it might be more suited for a television series.Overall, I enjoyed ""The Covenant."" It was not one of the better movies, but there certainly have been worse. If you enjoy movies that are part supernatural, part comic book, and part TV movie, you will like this. I could see why there were complaints, but I think those were from people that took it far too seriously. This is not a DVD worthy purchase but when going into the theater on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, to spend your $8.50 or more, you should still consider this.",The Covenant

The ending of the movie was I think the worse part because it left a lot of questions unanswered...I think that, had this movies been part of a series, it would have been more plausible...

I was reminded of comic book story made to theater movie a la Spiderman, Batman etc.Everyone gets a passing grade for their profession in participating in creating this film. The premise was excellent. The plot was okay, but I wanted better. The acting was decent. The special effects were above average. I enjoyed the fight at the end with the power balls in the style of Dragon Ball Z. Although I could have done less with unconvincing villain monologue. I thought they handled the subject of magic in a cool way  with the obvious nonverbal spells, the spider spell and the gliding/flying.The most convincing scene was the opening scene.

So, going into this one, I had little hope (if any). The story isn't the most originial thing I've ever heard of, but it's not a carbon copy of anything else. The story development is pretty straight-forward and predictable. The graphics are what you'd expect, as well. My main complaint with this film is what I call gratuitous dialogue: when people talk too much or think outloud to fill the audience in on what they're thinking. There's a lot of ""ha ha I'm so evil"" talk from the villain, as well. But, hey, if you can't have fun at the movies, why bother going? All in all, worth seeing at least once.",The Covenant
92,gazzalere,I loved this movie!!!,10,23 September 2006,"OK..... I went to watch this movie tonight mainly because i am a film maker myself & i make movie just like this one, I actually went into the cinema expecting a full on horror movie but thats not what i got! When i started watching to start with it came across as another chick flick/thriller kind of movie but as it progressed it became more like a Lost Boy's style movie and i started to really really like it!!!! Overall i have to give this movie a 100 out of 100 if that was possible but it isn't so i have give it a ten out of ten because it's got a great story, great actors and its original, i will definitely be buying this on DVD when its released and to the rest of you i say that you better also buy it or you'll be missing out on one good original story!!!!",The Covenant
93,elroy_geronimo,Charmed on Steroids,4,20 September 2006,"Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to let the door open for a part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser. I'd suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' kicked ass and I only watched that show to please my girlfriend!!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you've got nothing better to do. Or better yet download it so you don't waste your money. The first 15 minutes were alright. But the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when Reid says : ""Kiss my ass Harry Potter"", while driving of a cliff. Although they are not worthy to kiss Potter's ass, because Potter is way cooler and at least his movies have a story. The Goblet of fire was even scarier than this!!!",The Covenant
94,steel_indigo,Paranormal romance with a twist,8,24 March 2013,I personally love this movie but as anyone who has done research into the so-called witch hunt it didn't happen directly in Salem anyway. The idea that it is the males that are the witches wasn't believable to me. That was one of the problems. Witchcraft has always been a female oriented idea. Men have been within this circle but not primary. So therefore many get confused between sorcery and witchcraft but this is fiction so the premise is fine. I thought the dialog was typical for the age range of those within the story. There was nothing wrong with the acting at all and the overall premise of the story very unique and the special effects were awesome. It was an enjoyable movie not meant to be exactly scary but more of a psychological thriller with a paranormal twist. I think this movie is highly underrated and overly criticized compared to other movies that have come out of this type. I would have chosen something else to use instead of spiders in the magical end of things because the use of spiders is redundant in these types of movies but it did make its impact quite well even so. This story is about young people who are in their very late teens on the edge of adulthood so the interaction of all of the characters was portrayed quite well. Sebastian Stan was excellent as the antagonist in the film and should have gotten more credit for his part in the movie. This was a unique departure into the world of early colonists that were accused of witchcraft and what they had to do to remain alive and in the background. Also how the overuse of their gift had a very dark consequence and beguiling draw that had to be avoided at all cost. They likened it to an addiction that was very well portrayed in the movie.,The Covenant
95,Dukes_Sheep,"Not bad, just not good",5,16 September 2006,"My daughter wanted to see this. I suggested the Black Dahlia instead because I could at least look at Scarlett Johansson.I lost and had to see this. It had potential and I'm not sure if it lost it through some wooden acting, bad editing or if it was the effect one of the worse score's I've ever heard in a movie had on the whole experience. Probably a combination of all of the above.I was also wondering if I was the only person that had trouble telling Caleb and Shane apart in the fight scenes. Too guys, similar looks and build, put them in similar clothing and poor lighting and I had trouble.Save your money and if you really have to see it wait for the DVD rental because it sure isn't good enough to buy.",The Covenant
96,Doctor_No,"For me to recommend this I'd have to gouge your eyes out first, one of the years WORST",1,9 September 2006,"1/2*, oh boy, oh boy. Hollywood's turned to witch craft again. With the all female cast of ""The Craft"" they switch it up here and change those voluptuous gals to guys. But not just guys, guys with problems. This whole movie runs like an episode of ""Sabrina the teenage witch"" and ""Dawson's Creek"". Everyone is bickering and fighting in spite of other powers and some other stuff. Honestly I have no idea what this movie was about or tried to put off. The effects were terrible, as was the directing, acting, writing and I even blame the best boy on this account for helping to feed these bums! I hated this movie so much it has nothing in it. But if you look at the trailer you see they have to EXPLAIN every detail just to sum up the movie in a short 2 minutes, expand that!",The Covenant
97,Stoli_Raz_N_7,A Great Idea Poorly Executed.,3,3 January 2007,"Just when I started thinking that Uwe Boll has a monopoly on turning great story ideas into horrible movies, Renny Harlin shows up and reminds me once again why he is the undisputed king of crappy cinema. Behold the evidence of his royal pukie-ness: one more in an endless stream of butt-stupid movies.When the metaphysical power behind witchcraft is an addiction more seductive and self-destructive than heroin and crack combined, what happens when a super-junkie finds a way to steal the power of others just to keep riding his high? Though the original plot and storyline of the film were quite intriguing and solid ideas, Harlin and screenwriter J.S. Cardone managed to infantilize the dialogue so that even crack-whores and NASCAR fans would still think it was pretty lame.Then Harlin added his special touch; that indefinable quality of his that perfectly demonstrates his utter lack of imagination. He turned what could have been a phenomenal battle of supernatural powers (I was hoping for the Dark Phoenix versus Emperor Palpatine on Steroids) into a schoolyard scrap involving explosive water balloons. Sadly, Ken and Ryu did it better in the original Street Fighter arcade game.Harlin dropped the final nail in the film's coffin by casting a bunch of no-talent rejects from Melrose Creek, 90666. It was probably because no self-respecting actors would have tied themselves to this sinking ship. Apparently after doling out a trifecta of trash with ""Driven"", ""Mindhunters"", and ""Exorcist: The Beginning"", Harlin was hoping to suckle from the same teet that nourished Andrew Fleming's ""The Craft"" and Aaron Spelling's ""Charmed."" Unfortunately that breast has shrivelled up and gone, and all we are left with is a boob who fancies himself a director. Pity for us.",The Covenant
98,limejockey,good pg fun,7,25 September 2006,"There's normally just something wrong with the phrase PG-13 horror. Usually not enough blood for the slasher people, not enough skin for those looking for that type of thing, and they're usually so careful NOT to show anything that might get into R territory that even the scares are toned down to the point of non existence. Here we have a solidly made reasonable well acted and competently produced action horror hybrid which does its level best within the PG guidelines to at least try to generate some creepiness, since no real heavy shocks are or can be involved. It involves a set of families that have kept a secret promise ergo covenant and what happens when the latest generations of these families begin to test their limits. Reasonable story for what it is, absolutely gorgeous if somewhat dreary scenery, effects are reasonable for the obvious budget constraints, and the acting in general is at least serviceable to the story. If you're looking for a reasonably well made movie of the PG horror type you should check this one out.",The Covenant
99,strain6,A Solid Saturday Matinée Movie,8,9 September 2006,"I saw this movie on a rainy Saturday afternoon in September when I had nowhere to go and nothing to do. It is about a bunch of essentially nice guys who have special gifts that allow them to cut up, which they don't do at the anyone's expense. There is no need for Adlerian superiority striving if you can make bullies puke at will. They are good students and take part in athletics and have a healthy interest in girls. Conflict develops when a bad apple comes along. He acts like the kids who don't have magical power. I don't want to give anything away, but he makes an ass of himself and doesn't end up very well. The movie has a good look. The production values are rich. The special effects aren't distracting. It might even have a good message that I haven't figured out yet: Don't use your power for evil or don't be a dick. Beats me. As I said this is good movie for a lazy Saturday afternoon. The mandatory minority appeasement character was annoying. As in 13 Ghosts, Freddie vs Jason and countless others, the character is written into the script for reasons totally extraneous to the actual story. There will come time when all the movies that bear this quaint stamp will look ridiculous and the film-makers as craven as they are.",The Covenant
100,omouallem,Trite horror that doesn't even suffice for a B-Movie,3,16 September 2006,"A lot of work goes into making a movie. It has to be written, mailed, optioned, sold, produced, marketed and sold again. Millions of dollars, and months are spent for your entertainment, which is why I am amazed that The Covenant made it to the SASE stage, let alone the big screen.In the 1600's, five families possessing supernatural powers descended from an ambiguous incident. They are the Sons of Ipswich. Sons because the mystic gene is only inherited by the eldest male of each family. If women already believe that men have an unfair advantage in the work field, then these boys further the inequality.The bloodline has transcended time and lives in Caleb, Pogue, Reid and Tylerfour 17 year-old heartthrobs. They use their addictive powers wisely: jump starting cars, triumphing in 8-ball, and lifting skirts to bet on the color of panties. They are what Harry Potter would become if he hung with the wrong crowd.But of the five families, one was evil and used their powers for corruption. They were eradicated in a genocidal witch hunt, or so the Ipswich thought. When new-guy Chase is transferred to their school, bad stuff happens. Bad, evil stuff.Ten minutes in I was hit with a juggernaut of deja vu. I realized that I was watching the bottom-shelf, President's Choice version of The Lost Boys, save the ingredients that made it a cult classic.Director Renny Harlin (of the Oscar-snubbed Mindhunters and Nightmare on Elm Street 4) has constructed a pastiche of B-movie clichés. Insert high-octane car chase here; frightened girl in shower here; sporadic, head-spinning, jump-cutting ghoul here, here and here. Typical of the teen horror genre, it is as if Joseph Stalin had set quotas for gratuitous titillation.The dialogue is no more potent. With so much back story and exposition to be communicated, we are subjected to lines like, ""Those powers that you and your friends developed when you were 13, are nothing!"" Anymore on the nose and it would be a nose job.With virtually no star power, The Covenant relies on a cast of Toshiba robots whose only promising feature is their stifling beauty. Because the powers they use cause rapid-aging, the teens appear to be in their mid-twenties. This may also explain why the cast of 90210 was so overdeveloped.The film does offer a didactic ""don't do drugs"" moral of sorts. These powers are addictive and are only to be experimented with. When they are abused, it is to their detriment. Impressionable teens can learn a lot from this. As well as how to evade police through a narrow forest road, fly off a cliff, then drop from the sky from behind them, only to taunt.Aside from the ostentatious cinematography, this film offers nil, leaving me to believe that it is a tax write-off.",The Covenant

Another lump of mass produced vomit with no redeeming features whatsoever (except for the naked girl in the shower... YAHOOO!) The story is very straightforward... feels like I've watched it a hundred times already and I probably have.These guys have power to do all sorts of things, right?

102,nicole_ward,Enjoyable,8,25 March 2012,"So I watched this film after finding it by browsing around on IMDb. I'm really glad I decided to watch it! I wouldn't say it's the best film in the world, but I certainly enjoyed it. It is a typical teen/young adult film and therefore is aimed at this audience. I would recommend people to watch it but only those who enjoy these films that are aimed at this particular audience. If you are looking for a full, action packed supernatural film then you would be disappointed as you only get a bit of it. Yes, it is supernatural but there is not much action which I personally think would have made it a much better film.It obviously wasn't a huge blockbuster film (as many of the films I watch tend not to be), and therefore those looking for big Hollywood top rated films should stay away from The Covenant film.My main disappointment with this film was the ending. The ending is left on a cliffhanger and there should be a second film to follow I think. However, there is no second film so we never get to have the story finished which I would have liked to have seen.One thing for the girls – the guys in this film are seriously HOT.So, watch the trailer and if you think it looks like you could enjoy it then go for it!",The Covenant

Then I saw that Horror was also there, and I thought to myself *WHY????* It made the film even worse for me (Horror is my second favourite genre, with Thriller being my favourite)I wouldn't bother with this film.

104,fthurston-29424,Best film I've seen in a very long time.,10,27 August 2015,"Yep definite plot spoilers.OMG This film, put simply... Rocked.From casting decisions (Yay to whom ever cast Steven Straight, he was simply born for the role!) to story-line I had fun all the way. OH and the Lighting! I never comment on lighting because to me, that's a background thing I never care to comment on, but damn the Covenant did really well! Every single scene I just loved the dark lighting, it was perfect.I started watching this film seeing nothing more than a poster (which is not normal for me as normally I see a trailer or 2) and right from the get go (when they drove the car over the cliff to get away from the cops) I was hooked! I found myself screaming with glee watching the car go over the cliff he he.The CGI was awesome, from the black-eyes to the execution of powers. OK so Sarah was a little blah, but I can understand why they needed her (not to discredit the actress, I was just personally hoping her character would get powers too).The final fight scene totally kicked ass. I loved the entire scene! The only thing that Im really really stuck on is how there is no sequel to this film. Regardless of if you loved it or hated it, the film left open ended as no one knows exactly what happened to Chase. So I feel let down that that specific loose end was never tied up. If anything they should have just left the firemen scene out of the film altogether and just gone from Sarah waking up - to driving off and fixing the windows of the car. But again I just want to say how much I loved this film! I could watch it 100 times a year and still not be sick of it. Were the guys hot? Yes. But was that why I loved it? No. I genuinely loved the whole magical storyline! Well done Renny Harlin 10/10",The Covenant

This is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term. Poorly written and weakly directed with so-called actors unable to act, but able to grimace when ordered to. For the first 60 minutes the story appears to be going in one direction, then it changes tack and gets involved in a power fight, with extremely poor special effects. Unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers, the ""writer"" cheats. It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story-line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denouement. Not that the write would even know the word ""denouement.""

106,stuart-193,Supernatural hits the big screen,5,11 April 2007,"If you like the TV series Supernatural, you'll likely appreciate this. However, without the development of a continuing series, the script in The Covenant doesn't deliver the same punch over 90 minutes compared to the 45 minute TV show. The plot is popcorn simple, probably too simple to pad out a feature, so character depth and background is not big on the menu here unlike its TV counterparts. Having said that, the direction good enough for the genre, the acting is OK and the specials are nice and expensive and in the same vein as Underworld - glossy. Still, a lacking of real substance and the ""teen"" style doesn't really lift it further than TV, which probably explains why it missed mainstream cinema distribution in the UK, going straight to DVD in most regions. Why 6/10? Because it was watchable enough.",The Covenant

We have our usual string of cliché story, boy meets girl, boy needs to save girl, and damsel in distress. You can find this variety of movie in many places, but it still grabs a unique version on takes of magic. Using power comes with a cost, such as draining life essence. I will give this movie props though, for giving away a creepy atmosphere, and sometimes watchful music uses. If you wanna just have a nice time, not so great, but not terrible flick.

The script is so weak that by the time you actually get around to figuring out what is going on, you no longer care at all about the story or the characters. I was confusing the lead and the antagonist until close to the end of the movie (they both look quite alike). At least it pulls together close to the end to make some sort of sense.The only thing this has going for it is somewhat decent special effects.I won't even bother getting into details, it's that bad. If you're looking for attractive people then this might fit your bill, but unlike starship troopers (Beverly Hills 90210 in space with kick-ass alien bugs), this isn't a cult classic and there is no re-watch value.

Where was it?? The boys (they may be men in a few years, but they are still trying to pass themselves off as adolescents. Pity. Some of us were shaving 2-3 times a day at age 15.) were mediocre to ugly and the women were, although nicely top-heavy, hardly breathtaking, Jessica Lucas being the only feast for the eyes in the entire movie.The drug addiction theme was laid on a bit thick, but perhaps that is more realistic than some people give it credit (have you ever talked to druggies? They only want to talk about 1 thing most of the time) so I will pass.What really got me was trying to figure out where this was filmed? Obviously not New England, but since this is a ""Hollywood"" movie ... must be .. CANADA!

113,algjgg,Pretty fair movie with a few agitating gripes,6,30 January 2008,"The Covenant may be (in my opinion) one of the most underrated movies out there. It's directed by an average/bad director (Renny Harlin), who directed Deep Blue Sea. Harlin had a pretty good idea going on about midway through this movie. It started off with a really good start, but as it unfolded further into the movie, it lost its touch, and right when the final fight and climax begun, everything was lost. Other problems also occur, like the lack of imagination when it comes to the fighting. Throwing balls of energy and bunny-hopping in the air back and forth gets really boring, as well as a lack of cinematography in each fight. Another problem would be the people with powers. The main character Caleb Danvers is interesting and all, but his friends who share the same powers as he does barely have any background and each one lacks good character development. They may be buffed up and all, but don't get all excited cause there's hardly anything to them.One last problem that I have to point out is Harlin's ability to think of new and original ideas (like Deep Blue Sea), and each one turn out to be a huge cluster of nothing. I know I'm not the only one that noticed this, but the last 20 minutes of the movie WERE. . . . .JUST. . . . .STUPID. And it has one of the worst climaxes I've ever seen in a movie. It's cheesy. It's boring. And overall a monster of a buzz-kill. Acting = 3/5Script = 4/5Action = 2/5Climax = 1/5 Overall, a 6/10.",The Covenant
114,ps42,Skip this one...,3,19 September 2006,"I'll be brief in my review of the Covenent. While it is nowhere near the worst movie I've ever seen, it may be the worst theatrical release I have made the mistake of watching in the past year. Name any area of film-making, and the boys that worked on this one manage to muck it up pretty badly. The only notable exception to that statement that comes to mind is the cinematography and editing. I like that cool blue-ish color scheme cast over the entire film, and the editing was fine.Other aspects of the film were below par, and some were just plain abysmal. The dialog is particularly poorly crafted. It feels forced and unnatural throughout, much like the dialog does in a porno. This, however, is only about half the fault of the screenwriters. The rest of the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the actors. A more generic bunch would have been difficult to cast. They're also not particularly solid as actors, but that is to be expected with such a young and unknown cast. Now that I think about it, most of the film was pretty damn generic. The story, which was set in my home state of Massachusetts, was a generic and painfully straightforward abomination on some real history. They made my state look extraordinarily generic, and they used generic, video game quality special effects.This was one of those movies that just really managed to disappoint me. I was really expecting something from it, and it let me down hard. Bottom line: avoid The Covenant for now, and if you're still curious when it comes out on DVD, give it a rental.",The Covenant
115,randomorwhat,Not too bad really...,5,3 August 2007,"When my mate got this film out, I was convinced the acting was going to be terrible, the film would look cheap, and I'd get even more irritated than I did when watching 'The Craft'.I was pleasantly surprised. The effects were pretty damn decent, and the acting, though slightly sub-par at the beginning, definitely improved as the film progressed. The CGI characters were well created, and even the main male leads had a certain amount of depth. Unfortunately this depth was not transferred to the other female characters within the film.This film sufficed for a night-time viewing; you don't need to concentrate too much, you can enjoy the visually decent elements and sometimes even get dragged along by a fairly 'compelling' storyline.Do not expect amazing cinema, because this isn't what the film is about. But there's nothing wrong with that - sometimes it's nice to see a film lacking in pretension and merely being entertainment for entertainment's sake.One final slightly irritating disclaimer - young adults by and large, do not speak in a similar manner to the kids in this film!

The characters are all half-baked, the storyline is poor, the special effects are cheap and over-the-top, and the conversations have some cheesy lines.

But it's honestly not, and it was surprisingly better than I thought.I will say that the 2 leads, Steven Strait(Caleb) and Laura Ramsey(Sarah) are darn good looking and do decent jobs here. Jessica Lucas(Sarah's roommate, Kate) is gorgeous and does some serviceable acting as well. Nothing exceptional, but as both are just starting out, they showed potential.Actually, that's what the whole thing showed. Potential. There's a good backstory that could yield future films in a series, a cast that was likable, a great visual style, some nice side-plots that could be fleshed out more, and I could even see this being turned into a TV series.Visually, the film's beautiful. Renny Harlin's action skills are on display, and he doesn't disappoint. As mentioned above, the cast is filled with eye candy for both genders, with some beautiful girls and well-toned guys. The special effects are nothing revolutionary, but they're well-done IMO.The soundtrack is awesome, and if you like White Zombie, you'll be happy about 1 minute into the film.The villain is the low point, with some REALLY BAD cheese dialogue, but he serves his purpose as a foil for the hero. Some things are left unexplained, and I'm thinking an unrated DVD is forthcoming, or a sequel/prequel. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie.I gave it a 7, which I consider to mean ""worth a watch"". Maybe wait for DVD or catch a matinée if you're skeptical, but I don't think it's a bad film.

Sometimes when a bad movie is directed by a famous Hollywood producer than suddenly the votes are higher. I don't know why. You can always find a stick to hit the sense of a storyline. I've seen it with movies like ""vampiers"" - "" time travel based movies "" - and other of non earthly based scripts... The only way to understand a movie is to place yourself inside it. Go along with it. Go with the flow. I always do that, sometimes it's creepy. Most people watch this type (and even other) movies with a bad simple TV with bright light around it, even bad cinema's will spoil to essence of a movie. I watched it at DTS at a big screen with dimmed lights and that was enough to go on the flow of the movie. The same with Underworld. Marvelous.

The sgi is tv quality the story is meh and before the movie gets going you are one hour later and believe me even when the story gets going your beter off watching fish swim. The story is set Up For a sequal but who in there right minds would ever make it. Its Just a borefest from the minut it starts till the end.,The Covenant
120,Muia17-1,Give it a Shot,10,3 January 2007,"Covenant It was a good movie, i think a lot of people are misjudging this movie or just plain not even giving it a shot. The movie isn't perfect but most aren't. The plot is very good and has a lot of room left for a sequel. The characters are good and the cinematography was done well also. It was written by the writers of Underworld and that was a great movie so you know its not so bad. A lot of times people who give reviews are not honest, they either rate it excellent or horrible his isn't accurate. The movie could of have some things in it that would of made it much better. However all the actors in this movie are all young and inexperienced and thy did a good Job. Bottom line the movie was good and if u have a chance check it out.",The Covenant
121,otankgirl,"Way, way above average!",10,29 November 2007,"In fact I would say this reached a pinnacle for a supernatural thriller. I remember seeing the commercials for this movie on TV. Back then, I thought the previews were great, and the original premise fascinating. Finally I got the chance to pick up a copy. But I went through the IMDb reviews in advance. This really disheartened me. Besides all the crummy reviews, the main rating was below a 5 out of 10, and i NEVER get anything with an IMDb rating that low. Fortunately my memory of the TV ads won out, or I never would have seen this innovative genre piece. Without reservation I am voting for 10 out of 10 here. The understated performance of the male lead Steven Strait pulled me right in and I quickly began to care about him and all the characters in his life. If you are into the ""thinking man's"" horror movie, this is definitely a must-see.",The Covenant

The TV ad showing the car explode and and reassemble is what got me into the theater, but these are spent before the third act, which is filled to the brim of Dragon Ball Z style flinging with power orbs from hands, only difference is DBZ did it better.Girls and gay guys will like all the chiseled man-ass splashed across the screen every 2 minuets, everyone else will be pretty bored.Nick Anderson",The Covenant

Swap the spell-weavers for vampires, and you have 'The Lost Boys'-- minus the acting talent and excellent cinematography. Yes, there are differences-- but they do not outnumber the similarities... there are simply enough to prevent copyright infringement.On the other hand, it's hardly a frontal lobotomy (i.e., if you can rent it cheap, it is sufficient to kill a couple of hours if you have nothing better to dosuch as watch paint dry).

Had I in 2006, it has the elements I would've though in 2006 were the formula to success. A young very attractive cast. And special effects that were just as good or better at times than Charmed, Buffy, Angel, etc.,While it's about magic, and spells are cast... there's something missing here. All the pieces seem to be here, but it just never connects. It's still better than many of thee things you can stumble upon these days streaming, but it's not a must see. It's not memorable. The trailer looks promising. But for me, I'm 2021... it just doesn't connect.",The Covenant
126,Martina_Helene,Skewed,4,4 January 2007,"I understand that this movie is science fiction/fantasy, but the thinking behind this movie was extremely skewed. The basis went by the fact that the Salem Witch Hunts, and other witch hunts in Europe, actually attacked people with supernatural powers. It gave justification to one of the most blatant executions of innocent people in American History (the Salem Witch Hunt). Also, most of the people that were considered ""withces"" in MA during the 18th century were older women living alone. It was a prejudicial and hysterical movement, in which NONE of the accusations were true. Yet, The Covenant made it seem like people actually believed to this day, that there really were witches.In General, it gave a really and impression of ""witch"" which was a derogatory word that came from the religion ""wicca"". Wicca is not an evil religion. It is a pagan based religion that worships the goddess and demands respect for nature. The boys of ""The Covenant"" were extremely mean to each other, even to the ones they considered there friends. Most of the characters did not have redeeming characteristics. The acting wasn't horrible, but was not even close to outstanding. I would have to say the best part of this movie was the cinematography there were some really pretty shots of a New England background.Not worth seeing",The Covenant
127,starrluna,Run while you can...,1,9 September 2006,"I could tell from the trailer what this was - a male version of The Craft and a teen-centric cheesy horror. So, I went in there expecting that and nothing more. At least I could tell from the trailer that there was eye candy, so I figured that would make up for it.Well folks, even the eye candy can't make up for the 97 minutes of my life I just lost.The acting was some of the worst I have seen and whoever wrote that dialogue ought to be banished from ever putting pen to paper again. I left the theatre deciding I had actually lost IQ points from being subjected to that level of stupidity.The story was nothing new, which was obvious from the trailer. I was at least hoping for some twists to make this somewhat interesting. That was also a disappointment. The movie was so transparent and predictable, there was no fun in watching it unravel.So, when you add up bad acting, bad dialogue, and a predictable plot, you get a moronic movie and my one star rating.In all fairness, I am not the target audience, being a late twenty-something. But I wanted to appreciate it for what it was, and found that to be impossible. I think it's actually an insult to teens to give them that kind of dialogue and predictability and expect them to swallow it. Surely the younger generation has not that hit that level of idiocy....Save your money folks. You work too hard for it to be blown on this garbage.",The Covenant
128,moontiger5,Entertaining yarn with passable special effects,7,13 September 2007,"I watched this film while keeping in mind the comparisons made with another ""supernaturally"" themed movie, ""The Craft"". I must say the two have little in common other than featuring the woes of prep school teenagers in a fantastic setting. ""The Craft"" directly referenced the Neopagan religions, going so far as to depict actual beliefs and practices (albeit bowdlerized to the hilt). ""The Covenant"" does no such thing; it merely retells old New England folklore and urban legends, and features one or two symbols as mere stage props. Other than that it was both funny and painful to watch the interactions of these five adolescents trying to survive the tidal wave of testosterone swamping their systems. Seriously, I recommend it for parents of adolescent males: the special effects do a good job of graphically portraying the inner turmoil typical of that age-group.",The Covenant
129,Tiberius476,Just a Movie Filled with Yummies.,6,20 January 2007,"The movie was pretty good. Four boys descended from witches with really cool powers having fun. Boy meets girl, boy woos girl (with surprisingly little nudity, a fine treat) then a villain puts girl in danger. There are more hotties in this movie than I have seen since Lord of the Rings (I still think Orlando Bloom is the most beautiful man on the planet). The guy who plays Caleb (the sensible one) is as hot a fire cracker (see Sky High he was Warren Peace). The guy who plays Chase (the villain) is almost as hot and is a cheeky bugger. These two are so fine that they had to have fine friends (lookers never hang with dogs in real life or in films). For the men there are a couple of pretty ladies Sarah who like Caleb and some black chick (who of course ends up in the hospital...better than the morgue I guess) so there is something for everyone. There is one really cool car crash scene and the end fight is great. See it...if only to spend 97 mins. with some tissue to keep the drool of the front of your blouse.",The Covenant
130,gladrius,"A decent popcorn flick, a wasted opportunity to be something more",5,16 October 2006,"I hate when a movie makes itself out to be one thing, then ends up being something completely different and considerably lamer. It starts out being about a group of people with great powers that let them move things around with their minds, even play tricks with time, but they age whenever they use them. A great movie could have been made out of that all by itself with the urge to use those powers responsibly or if they even should or not with that downside. But around halfway through the movie the writer seems to have thrown up his hands and said, ""Mr. Executive Man? I don't know how to take this concept any farther,"" and made a plain ol' save the world story the premise of the rest of the movie. If a sequel gets made, it looks like it'll continue down that well-walked path. It's an acceptable movie, but if they hadn't stuck with the boring old ""save the girl, bust the bad guy"" framework, it could've been a great one.",The Covenant
131,niteboon-2,Where were they going with this?,2,14 January 2007,"The story was disjointed, the acting was not of any callibre you can catagorise. More of a serial pilot than an actual movie. I wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it. Whatever it was that made The Lost boys so likable was obviously absent here. Altho it tried hard. Plot hooks were clumsily placed amidst what could have been an episode of dawsons creek with dark clothes, and the story arc was going nowhere soon. Very disappointing for me. The end scenes were special effects driven convenience and how the villain of the story planned his whole scheme.. who was he (or she) trying to kid, talk about naive.

All of the teenage boys in this movie resemble each other so that made for some confusion for me. One thing that is quite redeeming about this film is the way in which a historic Massachusetts town is recreated. The scenes look like what you would think an old Massachusetts town would look like. That adds to the believability of the film. So I would say the film is somewhat visually appealing for this reason. The acting is by no means the worst I have seen. I would say the film is moderately entertaining, despite having a bit of a b-film feeling at times. It kept me somewhat entertained which is all I am asking for when I watch a movie.",The Covenant

That flaw did not hurt the movie any because the constant display of spells and witch craft draws the viewer in distracting you from anything else. It is amusing and will be a favorite among supernatural fans. i liked it over all.And also Steven Straight who's no stranger to having special powers in the film world was convincing as the team leader.",The Covenant
136,allencurl-1,Not another cliché movie,2,18 September 2006,"The plot really doesn't make any sense, the acting is TERRIBLE (though not the worst I have seen), the lines are poorly written, and the only saving quality of this movie is the special effects (which should ordinarily not be the only saving quality in a movie).Okay, there are some scenes in which I want to point out discrepancies. First of all, these kids are suppose to be in high school and yet one of the main characters has tattoos, while they attend a CATHOLIC school. What is with that? Then, the girls sleep in nighties and in their panties each night. What is with that? What are they gonna have a pillow fight next and start making out, I mean, come on that is so lame, it presents the idea of ""Well, we don't have much of a plot, so let's just have sexy characters to make the public not really care either which way if there is a plot or not."" Then, the movie never really explains why the kid (the main character, the nice one who ended up with the blonde chick) runs into the truck and is perfectly fine afterward. HOW COME HE DIDN'T DIE? Okay, next I do not recall any scene where these boys took ANY sort of covenant. It only shows their covenant place (A creepy old cathedral-looking basement place) once through out the entire movie.Second of all, the evil guy ( I don't even remember his name) puts the spell of spiders on the black chick and she goes to the hospital, and when her boyfriend finds out about the spell, he goes out to try to run over the bad guy with his motorcycle (Real smart thinking, right?) Anyway, before he can run the evil character over, his bike flips and he goes smashing down into the pavement and also has to go to the hospital. Well, at the end of the movie, the evil guy dies and the spell is lifted off the black girl, while her boyfriend (the one who gets smashed into the pavement) also gets better. I can understand the girl getting better because she was under a spell and now the person who cast the spell is dead, so the spell is nullified (right?) But I cannot understand why the guy who actually physically crashed his bike and smashed his head into the pavement got better also. That makes no sense.THE MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE!!!

As for The Covenant...I thought it was an interesting movie that most I believe would enjoy. I suggest you rent it or pay-per-view it because it felt to me that it really got a message across.What message do you say? The message that power isn't everything and that some things aren't meant to be taken advantage of.I suggest watching this movie mainly because of it's well put across message and the fact that it does include some action scenes that make you nod your head in the direction of Hollywood.If I were to combine two different movies to make The Covenant...they would have to be: 1) The Matrix.and 2) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Hope you thought this was useful...Talk Later!",The Covenant
138,catbunwars,Painful. Just plain painful to watch.,2,8 September 2006,"Being a fan of the movie Underworld, I thought that I might enjoy this film. Of course, the same director of Underworld wasn't involved, but just one of its executive producers, which nowadays doesn't mean crap (e.g. ""Quentin Tarantino presents Hostel"" or ""Pirates of The Caribbean, a Jerry Bruckheimer production""). So, all you Hot Topic loving teens out there, don't be fooled by the advertisements you see for this movie. I liked Underworld, but it wasn't great, and this isn't half as good. Some may say that a cast of unknowns in lead roles may mean that there's promising new talent to be found here. No. The actors performances were abysmal, wooden at best. And seriously, who wrote the script? The script was about as well written as George W. Bush's speeches. I won't spoil it for you, but if you do go and see this pile of crap, expect to hear some horribly cheesy dialogue, especially one particular line in the last fight scene. Plus the storyline, if anyone really cared to follow it, was about as ridiculous as a blind man driving a bus. I almost decided to go see ""The Descent"" for the second time before the movie began, but I thought to myself ""No. This is an advanced screening.

It reminded me a lot of the old horror movie with Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Feldman the 'Lost Boys', which was also a great movie.

Maybe more details could of come out and we could of learned about the characters pasts in depth instead of just a few minutes of information given in the movie.

143,madisonmoss92,Rich Boys Fight Over Who Gets The Most Power,2,11 August 2018,"I watched this for Sebastian Stan...and honestly that's still most of the reason I would watch it, though I definitely won't pick this one again. His character was the most complex and interesting, and he acted as well as he could with the script given. That's really as far as my compliments go.The concept had SO MUCH potential and the writers scrapped it for Mary Sues and eye candy. I was hoping that maybe they had based it off a book and then done a horrible adaptation, but no, it's just original garbage.Four boys, who are supposed to be like brothers (but have no chemistry at all), are part of a centuries old coven of witches. They began realizing their powers at 13, but at 18 is when they ""ascend"" and become even more powerful because why the heck not, let's roll with it. The problems is that the power is addictive, like a drug, and also their life source. If they ""use"" too much, they age too quickly and die.None of them seem to have any particular moral compass, especially after that beginning party scene. Nevertheless, they are the ""good guys"". They're from old money families too, so they live in nice mansions, have expensive cars, and definitely won't have to work a day in their lives. So they could've been rich brats, but we can't have rich, white male protagonists portrayed realistically, so they're not *really* brats. Except the one Sebastian Stan plays because he's a psychopath addicted to his magical powers and killing people is as simple as kissing his enemies.Caleb, the main character, has NO personality. He only smiles because he's kissing a cute blonde, or because he supposedly said a cheesy line that we expect young, partying teenagers to say. It was so forced! The actor portraying him has a deep voice, which was taken in this film to be ""he's the serious guy, therefore the main character and the hero."" But there is no emotional connection to anything. He honestly could've just played the psychopath and I would maybe have gone with it. His friend, Pogue (old family name I guess? I wouldn't be bothered if there was a good explanation with it), seemed to have a hard time pulling off the jealous type. He was cartoonishly bad. The other two just didn't get enough story time to even be considered real characters. I mean, they were there, but why? They barely contributed to anything at all. Sarah was inconsistent. At times, she came off as bold and fun, thinking outside the box. But this only happened when she was about to show off her sexy side. Whenever there was danger involved, her IQ dropped and so did her balls. I couldn't tell what age group they were actually supposed to be, regardless of the plot telling me they were all 17 years old.Lots of skin. Unnecessary skin. We really needed that shower scene to be dragged out as long as it was. Naked boys in a locker room, plus swimming trunks that look liable to fall of because of they way they are worn. Lots of the lead waking up shirtless and sweating. And what high school girls wear that kind of lingerie to bed on the casual?Caleb's mom is introduced as a drunk, smoking mess. This is made further depressing as she goes on about Caleb and his dad and the misuse of powers, because that's exactly how she welcomes him home every single night I guess. After the drama of the party scene, we get to enjoy that drivel. And then she's later shown to be somewhat caring toward him at the very end, because that's what all mothers do no matter how much of a drunk they might be.I spent the first twenty minutes of this film wondering ""okay, so what's the point of all this?"" and then after a couple weird things happened I had guessed the entire rest of the film. Even down to the anticlimactic fight scene and the underbaked romance.Also, the editing is so strange! It's not even an artistic measure, it's just not well done. Scenes cut at odd moments, they continue onto segments that don't feel connected. Random aerial shots of gothic architecture/scenery, probably just to add screen time because otherwise this film would be relatively short. After Sarah freaks out in the shower and she runs into Reid, why in the world would she - a naked girl in a towel - follow Reid - a stranger she barely talked to at a party - back into the creepy bathroom? And then Reid is obviously not a gentleman because it randomly cuts to them back in the hallway and he just makes an excuse to leave and she's alone in a towel in the hallway at night. Like, yes, drag her back to a creepy place and then leave the poor thing while she's extremely vulnerable, that's exactly what to do. Don't walk her to the door and make sure nothing harms her.Also, there was random drama between some other high school boy who had NO part in the plot whatsoever. He was just annoying, but he wasn't the bad guy, he didn't even make particular problems that moved the plot along. The bar fight was out of place and unnecessary.Chase, the villain, like I said earlier was the most interesting. Only because he is portrayed as such a non-big character in the beginning. He get's introduced, randomly butts into a fight to say a one-liner, and then is played off as a side character until the scene where he discusses the random student who dies (that not one seemed to miss). I could tell the film was trying to draw my attention away. It failed, partially because Sebastian was the reason I was watching, but also because the horrible writing drew my attention to how weird he was being shown in an instant. And while he is scary in the fact that he likes killing, he doesn't do anything else to wreak havoc. He doesn't even get to be a bad boy for a full day before he has a terrible magic fight and disappears into thin air making us all question whether he actually died. There's the hint at the end that he might have lived, but since we have no sequel, we don't care.Dry, dragging on, and devoid of life. Mind-numbing drivel, essentially.",The Covenant
144,D-dogma1490,Awww...it's like they really tried...isn't that cute?,4,1 March 2007,"I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen.The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem witch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called ""The Covenant"". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive. In theory this would make a pretty good action sci-fi movieor at least an interesting teeny flick.But there were just too many glaring downfalls that don't allow this movie to reach its plot's full potential. That acting wasn't good, the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues. For sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job. The movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacing.The movie has it's moments, but overall was a little disappointing.A witchy 4/10",The Covenant

I didn't have a problem with this, but when you watch a film, expecting it to be about four warlocks an it ends up being about the classic, good vs. evil with the pursuit of a hot girl as the subplot, it can disappoint you.The film had a lot of potential, but because of the way it was told it lacked what it needed to turn it into a great film, or even a great cult film.",The Covenant

I agree with the earlier poster who said it was refreshing to see courtship rather than sex in a budding relationship. All the young leads are at least competent, and could go on to bigger careers.

But i got excited since i am a fan of Steven Strait and all the cool supernatural stuff. Recently, these past few years, the endings of these new movies tend to you know... suck. The beginning of covenant caught my eye, and it gave me a shimmer of hope that it would be worth watching. But after fifty minutes, when it was about time for the film to finish, it crashed and burned like a high-jacked plane.First, they totally rushed it for no apparent reason. And then at the climax the screenplay writer scribbled in some gibberish for the hero and villain. The whole barn scene where the main character Steven, takes on the villain guy was total trash. The whole time i watched my mouth was half open, because i could not believe the dialog. Chase, the bad guy, had such corny and stupid dialog that it made me tear up,(not because it was so bad, but because that scene was pretty much him waving his acting career goodbye,). I just really hope he knows how to flip burgers, cuz if he doesn't and the director chooses not to come out with a sequel, he is going to be living off of roman soup for a very long time...Lucklily I am a girl and hot guys in the shower is entertaining to me. As usual i fell in love with every Ispwitch brother,(except the corny villain of course).

The thing with this film is that it is a good idea, just very badly done. There are some hot actors to look at which kept me going through the movie, but it isn't worth while to be honest. They throw around words and terms in their world but they never explain what any of it means. Shame really, thought it was going to be good. So what else to say? Well if you like witchy films, it has some good special effects that did interest me and some spells are quite cool. Its a bit like X-Men, except not as good and they are witches, not x-men, get my drift? Anywhoo, if you want a film that you don't really have to concentrate on, or just want something to make out to, this is the film. Not good but not bad.",The Covenant

There are also three simple love stories based on romance, family, and friends.The special effects were not stunning by any means but they were good and worked for the film. There are few fright moments and definitely an infinite feeling of creepy throughout the movie from beginning to end. The characters are pretty much what you see is what you get. There isn't any character development; but thats OK because the characters arn't the important part of the story- the plot is.THIS IS NOT UNDERWORLD OR HARRY POTTER!. Don't expect something great....its not great. It's good if you like this genre of films.And if the film doesn't appeal to you then at least all the eye-candy will. The girls are hot and the guys are smokin', and there is some brief nudity and some interesting kissage (Not between any couples mind you).I liked it a lot. I had fun. I laughed, got scared, and got turned on. So if you hate the movie at least your libido will be up when you leave the theater.",The Covenant
150,SpookyAtTheDriveIn,Why are most teenagers so dumb?,1,14 January 2007,"It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys. And, yeah, that's it. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually laps us crap films, hated it. It is really stunningly bad, to the extent where it can actually be funny. I would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it. They were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the (really cliché) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end. Watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film. I don't think mainstream, Hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers (or, indeed, for anyone) so I think I'll give up. Unless you're a teen who likes The Pussycat Dolls, thinks Paris Hilton is ""hot"" and watches MTV it's like some sort of wasteland. Life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house. :( P.S. Someone should have told the Director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members ""totally HAWT LOL!!!111!!""",The Covenant

153,Jane_Deaux,This would be better if they were vampires...,5,7 September 2006,"Synopsis: At a New England boarding school, Caleb Danvers and his three friends share a private bond: They are descendants of the original families that settled in Ipswich Colony around the time of the Salem witch trials and have inherited their ancestors' supernatural powers. But their special abilities come at a terrible cost; every time one of the Sons of Ipswich uses his magical powers, he ages prematurely, and the temptation to use the power makes it more addictive than any drug. Caleb's mother is terrified her son won't be able to resist the lure of the potentand addictivepowers. Caleb assures her he can handle his powers, but can he really? And what if he needs his powers to fight an evil force that threatens everything he loves? I saw this movie and was expecting it to be terrible--young actors can be so grating in their inexperience! For most of the cast, I wasn't disappointed (they were pretty bad) but the two main characters--the Good Guy and the Bad Guy--saved the movie for me, but just barely.The worst part (aside from the acting) was that I didn't really understand parts of it. It just wasn't explained well. For example, ""Someone sent me a Darkling."" What the heck is a Darkling? I get the basic idea but are they like spam email? Darklings are referred to several times but never explained. It really seems like the explanation was edited out. There are other confusing moments but, like the Darklings, it's mostly just a distraction and doesn't ruin the whole movie, at least not for me.The reason I give it a FIVE OUT OF TEN is because it was an okay thriller; it met the minimum of my scary-movie list of requirements. It is ""from the producers of Underworld,"" or something like that, and it definitely had that Underworld element of cool. There were lots of attractive people, the magic was neat and the obligatory fight scene at the end was exciting. But through the whole movie, I couldn't help thinking, ""This would be better if they were all vampires...""",The Covenant
154,brandondboucher,Make a covenant to SAVE your money!!!,1,9 September 2006,"Ahhhh, where do I begin? This movie was horrible on SO many levels it baffled me! First off, the acting. The acting was so horrible it reminded me of one of those Saturday morning cartoons where the villain laughs at the protagonist(s) excessively. There's really no way for me to describe it other than say that they might as well have been reading there lines off of a teleprompter throughout the whole movie. As for the dialog, again, all I can really say is that it was purely functional. It was just there to move the plot along so the characters could make it to the end of the film. The directing was also pretty bad, the way it was done made it VERY difficult to suspend my disbelief. For example, at the end of the movie the main character's love interest is floating in a barn, unconscious. The barn ends up getting caught on fire and the whole barn is burning and falling apart and, MIRACULOUSLY, she doesn't get burned at ALL as well as the wood in her immediate vicinity. In summary, the movie has NO DEPTH and once you've seen the preview, you've seen the movie.

155,cothm88,It's good and worth watching,8,28 June 2007,"The first thing we'd expect from the previews of this movie is some lame and cliché movie about witches and warlocks. Fortunately, that's not what we get at all. We get a good suspenseful (almost thriller) in teenage form. And it works! The concept is pretty basic: witchcraft. The style is common nowadays: teenagers. The rest of the movie comes together via those two aspects. The special effects are impressive, and the acting is appropriate. Don't get me wrong, there won't be any Oscars here, but there is solid entertainment value.The plot is meant to be rather predictable and simplistic; however, the focus is on the characters. This is rather unusual since movies tend to focus on an idea, rather than the characters themselves. The result is a pleasant surprise. Clearly, the writers had a thing for arachnids when they wrote the script, and that made a few scenes uncomfortable for me, but there was little to no cheesiness.

This movie is just god awful. The special effects are crappy, the ""actors"" are dreadful, and the ending is a pathetic setup for a sequel that, if the box office is any indication, will not be happening. Also, what's up with all the homo eroticism in this flick? From the guys walking around sweaty and shirtless, to the villain KISSING the hero completely out of the blue, this movie just sucks.

Except maybe Steven Strait's Dad, who was kind of ugly after using all his power. But still... Everyone else was hot! It was fun while it lasted and it was nice to see an American film set in a kind of gloomy, rainy town as opposed to a sunny one in California where everyone has an 'OMG HOTT' Tan. I probably would have enjoyed it more if that Trailer hadn't revealed every single plot twist (So there was only one plot twist... and you would have had to have been a two year old with down syndrome not to figure it out before the characters went 'OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GUY WHO RANDOMLY APPEARED AT OUR SCHOOL WHEN EVERYTHING WEIRD STARTED HAPPENING IS OUR EVIL COUSIN) it's the principle of the thing that bothers me.

162,thelastcritic,Tales From The Horror Genre #1,6,21 February 2010,"""The Covenant"" is the most basic of films, essentially resting much of its effectiveness on the audience's desire to ogle at its stars. Fortunately, the cast is straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue, and the screenplay gives them plenty of opportunities to disrobe, get wet, and strut around. The story plays second fiddle to the finely-tuned abs and strategically-hidden breasts of its cast, but that isn't necessarily a problem since the story is rather uninspired. In fact, one might say that ""The Covenant"" is all style and no substance; they would, certainly, be right. Ultimately, however, the same could be said for a Big Mac and fries, but that doesn't change the fact that, every once in a while, a few empty calories are pretty darn satisfying. Director Renny Harlin understands this simple fact and, though the film does take itself too seriously sometimes, he injects it with a sharp visual style that is aesthetically beautiful and tonally sinister. It might be the junk that most people have claimed it to be, but it is polished, attractive, and fun junk. That, my friends, makes all the difference. Is it a bad film? According to some people's criteria, it probably is. But, that just doesn't seem accurate to me; after all, on many levels, I actually enjoyed it, guilty as I might feel for it.Please read my full review on my blog: www.thelastcritic.blogspot.com",The Covenant

Overall, this film had a great look to it, sleek, hip, and appropriately atmospheric. I loved the story because of the historical slant and the way that it was incorporated in with the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. I recognized a few of the actors from other films, most notably actress Wendy Crewson from ""The Santa Clause"" films, but most of the cast seemed to be relatively new, nevertheless, the characterizations were very good, and I was thoroughly entertained. I've read a few of the other ""user comments"" (ad nauseum), and overall, I disagree with all of the mean-spirited negativity that is aimed at this film. No, this film is not a re-make of ""The Craft"", nor is it similar to the WB's ""Charmed"" or ""Supernatural"" nor is it anything like Joel Schumacher's 1980's classic ""The Lost Boys"" (1987) nor is it similar in tone or look to last year's ""Underworld: Evolution"" or that film's 2003 original for that matter. It is foolish at best to invite such comparisons. I don't know what people want or expect in general when it comes to movies, but surely they must come to terms with the fact that there are no ""original"" stories to tell, in other words, everything is derivative. With that said, a word of caution to those of you who can still think for yourselves and don't need to have everything spelled out, don't listen to the cruel, acid-tongued rantings of the cynical, jaded, pseudo-intellectual few.

The young actors did an excellent job with their intensity of character but the plot still lost something. Maybe there will be a series continuation similar to the Underworld franchise that will explain more of the covenant's background.Steven Strait has definitely grown since the movie Sky High and has a similar intonation to his voice as Ryan Phillipe.

But when a fifth one shows up, stronger than all of them and seeking the power of the others, they must stop him before he kills them and everyone they care about. Think Underworld meets Highlander, and that's the basic mood of the movie. It's easy to think of this as an Underworld knock off, but it was actually better than that. The plot is predictable, and drags at times, and there is almost no character development.

172,dreamlrdmorpheus,I should have known better,1,14 September 2006,"This movie was nothing short of disappointing. I wanted to see it because the trailers made it look like the story could be OK and one of the producers from Underworld was working on it. I really enjoyed both Underworld movies but this was the anti-thesis of Underworld. Were Underworld had a strong female lead this movie is full of rich pretty boys. The closest thing resembling a female lead, Sarah, serves as nothing but a trophy for the ""hero"" Caleb. She is given almost no personality other than having a thing for Caleb and being scared of masses of spiders which, hey, who isn't.As for the action, the only redeemable scenes are in the trailer. The ""big fight"" at the end of the movie was a joke. All the two of them do is throw what look like balls of KY jelly at each other. I would compare this to Dragonball Z but that would be an insult to that over-rated anime. There's never even a drop of blood drawn which for a fight between two super-powered witch boys is ridiculous. Another problem I had with this movie is the obvious undertones of a class struggle. The four rich kids for the most part control the use of their powers. Only Chase who grew up in a lower maybe middle class family turns into a power hungry junkie. The virtually out of place scene of their swimming competition suggests this as well since they make it so that Chase has to use his powers and cheat to be as good as the rich kids at something. Finally we come to the story. What could have been interesting was left dull. They spend two thirds of the movie at status quo with anyone who has seen any trailer for the movie twenty paces ahead of the characters. This is down right boring. Also, the existence of a fifth family of witches and how their bloodline could have continued after the famous witch trials is glossed over in a matter of minutes. Blink and you will miss it. Not that it makes a big difference. All you need to know is golden rich kid versus junkie poor kid and you're good to go. The thing that kept me from walking out was the possibility that the fact Chase and Sarah happened to transfer into this prep school or whatever at the same time wasn't just a handy movie coincidence. Maybe she was Chase's sister or something? Maybe she's just playing Caleb to get to his power? But no. Simple damsel in distress status for her.I'll finish this with ripping the ending a new one. At the end of the lackluster fight Chase gets eaten by a supercharged KY jelly ball and it looks like he's sucked into it before it explodes. Then when firefighters don't find a body Caleb is concerned that Chase is still out there to sick spiders on cute girls everywhere. Hello! You just watched him get eaten by a ball of lubricant and then explode. Something tells me his spell casting days are over. And if not? If they make a sequel?

There's really nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) clean fun. Lots of really attractive actors and actresses. Lots of boys fighting in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects, and/or mindlessly fun plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-worthy, exquisitely-produced film masterpieces with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you probably won't like this film.Using my twisted logic, this movie gets a 4/10.",The Covenant

Yes, it was a bit of a ""teen"" thriller movie, but it wasn't bad. As an action movie it was entertaining, and fun to watch. The characters were played well, the special effects were good, and the story made sense. It wasn't an overly complex story that bogged down, nor was it great writing either, but it made sense the whole time. It was left wide open for a sequel, but with movies now I'm always expecting a sequel, even if the movie sucks. If all you want is an action/thriller story, then try it out. If you are worried about good writing or super-intense story, go watch Crash.",The Covenant

The graphics weren't bad, there were no bloody scenes, no sex, just a fun movie to watch.It isn't hard to understand the plot and easy to follow. The actors are great! I liked Toby Hemingway the best. His acting is amazing.This is a great film to watch with your friends or your family. It's nice for girls to watch, because of the romance between Caleb and Sarah, and for the boys there is the special effects and the fights. I do understand why some people think it's boring, cause there are parts of the movie were nothing happens. But the over-all is very good, and I can really recommend it.",The Covenant
179,jim4146,Not great but worth the watch.,6,7 January 2007,"I did not get a chance to see this film in the theater but being the horror fan that I am and hearing mixed reviews I decided to buy it. While no regrets buying the DVD,here was my problem with the film: The film was nicely produced with all the right elements yet it lacked intensity and at times seemed to drag endlessly.The acting was mediocre but to their credit the lead actors where very charismatic and with proper guidance would have done much better.I fault the director for this and it's a shame since Renny Harlin has directed some really great action/thriller flicks in the past. The film is beautiful to look at with great settings/special affects,the action scenes are entertaining but unfortunately the film did not possess that certain ""oomph"" required for a great thriller and fails to rivet the viewer. Once it was over all I could think was ""What a darn shame that this picture had so much going for it but was goofed up by it's direction."" I'm not certain how well this film did at the box office but hopefully well enough to do a sequel and give the director, actors and viewers a second chance at what should have been a great thriller. Remember ""Mad Max"" and it's superior sequel "" Road Warrior directed by George Miller""? Come on Renny...you can do it! You have the right material. My daughter and wife enjoyed it far more than I did but I suppose it was due to the handsome cast. I don't regret buying it and chances are I will watch it again but no rush anytime soon.",The Covenant
180,patent_pandemonium,What was this movie about?,1,9 January 2007,"From the beginning of this film,with it's ""The Lost boys"" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. ""The Covenant"" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who I am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that. The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. They could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes, however someone decided,(maybe the director, but I don't know if anyone really ""directed"" this movie) that it was going to be filled with some poorly executed ""artsy"" camera shots, and nonsensical scenes of the ""boys"" swimming and getting into bar fights. About half way through this film I thought that maybe bashing my head against a wall would be more entertaining, and partially to rid myself of this horrible dirty feeling I had for continuing to watch it. . So I did bash my head against a wall, and I did enjoy it more then the movie! I watched it all the way to the bitter end, hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment. Nope,my efforts were rewarded with ""How about I make you my Whee-aytch!"" I vomited, and then just felt embarrassment for the screen writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drivel. The acting really wasn't as bad as other reviewers seemed to think, but even the most talented thespian could not saved this work, and work it did, on my nerves! I give movies a chance, even bad ones because they usually offer some form of enjoyment, and this actually wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen. After it was over I did feel like watching the movie ""Stealth"" again and WOW it was so much better this time around! Oh yeah Case in point, don't bother with this movie, really, don't. Watch a few episodes of ""Charmed"", and watch ""The Lost boys"" after having a fair amount of alcohol, and you will be a much better person. If you do fall into the same trap that I did and watch ""The Covenant"", make sure to keep all sharp objects far, far away from yourself, you'll thank me for it.",The Covenant
181,DarkPhoenix77,Pointless,1,11 September 2006,"This movie was the epitome of terrible. I got the sense when it first started that I missed something. It seriously felt like it started in the middle. As the movie progresses certain new elements, of course, are introduced such as the ""darklings"" but they never explain in the movie exactly is the purpose of it. Not only that, but at the point when the Caleb starts to finally tell the story of the witches existence to his lover, Sarah, it's brief. He doesn't really say much of anything. FINALLY at the end the main battle the characters are throwing these ""invisible balls"" at one another. It seemed like the characters were playing supernatural paint-ball. And the coup de grace, the movie ended with no real resolution. This was the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. The only reason I even give it a 1 as opposed to a 0 was because of all the eye candy in it.",The Covenant
182,halfamitten,A terrible TeenieBopper movie.,1,11 September 2006,"This movie was incredibly awful, the story line was so obviously trying to target teens to the point that it hurt, the movie's way of telling the story was also horrible, at one point you knew nothing about the movie, but then the movie revealed itself with no progression, making the ending extremely easy to predict. You also learned almost nothing about one of the four boys.Plus the storyline was horrible, and it got extremely cheesy to the point that it got painful to watch, I desperately wanted to leave the theater, but I was with a group of 5-6.In short, don't watch this movie (it sucked).",The Covenant

They ended up making the movie into a comedy and the movie suffered because of it.If the movie would have had less cheesy lines, it would have been alright. The cinematography and special effects were awesome. The main characters (the teenage boy and girl who were in love) were pretty believable, and I liked them...they are the main reason I gave the movie a 5.Oh, the whole girls sleeping in their underwear/lingerie with each other in the same room when they were in high school is ridiculous...maybe if they would have been in college or something, but no way would they have been doing that in college.The ending leaves a chance for a sequel....ugg I hope not.",The Covenant

I did sit through the entire movie along with the other four people in the theater. My brother was one of the four and this movie has only been out two days.Although the premise could be interesting I guess in another movie, I was, for the most part, pretty bored. The rock soundtrack was incredibly annoying and covered up some of the dialog occasionally. The drunken mother's scenes were laughably bad when they should have been pathetic and sad.One point I found especially confusing. (This is not a spoiler) We know in the movie that the boys have been life-long friends growing up with their families being friends together. I don't remember any of the other three boys' families being mentioned at all.",The Covenant

It turned out that the plot was great and the movie could have been, but it needed some changes. The cast is very good-looking but unfortunately the acting wasn't as good as it could have been. I would give this movie a shot but I wouldn't expect to love it. I have to say that the music in the movie was really good, it really gets you in the mood to keep watching.

If you are looking for a movie that will scare the **** out of, make you go ""oooohh"" or a film you can generally sink your teeth into, this is not the one for you, but if you are 15, or just looking for something quite enjoyable to have on in the background on a Saturday afternoon, or just want to see some half naked hot guys standing around all wet for no reason, this isn't the worst choice you could make. With some classic cringe worthy one-liners such as ""ooooohhhhh witchy"" and ""harry potter can kiss my a**"" The poor young actors try their very best to make this movie good but its generally an awful script, no plot line, predictable all the way through and absolutely no character build up at all. With the four main characters looking like they are straight out of boy band school, the leader, the blonde one, the long haired one and the other one, and the bog standard scene with ""the girl"" wandering around a scary bathroom in just a towel, you have to take this movie for what it is, a teen movie. It's an awful cheese-fest, but regardless of what I've read on other peoples reviews, it does fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category. Enjoyable.",The Covenant

Now that we've cleared that up let's take another look at it and see it for what is supposed to be. A fun movie. There was some action, a very predictable plot twist (not that we haven't all seen that a hundred times), a few laughs, and very attractive, occasionally half naked actors and actresses.I loved the fact that they didn't over analyze the subject matter by launching into a 25 minute explanation about every little 'supernatural' thing, all in all they were fairly self explanatory. Some of the special effects were cheesy, some of the dialog was bad and some of the acting could have been better but, I've seen worse acting from better known actors and worse dialog from good writers. This isn't a movie you wax philosophical about when it's over. It's just an enjoyable hour and a half break from everyday life.",The Covenant

I'm not one of these teenie boppers who only liked it for the hot guys, no I like all sorts of films from art house to American Pie like movies. Even though the actors were not well-known the acting was well put and believable when it came to the environment they were in. I enjoyed the storyline even if at times it kinda left you hanging on a couple of subjects, but according to sources there is going to be a sequel so hopefully they will be fill it in then. The special effects were excellent and they didn't overtake the movie like many films do (aka Underworld, Matrix), and the feel of the film was just a excellent to me.

It seemed just to ramble along without going much of anywhere. I think it could have used some major work. A little more back-story wouldn't have hurt any. It reminded me of a bad episode of Charmed or Buffy. Willow did the whole black eyed with dark power long before this and it was more entertaining then. The Book of Damnation? I guess they couldn't get hold of the Halliwell Book of Shadows. Too bad, it at least has color illustrations and appears to be a more informative read. The whole thing seemed thrown together. Too bad, because the potential for a good movie was there.",The Covenant

I loved how it explained the background and how the girl actually got an answer from the guy without having to threaten to leave him first. The horror elements weren't too scary but they did startle me when I first saw them. It was a short movie so the plot wasn't as extensive as in a longer 2+ hour movie. The actors were good and they worked well together, with good tension between them. Overall I enjoyed the movie and am glad I went and bought it. I will certainly go see other movies with these actors and by these writers and directors.",The Covenant

192,youngwiseandconservative,Better then just hot guys....,9,10 September 2006,"First let me say that I am by no means picky about movies. I think in all of the movies I have watched in my lifetime there are only a dozen or so that I hated and would never watch again. And most of those I only disliked because of vulgarity or tastelessness. Howerever I actually enjoyed the movie, I went to see it thinking it would be an eye candy film, just hot guys, and nothing else but found that I liked it much more then that. I really liked the characters, I think that the actors were well chosen and that they not only fit the parts they played but that they meshed well together which was necessary. I think Sebastian Stan did a terrific job of playing the power hungry bad boy, guys like him make being bad look good. I also like Laura Ramsey, I think shes cute unlike most young actresses these days. It wasn't too scary, and it wasn't too gory, there was hardly any bad language, and there was no rude sex like in most ""teeage"" movies. Its a movie that I will probably go see again and I will definitely buy it when it comes out.",The Covenant

I suggest going to see it at least twice and to pay close attention or you might get confused, many people don't like a movie because they get confused, but many times they just aren't paying attention and so then they don't like it, you have o pay attention to it. it seemed to leave off for a sequel also, i hope that they do make a sequel, and its better written then the first. an overall great movie!",The Covenant

From the hot guys to a really great story line and a cute romance it was overall amazing. The basic storyline is back in 1692 Ipwich Masscusets, a group of five families with mysterious powers formed a covenant of silence. One who just wanted more power was banished and when caught killed. Back to present day, the descendants of the covenant are all gorgeous pre-school boys at the elite Spenser Academy. There's Caleb, the leader who tries to make the others realize the bad that comes with the powers,Pogue, the mediator, Reid, the bad-boy trouble maker, and Tyler, the happy-go lucky follower. With a mysterious new kid in town and a dead guy found after a party secrets begin to unravel that the fifth family's descendant is there, and wants to destroy their covenant.I do admit some parts were a bit choppy but the guys in Speedos made up for that. I especially loved Caleb. He was such a great character who really loved Sarah and would do anything to protect her. not to mention he was gorgeous! I really also loved the idea of the story. It was a really creative idea and they did a great job! They ending was also really good it completed the movie but left it open for a sequel. I am now so obsessed with the movie and i cant wait until it comes out on DVD! both girls and guys can loved it. there's action ,romance, hot guys, spooky scenes, humor, a good story! what more does a movie need! this ain't your typical harry potter!",The Covenant
195,kelland-3,"No plot, but lots of very young beefcake",3,16 September 2006,"The Covenant had more plot in the movie posters than in the actual film. There are some flashes of various books and other words at the beginning that give some hints, but my hopes that the movie would explain the hints or give background on the banished family or specifics of the supernatural / occult themes were all completely dashed. If you want to really know what it going on, you need to pay a lot of attention and read fast when they show pages. On the positive side, if you dislike horror flicks and are really looking for a drama instead, this movie doesn't ever get truly scary. The lead actors are all swimmers with very athletic bodies you see in speedos and some cool trench coats that they swirl fairly well. But if 17 year old beefcake is too young for you, give this one a pass. The target audience seems to be teenage girls with very low expectations for narrative and dialogue.",The Covenant

Apparently they're immortal until they turn eighteen(ah, I remember those days)so no big fight scenes until the end of the movie.Renny Harlin(Cliffhanger, Long Kiss Goodnight)knows how to make things look cool, but that doesn't help the stupid story or the bad acting. Most of the action scenes are quite cool, but even they are hampered by bad dialog and acting.Also, the movie is about a group of guys with witch powers, but you don't see them all fighting in the end. That might have been cool. Now we just have too many characters in one movie that won't die.Something that really annoyed me was all the moody sounds and music.

At first it is hard to fully understand what is going on, but once I thought about the plot I was able to grasp it. There were some parts that were just like other movies of that genre; I thought the twists were in some ways predictable, but then there were other parts like in the locker room that the person you thought was responsible turned out to be completely innocent. The ending was relatively predictable in that the dad would surrender his power to his son to help save the day and get rid of the family that should have been forgotten many years before.",The Covenant
198,ispeakmumblese,Gah!,2,25 November 2006,"I went into the movie theater with medium expectations. I thought, upon seeing the trailer for the first time, that it was definitely worth seeing. However, after endless publicity through Myspace (directed at teenagers...not a good sign), I slowly began to think, ""Eh, it'll be something to pass the time."" And I was right.This movie was pretty much just typical teenage fluff. The plot was very predictable, and 99% of the cast were hired for their pretty faces, not their acting skills. And can you say ""fan service?"" (An anime term, but it definitely applies for this movie.) The scene with Sarah in the shower hardly needed to take place there. It could have happened anywhere else and been just as effective. And the fact that every member of the Sons of Ipswitch was on the swim team. In Massachusetts, of all the cold, blustery places. Merely another chance to show off the young (and very much in shape) male cast. As a girl, I can appreciate this, but was it necessary? Hardly.There was also the issue of the high-adrenaline, high-decibel soundtrack. It really took away from any maturity the movie might have had. And as for the opening titles, it looked like something straight out of television. I'd be willing to bet that either the director or producer (or possibly both) had only previously worked on t.v. shows and not movies made for the big screen.And the special effects? Well, during the fight scenes it looked like they were all having battles with powers that manifested itself in the form of big, menacing...bubbles? Sad.

I especially think considering the newness of the cast, they did an awesome job. If you paid attention at the beginning of the movie, and followed along closely, the whole thing fell into place and made perfect sense!

They should have titled this movie the Assention, because it really has nothing to do with the covenant, since most the members of the covenant have tiny roles in the movie. If the writers of this movie wouldn't have ruined it by adding the girl, and explained the story a bit better, and hadn't made the ""bad guy"" so over the top, then this movie could have been the next Lost Boys, but they ruined it.

There is more than enough action but it is used in such a that manner it doesn't dominate the whole movie with the cost of the actual story.The minor downfall this movie has is the studio imposed PG13 rating, not that it makes this movie bad but for more mature audiences something a bit more dark would have made this movie truly great.It surely wont be up for Oscars but it's a good movie that aims, and succeeds in it, for your entertainment.

Ya know - high school drama, hot guys, mystery, magic, scary stuff; what more can you ask for? Sadly, the idea definitely isn't pulled out in the best possible way. The movie looks more like a draft/summary of what it should have been. Not enough story, not enough character development, not enough... SENSE overall :D . As for the acting, yeah, it wasn't superb, but it was decent enough for me to think that the guys aren't bad actors IN PRINCIPLE :) .

207,nofaultofmine,Exactly what it promises to be,9,27 February 2007,"I wanted to see this movie at the cinema because I had seen the poster for it and was pretty much like ""Oooh hot guys, I'm there"". But having finally seen it on DVD I think that there is more to the movie then that. First up lets get things straight, if you want to be challenged intellectually or see a movie that is likely to get an Oscar you are going to hate this. However this movie has a somewhat reasonably plausible plot and the acting is decent. A lot of these guys are first timers- and lets face it, the first thing you do isn't going to be mind blowing since you don't have the options.The Covenant is a film about warlocks and a group of them that have remained together (The bloodline, not literally them) since the Salem witch trials in the 1700's. And it's exactly that. There was a few times where I thought I could see the plot coming- and although the ending is quite clichéd- what came before wasn't. The guys are all hot (Although I do feel sorry for the character of Tyler as he seems to be 'The Fourth Guy' and probably had the same amount of lines in the movie as fingers on my hand) and the fact they take their shirts off adds to the movie.Personally I liked this. It wasn't as predictable as I had first imagined, and it's meant to be a teen horror, and for the genre, it's a good one!",The Covenant
208,grayfox892000,Good Film,7,9 September 2006,"I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say that it was amazing. It's not your typical thriller/horror/suspense flick, but it's well worth watching. It was the kind of movie that a guy could bring his girlfriend to and she could say that she actually enjoyed it. There's no gore in it but it does have the ""jumpy"" sequences. Overall the acting was a little cheesy and the dialog wasn't up to par but it was very entertaining. For all the females out there, there are quite a few handsome guys in this movie, and for the men, well, you should enjoy it. The action sequences in the movie were amazing, in my personal opinion. The horror sequences in the movie, well, if you're afraid of spiders, then I suggest that you be prepared for quite a few. I would compare this movie to ""The Lost Boys"" it's the kind of teen age movie that people can enjoy for years to come. Personally, I don't agree with critiques, and I don't think anyone should. So if you go by the critiques ratings of this film, you might be turned away from it. But then again, if you are smart and you saw ""lady in the water"" and loved it and compared it to it's rating and reviews and was completely appalled, then you will love this movie.7/10 stars.",The Covenant
209,sanchobizz,Male witches running wild,7,18 March 2013,"The Covenant movie was like every other urban legend movie that was made before. It had its mystic creature's (in this case male witches). There was the hot damsel in distress (Laura Ramsey), and it had the lost mystic group member that went stray, now he returned to make trouble.Like every other teenage movie it had a lot of pretty boys and girls  actually there were only 1.5 hot girls (the blond was a looker while the other one was nothing special). Those boys and girls supposed to be college students but all they do is party all night, swim in their college team, use their powers to show off, fight between themselves and try to stay awake during their classes. That is strange, from what I remember of my college years I had to work really hard and I didn't had a spare minute to waste. I guess the boys and girls from The Covenant are gifted and everything comes easy for them.The acting from most of the participants was OK, the Covenant's cast has nothing to brag about, their performance was tolerable.The action and special effects were below average. The guys through invisible balls that supposedly blew up and caused fires, they could do so much better than that. Is it so hard to create a fire ball in CGI or make them through huge stones. Everything is better than an invisible ball of jellyfish they used all the time.Although the special effects sucked in the Covenant, the visual scenes and the way the movie was shot was very well done. Renny Harlin managed to bring classic Europe to The Covenant. The castles with the beautiful landscapes made the viewing experience better than expected.Overall this movie was average. I didn't follow most of the plot because when i was watching the movie i was exhausted from a long day at work, i was on neutral smeared on my chair. The only reason that the covenant can be considered as a cool movie is the fact that I wasn't my 100% watching it. If you are really tired (like i was) or really drunk like i wished to be, you will enjoy the Covenant.for more cool review check out - http://www.coolreviewsrule.com",The Covenant

212,mcdadi2000,Another version of the Ipswitch anthology,8,19 February 2007,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see another story beside every day witch and wenches. Acting I could say is better than average from most of the actors (not for everyone sadly). There are some good special effects in there but we are in 21th century, they must be that way... many movies prove otherwise thou. I must say I enjoy it and I recommend it mostly to science fiction and horror fans. It's a good combination between those two. The story is catchy and it goes smoothly till the end. The end is somewhat stretched but well, not everything goes smooth from the beginning... waiting for the sequel that can have bad or hopefully, improved and elaborated story.",The Covenant
213,frozen_glee,An introduction of talented young actors to the movie audience.,8,11 September 2006,"Before commenting on the acting,the effects etc. I think it's more important to understand the behavior of the characters. I've read many comments about this movie in various websites and many of them mentioned poor fighting scenes,even poorer acting and all. Let's start from the very beginning:The main characters are the youngest of the four (in)famous families that survived the witch trials of Ipswich.What's more,is that even though almost everyone knows this,it only remains an accessory mystery fact to four super gorgeous close friends.But they actually have supernatural powers.Now where they live,people may not care anymore about the past of the family but mind you,the families seem to care a lot about hiding their past and their present abilities. So now imagine four guys between ages 17-19.At that age,they have to act normal and yet they must have to hide their actual identity,while from time to time they use those abilities to have fun. I think all of them carried out their characters pretty well. Plus,think about it-in a group of close friends,there is always a quiet one,a trouble maker-player,a jealous-aggressive one and a calm-responsible-mature one.That's what they did and did it well. Coming to the fighting scenes:in the back of the bar scene,we see for the first time what it looks like when angry covenant boys use their 'powers' and at first it made me think of a super-amazing fighting scene between the bad guy and the responsible-mature guy,but it turned out to be a disappointment.I mean,seriously-if you had supernatural powers wouldn't you think of setting your opponent's rear on fire or trying to take all the air out of his lungs?All I saw was a fantasized dodge ball fight with transparent balls of energy. Also,I think it would be better if there were more suspicion about the '5th' guy-it seemed as if they reached the conclusion too fast. Speaking of the female characters:Wouldn't any one of you out there be a little more startled when you saw your boyfriend's father who's supposedly 44 but looked like a hundred?And it seemed the girl and the guy got close too soon. Overall,if the story was distributed on a longer period of time (from July till December for example) there would be more suspicion set up,more thrills,more curiosity and more surprises.We would also see a gradual development in relationships which would make more sense. Still I enjoyed the movie.This I think is the 'introduction' movie for the main characters we saw,meaning they'll be on the screen in the coming years and they have a lot of potential.",The Covenant
214,old_fluffy_possum002,I very nearly killed myself,2,12 November 2006,"I will begin by saying that I went to see this movie with a friend of mine who is quite into cults and Gothic horror and all of that. Just by looking at the movie poster, I could see that it was most probably going to be lame. I was right.The film starts with bleary heavy metal music and pictures of pentagrams all over the place... and all of a sudden we see a group of guys standing at a cliff, looking something like a darker version of the Backstreet Boys or NSYNC. Anyone agree that this sounds like crap yet? The dialogue was so awfully cheesy. The film was basically all visual effects and it seemed like the screenwriter had just put in words to cover up the CGI-less scenes. Some of the lines that told me that made me increase my dislike of this film were: ""Harry Potter can kiss my ass."" ""Come to find Miss Muffet have we."" And the best for last ""I just saw... A DARKLING."" The acting wasn't much better. Both the actors and actresses were woody and there characters underdeveloped and stupid (I mean, when I light bulb explodes in a creepy bathroom, no idiot would walk around in a towel trying to find out why.) In my opinion, in some way or another, the director must have known he had just created a piece of crap, because, probably just to get more people to want to see it, he made the actors either topless or in a tank top with ""steroid"" type muscles sticking out... AND they were almost constantly drenched in sweat.All in all, don't waste your money. This is meaningless and pathetic porn. It was painful to sit through and seemed to drag on forever like a hurt donkey. Within five minuets of walking out the movie house, I'd forgotten all about it.",The Covenant

So what about this film? Warlocks, that's different. Points for originality, it wasn't completely cookie cutter, and if you haven't noticed no one's thought of something themselves in a while now... The acting varied... some actors I likes, others sucked a lot of grade A eggs. Typical dumb girl pulling the typical dumb girl in flick moves... but can we get past that? This is not a character driven film, they tried to make it one, but unless you want another hour of film there's no way they could have pulled it off. SO, don't look too deeply in. Stay on the plot and the story itself. It had all the classic themes to my dismay. Boy meets girl, there's problems cant be with girl. Family problems cant go home. And of course the psycho guy from a similar background who wants to make life even more difficult for the protagonist because he's power hungry, arrogant, stupid, etc. take your pick. No it's not that bloody amazing. But it was entertaining and I enjoyed myself despite what it was lacking. If you disagree, oh well, you're entitled to your opinion all in all I give it a 5 for being okay with not much for story and 1 more for the more original details.",The Covenant

I pretty much figured out what was going to happen within the first oh, 15 or 20 minutes or so. The dialoge was cheesy and made me groan in a few places. The special effects were okay, but nothing better than what one would see on TV. The saving grace of the movie are the hotties that run around without clothes. That made the movie for me. It was also filmed in a very lovely area, so that also helped decrapify the flick. Let's put it this way, the movie can be watched without the sound on and it would be equally, if not more entertaining than watching it with the sound on. (spoilers below)There were questions left wide open..like...what the hell was going on with 'The Darkling'. If Chase didn't bite it in the end, as was hinted at by the lack of a body, why did all the folks he cursed suddenly get all better?(end spoiler)So, for dialoge, plot and the like I give it 3 starss.

I didn't see that they said they were Warlocks as that is not a term belonging to witchcraft but that certain family-lines had special powers. The eldest son of each family-line generation had the powers and at age 18 they would ascend gaining all their powers. If they abused their powers, as it became addicting it would take life force energy from them and they would prematurely age. I liked this movie and felt that either people would dislike it a lot of really love it without too many in the middle. They only had a basic 2 hour block to develop the movie so it would have been difficult to go too deeply into everyone's background and achieve at least what they did in the time alloted. I thought the premise was really interesting and that it didn't go into some Satanic take off with it. Special effects were awesome.They were trying to show that responsible use of their powers were what they were striving for. Also they showed them as typical young men who liked to have fun, fight and pull practical jokes. I thought for once they made a movie with good looking young men and not just the women. In this one the men were more attractive than the females...that alone was worth the watch to me. The ending did look like they were going for a sequel.",The Covenant

First half I was curious but then second half turned out to be everything as expected. No suspense no thriller. It's a high school kids' movie. It probably could have been made better.It lit some curiosity in the first half. The whole witch thing caught my attention. The actress is cute. She did fairly well and one dance scene was nice.

226,chici87,"5 powerful witches, 1 evil bastard trying to steal from the others",10,9 September 2006,"OK, the movie was a super action flick. The acting was pretty good, minus the lead girl, she was irritating and not such a great actress. The guys were totally hot! The special effects were sweet, but a couple of scenes looked like they were taken from Underworld. The plot was good, but could have been expanded a bit to incorporate more of the characters. That was the biggest disappointment for me, so I'm kind of hoping for a sequel to bring out the other characters a bit more because the movie was mostly focused on Caleb instead of the whole group. Good film. If you liked Underworld, you'll most likely enjoy this one. I'd definitely go see it again in theatres.",The Covenant
227,NYsinger14,Very Good Until The End,8,25 July 2007,"The Covenant was pretty good to me. It contain little bits of comedy with Reid Garwin being the obnoxious, reckless bastard. Then you had Caleb Danvers which would be you're normal male hero with charm and good looks. The acting was pretty good considering the fact that none of these actors were over the age of thirty and if they were, they were extras like the cops or the teachers.The stunt work was excellent and CGI effects were believable in a sense to create a whole new word that nobody knows about or has seen. Since the same people who produced Underworld and Underworld Evolution produced this movie, it clear that this is similar to each other in many ways. You would have to not compare it by acting talents and the fact that one speaks of an unspeakable power and the other brings together the most dominant in scary movies, blood sucking vampires and blood feasting werewolves. You would have to focus on the story surrounding the important things. In this they connected history to the future but did not go into very much detail about the history. It also surrounded darkness and even if light was in certain scenes, the place looked equally creepy as it made the place look spooky in a sense of the outer surroundings. The action was also brought in different ways as to crashing cars and jumping off of cliffs.The only problem I had with this movie is the ending fight between Caleb Danvers and the evil 'Chase Collins.' I mean, you watch this movie from the beginning and never take you're eyes away, you then can't wait until the ending fight. But as you sit there watching them use the amazing powers you tend to often wait for a time when they use the power at an amazing length but this never comes. Sitting there and watching it and then being disappointed in the end fight is not what I called for.I'm a teenager, and sometimes some adults have a tendency to not broaden their minds as to understand what was so good about the movie. As adolescent, when told this was an action/horror flick and was produced by Underworld, it hyped us up to see it. So, we have a tendency to watch the movie only comparing the tad bits to Underworld and actually making the connections. Something we were blessed with. Yeah Right! I do recommend watching the movie but a little heads up, don't pay attention to the ending at all and then when the fight is finally over tell me what you think. Because in my mind, I could have written a better ending fight. And directed it. And produced it. And any other thing that is taking a part of this movie.",The Covenant

The plot does take a little while to develop but I didn't think it was too long. It was worth the wait! The plot was pretty interesting and the girls are pretty too so the guys have something to look at. The movie is a little predictable and I kind of wanted to see the other 3 Covenant guys a little more. You kind of except them to work together but they really don't.

229,mxarod,new level of suck to the quasi scary movie. *(elements more than spoilers)*,3,9 September 2006,"let me say first off I didn't go in expecting much, and watching it at prime-time on opening night should have helped. I believe it would have, had there been more than 20 people in the theater. It sucked so hard. the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. I guess that was their way of twisting the plot; keep everyone in the dark on crucial info to understand the movies direction until the end and THEN explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plot.Unknowns until the end of the movie: -What the Eff is a dark-ling? the CG was cool but I want to understand! -why cant powers be willed? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. -why is willing away powers so bad? your just normal after, right? -who farted?roughly 50% of the minutes with just men on screen, were shots of them in wife beaters, sleeveless t's and then a gut wrenching pool scene of all teenage men in the skimpiest low riding speedos knowing to ever have been manufactured. I swear you could see the start of the one guys.... well, it was close to soft-core. And of course there was a shower scene, and to mix it up it was of the DUDES. Butt cracks were abundant, a sausage fest in progress. But there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she ambles around the best looking dorm bathroom for around 12 minutes. Then there was a girl talk PJ party. the other thing I couldn't get over was the amount of driving that Caleb did in his SUPER COOL ford mustang GT. it was a ford commercial for around 1/4th of the movie.Don't see it. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it could be worth it. but don't expect anything breathtaking.",The Covenant

I would recommend it to anyone that has wanted to see it. I thought that the choices in actors and actresses also fit well. I am tired of seeing the same faces in all of the same movies, so I loved seeing a whole new crew. It also had GREAT action scenes. I think they did a good job of setting up scenes and action shots.

When you watch the previews to the movie you think you will see four families sticking together to save what they kept secret for all these years. So if they do make another movie maybe they focus on all of the families and their powers instead of just one guy against another.

Also, one of the group members/allies of the hero was the classic ""rebel boy"" and was abusing his power, which made the viewer think he would be trouble later on, or on the bad guy's side. But as soon as the real threat showed up, he suddenly faded into the background and conveniently stopped causing trouble.The characters were lifeless and sounded dumb. It was like they found a bunch of underwear models and gave them scripts.also, during the big action scene in the end, I could hear the same sounds being used over and over.They also hinted at a sequel because they couldn't find the body of the defeated villain but I felt no excitement for it whatsoever.The best part was all the effects. The fights scene was very cool and realistic in the sense that after a blow they didn't just hop right back up again. There was obviously a struggle for both parties. Also during the action scenes, the actors seemed to really come to life and actually act.

I saw it because i wanted to see an action movie with hot people that may have scary parts. Thats it. But thats also what I got. I was not wowed, but i wasn't let down either. I saw it with a group of friends because thats the type of movie it is. The ending also left a little open for a sequel, especially when they say, ""we found no body in there.""

If you expected to see some really kick ass movie, then you really have no idea about movies, because the trailers were very cliché of this sort of movie-they showed the best parts and that was it.

I'm not saying it was amazing, but I'm also not saying it sucked. It was a good movie with some high and low points.

I don't want to spoil it, but I checked the spoiled box so that I could tell you my favorite part(even though it's not important to the plot)...In the beginning, they are driving away from the cops, and they decide to ramp their car off of a cliff. Reid (played by Toby Hemingway, who I was just thinking looks an awful lot like Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfoy) is driving, and as he's going off the edge, he yells 'Harry Potter can kiss my a--!' The plot line was pretty good, but some things were left completely unexplained (like what the heck was up with the ghosty dead kid?), and they spent a lot of time on making us all aware that certain characters were rebellious, and others were more reserved and mature. I wish it would've gone more in-depth about their powers, and where they came from, and exactly what they could do.I didn't care much for the 'love interest' Sarah, and her character does do some pretty dumb-blonde things, but I'll concede that she was helpful to the plot.And they left it completely open for a sequel, which was kinda good, cause if they made a sequel, I'd go see it, but kinda bad, because it leaves the end a little loose.All in all, I thought it was great, and I gave it a 9 of 10 just for not explaining certain things well enough.",The Covenant
240,refrain5,What happened to the plot?,5,11 September 2006,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the movie showed potential, and yes that is all you are presented with. There is little reason to go into this movie unless you are expecting to see beautiful actors or less flashy matrix action.The first half of the film actually had me going. You have a mysterious band of 4 witch brothers with an internal rivalry and a possible traitor. Someone is using their powers to torment them... but who? And more importantly, why? ...it's a 5th witch who wants more power. Wow. The movie simply fails to drive the plot any further.Not only is the rivalry between Caleb and Reid not elaborated upon, it and Reid's bitterness towards Caleb are completely expunged by the second half of the film with no apparent settlement between them. The villain's attempts to torment and scare Caleb, Pogue, Sara, and Kate serve him little to no purpose. In fact, why are there even 4 witch brothers in the movie? Even a minor character like Sara's friend Kate had more screen time than 4th witch boy Tyler Sims.At least I'll give the actors and the film credit for looking good. I can't believe I had this much to write about such a cheesy movie. Maybe it's because I kept expecting something more from it.",The Covenant

The action sequences were awesome and so were the special effects.

And the plot line was pretty well thought out.. there weren't many holes like most crappy occult teen movies. All in all, the effects were awesome, the fight scenes were better than the effects, and the boys are amazingly gorgeous (especially the angry blond one). The romance was a little cheezy, and towards the end it seemed like the writers weren't really trying as hard as the first 2/3 of the movie, but it was still pretty awesome. Definitely see it if you liked Buffy or Underworld or such. And we should all beg for a sequel.

If you like movies like Harry Potter... Well this is probably your sort of movie... Funny, but filled with action. Then of course there's the whole magic part! Only a little scary, in a few select parts. Where it seems like it's gonna be scary (mostly you can tell from the music, it gets creepy), it's really not. The scariest parts are only a few seconds long. This was a VERY excellent film, not exactly fit for the younger audiences...

248,pierrex,Reminds me of some Uwe Boll films...,1,9 September 2006,"I am not even sure where to begin... so I will start with this... In 15 years of going to the movies that I have paid for with my own money there has been only one I walked out of; this is now the second. This film does not start anywhere, does not go anywhere, is not suspenseful, is not scary, elicits neither sympathy or empathy for the protagonists nor disdain for the antagonist and has some of the most poorly written dialogue in film to date. This film suffers from the script supervisor (responsible for continuity) being asleep in a lot of the scenes making the flow of the film abysmal. This film has randomly placed scenes which try to tie motivations between characters and events through out the film when very little foundation has been laid for anything that happens; everything seems forced and artificial. Most people will read this and say: ""You did not stay to the end so how can you comment on a film you walked out of."" Here is my reason: This film did such a poor job of getting me to care about anything it presented in terms of story, dialogue and characters I just could not take its mediocrity anymore. I tried and I think I made it with 15 minutes or so to spare. By that time I was so disinterested in what happens seeing the ending to the film would have made no difference; it would have only served to make me more upset that I stayed to watch this... this... train-wreck to its conclusion. I cannot even chalk this one up to entertainment value because I was not entertained in the least bit. Not even the girl-candy (and they are hot) was enough to keep me in my seat. As a friend once told me ""...you would have been equally served by taking the money you spent and setting it on fire and watching it burn."" In this case he is completely correct.",The Covenant
249,zopheus,Warning! Brain cells at risk.,1,9 September 2006,"I think the makers of this movie must have had a cliché dictionary handy when writing this horrible movie. Not only was the plot predictable, the acting sub-par, but the whole concept behind the movie had absolutely no point.If you enjoy watching totally unrealistic stereotypical versions of real teenagers with the emotional IQ of a 2 year old run around moving things with their minds, this is the movie for you! Otherwise don't go near this movie even if someone gives you free tickets.At least I only paid for a matinée show, but even that was too much! Note to the casting department: Never cast the hero and the villain so that they look almost identical in the dark unless they are supposed to be twins. How in the world are you supposed to tell who is winning? Answer: It's a cheesy kiddy horror flick with a predictable ending...BAD BAD BAD",The Covenant

This movie was full of blunt beginnings and endings, a bland storyline, with very little action to be called an action movie, and a very guessable plot and ending. There were a couple of pointless scenes, a couple of pointless characters, and a lot of guy's rear ends, that i did not want to see. Those scenes only being added in the movie, only to create some revenue from girls/women who only want to see ""such scenes"". The same is for the men as well...in ""particular"" scenes. I went to see an action movie, and i wanted to see action, not some scenes with naked men...And i didn't even see much action in the movie...Half of the people with the ""powers"" didn't even use them! The only fight seen was the end fight scene, and I am glad that it had decent action, or the throwing of popcorn at the screen would of commenced.Over all...a very poor..maybe even cheap budgeted movie, with no-name actors, bland storyline, and a easily guessable plot.

However, from the trailer, I made a guess as to the general quality of the film. I was right, and I enjoyed myself.Hot guys who do magic. That's pretty much all you need to know about the movie. The dialogue is crap, most of the acting is so-so, characters are woefully underdeveloped, and the plot is flimsy at best. That said, it was a fun movie. There was exciting action, and lots of fan service for the girls in the audience (Don't worry boys, there are girls in dubious sleepwear, too) It's one of those movies where you sit and watch and say, ""This is a really good idea, but even *I* could write a better movie than this.""

That and i realized that it was like a WB show, the actors, the plot line, the ""teenage"" actors(who really looked like they were in college-that and the plot line could have been better if they were in college). Last thing that ill talk about without going into details was the fact that there was not nearly enough action as the previews suggested.

253,SilverPhoenixJMP,MmmmHmmmm,9,9 September 2006,"What can I say about this movie? Of course I liked it...but most people apparently found it completely dreadful. Some have described this as an ""Action Chick Flick"" well that is true in a sense, while on the other hand, everyone can get something out of this movie (male or female).For those of the female prospective you will find some gorgeous men with their shirts off and did I mention some of their bootys? How can you not enjoy that? For the men, there is some action and some jumpy parts to it that can please you but probably wont make you goo goo over it. Oo..and some pajama times with the girls that really make you want to yell 'lets have a pillow fight' For the most part, it is a male version of the craft only with 5 instead of 3. 4 males deal with their powers and the problems with using them before a strange new guy comes to town and turns out to be the 5th of the long line of settlers of the town. Action and some nudity makes it a rather good show.On the bad part we see some gaps. They talk about a Dark Ling but never explain what it is but those who are able can tell what it is from the story line itself. Other than that, it seemed slightly predictable and yet it wasn't.For the scary part we see spiders and other creatures. Sometimes you know whats going to happen and then...nothing happens. Don't be fooled...thats when something pops out at you...(accompanied with some dramatically scary music) The soundtrack will most definitely be a must buy. Rock music covers the movie and at the beginning you really want to head bang.Overall you need to watch this movie with an open mind. You may not like it well that is your problem but to others it is great. You can find something for everyone...from some hot people to action to the music played...and of course those of you who like to jump in movie theaters at those scary parts.I gave this movie a 9/10 because i really did enjoy watching it but of course it wasn't perfect.

It went beyond my expectations (which may not be saying much, but still). The acting wasn't the greatest, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I'm not a fan of horror flicks AT ALL, and I was glad to see that there weren't any real ""horror"" sequences. And for all you girls out there, it is filled with eye-candy.

So I saw it on opening night and there were all of 22 people in the theater including me and my friend. With the inexplicable amounts of skin shown it is clear that the movie is geared towards teens. And for a teen movie it delivered, I mean it had a hot cast of models, a cool idea behind it, and a little romance. That said, the plot has its fair share of problems, and at times doesn't make since or you have to wait it out. Questiosn raised- How is Caleb able to fend off an already ascended witch (plus his fathers powers) before he himself ascends?If they took a covenant of silence, why are they so reckless? i.e. landing a car on a cliff in front of plain sight of others?Why didn't they all just band together and fight Chase? It honestly would have been potentially cool, and made more sense, since his powers should have been unstoppable.All in all, see with a friend you can have a good laugh with and joke about the problems.

The story line is a little choppy at times and the rolls are a bit stereotyped; Strait as the good guy who is older and knows more, Reid (Toby Hemingway)as the bad boy rebel of the group, and the other 2 as the middle men. Chase comes in as the villain and Caleb's sudo-gf as the damsel in distress. SPOILER what got me at the end is his friends cant find the girl at the dance and don't run to help Calib, the ending leaves off with no real feeling of 'its over' and your left with a feeling of ""ummm OK"". It was a good movie, but they could have done more with it. Oh and I think it is a click flick and a guy movie. You do get the hot guys in there for the girls, but you also get a girl shower scene and they walk around in undies a lot. So i wouldn't call it a chick flick since it has both.",The Covenant

Characters are poorly developed. One of the witches barely had a line, just standing in scene after scene with his buddies.Lots of interesting ideas are never explained. Like in other reviews, the ""darkling"" concept comes into play several times, but never gets discussed... so why bother? I still don't understand why the ""bad"" witch is so upset with the four ""good"" witches. Maybe I missed it. What exactly did the great granddaddy daddy do to earn his nasty fate? Who came up with the concept of jumping and levitating off a cliff through a foggy void? Oh, I know, the director of The Lost Boys.I was hoping that the ending would contain something redeeming to validate the ticket price, but this stinker was bad to the end.

Some of the effects were nice, but when your big Mage Duel, the supposed high point of the film, is two 18 year olds throwing balls of mystical-energy-goo at each other, you need better writers.Honestly, the acting was crap, the dialogue was worse, and the major villain was a whiner of an 18 year old who never got enough love growing up, and is angsting all over the place because of it.I didn't see ""Underworld"", but this was the supposed equivalent for White Wolf's ""Mage: THe Ascension"".

I see Steven Strait as the next big thing. He can really go far in my eyes. He possesses that sort of raw talent that I old actors like James Dean possessed. It isn't to bad to look at either. I have always enjoyed movies that involve witch craft and things of that sort. This movie is definitely in my top 3. I'm hoping there will be a sequel.

262,pfs216,Pretty much an overall disappointment...,4,18 September 2006,"...although there were good thematic elements and all-around kick-ass special effects. However, like most over-Hollywood-ized movies these days, ""The Covenant"" falls victim to plot pitfalls, oversights, and general confusion. It looks like the masterminds behind the film stumbled across a passably interesting plot and scrambled to industrialize it into a 1 hour and forty-minute bundle that the majority of moviegoers could easily swallow. It would have been better with a bit more history, much more exposition and set-up, and significantly better writing and acting. The basic plot of ""The Covenant"" goes back to the days of witchcraft persecution in the mid-1600s. The 5 families of Ipswich make a pact (or covenant) to keep their secret powers under wraps, but one family lusts for more, is banished and ultimately disappears. Fast-forward to modern times, and four teenagers (too pretty-boy-ish for their own good) have kept the covenant. But someone has been using the power, unbeknownst to the other 4, resulting in freaky, phantom-like apparitions that are never fully explained (perhaps just thrown in for shock value? It works). Needless to say, the fifth wheel (and culprit) is identifiable about 3 minutes into the movie, effectively shutting down the sleuthing. The rest of the movie is pretty much straight-up butt-kicking (supernatural-style), one aspect in which the movie is fairly strong. But again, little details (make-up effects that aren't visible in later shots; wounds that mysteriously disappear) call for significant suspension of disbelief. Enjoy the movie as the mindless, tame creature that it is.",The Covenant
263,wickedvamp06,great,10,23 September 2006,this was the greatest movie i've seen in a while. it was perfect in every way and to have someone with that great of a smile (caleb) is all points positive as well! and like i said before it's great and the dialog and the action in it was at top natch as well. i really enjoyed it and that it definitely a movie I'll watch repeatedly. to have seen this movie with my friends was also a blast. we commented on things through out the movie and it made the experience all the more appealing. heck my niece who is only two years old actually sat on either a lap in a chair or stood holding onto the back of chairs and watched the movie. she never stops to watch a movie so it must have been terrific if she did that. we were all shocked when we saw her actually watching the movie. great movie nd i can't wait to see if there will be another one. truly superb!,The Covenant
264,oneato183,1 is a perfect score.,1,23 September 2006,"OK...before I even start the more or less constructive criticism of the movie I'd like to say a few words which come from the heart... THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!! DON'T GO TO SEE IT UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE SWEATY BOY-BANDS AND WOODEN-ACTING, NO-PLOT STORIES.. So, let's go to why I think the movie is so bad: 1. There is not story line. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasn't there. 2. The whole thing looks like a big, hour and a half promotion for some kind of goth-wanna-be-but-still-looking-like-""BSB""-band... All guys in school have perfect abs, no fat or ugly young people... there is no good looking girl in the movie as well, not one. The main character is either wet in the swimming pool, or all sweaty in his bed... poor guy. Must be awful to go on a date sweating like that. 3. Can those guys do something good with their powers? Anything good? Like put off the fire in that old barn or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing of in front of each other. 4. Wooden acting. The main character only has two expressions on his face. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: trying to look seductive but still seems sad... In that boy band there are 4 guys: The main characted, his best friend who got into the accident, the blondy, and the fourth one... what was the name of the fourth one? I think he only spoke twice throughout the whole film: once in the beginning ( he said the jumping from the cliff using ""the power"" won't kill them) and second time at the end when he and the blondy lost the girl... the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice... Anyways, my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this film. Guys - do not go to see it. There is very little action, no suspense, no hot girls. Girls - a least the actors are good looking... What I would advise you people is to get a soundtreck of this movie - that's the only thing I liked about it.",The Covenant
265,newyorkguy1,A film for guy crazy teen girls and man hungry gay guys,5,26 September 2006,"Where can I start on this one? The Covenant had some negatives and positives. The negatives were that the movie wasn't at all what I expected from the advertisements. I thought it was going to be at least a little scary and it turned out to be ""Just another teen movie"". Actually, with a name like ""The Covenant"", I thought it was going to be about Vampires. Guessed wrong. No blood was involved and it had mild violence that could have been compared to watching a fight between Ken and Ryu in Street Fighter with a lot of ""Haduken balls"" being thrown around. That was kind of cheesy. The positives were that it did have some originality. Kind of tired of seeing sequel after sequel and this movie gave audiences a break from that. The other positive was that it definitely was a movie for guy craving connoisseurs. This director took every opportunity to showcase the hot bodies of these young hot guys and it certainly had a tint of homoerotica. Kind of like soft porn for the gay guys. The best moments of the movie were the locker room scene showing like 20 bare naked male asses, the swim meets with barely-there speedos that if cut just one centimeter below would probably show some penis, and the guy-on-guy (not so erotic) kiss between Caleb and Chase with Chase lying on top of Caleb at one point of the movie.

I think you always need a good witch story every once and awhile and it was nice to see one with guy rather then girls in short skirts and low top wearing all black although I sure that would have gotten better reviews. I was surprise in the quality considering the fact that other then in movie preview I never saw any publicity on the film. Steven Strait did a great job in the movie and I think we might be seeing a lot more of him after this.

However, if your going out with a group of friends just to go somewhere, then it's a good pick, especially if most of your friends are girls. EXTREMELY hot guys, and guys, don't be deterred that there's a male locker room scene, there's also a little bathroom scene with Sarah.

If you aren't, well I think that it's a rather good movie none the less.For me, if you don't want to wrack your brain and just have some fun visuals then you might just enjoy yourself.

His daughter was behind almost every accusation, if that's true than how was John Putnam a witch? And in the movie they also make specific references to the Putnam barn, Chase says ""The Putnam barn."" What does that mean? Is that maybe where the first witch was accused, or does it mean that's where the pact was made to protect the covenant? What's the deal? Was he really a witch?",The Covenant

The music in the movie went perfectly with it, however. Some of the lines were kinda funny. If u are a girl, who thinks the guys are hot, and aren't really concerned with a great story, go see this movie. If u are a guy... u probably wouldn't want to waste your money on it. Btw, the quotes on the page from the movie, most are wrong. I sent in an update about a month ago, but no one changed a thing. Don't go saying the ""wee yotch"" line. its wrong! Chase said, ""And how bout I make you my Wiatch?!"" that is the right line, and correct spelling. i should know.

There was some cheesy lines but that is just part of the fun, I enjoy that type of movie and I am sure that there is a lot of others out there that would agree. It was different from most of the gory nasty ones we have been seeing lately, this was suspenseful without being gross which is just the way I like it.

My friend and I where both bored to tears with it. the (and I emphasize the quotes) ""horror"" elements where not even close to scary, and I jump easily. it used standard ""building up music"" and then cut it off, just in time for the ""scary part"" yeah no-good there. they story-line itself, well lets just say that a five year old could be at least a little more interesting. The special effects; they look like they might have been done on an Apple II, OK, that was exaggeration, but really, they needed a little more wok, perhaps a little crisper, and life like.basically this movie is for whiny little boys with no self-esteem, who hold a secret hate towards others, don't see it please i beg of you.",The Covenant

Magical ablities don't get gained from many ways.. there's not much room there..Second.. the effects weren't that bad.. It was believable enough..Somethings that could've been better.. : The relationship between Caleb and Sarah.. .. in that at the end.. Caleb was supposedly 'fighting for her' when the relationship was too short lived to have that much emphasis put on Sarahs capture..Also...at the scene of their kiss before the dance.. the music was very poorly chosen as well as the kiss shot because it came out too cheesy and over-dramatic...especially since the relationship between the two characters didn't seem that 'big of a deal' until the end.And the last thing.. the shot of the school repeated WAY too much times.. i think at the end of every couple of scenes. It was a poor way to connect shots..But in the end.. I still had a good time watching it. The characters were awesome. A lot of the parts were perfect..some needed to be better..The actors played suited their roles..I enjoyed it.. I HOWEVER.. didn't like the ending. I don't know.. the movie was like a good story-telling. Its not concrete..you know it.. but you don't care.,The Covenant
275,nrn,"Good ideal, bad execution.. wow.",4,8 September 2006,"So after being with a girl addicted to Underworld for 2 years, I decided to give ""The Covenant"" a try. I mean it has a good premise and all, 5 people bound together with supernatural powers. Too bad thats about where the good ends.To start off with, the give us a GREAT back story about the foundation of the covenant, then lead off with The Teens going to a party and showing just how awesome the power can be.After that the movie pretty much turns into a bore fest, relating the ""power"" to heroin or crack. The ""power"" is so addictive that You can steal other people's powers by having them tell you ""I will you my power!1!"".Enter crack fiend number 5, that. unlike the others grew up knowing nothing of his powers and what they do (make people age fast... YIKES), who is hell bent on stalking A SINGLE OTHER GUY for his powers.That is it. That is where the Covenant ends, and what it boils down to. Two people fighting over a fix of some crack. They introduce story lines and leave them just like that. They leave off characters, and have the 3 other covenant members as background walk-ons.Then to top this all off. You would think that two people who could will whatever they want would have a pretty spectacular battle. Instead they jump around (which you would think they could possibly be flying in the air, two huge powerhouses with the ability to do anything, battling throwing buildings etc at each other), and shoot dragon-ball z type ""energy balls"".Thats the big climax. Two people that can do anything jumping around.Don't see this in the theater. Heck, only watch it on TV if you are really bored.4/10",The Covenant

It is not a good movie. watchable, not good. The script is so bad, it shouldn't been made in the first place. The budget is not bad looking for the scenery and the effects and actors and environment, but it just flops with the script. There could of been a good, even great movie if the script would of been interesting; couple of more parties, a real evil on the board and the power thing not so much about the age issue, and a lot of more gore and surprising elements.

I think its brilliant, its teens with powers acting normally in normal situations, not perfect people.

279,Moebius-19,"Starts of strong, falls apart after the twist.",5,14 December 2006,"This film started off so strong with an intriguing story and gripping Gothic atmosphere. The look and feel of the characters and environment was exactly what I was hoping for and it pulled me in immediately.The four main characters were nothing new, but were performed well and believably through out the first half of the film. Each actor setting up a more engrossing film, with well structured script and appropriate special effects, especially considering the budget that was used.But I feel that all the character building they did at the start was practically thrown out of the window when the 'not so surprising revelation' as to who the 'Bad Guy' was revealed. It seemed that the movie changed direction and was only geared to prepare for the final fight scene which, considering all the creative and varied spells we had scene from the start of the film, was a huge let down.I hoped, as the final fight scene developed, that I would be surprised and it would change pace or at least try something new. Instead it fell into this all most pointless repetition, going backward and forward like a 'Rocky' boxing match. And considering that this is staged in a world of magic and not a boxing ring, you would of thought that it would have been easy to create some variety in the scene. My only criticism of the start is the scene with the jeep and the cliff edge, the scene should have ended with the jeep brake lights disappearing and the cops assuming they had gone into the sea and died, considering it was supposed to be a secret they where pretty blatant when they used their powers to do the clearly impossible right in front of the small towns police force.Unfortunately any excitement and interest that had been stoked up at the start was quickly bled out of it shortly after the 'Twist' of what the 'Bad Guy' actually wanted. I wouldn't say this film is bad but my opinion is that it didn't tie its shoe laces before it started to run and as soon as it began to peak it fell on its bum A crying shame as I really was enjoying it.",The Covenant

284,Lisatheuklover,I loved this movie!,10,28 March 2007,"The Covenant took an alternative twist on the supernatural world by choosing to use four young men as their main characters instead of the stereotypical female ""witch"" characters. I found this movie to be decent because it stepped out of the realm of conventional supernatural movies and used its own imaginative ideas to make it convincing. The fact that the four men in the movie had these ""powers"" and were descendent's of families who were involved in the Salem Witch Trials, made it out of the ordinary, but also I liked the fact that you had to think and use your intelligence to figure out what their powers entailed and how they worked. The twists in the movie made the movie more fascinating, and one of the biggest twists was how every time each one uses their powers they get older. Also when they ascend on their 18th birthday it makes their powers stronger, which is something that has never been used before in supernatural movie. I thought it was interesting how the writer chose to use this as the consequence for using their powers too much, rather than the age old ""personal gain"" twist that many movies use.The special effects pretty much made the movie. The plot could have been better and the acting really was not that great. The director went with a lot of up and coming actors which was a bold move for a director to do on such a risky film, but overall the actors were acceptable. I really liked this movie, but I can understand how many people would not just due to the fact that you have to enjoy supernatural movies in order to appreciate it.

Nearly from the beginning I was able to guess the plot.The movie just lacked substance as a whole.

Sebastian like I said ~ very good acting especially coming down to the Barn Kiss! Let us not forget Toby who has also a great look and also good performance throughout. As far as the ""Who Goes Looking Around a Creepy Bathroom For The Broken Light"" it did not happen that way the actor left the shower out of being startled from what appeared to her a crashing noise and on her way out noticed what it was she herd laying on the floor and while picking it up in astonishment she was touched by the warlock .. thats what makes a good movie people see and hear only what they want and come to their own conclusions no matter what!",The Covenant

The special effects are very good. When i watched the bonus features on the DVD, and found out how much of the movie was actually CG, i was shocked. In some parts of the movie, it is obvious that the scene is CG, but in others, i couldn't tell at all. I would agree that the basic idea of good versus evil is a common theme, but when watching this movie, there is so much more to focus on that just that.

This movie was not a high budget film and the actors aren't that huge in the movie industry, but this movie did serve its purpose.What makes this movie interesting are the good looking cast and the story line of the Salem witch trials and it's descendants of the sons of Ipswich. Their struggle to protect their secret, lustful temptations and vengeful prerogative makes the story worth watching anytime.The acting was decent, the effects were OK and the plot presentation was horrible. I think they could of done a better job on the script, plot and character development. It seems that the movie revolve around just one character (though there are four other main characters). I would of liked to see the other characters more involve in the whole plot thing and not to mention the movie had a lot of unexplained events. Good movie but not fantastic and definitely not bad.This movie was not one bit scary (unless you have phobia of spiders), and it was more action than anything.This is a great movie if you want to escape to a different world like no other. Perfect for fantasy and sci-fi fans.It looks like the movie was set for a sequel since there were many questions unanswered in the end.

What I will give this movie is that there sure was a lot of wet, sweaty, naked & half naked boys everywhere.

(and of course hot). i thought it was so good that when i rented it, i watched it twice in 2 days then went out and bought it. if you love movies that have special effects, action, hot guys and supernatural stuff, you will like this movie. so i say give it a go, what have you got to lose. it is not like other movies that are out. most people think it will be like underworld or those styles of movies but it wasn't. yes it is a supernatural action thriller but there is more behind it. there is background and it tackles other things. even though it has the supernatural elements, it also has the realness to it. it shows teenager having powers instead of the power being more important. also it tackles what it is like to be a teenager and go through life events. quite a coming of age movie with added zing. you will be hooked and the music if amazing. even if you don't like the movie, you should watch it to listen to the soundtrack.",The Covenant

Opening scene pretty crazy stunt. As said before full of eye candy, pretty good plot, and fun to watch. I think a second one needs to be made. The effects of the powers are something not seen a lot. If had more money for budget the movie could of been a top hit, with more money equals more time to develop a stronger plot.Not one of my top 10 favourites but still worth watching and getting into. I'm sure many people into these kind of movies will like it. Sebastian stan actually ends up playing a great villain.

However I would not say that this a movie for everyone. Being a teenager I felt like it was a cute thing for our genre compared to some of the other things that are in the media today. There were some things that were completely far off and I didn't really like but by the end of the movie I did feel that I enjoyed myself.

The Covenant-as the title shows is far different than other movies.There are many movies with magic,but none of them has so much action scenes.On my opinion, the writer J.S. Cardone and the director Renny Harlin did an excellent job. Artist that have been chosen are also great. What people have to know about this movie is that it's a great teen movie. We all know something of the Salem Witches,of course,here we got a pretty good explanation about the five families,whom poses powers.Every teen girl will like it because like everywhere,here we have a man that does incredible stuff for his girl.Love!And a man that wants all the power for himself despite the consequences.

But it made for a fun Saturday night, and I didn't leave the theater feeling like I wasted 9 bucks. That may have more to do with the fact that Steven Strait was running around naked, but hey to each their own. The characters are flimsy, I so don't believe they're in high school, the plot is kind of underdeveloped, it kind of hard to figure out. I might've written better dialoge. And since I'm an avid magic/witches/vampire freak, the magic bits were so-so. The four gorgeous boys have magical powers, and the power makes them do whatever the hell they want, descendants of the survivors of the Salem Witch Trails in some god forsaken town in M.A. Some parts can freak you out a bit, but its not scary. The action is cool most of the time and thats basically all there is to it. Pretty good, but it can wait for the DVD.",The Covenant

The plot was very predictable, the dialog was far from outstanding. If they had at least tried to find some decent actors (based on acting skills, not the steaminess of their body) they might have been able to get pull it off, but no. I couldn't bring myself to give this movie more than 4 stars (and I honestly don't understand how more than 15% of the voters think this movie is a 10) - it's not a complicated movie and you'll be able to understand what happens even if you don't pay attention all the time, but ... it's just not that great.",The Covenant
311,evan_sharp9,Great idea but bad production,5,15 March 2010,"The covenant has a lot of great scenes that actually look pretty cool. But the acting was one of the many flaws of this film. The idea had so much potential to be a great film but unfortunately didn't respond well with the audience. I recently discussed this film with some of my friends that actually know a little something about films and we all agreed that this movie was a different and maybe better version (in certain ways) of the craft. But if one was to put certain fighting scenes and soundtrack from the covenant into a movie like the craft then that would be one great film in my opinion.As i stated earlier in this review, the covenant has many flaws other than acting, but one of the great things about this film is the lighting and sound. The dim lighting or the contrast is perhaps the one technique (along with its awesome soundtrack) which make the covenant actually watchable for audiences. So if your board one day and want to watch something supernatural that has an ending that will leave you curious and wondering if they will ever make another with te same title than the covenant is one to watch (but only once). In my personal opinion this movie needs a better actor to play the bad guy (not that Sebaston Stan was bad, because he wasn't) like Cam Gigandet, an actor that has saved more movies than one in his young film career. (again Sebaston Stan actually plays a good bad guy, but personally i would like to see Cam Gigandet as yet again another bad character",The Covenant

But this movie was boring and it didn't have to be. It just wouldn't speed up and the audience in my very large theater started to act up. I thought with characters with supernatural powers the showdown would be awesome. Special effects everywhere. Shapeshifting, invisibility everything a writer with an imagination should have thought of but alas none of that. So much promise charming and hot leads but just boring.Scene spoiler below++++++++ But one thing I have to ask horror directors to consider in the future. The audience thought the girl in the shower was a stupid scene. Why would a terrified girl look for an assailant? The audience was rooting for her to get killed. It was stupid not scary.",The Covenant
313,kandi4525,review on the covenant,8,10 September 2006,In my opinion this was definitely a movie worth watching. Steven Strait and the rest of the sons of Ipswich were bonus eye candy who just happen to be able to act really well. Steven Strait was a great choice to lead the pack and this movie will hopefully get him the recognition that him and the rest of his gang of gifted friends deserve. The special effects were great and some of the scenes really had you jump back. I loved how the story line included history of the area and tied back to the story line in the covenant. The only criticism that I could have for this movie is that I would have liked to see a little more background on the four boys. If there had been more background on their lives when they were younger I think it could have made the movie even better than it already was. All I can say is there better be a sequel to this because I would love to see more.,The Covenant

When you have no confidence in the story or the actors, edit the film at such a frenetic and hysterical pace that neither the human eye nor the human brain can rest on anything long enough to register anything other than delighted stupefaction. This nonsense is predicated on accepting that there really were witches in Salem in the 17th Century. In other words, the religious fanatics who burned women at the stake had it right. For those truly interested in the actual story of what happened in Ipswich, Salem and other New England towns, the film Salem Witch Trials, directed with skill and understanding by Joseph Sargent, is highly recommended.

I don't care much for Gothic-style movies, but I figured, what the hell. I thought it could turn out to be a decent flick, Underworld wasn't too bad, but I was wrong. It sucked...hard. The movie had cheesy dialogue, bad acting, Salem Witch references (witches being executed by bigots is stupid enough, leave it alone), and the movie just, well, ended. Yep, the story jumped around from scene to scene like a jack russell terrier for an hour and a half, most with no connection whatsoever, then there was a battle scene that reminded me of the old Street Fighter games, then it just ended.Still want to see the movie? Don't waste your money. Here, I'll sum it up for you in five lines: Battle using explosive air as a weapon. Bad guy disappears. Girl: ""So, what happened to (whoever)?"" Guy: ""I don't know.""

316,adylaid,I don't understand...,10,22 January 2012,"I don't understand at all why people seem to have this movie so much! I am by all accounts a fairly intelligent person, and I have had an interest in magic and witchcraft for as long as I can remember (one of my earliest memories is of being obsessed with the movie Matilda.) I'm a writer and a psychology student, and I adore history. From the reviews that I (painfully) endured reading, people's main complaints seem to be poor acting and a lack of real plot, which I completely disagree with. While there are parts of the movie with lack-luster acting, I wouldn't consider it to be anywhere near half of the movie and beg you to remember that this was near the beginning of many of the actors' careers, as well as that quite a few of the actors have gone on to star in many more movies and be fairly well respected in their genres. Yes, this is geared towards teenagers and contains quite a bit of 'fanservice', but lets be honest with ourselves: most witchcraft/magic-based movies are aimed at teenagers. As for the lack of plot...I don't find this to have any merit. I found the plot to be very intriguing - the first time I watched it, I was left guessing until that faithful moment in the pool, and my roommates (who I just convinced to watch it with me night before last) were as well, even with the hints that I was unable to resist dropping. One reviewer claimed that the father was only included as a way for the hero to win out over the villain, but the father actually played a much larger role - he was included as an example of the addictiveness of the Power and the consequences of its overuse. As for the accusations that it is a male version of the craft...grow up. Just because two magic themed movies have the same BASIC plot (and I mean extremely basic) of good vs. evil...doesn't mean they're the same. All movies...and books...and life...have the BASIC plot of good vs. evil in some way or another. If they have a plot at all, that is. All in all, the negative reviews that I read seemed to be argumentative and heated, and most contained little to no support for their arguments. And yet they accuse those of us who like this movie of being immature and unintelligent teeny-boppers who only like it because of the sweaty, attractive guys? I'm insulted. I'm sure you're all of at least adequate intelligence, perhaps your reviews were just a lapse in said intelligence or too emotional. I'd appreciate it, however, if you refrained from grouping the rest of us into people who ""likes The Pussycat Dolls, thinks Paris Hilton is ""hot"" and watches MTV it's like some sort of wasteland"" and ""find would be boy band members ""totally HAWT LOL!!!111!!""""

317,RL0919,Like a TV Pilot,6,8 September 2006,"I went to see this mainly for the eye candy, and I wasn't disappointed on that score. But the whole thing played like a pilot for a TV show, from the opening credits all the way to the ending:* The opening credits were montage of ""relevant"" images played over a rehashed rock song, typical of TV shows (consider Charmed, for example). I literally thought of the TV pilot comparison during the opening credits. After the movie was over, my husband said that he thought the same thing at the same time.* Characters were introduced that were unnecessary for the movie, but who could be brought into future series episodes. For example, the scenes with the school provost were irrelevant to the plot. * The special effects were mostly TV-movie grade. There were one or two exceptions, which were probably required to justify a theatrical release, but mostly it was just stuff like objects levitating and people's eyes going black.* The obvious drug-addiction metaphor could have been pulled from an after-school special. * None of the major characters dies and a typical ""open-ended"" ending is provided, so the story could continue immediately from where it leaves off.Overall, the movie was competent and didn't drag or outrage, but the Sci-fi Channel puts out stuff just as good every month, and there's no admission fee.",The Covenant

Also, the mostly-unknown cast did a really good job at capturing the feeling of the movie. I did jump at a few parts, but it was more of a thriller type of movie. The best line in the whole movie is Reed's: ""Harry Potter can kiss my a*s!"", it was great. There will most likely be a sequeal, as the audience is left on a cliffhanger of some sort. I also really enjoyed the romance between Caleb and Sarah--it was sweet, not the ""let's-jump-into-bed"" kind that too many movies have today.I'm not one for horror movies, but I'll def. be buying this when it comes out on DVDPlus the boys were hott",The Covenant

I vaguely remember the previews for this movie, and with the new hype of 'Gossip Girl', I decided to sit through this movie because of the pure satisfaction that Chase Crawford is in it.My mistake. This movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but I expected better. It was definitely your typical teenage thriller, but because I am in my late teens I failed to find the fright. The acting was alright, the dubs were a little annoying, especially during the long fight scene in the end between Caleb and Chase. The effects weren't all that bad either. The entire cast is gorgeous - the one thing I wouldn't change about the movie, which was probably way it attracted so many viewers.

Seeing as how I hadn't heard of the movie before, I was going to watch it with a completely open mind. However . . . the acting could have been better, although the story line was one dimensional, so the actors didn't have much to go on. It was your standard teen Gothic thriller . . . but worse. There were a couple of good chuckles, but they came at times where I wasn't sure if they were trying to be funny. Maybe I'm being too harsh? I'm not sure, however, I can see this movie being good for the younger set, 12 - 17 (I'm 25). The guys are cute, the girls are pretty, but that's not enough to make it a good movie.",The Covenant

Also, I really did enjoy watching some of Harlin's camera shots and action sequences; the fights with the magikal black eyes was quite alluring. One scene imparticular that I thought to be very well created was the spider sequence...I found it truly frightening and the CG effects seemed very realistic. The effects during most of the action scenes were also very well created, but I did think the dialouge coming from character Chase was extremely cliché and too much like a hokey comic book.

323,eighthsamurai,"In the words of 80's cops - ""I'm getting too old for this s**t!""",2,6 May 2007,"Maybe I didn't get this because I am getting too old. When I was a kid, I think the film that might most closely match this is ""The Lost Boys"". Now that was an amazing movie. The acting was great, there was some great humour and for a kid, it was pretty frightening. It was action-packed, had a great soundtrack, it had everything. Even though it was intended for a younger audience, it wasn't patronising and cheap. To this day, it is still one of my favourite movies.1996, I am a teenager. ""The Craft"" comes out. Similar to ""The Covenant"" in many ways. I enjoy it less but it still has all the basic elements of a good movie, and it's fun to watch. But I didn't think it was as cool as The Lost Boys.Today, I watched the Covenant. I was very confused as to whether this was just a bad movie, or whether I just didn't get it anymore. See, in ""The Lost Boys"" you didn't need an inconsistent and badly integrated metal soundtrack to create excitement. You didn't need cheap shots of hot girls in underwear, hanging out in a school where everyone is amazingly handsome and ""cool"" (i'll come back to this). You didn't have terrible actors, stroking their face every time they wanted to convey a negative emotion (check out Caleb).There are a lot of people saying this movie was ultra-cool. Now, this is where I start to not get it. Putting the dialogue and story aside for a second (because that's not why you'd watch a movie like this) and just looking at the characters, what was so cool about them? The vampires in ""The Lost Boys"" were cool. Every scene with them made you want to be a vampire. They oozed counter-culture and teenage rebellion. And they didn't need pretty-boy baby-faces, unrealistically buff bodies, Abercombie & Fitch dress senses, tons of metro-sexuality, and above-all, below average IQ's - all the traits that the characters in this film had. Is this what ""cool"" is these days? I would hate to think so, because that would make me despair for the future. This film was so dumbed down that it was ridiculous - and it seemed to promote what appears to me to be the prevalent ideas of ""cool"" in today's society - conformity and superficiality. Get big muscles because everyone else has them and girls won't like you if you don't. Also, remember to always be clean-shaven, wax your finely-coiffured hair and shop at the Gap.Obviously, this is a male perspective. Girls will and should love this because they get to see ""hot"" guys in all their cloned glory. But for guys who watch this and think it's cool - the world has gone strange on me and has passed me by, leaving me little understanding of what youth value these days.",The Covenant
324,SpydaManny,popcorn movie?,2,18 January 2007,"I feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10. Okay, noted that the special effects are, 'okay' and Renny Harlin did make one my favorite genetically-altered-sharks-attack-a-research-station movie, that of which you may know as Deep Blue Sea. Also, the opening credits are done fairly well with a remix of WhiteZombie's ""more human then human' and it does go fairly well with what is in the context of this 'movie'. But enough praise, lets get to the reason why this movie sucks so much.Not since Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted. Okay, our story starts with four guys who are descendants of four different families, each of which possess a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that did a never fully explained art of witch craft. Oh and for some reason, these descendants are all 17, all go to the same school, are all on the swim team and all, for some reason or another, sit in bed with their shirts off, sweating and talking to each other on the phone. I have nothing against gays, Gothic or thirteen year old's, but that is what this movie is aimed at...13 year old goth who question their sexuality. Yeah there's girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or whatever, but how come they don't take their shirts off? hey its only fair.Anyways, the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18, they will ascend and be granted new profound, almost god-like powers. But before i go any further, i forgot to mention that when they use their powers, they age slowly and they grow more addicted to it. That explains why they got people in their late 20's to play 17 year old's. Oh and if something needs explaining, don't worry, someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog. God this movie sucks...where was I? oh yeah, the ascension part.Okay, apparently there was a super-secret-alpha-one family that the others forgot about or some s#*t like that, i don't know, i was dozing off at this point. But they were written out some how and the new kid at school who is befriending the group is 'secretly' one of these descendants from the fifth family. And I say 'secretly' because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. He has greater power then the others because he's older i think. Anyways, Bob Loblaw (say it out loud) things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie.To be honest, I was all game for a witch battle. You know like Saurmon vs. Gandalf or anything along the lines with magic battle, because you know, this is about witches and stuff. Now, when these two witches throw down, its more of like...how can i put it...a very, very crappy version of a Dragonball Z type battle. They throw stuff at each other, talk, throw stuff, talk, throw stuff, talk etc. When i say 'throw stuff' i only say that because i have no clue what the F#%k their throwing at each other. It looks like big gobs of slimy water. God this movie sucks, anyways, when our main witch 'ascends' he doesn't get very powerful at all. He just throws bigger gobs of slimy water. Things happen and it ends in a way that you as the viewer know its gonna end. The good witch wins bad witch loses.You know how shitty a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as, 'I'm gonna make you my Wiotch' Thats where i wanted to punch myself in the face for sitting through this whole...thing.Yes, i admit, the thought of witches doing battle, using powers in the modern day does sound kinda cool, but when the execution is this bad, i really wished they didn't make THIS movie. Maybe if it was R-rated, had tit's and threw in more deaths with a dash of gore, it might have worked...might have worked.If your interested in watching this, don't buy it or even rent it. Wait for it to come on TV or borrow it from your sucker of a friend who bought it. Just don't waste your time with this hack of a movie. If you spend any money on it, there's a good chance your putting an effort towards a sequel to be made by Uwe Boll called, The Covenant 2: Alone in the dark with the house of the dead.",The Covenant

327,Skbr71,A Theatre Major's Opinion. . .IT ROCKED!!!!!,8,15 September 2006,"I saw ""The Covenant"" the day after it came out. My neighbor and i were looking for a movie and i knew i wanted to see it since Steven Strait was in ""Sky High"" (which by the way is amazing) and Laura Ramsey was in ""She's the man"" (again amazing) and they acting looked promising. I confess that i had reservations. I don't like a lot of sex/nudity in movies and i was worried this would be filled with it. The two shower scenes were quite tame in my opinion which made the movie more tolerable. Also since the film was male dominated i worried about a lot of guys walking around without shirts. Again ""The Covenant"" proved me wrong with only three or four scenes containing half clothed boys. As i sat through the first half i was in a fidget thinking that this movie would suck major big-time, then i saw the first killing and the way all the characters interacted and related to each other, i was like ""okay i like this."" I am twenty years young and was a theater major for about a year so i view movies very critically. Also i have written a few plays and know how duologue and script must be written to be well received, performed, and understood by an audience. The duologue was good. It was solid and for those who say ""wah wah wah the duologue sucked"" try writing a script and see if yours doesn't suck jerk. It is not a perfect movie (nothing this side of Heaven is), but it is a well done movie with a decent script that is not hard to follow and leaves you with complications in the story.The acting, as i said earlier, was good. Body language was good and duologue was not forced or monotone. It flowed easily like this could have been any prep school in New England. Especially the scene at the drug store. I work at a camp over the summer and i go into town to get stuff we forgot and random people just come along. The way Chase resented the bond that was between Pogue Tyler Reid and Caleb could be picked up in subtle ways even before he attacked Kate with the spiders.For those who didn't like the movie and ""knew"" it would be bad in their opinion, WHY THE FRIGG DID YOU GO SEE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? this movie isn't supposed to change the world or win an Oscar, it is to entertain and it did just that. A lot of well placed little things made it shine in my opinion. The kiss was so weird, awkward and random that it was perfect. Never knowing if it was Reid or Chase harassing Laura in the shower is an amazing insight into what happens when you ""use"" too much and think you can do anything. I wont say anything about the ending other than i thought it was classic and not having complete closure to what the boys (Caleb, Pogue, Reid, Tyler) and girls (Kate, Laura) just went through is a little opening to say ""perhaps a sequel?"" For those who read this, i recommend seeing ""The Covenant"" in the cinema while its there. Go in with on expectations and throw away your stereotypes of movies. This was a good movie with good acting, script and directing. i hope you enjoy it as much as i did",The Covenant

The magic they use is believable, nothing that looks fake or goofy at all. You'll actually really get into this movie like they can hear you ha-ha. I do plan on buying this. Something good to watch any time of the year for a date or sleepover, it'll be great around Halloween time too because of the eeriness they put into the movie. I liked it so much I even showed my sister, who also ended up loving it as well as my dad. Plenty of good action scenes and romance as well.",The Covenant
330,tigerclaws29,It seems like a great book that made a better than okay movie. But I liked it!,8,9 September 2006,"The Lost Boys meets The Craft. If you liked both those movies then this is one for you to watch. The premise behind the movie is not good verses evil, but how power can be seductive, and how there are those who can resist and control it, and then there are those who can't. The movie is geared towards the teenage genre, but if you can overlook that, it can be pretty entertaining. Four male witches born of a secret covenant, and their struggle to keep their powers under control. I personally loved the special effects, and even though there seemed to be quite a few holes in the plot, I still enjoyed the movie. For those of you who like to look upon beautiful things, there is definitely plenty of that in the form of the lead actors, and actresses. In conclusion, the plot is kind of flimsy, but still entertaining, and there is enough eye candy for the girls, and great special effects for the guys. It seems like a great book that made a better than okay movie. But I liked it!",The Covenant

I recommend everyone to go see this movie. Because its scary and funny too. ALl of the actors are very talented and very smart. I like the whole beef between the good guy and the bad guy. And i like it a lot! It kind of reminds me of Black Circle Boys and The Craft. But its an OK movie thought. Its very good and i enjoy watching and eating popcorn and candy at the same time.

332,KristinaR,Had potential,8,5 February 2008,"I really enjoyed this movie - love the actors and director, but it fell short of my expectations. It had so much more potential to be an outstanding movie. I would have liked to see the characters developed a little more. Maybe even some flashbacks to their first experiences with their power. The interaction with ""The Sons of Ipswitch"" could have been expanded. We saw Caleb's parents, but what about showing the others and how they have dealt after ascending. I know that the focus was supposed to be on Caleb, but the other families were important to show the choices and interactions. Loved the rain and the final fight scene, but there were so many possibilities of expanding the special effects. The intro was amazing - showing some of those photos during different portions of the movie would have been great - like when they realized the fifth line had not died out. I wish that they would do a Covenant 2, with the same cast - but expand on the story, characters and special effects.",The Covenant
333,Deezee1029,"Meanwhile, back at the Ipswitch Barn...",10,9 September 2006,"I have to say that the trailer for this movie hooked me right away, and it only helped fuel my interest that it was from some of the ""minds"" who put together Underworld. I wouldn't call myself an action movie fan, that is to say I never go to a movie for the fight scenes alone, but I have to say that those scenes were great as well.True, the movie is no masterpiece, but it's very entertaining: hot guys, witches, Catholic-esquire type boarding school with mysterious gusts of thick fog, and an added dose of history for the kiddies. The movie has a style all it's own (much like Underworld in that sense)and a high powered soundtrack that does the brooding stares and levitation justice. The movie did have flaws though: a dead boy who shows himself to the members of the Covenant in the form of a ""darkling"" it's revealed who is behind the appearances but not why, or where they've come into contact with other ""darklings"" since they seem to know what they are. I also thought that Sara's character was never developed fully, like why does she have a huge crucifix tattooed on her back (symbolism? or Art Directors having nothing else to do that day?) Another untapped storyline was that of Reid and Tyler, the back-up Covenant members who just stand there and play stereotypes. I also thought that the end was a little dull, but as another reviewer pointed out it sets it up for a sequel, which at this point I wouldn't mind seeing.",The Covenant
334,moonymuch,Gorgeous guys and not much else,4,16 September 2006,"What disappointed me about this film was that it had the potential to be much, much better than it actually was. The storyline was promising: four families of immense power dating back to the Salem Witch trials, and a fifth family that disappeared when it wanted more power. That was what propelled me to the movie theater in the first place (and the appearance of those five lovely boys helped as well).However, I was quickly disappointed as the movie began. There was almost no story and certainly no explanations. Like, for example, precisely why the fifth family disappeared. All we get are ominous mumblings of ""the fifth"" and references to the Putnams and Popes of Salem Witch Trial fame. Other things are not fully explained, either, concerning the power the four hold. Only as the movie progresses do you get a sense of what the power does, which makes for a lot of confusion throughout the whole movie.Another thing that really irritated me was the lack of character development. All you got, really, can be summed up here: Caleb, Pogue, Reid, and Tyler: good. Chase: bad. Sarah and Kate: damsels in distress. I think they could have delved more into the relationship between the four boys especially - they had a dynamic that I liked a lot. All in all, the characters were all very one-dimensional, which was disappointing because there could have been so much more said about them. The thing that got me the most, though, was the typical Hollywood portrayal of teenagers as sexual beings and not much else. Why can't Hollywood ever really portray teenagers beyond that? All in all, it was an all right movie that could have been much better. Fight scenes are pretty good, though.",The Covenant
335,criticluvr42,Not too bad...More of an Action Chick Flick,7,7 September 2006,"So, from the trailer you can tell the main plot--A long time ago  like, back in the 1600s with the Putnams and whatnot  five magical families settled and formed the Ipswich Colony in Massachusetts. Four families continued their bloodline hiding their powers, but one family mysteriously disappeared. Anyways, in the present day, the four modern descendants (Hotties, f.y.i.) unravel a disturbing plot for the ringleader's power when the lost bloodline returns.I have to admit, I really wanted to see the movies because the guys were gorgeous, but also because it was from the producers of Underworld. That's what immediately caught my attention. Underworld had some great action sequences and I went in, expecting the same result with this movie. And I got it, and much more.The final showdown between good and evil (if you didn't see it coming, watch the trailer again), was phenomenal! The sequence you kept your heart racing as Caleb and Chase battled it out, but too bad it wasn't a four on one battle.However, the overall feeling of the movie was a bit choppy. One moment it's all tense, the next it's all happy-go-lucky. Just a lot of confusing feelings.Well, the reason I call this an Action Chick Flick, is because, like I said before the guys are gorgeous, and damn near flawless! Though the characters Caleb (Steven Strait) and Progue (Taylor Kitsch) and the mysterious new evil guy, Chase (Sebastion Stan), are the main ones to be seen, followed by Reid (Toby Hemingway), and then Tyler (Chance Crawford;which you hardly ever see), they are like 10 foot eye candies on the big screen. Ladies, you won't be disappointed.As for you boys, don't worry there's these two girls that just settle into the plot, Kate (Jessica Lucas) and Sarah (Laura Ramsey). Though you don't get to see their ""assets"" like you do with the guys, there's some PJ discussions that'll make you wish they had a pillow fight.I really enjoyed this film. I wouldn't say it's a blockbuster hit or anything, but it's more for teenagers and it has an interesting plot. The action is superb, the guys a wonderful, and it makes you want to see more (and with the ending, it appears there could be that possibility). So, keep an open mind and just enjoy it, it's just pure entertainment with a crafty magical side.",The Covenant
336,kurayami_chan,"not great, but I have seen worse...",5,9 September 2006,"After seeing the previews for this, I went in expecting to see something like a slightly cheesier version of ""The Craft,"" but with boys, and I wasn't disappointed. At the most basic level, the premise is similar: four teenagers at a private school dabbling in supernatural power/magic. However, while ""The Craft"" is by no means a brilliant film, the writing and acting are both substantially better than what's seen in ""The Covenant."" The story has a lot of potential, but it's not very well presented. There's very little explained before the last 30-45 minutes of the movie, and even then there's very little of the background explained. Combined with the poorly written script, this makes it difficult to develop and real interest in the characters. The protagonist (Caleb Danvers, played by Steven Strait) comes across as unrealistic, and the antagonist (Chase Collins, played by Sebastian Stan) as annoying at best. And Sarah (played by Laura Ramsey) is little more than a plot device.And despite claims to being a horror movie/thriller, there's really nothing scary about it- unless you've got a fear of badly written dialog and cheesy special effects.With all this in mind, it does have some redeeming qualities. There's plenty of eye-candy: all of the leads are gorgeous, and the boys spend a considerable part of the film shirtless. And there are a few moments that make for a good (if unintended) laugh. Over all, it's entertaining. Not that bad for a PG-13 movie with a target audience of young teenagers- but I'd recommend either catching a matinée or waiting for the DVD to arrive at your local Blockbuster.",The Covenant

I think it pleases more girls by the casting of young male actors. Eh-hem.. hot guys can make a movie bearable to watch but doesn't mean it's good film. It's okay to watch with your friends because the corny and lame parts can still make people laugh. I liked more the special effects but the story wasobvious because lines gave out too much information. I think this film shows that losing the sense of audience participation sucks out all the mystery and seems almost senseless to watch unless your a girl/guy who would love to watch hot men run around screen. This movie would probably please 12 to 16 year old girls and guys who like come for cgi bits in the movie.",The Covenant

It was suspenseful only when there was ""suspensful"" music.There were a lot of things I noticed in the movie that didn't fit the continuity, and made you think ""yeah, right."" Two major things that I CAN'T get over are...1. In scene where the lead ""hero"" character (see i can't even remember names) takes the ""girlfriend"" to the old colonial house in his convertible, it shows close up shots of them in the car and also far away shots of the car and scenery. My gripe is that in the far away shots it's freaking POURING RAIN, and their roof is down. And in the close ups they are untouched by rain, because magically, it isn't raining! 2. In the last final scenes the barn is burning, almost engulfed in flames and yet inside the girlfriend is still floating in a deep sleep, untouched by fire!! And if the bad guy dies, shouldn't his power die also? - Taking the spell off of the girl? At the end of the movie the guy and girl just drive away in his ""magically fixed"" convertible. Why didn't the firemen or cops question them?? They were critical witnesses associated in the fire! Okay..i'm done beating this movie with a stick.Overall I give it a 7 cuz it didn't suck as much as Poseidon.",The Covenant
340,allimba,"There's fun and action, but it's not a blockbuster hit",8,17 February 2007,"The theme and plot of the story are great. I mean that would be so cool to have magical powers and have a cool ancestry like the boys do. The guys are really hot, especially in their wife beaters and swim trunks. However the acting is pretty awful, and they all reminded me of Paul Walker, really hot, but always has the same emotion (I swear it's true, if you watch all his movies he has the same CA surfer dude). Even though the acting was pretty bad, you can still see the characterization and I really enjoyed that. In the group you have the leader, the bad-ass, the sensitive one, and the quiet guy, and I don't know I just liked that part of the movie. Also I really enjoyed the scenery, I've driven through Ipswich, and I loved seeing parts of it again. I really didn't think this movie was a horror film, and I mean I got scared in the Ring (which everyone says wasn't scary, I beg to differ). The is only 1 scary part in this movie and that has to deal with spiders, which is pretty creepy I have to say. So yea overall if you want to watch hot guys and don't care about the acting then this is a movie for you and a movie for me too.",The Covenant
341,damien_field,"Worthwhile, but don't look for too much depth...",7,9 September 2006,"Having just seen the movie for the first time today, I've got to say that it's definitely an eye-candy flick a la The Matrix at times. If you're looking for a clever plot, you can find that hidden in the background. If you're not quite that cerebral and want to just watch something ever so slightly different than the usual action movie, you can have that as well. The main area where this movie suffers is in character development. Characters remain static in their personality, and the only real advancement to be seen is in ""power levels."" Some of the characters are almost stock (Caleb as the responsible eldest, Reid as the younger rebel against authority, and Chase as the outsider looking to usurp what he never had). This can lead to some disappointment if you're expecting to see a character come to realize anything profound. It's not going to happen, unfortunately. Thrown in are several amusing lines that leave you chuckling even after the movie's over, but these occur mostly in the first half of the movie. In general the movie is entertaining, but seems not to have taken advantage of the potential of the story. All in all, worth watching but don't stress if you can't catch it in theaters. It'll definitely be eye candy on DVD before too long.",The Covenant
342,Fik_Du,It's like an upgrade Indie movie,5,9 September 2006,"I'll be honest the only reason I wanted to see the movie was because of Steven Strait. I saw him in Sky High first, although he didn't do a major role, it was still good. Undiscovered was a little more different, and easily forgettable. But this one? I mean it starts off really slow, and it doesn't pick up until the 'Near-Climax' scene. Not to mention the fact that most of the stuff that you see in the trailer happen within the first twenty minutes. Which again could have been great if they had expanded on it. Instead the scene would happen, Steven would say a 'cutting' line and that was it. I personally just think that they should have gotten a stronger cast. All of them where unknown but it really was like watching Models act. -five lines and a swipe to the camera.But yeah, the plot was great, and if this is anything like Underworld, there's going to be another movie and it will most likely be better.",The Covenant

Unfortunately, this film attracts hordes of teens and pre-teens who squeal every time a guy shows his abs or a girl flashes a little cleavage. I walked out before the halfway point and asked for, and got, my money back. Better to wait to see it on DVD if you can't stand the lack of civility that is common among younger audiences. However, if you can handle being surrounded by teens calling out comments like, ""go for the p*ssy,"" and ""nice ass, b*tch,"" then you might notice that some of the acting by the young performers is really quite credible and the cinematography sets an adequately creepy tone.

Sure some of the movie was a little lame, but who can complain when you can see Steven Strait in a speedo.Sure this movie didn't have a deep and complex plot, but the characters were funny and true to the attitudes of a high school student.( Mostly the Reid Character) I think the movie did its job to entertain the audience and did not make the movie more complicated than it needed to be.

Her reply? ""Nothing.""All in all, this movie is about as fascinating as bread, and NOT the delicious freshly-baked kind... While I'll give some kudos to the cinematography, as some scenes look quite good, the seemingly continual darkness and rain gets repetitive and boring. Many of the characters are quite good-looking, and for those I've spoken to, this was the highlight. Sad, isn't it? Mindless, meandering and mouldy are words that come to mind when pondering the plot. Ugh. Perhaps most annoying of all is the lead female role. This character is bubblegum, and stereotypically girlie-girl. The feminine, damsel-in-distress routine is frustrating - grow a brain! While appealing to some, the lack of depth and originality in this is another wearying factor. Most of all, it seemed my friend and I were constantly asking one another what was actually going on. An inconsistent plot with holes that make it very confusing to follow further reduce the overall enjoyability of this ""film"".Yes, this COULD have been a very good movie, if there existed a decent plot line, meaningful dialogue and original characters.

You need to drag yourself to the movie and decide for yourself whether you would like it or not.I, personally, loved this movie. I cannot deny that their could have been more character modification and that they needed to build up more on the storyline - but aside from those facts, the movie wasn't awful like people are making it out to be. It was very enjoyable for those of you who don't worry constantly about the little facts that don't make sense.The four families of the Covenant who survived have lived in peace thus far, carrying on their supernatural legacy from the age of 13. But when the fifth of that family returns after having not been seen for hundreds of years for the power Caleb Danvers, a fourth family of the Covenant, will receive when he ascends, the entire Covenant is threatened to be torn apart. Caleb must protect the girl he loves and the friends he loves with the only choice of giving away his powers.Once again, I will repeat: You have to have an imagination to see this movie because not all of the small questions will be answered.

Seeing a movie that is such a train wreck is highly entertaining, and I must say there is not not a thing about this movie that I did not find hilarious. I watched this with my friends, and it was tons of fun to criticize. I highly recommend everyone do this: just get a bunch of your'e friends over, make some snacks, and get ready to laughAs far as actual criticism goes, this movie fails at most aspects. The aesthetic of this movie is very dated: lots of crushed blacks and overall ugly yellow and blue saturation over most scenes, with terrible special effects. Dialogue is some of the most non intentional funny stuff. For example, I distinctly remember the lines ""Harry Potter can kiss my ass"" and ""It's like a penis, but smaller"", which were some of the most quotable among my friend group afterwards. The guys are supposed to be witches, I think, but their powers are never really explained, and every time the use their powers its just very cringe inducing and laughable. I don't think anyone in the production of this movie really knew what the plot is, so most of the time we had no idea what was going on and what characters motivations were. There is a twist I guess at the end, with one of the pretty boys turning out to be evil, and I guess it made sense,but it wasn't very good.It's very clear this movie was made for teenage girls or gay guys, because there are lots of scenes of just shirtless, sweaty guys in bed, or shirtless guys by the pool, etc. All of the main characters are very JCrew modelesc looking bad boys with very generic white boy names. There is also a romance in this, but both the leads have such one note terrible acting and bland chemistry, so it didn't really land.Overall though, this is such a quotable and stupid movie, so if your'e looking for that, you've found it.

There are several one liners throughout this entire film that give it a sense of realism and believability, and though I was sometimes gripping the hand of my boyfriend tightly due to some of the scenes, such as the spider scene, I throughly enjoyed this film.I also sat through the film, wishfully thinking how long it would take me to find the soundtrack, as the music just brought this movie even further up in my charts, as it was masterfully chosen for the horror/supernatural effects.I was amazed at the special effects in this movie, lately it seems that I have had to watch extremely believable acting and yet the special effects destroy that image, yet in this movie, I almost caught myself believing that such things were possible and that the people with the powers were just hiding in the world afraid of others.I found the love blossoming between the two characters Caleb and Sarah, sweet and completely unlike that of most films made today, it shows the innocence of the relationship, and shows that not everyone ends up sleeping with each other on the first date.Overall I would have to give this movie 10 out of 10, due to the effect of the music, special effects and the acting of the characters. Renny Harlin has done an amazing job on this movie and has brought out the best in little known actors. I recommend this movie.",The Covenant
356,mrmooman,Just another crummy American horror? film,6,30 December 2006,"I watched a lot of horror movies in the past 6 months and have come to realize that if it comes out of the USA it's more than likely gonna be crap. For example, this movie The Covenant (where were the ladies from Charmed when we need them or even Samantha from Bewitched); Abominable (and it was!); Boo (more like yawn!); Cursed (curses for watching it); San Franpsycho (I admit I could only watch 10 minutes of this epic); Pulse (or anything else that's had the Wes Craven touch); The Visitation (don't even thinks of visiting this one); The Fog (okay Canada & USA). I could go on. I think I'll stick to English films like The Descent or Dog Soldiers and/or European like Haute Tension. Sure beats the usual pretty rich boy/girl in trouble in richville USA.",The Covenant
357,anultimateparadox,Horrendous,1,9 September 2006,"I did not go into to this movie expecting it to be great; I didn't even go in expecting it to be okay. I went in expecting mediocre plot and dialogue, with the possibility of some sweet fight scenes and special effects. All I wanted was to be entertained for a few hours. The first ten minutes were good, but when the best part of the movie is the opening credits there isn't much else to say. There is one good line in the entire movie, half the plot is never explained and in the parts that are explained there is one loop-hole after the next. The dialogue was not only boring and trite, but the atrocious acting made it even worse.All in all, the movie has a great soundtrack, but it can't mask how horrible this movie gets after the first 10 minutes, it's not entertaining or even a re-hash of Underworld, it's just bad. At least I went to the matinée showing.",The Covenant
358,pompomchic,mehh.,3,3 February 2007,"wow. so, this movie was very hard to understand. the darklings made no sense to me whatsoever, and the way the scenes shift in sequence, it's practically impossible to tell what's going on. the dialog is very cheesy, and the special effects weren't that good. there doesn't seem to even be a point to the movie until about 2/3rds of the way through, and there was very poor acting. the music was decent, and the costumes of choice were okay, a lot of black. the best thing about this movie was that the four guys were hot. superficial, i know, but hey. i'm seventeen. a lot of the scenery and settings were obviously fake, and the movie made too many attempts at ""scare scenes"". not to mention the fact that it was set up for a sequel. overall- not my pick for a good movie. it was hyped up way more than i thought it was worth.",The Covenant
359,nhsmajorette4,The Covenant,3,12 September 2006,"I thought this movie was pretty good, if not lacking in some places. It's really good if you liked Underworld, all heavy metal music playing in the background during fight scenes where the guys bounce off the walls at each other. Everyone in this movie is hot, and while there is action for the guys, there is eye candy for the girls. When the four sons of Ipswitch are nearing their 18th birthday, particularly Caleb who is the oldest of the four and only days away from ascending (when they gain all of their powers), a son of the fifth family who were thought to have all died out shows up, and threatens The Covenant with the powers he has already gained.",The Covenant
360,jclh,Enjoyable,6,9 September 2006,"While the movie wasn't a spectacular work of art, it did have several great shots. The scenery was gorgeous, and the actors/actresses are all on the visually appealing side of things. The CG effects were well done, as was the makeup.I went in expecting to see a B-movie, and that's what I got. It was enjoyable in parts, though other parts had me groaning. The only thing that could have made it more ""B"" would have been a scene with scantily clad girls running from a monster/ghost/badguy.Some of the lines made me cringe (""wi-otch"" comes to mind...) while others left me smiling ( ""this is me leaving..."") and I did laugh out loud a couple of times ( ""It's like a penis... only smaller..."" ).So, it was surely not an Oscar competitor, but it was a good movie to watch, and I will be buying it on DVD when it comes out.",The Covenant
