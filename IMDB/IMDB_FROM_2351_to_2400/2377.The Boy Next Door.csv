0,bkoganbing,How can she ignore......................................,3,14 June 2015,"Playing the title role of The Boy Next Door is Ryan Guzman and he's attracted Jennifer Lopez's attention. Jen's looking for attention herself since she tossed out her cheating husband John Corbett and Guzman is quite the hunk. In a moment of weakness she gives in and when she tries to tell him it was all a mistake Guzman goes psychotic on her. He also begins moving in on her life becoming an older mentor to her son Ian Savage. He even enrolls in her high school saying he's a transfer student who missed a couple of years. All lies because Guzman is now fixated on her.Curiously enough a couple of weeks ago I saw the film The Idol which had another Jennifer named Jones in the starring role. I think those who created The Boy Next Door must have seen this film because that is also about a woman separated from her husband who gets seduced by a young man who also befriended her son. It was not one of Jennifer Jones's best films, but it's Citizen Kane next to this one.Anyway, J.Lo is hot and so is Guzman. That might be reason enough to watch The Boy Next Door. Lopez couldn't take her eyes off him.",The Boy Next Door
1,Leofwine_draca,Let down by predictability and bad acting,4,30 January 2018,"THE BOY NEXT DOOR is a very predictable example of the psycho-thriller genre with worse and more generic scripting than something like DISTURBIA. It suffers hugely from having Jennifer Lopez as the miscast lead, because she fails to invest her character with any particular personality or wit, and she's entirely unsympathetic to boot. There were only two scenes in the whole film I liked, and the blind date is one of them, but the rest is just ho-hum. As the story's antagonist, Ryan Guzman is laughably out of his depth and entirely unimposing, as well as qualifying for one of the oldest supposed teenagers I've ever seen. The story plays out slowly and predictability, nothing that hasn't been done before, and only picking up in the last ten minutes for a cliched but amusingly violent showdown.",The Boy Next Door
2,SnoopyStyle,It's so bad that it's .... really bad,2,31 October 2015,"High school teacher Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) throws her cheating husband Garrett (John Corbett) out. Their son Kevin (Ian Nelson) isn't happy. Nine months later, Claire is uncertain about a divorce and Garrett is trying to squeeze his way back into the family. Next door neighbor has his orphan nephew Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman) staying with him. Noah becomes Kevin's mentor and his only friend.Everything is wrong. It's way too overwrought and really bad movie-making. Guzman is too old to play a teenager and is too outwardly insane. He nearly kills a guy and only gets expelled. The cops are nowhere in sight. It's too much. The son is almost as badly written. His changes are way too abrupt. This is a bad exploitation movie. I actually think Jennifer Lopez is not the right actress for this role. It would be more compelling if Claire is a more plain looking woman. This movie is full of eye-rolling moments.",The Boy Next Door
3,claudio_carvalho,Unoriginal Standard Thriller,4,16 December 2016,"The classic literature teacher Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) lives alone with her teenage son Kevin (Ian Nelson) in a house in the suburb. She is separated from her husband Garrett Peterson (John Corbett) since she has found he had an affair with a coworker in Los Angeles. Garrett wants to have a fresh restart with Claire but she is reluctant and prefers to stay alone. When the handsome nephew of her next door neighbor Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman) loses his parents in a car accident, he moves to the house and befriends Claire and Kevin. Noah seems to be an adorable young man and soon there is a sexual tension between Claire and he and one rainy night they have one night stand. On the next morning, Claire regrets but Noah becomes obsessed for her and shows his real personality. ""The Boy Next Door"" is an unoriginal standard thriller with a well- known story. The viewer knows the whole predictable story from the beginning in a common screenplay that probably lays on the shelf of studios para every now and then make a movie. The attraction of ""The Boy Next Door"" is the hot Jennifer Lopez only; otherwise it would be complete garbage. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""O Garoto da Casa ao Lado"" (""The Boy in the Next Door House"")",The Boy Next Door

5,kosmasp,With neighbors like this ...,4,26 October 2015,"I know the saying is actually with friends like ... but with a movie title like this ... what did you expect this to be? Only thing that might surprise you, is the fact that they allegedly went back and shot some extra scenes to make this spicier. How was that before, if this is the spicy/""erotic"" version? Not that even further skin/encounters would have helped the movie.But it is what it is. And that's a terror thriller, with an almost decent villain. It actually doesn't start that bad to be honest. I liked the way this went at the beginning and Jennifer Lopez does a neat job of pulling that role of. But just to a certain degree - after that it's downhill from there. So yes this is a bad movie, but it has a few things that can be seen as saving graces - if you're forgiving enough. Standard at best",The Boy Next Door
6,michaelRokeefe,One lapse of good judgment.,7,31 August 2015,"A movie not as predictable as you may think. It is even better that first thought. Kind of a slow burner; but look out for the bad behavior. Claire Peterson(Jennifer Lopez)is a very attract high school teacher learning to live without her cheating husband Garrett(John Corbett). A studly young man named Noah(Ryan Guzman)temporarily moves in next door and befriends Claire's son Kevin(Ian Nelson). Mrs. Peterson attempts being cordial and offers friendship. Noah is quick to be helpful as he is charming. He doesn't read false signals from Claire; he instigates overt flirtation that the teacher finds flattering...but, whoa, it becomes obvious that Noah is a bit psycho, obsessed and can't take no for an answer. One night of temptation leads into something vicious and violent.Miss Lopez has never been shy in front of a camera(who's complaining) and there are plenty of scenes that allow her to show her assets. Along with the violence, there is some partial nudity and sexual situations. This thriller earns its R rating.Also in the cast: Kristin Chenoweth, Lexie Atkins, Hill Harper and Jack Wallace.",The Boy Next Door
7,sunwarrior13,Jennifer Lopez's Version Of Fatal Attraction,4,25 June 2015,"The Boy Next Door is an erotic thriller that stars Jennifer Lopez together with Ryan Guzman, John Corbett, Ian Nelson, and Kristin Chenoweth.It tells a story about an inter-generational adulterous affair between a High School teacher and a twenty-year old student.Claire Peterson is a High School teacher that separates from her husband after he was caught cheating.Then,she and her son Kevin,meets their next door neighbor Noah,who happens to be a handsome hunk and a High School student.Claire is secretly attracted to Noah that one night both accidentally was brought by passion and slept together.Despite what happened,Claire decides not to have enter an affair with him which leads to a numerous trouble for her and her family.This was definitely another version of Fatal Attraction.No question about it.The story has been told and as the viewer watches it,there is nothing refreshing nor surprising as the story is being told except the gender change.Also,all the elements of the said film are here present like the intense sex scene between Claire and Noah and the psychotic qualities that Noah possess to make life miserable for Claire and his family.What about the ending?Well,we get to see a violent conclusion as Claire gets to finally kill Noah in the end. The only reason of probably seeing it is the presence of Jennifer but still I would prefer her corny romantic comedies rather than her own version of Fatal Attraction.",The Boy Next Door
8,preppy-3,What can I say? Predictable but I liked it a lot.,7,30 January 2015,"High school English teacher Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) lives alone with her son Kevin (Ian Nelson). She's separated from her cheating husband Garrett (a badly aged John Corbett). The neighborer next door has his 19 year old nephew Noah (Ryan Guzman) move in. Noah bonds with Kevin and is attracted to Claire. One night, in a moment of weakness, she has sex with him. The next morning she realizes it was a mistake...but he's madly in love with her and wants her all to himself.This was a HUGE hit its opening weekend and was savaged by the critics. It's no great movie and it's utterly predictable but I liked it. I was never bored for one second and it generated some suspense. Also it holds back from graphic gore until the end. It moved quickly, had an OK script and the sex scene between Lopez and Guzman was hot without being overly explicit. The acting varies. Lopez is OK but Corbett and Kristen Cheoweth were good and Guzman was excellent. He was totally believable when he was charming or being a raging psycho. Also he's ridiculously good-looking and has a great body. As for nudity--Guzman bares his butt a few times and an unnamed female extra is nude in fleeting shots. Basically this is a well-made thriller that I enjoyed watching. I give it a 7.",The Boy Next Door
9,LeonLouisRicci,The Film Fails to Get Down and Dirty Where it Counts,5,17 July 2015,"Producer and Star of This Deriva-Trite is Jennifer Lopez and Her Restraint with the Material is the Film's Biggest Failure. Why Take On a Psycho/Sexual Thriller and Pull Back on the Psycho/Sexual Stuff.Ryan Guzman as the Psycho Cannot Convey Scary in Any Sense of the Word. He Just Seems Whiny and Spoiled. He is Obviously Here and Hired for His Cutesy Charm and Hard Body. Lopez, for Her Contribution to the ""Let's hold back for good taste"", is to Not Allow Much Skin in the Sex Scenes, and the Forbidden Fruit Stuff is Almost Standard Commercial TV Standard.The Film Never Recovers from this Misstepped Tone No Matter How Hard it Tries and that Includes the Graphically Violent Ending. The Thing is Two Decades Too Late and Until This Genre Breaks Free of Sameness it is Destined for the Bargain Bin and the Usual Mediocre Playlists on the Pay-TV Channels, After a Failed Limited Run in Theatres.The Movie is Formulaic to a Fault and is Guilty of Absolutely Nothing New for 2015.

10,utgard14,"""I love your mother's cookies.""",3,18 April 2015,"Boy was this a stinker. I mean, good for some laughs with your friends but I don't think that was the intent of the filmmakers. And I use 'filmmakers' loosely here. There's a lot to tear this apart for, and other reviewers do just that, so I'll focus on just a few things that stood out to me. First, the movie's messages are disturbing. You have this woman whose husband has cheated on her with his secretary and she's debating whether to forgive him or not. Then she has a one-night stand with the teenage hunk from next door. Here's the tip of the creepy iceberg. Their love scene starts like a rape scene, with him forcing himself on her while she says ""no don't"" before eventually giving in. No means yes if you have abs of steel? Then there's the whole disgusting double standard the movie has towards the husband's actions and the wife's. Granted the two situations aren't identical but it's hard to avoid drawing the conclusion that the man sleeps around but ""comes back home"" to his family, while the wife sleeps around and all hell breaks loose for her and everybody around her.It's a terrible movie. I'll give it a 3 solely for the unintended comedy. It's hard to completely hate anything Kristin Chenoweth is in. Although she's underused and not given much to work with, sadly. One last thing -- what's with the gory eye stuff at the end? It's like this turned into a Friday the 13th sequel in the final five minutes.",The Boy Next Door
11,zardoz-13,The Trash Next Door,1,31 January 2015,"Jennifer Lopez isn't a bad actress, but she is so miscast so miserably as a high school English teacher in ""The Boy Next Door"" that not even a seasoned Hollywood helmer like Rob Cohen can salvage this substandard stalker saga. Although he has directed hits like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""xXx"" as well as above-average epics like ""Daylight,"" ""Stealth,"" and ""Alex Cross,"" Cohen appears appallingly out of his element with this formulaic fiasco. Not only does the tawdry ""The Boy Next Door"" miscast Lopez, but also it makes Ryan Guzman, John Corbett, and Hill Harper look just as inapt. Whatever Lopez and the other twelve producers on this picture admired about rookie writer Barbara Curry's screenplay must have been either altered or didn't survive the final cut. Although she received an MFA in scriptwriting from UCLA, Curry should have kept her old day job. She spent ten years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles where she toiled in the Major Violent Crimes Unit and handled federal cases involving murder-for-hire, prison murder, racketeering, arson, kidnapping, and bank robbery. Reportedly, Curry taught criminal procedure at FBI Headquarters in Quantico, Virginia, and pushed for trial advocacy at the U.S Justice Department in Washington, D.C. In time perhaps, Curry might brush up on her storytelling skills and become a better writer. ""The Boy Next Door"" is neither suspenseful nor surprising, unless you've never seen a single stalker movie. Quite often, our sexy heroine, her oblivious colleagues, and her unsuspecting kin do some really stupid moves that make this movie appear more like a comedy than a drama. The best thing about this predictable pabulum is that it clocks in at a minimal 91 minutes. Meanwhile, ""The Boy Next Door"" has sold enough tickets to qualify as a ""hit."" Produced for a paltry $ 4 million, this mediocre crime melodrama has coined more than $20 million at the box office box, an amount sufficient to pay off its budget as well as its advertising.Lopez plays English teacher Claire Peterson who teaches classic literature, specifically ""The Odyssey"" and ""The Iliad,"" at a California state public high school. Our heroine looks far too incendiary for her own good. Mind you, I'm not saying high school English teachers cannot look stunning, but Lopez strains credibility with some of her wardrobe. As the action unfolds, Claire has separated from her philandering husband, Garrett Peterson (John Corbett of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""), who careens around in muscle cars and had an affair with his secretary. Since you never get a glimpse of the other gal, you have to wonder how she compared with Claire. Presumably, Garrett was probably taking advantage of his lowly employee because she was younger than Claire. Meantime, Claire's teenage son, Kevin (Ian Nelson of ""The Hunger Games""), suffers from asthma and allergies when bullies aren't badgering him. The senior citizen next door to Claire (Jack Wallace of ""Boogie Nights"") has just taken in his handsome, but orphaned, 19-year nephew, Noah Sandborn (an improbable 27-year old Ryan Guzman of ""Step Up Revolution""), whose own dad died in a mysterious car crash. Hint, hint! Claire encounters this charming Abercrombie & Fitch pin-up boy while she is wrestling with a cranky garage door. One weekend, while Garrett and Kevin are away on a fishing trip, Claire accompanies her best friend and colleague, High School Vice Principal Vicky Lansing (Kristin Chenoweth of ""Strange Magic""), on a blind date from Hell. The well-meaning Vicky has set Claire up with a gruff anti-intellectual guy. After she walks out on this loser, our distressed heroine finds herself face to face with charismatic Noah. During a vulnerable moment, Claire abandons her morals as easily as Noah disposes of her lingerie. Lopez displays little more than her shapely thighs while Guzman keeps her breasts discreetly covered with his groping paws. The morning after when he awakens her with orange juice and coffee, Noah cannot imagine why Claire would be racked with recriminations. Complicating matters even more, Noah is a transfer student who has enrolled in classes at the same high school where Claire teaches. Lusting after her, Noah decides to pursue Claire, but she rebuffs his advances. Eventually, Noah turns psychotic. Initially, he hacks into Claire's e-mail account and obtains permission from Principal Edward Warren (Hill Harper of CBS-TV's ""CSI: New York"") to enroll in her class with her apparent approval. Similarly, Noah befriends Kevin, teaches him how to box, and tries to turn him against Garrett who wants desperately to patch up his marriage with Claire. In a burst of rage, Noah pulverizes one of Kevin's bullies, and Vicky expels Noah. Meantime, Vicky uncovers some disturbing information about Noah, and she finds herself on the wrong end of his rage. Ultimately, Noah horrifies Claire with news that he made a video of their sex act and threatens to expose her! At this point, you're liable to laugh your head hysterically off rather than gnaw your fingernails in dread.Comparatively, ""The Boy Next Door"" reminded me of ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""Single White Female,"" ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"" ""Swimfan,"" and ""Basic Instinct."" In a ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine interview, Curry said she drew inspiration from a real-life incident involving a high school teacher who had seduced one of her underage students. Sadly, the relationship between Claire and Noah, especially their voyeur episodes, is so outrageous that you cannot take the drama seriously. Cohen claims he wanted to craft the ultimate erotic thriller along the lines of those previously mentioned movies, but he embroiders clichés. Some of the action scenes, particularly a runaway car episode, provide only a momentary relief from the Harlequin-like soap opera shenanigans. Cohen generates a modicum of suspense in the tradition of ""Rear Window"" when Claire searches Noah's man cave for the sex video. Most of the time, however, you'll felt insulted by the idiotic antics of these clueless cretins. ""The Boy Next Door"" isn't a third as exciting as last year's ""No Good Deed.""",The Boy Next Door
12,oscaralbert,Universal Studios screenwriters have never seen real books . . .,5,28 January 2015,". . . except as movie props, THE BOY NEXT DOOR illustrates. They're probably too young to have been exposed to the Captain Underpants and Wimpy Kid series as students, and now it's too late. Therefore, 14 minutes, 55 seconds into BOY, they have Jennifer Lopez's character going Ga-Ga over a Readers' Digest condensed version IN English of the 2,700-year-old oral Greek ILIAD, calling it a ""First Edition""! The rest of BOY is equally as blind to Reality as sightless Iliad author Homer so deftly painted it, substituting idiocy and stupidity for anything smacking of Real Life. J.Lo must feel that this sort of material is a perfect fit for her public image, which is why she agreed to be on the posters for this film. (You can't really say that she ""acted"" in BOY, since the illiterate ""Advanced Placement Literature"" teacher she portrays is obviously her playing herself.) In a flick like this, it is natural (if not mandatory) for viewers to hope that at least the fake people such as J.Lo's ""Claire Peterson"" and the rest of her family die the sort of slow and painful deaths that they so richly deserve. Is it too much of a spoiler to reveal that most movie-goers will be sorely disappointed in that regard?",The Boy Next Door
13,neil-476,Lurid twaddle,5,13 March 2015,"Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez), 9 months into a separation from her unfaithful husband, is pleased when Noah (Ryan Guzman), the 19-year old nephew of her cancer-stricken next door neighbour, mends her garage door, befriends her 16-year old son, and joins her school class about the classics. She is flattered when he finds her attractive and foolishly succumbs to his charms one night. But she hasn't reckoned on the lengths he will go to in order to convince her that their ""relationship"" is for the long term.This film is labelled as an erotic thriller: I would suggest that ""ridiculous lurid melodrama"" is a better label. It has one thing in its favour: Jennifer Lopez, at 45, looks sensational. From there, it's all downhill. Guzman, playing 19, looks every one of his 27 years. Lopez, who hasn't actually done anything wrong, is driven entirely by guilt and the desire to keep her indiscreet night a secret, when simply telling people (husband, school, police) the truth would solve, at a stroke, all the problems Noah causes. Plot threads are started and then never taken anywhere. And, of course, there is the usual raft of not acting like people would in real life (paramount among which is knocking him out and then not taking the gun off him – what, did you think he wouldn't regain consciousness? They always do, you know).And the much touted sex scene? Well, at least it doesn't have the fabled Hollywood S-shaped sheets, but it does have boob-covering hands. Ms Lopez is on record as saying that filming it was an uncomfortable experience – I bet it was, Guzman's hands were clamped down like a pair of limpets.This film contains absolutely nothing of interest for anyone who has ever seen a stalker movie before and isn't a fan of J-Lo.",The Boy Next Door
14,FlashCallahan,I'm having dinner!!!....,4,16 February 2015,"Neglected by her adulterous husband and left feeling particularly vulnerable as her marriage crumbles, lonely teacher Claire has an affair with a younger neighbour. But things soon turn terrifying as his fiery lust morphs into dangerous obsession, and total overacting from everyone else.When some films are released, you just know from the get go that they are going to be rubbish, but no matter how many bad reviews you read, or the poor office the film has garnered, you want to see it, but for all the wrong reasons.This is one of those films, Mortdecai was another, but that was boring, insufferable rubbish. This on the other hand is also rubbish, with an incoherent script and narrative, but my word, its never boring, and unintentionally brilliantly hilarious.As soon as you hear that the love interest is supposed to be nineteen, you throw any plausibility away, because he look like he's about twenty eight, and sticks out like a sore thumb whenever he's in school, and on that Subject, Lopez just doesn't convince as a teacher, she's not the worst actress in the world, but hearing her and her 'knowledge' will make you balk.Other than that, its just a failed attempt to recapture the essence of those erotic thrillers that featured Michael Douglas and others in the late eighties and Early Nineties, but the result is more straight to video ham starring Marc Singer and Joan Severance.The audience are spoon fed plot points, like something important used in the final scenes is featured prominently in an early scene, thanks to some dodgy camera-work, and we are also spoon fed that fact that Claire is a strong woman, because she has a go at a date because he uses a derogatory term toward females, that any self respecting person would speak up against.And finally, the best scene in the film, the punch bag training, which leads to an injection of epinephrine, is just so wrong, so incorrect, in so many ways, it may just be a scene of pure genius.If you love bad films, I highly recommend this, if you want to watch a psycho thriller that really connects with the audience, go for Fatal Attraction.",The Boy Next Door

For a big screen version of a Lifetime thriller this delivers exactly what it promises to. Don't set your standards high and it's mindlessly entertaining especially if you look on it as a comedy. In fact it's so obvious and ridiculous that it is laugh out loud funny in parts. The love scene is quite risqué, the boy turning psycho is too sudden and exaggerated and the grand climax fight scene is bordering on absurd.The supporting cast is good. It's good to see Kristen Chenoweth in a different kind of role as the best friend. She is quite droll in her own way too. John Corbett plays against type as the unfaithful husband. Jennifer herself acts as well as this role demands isn't as glamorous as expected given some reviews. She does have some chemistry with her costar Ryan Guzman of Step Up. He looks a little mature for high school but it is explained.

As a result, the neighbor gets violent and stalks her.It is a fast-pace thriller with steamy love scenes and quick action sequences. However, the plot is predictable and the acting is sub-par at best.

18,Hellmant,The script might have started out as something more interesting.,3,21 April 2015,"'THE BOY NEXT DOOR': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman star in this 'FATAL ATTRACTION'-esque B-movie thriller. Lopez plays a high-school teacher, and recently cheated on mother, who has an affair with a 17-year-old neighbor kid; who then develops a dangerous obsession with her. The film also stars John Corbett, Ian Nelson, Kristin Chenoweth and Lexi Atkins (who also recently co-starred in the zombie spoof 'ZOMBEAVERS'). It was directed by Rob Cohen (the director of such popular B-action movies as 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS', 'XXX', 'STEALTH', 'THE SKULLS' and 'ALEX CROSS') and it was written by former criminal lawyer, turned first time feature film writer, Barbara Curry. It's a painfully bad movie!Lopez plays Claire Peterson; a mother, and high school teacher, who was recently cheated on by her husband, Garrett (Corbett). A 17- year- old orphan, named Noah Sandborn (Guzman), moves in with his uncle (Jack Wallace), after his parents are killed in an automobile accident. Noah seems polite, and very charming, so one night, when Claire is feeling desperate, she has a one-night stand with him. She realizes her mistake right away and tries to end it with the kid, but he becomes angry and obsessive. He befriends her son, Kevin (Nelson), and enrolls in Claire's class at school. Things then become very dark, twisted and violent; very quickly. Curry originally wrote the screenplay about a high school teacher having an affair with a 12-year-old neighbor boy. Cohen thought that was too disturbing though, for mainstream audiences, and it would make the heroine seem too unsympathetic; so he changed the 'boy next door' to a 17-year-old troubled teen. The movie would have been a lot more believable if the filmmakers had left the ages the same. As it is, it seems really ridiculous and preposterous; most of the time. The Noah character isn't believable or realistic in the slightest; nor are any of the relationships depicted in the movie. Lopez and Guzman also give horrible performances (the two worst of the entire film) and the directing is pretty bad as well. The script might have started out as something more interesting but it wasn't developed into a smart, clever or even entertaining psychological thriller (at all). It's just painful to watch and a complete waste of time (other than Lexi Atkins and Ian Nelson, who both give decent performances in the film).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/rxD9sln4Qkg",The Boy Next Door
19,Buddy-51,Has Hollywood no new ideas anymore?,4,26 June 2015,"Sort of a gender-reverse version of ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""Swimfan"" and the like, ""The Boy Next Door"" features Jennifer Lopez as an older woman with a shaky marriage who gets involved with the smooth-talking, lantern-jawed teenage hunk who's just moved into the neighborhood. Of course, Lopez is an ""older"" woman in the same sense that 26-year- old Ryan Guzman - who looks like he just stepped off the cover of Men's Fitness Magazine - is a teenager, but we'll let that slide. At any rate, Noah enrolls in one of Lopez' classes - he's a big fan of the Greek classics, you know - so he can benefit further from Ms. Peterson's ""expertise"" and ""instruction."" (In case you were wondering, Lopez is no more convincing as an English teacher than she is as an older woman). And, oh yea, did I mention - as if I needed to - that Noah turns out to be a bit of a raging psychotic?Well, before you know it, Noah has become the unlikely best friend of Lopez' dorky son, Kevin (Ian Nelson), and he begins filling the impressionable lad's head with subversive thoughts about his dad (John Corbett), whose plan to reconcile with his wife makes him a direct threat to Noah's rather poorly-thought-out scheme to start a new life with this less-than-cooperative Mrs. Robinson. You can pretty much write the screenplay yourself from there.More a premise for a MLF porn movie than a feature film in its own right, ""The Boy Next Door"" piles one implausibility on top of another on its way to a preposterous conclusion.

20,thesar-2,The MILF Only Rang Once,3,31 December 2015,"Even with only 91 minutes, this movie seriously took me three attempts to finishin as many months.This is sad, because I generally don't pick up where I left off when I ditch a movie for another shot later. So, I've seen the first 35-50 minutes now three times, which is three times too many for anyone.And yet, it's not the worst of 2015. Sure, it's bad, clichéd, formulaic, has both editing flaws and script problems, predictable to the end, blah, blah, but hey, people seem to like the repetitive stuff this year (SEE: Creed, Star Wars VII, Jurassic World, etc, etc) and the title character: sodamnhot. I know, I know, not a reason to like a movie – there's Tumblr and Grindr for that. But, that did help in addition to: I didn't overall hate it. It's the same story of many stalker/fatal attraction films, so you know where this is going, but it didn't anger me as most of these do. Nor did I have the high expectations of this and was let down as I repeatedly was this year. (Again, SEE: Creed, Star Wars VII, Jurassic World, etc, etc.)It's a ""rainy, stay-in night with nothing else in your queue and you can manage to leave your brain at the door"" movie. Well, make that, keep some of your brain intact to remember the hunkness of ""the boy"" (at the time 27-year-old,) Ryan Guzman.",The Boy Next Door
21,Robert_duder,Awful...period,3,30 April 2015,"Not all poorly reviewed movies are bad...some films that critics and viewers hated, I thought was fantastic. I am firmly in the majority camp on this one. The Boy Next Door is awful. Its barely a made-for-TV quality film that you can't even enjoy for camp quality because its just awful. This is not a new genre, in fact its a tried and true genre that has been done so much better even when it is ""bad"" FEAR, Swimfan, Single White Female...we've seen it all before and almost all of them are ridiculously entertaining even if they are silly. We like a thriller with a touch of horror and its even better when we can believe our psycho is truly psychotic. The Boy Next Door feels cheap, slapped together, and like everyone involved did nothing to make this worthwhile. Given its 4 million dollar budget, it almost certainly made money and that's a shame because this is the type of junk that should be banned from our theatres. I am giving it a 3 but don't take that as an admission of some sort of redeemable quality. I am only giving it that because it had a few moments that were tolerable but that's it.I know that Jennifer Lopez gets a lot of flack for her acting skills but you know what I have enjoyed many of her films. She is a genre specific princess having done very well in romantic comedies and I can't think of a single film of hers that I haven't at least enjoyed. I don't know what she was thinking with this crap. She even produced it?! She is better than this and should be ashamed. Her character is weak, annoying and does nothing to prove she is a strong woman. Ryan Guzman is out nut-case and the boy next door. This is a good opportunity for any actor to prove he can be downright creepy and Guzman is okay but he is too campy and ridiculous and there is no arc to his character. He goes from horny to crazy in 5 seconds. There is no chemistry between he and Lopez and he doesn't impress. Ian Nelson, John Corbett and Kristin Chenoweth round out the supporting cast. I KNOW Corbett is better than this and Chenoweth is more talented than this too but her character is fine but underused and underdeveloped.This is actually my 1700th review and usually I try to make each 100 films I review mean something so I'm sort of dropping the ball here because this film means not much of anything. I actually considered seeing this in theatre with my wife because I thought it would be a fun date night movie but there isn't anything fun about it. It was poorly made and slapped together. I just don't understand why the people involved did this film. Director Rob Cohen has been at the helm of some significant films in the action genre and has a lot of experience and this just feels like something everyone did because they were forced to somehow. Definitely not worth your time, take my word for it, in a crowded thriller/stalker genre, there are tons of films better than this drudge. 3/10",The Boy Next Door
22,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Starts well, but by the end has become laughably bad",4,8 July 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Clare Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) is a high school English teacher, who's just gone through a painful divorce. One day, she has a chance encounter with Noah (Ryan Guzman), a striking young man who's just moved in next door with his ailing grand-father. One night, in a moment of weakness, Clare allows Noah to seduce her, and they end up spending a passionate night together. When Clare comes to her senses the next morning, it sets in motion a chain of events that reveal Noah's true psychopathic nature, which threatens Clare and all she holds dear.The 'seemingly friendly stranger who turns in to a psycho' theme was a familiar device in a lot of early '90s psychological thrillers, such as Single White Female and Pacific Heights, and is a welcome return after being away for so long. Aside from that, the idea of an inappropriate relationship between an older person (especially a woman!) in a responsible position and someone else, is an interesting idea to explore in the medium of film. The Boy Next Door certainly sets it's foundations pretty well, setting a nice build-up for what could be a good thriller, but after the forbidden love interlude between Lopez and Guzman, it rapidly goes downhill.The effect of the film is like one of the Wright Brothers test flying one of their new planes, only to see it have a smooth start, before spiralling out of control, catching fire mid air, then crashing and burning to the ground. Once Noah's stalking starts, the film becomes so relentlessly hammy, overblown and increasingly nonsensical, that by the end, it's lost all semblance of credibility and is just a complete laughing stock. Tellingly, it's all wrapped up in just under an hour and a half, which just about summarises the speed of it's descent from the sky. Truly a wasted opportunity. **",The Boy Next Door

One night things go a little too far and Claire regrets it. Noah becomes angry at her regret and lives are affected. This is another movie that is pretty much what you would expect. The movie is pretty tense and entertaining but was lacking something, for me at least, to make it as tense as the movie was going for. I had a hard time not comparing this movie to Fear, and because of that I didn't think this was as good and had a hard time fully committing to this one. All that said though, the movie is pretty good and I do think it's worth watching. Overall, not as good as Fear, but one of the better Jennifer Lopez movies I have seen. Definitely worth seeing.

25,westsideschl,Badddd!,1,16 June 2015,"Non-creative writing as this plot line has been done, almost exactly, numerous times before. Five minutes in you know where the story is going. Add in a genre listed as thriller, now the ending is already mapped out for you. The usual 3-way tumultuous romance with frustrated teen in the middle (usually female, but male this time). Ending was just a series of predictable yet improbable, really improbable, sequence of events. Why is it in movies that when a smaller person (usually female) knocks out the bigger, badder adversary their next move is a ""make- no-sense-dumb"" go do something else with back turned? In this case, despite being hit with a crowbar with a force that would have broken a metal chair baddie is back to normal a minute later. Help, oh incredulity master!Add in robotic acting (can we call it acting?) augmented by the ""cat out of the bag"" scripting technique to rescue the acting using short sentences with short words. That brings us to Lopez's main contribution which is to allow properly chosen camera angles and attire to show her primary assets in the best light. A little spray-on sweat didn't do any harm; also a little spray-on to show off the self narcissistic body promotion of the guy next door. Speaking of that subject the current trend in film and TV (witness: DeGeneres show) is abs, muscles and tight fitting T's to make money off of a certain frustrated female demographic.",The Boy Next Door
26,vincentlynch-moonoi,Flawed but incredibly suspenseful film,7,8 November 2015,"Although there are a couple of problems with this film, I thought it was quite a bit better than the average rating here.Let's start with the problems. The biggest problem of all is Kristin Chenoweth as the vice principal. This may be the most totally ridiculous casting I have ever seen in a film. The auto accident segment, though fairly brief, is also illogical. And, the way the administrators of the school handle the slightly odd situations, and then the photos and videos of sex is just not realistic at all...and I say that as a retired principal.On the positive side of things is the casting of Ryan Guzman as the sexual predator/student/neighbor. In this role, Guzman is spooky! And I mean SPOOKY! Great portrayal of a psychological disorder -- perhaps schizophrenia. I'm never quite sure of the acting ability of Jennifer Lopez...I always feel she is just ""competent"", and sort of feel that way here; let's just say she does fairly well here. Ian Nelson, as the son, is quite good here. John Corbett is fine as the father.I think the plot is quite well constructed. A very mature high school student is actually a violent predator, and his next target is his next door neighbor and a teacher. The question isn't where the film is going. That's rather obvious. The question is how will be get there and how will the situation be resolve.Despite the problems I discussed already, this is a very suspenseful film. If you like this sort of thing -- recommended.",The Boy Next Door
27,leonblackwood,Very basic with no thrills. 3/10,3,2 August 2015,"Review: This is a very simplistic movie about a woman who falls for her next door neighbour, only to find out that he's a lunatic with an obsessive nature. Claire, (Jennifer Lopez), quickly comes to her senses, after her brief moment of weakness, and she tries to convince Noah (Ryan Guzman) that there is no way that they can have a relationship. Noah doesn't take her denial that well and his bad temper sends him into a rage which puts Claire, her family and friends life's in danger. Pretty straight forward really! Right from the beginning, you can tell how the whole film is going to pan out and the acting wasn't that great. You do end up sticking with the film, just to see how far Noah goes with his psychopathic behaviour but the ending seemed a bit over the top. When things started to get out of hand, I don't understand why Claire didn't just call the police because I'm sure that Noah would have had a record. Personally, I'm surprised that the movie made such a profit at the box office because it's very basic with no major twists. There is some intensity throughout the movie and Jennifer Lopez has been out of the spotlight for sometime so I'm sure those aspects contributed to the movie being a success. Average!Round-Up: At 46 years old, Jennifer Lopez is still looking good but she has slowed down in the latter part of her acting career. In 2013 she starred in Parker with Jason Statham and in 2012 she was in What To Expect When Your Expecting so she hasn't made that many movies recently. She still has Lila & Eve coming out later this year, starring Viola Davis but she doesn't have any projects lined up. Anyway, this film was directed by Rob Cohen who brought you films like The Fast & Furious, xXx, Alex Cross, The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor, Dragonheart and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, so he has quite an impressive back catalogue. Personally, I don't think that he got the most out of the actors and Lopez seemed a bit too glamorous for her role but that just my personal opinion. Anyway, this movie is basically what it says on the tin so don't expect anything that amazing.Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: $51millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thrillers about a woman who has a moment of weakness with the boy next door which leads to a string of events that puts her life in danger. 3/10",The Boy Next Door
28,DarkVulcan29,A poor persons Fatal Attraction,5,27 January 2015,"Ever since Fatal Attraction(1987) hit theaters, It seems that a bunch of other films tried to copy that type premise, like The Crush(1993), and Swimfan(2002) to name a few. There have been highs and lows.Jennifer Lopez plays a high school teacher separated from her husband(John Corbett), and trying to be a good mother to her teenage son. Begins a friendship with a handsome young man(Ryan Guzman), but regrets after a one night of wild sex with him. She tells him it was a mistake, but the craziness in him begins to emerge.Some jump scares are pretty cool, but this film never comes off very interesting, Jennifer Lopez is just being Jennifer Lopez, I've seen other films where she gives a better performance. And Ryan Guzman is alright, but the moments where he tries to act crazy, he comes across like he is trying to hard, and does not send off the creepy vibe like Glenn Close did in Fatal Attraction. John Corbett does alright with some scenes he was in. It was a poor persons Fatal Attraction like I said.",The Boy Next Door

Jennifer plays a high school teacher-Not like any teacher I remember, but it has been a while since I was in high school- that is having marital problems with John. It seems that he had a fling with another woman-and he was married to Jennifer Lopez?-so they are separated, trying to work things out. Ryan is a teen-almost 20-that moves in next door with his sick uncle. Late one night, Jennifer is drinking and feeling a little depressed-she is all alone and raising a teenager by herself-and Ryan comforts her and, well, things get a little out of hand and they end up in bed. FYI: Jennifer does her own sex scenes. The next morning, Jennifer realizes her mistake-Duh!-and tells Ryan that she is sorry about what happened and it won't happen again. Ryan does not take rejection very well, and starts with the fatal attraction bit of stalking Jennifer; he joins her class at school, becomes friends with her son, talks bad about John in front of the son, and when all of that doesn't change Jennifer's mind about continuing their relationship, he really goes off the deep end. Kristen plays Jennifer's boss/friend at the school and she doesn't like Ryan from the beginning, so you know good things are not in store for her. It is a little predictable, a little cheesy, but, it is entertaining. It's rated ""R"" for violence, sexual content-including nudity, both partial of Jennifer and full of another girl-and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",The Boy Next Door

The acting was mostly adequate, given the material. I had never heard of this Ryan Guzman, and will be surprised if I hear of him again. He was, well, adequate, but his was a role that an accomplished actor would sink his teeth into, and not relent until ALL of the scenery was masticated. Guzman was unable to be scary enough, creepy enough, or charming enough. Blah. Which brings me to Jennifer Lopez. I think she has become a pretty good actress, even though it is hard to tell in this one, due to the script. But I see that she has a producer credit. Can you not tell from a script that a film will be a dud? I'm actually asking. I do not know, having never read a script.

First of all, I loved the casting for this movie, Jennifer Lopez did a great job as the lead role, and let's not forget our psychopath, Ryan Guzman, he really played his role well, nice and creepy, with a twisted edge to him. Kristin Chenoweth was very pleasant playing Jennifer Lopez's best friend and co-worker, and in my opinion, just added to the movie, Ian Nelson, who played Jennifer's teenage son was impressive in his role, no complaints here! There were several scenes where I was genuinely creeped out, and on the edge of my seat, which was this movies job, so I feel like it accomplished it's job.

One day, a handsome strapping boy Noah, moves in next door, befriends Claire's shy sickly son, does the manly work around her house. Seduction led vulnerable Claire into bed with Noah, which led to a guilty conscience. However, Noah simply would not accept NO for an answer anymore.Ever since her return to the limelight via American Idol, Jennifer Lopez is still trying to convince all of us that she is still hot and sexy even past age 40. I will not deny that she really is. She does not really need to resort to in-your-face tactics to do it, but she does. Lately, she had that trashy ""Booty"" song and video, more revelatory deeply-plunging gowns at award shows, and now this vanity project which she herself produced.JLo is ever-glamorous in this film, with perfectly coiffed hair, impeccable make-up and stylish outfits all the time. She exudes ""sexy"" in all her scenes, even when she was just lounging around her living room posing on her divan, or slyly peeking out her upstairs window into the privacy of her neighbor's bedroom. Her anticipated bed scene was mostly moaning and teasing in the shadows, which will disappoint those came to see more of her. Her acting is not bad as you may think. She did what the script told her to do, as embarrassing as those lines and scenes were. As the 19-year old title character Noah, 27-year old Ryan Guzman was the ideal charming lover boy in the first half, and the unshakable nightmare in the second half, both personas played with obvious relish. The way this film closed the camera in on his biceps and torso and behind, it seemed this movie was made for cougars and ""mommy porn"" book fans in mind. To be fair, Guzman registers very well on the big screen, with charisma like Ryan Phillippe or Freddie Prinze, Jr. in their heyday. Let us see if he can get on with his career after this.Kristin Chenoweth does not sing here, but her character was a lot of fun of watch. Silly and kooky, she does not exactly convince us that she was the assistant principal of her school. Her Vicky was an interesting side character. Too bad she did not get to do too much, or else the movie would have ended earlier. She provides most of the comic relief of the film, the intended ones. Director Rob Cohen did not really have to worry about humor, his whole film was actually peppered with unintentionally (?) hilarious moments. The way Claire and Noah would finish each others sentences as they discussed Homer, the way Noah gifted Claire with a fresh-looking first edition of ""The Iliad"", the list goes on. And top it all off, the film ends an over-the-top fiery, eye-popping Armageddon in an isolated barn. I had to stifle my LOL during those final fight scenes.In the final verdict, this movie was, in its own shallow way, entertaining. It was bad, but not annoyingly bad. Razzies are likely forthcoming next year for this, but hey, I bet you will have some mindless naughty fun while watching it. 4/10.",The Boy Next Door

Noah is the nephew of the old guy next door and offers to go the hardware store with Kevin to buy parts to fix the door. Kevin is insecure and allergic. Claire is separated from her cheating husband but not divorced. He stops by to spend time with Kevin. Claire's friend, played by the catastrophically malnourished Chenoweth, tries to set her up with men. We learn that both of Noah's parents died in a car accident, so now he's living with the uncle who's about to undergo a bone marrow transplant. Claire happens to to be a literature teacher at the high school. Her interest is the Classics. So is Noah's who will enter the same school as a senior.Now good friends with Kevin, Noah spends a lot of time at the house and starts getting more and more seductive with Claire until he manages to get her to have sex with him, even though for no good reason she protests until the very last second how wrong it is.While Claire sees the episode as a one-time mistake, Noah apparently is in love and wants her for himself. So when he spends time with Kevin he undermines his relationship with the dad. And sure enough, the impressionable Kevin falls for it, almost getting himself and the dad killed while driving the awesome purple Dodge Challenger. Since Claire doesn't respond to Noah, he gets crazier and more aggressive. He lets her know he has photos and videos of their encounter. One day he plasters her classroom full of the pictures. That forces Claire with her friend to deceive Noah. While he follows the friend in Claire's car, Claire breaks into his house to grab the evidence and finds the typical crazy guy's lair who has the walls covered in pictures of Claire. Things get more violent and dangerous until she confronts him.Every couple of years we get these obsessed lover videos and they usually work--you get the likable attractive victim and the attractive but demented lover. The problem is that all these movies go overboard crazy, instead of going for subtlety, which would be so much more effective. They should take their inspiration from The Gift (2015) to see how subdued tension works much better. I have noting against Lopez as an actress. She's beautiful especially when she gets to smile and be playful, like in this movie. I enjoy her teenage girl voice, too, but not when she tries to sing. The Claire character here is interesting, because she's too good-natured and I guess all along she has a crush on Noah that she's not able to be more aggressive herself in putting an end to things quickly. This movie is well directed and looks good too. It portrays complicated family life well and is even critical of the money-above-all-else mindset. It works well but doesn't offer anything to truly stand out among others of its kind.",The Boy Next Door

It is far from a masterpiece and is never trying to be something that is ""Best Picture"" or ""Best Movie of the Year."" Then again, it has accomplished what most Hollywood movies with a budget of over 50 million can't be....a good story. If you know what to expect from The Boy Next Door, then this movie is worth watching. Filmed on a low budget, it will successfully make a profit and make some good and bad news in the press. I only wish there would be more good discussion than bad. I would not consider this a ""Lifetime"" movie. For starters, most of what Lifetime makes is crap. The Boy Next Door is better in its story, its filming and its acting. The movie does fall short in certain areas, but who cares. This is not an epic or a movie that is trying to change the world. The audience who wants a sexy thriller is going to be very happy with this movie. Where are the Critics that will mention everything good about this movie? Director Rob Cohen did not have 100 million dollars to work with. Instead he took a modest budget and showed that he can direct. Jennifer Lopez, 45 years young and looks sexier than ever, still delivers a worthy performance. Ryan Guzman and Ian Nelson show amazing talent. Both were unknowns until this movie. Because of their performances, both have long and successful careers ahead of them. John Corbett once again takes a chance on a low budget (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) film and comes out with gold.

39,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Boy Next Door,4,24 January 2015,"It's just weird seeing Jennifer Lopez staked out at the Academy Awards or the Golden Globes. She's never been nominated for anything, never been in a flick that could be deemed critically noteworthy, and hasn't won any kind of accolades pertaining to the world of acting. But there she is in a skimpy dress, hobnobbing with the likes of Meryl Streep, and avoiding various ex-husbands and ex-boyfriends (you just know that either Ben Affleck or P. Diddy is probably in the audience). After seeing her latest, faulty cadaver (2015's The Boy Next Door), someone should have told her to hightail it to another awards ceremony, the almighty Razzies (if you didn't already know, this is recognition of the worst in film).Now from the opening hint of a teaser trailer to the obviousness of the camera panning down to J. Lo's famous tush, it's clear that she's parodying herself in the worst way here. It's like she's inviting her ""Jenny from the Block"" persona to a level of surmised scrutinization. Anyway, Lopez wears enough lip gloss to power a small country in her role as Claire Peterson. In The Boy Next Door, Claire is a high school teacher, a responsible mother, and a woman who is separated from her cheating husband (John Corbett in the thankless role as Garrett Peterson). Claire lives with her son Kevin (played by Ian Nelson) and trades barbs with vice principal Vicky Lansing (the annoying, token girlfriend who doesn't have a life of her own and is played by Cameron Diaz look-alike, Kristin Chenoweth). From the beginning of ""Boy Next Door"", Claire discovers that she has two neighbors. They are a dying uncle and his nineteen year-old, great-nephew Noah Sandborn (played by Ryan Guzman). As the Lopez character begins to take Noah in, befriend him, and let the young buck hang out with her son, she actually partakes in bad judgement by having a brief romantic tryst with him (kind of like art imitating life, huh J. Lo). She then rejects his later advances causing Noah to make her life a living hell. He stalks her, harasses her, actually enrolls in her English class (he's obviously too old for high school, strange), and exhibits some seriously violent behavior. Meanwhile, Claire doesn't bother to go to the police and Noah's uncle is oblivious to his great-nephew's shenanigans (you'd think he'd know by now if the young punk had some psychotic tendencies).The Boy Next Door as a movie, is artificially staunch. Rob Cohen directs and his results are nothing less than uninspired (look for a scene where some poor audio dubbing is used, who would have thunk it). He veers away from his more complex and flashy work with The Fast and the Furious to churning out bad camp that resembles something more along the lines of his 2000 vehicle, The Skulls. He wants to give his audience a modern day Fatal Attraction. Instead, he fashions ninety-one minutes without any sense of depth not to mention a laughable ending that has 2006's Swimfan written all over it (its been a long time since that dud's been mentioned). I mean, it's hard for me to figure out why this thing was even made. It's not based on a book, or a true story, or anything. I guess it was relegated on a concept from the mind of screenwriter Barbara Curry. Some concept. ""Boy Next Door"" is not entertainingly bad, it's just bad period. It takes about twenty minutes for antagonist Noah to go all habitual psycho and Guzman plays him by overacting blandly (I didn't think this was possible). You as the audience member, are supposed to fear his reluctant baby face but you just silently end up laughing at him.Oh and what would a disposable January release be without some movie clichés. ""Boy Next Door's"" got em' like the adage where the cops show up late after all the killings and violent, physical confrontations have already occurred. And you gotta have the obligatory jump scares via a screeching cat plus a villain who just won't stay down (Noah gets hit over the head multiple times, stabbed in the eye, and kicked in the nards but just keeps a comin'). About forty-five minutes into ""Boy Next Door"", Noah fractures a bully's skull, gets expelled from high school, and yet Claire becomes reprimanded by the school's principal for grabbing his arms in the gymnasium (ah huh). If characters are manipulated by the mechanics in the script, then The Boy Next Door would resonate as the be- all end-all (the actor who plays Claire's son Kevin changes his personality on a dime but then again, he is a lost teenager).In hindsight, you can tell that this is strictly a J. Lo marketed affair. She produced it, she stars in it, and it's catered to her aura (if you wanna call it that). She's not a horrible enchantress by any means but if she continues to churn out crud like this, she'll always be a bridesmaid, never a bride when it comes to actress recognition.

40,raulfaust,Love doesn't cost a thing... or sometimes it does?,5,18 April 2015,"Well, I've seen a lot of suspenseful movies throughout my life, and while watching this one, a lot of others came into my mind. A beautiful guy appears in a girl's life (in this case, in a woman's), and after some days, he begins to show what a psycho he is in fact. That premise was used in at least 10 different films, and I'd point out for 1996's ""Fear"" and 2009's ""The Stepfather"". Also, the spying on the window strongly reminded me of 2007's ""Disturbia"", reason why I feel right in stating that ""The Boy Next Door"" has NO originality whatsoever. The cast is very superficial; Ryan Guzman, for instance, is that clichéd perfect guy who seems to have came out of a model agency, given that he looks more like Justin Bieber than like Hannibal. Jennifer Lopez, sadly, appears to enjoy playing the sufferer housewife whose life is always destroyed by a male psycho, considering she has already played that part plenty of times. For that reasons, I consider ""The Boy Next Door"" to be a regularly bad film, albeit I'm able to admit that many teenagers are likely to enjoy this picture due to their naivety.",The Boy Next Door
41,moviexclusive,"Playing like a reverse 'Fatal Attraction', this sexual thriller starring a still-hot Jennifer Lopez is generic and predictable but never less than watchable",5,23 January 2015,"Like its subject matter, 'The Boy Next Door' is getting such a hush- hush treatment it almost seems as if someone didn't want you to see it. If that is any indication that someone was embarrassed by how this reverse 'Fatal Attraction' thriller turned out, well we're glad to say that it isn't as bad as we had feared. To be sure, that should not be mistaken for any endorsement of its merit, but given how little pre-release publicity its distributors bestowed upon it, we were sure expecting something much, much worse.In her first big-screen role in two years, Jennifer Lopez plays a middle-aged high-school literature teacher who is still struggling to recover emotionally from her husband's (John Corbett) betrayal one year on and raising her teenage son, Kevin (Ian Nelson, on her own. Enter new neighbour Noah (Step Up's Ryan Guzman), who has moved in next door with his ailing uncle and proves himself to be quite the fix-it hero around her place, especially since Garrett's (Corbett) absence means that there is a space for a man to be around the house. Even better, Noah loves poetry and his intimate knowledge of Homer's 'The Iliad' becomes one of the first few things over which he and Claire (Lopez) develop a connection over.There is however no mistaking their (mutual) sexual attraction, not when director Rob Cohen introduces Noah bicep-first when he glides into frame to prepare Claire's wonky garage door. When Kevin takes off with Garrett for a weekend camping trip and Claire's had one drink too many after a failed dinner date, Noah seizes the opportunity to get it on with Claire. The morning after, Claire wakes to proclaim their coupling a mistake – no matter that Guzman looks older than he is meant to be in the movie, he is a new transfer senior attending Claire's class at her school. Her rebuff doesn't sit well with Noah, whom we slowly learn is in fact a psychotic stalker who grows even more enraged when he catches her responding to Garrett's advances to give their marriage a second chance.First-time screenwriter Barbara Curry slowly ratchets up the stakes against Claire – first, Noah 'poisons' Kevin's relationship with his father; then, he threatens to make public photos and even a video of their one-night dalliance; then, he sabotages the brakes on Garrett's Dodger; and finally, he kidnaps Garrett and Kevin – which Cohen builds up as an increasingly thrilling chain of events leading up to their final confrontation. Not only does Noah prove himself to be a master manipulator, he also shows himself to be prone to bouts of violence, in particular against Claire's good friend and the school's vice principal (Kristin Chenoweth).That said, it isn't anything we haven't yet before, or done to more titillating extremes; yet, despite its familiarity, Cohen guides the proceedings along with the sure hand of a veteran, and it is to his credit that the end result is much more engaging than it ought to be. We're not sure what Lopez saw in the material for her to not only star but produce this rehash of 90s exploitation thrillers, but she at least makes her character sympathetic. The same however cannot be said of Guzman, whose portrayal of menace and malevolence doesn't go much deeper than the acting you'll see in a high school play. And for those who are expecting to see Lopez and Guzman get hot and heavy, well let's just say that you're likely to find yourself left cold.It is probably too easy to lambast a movie like 'The Boy Next Door', but the truth is there are many worse films out there which deserve to be buried more so than this does. The premise does feel dated, but there hasn't been a sexual thriller like 'Basic Instinct' or for that matter 'Fatal Attraction' in a while, so if you're in the mood for some trashy B-grade thrills, you'll probably find some of those urges satisfied somewhat by this teaser that never does really get past first base.",The Boy Next Door
42,quincytheodore,"Plot made of stalker movie cliché, Carly Rae Jepsen's video clip and softcore porn.",3,6 February 2015,"Let's face it, you must here to see Jennifer Lopez running from some psycho in her night gown or equally revealing outfit because the poster indicated such prospect. If that's the case, there isn't much aside from flirtation and edited illusion of what may come mainly on the first act, and if you're here for scare or horror, bless you. The Boy Next Door is virtually the same type of movie since Mark Whalberg's Fear almost two decades ago, only worse and without any depth or innovation.Jennifer Lopez's cinematic career is far less successful than her monumental achievement in music, and unless she starts singing exclusive songs as she runs in the movie, which she obviously doesn't, it's a bit optimistic to hope she could carry a horror movie by her own. She was decent at Parker, but her overall track record isn't consistent. Here without any veteran actors or quality script, it's hard to expect excellent performance, let alone on horror genre, which she's not familiar with.The movie is incredibly predictable down to a fault. Entirely predictable without any build on suspense, the titular boy next door seems nice at first, but turns out to be a real maniac. He hunts her, she's scared. It's very bland and uninspiring, not to mention many other movies of similar theme has done better in setting the thrill. At time it's even unintentionally funny with excessive wailing and less than optimal cinematography.Production is very basic, Jennifer Lopez in a simple suburb neighborhood with a few other supporting cast. Don't expect too much stylish cinematography or atmospheric ambiance, much of its gore or dramatic sequences are done modestly. It does attempt to bring more subplots with personal aspects with the family and some scenes are rather unsettling because the inappropriate nature, but these never materialize into more than unimaginative humdrum jump scares.With Jennifer Lopez starring and also producing the movie, it might create a buzz at least more than your usual horror B-movies could hope for, but many people will be surely disappointed. A footage of her as herself fighting real stalker with ""based on true story"" slapped on the cover would've been much better.",The Boy Next Door
43,Terryfan,It started off with promises only to get a disappointed,5,31 December 2015,Yes I watch this movie mostly out of boredom and to see what it was about.While the film did have something going for it being a stalker thriller it would have been so much more better it's just the film's climax that really ruins the film.The climax is just another example of how you can just destroy the filmThe plot of the film centers around Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) who new neighbor Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman) begins to take new interest in her which leads into the two being caught in a dangerous game which leads to surprises and mind games.As the plot goes on we see the dangers of being stalked.While the film's music is bone chilling and gives your nerves going along with the plot just makes you go that's insane It's just that there were scenes that could have been better not having and again it's the film's climax that just turns me off from this movie and more or less not watch again I give The Boy Next Door an 5 out of 10,The Boy Next Door
44,Screen_Blitz,A complete mess,1,24 January 2015,"This erotic thriller starring Jennifer Lopez is definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in recent history. Some movies can be panned critics and still be somewhat entertaining. This movie is NOT one of them. The acting was horrendous (especially at the end), the plot was absolutely cheesy, and the whole script was pretty much chaos. This film was like a rip-off of movies like Fatal Attraction or American Psycho.Jennifer Lopez plays Claire, a mother who is dealing with marriage problems and is a teaches English at a high school. Noah, a young man in his late teens, moves next door and befriends her son, Kevin. After having a sexual encounter with her, Noah grows an obsessive relationship with her and begins exhibiting violent behavior such as brutally beating another student and turning Kevin away from his father. Just about every scene in the movie was predictable. There were no elements of surprise whatsoever, there wasn't even anything remotely scary about it. Most of what we get is nude shots of Jennifer's Lopez's body and gratuitous sex scenes. The acting was so awful that it would make you laugh. The fight scene were unrealistic and looked as if the actors didn't know what they were doing and had to constantly had be directed by the camera man.I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless they are a die hard Jennifer Lopez fan.",The Boy Next Door
45,jromanbaker,Dross,1,24 October 2019,"Infidelity. Oral sex. Argument. Keywords for this film ? No mention of the horror and the extreme violence of the film, and also the UK DVD has an 18 certificate and the certification here says 15. No fifteen year old should see this film, as one of the victims of the deranged young man is about that age. What he sees and experiences in the final scenes of this dross would once upon a time have been toned down but given this is normal 21st Century viewing why should it be ? Every time I turn on late night films on television I see fragments, and worse than what I sat through here. So why did I watch it ? A friend brought it over and says this is fun and to please this friendly acquaintance I watched it with him. By the end I felt sick of what our current society considers entertainment. In films like this the woman pays for her adultery ( she is separated from her husband ) and of course she has to run the gauntlet of abuse, seeing people close to her tortured, one to death but never fear at the end the family unit is saved!!! The typical American trope that makes all the horror ' come out alright '. The disturbed torturer ( never mind really why he got that way ) gets his ' just ' punishment and here the camera really loves to see his suffering. I will take a risk on this being a spoiler. As for the acting I will not be generous as it was lamentably awful. The direction had no tension, just assault tactics. I sat through Pasolini's ' Salo ' and was revolted, but there were in my opinion justifiable reasons for the horrors there. There was no justification for this, except for the conservative view that a woman of a certain age should never go with a young man of twenty. I suppose for this crime she deserved what she got!!! Despite the fact that the inevitable ' pretty ' boy looked older. This whole mess merits a zero, so I give myself I for being polite to a friend and sitting through it.",The Boy Next Door
46,TOMASBBloodhound,Basically a Lifetime Network caliber movie with a higher budget.,3,6 September 2015,"Why on Earth does Jennifer Lopez waste her time with films like this? She's no Meryl Streep in terms of acting, but she's good enough to make better films that this one. Or Enough, which may have been worse. But not only did she star in this weak vehicle, she is also credited as a producer of it! Lopez is likable, charismatic, and beautiful beyond description, so can't she find better projects?Lopez plays a high school teacher, trying to raise a teenage son while currently finding herself estranged from her husband. And right at the start of a new school year, this studly-looking kid moves into the house next door, apparently to help an elderly relative about to receive some kind of an organ transplant. Not much becomes of that subplot, and it really does nothing more than establish off the bat that the kid appears saintly. He can fix anything in the house or in the garage. And would you believe he can quote from just about any work of classic literature.... the very thing Lopez teaches?? Small world. The two houses are so close you can almost reach out from one of the many, many windows and touch the one next to it. The kid is always shirtless or even pant less and standing in a window begging her to drool over him. One night after a bottle of wine and a bad blind date, she ends up sleeping with the kid. Naturally she recognizes it as a mistake, but he falls in love. Each detail we learn about the kid reveals him to be more and more dangerous, and less and less believable as a character. Improbable scenes and plot development happen one after another, and basically once you've seen the sex scene, you've seen all there really is to see.The poor script is only part of the problem. The young man they cast as the title character is twenty-eight. They did try to laughably explain how he had been held back for some emergency, and was now actually nineteen. He doesn't look like a teenager. Not close. Rachel McAdams pulled it off at the same age in Mean Girls. But not this kid. The film actually swerves into an interesting subplot by having the boy next door kind of take Lopez's meek son under his wing, but all of this is shot out the window in an exceptionally tasteless scene. Worst of all is the film's general premise. What is so exciting about a 40- something woman getting it on with a teen - aged student. This kind of thing happens in real life every week these days. With often much younger kids! 3 of 10 stars. The 1993 film The Crush is actually much better... and it really isn't that good.The Hound.",The Boy Next Door

48,jrarichards,"Worthy in places, but also formulaic and over the top",5,2 July 2017,"Somewhere buried in Rob Cohen's 2015 film ""The Boy Next Door"" there was both a better thriller and a greater dose of eroticism waiting to get out. A pity that that potential was not realised.Given the presence of two pretty attractive actors in the (great) shape of a 45-year-old Jennifer Lopez (playing Claire Peterson) and a 27-year-old Ryan Guzman (playing Noah Sandborn), as well as a seductive enough title, those watching this film think they have a reasonably good idea what they are letting themselves in for, but - even in the work's own context - the titular ""boy"" is already 19 years old (to say nothing of the real age of the actor), and he's only lingering on in school at all because of the need to make good past misdemeanours.Hence the safeties are firmly on here, and all the more so as things move on from the first (non-sinister) part of the film to the second (highly, indeed ludicrously sinister) part.Now there is definitely merit in warning one and all that first encounters with psychopaths may (quite ""unfairly"" as it were, for the rest of us) see them achieve more-than-normal success in sociability, and in charming and pleasing and attracting those around them. However, Guzman's Sandborn is at first SO appealing, and then later SO hideously and dangerously awful, that we are seeing clichés in full action, and also sadly ignoring the increasingly-established fact of a spectrum of types of psychopaths - or rather sociopaths - since the former term (useful for normal people) is now (typically and annoyingly) rejected by the psychiatric profession.We are told that many professions have their shares of semi-psychopaths who get on because of that mindset, and don't obviously or necessarily murder (or even physically hurt) people, as the cliché might suggest. What's more, we sheeplike others may be more than willing to follow these people, especially when they turn on the charm - as they invariably do. This is worth knowing, frustrating in the extreme, and worth worrying about, I believe...How much better a film we might have had, then, had the contrast between the superficial Sandborn and his true inner self been just A BIT less extreme. But to do that would have left Claire Peterson in more of a grey area, while this film eschews ""shades of grey"" (if you'll forgive the pun). It - wrongly - endeavours to keep things clean, despite it's fully-adult language and potentially dodgy themes. (In this respect, Claire's less-than-squeaky Vice-Principal, Vicky Lansing - played gutsily by Kristin Chenoweth - comes over as more authentic at times than she does).So let's be clear - Sandborn is doing what comes naturally to him and exploiting the situation he's found himself in. His OTT criminal and evil side, not visible at all at the start, of course condemns him totally in the second part of the film, but at the outset (in what seems like a rather different, more interesting, film) he's playing it as a lusty young man (no ""boy""!) who finds himself living next door to a (mainly) unattached ""mother I'd like to ... fraternise with"". He can help with the repairs, help Claire's son man up, and he even likes (and can quote from) classical literature which Claire teaches. Annoyingly, if crucially for that second film, he later becomes a student in Claire's class, but she DOES NOT firmly know he will be her student when the pair have their (sadly one and only) hottish amorous encounter.Hence her protestations of it being ""wrong"" look a bit pale, given the presence of two unattached adults (admittedly with an age gap, but who cares?) not even at that point connected by a developed teacher-pupil relationship. Just how illicit is all this? Unforgivably, by the way, it should be noted that Clair says ""no"" to Noah's advances several times, before going on to say a big yes, plenty of times, as it were - the kind of moral/legal ambiguity that messes further with the core message of the film and is indeed quite a ""wrong"" thing for responsible film makers to do. It's also rather unfair and false of Claire, given the bald truth that she has been liking/admiring and then fancying Noah for a while now, and - in a braver film than this one - would NOT have resorted to the suggestion that Noah had (SLIGHTLY) taken advantage of her when she ""was vulnerable"", but would rather have admitted that she was thrilled and flattered and made lusty by the advances of a young stud that she was very attracted to.Not in this film, we don't! Hence, things are kept tritely clear cut. She feels guilty and regrets everything, while he goes off the rails completely, leaving her looking unambiguously ""in the right"" but also in an ""if only I'd known"" circumstance which lays waste to the touch of ambiguity and eroticism from the first part. And so to the relatively predictable second half of the film, which is done reasonably well, but offers very little that we haven't seen before (as well as a great deal that we do (actually did) see in the pretty awful 2014 Dan-Stevens-not-doing-Downton-Abbey-any-more vehicle ""The Guest""...) Mostly rather a wasted opportunity, then...",The Boy Next Door
49,bryank-04844,"'The Boy Next Door' crashed into the mountain at top speed early on. But at least this gives a new meaning to ""Taco Flavored Kisses"".",1,11 August 2015,"More often than not, January, February, and March are the three months that typically have the worst movies of the year in them. So if you're a regular movie- goer like myself, you will most likely find yourself dreading going to see movies at the start of the year. Well, those three months sure had some stinkers, but I think we have a winner for worst film of 2015 so far, which is called 'The Boy Next Door'.It's a movie you've seen done before over and over with a better polished script, good acting, and something that resembles suspense, which 'The Boy Next Door' lacks in every way possible. But I shouldn't be surprised, because the ""so-called"" talent behind this production speaks volumes. First off, the script was written by Barbara Curry (a former lawyer with no film credits to her name), who you can tell in the first 10 seconds that an eight year-old kid could have written dialogue better. Then you have director Rob Cohen in the director's seat, trying once again to turn slop into gold, but failing miserably like always. His credits include 'The Skulls', 'Stealth', 'XxX', and the recent 'Alex Cross' film. As Kevin Smith has said before, ""In Hollywood, you fail upwards"", which is very true here.The story focuses on a high-school teach named Claire (Jennifer Lopez) who has a broken marriage and a teenage son who seems to be allergic to almost everything. To make a boring and redundant story short, the next door neighbor's teenage nephew Noah (Ryan Guzman) takes a liking toJennifer Lopez and the two end up doing the dirty deed one night, which brings you to the main plot point of the film, which is Jennifer Lopez's vagina turns men into sadistic murderers and stalkers, hell bent on a second taste. Literally, that is the point of the film that gets you from point A to point B. Nothing in the movie makes one lick of sense, nor does the dialogue.Noah just can't seem to bring himself to accept that it won't work out with Claire in the film, so instead of focusing his efforts on someone his age, he kills and tortures people along with stalking the one he is so in love with to get his jollies off. It's actually pretty funny when you look at it that way. Out of all the stalker situations, murders, and attempted murders in the movie, nobody calls the authorities, when it's blatant and obvious that Noah is causing all of this chaos. Hell he doesn't even hide it in public either.There were tons of plot holes and set ups and characters that never showed up again or wrapped up in anyway shape or form, nor did the one big sex scene between Lopez and Guzman look like any real steamy sensual love making episode. It was all amateur hour here. And my god, the acting. Ten times worse than daytime soap operas. It's so bad in fact, you can play a drinking game in which you could take a drink each time someone delivers a cheesy line or has a case of the shitty acting virus, and you'd be drunk within six minutes. Just look at the trailer below.I will say that in the final two minutes of the film, before the movie abruptly ends (thank God), we got to see a B-Movie eye gouge sequence, which made me laugh out loud. But other than that cheap practical effect, 'The Boy Next Door' crashed into the mountain at top speed early on. But at least this gives a new meaning to ""Taco Flavored Kisses"".",The Boy Next Door

56,ArchonCinemaReviews,Name a reason a movie is bad and The Boy Next Door has it,2,24 February 2015,"The Boy Next Door is one of those horrid films that one mustn't ever watch, or else risk damaging one's soul.There are some films that never see the light of day, unfortunately The Boy Next Door was not one of those films, but boy, it should have been! Jennifer Lopez plays a mother and wife named Claire whose husband has a tenacity for secretaries. With her marriage on the rocks, her best friend and co-worker Vicky (Kristin Chenoweth) implores her to explore the single life. Vicky didn't mean sleeping with the hot twenty year old named Noah (Ryan Guzman) that moves next door, and things get complicated when he shows up at her work place – the local high school. Even more problematic is he is a burgeoning psychopath.The Boy Next Door has all the makings of a cheap knock off made for television or straight to VHS. You know it is going to be a train-wreck when screenwriter Barbara Curry lays out the most nonsensical first five minutes of a film to set up the entirety of the 'thrills'. Curry's unoriginality is marvelously overwhelming with one ridiculous cliché after another (cheating husband, troubled marriage, loner kid, orphaned/troubled hottieseriously, name one and it's here). Apparently mood building and suspense is not in her forte as emotions and events jump erratically to debilitating ludicrosity.The Boy Next Door has the intent to be a Fatal Attraction for the females but without interesting characters or plausible plot it is just junk-cinema and fails superbly. The film is so horrid it is difficult to tell who is most responsible, writer, editor or actors, for all involved with this project are truly terrible.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",The Boy Next Door

58,monstermayhem32,A nice thriller but cheesy in certain parts,6,8 February 2015,"When I saw the film, it reminded me of a modern day fatal attraction but this time the role reversal was the crazy boy stalker and the women being the victim. Jennifer Lopez gives a decent performance as Claire Peterson who is trying to move forward with her love life after her husband Garrett played by John Corbett cheated on her with his secretary. Claire seems quite lonely in her life despite her son Kevin being around, she longs for romance. After a disastrous blind date arranged by her co either Vicky posted by Kristin chenowith, Claire meets Noah played by Ryan guzman who becomes friends with her son. After a night together, Claire discovers a much more sinister and dark side behind the kind facade Noah has and becomes obsessed with her. I will say while certain moments are cringeworthy particularly the dialogue but the film has a fast pace and a decent ending.",The Boy Next Door
59,squirrel_burst,They're still making movies this bad?! I thought this was the future!,1,16 February 2015,"It's 2015 and I can't believe it; they're still making movies this bad. ""The Boy Next Door"" is like a cross between the worst Hot Milf porno you've ever seen, and the dumbest thriller ever. Jennifer Lopez plays Claire, the mother of a 17-year-old son (Ian Nelson as Kevin) who is going through a divorce. Enter the titular boy next door, Ryan Guzman as Noah. They have a one-night stand, and Noah turns out to be a crazy person that begins stalking her, jeopardizing her job as a teacher, her family and... her life! Have you ever seen ""Single White Female""(1992), ""Fear"" (1996), ""Swimfan"" (2002) or ""The Roommate"" (2011),? If you've seen ANY of those, you've already seen this movie. What I'm trying to say is that if you're having a bad day and you feel like you're kind of dumb, you watch this film and you will feel like a superhero who can tell the future because this is some of the most predictable garbage I've ever seen in the theater. This is a movie whose plot would have been finished in 10 minutes if anyone in it was half as intelligent as the audience watching. And yes, I am considering that you have to be some kind of dummy to even consider watching what looked like a bad movie from the trailer.I almost want to call this film a science fiction story because none of the people in it behave like human beings and the police do not exist in this world. Let me give you an example. Let's say for I was a high-profile businessman and I was having a steamy affair with my secretary. I tell her it's over because I'm getting back together with Jennifer Lopez (hey, it's my fantasy) and she begins blackmailing me by showing me that she has a video of us on her desk at midnight. This is 2015. Hidden camera footage isn't just a VHS tape lying around her place anymore, it's a digital file that could be anywhere on the web, even on a secure server that only she could access. I know that going to her laptop, finding the file and dragging it to the trash bin really wouldn't do anything so what I would do, is call the police and tell them I'm being blackmailed by a crazy lady who probably has a shrine to me in her basement. Or, I buy myself one of those mini recorders, go up to her and engage her in a conversation so I can prove that she's crazy and blackmail her right back. I just came up with that right here and now, but don't those seem like logical ways to think? You will find nothing of the sort in this movie.I can handle a bad movie just fine. I can get over characters being so short-sighted that they make constant mistakes, or side characters being completely unable to put two and two together when someone tries to murder them, even people giving vicious beatings to each other without anyone getting arrested for unexplained reasons. What I really take offense to is being swindled out of what I want to see in a bad movie. This is an erotic thriller with Jennifer Lopez, it's rated R and there's a prolonged sex scene between her and Ryan Guzman... and you don't see any of her fun bits. I should have started the review with that and it would have let you know right away what a ripoff this film is. You want to know what you see in this ""sexy stalker"" movie? A couple of butt shots of Ryan Guzman and some random girl naked. The movie even chickens out by making the guy she's involved with 20 instead of underage, meaning if you haven't seen any of the films this one is ripping off and you are a dumb teenager trying to put yourself in the shoes of a psycho so you can get together with J-Lo, you have to ignore that the guy you're trying to mentally replace with yourself is 27 years old. I take further offense at the fact that during any scene in which Claire or Noah is flashing back to the one night of passion we only get the same footage played back to us, no new clips or anything. Yeah it was a prolonged, pretty steamy sequence, but once again, what part of Rated R did no one understand when they were making this picture? I have to give this film credit for two things, which means it earns itself a lonely half star out of five. The first is that if you end up seeing it, you have probably viewed one of the worst movies of 2015 and witnessing something this bad, this early in the year might jolt you onto a path of better movie watching. The second is that I saw this film while attending a film festival of classic sci-fi and action films. I basically had the choice between seeing ""Hellboy"" a second time in two days or ""The Boy Next Door"". I went with this movie because I was feeling kind of burnt out between all of the good films I had seen and all of the crazy concepts I had to wrap my mind around. It's like when you're shopping for cologne, you have to cleanse your nose pallet by sniffing something totally different, otherwise the smells become overwhelming. Thank you ""Boy Next Door"". Your unstoppably unimaginative, awfully written plot was just the pallet cleanser I needed to enjoy ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with a fresh pair of eyes.Don't even consider watching this film, even as a movie that's ""So Bad it's Good"". ""The Boy Next Door"" is plain awful. It doesn't even deliver the campy thrills or sleazy exploitation I was hoping a movie this bad would.

61,trublu215,One of the worst films I've ever seen,1,22 January 2015,"The Boy Next Door is the latest film that January of 2015 has to offer and man oh man does this film scream January. It doesn't just scream January, it screams out multiple other adjectives to describe this useless, idiotic, and ridiculous film. The Boy Next Door pits a recent divorceè in a torrid affair with the next door neighbor who happens to be crazy and you could probably tell how this film is going to go due to its overtly ""let's not even try anymore"" attitude. Let's start off with the good...there is none. Now for the bad, there's a ton. Number one, I think that anyone with half a brain could probably realize that this is a horrible film. It is paced terribly, it has the dialog of a cheesy Lifetime movie from the nineties and it has Jennifer Lopez in her worst role to date. The film's 90 or so minute runtime even feels too long as we wallow in classic stalker movie clichés for its duration. It runs through the classic genre thrills from Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and many more and uses absolutely nothing with it. The biggest issue with this film isn't the terrible plot, it isn't the half baked thrills, it is the dialog. The dialog in this film sounds like the first draft of an episode of Guiding Light. There's no flavor to it, thus letting the actors turn in bland and listless performances. For a film that is listed as a suspense thriller, there is no suspense and zero thrills. Quite honestly, the only thing that was thrilling in this film were the end credits. Yes, this film is that bad and it stands up pretty high on the list of terrible films I've seen. It fits nice and snug between Troll 2 and Gigli.",The Boy Next Door
62,FallenEye,The Mother Next Door,5,10 July 2016,"This movie could've been a whole lot more enjoyable than it turned out to be.I don't know if I should give it a 4 or a 5.Negatives:Badly edited. Ryan Guzman is, again, not too great an actor. Movie is incredibly predictable. Ian Nelson's character constantly keeps swaying at a drop of a hat. Movie provides no closure. Non whatsoever.Positives:Jennifer Lopez is still as gorgeous as ever. Movie somehow managed to avoid a shower scene. Not too bad a job, off a 4 Million Dollar budget.Conclusion: 4.9/10. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but, I personally enjoy Jennifer Lopez's performances for what they are, and honestly, given the budget, perhaps this movie could've also been worse. Also, if Noah wasn't the crazy boy he was before he moved in next door, I'd certainly understand if he suddenly became one, after that rainy, and stormy night.",The Boy Next Door

66,CleveMan66,"""The Boy Next Door"" isn't groundbreaking, but is very well done.",8,24 January 2015,"Some guys have all the luck. Take Ryan Guzman for example. He was born with the too-handsome-for-his-own-good-and-too-buff-for-anybody-else's-good gene (and, yes, that's a thing), he's got charm and chops, AND he gets to pretend to make love to Jennifer Lopez on screen. That's one lucky guy! And I was lucky enough to see his and her latest film, ""The Boy Next Door"" (R, 1:31).Lopez plays Claire Peterson, a high school literature teacher with a cheating husband (John Corbett) and a sweet, bullied teenage son named Kevin (Ian Nelson) who has severe medical issues. Guzman is Noah, the titular boy who moves in next door. Well, he's not really a boy. He's nearly 20. He moved in with his great uncle because of the old man's health issues and to finish high school after he missed too much class due to the untimely death of his parents. So, Noah is taking care of a sick relative, trying to finish his education, using his talent for fixing things to help his neighbors and befriending Kevin, a kid in desperate need of a buddy. What's not to like? It's no surprise when Claire, still reeling from her husband's adultery and fresh off a bad blind date, sees Noah as just a hunk, a hunk of Burning Love (apologies to Elvis). Claire tries to resist Noah's advances, but he won't take ""no"" for an answer – when he comes on to her, or when he insists on continuing the affair. He gradually becomes more and more demanding and more and more assertive in trying to get what he wants. With Noah being her son's only friend, with thoughts of reconciling with her husband running through her head and with the knowledge that she slept with a student at the school where she teaches (an increasingly volatile student), Claire has quite a problem on her hands. After her protestations repeatedly fall on Noah's seemingly deaf ears, and worried about what he'll do next, Claire is forced to confide in her friend Vicky (Kristen Chenoweth), who also happens to be the school's assistant principal. And that's when the ""fun"" REALLY begins.""The Boy Next Door"" is a throwback to the bad guy movies of the 1980s and the erotic thrillers of the 90s, but that's okay by me. This movie feels fresh. The smart script and solid performances make the situations seem uncomfortably real and we're eventually surprised to find out that Noah has more than one motivation for his actions. Along the way, there's even a moment or two that made me jump in my seat (yeah, they got me). The ending, while not entirely unpredictable, is staged with a very effective feeling of suspense. Placed between an especially well done movie poster and music that made me want to sit through the closing credits, I guess you could say that I liked this movie from beginning to end. Although the story isn't really all that original and I feel that it did a disservice to female abuse victims by showing a woman saying ""no"", then giving in and then blaming herself, those objections are fairly minor compared to the overall quality of this well-executed thriller. Arriving in theaters very early in the year, I'll still say this is my favorite 2015 release so far. ""A-""",The Boy Next Door

68,stephendaxter,"Just another trainwreck to add to the forever growing ""Disasters of January"" list",2,7 February 2015,"The Boy Next Door was one of the messiest (and at times just plain stupid) films that i have seen recently. The more this film progressed the more i had to question what type of film this was. The plot took it from a drama and a chick flick, to an attempt at a mystery thriller, and then when all else failed just transformed into your average cliché horror slasher; and not one of those genres did it do well. The movie felt like the studio just gave up and put out an early edit of the film as on a few occasions the film cut from one day to the next and even from one hour to the next and manages to confuse you so much that you don't even know how much time has past until you think about it a little, and even then you still aren't sure. And then you talk about the performances, no-one in this movie even tried to put in a good performance, all of the actions and reactions by the characters felt exaggerated and so fake that it took you out of the film. Not the worst performances i've seen but not at all convincing. This film took a few pages from the twilight series and had a few minutes all up of just staring, making the film seem another 15 minutes longer than it already was. Jennifer Lopez was not as bad as the entire supporting cast but was still playing a bland character. Acting talent aside, there were a few moments in the film where you could forget about the nonsense that was going on and watch a beautiful woman walk around in as little clothing that she could find. Something to enjoy while having to sit through an hour and a half of crap. This movie was a mess, riddled with bad acting, a terrible plot, predictable forced dialogue and one of the most rushed endings i've seen recently. - 2.6",The Boy Next Door
69,vip-danii,"Oh, puh-lease!",6,10 August 2015,"Yep, just as I thought -- yet another one of J.Lo's vanity projects.This movie cannot be taken seriously. It's too ritzy, too unrealistic, too clichéd, too predictable, and too lame. J.Lo is essentially portraying herself, much like in all of her other movies. A really boring, stale, one-dimensional character.This movie is just not realistic. There's so much that's wrong with it.Come on, the guy is too old for the role (they look about 5 years apart -- kudos to J.Lo's make-up artist, I guess).If you want to see a believable older woman / younger man story, watch ""Notes on a Scandal"" -- a very good one.This? An erotic thriller? There's nothing erotic about it, and it's hardly a thriller.Cringeworthy dialogue, amateurish acting, ridiculous storyline, stupid ending.In the end, the stalker dude is portrayed as some kind of invincible terminator or something -- with superhuman strength and abilities. It was so lame and ridiculous, you had to laugh.I gave this movie a (relatively) high rating (certainly much higher than it deserves), because I did, in fact, enjoy it, and so will you -- if you view it as a comedy. I cannot believe that these people are able to take themselves seriously. I'm sure no-one else does. You'd have to be pretty desperate to agree to star in a movie this bad, but, considering that they hired a bunch on no-names and has-beens, it's hardly surprising.Anyway, this has to be one of the dumbest movies I have seen in recent years.

70,rjsf96,A Farcical Thriller,1,5 January 2016,"When is a thriller not thrilling? When it's directed by Rob Cohen, written by Barbara Curry and starring Jennifer Lopez. Or when said film is called The Boy Next Door. Either criteria is a good fit.The dilemma? Jennifer Lopez plays an English literature teacher. If you're laughing now rest assured that this is entirely normal. I had to take time to compose myself and trite conveniences such as these which pop up all over the place in The Boy Next Door make the entire film laughably bad. She falls for the boy next door, which you all will have guessed as much. If you can put two and two together like any person can, then you will see every plot twist coming. What you won't be able to see coming though is ear scraping dialogue and clichés filled to the brim. The film is overflowing with them. As anticipated she starts an affair with the boy next door. Everything's perfect. That is until he starts stalking her, sending creepy photos and dribbling at her mere presence.I hate to admit it, but I've got to hand it to Hollywood. Only they can release films as bad as this and still make more than their budget back opening weekend. Films that take risks and are made with intellect and intelligence are shunned to the side and dismissed. I could make a list of every film ever made, compare it to this one and have the worst films of all time come out with glowing reviews. In fact The Boy Next Door makes films like White House Down and The Gunman, which are so called thrillers look like the next Casino Royale. I could spend the entirety of this review contrasting this film to others, just to drive the point home that this movie flat out sucks. But frankly it would be a waste of mine and your precious time, so I won't. As for me I'll just get back to what I love most; reviewing movies and dreck like this, so you don't have to. I don't need to tell you to steer clear though, you'll have guessed as much just from reading the synopsis. How do I know? Because you're intelligent and if you're like me you require films that challenge you physically and mentally. The Boy Next Door treats audiences as if they are a brain dead baby that's just come out of the womb. The only way you could enjoy this crime against cinema is if you had a lobotomy. I will be the first to say that I don't think that's a viable solution to the problem at hand.F",The Boy Next Door
71,CowherPowerForever,Brakes come extra on a Dodge,3,7 February 2015,"The Boy Next Door is a thriller simply meant to attract viewers with good looking people. This film is one giant cliché of the thriller genre, and frankly is one of the most boring theatrical experiences I have had in awhile. Outside of some good directing during the action scenes, this films has really nothing to offer. The following is my review of The Boy Next Door.The Boy Next Door was written by Barbara Curry, who gets her first Hollywood break on this film. The story is fairly simple. Claire Peterson(Jennifer Lopez) is a high school teacher, right before the school year starts a new student moves in next door. He will be going to the school Claire teaches at. Well, the back story here is that Claire is having marriage problems with her husband, and she is lonely. Without going into too much detailed here, she falls for the student next door and when she wants to break it off with him, he goes insane. Not really much I'm missing. The story is paper thin, as expected in a film like this. The film very slow and nothing really keeps your interest over the course of the film. I was just bored watching this film. Overall, Curry does a below average job on this script, but to be fair, most were not expecting much anyway.The film was directed by Rob Cohen. Cohen is well known for directing popular films such as The Fast and the Furious, XXX, and more recently he directed the Alex Cross film. For him to take a film on like this is not a big surprise as his career is not as big as it once was. He is also known for big action movies, and that doesn't happen much in this film. There are some bigger action scenes, but they are quick and there aren't many. The acting lead by actress Jennifer Lopez is another awful area. Lopez is not known to be a great actress, but you don't really buy what she is selling in her role. Cohen usually doesn't get great performances from his actors, but this was very bad in that aspect. While there aren't many action scenes, I must admit the ones in the film aren't badly shot. With Cohen's experience shooting those types of scenes, this is to be expected. So I will give the film at least some credit. Rob Cohen offers up another bust in his recent string of bad film, but one has to wonder why take a film on like that knowing it wasn't going to be good.Nathan Barr and Randy Edelman are the composers of this film. Barr is known for scoring films like Grindhouse and Hostel, while Edelman is known for scoring films like XXX and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor(both directed by Rob Cohen). The overall score is depth less. The bigger areas of the score hit towards the end of the film when the action picks up. For a thriller a score is very important and can make a film better. I never felt anything from this score. It adds nothing, and in the end was a complete waste of some good talent.In closing, we are left with a lifeless thriller of a film. There are some good aspects to the film, but nothing that saves it from the mess that it is. Most going into this film probably knew it was going to be a low budget film and not very good. Outside of looking at Jennifer Lopez for about a hour and a half, there is no reason to spend any money on this film.3/10",The Boy Next Door
72,Eric_Cubed,Awful but watchable,4,8 June 2015,"Man, there are too many haters out there. J-Lo is a pretty good actress, and the sex scenes in this one are probably the best I've ever seen (e.g. I hit pause and was spanking it to porn the first 3 seconds in). It's amazing how expectations and the power of suggestion work. I went into the new Mad Max with extremely high expectation and thought it was the most ridiculous and over the top move ever (though it's really awesome). On the opposite front, I went into this one with the lowest of the low expectations, mostly due to the poor rating on rotten tomatoes. Crazily enough, I ended up enjoying this film, as I did ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" and ""Fatal Attraction."" The antagonist is a Vince Vaughn Normal Bates with fine acting skills and model good looks. I hate him for that, but that is for another essay. That said, this movie is nothing special, but it is watchable, as in that other J-Lo film ""Enough"" was watchable. I would suggest having multiple media playing as you barely glance at this movie at it progresses, such as this review I am writing now, Facebook Backgammon and the window of my apartment.",The Boy Next Door

Her neighbor lover Noah, played by Ryan Guzman, had just moved in next door and he could not take his eyes off of Claire. Noah used his charm and looks to take advantage of Claire when she was vulnerable. But quickly after the two had sex, Noah was the one that went obsessive crazy over Claire.His obsession had him do some irrational things, but it was not anything to extreme. He recorded the two of them without her knowing. He printed numerous copies of photos of the two of them naked and decorated Claire's class room with them. Noah would also stalk her. He manipulated her son to trust him over her.He even kills one of Claire's friends and kidnaps her husband and son.This really could have been much more suspenseful than what it was.

Few mistakes, silly moments in the middle after that however, the conflict remaining brutal and the antagonist not letting it any easy for the protagonist.

78,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,Hot for a Teacher!,4,2 September 2016,"Rob Cohen's The Boy Next Door is an absolute terrifying, jaw dropping, and will have you screaming, but not in a good way. This big budget blockbuster feels like a throwback to daytime made for TV movies. But, I have actually seen daytime made for television movies that are better than this. This movie is so bad, and I mean BAD. Some parts I did enjoy, the other parts of the film are poorly written, poorly acted, and cheesy. Even though I do not think that was the director's intention. The Boy Next Door has its share of so-bad-they're-good moments. Mostly, they are just bad. Jennifer Lopez (Money Train, Jack) stars as Claire Peterson, a beautiful San Fernando Valley high school teacher who has recently separated from her cheating husband Garrett, played by John Corbett (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Sex and the City 2). Though you would not know it from the flawless makeup and runway-ready wardrobe she wears while grading papers in her mini mansion, Claire is feeling lost and lonely, and struggling to raise her teenage son, Kevin, played by Ian Nelson (The Hunger Games, The Best of Me), alone.One day, some young, bulging biceps, handsome help arrives, his name is Noah, played by Ryan Guzman (Step Up: Revolution, Everybody Wants Some). A 19-year-old San Bernardino transplant, Noah has just moved in next door to help care for his old uncle and in spite of some vague references to an ""accident"" in his past, he manages to effortlessly wedge himself into Claire's life. Fixing her car and garage door, showing up for dinner, and helping Kevin gain the confidence to talk to the popular neighborhood pretty girl. In addition to his expertise with auto repair, he is also a skilled computer hacker, a violent kick boxer, and suffers from ""anger"" issues. HOT FOR A TEACHERWhen Kevin leaves for a weekend camping trip, Claire gets hot and heavy with the titular next-door boy. After that night, Noah turns on a dime into an obsessive stalker, appearing unannounced at her home and somehow getting a seat in her high-school literature class. The boy next door may actually be a nightmare.""I LOVE YOUR MOTHER'S COOKIES""First off, let's talk about the cast. I believe that when Jennifer Lopez is given a good script and direction she can be a good actress. She can calm off as talented, and get by on more than just her looks. How many teachers look like Jennifer Lopez? Not many. We all know the kids in that class would not be learning a damn thing. The movie treats her as if she is just an ordinary plain Jane teacher, and I was sitting back saying, really? Especially a class filled with hormone-crazed teenagers.Also, in the film Noah looks like a 30 something year old man in high school. Jennifer Lopez's son is only a year younger than Noah is. Noah already acts like his daddy, looks easily 10 years older than he does, and literally like a grown man in a class. Think of Robin Williams in the movie Jack. In addition, the way the character is written is not very scary. For instance, he spends have the movie looking at her through a window, and driving behind her in traffic. Overall, he is never truly menacing, which depletes this erotic thriller of much of its thrills. Jennifer Lopez's husband is one dumb dude! Noah is clearly flirting and intimately touching his wife. All Mr. Peterson can do is eat cookies, sit on the couch, and say he seems like a nice kid. Accordingly, the film is poorly written. Everything from what the characters do, to the decisions they make, the plot, the ending, the dialogue, and tone. These characters make some mind bottling decisions. Also, the ending you can clearly see coming a mile away. I read on IMDb that this film was shot in 25 days. I am starting to think maybe they had to rush the writing. If they did, it clearly shows. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thought on the film The Boy Next Door. If you are looking for a bad movie night maybe, you can check this out. It is poorly acted, poorly written, silly, and honestly just a bad movie. The film takes itself way to seriously. It is the kind of film where instead of focusing on making a great film, they focus on how great everyone looks, especially J-Lo. I did enjoy climactic showdown, in a burning barn, of all places. But my biggest issue with this film was the writing and acting. I believe The Boy Next Door earns a4/10This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

79,keithlovesmovies,The Boy Next Door Review,3,23 September 2015,"When handsome teenager Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman) moves in next door to take care of his ailing uncle, separated high-school teacher from her husband Garrett (John Corbett), Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) and him begin a friendship and occasionally engage in what she thinks is harmless flirtation. Despite the fact that Noah spends a lot of time with Claire's son Kevin (Ian Nelson), Noah's attraction to her becomes more and more palpable. One evening, Claire decides to give in to Noah's attempts of seduction and when she tries to end their relationship, he suddenly becomes obsessive and violent.When I thought there was never going to be a film worse than Fantastic Four, here comes The Boy Next Door. I knew its reputation but I wanted to see it for myself. The film definitely has a few things going for it though. The story is bad. The acting is bad. The dialogue is bad. It makes Fantastic Four look like a masterpiece in comparison. The story is not an original one that is full of cheese and stalker-movie clichés and it also gets silly at times from all the implausible things that happen. The most implausible thing has to be how quickly Noah became obsessed with Claire as they barely spent any time together at the beginning so you never really believe him. It is also riddled with plot holes that the film seems to not care about trying to solve. The characters often alternate between annoying and stupid gullible. I know they must advance the plot but at times I found myself yelling at the screen when characters said or did stupid things which was quite often. The acting was rather inconsistent with some being over-the-top like Ryan Guzman as Noah and some being bland like everyone else. The only performance I liked was Kristen Chenoweth as Claire's best friend Vicky as she was able to provide some comic relief. The bad script could be to blame but good actors are supposed to overcome things like that. I haven't laughed so much at bad dialogue since I saw Fifty Shades of Gray. As with Fifty Shades of Gray, most of the bad dialogue occurs in the scenes between Noah and Claire as every time they would talk to each other, I couldn't help but to cringe. If I did have to pick one thing I liked about the film, it would be the end. The end is by far the silliest part of the film but I liked it because of something I don't want to spoil and because it was the end. This is a short film at around 90 minutes but when you're watching it, it could sometimes feel longer. If they could just have fixed the story and the script and after that made the film longer, it could have been better than it was.Score: 3/10 keithlovesmovies.com",The Boy Next Door
80,hthbrr2,The movie makes little sense,1,19 April 2015,"This movie could have been good, we have good talent in it, except the character motivations are just not there. That is why this movie is a joke. It is listed as a thriller. So it supposed to be scary, suspenseful, violent, but it fails since it all comes off as unintentional comedy.The reason it's so funny is because none of these characters are real. They just do things randomly to advance the plot. So you laugh at how silly it all is. The movie starts out with Jennifer Lopez's character Claire dealing with her unfaithful husband. It's never really made clear, is she divorced, separated? She still wears her ring, she talks about signing papers. Yet she tries to get back with him? What? She is devastated that he cheated on her and we get shown this time and time again. OK...So by those standards she should be over him. A younger man is interested in her, he is not underage so no problems there. Why does she push him away, they are both adults. She is interested in him. I mean if anyone saw a 40 year old man with a 20 something woman no one would bat an eyelash. So why it is taboo for women? Again her motivations make so sense. She hates her husband, but refuses a new man in her life? Even though she has started to date? What? This makes no sense. The only reason she went on a date was to build 'suspense'to try to get the audience to 'care' about these people. (They made the date a jerk to the nth degree. OK, more characters not making sense. If this Claire character is so strong in her beliefs then why is she friends with a woman that is her total opposite? That means she would be OK with this young guy who is also forceful like her school friend....since her school friend sets her up on dates with total jerks....)But since these characters are not real we don't care about them. We are not invested in them. We don't care if they live or die. Therefore when they are at risk of being hurt we just don't care. We just laugh at how silly what they are doing is because it makes no sense. If these were real people they would not be in these situations not by a long shot...anyways. If this Claire character really hated her hubby she would hit the dating scene, if this is true then she would have been OK with getting with Noah, the younger guy interested in her. Yet she rejects everything. Until the end so that the movie can be wrapped up quickly.That is the problem with modern cinema we make the characters do stuff that makes no sense to reach plot points. Instead of making characters that inwardly reach them. It's bad writing. There is 0 character development in this movie.Not only that is was shot horribly, sometimes they could not even clearly keep the actors in frame. So if you want to see how horrible the state of mainstream American media is watch this movie. It also serves as unintentional comedy like Twilight. Laugh at the cheesy cheesy lines. Not kidding this is what the stalker guy basically said after he slept with Claire in code in front of her family ""Yes it got very wet last night.....I love your mother's cookies."" LMAO!!!! CHEESE!!!!!",The Boy Next Door
81,DJ_Shilo,Don't visit The Boy Next Door,1,3 February 2020,"Here's a thriller in which a teenage hunk seduces a mum twice his age and then stalks and threatens here while made to be as over the top as possible. If you're going to make an R rated ripoff of ""Fatal Attraction,"" at least have the decency to make an ""erotic"" thriller and not a thriller, which gets marketed as ""erotic."" Director Rob Cohen holds every resistant possible, no doubt at studio demands, to sell this to teenagers. Add Jennifer Lopez, who, for sure, had a no-nudity clause in her contract, and you get ""The Boy Next Door."" A cheesy title to a film that is the prime example of a studio taking advantage of audiences in January, the month where movies go to die with little fanfare.It's about an English literature teacher, Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez), who separates from her husband, Garret (John Corbett) after she catches him cheating on her with a secretary. Not long after, she meets Noah (Ryan Guzman), who has just moved into the house next door with his uncle and Noah becomes drawn to Claire. While her son Kevin (Ian Nelson), goes away on a fishing trip with his dad, Claire ends up sleeping with Noah, despite her hesitation. A one night stand is not what Noah had in mind, and when Claire tells him she regrets what happened, he begins an attempt to tear her life apart.Certain aspects of the thriller genre blend well together from erotic to intensity, but this garbage proves that thrillers are dying. It's even sadder when ""thrillers"" are reduced to everything within and surrounding the concept are either one-note or just plain stupid. This movie's most significant problems lie within the writing and the acting. It opens with Claire being sad for herself because her husband gets caught cheating with another woman. She lives in the San Fernando Valley, serving as a single parent to her teenage son, Kevin. At night Claire wears tank tops, and Jennifer Lopez, 45, is a force of nature to behold. She goes out on a miserable double date with her best friend, Vicky (Kristen Chenoweth), and when she comes home, Noah catches her watching him change clothes through her window.With her son away, Claire, after drinking a few glasses of wine, gives into Noah's flirtations, and she sleeps with him. The next morning, Claire regrets her actions and begins to worry who will find out, and when she rejects Noah, he becomes a clingy, volatile, control freak, and when he punches a hole in a wall in a fit of rage that should be Claire's first clue that there is something wrong with this guy. He acts like a child as he stalks her, and he is never really that menacing. We get the hint that the reason he is an orphan and living with his uncle is his fault somehow, and it is. The explanation is stupid as hell. Noah goes about elaborately threatening to expose Claire sleeping with him. Instead of going to the Police, we would have no movie; she plays cat and mouse game with him as she stumbles about trying to run from him, placing herself in further danger.Noah does not come off as a believable villain due to his pretty-boy looks. The first time we see him, it is his muscular pipes seen before we see his face. You can never really believe that a 19-year-old kid would go to this much trouble to destroy someone's life and have the efficiency to do it. He even goes as far as to manipulate Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. He also beats up a bully at school who is bothering Kevin, causing him to become violent. Noah starts to lose it when he sees Claire and Garret, together after a date, and this elevates his obsession with her.From here, there are multiple instances of elaborately threatening behaviour. Noah continues to stalk Claire to the point of lunacy, and it even goes as far as to add an attempted rape scene that is right out of place. The kid is not menacing, nor does he come off as a rapist. There is also a useless subplot involving a sex tape that is used as blackmail for stupidity if she does not do something. Of course, she refuses, and this makes him crazier. With the help of a detective, she learns the truth behind why Noah is living with his uncle and what has made him go berserk, and it's a pathetic excuse. Its climactic showdown in a burning barn of all places gets graphically violent, and it is insane with hammers, crowbars and an Epipen, that you'll wish you had a walked out in the first act.",The Boy Next Door
82,jsaus63304,You have seen it before-only done a lot better,3,6 June 2016,"Totally a formula movie. We have seen the plot a dozen times with a mentally deranged person who is obsessed with another person, works their way into the life of that person and becomes dangerously deranged. Similar plot to films like Fatal Attraction, The Babysitter, The Stepfather and dozens of other films on the Lifetime Network. What really amazes me is that well known stars will actually accept rolls in films like this. Do they need the money that badly? Maybe with American Idol ending, Jennifer Lopez felt she would need a little cash to hold her over to the next gig. Bad acting, bad writing, bad character development, bad plot.

While more reminiscent of an old TV Movie-Of- The-Week than a Hollywood release, it was pretty intense thanks to decent acting by both Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman. The supporting cast was also good, especially John Corbett. Solid acting all around, honestly--didn't expect that level of acting in something I thought would be a simple 2 hour escape from reality. What impressed me most when I saw her on-screen was Jennifer Lopez. At this writing, she's 45 years old and she is well on her way to being the next Sophia Loren as far as ""hot older women"" goes. The last time I saw Jennifer Lopez in a movie was in ""Anaconda"" and I thought she was very good in that role--which was 18 years ago. She looks better today than she did then and her acting has improved. Never heard her sing a single song, never seen her in concert, never seen her in other films, but she's just won a fan. You could do a lot worse than ""The Boy Next Door.""",The Boy Next Door

The film accepts that there will be problems in marriages, and it calls for those involved to patch things up with their spouse for the good of the institution.The acting is middling and the plot is predictable.

85,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,The Boy Next Door Review,2,23 January 2015,"My Thoughts:Where to begin with The Boy Next Door. If you are going into this expecting anything different then your standard obsession movie you will be disappointed. The only thing this movie tries to do differently is that instead of having it be a female obsessed over a man they switch it up. For the ladies you will be more than happy with Ryan Guzman on this he is there for eye candy and you definitely get your monies worth out of him. Guys you will be slightly disappointed. Yes we get some hot and steamy scenes from Jennifer Lopez but we really do not see anything we haven't seen in any of her music videos or other commercials. And to tell you the truth since we have a lot of cut scenes I would not be surprised to learn that some of those scenes were a J-Lo body double.But back to the movie at hand. It is a by the number obsession movie. You get a boy that moves next door to a separated mother of one. Boy becomes close to the family and one thing leads to another and boy and mother hook up. Boy believes there is something more between them, mother believes it was a one night mistake. And then comes the crazy.They did skirt the issue of an older woman sleeping with an underage kid by having Noah (Ryan Guzman) be a 19 year old kid who had a few setbacks and have to finish his senior year of school. But even with that there tons of holes in this movie if you sit down and think about it for just a minute. If I posted them I would give away a lot of the movie for those that are still planning to see this movie. This is a movie that is asking you to shut off your brain and not really think to hard on this movie and the plot.This movies pace is very quick as well, meaning that things happen very quickly and doesn't really give you a chance to get everything together by the time they are done with one scene they throw the next situation out at you and wonder why they reacted so fast when they just got done with the previous scene.This is what I categorize as a true January movie. The studios wanted to make it but know that it isn't that great of a movie so they place it in January where usually there is not a lot of great movies out there during this time.

Jennifer better hang onto those good looks, it's about all she brought to the screen in this head-straight-to-Lifetime cheesy, totally predictable thriller.The only performance even remotely interesting is turned in by Kristin Chenoweth, but her character (Jennifer's friend and work associate) makes a hasty exit. Am I the only person who thinks Kristin looks like Cameron Diaz? During the movie I busied myself pondering this because there was very little else to ponder.

90,Zebb67,Terrible Even By Lifetime Standards,1,7 July 2015,"I can add another movie to my ""worst films ever"" list. I'm guessing the only reason this garbage earned $35 million at the box office is because some people (ok, guys) were hoping to finally see an aging, heavily made-up J-Lo nude. No cigar. Just a sex scene that is only slightly more explicit than what you can see on daytime soap operas. I watched it because I have a weakness for trashy thrillers as they're often entertaining in their own stupid way.

91,rolandjordaan2,The Boy Next Door - Spoiler Free Review,4,17 September 2018,"Noah Sandborn's life is going well, he just moved in with his uncle, he's gone back to high school to finish his final year, his teacher/neighbour (Jennifer Lopez) is creepily watching him undress through the upstairs bedroom...yes life is going well for this attractive, charismatic young man. Until on stormy night, tragedy strikes, something he could never have expected, something he could never have foreseen...he under cooks his chicken, luckily Jennifer Lopez goes over to save the day and he thanks her by sleeping with her, so life is good again. The next morning though, his life is shattered once more when J-Lo calls their night of passion a mistake that should never have happened, Noah, obviously, doesn't take this rejection too well, so starts stalking her and trying to murder her family...perhaps a little over dramatic on his part, but then again, this is the risk J-Lo took when she slept with one of her students; he still might be the real victim here.
'The Boy Next Door' is your absolute standard stalker film, starting with one night of passion that obviously means more to one than the other, sending that person over the deep end and making him accomplish feats that makes you just want to employ him for his amazing time management. Jennifer Lopez does her best homage to her portrayal in 'Anaconda' bringing to screen the same amount of likeability and sympathy we felt for that character; I'm glad that she's at least kept her acting consistent for 18 years. Ryan Guzman does bring some creepiness to his portrayal of Noah Sandborn, but at times is just too over the top to really be taken seriously. He handles his transition from nice guy to psycho pretty well, but, as is usually the case with these movies, the writers kinda screw him in that department, making the transition instant, instead of just taking some time to show a rapid decline into madness, as is usually how it works in real life. His actions are exciting at times, and although predictable, isn't completely insufferable to watch, which basically sums up the movie as a whole as well: it really isn't any better or worse than the other films that followed this exact formula, so if you're a fan of 'Swimfan', 'The Roommate', 'Single White Female 2' and the 100s of other identical films, you'll probably enjoy this just fine.",The Boy Next Door

The type of movie you grab some popcorn and don't think too hard about. Jennifer Lopez is not a great actress but she is easy on the eye and the film exploits that repeatedly. It has some exciting moments and Ryan Guzman is very menacing in a number of scenes. The ending is a bit unrealistic and some of the dialog cheesy.

96,trvlers-77920,3.8/10,3,8 May 2015,"The cheese is thick and it smothers everything in ""The Boy Next Door,"" but it's never quite gooey or spicy enough. You want an erotic thriller in which a hunky 19-year-old seduces a mom twice his age – and then obsessively stalks and threatens her – to be as over-the-top as possible. If you're going to make an R-rated version of what is essentially Lifetime movie material, as director Rob Cohen has done here, you don't want anything resembling restraint. ""The Boy Next Door"" has its share of so-bad-they're-good moments – and details, and chunks of dialog – but not nearly enough. Mostly, they're just bad. And it had such potential too, starting with the casting. Jennifer Lopez stars as the WASPily named Claire Peterson, the hottest high school English teacher in the San Fernando Valley. How she finds time to blow out her hair and apply full makeup every morning – complete with smoky eyes and glossy lips – while also serving as a single parent to her teenage son, Kevin (Ian Nelson), is the film's real mystery. At night, she lounges around in flimsy tank tops and teddies that cling to the actress' world-famous posterior. Buffed and polished to a high sheen, J-Lo is 45 and has never looked better – and that's actually part of the problem. A woman who's a little more vulnerable, and a little less of a force of nature, might have been a more believable mark. Claire has been lonely lately since separating from her philandering husband, Garrett (John Corbett). And the sweet but slightly nerdy Kevin could use a strong male figure around, too. So it's perfect timing when the handsome and muscular Noah (Ryan Guzman) moves into the house next door to help his ailing uncle (who distractingly resembles Johnny Knoxville in his ""Bad Grandpa"" makeup). We actually see his biceps before we see his face. But there's so much more to him than just his looks; in the screenplay from first-timer Barbara Curry, he's hilariously too good to be true. Noah fixes cars and cleans out storm drains. (The first thing he repairs is Claire's broken garage door. How's that for a sexual metaphor?) He can beat up the bullies who antagonize Kevin and give the kid enough confidence to ask out the prettiest girl in school. But he's also a scholar, and can quote extensively from ""The Iliad."" (The way this classic piece of literature is used throughout the film inspired unintentional laughter during the screening I attended.) And so, at age 19, he finagles his way into Claire's English class, having never graduated from high school because of his troubled, orphaned past. On the one night a year that it rains in Los Angeles, after a couple glasses of wine, Claire gives in to Noah's flirtations and sleeps with him in a scene that's admittedly quite steamy, despite Lopez's no-nudity clause. The next morning, though, as she's gathering her things and preparing to do the (quick) walk of shame, Noah's clingy, intense freak-out should be her first clue that something is a little off with this guy. Guzman, a veteran of the ""Step Up"" franchise, may know the moves here, too, but never sells them convincingly. There's something too boyish about his looks and underdeveloped about his craft. He's never truly menacing, which depletes this erotic thriller of much of its thrills, and he ends up being thoroughly outmatched by the charismatic Lopez at every turn. From here, there are multiple instances of elaborately threatening behavior which should be enough cause for Claire to go to the police, but then we would have no movie. Instead, we watch as she scrambles and fumbles in hopes of appeasing this psycho – and inadvertently places herself and her family in further danger. Cohen directed the first ""Fast and Furious"" movie from 2001, and he gets the chance to insert one decent car chase as a reminder of what he's capable of doing with more lively material. Only the insane (and insanely violent) climactic showdown, in a burning barn, of all places, finally gives the people what they want. You'll howl, you'll squirm, you'll applaud with disgusted glee – and you'll wish that the rest of the film were that much fun.",The Boy Next Door

101,Callum_Hofler,One of the greatest movies ever made,1,22 March 2015,"Here's a test to see if The Boy Next Door will offend you with its blatant sexism, idiocy and technical ineptitude!1. Are you a human?If you answered yes to the prior question, you will be thoroughly offended by what I have just witnessed!In all seriousness... oh my god.I didn't know it was possible.I didn't realise I could love something as much as this.I've found it.Ladies and gentleman, I have found the next cult classic. The Boy Next Door is a transcendent level of bad that should be watched and loved by all!Such sh*t-tastic lines, including:*""I love your mother's cookies!"" *""Let me love you, Claire!"" *""Go f*ck yourself."" ""I'd rather f*ck you.""J-Lo, unwilling to go full-on nude, awkwardly clutching blankets to her body after engaging in a soft-core romp with one of the worst actors of our generation. Beautiful!After someone mentioned ""A clean slate"", I couldn't stop thinking about one of the Badman College Humor skits. I was laughing for far longer than was justified.This film is initially both a feminist's worst nightmare and ideal dream, rolled into one: the woman is weak-willed and falls prey to a guy, but it's also a terrible, demonizing, pathological and abusive guy, so that's points to the Tumblr feminists to use against us evil men! But then it's men who save the day at the end, so it kind of balances itself out, I think...The sound equalization gave me cancer. That is all.If you're not part of the scoring community, you won't understand the fuss made out of the film's score's release. Varese Sarabande released the album, but in their description, they somehow call it a ""historic"" collaboration between composers Randy Edelman and Nathan Barr. First and foremost, if you've read my review for this hunk of sh*t of a score on my website, you'll know that this is really inaccurate. Second: now you're in on the joke! Feel included!Character archetypes and unnecessary subplots! How fun!The shaky-cam is really stupid. It doesn't add intensity, nor is it particularly well-handled (study any Paul Greengrass film to see how it's done).So... many... unnecessary... insert shots...I'm sorry. But this movie is amazing. It's hilarious. Every second of it was fun. I was legitimately in a state of ecstasy the entire time.If you have not seen this movie, watch it. Now! It's worth every second, if only to watch Step-Up dancer #324 overact every little detail to the best of his ability!Note: I was tempted to give this film a perfect rating. In a way, it kind of deserves it. I am also very tempted to put this on my ""Favourites"" list, because it's so much fun. Absolutely recommended.",The Boy Next Door
102,jladimayuga,Love JLO but it's another story for Claire,4,4 April 2021,"I hate characters who make stupidest decisions. The danger is not going to be lesser just because the characters think smart; the thrill would still be there. In this film, it's as if they are too scared to make Claire think so they made her make the most illogical actions.1. You have a hunch that the person is a killer but you wouldnt tell the cop who you are speaking with. Instead you would run and tell your friend????? WHAT WOULD CAN THE FRIEND DO? WHAT WAS THE POINT?2. The fight scenes - i cant anymore. This is so frustrating. I love JLO but this movie is too badly written. Im sorry.",The Boy Next Door
103,dsmgdesign-34381,Glad I rented it from Red Box,2,28 November 2015,"When I picked this movie up from Red Box, I thought it might be a charming throw-back to movies like Fatal attraction and the Hand that rocks the cradle. The movie seems to start out that way. It had the right setting, the right pace. but it never lived up to its potential. Instead, this Jennifer Lopez vehicle was formulaic at best, and b-movie drivel at worse. It was mindless, void of any thrill, and out of touch with its target audience. Jennifer Lopez's half-hearted performance made me wonder why she is still pursuing acting as a career choice. She is much more interesting as a judge on American Idol. Ryan Guzman's performance on the other hand bordered mediocrity, but acceptable enough to help move the story along (Oh, in case you are wondering, I used the word ""story"" a bit too loosely, I'm afraid). Guzman at least gave his best attempt to channel Terry o'Quinn's frightening sociopathic killer in The Step Father. But It, too, fell short. The worse part of the film is what is typically the climatic ending. The best part of the film was J-lo and Guzman's love- making scene early in the film. Just don't pay full streaming price for this film. If you decide to rent it, at least make it to that scene. Then find Basic instinct and watch it again.",The Boy Next Door

105,cuthbertjoel,Another January Bomb,1,19 February 2015,"I think it's fair to say that you don't expect much when a film is released in January and stars Jennifer Lopez. And 'not much' is a polite way of expressing what I got.The generic title of the film is very apt given it rolls out every cliché in the book with the whole jealous stalker genre. The acting is atrocious, and because of this, the movie doesn't pull off any of the scenes that are supposed to be scary or thrilling or even remotely interesting. The film is so poorly scripted and directed that Oscar winning actors couldn't carry it. Let alone a singer and a guy whose acting credentials come out of the 'Step Up' sequels.Most of your time in the movie is spent laughing at how bad and unbelievable the film is or (for the guys) disappointed at how little of JLo you see in the sex scene.Just crap.

Cannot complain about the acting and the plot of this movie is quite interesting and can give an interesting thriller. I would not call this movie an ""erotic thriller"" because of tho lame sex-scenes. What I didn't like about that movie is that all story is too predictable. There is absolutely no surprise-effect in this movie. The end of that movie is too straight forward that you actually wait for something to happen to interrupt the ""Happy-End"" and are kind of disappointed that nothing like that happened. Sure, the end-fight is heavy, but still some kind of ""easy-win"" for the family. I also think that the plot with the additional computer-files that she found, the writers could have done some more interesting story-development.",The Boy Next Door

This movie is a twisted version of ""The Graduate"" (1967), although not only has Mrs. Robinson become Mrs. Peterson, but in this movie it is the teacher being seduced. Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman) moves next door to Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez), a teacher of Classical English Literature at the high school Noah will be attending. Claire is on rocky terms with her husband as the two struggle to be civil for the sake of their son Kevin (Ian Nelson). Noah is orphaned, and has moved in to help his elderly uncle who is going for an operation and Noah intends to provide help as he recovers. Noah quickly befriends the Petersons, and one night, while home alone, he calls upon Mrs. Peterson to come to his rescue on a failed attempt to make a chicken dinner. She goes over, and Noah seduces her, and in the vulnerable state she is in, she succumbs. The next morning, when Mrs. Peterson tries to say what a mistake had been made, we see Noah has become obsessed and now has this incident to use as blackmail. Part of the problem with this movie is there is not enough character development. It would've been better if it toyed with your emotions, making you first really like Noah before he becomes evil; but the movie gives you a creepy feeling about Noah right from the beginning, in his action, in his dialogue, and even in the music they play right from the opening credits. Overall the whole plot is pretty far-fetched. Not a great work of art, but bottom line the movie does make you wonder how it's going to end. Unfortunately not even the ending is that exciting.",The Boy Next Door
108,lars-viebrock,Exceedingly terrible!,2,4 April 2021,"A movie with JLo in a leading role should have been warning enough, but I was still curious.The movie is super cliché, the acting, screenplay, and character development is absolutely terrible.The son and his new friend look mid twenties, to early thirties. How easily the son is swayed and manipulated is hilarious and stupid.JLo's character acts extremely stupid throughout the film, making her extremely unlikable.There is really nothing good about this movie, but here go a few funny scenes:when the father picks up his son from school and lets him drive his car, we immediately cut to a scene where they drive on a twisty mountain road. The son then confronts his father with how he left him or some bs, then proceeds to angrily drive too fast. The brakes fail and they have to drive off into water barrels to stop the car.How did they get to this place without the brakes failing before? I mean the bad guy tempered with the car so that the brakes fail... then the dad drove all the way to the school without any issue, then the son drove to mountain road without problem and then hell broke lose all at once!Didn't they talk before this scene or why did they start arguing just there?Why do you hear the car shift and accelerate after each corner? Why is he still on the throttle? Even without braking the car should slow down at some point, or did everything fail at the same time?When they crash into the barrels you can clearly see that the car has zero scratches... probably rented the car for a day and couldn't break it within budget.the bad guy completely mutualizes another student, who now apparently has a broken skull... the co-principal now argues and argues with the and guy and ultimately decides he is suspended.Errrr what?

Mortified by her indiscretion and finally ready to welcome her husband back into her life, Claire tries to break it off, but Noah's interest in her turns out to be more of an obsession and one which he'll kill in order to feed.The Boy Next Door definitely qualifies as a low budget thriller. Despite being made for just $4 million by a first time writer and unknown director, they've attracted big enough names to lure audiences.Chenoweth shows some range outside of her twee, grinning showgirl bit, holding her own against psychotic Noah and Lopez is as good a girl-next-door as ever. You wouldn't expect to see these two in a quick and clever thriller and it's wise to approach The Boy Next Door with that level of expectation.
While it starts off well and there's some palpable tension throughout, rather than building to a climax, the story unravels away from those trying to tell it until it's trashed by an inexplicably gruesome final scene.",The Boy Next Door

It's a film for those lonely housewives who watch the LMN network. If you similarly remember FEAR with Mark Wahlberg, then you're better off watching that than this. FEAR was over-dramatic and a little unbelievable but at least Mark was intimidating and you could tell why she's afraid. In The Boy Next Door, the ""boy"" isn't even close to the word intimidation.

Because all the clichés are easy to be spotted, the audience can easily expect the predictable which completely destroys the suspense and the foreshadowing. I think the ONLY reason it made money was because of the sex scenes.The film feels rushed, with no character development or any chemistry being created between all the cast. Most of the characters just show up in some scenes and then disappear without affecting the plot; maybe they are just here for a quick paycheck. I blame it on the script which had so many gap holes that left so many questions unanswered. The acting is horrendous especially Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman's acting. Guzman is supposed to give a reliable impression of a character with psychological problems, but he fails to deliver that performance. Jennifer Lopez fails to connect with her character. In some scenes she remembers to play as her character but in the majority of this film she forgets to act. AS A RESULT, Lopez proved, in this film, why she needs to WIN the golden raspberry award. In the 2002 film, Enough, she displayed a far better performance than here. I do not recommend this movie unless you are a big fan of Jennifer Lopez, but I warned you, you will be disappointed.

The story was bad, the dialogue was bad and the acting, particularly from Jennifer Lopez was bad, in her case horrendous. This is a story about a woman who has an affair with her 20 year old neighbor. To make things worse is the kid befriends her son. Then it goes downhill after she decides that what she is doing is wrong. He gets upset and starts on a path that the most diabolical person wouldn't do. There is nothing about this movie that is going to make you think, nothing that will make you wonder what will happen next and you'll be glad there isn't a sequel because if there is a sequel there could be a chance somebody could kidnap you and force you to watch this movie. Yes it's that bad. I recently went to my elementary school children's Christmas presentation of A Christmas Carol. The 9 and 10 year old children were more believable in characters of the visiting ghosts as Jennifer Lopez is in this movie. I never had anything against her, I even find her attractive but with only looks she should be thanking her stars she has had any kind of success in Hollywood. Would I recommend this movie?

Please don't watch this. Choose another decent thriller or watch Fatal Attraction again for a decent version of what this is attempting to be.It started well albeit predictably. And I generally like Jennifer Lopez & Kristen Chenoweth so thought I was in safe hands. But as others say, the lad next door goes from being understandably appealing to a near-divorcée, to a complete and utter maniac in a matter of seconds. He claims he loves her and then does a set of weird things to upset, damage her career, kill her husband and son and so it gets crazier until the final scene which is just plain silly. Her response from the beginning considering he is 19 and therefore over the age of consent is downright ridiculous. Of course, she must be careful being an older woman but all she had to do was pick up the phone and report her worries to the police. I guess that would have been a pretty boring and short film though.

The final ""kill"" sequence was so convoluted, I had to turn the movie off (I have no idea what happened in the final ten minutes, I was so bored and frustrated). The boy next door, who has now moved into serial killer status, has all but shacked up in the object of his desire's best friend's house (whom he's already murdered). He makes a phone call, inviting her son, who is also with his father (J Lo's ex-and-kindly-cheating husband), asking them to join him (they don't know he's the bad guy yet)! With a parsed together taped recording of the best friend's voice (that sounds more animatronic than the chorus at Chuck E Cheese), he lures Clare (J Lo), as well! A stroke of luck, as it brings everyone's into the same place at the same time! Super tidy!Also, lucky, Clare buys the terrible recording, without question, then thinks nothing of it when the power is out, and the lights won't turn on! Instead of putting two and two together, she proceeds inside. Wandering around, blindly, she stumbles upon her dead friend's body.J Lo does give us a scream, here, that inspires a little appreciation. It _sounds_ like she's really freaked. But, again, instead of taking her phone out and calling the cops right then and there, instead of doing it once she has her head together and has all but cleared the door, she waits until she's in her car! And, when they pick up, instead of screaming (once the boy comes into view), screaming that she needs help, to send someone right away (after all, she's got a few seconds, and the dude is already mad as hell, anyway!). Instead of all that, she hangs up.It's just one calamity after another.

They both nailed the show with awesome performance and facial expressions. Especially i liked the way Noah turned into something different in the second half of the movie. He totally did justice to the role of a psychopath. I may not be convinced of the end but the performance and a sense of thrill was successfully portrayed by the director. Even the role played by Lopez's best friend was also appreciating. What i wanted the end was that the writer should have made some work in order to bring the NOAH towards happy and content life instead of killing him at the end because the one whom he loved was able to change his mentality with love and care.,The Boy Next Door

134,igstevensons,Not as bad as many reviews say it is,6,1 March 2015,OK this is no Fatal Attraction in terms of suspense or tension and the whole film almost entirely predictable but as entertainment goes this will entertain. The title says boy next door which should really be man next door as 27 year old Guzman is cast as a boy or at least a nineteen year old but looks so much older while Lopez never really convinces as she doesn't appears to be overly concerned despite her whole life crumbling around her but does at least look good. There is no real character development and no interesting characters other than the character played by Kristin Chenowet who despite looking like Cameron Diaz gone wrong at least provides some interest. If this type of film is your thing then I would recommend the vastly superior The Resident with Hilary Swank who is a far better actress then Lopez but if you have a couple of spare hours and don't have to pay for the privilege of watching it then you will be entertained and is certainly not as bad as many of the reviews claim.,The Boy Next Door

PUNN INTENDED!!By 42 minutes into this film my mind was completely made up about this film! I honestly can not even decide what is the worst part of this it. It was all just so horrible.

Even Kristin Chenoweth who is USUALLY a pretty good actress was terrible in this film. Everyone's so called acting was down right embarrassing.The Plot is one I'm always interested as I've mentioned in a previous review, I do love a teacher student affair. But much like my last review, this movie was nothing short of a disappointment. So the plot I liked. Now we move on to the dislikes.... The script, the acting, the fact that everything was done a little over the top, like they were trying too hard. It also really irritated me that he was a 20 year old senior?? I understand this happens, but not often enough for it to fly in a movie. I'm only 56 minutes into it. So perhaps some amazing twists are about to arise and change my whole perspective on the film. If this unlikely event happens, I will gladly retract all previous statements. However I have a feeling my review will stand. If your still seeing this, don't waste your time on this ridiculous excuse for a film.",The Boy Next Door

There was nothing inherently bad about this movie although it isn't an Oscar worthy piece of art. I was entertained by the movie but read the reviews before watching...prepared myself for the worst...after watching...walked away scratching my head wondering why professional critics made such a big deal about this movie and why it is deemed so bad...to me, it was entertaining...and kept my attention.

This is by no means a ""good"" movie, in the stylistic or symbolic sense, though it does have good entertainment value. J Lo is beautiful, the music choices are good, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, quivering with the suspense and tension.It is similar in plot and feeling as the 2007 film ""Disturbia"" starring Shia LaBeouf, but just a cheaper, flimsier version with less plot and more sex scenes. I would recommend you watch Disturbia over this movie, but if you've already seen it or if what I've just described to you seems to be more your thing, than by all means you should give this movie a watch. This movie does not deserve the reviews that other users have left, because it was not created to be a cinematic masterpiece, but created to keep you interested and maybe shock you a little.

After all those years, Jennifer Lopez still makes for a good female lead and great movies. This really is an atmospheric film, beautifully shot, with great performances all around. The tension grows throughout the film. Also, there are really funny moments in it (that made everyone laugh!) Don't listen to the critics, they don't know what they're talking about.

The plot is trite, the characters thinly drawn, the dialogue inane and the acting is more wooden than Pinocchio. Clearly it's just a vanity project for Jennifer Lopez.There are some very strange elements that occur during the movie which lead me to think that perhaps a lot of content was left on the cutting room floor. Heck, if they wanted to create quality I think they should have left the whole movie on the floor! This film bills itself as an erotic thriller...Trust me, there's nothing erotic or thrilling about this film.All that said though, I almost died of laughter watching this, and for that, I'm giving it two out of ten stars.

Why expect anything else? You're setting yourself up for disappointment. I don't understand all the one star reviews. This movie is a carbon copy of every ""erotic thriller/stalker"" movie ever produced in the 90's and early 2000's. (Fatal Attraction, Mother's Boys, swimfan, The Roommate, Obsessed, etc.) Lopez and Guzman are FINE here (as is Kristin Chenoweth, who very nearly steals the show. BRAVO!). Those three turn in decent performances and their work actually carries an otherwise stale script, which is the biggest problem here. The dialogue is pretty stiff. The actors are working their butts off to make it all seem plausible, but its just not and that fault lies with newcomer Barbara Curry, who wrote that drivel. Someone should have given the script a good ""once over"" with a red pen and the problems in the final product may have been removed altogether. Seriously, this movie is harmless.

Jennifer Lopez plays a married woman who's been cheated on and who is teetering between divorce and reconciliation. The student is nineteen but in high school. He also killed his parents.

The pace is WAY too fast, we don't have ANY time to become emotionally invested in the characters, and the acting is ""meh"". There aren't any ""at the edge of your seat"" moments because you always know exactly what's going to happen.

And who knows what's in the mind of someone who looks polite, gentle and is very attractive, especially if he has fallen in love, is very jealous and sees the ex husband coming back. Overall the actors do a decent job, the dialogs are not very sophisticated but they are what you could expect from this kind of mid class American neighborhood.

149,jcallanan90,Yet another awful J-Lo movie,1,23 June 2016,"The Boy Next Door...where do I begin. The first thing that I'll say is, Jennifer Lopez is in the movie. I'd like to leave it at that, but, unfortunately, I can't. Jennifer Lopez once again did an awful job acting in a movie. Jennifer Lopez is an awful actress to begin with. Ryan Guzman was also horrible in this movie. I humoured my girlfriend and went to see it, and I regretted spending the money on our tickets. The acting was awful all together. Sure, it's an interesting story. A married lady (Lopez) who has been cheated on falls for a lonely boy (Guzman) who takes a romantic and sexual interest in her, who then becomes obsessed with her and wants her all for himself. Guzman got more creepy than obsessive (yes, I know what I said), making his performance even worse. I love movies like this, and if they had cast better actors to play Lopez and Guzman's parts, it could have been so exciting! Instead, I dealt with giggly old women, watching Ryan Guzman put no emotion into his role, and Jennifer Lopez's horrible acting (I can't stress enough) for 1 hour and 31 minutes. I'll give J-Lo credit for continuing her acting career. Maybe she'll be great in something over the next few years, but she was terrible in this movie, as well as others (remember Gigli?), and shouldn't have been cast in it. The Boy Next Door is 1 out of 10 stars in my book.",The Boy Next Door
150,chris-vialls,Worst film of 2015 (so far),2,28 February 2015,"Oh dear....It was actually laughably bad(There were people laughing out loud at some bits). Lets start of with the acting, in some bits it was alright, but some of the scenes felt so awkward and shoddy, like they had done it on only 1 take. Secondly, the characters are all f****** Generic, Jennifer Lopez plays as some newly separated wife, filing for divorce, and looking to hot for her age. Her husband, some business man who is in an affair with his secretary or something, and then their son, who is also allergic to everything and is been bullied at school(also the bullies are pretty generic), wow, the originality. Thirdly, the plot SUCKS, its just so predictable, A teacher has an affair with a student and the student is the bad guy. What kind of drugs are the directors on? The student is nineteen but in high school. He also killed his parents(yeah, there is some stupid subplot about him murdering his parents, which makes no sense). So he is a psychopath(he is also a white, heterosexual male). I could have written something way better, sure it would take a while to wright a whole new screenplay, it would be better. Fourthly, the plot holes in this film are AWFUL, the worst was right at the end, where there is some generic fight scene, basically, Jennifer Lopez knocks Ryan Guzman to the floor, who has a gun, so instead of PICKING UP THE GUN, she tries to free her son(who is tied up), even though 2 bullets to Ryan's head would have cut this fight scene by at least 4 minutes. There was also this cliché bit where Jennifer Lopez is about to be killed by Ryan, and then she standing next to a switch, which she flicks causing like a giant brick to collapse onto Ryan killing him(how convenient), I swear like several people just burst out laughing at that bit. This film feels incredibly rushed. The end feels like they had run out of money, it just ends so terribly. The good: There was some good build up and also a few tense bits. The credits song at the end was pretty cool as well, but thats about it. TL:DR: This sucked, it really is trash, thankfully I only wasted my time, and not my money with this.

We literally laughed through the entire film - and what was even more fun was that the entire theater was laughing, too. The dialogue and plot were so thin and badly written, and the intense scenes so implausible, that it was hilarious. As the movie ended, I think all of us sat staring at the screen wondering if that really was the ending - that the credits were about to prove it was all over - that me, my friend, and the entire theater, cracked up all over again.So, I have absolutely no regrets about paying money to see it.

Ian Nelson does well as the troubled teen in a non-annoying way (which I did not expect at all). but the biggest surprise comes from Ryan Guzman. known for his Step Up role proved he can legitimately act, his transformation was sudden enough to be thrilling yet slow enough that it can be understood. it jumps at points but isn't all that scary.

153,guidohollands,The failure next door,4,15 April 2015,"A simple review of this movie could be done in five words: this is a bad movie. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? Not by far, but it's one of those flix that should have been released straight to DVD, yet somehow made it to the big screen, probably because of the leading role of Jennifer Lopez. First of all I didn't choose to see this movie, I saw it during a sneak preview, so I didn't know what to expect.First things first: Jennifer Lopez is the only good thing in this movie, not because of her acting skills (remember Anaconda?) but because she still looks really good at her age. Having said that, the rest of the movie is one big roller-coaster ride of utter disbelieve and boredom.The Boy next door is supposed to be an erotic thriller, yet the only erotic thing in the entire movie are the end credits, as most of the audience will experience this as the climax of their evening. The story is simple: Claire (as played by Jennifer Lopez) is a high school teacher on the brink of a divorce. Noah, her new next door twenty-something neighbor, is obsessed by Claire, which is clear from the beginning of the movie. At the first meeting, Noah offers to fix her garage door (no pun intended), an offer she accepts. Noah, awesome as he is, paints her entire garage at once. Claire doesn't find this strange at all, because if there's one thing people do when they first meet is fix each-others houses (wtf?). Claire's teenage son Kevin idolizes Noah for his car repair skills (this guy can fix anything!) The two become friends and Noah becomes a frequent visitor in Claire's house. Of course Noah has been casted for his looks as well, so Claire can't keep her eyes of him and yada yada the two make the beast with two backs.From this moment on the entire movie is about Noah trying to get in on with Claire for a second time and her rejecting him. This of course leads to tension between Claire, Noah, her son and her ex husband. Everything is so cliché and done before, it feels like you're watching an r-rated Lifetime movie. I'm not going to spoil the 'exciting' scenes for you, but let's just say there are non.And then comes the final scene. Suddenly you've gone from watching a stalker movie to watching a gory slasher movie. This was where I had my first genuine laugh because that scene was just so..so..bad.Avoid this movie if you can.",The Boy Next Door

Doesn't JLo care about furthering her career? For some reasons she thinks that' she's untouchable. You would think that someone with JLo's savvyness would know to stay away from garbage like this, but maybe she's trying to remain relevant at her age. Maybe it feeds her ego to star opposite someone 20 years her junior. I don't understand why JLo is the success that she is. She has had so many flops and yet she manages to push on as if it's just one success after another. I have always thought that JLo was totally overrated and this movie proves it.

I really think this movie would be great for a girls night!! It's just one of those movies that keeps your attention and has you going OMG!! Did that just happen?! It was so enticing, full of drama and suspense! I watched this movie, a little skeptical because of all the bad reviews, but take my word for it and watch it. It was sooo good!!!

Everyone in the theater jumped in their seats at the same moments (which was hilarious). Ryan Guzman did an awesome job of being cute and scary at the same time and Jennifer Lopez (even with the usual cheesy thriller script) was somehow able to get into this role and show that she is a great actress. I appreciated the back story to why the characters were flawed (to the point where I felt bad for all involved, even Ryan's character). Oh, and the whole uneasiness of a teacher and her student was not an issue for me. Watch the movie and you'll know why. I don't usually post reviews but I thought a lot of these negative reviews are uncalled for. Nothing about this movie or its promotion indicates its vying for movie of the year, but it was fun, sexy, a little disturbing, and worth the money if you like thrillers.",The Boy Next Door

162,p-schecter,"I didn't expect it to be that bad,but...",5,24 May 2015,"The film is a typical guilty pleasure thriller with some erotic elements. The only difference between this film and ''The Stepfather'', for example, is the rating. (PG-13 vs R). Of course, such films are called guilty pleasures for a reason. Even though it's not such a bad way to waste 90 minutes of your time, ''The Boy Next Door'' has very awkward script, awkward editing and in their attempt to make the film fast-paced, they end up making it full of awkward 10-second-long scenes and very cringeworthy dialogue at times. Yes, the sex scene was steamy, that's for sure, but that wasn't the point of the whole film. Even that particular scene felt awkward, like everything else about the second attempt at screen writing by Barbara Curry. Jennifer Lopez' acting was fine, considering the role she was given, but I felt like Ryan Guzman and the actor who plays Kevin had more chemistry than Lopez & Guzman in that hardware store scene, even though there was nothing sexual about it and considering the characters' heterosexual orientation. The best scene was probably when the character of J Lo stabbed Guzman's ''Noah"" in the eye - it was a bit gory, but definitely fun. I absolutely hated the end, it just lacked proper closure or even a predictable twist. Overall, I give this film a 5 out of 10, simply because I like the both leads, it had some fun moments and interesting scenes, and despite constantly cringing throughout this 90-minute guilty pleasure, I enjoyed it.

I would've given the movie a solid 8 in the beginning. That devolved as the movie passed. But the end, oh the end. THE END WAS TRULY HORRIFYING AND IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH BEING CALLED A MOVIE AFTER SEEING THAT!! I acknowledge that psychopaths exist but this guy must be the biggest lunatic in human history...

Like: where did Noah get the voice recording of Vicky from? How big mustn't that printer have been if it could print such an amount of pictures without running out of ink? Also there should have been a lot more if it had copied all night long... Why is mister Sandborn suddenly back in his house? Why does mister Sandborn have no clue about anything that Noah done/did and if he did, who would want a lunatic like that living in their house? Why doesn't Claire call the cops any earlier? Why is there no blood in Vicky's living room if you can clearly see she was hit and had bled during the phone scene? When would Noah have had access to Garrett's Challenger? And most of all, why the hell is Claire so passive and unundertaking, come on, this guy has killed your best friend, tied up and tortured your husband and tied up your son. How can you not want to smash him in his face? I could probably go on forever with this.

I think we should make a movie where Burt Reynolds, who is about the same age as picante pants, seduces Kiernan Shipka. I would love to see them advertise this. They won't and you get my point.

Claire is just like any other woman who has been cheated and feels vulnerable and we all (women) have these moments. She finds in Noah the pleasure that she was seeking after so long but could't imagine how the situation would turn out. Turns out to be that the boy next door full of love promises and a with the hottest body around is actually a psycho and cannot let her in peace. The movie surprises you from the beginning to end.

Remember Joey Buttafucco of Jersey in the eighties.Some of the lines were cheesy but it didn't take away from the good script, solid acting, and the beauty that is Ms. Lopez.

Those who do not know him, Rob Cohen is the guy who directed 'The Skulls', 'The Fast And The Furious', and 'xXx'. A man like Rob Cohen is not without his merits (we would give 'TFATF' an 8 out of 10 any day of the week), but we really have to understand what to expect. Cohen is not Clint Eastwood and he doesn't try to be. He is not trying to change the world. He just wants to make films that people might enjoy.With that in mind, 'The Boy Next Door' is enjoyable......it is easy to see why so many have disliked this film and critics have absolutely slammed it. It does seem like Rob Cohen has lost a little of his touch. However, we can't really expect it to be anything more than a popcorn flick. Watch this on a rainy Sunday afternoon when you can take it at face value and not try to search for any hidden meanings or socio-political commentaries. You MIGHT just be entertained!(Full review at www.thereeljunkie.com)",The Boy Next Door
171,Bethan-vickery,Not worth the money,1,4 March 2015,"One of the worst films I've seen in a very long time. From the outset the acting was corny and the storyline predictable. I particularly disliked the anti-feminist theme throughout and found it uncomfortable to watch at times. Apart from the story line being so far fetched and unrealistic I thought the '15' rating did not truly reflect the use of language and explicitness of the sex scene. There was some really nasty language and the sex scene was very racy, both of which I would expect to find in a film rated 18, definitely not 15, and I was quite shocked when it happened. If I was watching this film on my TV at home I would've shut it off half way through it is truly truly bad.",The Boy Next Door
172,baby-02484,Not good,1,29 May 2015,I have never watched such a stupid movie! It was good as it started and usually movies build a character and the plot thickens but this movie didn't hit those points. Emotions are too extreme and random and so are the scenes. There is strange behavior in every scene which makes it laughable. Our whole row just laughed at this movie! There are a few suspenseful scenes but they die out quick with a stupid follow up scene. Also Jennifer Lopez's hair looked awful! I thought it was gonna be a good movie but it wasn't good at all. With Jennifer Lopez in it I really that it was gonna be good. Out of all the movies that she has done this one would have to be the worse on of them all. I would not recommend my family or friends to watch it. Through half of the movie I was bored. Plus it was short. I thought it would at least go on for another 30 to 40 minutes before it ended. She was good in the movie. But the movie part was stupid. At the end that's when it got interesting but it was short. I loved the title of the movie just not the movie itself. It not a good movie at all.,The Boy Next Door
173,cberner-15927,Bad movie,1,25 June 2015,"To start j-lo is looking old, not to happy bout that. The movies plot is solid but the acting was trash. The ending isn't that good kinda left you hanging. It has lots of sex so don't watch with your mom. Kind of gross and bloody too. If you enjoy pointless movies and wasting about an hour and a half of your life then definitely keep this movie in mind! If you enjoy a creepy rapey vibe for your date night, this would be a good pick! I'm upset with myself for wasting precious time of my life watching this piece of garbage. I have watched a lot of movies in my time and this is possibly one of the worst. Every movie has some fans though so somebody must have enjoyed it. Carry on I wouldn't watch this movie if I were you, continue at your own risk!",The Boy Next Door
174,GansettGirl,Why is this movie appealing?,3,23 January 2016,"This is horrible. Ms. Jennifer Lawrence has gone from one bad movie to the next and I would suggest she stop trying to make movies. Her only appeal in this arena is her sensuality. As for Mr. Guzman, he seems to be on the same career path. He is cute but I think he needs to something with more substance if he plans on making a living at this. I was surprised that John Corbett and Kristen Chenoweth were in this because I like anything either one does. Both of their performances were the most convincing of the group. Otherwise it could have been a porn movie tease. It is not an original plot by a long shot. As has been mentioned in previous posts, there are several movies over the decades that have this same story line and most of them were much better than this.",The Boy Next Door
