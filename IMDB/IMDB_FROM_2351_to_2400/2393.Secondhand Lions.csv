0,MartinHafer,Very odd...but very satisfying.,9,19 December 2020,"The story is set in the early 1960s and begins with Walter (Haley Joel Osment) being dropped off at his very strange great-uncles' home in the middle of no where Texas. The mother is a very irresponsible sort and apparently her taking off without the boy is nothing new. But in this case, she's dropped the boy off with some folks who at first seem ill-equipped to care for a growing boy. The old men (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) are certainly crusty old characters....who seem to have little fear or common sense. But over time, they form a sweet bond with the boy...and the story is odd, to say the least, but also very satisfying.This film is quirky beyond belief. But it somehow works due to excellent direction, acting and an overall sweet production with lovely music and cinematography. An odd little film whose strange parts all add up to a lovely family film well worth your time.",Secondhand Lions
1,SnoopyStyle,Haley Joel Osment growing awkward,5,25 July 2014,Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is left by his gold digging mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) with his eccentric great-uncles Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall) in rural Texas. She thinks they've hidden a fortune somewhere and hopes they would leave it all to her. Their other relatives come sniffing around and they're not happy at Walter being there. Meanwhile they are hounded by salesmen who are always trying to take advantage of them. Then they buy a secondhand lion to shoot.HJO is growing older and this is the awkward stage. He doesn't have quite the same cuteness and is much too stiff. I can see this role more fitting him as his younger self. His lack of expressions worked as a child but is a hindrance as he gets older. The story is a gentle memory of a fanciful tale. Writer/director Tim McCanlies isn't bringing anything particularly interesting. It's all left up to the veterans Duvall and Caine. They are able to salvage a little bit but not all of it.,Secondhand Lions
2,classicsoncall,"""Sometimes, the things that may or may not be true, are the things that a man needs to believe in the most.""",9,15 January 2007,"It's too bad this film had such a short theatrical run, and that it's hardly remembered even from a few years ago. Like 1988's ""The Milagro Beanfield War"", this little gem deserves a much wider audience, and I count it among my favorite films that no one's ever heard of. Not quite a coming of age story for Haley Joel Osmont's character, it serves up grand adventure and a pair of dysfunctional aging uncles who come to be the only real family young Walter (Osmont) will ever know. As he envisions Uncle Garth's (Michael Caine) tall tales of evil sheiks and swordplay in Africa, Walter will grow to understand that courage, honor and virtue are the most important things in life and that true love never dies.With this film, along with ""Open Range"" and AMC's production of ""Broken Trail"", Robert Duvall has become my favorite 'modern day' actor. He seems to create his characters effortlessly, becoming who they are with such ease that it's a wonder to behold. His performances almost transcend acting per se, in a way that we no longer see Duvall in a role, we see a cantankerous old uncle or a grizzly trail rider without celebrity getting in the way. I'm not sure if I can make that statement about any other famous personality in film today.It's only marginally important that a real lion was introduced into the story to support the title, the real 'secondhand lions' are Uncle Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Duvall), noble beasts in their heyday who have different ways of winding down their lives and passing on their legacies to a hand me down nephew. Even though they've outlived their time, they're not about to spend the rest of their lives rocking on the porch, unless it's armed with a shotgun and an idea of what the next great adventure might be.",Secondhand Lions
3,ccthemovieman-1,Easy To Recommend,10,5 February 2006,"It sounds like a cliché, but I don't know anybody who didn't like this film. I recommended it to a number of people, and all were impressed with it as I was.Excellent acting and an interesting low-key story make this a very enjoyable 110 minutes of entertainment. A story about two old geezers who take in a 14-year- old to their home for a month doesn't sound too exciting but this film will surprise you.It's tough to find two elder gentlemen as good and appealing as Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, anyway, so you have two winners right there. Add a fine, fine young actor in Haley Joel Osment and now you have three excellent actors who comprise most of the lines of the film.This is one of those rare ""guarantee"" movies in which you can safely tell your friends to watch it and not regret the recommendation.",Secondhand Lions
4,blanche-2,Fantastic,10,1 February 2017,"Michael Caine and Robert Duvall are the ""Secondhand Lions"" in this 2003 film featuring Haley Joel Osment, Kyra Sedgwick and Josh Lucas.Set in 1962, Caine and Duvall are brothers Garth and Hub, in their fifties when the film begins. They live an isolated life with five dogs and a pig on a farm. They mostly sit on the porch with rifles and shoot at salespeople -- the word is out that Garth and Hub have amassed a fortune.This knowledge attracts unwelcome relatives to the farm as well. One day their floozie niece (Sedgwick) drops off her quiet, sad son Walter and heads for a courtroom transcriber school. So she says. What she wants is for Walter to find their uncles' money while she's away.Garth and Hub don't want Walter, but soon, the boy begins to enjoy himself. One day a salesman comes to offer Garth and Hub a skeet shooter. They're about to pull their guns when Walter says, What good is money if you don't spend it? Soon the men are buying all kinds of things, including new clothes for yard work for themselves and Walter, seeds for planting, and a lion they plan on shooting. The lion they get is female and old - and they don't end up shooting it.Walter finds a photo of a beautiful woman in his room and asks Garth about it. Garth tells Walter stories about the mens' adventures when they were young, which include fighting off a sheikh in a distant land and saving the fair Jasmine, whom Hub marries and is the woman in the photo. But she's not there now, and Walter wonders what happened to her.What a beautiful film that shows the power of love and connection as these two grouches, considering their lives over, save this boy, bounced around while his mother finds new boyfriends, and how he enriches theirs. There is a great deal of humor and poignancy here. This is so much more than a family film. You have two stellar actors, Caine and Duval, for one thing, a beautiful performance by Osment, and excellent supporting players, particularly Sedgwick, a favorite of mine.I've probably seen about 4500 films in my life, most of which are reviewed by me on IMDb. Discounting the classics of the Golden Era and just taking the post-1960 films, I think some of the best were Road to Perdition, Phoenix, No Country for Old Men, Interiors, Remember, Divided We Fall, Run Lola Run -- in the end, maybe 25 stick out as being special. This is one.I think today with so much turmoil around us, we need to get in touch with some simpler values and take a break from all of the dark films and the CGI technique once in a while. There is nothing hokey about this film, and I highly recommend it.",Secondhand Lions
5,Coventry,Long live the old guys!!,8,11 January 2004,"Oh man, this is such a great movie. It's was even better that I'd hoped and I'm very glad I've seen it in the theater. I was expecting to see a good old-fashioned solid story with terrific acting performances but yet, I feared a bit that it would be too sentimental and emotional at times. Well, that was unjustified. The films does contain quite a bit of sentiment but it doesn't get irritant or over-the-top once! Secondhand Lions is fun for all audiences. Cinema buffs will love it for the on-screen chemistry between legendary actors Michael Caine and Robert Duvall and occasional filmfans will adore it for the heart-warming and humoristic story. In the very first place, it's a story about getting older and departed glory and memories, but it's also a morality lesson about greed and respect. Secondhand Lions tells the story of the eccentric lives of two brothers ( Glorious roles for Duvall and Caine ). Through flashbacks and stories, they share their memories with a 14-year old nephew ( Haley Joel-""I see dead people""- Osmont ) who got left behind by his irresponsible mother. All kind of rumours and ghost-stories are said about the two brothers...They're supposed to be filthy rich and that attracts all kind of uninvited visitors. From intrusive salesmen to blood-sucking relatives who're only after the money. Thanks to all the diversity in topics, Secondhand Lions doesn't contain one dull moment. The brothers undertake numberless new actions like hunting a lion, building airplanes and fighting with much younger men. All this is brought with an amazing sense of humor and light-headed enthusiasm. Writer-director Tim McCanlies certainly is a name to remember for the future...I'm sure I'll be looking forward to see more of his work. He even has a great knowledge in selecting music and locations...The settings and score of Secondhand Lions are of the many highlights in this film. But, first and foremost, it remains an acting tour-de-force by both Duvall as Caine. The interaction between them and the common suspicion towards outsiders is just brilliant. These man are a long way from being 'washed up', I assure you. A must see and one of the greatest movies in the overall disappointing cinema-year 2003!!",Secondhand Lions
6,LeonLouisRicci,"Wonderful, Good-Looking, and Inspirational Family Fun",8,28 December 2015,"Once in awhile Hollywood takes a chance on a Family Friendly throwback to an innocent age before the Code broke down and a Rating System was installed. A time when Movies at times, and audiences were routinely given a joyful juvenile fun filled escape with poignant Life Lessons that entertained. Fairy Tales and Storylands unscathed by cynicism.Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, and Harry Osmet are forced into approximation and the screen comes alive with a Coming-of-Age Tale of Male Bonding and Wonder. The Movie is expertly imaged with swashbuckling adventure and contains wishful things like True Love, being a Real Man, and animal sidekicks.Some say that this is pure Cornball and the Film knows that and plays it well. A beautiful looking Film, but the Critics were tepid. One wonders why and perhaps it's all that cynicism that infects the intellectual with a worn out attitude and the heart suffers. Inspirational, charming, and certainly a treat for Family viewing.",Secondhand Lions
7,dbborroughs,I love this movie,9,11 November 2008,"Robert Duvall and Michael Caine in a movie written and directed by the screenwriter of the Iron Giant.(yes he's credited with the screenplay) Insert Grin here.Oh please you know where its going but it detours so nicely every which way you don't care.The cast is great, the story funny and touching. No, you won't blather like at the end of Iron Giant, but you will feel warm and toasty.My complaints, and there are two, are as follows: First the mother of Haley Joel Osment is annoying as all hell and while its required to set the movie in motion, I wish she was more realistic instead of a cartoon. The same goes for the other group of relatives that drops in from time to time. They are used to comic effect nicely but they are too cartoony.The second is the whole bit when the mother returns with the boyfriend to pick up Osment. Yes its the deus ex machina that gets us to the warm and fuzzy ending, but its the one plot false note in the whole thing...Other than that its just a lot of fun.I am curious how much studio tinkering was done since once or twice I thought it had been trimmed.No matter. See this film.",Secondhand Lions
8,ferguson-6,Not much roar in this lion,7,22 October 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  This is a fine mainstream movie that most family members can enjoy.  The problems occur when one tries to look much deeper.  As a film lover, I will never miss an opportunity to see screen legends Michael Caine (with a Texas accent?) and Robert Duvall work together.  They are masters of their craft.  Also, to watch the development of Haley Joel Osment as a teen actor holds some interest.  Although, in this movie, he provides no answers as to whether he has a future in films.  He has the crying on demand and skittish nature to play the wounded young teen, but whether he has the skill to carry a more difficult role remains to be seen.  His awkward appearance will not help.  Director Tim McCanlies (from SMU in Dallas) does a nice job of filmmaking with the limited script.  Every scene cut too early - leaving the audience with an empty feeling on what is really going on with these two fascinating, anything-but-senior citizens. The whole thing with Nikki Katt and Kyra Sedgwick was just plain terrible and embarrassing for all involved.  This movie only works when Caine and Duvall are onscreen.",Secondhand Lions
9,anaconda-40658,Duvall and Caine Are the Lions.,7,15 September 2015,"Secondhand Lions (2003): Dir: Tim McCanlies / Cast: Haley Joel Osment, Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, Kyra Sedgwick, Nicky Katt: Enchanting comedy about storytelling. Title refers to an old transported lion as well as the two uncles and their brave tales. Haley Joel Osment is sent to stay with his uncles for the summer. They tell of adventures involving theft, war, Princesses, gold, and the ever present glow of romance. It is difficult to tell whether the stories are true but director Tim McCanlies details the film with ideas that provide great visual elements that enhance the imagination much as it does Osment. Robert Duvall and Michael Caine are hilarious and genuine as the uncles. Caine tells Osment of Duvall's lost romance and the reason behind his sleepwalking. It is obvious that by the end of the film the two uncles will fully adapt to having this kid around but the leads add a great deal of fun to it all. Osment is superb sporting curiosity as to what is fact and fiction but will ultimately have to deal with other issues in his life. Kyra Sedgwick plays his mother in what is the most unsympathetic role in the film. This is the film's biggest flaw in the mother's willingness to do what she does so willingly. Nicky Katt is featured to abuse Osment and suffer at the hands of the veterans. Heart warming film of love and friendship that should never be secondhand. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Secondhand Lions
10,HotToastyRag,It doesn't speak to the right audience,3,29 November 2017,"Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, it's a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmother's house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles' farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanlies's script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesn't really work.Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haley's great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latter's character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesn't resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesn't work: it's not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of ""girl power"" that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I can't imagine a man of Robert Duvall's age truly believing that all people are good.",Secondhand Lions
11,Wuchakk,Learning about life from your two eccentric uncles in central Texas,7,13 July 2021,"In the summer of 1962, a troubled, introverted boy (Haley Joel Osment) is dropped off by his dubious mother (Kyra Sedgwick) at the remote home of his two great-uncles in central Texas (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall). His money-loving mom and other relatives are only interested in their (supposed) hidden cache of wealth while the kid simply needs their acceptance, wisdom and love.""Secondhand Lions"" (2003) is a quirky coming-of-age drama that combines elements of ""A Perfect World"" (1993) and ""Sling Blade"" (1996) with the amusement of Indiana Jones, ""Simon Birch"" (1998) and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000). It's entertaining, enlightening and heartwarming all at the same time. Yet it's more than just a coming-of-age drama because it effectively addresses one's usefulness in life after his/her physical prime. It's also a good animal flick, although they're peripheral.The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in the Austin, Texas, area, including Pflugerville, Manor (fight at store) & Lockhart, Texas.GRADE: B.",Secondhand Lions
12,StevePulaski,Firsthand direction,9,22 November 2011,"Secondhand Lions tells the precious and harmless parable about a teenage boy that practically gets abandoned by his mother and left in the care of his two geezer uncles. The boy is the all-grown up Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense, and the two geezers are some of the most iconic American actors who ever lift. I doubt they need a proper introduction.Osment is Walter, a shy, wimpy, lanky teen who isn't lazy as much as he is uninspired. His mother hasn't taught him anything about being a man and she usually favors lackluster boyfriends over him. Walter arrives at his Uncle's farm where Hub (Duvall) and Garth (Caine) greet him coldly. Walter is amazed that they lack the ""essentials"" for living in today's world like a telephone and a television but quickly forgets about them when the uncles tele-story.Hub and Garth tell Walter a story about how they were shanghaied in France and taken to Africa where they were forced to fight in a brutal war. Garth tells about how Hub found true love in a woman named Jasmine (Vaugier). Jasmine is forced to marry a powerful Shiek, but upon Hub rescuing her from him, a bounty is placed on his head. Following a setup, Hub and the Shiek duel and afterwards they make a deal which results in Hub and Garth becoming practically millionaires.In the present day, both men still occupy such a large amount of money that they are often the target for money hungry salesman that come by frequently looking for a quick buck. Hub and Garth's response? Shooting warning shots at them until they leave the premises. This provides much comic relief which is welcomed rather than contrived.Osment is illuminating, and the two uncles are enigmatic in the way they speak and act. Every boy should have the experience Walter had, but the problem stems from the fact that this story is heavily fictitious, and it's a doubt anything like this stems outside in the world today.Secondhand Lions is some sort of a miracle. It's a children's movie that proves to parents that good ones still exist. My question is plain and simple; why don't parents take their children to see Secondhand Lions instead of something like Big Daddy or Good Boy!? This teaches lessons. The other films teach hardly anything. Which is why to find a truly inspiring family film you have to dig deeper than any other great film of any genre.Starring: Haley Joel Osment, Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and Kyra Sedgwick. Directed by: Tim McCanlies.",Secondhand Lions
13,=G=,Nuttin' speshal,6,4 February 2004,"McCanlies doesn't have anything new, creative, unique, or special to show us in ""Secondhand Lions""; a messy and mildly entertaining story about a boy who spends a summer with a couple of supposedly rich, eccentric old uncles who share their homespun wisdom with him.  With zero awards (so far) and lukewarm critical reviews, even the Duvall/Cain star power can't save this for-boys-only family flick from its blatant mediocrity. (C+)",Secondhand Lions
14,KineticSeoul,Pretty endearing movie,8,28 February 2016,"This is actually a endearing film, sure it might not be all that realistic but endearing never the less. This is probably the movie where Haley Joel Osment was at his peak. Then his career took a nose dive, not because he isn't a talented actor, but because of genetics. It also has Robert Duvall and Michael Caine in it, it just can't go wrong with that combination. The plot is about a boy seeking a loving family and two retired old men seeking purpose and relevancy. This film sort of reminded me of ""Princess Bride"" except without the focus being on the romance. This movie delves into the history and adventures of the past while showing the build up and relationship between a boy and two old retired men. Overall, this is a dry movie, but it's a very watchable dry movie that I don't regret checking out.8/10",Secondhand Lions
15,cherold,amusing but unmoving,5,27 August 2004,"This movie starts off pretty well, as a kid's irresponsible mother dumps him with a couple of unfriendly uncles she doesn't even know.  And for the most part the movie is an enjoyably light movie with fun scenes involving traveling salesmen and worn out lions.  It's got a Disney fun-for-the-whole-family feel and comes across as something genial and likable.  Problems arise in the second half when the movie leans more heavily on dramatic elements.  The movie assumes that if you put a sad kid with a couple of colorful relatives that a deep bond will form, and that may be so, but the movie really doesn't do anything to show us happening.  They tell some entertaining stories, do some wacky stuff, and then there are tears and hugs and you just have to say, what's the big deal?  One doesn't see a real bond form between the kid and his uncles, and even the bond between the uncles is more in the telling than the showing.  The cast is good, but the writing is lazy, with a generic bad mother and the like.  The last half hour is all drama and thus all hollow and tedious.  If the movie had fulfilled the amusing promise of its first half I would have given it a 7 out of 10, but the last part barely musters a 4 so I rate the overall impact at a 5.",Secondhand Lions
16,merklekranz,The sum of the parts = very entertaining,7,18 February 2007,"Part fairytale, part tearjerker, part animal movie, generally spells disaster in a film. Not here however, as all of the parts mesh quite nicely and the result is an entertaining movie. Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, and Haley Joel Osment all give believable performances. There is imagination at work and the result is that children 8+ in addition to adults will enjoy ""Secondhand Lions"". So, if you don't mind breaking out the tissues, I recommend this as an evenings entertainment. For comparison, I would rate another tearjerker ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" 6.5., and recommend it as an excellent companion to ""Secondhand Lions"". - MERK",Secondhand Lions
17,Movie Nuttball,Secondhand Lions!,6,18 March 2004,"Secondhand Lions is a family type film that stars Michael Caine and Robert Duvall! Their acting was good especially by Duvall but I think their roles didn't allow them to do much. It just seemed like they were there only to say a few words and that was it. I think when Caine's character was telling the story and you saw all of those action scenes didn't fit in. Hey I love action in movies but in this film's case I think the movie would have been much better if those scenes were not in it. Also like the two main stars the rest of the cast could only do what they given. To be honest the best part in the film is whenever the animals are screen. The music was fine. Now on to the subject of recommending this film. I don't recommend it for fans who want to see an action film unless you want to see some action that doesn't fit in the film. However I do recommended it if you want to see a family film with some cute animals, some action, and stuff. I also recommend Secondhand Lions if you like Michael Caine and Robert Duvall. All of this is My opinion. Thanks!",Secondhand Lions
18,Ed-Shullivan,A wonderful FEEL Good adventure/fantasy filled family themed film.,10,1 November 2018,"First and foremost you have the two Academy Award winning actors Michael Caine, and Robert Duvall co-starring as two (2) old and weathered retired adventurers named Garth and Hub who have their great nephew Walter (Haley Joel Osment) dumped on them by his irresponsible mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick).The only parent the young Walter has ever known is his wild carefree mother Mae, so when Walter is dumped off by Mae on the farm belonging to the two old grumpy codgers who are well past their prime date on poor Walter feels very isolated and alone. That is until Garth (Michael Caine) starts explaining to Walter some of the wild tales (real or imagined?) that he and Hub experienced many, many years ago. The young Walter initially believes his Great Uncle Garth is filling him with just a bunch of baloney until he gets introduced to one of the farms family pets, which is an old and weathered secondhand lion named Jasmine.I was totally engrossed with both the manner in which these fables/stories were told and the actual wild and romantic stories that Garth was telling young Walter to the point that I only wished I had two great Uncles like Garth and Bud myself. This is a wonderful story filled with love, romance, adventure with an interesting story about three characters who you would never believe could live under the same roof, but yet they do and bring us the viewers along for a funtastic ride of mystical adventures and action.I loved this FEEL GOOD story and I will be sure to share it with my own grandchildren some day when they are old enough to appreciate it.A perfect 10 for 10 rating!",Secondhand Lions
19,ianlouisiana,"A gentle,almost Fordian,whimsy with revisionist undertones........",10,18 June 2009,"""Second hand lions"" sets the received gender wisdom of the last twenty years - gently - on its head.After two decades of movies dominated by strong,brave,loyal,self-reliant and confident women,it dares to show men who have those virtues - once almost their sole prerogative in Hollywood - and a woman who is weak,feckless,vain and stupid.It is set on some barren part of North Texas in 1962 - the date is on a letter opened by young master Osment - but it might as well be 1932.Dusty roads,rusting wire,dilapidated buildings dominate the scenery;you might almost expect to see Bonnie and Clyde bucketing along in the distance hotly pursued by the Law. Two brothers,Mr Michael Caine and Mr Robert Duval own a farm in this benighted part of the land but don't appear to do much farming,spending much of their time sitting on the front porch grumbling at one another with shotguns across their knees.Into this slightly bizarre household comes young master Haley Joe Osment,a boy on the cusp of adolescence who is unceremoniously dumped on them by his mother as she goes in pursuit of her latest beau. Regaled by Mr Caine with tales of the brothers' derring-do thirty years earlier,master Osment might well feel that reports of their adventures had been exaggerated except that he witnesses Mr Duval take on four knife-wielding thugs single-handedly in a bar. Deciding a lion's head might look good mounted in their den,the brothers order a lion(from Sears Roebuck second hand lions dept?)but when it arrives,old and grizzled as themselves,they are unable to shoot it and let it live in their cornfield,happy in it's own little piece of jungle. Ordered by his mother to search for the fortune she is sure the old men made from robbery in their youth,the boy stumbles upon bags of money hidden in a barn.................. This rites of passage tale feels like a treatment of ""To kill a mocking bird"" as it might have been envisioned by a late era John Ford with perhaps James Stewart and John Wayne in mind.Not a perhaps rather goody-two-shoes Atticus Finch,but two tough,real men,flawed maybe,but recognisably flesh and blood beings.""Tell me how to be a man"" implores young Osment,a Fordian sentiment if ever I heard one. Mr Caine,far too often acting with one eye on his bank balance,is superb with an accent spot on for a man who has travelled the world before ending up in Texas.Mr Duval totally believable as the old but bold action man of the pair.

20,caspian1978,2nd-Hand Lions / 2nd-Rate Movie,6,21 December 2004,"Secondhand Lions is a good movie, but because of its PG rating and lack of quality storytelling with its direction and screenplay, Secondhand Lions is far from a great movie. The cast is terrific. This is one of very few films that is good for the entire family. Some scenes seemed rushed by the director, then again, half the film is geared toward the youth audience while the rest is mature. The real story that the audience is hoping for is the coming of age drama that the nephew has with his two uncles. While some of the movie is focused on this, the other half is somewhat wasted on the flashback, voice over narration, storytelling that one of the uncle has with his nephew. In some ways, too much talk and not enough action. It would have been nice if we saw more of the cartoon aspect of the movie in the first half instead of having it all at the very end.",Secondhand Lions
21,triple8,"moving, fun, sweetly poignant with such lovable characters",9,1 January 2007,"SPOILERS:I did not expect to like this that much at all but I did. I watched it mainly because a friend and I take turns watching movies the other recommends and this was one of her selections. Although I knew the basic plot I simply wouldn't have picked it as my type of thing. I was wrong alright. This movie was lovely. Everything about it is captivating.I won't get into talking about plot specifics but will say this movie is excellent at getting the audience involved in the movie. It's impossible not to adore the uncles almost from the beginning. You know a movie's good when you not only want to meet the characters, but feel sad that they are actually not real. These two uncles are unforgettable.(actually so is the boy and that adorable lion!) and though the movie starts slow it eventually envelops you in the stories and the adventures being talked about.My friend had told me there is a kind of ""Narnia"" quality about this movie and she is right. People who liked ""Chronicles Of Narnia""(a favorite of mine) will probably love this as well. It can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. It's not unreasonably long, it gets occasionally heavy but never in an unwatchable way, and the Movie has such deep sweetness, that schmaltz lovers better stay away! Seriously, those who don't like sugar sweetness to their films will likely hate this because Second Hand Lions oozes so much of that, it could start a sugar flood! Still, it's a great movie. Dark Edgy films are sometimes great but where would we be without meltingly sweet, heartwarming films such as this as well? This movie is touching and it's message is one of optimism and hope. I loved it and would strongly recommend it to anyone who feels like watching a captivatingly wholesome movie with a very big heart. My vote is 9 of 10.",Secondhand Lions
22,Sherazade,A Beautiful coming of age story!,10,11 March 2006,"Gosh! I love Haley Joel Osment, this boy is a diamond in the rough! He shines (as usual) in this wonderful story about two aging men with a legend looming over their heads. These two men happen to be his uncles, and are played effortlessly perfectly by Michael Caine (donning an American southern accent) and Robert Duvall. How Osment managed to hold his own opposite these two, we may never know. Nevermind the fact that he also had to handle the seamless eccentricity of his mother played by the wonderfully delightful Kiera Sedgwick! The story revolves around Osment's character, who is suddenly driven out to the countryside by his philandering mother and abandoned with uncles he never knew he had under the pretext of male bonding. But his mother had secretly told him that his uncles are worth millions and that his mission there is to search for where they've stashed the money. Not a stranger to his mother's antics, coupled with the startling revelation that is thrown upon him when he tries to contact her after she leaves him, only to find out that she is not where she said she would be. He abandons his supposed mission (not that he ever thought about truly taking it up anyways) and begins to bond with his uncles. Authentically bond with them.

They actually begin to live life again and in the course of all this, they begin to relate stories of their past adventures to him.

24,rosscinema,All too obvious coming of age story,3,1 December 2004,"With a cast like this in a film that desperately wants you to like it for all it's noble qualities I found this easy to dismiss mainly because the story here practically mashes your face into it's dripping sentiment. Story takes place in either the 1950's or early 60's where 14 year old Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is dumped by his mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) on a farm owned by his distant uncles while she goes off to either school or Nevada. Uncles Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall) are cantankerous old coots who sip iced tea on the porch and shoot at traveling salesman who continue to snoop around after hearing the rumors that they are hiding millions in riches.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Garth and Hub don't know how to take their shy nephew at first but they eventually warm to each other and Walter takes great delight in Garth's stories about Hub being in the French Foreign Legion and stealing a desert Princess named Jasmine. Walter doesn't know if the stories are true or not and he hears rumors that his uncles stole money from Al Capone but he still enjoys them immensely and comes to learn that it's not important if they're true just as long as you believe them.This film is directed by Tim McCanlies who after being known primarily as a writer is making his debut directing and he throws a lot of different things into the story that eventually floods the script. The script bashes you over the head with cute scenarios and the sentiment is piled on very thick and the symbolism with the old lion is just too obvious. One other thing sticks out like a sore thumb and it's the casting of Caine as a Texan which just doesn't work as his English accent is more evident than his attempt at a Texas drawl. This is the second film that Duvall and Caine have worked on together in about 25 years or so and the first was ""The Eagle Has Landed"" in 1977. This film strives to be both charming and sentimental but after the first 10 minutes the heavy handed script becomes painfully obvious and it loses it's appeal completely.",Secondhand Lions

28,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A true family-friendly film about the importance of authentic manhood.,10,26 May 2019,"Making a family-friendly film is perhaps one of the most difficult tasks in cinema. Not only does it have to appeal to children, but it also has to avoid plenty of material that might not be appropriate for younger audiences. If families can get a powerful life lesson out of it as well, all the better. While modern fare tends to resort to the crass and focuses on bathroom humor for laughs, there are those rare few films that manage to tell a tight story. With legitimate laughs and a heartfelt conclusion, Secondhand Lions (2003) is just such a movie.The two strengths that make this one of my favorite family-friendly films are its characters and its plot. All three of the main characters show some amount of significant character growth by the time the end credits roll. Besides, with acting talents like Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and Haley Joel Osment, you really can't miss here. In terms of plot, the pacing holds at a steady clip that drives the flashbacks and revelation of two lives lived to the fullest extent possible. On top of everything, this movie is relatable to boys and men of all ages.While there are moments that will make you laugh and others that are heartfelt and earned, the core of this movie deals with manhood. Even back in the timeframe of this movie, there was a distinct separation between the ""modern"" man and the values of the greatest generation. The comparison between the guys who think physical strength makes them men and the actual men who know that strength comes from character is a timeless lesson that is still relevant and will remain relevant for decades to come. Perhaps the rarity of these character-driven men has put society into the state it's in now.A true family-friendly film about the importance of authentic manhood, I give Secondhand Lions 5.0 stars out of 5.",Secondhand Lions
29,rainking_es,"Caine and Duvall (and that annoying kid), in sort of a Disney story",6,19 August 2004,"Caine and Duvall, and sort of a Disney storySecondhand Lions is just a good movie for the kids to watch on a Saturday afternoon. Two grumpy old men have two take care of a young boy whose mother's a little bit flirtatious. The story is quite predictable, and there're hundred's of movies with the same plot. Anyway, it's good directed, and we got Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, who have demonstrated their talent through dozens of movies. In fact it's because of them that I watched this picture. And It didn't disappoint me because I didn't expect nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a pleasure to watch this two giants together (I think this is the first time they ran into the same movie). As for Haley Joel, I can't stand that kid. He did a good job in Sixth Sense, but that's all. I can't stand his voice, nor his expression (ALWAYS the same).",Secondhand Lions
30,Atreyu_II,Better than you might expect,7,8 August 2007,"This is a movie with a story that is simple, predictable and nothing special. Not to mention that its title is completely cheesy and not attractive at all.Without being a great movie, once you get to see ""Secondhand Lions"", you realize that it is better than you might think. It's an okay movie in my humble opinion and it has some good surprises too. In general, it's a movie that one can watch relaxed, without much bad surprises and no violence or profanity.This movie meant a brief return of the great Haley Joel Osment, no longer as a child but as a teenager. He looks pretty much the same, but more grown up now and with a changed voice. Besides, this time he plays a more comical role (different from his usual dramatic roles). But I personally rather him in dramatic roles and movies.""Secondhand Lions"" isn't as good as «the fabulous 4 Haley's movies» (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Pay It Forward"", ""Edges of the Lord"" and ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"").I love Haley's apprehensive facial expressions in ""Secondhand Lions"". They're just so comical! For example, see the fear on his face when the farm's animals go straight to him. Or even the terror on his face because of his two eccentric uncles's (Hub and Garth) strange attitudes. And all of this without forgetting the dramatic side, which Haley is well known for.By the way, I like those stories about Africa told by uncle Garth. They're very interesting and they show us some wonderful sceneries and backgrounds. Like Walter says, those are good stories. Those stories about young Hub and young Garth in Africa are a good surprise about this movie.It is also funny that Walter names his lioness Jasmine. Come to think of it, it isn't a bad name for a lioness. I'll second what Walter said.Walter (the character played by Haley Joel Osment) is very much like the character Chuck Nordstadt (played by Nick Stahl) from ""The Man Without a Face"". They have lots of similarities: both of them are shy, suspicious, apprehensive and somehow lonely; they're both around the same age; they are physically similar (including the hair style and face); their facial expressions are incredibly similar and they both judge very apprehensively the persons they meet during the whole movie at first, but end up developing a great friendship that will last forever.Overall, a reasonable movie. Nothing super, but worth a try at least for the fact that it isn't as a bad as you might think.",Secondhand Lions
31,Ben_Cheshire,The casting of Haley Joel was a nail in the coffin of a movie which otherwise would have lived forever.,1,18 July 2004,"The only possible argument I would believe for why Haley Joel doesn't spoil this picture with his cue-cards acting is that because he's so blank and robotic, the viewer is able to imprint their own impressions on the kid, and put themselves in his place.But I don't buy into those explanations. I believe a filmmaker should not rely on us to make their movie good. Do the work yourself. I believe Haley Joel actually prevents us from being able to associate with him or put ourselves in his place, because he looks like a child star trying to extend himself into his teens. His career is in his eyes, not his character.I realised the reason child stars can never be good adult actors. its because in general, to be a good actor you need life experience to use in your acting, a store of emotional experience to draw on to enact experiences foreign to you. Child stars just have not had the time to garner that life experience, so their emotional store is depleted, if not totally bankrupt. The thing which is tragic about Haley Joel has nothing to do with his inability to act, its just damn terrible in a social sense - as in, the poor kid! Instead of a childhood, he's been hanging around movie lots. So the sadly ironic thing is that he's just shown to the world in this movie that he has nothing in common with a regular kid. He has no idea how they act!So the rest of this film has built up this elaborate fantasy world, this endearing experience for this central character, but when we look into Haley Joel's eyes, we see no reflection of this. Its as if he doesn't even know what the movie's about.And Bobby Duvall and Michael Caine do such a terrific job, and the screenplay is just such a magnificent work of imagination and humanity... it almost makes me cry to think of what a tragedy it is that the kid would have preferred to be watching himself on an awards night, or in a press conference, instead of telling us a story with his eyes.7/10. It may have become one of my favourite movies, but this material was just above Haley Joel's abilities. His repertoire clearly only extends to weird kids who talk like robots (The Sixth Sense, Pay it Forward) or actual robots (AI).",Secondhand Lions
32,roedyg,Offbeat Family Movie,7,27 March 2006,"The ingredients for this family movie are impeccable: Haley Joel Osment (the boy in Artificial Intelligence), Michael Caine, Robert Duval, a lion, a giraffe, a pig, an huge pile of money, an Arabian princess and a pack of sympathetic dogs.It is a movie unlike any other you have ever seen. It works with flashbacks, but you never know to what extent the flashbacks are just tall tales, with adventure out of Saturday serials of yesteryear.It plays with themes around the meaning of life, something too serious for most movies to tackle. It explores belief, faith and suicide without being heavy handed.The cantankerous uncles are blunt. One said to the young boy whom has been abandoned by him Mom that it is just too bad some people get rotten parents. Young Walter then decides to get on with his life despite that setback.Even though it is obviously a contrived and silly situation, it often bothered me when Osment's character behaved in sucky ways unlike any boy I ever knew. It was just too corny.The uncles are no angels. They buy a lion just so that they can shoot it. They shoot anything that moves which provides perhaps too much of the movie's humour.Osment's forte is appearing vulnerable so you want desperately to take care of him or see that someone does. He does that well in this movie, but nowhere near to the extent he plucked the heartstrings in Artificial Intelligence.",Secondhand Lions
33,movieguy1021,Secondhand Lions: 6/10,6,23 September 2003,"If Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star was released in five years or so, you can bet that Haley Joel Osment would have had a cameo, along with other child stars. He begun by acting in such films as Forrest Gump and peaked in 1999 starring in The Sixth Sense. After his Oscar nomination (robbed by Michael Caine, who stars along with Osment here in Secondhand Lions) he started to go downhill, from Pay it Forward and then hitting bottom by voicing the main character in The Country Bears and doing voices in movies that should have gone direct-to-video like The Jungle Book 2. And here he is in Secondhand Lions, doing whatever it takes to scrounge whatever he has left of his dignity and play it straight.I was hesitant to into Secondhand Lions, due to the less-than-positive reviews it had been getting, and all of the mud that had been flung at Osment's acting. However, I sucked it up and bought a ticket for it. What I got was low on plot and high on sap, with some good laughs and bad editing thrown into the mix. What you could consider plot goes like this: Walter (Osment) is a boy of young teens (you can tell by the way his voice cracks more than Peter Brady in that episode of The Brady Bunch) dropped off at his eccentric uncles' house by his mother (Kyra Sedgwick). Walter is a shy, soft-spoken kid who now lives with his two over-the-top great-uncles Hub (Robert Duvall) and Garth (Caine), whose idea of a good time is to shoot at traveling salesmen. What follows is a seemingly endless coming-of-age story.Secondhand Lions really doesn't know what it wants to be. At times that can benefit a movie, but here it makes the movie too uneven. There could be an important, meaningful scene, followed by mayhem and would-be hilarity. We were just getting over the force-fed sap from the previous scene, and now we are supposed to be enticed into the fun of the next. As I was walking out of the movie, I heard a theater employee say, `That could so not happen.' While it's not supposed to, I just found the whole movie a little over-the-top.Speaking of over-the-top, that's exactly what Caine and Duvall are, and they seem to enjoy it. They are the best part of the movie, plain and simple. They, unlike Osment, seem to understand that this is not a very serious movie, and just ham it up as much as they can. It makes a great contrast to Osment, who almost plays as a fish out of water. Osment wants to continue to be a `serious' actor, so he tries to be as serious and un-silly as he can be, which takes away some of the movie. Although he isn't wooden, as other people say, he isn't up to par with Caine and Duvall's wonderful performances.On the other side of the spectrum, what comedy was there (just not enough to be considered a `comedy'; it was more of a `light-hearted drama) was very funny. Mind you, it isn't A Mighty Wind funny, but for what it was it was quite humorous. If you want to go see Secondhand Lions, see it for the great performances by Duvall and Caine.My rating: 6/10Rated PG for thematic material, language and action violence.",Secondhand Lions

When Haley Joel Osment's Mother drops him off to stay for a while with two old curmudgeons, a perceptive viewer can probably guess what happens next--but that knowledge doesn't detract from the fun-it's like a great fairy tale that you want to have told to you again, a sentimental rural fable rich with the kind of things kids (and many adults) like--lions that can be tamed, monoplanes that can be built, and worthwhile lessons that can be learned. Nobody farts, nobody says the ""f"" word, and nobody drops their pants--it's actually funny because its humor springs from the considerable well-honed talents of acting treasures Michael Caine and Robert Duvall and from a well-written kid's story--with adults welcome to come along for the ride.",Secondhand Lions

But while he's there he slowly starts to form a bond with them, both teaching them things and learning things from them. As the film progresses Garth tells Walter the long story how he and Hub became rich. The movie is kind of a tearjerker, and is very sappy, sometimes unbearably sappy.

53,abrafocus,"The movie was great, but I object to the language",7,2 May 2006,"I did enjoy this movie when I first watched it. The story was excellent, and Haley Joel Osment's role as Walter was done very well. Michael Caine and Robert Duvall did very well, too.But I object to one thing: the language. The foul language that Caine and Duvall use. I do not mind them using clean language, but to use the language as often as they did was very annoying.The flashback scenes were done well, and though I cannot remember any other actor in the movie, I must say that it is a good story.**Spoilers begin here** Walter is a shy boy, and is sent by his very irresponsible mother to stay with his two great-uncles for the summer, who appear at first to object the boy's presence. But soon, they start talking, and before you know it, Garth tells Walter amazing stories about himself and Hub when they were younger.They eventually begin to plant a garden, and many other things happen that I can't say without spoiling it. But I'll say that Walter's mother shows up later to take Walter away, bringing with her a very mean and vicious man, and they claim that Garth and Hub are robbers and murderers. But May, Walter's mother, had lied to Walter so many times, he didn't know who to believe. But eventually, he makes the farm his permanent home.It could have received at least a 9 from me if it weren't for all the language, but it loses that many points for it.My Score: 7/10.",Secondhand Lions
54,shawnmikedryer,Great family fun,9,6 January 2021,"Walter is not unlike every other 13 year old yet for his age he already faced many hardships for his age. Without any sort of father figure in the picture and what one would classify as a single mom with floozy tendencies and a taste in distasteful men. Thus all this has shown to be no sort of figure to look up to for Walter, hindering what a boy his age should know by now. On yet another excursion with a new husband Walter's mother decides to drop the boy off at her two Uncles' farm in some middle of nowhere countryside farm home. Walter has never met his Great Uncle's and from what few stories his mother told of them, they appear to be shrouded in mystery. As the story goes Hub and Garth evidentially disappeared for some time overseas in their youth's and now may or may not be sitting on a secret stash of presumably stolen cash and gold riches. Secretly Walter's mother covets a path to scheming her dirty hands on the mysterious stockpile of wealth. Though the two Uncle's grasp on uncertainty as to whether or not Walter can garnish some acceptance from them, he grows on them slowly but surely as Walter does appear to be a very bright young man. Soon they begin to share all the fantastic journeys they had in those years they had been misplaced in time. Walter now has the knowledge, self awareness, and self motivation to take charge of his life once and for all, his mother be damned.This is a film that is certainly a staple of my childhood as over the years be it in my own home or a perfectly selected educationally built in school movie I've probably viewed this at least a dozen times. It honestly is such a deeply structured story that it can tend to illuminate differently every time i watch it garnishing more insight on the overall message in this film.

Some (most) of the action scenes are a bit cartoonish but that only adds to its delightfulness. But maybe the best thing about this movie is it's endings. You get TWO great endings.

56,nmholland,A Great Coming-To-Age Film With A Superb Story to Tell,8,17 May 2016,"Secondhand Lions is directed by Tim McCanlies and stars Haley Joel Osment as Walter, a boy living in the 1950's with a mom that is a very irresponsible parent. When his mother decides that she's going to college, which Walter is suspicious of being dishonest, she drops him off at his two great uncles' house in Texas. He's never met these uncles, but, while living with them, will learn and experience many different things about life and being a man.I was raised on Secondhand Lions. I remember watching this movie for the first time as a five year old with my grandmother. I recently rewatched it, and it isn't' the perfect film I remembered it to be, however still being an amazing story. The lessons that Walter learns while living with his uncles are very coming-to-age worthy, and fit perfectly well with the theme of this movie, that being that believing in specific things, true or not, is necessary to live a happy life.The best thing Secondhand Lions seems to offer is the incredible acting talent delivered by each and every actor credited. Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, two legendary actors cast as uncles Hub and Garth, both do amazing as the characters they're cast for, however different they may be from each other. Hub likes to fight, and give ""becoming a man"" speeches to teenage ""punks"" that he beats up, while Garth likes to garden and tell tales of the past, however accurate they may be. Both of these actors do great in their roles, and play great parenting figures for young Walter, played excellently by the mid-adolescent Haley Joel Osment.The direction is nothing to clap for, but it isn't bad, either. Secondhand Lions is the second film directed by Tim McCanlies, after Dancer, Texas Pop. 81 (1998), and, while his abilities have improved, he could still use a bit more practice. Although the action scenes aren't abundant, they are filmed well, and deserve recognition. Other than that, however, most of the rest of the movie is just exposition or ""talking"" scenes. Although said scenes are entertaining, the direction is pretty usual, and doesn't exactly add anything particular to the film.The pacing isn't the greatest either. Throughout almost the entire film, Uncle Garth is periodically telling Walter about his and Hub's past together. However, the spacing of these flashback scenes is actually pretty substandard. Within thirty minutes, twenty of it will have been dedicated to the flashbacks, and then we see no flashbacks for another half hour. The film also takes place in a single summer, and a lot of the film will focus on a particular day, and then jump forward in time without explanation. The pacing of the film is collectively poor, and could've been improved upon.The last thing I'll mention is unfortunately a negative, but not a huge one. There are a couple characters that seem somewhat unnecessary, and are spontaneously thrown into the plot for a small purpose, or no purpose at all, and then are abandoned by the script. This stole attention from the story's true intention, which is to tell a great story. If some of these characters were removed, or served a greater purpose, then this complaint would be put to rest very quickly.In conclusion, Secondhand Lions is actually a really good film, there's just a few smaller aspects of it that are sub-par. If the filmmakers would've tweaked a couple things, Secondhand Lions would be one of the greatest coming-to-age films ever made. However, I still would recommend this film almost anybody, because it is an enjoyable time.",Secondhand Lions

59,john32935,Very enjoyable,8,23 January 2015,"A well-crafted, coming-of-age story that reflects upon the importance of belief in the face of cynicism which simultaneously reflects upon the fear of obsolescence encountered by elders. The 3 lead actors Robert Duval, Michael Caine and Haley Joel Osment each bring an inherent likability to their characters that raises what could otherwise be a slightly saccharin script to a perfect level of sweetness without going overboard. And Kyra Sedgewick brings such charm and energy to an otherwise unlikable role that one can almost accept her and her behavior.The flashbacks revelations are intentionally cartoonish so that the audience is let to question the accuracy of their basis just as Mr. Osment's character does. It is only when facts are later exposed in the film that the question is resolved for Mr. Osment and the audience.This film shows once again that Hollywood can make great character-based films. I am not sure how this one slipped under my radar for so long.",Secondhand Lions
60,Juni78ukr,"A perfect piece of the film-making. Well, if you want almost perfect.",10,28 May 2004,"Looking at my previous comments after re-watching Secondhand Lions on DVD with original sound I realized that those comments have to be revised. When I watched this movie for the first time I considered it as a pretty good movie but I didn't realize how good it was. Now my opinion is that Tim McCanlies created a perfect masterpiece, one of the very best movies of the year. I guess too many people might say that word perfect is too much but I believe that Secondhand Lions deserves that, though even in the greatest masterpieces it is possible to find a room for some improving.By any means Secondhand Lions is never a tale about two crazy old guys and a shy young boy who comes to live with them. Tim McCanlies's work is beyond such primitive views and approaches. Amazing and at the same time very simple his screenplay and outstanding direction, every shot in the movie, every character and actors, who perfectly played them created a bright picture of our flawed world and faith in shattering ideals and hopes. Secondhand Lions is an incredibly bright and heartwarming tale of discovery, learning and hope.""Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most. That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that power and money, money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil"". This phrase of Robert Duvalle's character is the center of the movie and it is very important that these are words just of an old man, who definitely saw a lot in his life and there is no strong philosophy or other references here. Short Hub's words are very simple and very convincing and it's possible also to find in them a slight reproach to our generation, poisoned by lying and corrupted politics, mass culture when everything is commercialized and filled with publicity and advertising. If in this world there is something worth to believe I prefer this way to any other. Personally I found much more than expected relations with other Osment's undeservedly overlooked movie Pay It Forward. However, that's not for the first time when I'm disgusted at so many respectable critics around the world for their position. It seems that for them praising such simple and heartfelt movie (even if it really deserves that) is like committing in their own incompetence. Fortunately I have noticed also that most of less prejudiced writers wrote well-deserved positive reviews to Secondhand Lions. I've seen lots of movies this year but it's very hard to find another one than unite such strong characters with superb acting. Both Caine and Duvalle have great performances as two brothers, Hub and Garth. Throughout the movie we see their characters in different scenes from complete calmness to strong emotions, which we hardly could expect from them, and the actors perfectly created these two complicated characters. But the fact is that the soul of the movie is Walter and Haley Joel Osment who had one of the best of his performances playing him. In the beginning of the movie Walter is a twelve year boy who definitely hasn't seen a good thing in his life for a while and during next 90 minutes we can see him in different situations and what is the most important that Haley amazingly transmitted to us all strong emotions and feelings of this character. His performance is full of life and it looks like he lives the same life as his character for a while and he is never overacting playing Walter.Also there is no point to understate excellent Tim McCanlies's directing. He brought to us lots of very memorable scenes and dialogs and carefully developed complicated characters. There were numerous opportunities to ruin any scene or whole movie or makes it over-sentimental but in Secondhand Lions the director put everything on its proper place and even if I would have an opportunity to make changes into the movie I wouldn't change a thing. I don't expect that with such pitiful marketing this excellent movie can reach large audience which it really deserves but if you get any opportunity to check this movie out just do that because even the most cynical ones might find lots of good things in Secondhand Lions.",Secondhand Lions
61,rbsjrx,A(nother) review of two films,10,20 August 2008,"This review is of both ""Secondhand Lions"" and ""Big Fish"". Both films share common themes, but develop them in different ways. Although both have been out long enough to be seen on TV and DVD, still this review does contain minor spoilers for both.Both films deal with boys growing into manhood with male parent figures who are notable for telling tall tales. Both are feel good movies with bittersweet endings where the children have grown up and the parents die at the end. But the devil is in the details and despite such similar plot synopses, these films could hardly be more different.In ""Secondhand Lions"", which I consider to be the superior film of the two, the father figures are two uncles of the protagonist with a secret related to their seemingly endless supply of money. In ""Big Fish"", the father figure is the biological father of the protagonist.The essential difference in the two is honesty. In ""Big Fish"", the tall tales are just that - stories with a grain of truth (which is revealed at the end), but which the dad exaggerates into fantastic lies. The dad, a big-mouthed salesman, spouts his tales as naturally as breathing - and just about as often. In ""Secondhand Lions"", the uncles are quite taciturn and only tell their stories to the boy after being prodded, and then over a period of time. Not surprisingly, by the end of the film, you learn that the tales were essentially all true.""Secondhand Lions"" has a lot of heart and is based on characters you can believe in and admire. ""Big Fish"" is nothing more than a film which preaches tolerance of lies if they make someone feel good.The performances in both films are first-rate, but ""Big Fish"" is handicapped by the fact that it is ultimately a fantasy. The cast of ""Big Fish"" also lacks the depth of talent on display in ""Secondhand Lions"". While ""Big Fish"" contains some standout performances, ""Secondhand Lions"" features Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, Halley Joel Osment, and Kyra Sedgwick at the top of their games. I really liked all the principle characters in ""Secondhand Lions"", but the characters in ""Big Fish"" were either not particularly likable or were fantasy caricatures so it was hard to feel much of anything for them.I own both DVDs and enjoy both films from time to time, but ""Secondhand Lions"" is a personal favorite. I watch it about three times as often as ""Big Fish"".",Secondhand Lions
62,johnmschofield,A surprisingly good film,9,31 October 2009,I came across this film purely by accident earlier this year and I am thankful that I did because it is a very good film which deserves a lot more attention. It is a deep insightful presentation which touches on a lot of issues which should always bother responsible adults and after all it is always the job of the adults to guide the children to make sure that they are as well prepared for the big bad old world as possible. These issues are dealt with in a gentle matter of fact way perhaps in an unconventional way but in this particular case it is very effective. It is also very entertaining and all of the parts of the film come together and the end result is good on the eye and a healthy work out for the emotions. This is another one of those films which for reasons I am not aware of probably didn't get the advanced publicity and therefore seems to have been put on the shelf which is a great shame but maybe if enough people see how good this film is that could change. For me it is a solid piece of work which does not appear diluted after repeated viewings therefore I would recommend anybody watch it. Please give it your full attention and as far as I am concerned it will not disappoint.,Secondhand Lions

But when their nephew(Osment) whom they have never met get thrown at their doorstep by his irresponsible mother, they soon discover sides of themselves either long forgotten or never experienced. I loved Duvall's performance simply because his character had more mystique and flair than Caine's character. But in contrast to each other it plays out wonderfully humorous. I actually wouldn't mind a prequel of this film based on the story's spent in the foreign legion and numerous wars. And of course Emmanuelle Vaugier's role however short is one of the things i will remember most about this film in a visual context, A stunningly beautiful actress with great acting skills.

64,pwoods1,Gentle yet more substantial than a first viewing offers,7,25 September 2004,"This is a very gentle film - not as gripping as Big Fish but in a similar genre - which is worth a second look and therefore a reappraisal.Ostensibly a coming-of-age film, I saw it more as an abandoned child's (surely Walter is such) search for belonging: a search for affirmation that life is more than being cast-off as worthless by the person she/he loves, and therefore worth living. At one point Walter indicates that he is sick of being lied to by his mother, Mae, apparently always dumping him for the ""new boyfriend"" in her life. And thus we come to the crux of the movie.""Secondhand Lions"" refers as much to the curmudgeonly uncles, Garth and Hub, (eccentric characters wonderfully understated/underplayed by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) as it does to the ""used"" lion that the brothers purchase. Walter first becomes fascinated by Garth's fantastical tales of Africa, but when Garth ""misremembers"" the rescue of Jasmine, the only love of his brother's life, Walter starts to question the truth behind their past. Indeed, having witnessed Hub's (apparent) sleepwalking, Walter doubts the sanity of his uncles.Earlier, however, on arrival at their decaying home, the child has discovered a well-traveled cabin trunk; and, upon opening it, discovers sand covering a portrait of whom he later learns is Jasmine - the love of Hub's life. Later, in a show of bravado when he names the ageing ""secondhand"" lion ""Jasmine"", the threads of Hub's story come together and, intriguingly enough, when Walter appears to be leaving, it is Hub whom he fiercely hugs. In a sense, Hub's loss of Jasmine mirrors his own emptiness.OK. It's gentle, but I offer that the constant (I would argue not intrusive) symbolism and allegories work. Walter exposes a pointless existence in as much as the brothers are waiting to die - and gives them a reason to live. And, of course, they live beyond his and their wildest dreams. But those dreams are shown, finally, as truth. The denouement, twee as it might seem, fits the script. The treasure/money which Walter's mother Mae told him to seek becomes the love/relationship which he needed.(By the way, it's OK to cry. Big boys do that too. I did.)",Secondhand Lions

I'm not a big fan of Michael Caine but I have to admit that he was perfect in this movie, low-key and believable as a Texan.Overall I liked this movie. It was warm without being sappy, funny without resorting to cheap shots, and intelligent enough that adults could appreciate it as well as kids, but there were so many questions left unanswered that I was distracted more often than not.Here are two men who have been in the French Foreign Legion for the last 40 years, traveling all over the world, amassing a fortune and experiencing things that regular people can't even start to imagine, and then they pick this tiny Texas town to retire to? Why? How did all these money-grubbing distant relatives find the uncles? I doubt Garth and Hub kept in touch with anyone over the past 40 years and once they came back they stayed to themselves, so how would these relatives even know who they were, much less that they had returned and where they were living? If they just came back why is everything in the house covered with dust? Was this their childhood home? A house they bought while they were away? Why don't they have a phone? We don't know.Another thing is that when Walter finds the stash of money it looks like it's been there for years, thrown into the hole haphazardly, which makes no sense, but then again it doesn't make any sense at all that they would have been carrying all those piles and piles of cash around with them for the past 40 years, or even that they still have the entire amount given to them by the Sheik all those years ago.I loved the garden scene, where they think they've planted beets and lettuce but all they've planted is corn, and I loved the matching farmer outfits they all wore because ""that's what people wear when they do gardening."" I didn't like that they didn't go into more detail about Jasmine; Hub just said she and a baby died in childbirth and that was it. For him to still be looking for her in his dreams so many years later there should have been more to the story, and why did he always go to the lake to look for her? Why did Walter grow up to be a cartoonist? There was no indication that he liked to draw or that he had any talent for it. With the way he cared about the lioness I would've assumed that he would grow up to work with animals or that he too would run off to travel the world seeking adventure, the way his beloved uncles did.There were so many questions raised that were left unexplained that it sort of ruined the story for me, but all in all it was a nice way to spend a couple of hours.",Secondhand Lions

70,Gavno,And Now For Something Completely Different...,9,5 April 2004,"For a VERY long time I've been disgusted with most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood...  too many movies with huge budgets and absolutely NO imagination or talent involved. Lately tho, the Hollywood system has slipped a bit, and a few films by SMART people working with nonformula scripts have been falling through the cracks. And they're a refreshing breeze for those of us that don't bother with ""One Weekend Wonders"" that generate monster box office receipts for two or three weeks, that involve the latest orgasm generator ""stars"" and a ton of explosives and guns...   just to sink into oblivion afterwards, like TITANIC or PEARL HARBOR.The LAST intelligent movie I saw was A MIGHTY WIND. Right on it's heels, we get SECONDHAND LIONS.I've been a Robert Duval fan for a LONG time...  there's more than a little bit of Sonny from THE APOSTLE, and a taste of Colonel ""Bull"" Meecham from THE GREAT SANTINI thrown into the character of Hub. He's done a Tour De Force job with the performance. WONDERFUL!!!The biggest surprise in all of this tho was Michael Caine's take on playing a Texas redneck! It's hard to imagine that the impeccably English Spitfire squadron commander from BATTLE OF BRITAIN could pull off a crusty, aging Texan, but he DOES it beautifully. He even gets the accent down quite well!This is a film that's a TON of fun from beginning to end. IMHO it's destined to become a classic, very much like Jean Sheppard's A CHRISTMAS STORY.It's worth the trip. Pick it up, and you won't be sorry.

The flashbacks were hilarious because as we age, the things we did before become more dramatic and are further enhanced. No one thinks about their past in terms of mediocrity, and this was brought out in the flashback scenes. Osment was a superb cast in this movie because of his unchanging facial expression. He has been burnt out with lies and his mother's constant searching for a husband only to find another loser.His comment to his mother said it all. Here was a kid who had met a lot of ""uncles"", so here were two more uncles that he was being pawned off on.Robert Duvall and Michael Caine are the only two actors that come to mind who could pull this off. I plan to add this to my collection and would highly recommend it to anyone who has a ever daydreamed about far off places or dares to dream about what might have been.Hollywood has gone off the deep end in trying to project a certain political ideology and this has hurt the overall film industry.

It seems that like Haley Joel Osmont's character I myself love his Uncle Garth's stories so much I have to hear them again...and again...and again! The movie focuses on Walter, the son of an irresponsible mother who in a sordid lie leaves him with his two aging bachelor uncles (Caine and Duvall in exceptional performances) for the summer while she leaves for Court Reporting School. Discovering this to be just another of her lies Walter find himself at first not liking his situation, that is until he sees the charm and wonder of his uncles and their magical lives in a secluded Texas farm house.Listening to his Uncle Garth (Caine) Walter realizes there's so much more to them than he once believed, especially his Uncle Hub (Duvall) and discovers that sometimes to be a man you just have to believe in something, whether it could be true or not.Full of laughs, great moments and more this movie honestly kept me smiling through the WHOLE thing. I loved every minute of it and yes, it will one day be a classic. The acting is good, the story is great and the movie overall is one of the best ever made in recent years. Give it a shot if you haven't already, its definitely worth a look!",Secondhand Lions
76,Petie3-2,NOT AI,10,14 September 2003,"HJO is the centerpiece of the film, and is in nearly every scene.  He is supposed to be a 'weenie' without a male role model and finds these two when his worthless mom leaves him with two distant great-uncles with a past. What a past.  The whole film involves what the past is and whether or not it is real. The plot involves whether HJO believes it is real, and whether or not it matters whether it is real.  The relationships are what matters, and this picture reveals that truth. Beautifully done, no flat spots, entertaining throughout and a good 9/10.",Secondhand Lions

The acting from the three leads is superb, simple, elegant and very very moving, funny and eloquent in all the right places. It's a shame Hollywod seems to want to appease the 'shoot em up brigade' and goes more for the 'guts and glory films' of late, but Secondhand Lions is one of the best films, if not the best film of it's time - it is wonderful. So a huge thank you to the writers, the directors, the actors and everyone else connected with it; you should all be very proud.This review also appears on the review pages for Secondhand Lions on Amazon.co.uk",Secondhand Lions

83,Frogfisher,Wonderful and heartwarming film,9,8 May 2009,"The Plot: The boy, Walther(Osment), is left with his old eccentric and rich uncles(Duval and Caine) while his lying mother (Sedgewick) goes off for Las Vegas with her new boyfriend. On the uncle's farm he starts to learn about their eccentricities and why they left America for 40 years and finally came back. While he gets this story he experience the brothers crazy ideas and how they deal with old age. Walther has to deal with what he believes being stuck between the outrageous stories of the uncles past and his mothers lies.The review: This movie is a wonderful movie for a Sunday afternoon with the family or girlfriend or anyone. It isn't the greatest work of art or a truly deep movie... but it doesn't really want to. The plot is easily explainable and not very original. But that doesn't matter, because it is the best version of the old men telling fairy tales about a grand adventurous past in far off countries. It does it with a glimpse in the eye and a sense of humour that is both warm, intelligent and suitable for the story, it doesn't become a comedy for the sake of comedy. And it touches softly on a range of themes, and touches the subject of truth heavily. With the central story line being a mothers dishonesty and the son's lack of trust, with the son spending time with two old men who tells outrageous stories from Europe and Africa. The main comedy elements is presented through the two old men's eccentric ideas as fishing with guns, skeet shooting, lion hunting and building and flying a plane. Osment is solid as he was at that age. For me the real enjoyment was Duval and Caine as the brothers. Their chemistry is right for brothers and they play the old men roles good. Caine with his biting sarcasm and Duval's macho strength. They are great! I would see this one again... and show it to others... it made me feel good... and I loved the end! What a way to go! 9/10",Secondhand Lions

I went to this movie with my family and my parents with ages of 10, 13, 14, 37, 44, 71, and 72 years.  We all really liked this film.  In discussing it after the film there were parts of it that all of us liked and then there were parts that the various age viewer seemed to focus on more than other ages. The two teens discussed seeing it with friends at school who thought it was ""just a movie about a couple of old men.""  I was impressed that my daughters got what this movie was about and explained it to their peers.  (Not an easy thing to do- that is be a teen explaining why you liked a movie about 2 old men.) My parents obviously like the two old men and their take on life. My wife and I found it quite entertaining.  It is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. Duval, Caine and Osment are all very good at their craft and turn in an excellent performance! I will admit to hoping that my kids would see the movie and get an appreciation for where they are in their life in comparison to where the Walter character was in the film.  I think it may have made them look at their grandparents and their parents in a different light. Go see it with your kids and if the grandparents are available go with them too!",Secondhand Lions

Robert Duvall and Michael Caine are terrific, the story is very good, the flashbacks are also very good. I saw this movie several years after it had come out on a recommendation, and now I recommend it to everyone. It has a special magic. Animal actors are present throughout, and some are important parts of the plot. The animals perform well, and are a delight to see. The movie is funny and poignant. The coming of the boy into the lives of the old curmudgons changes their lives and the boy's, but it's told in a subtle manner. I like the movie, and recommend it to everybody.",Secondhand Lions

87,kdladage,Beautiful and wonderfully written,8,10 June 2005,"There was a time in the history of film that movies were made to tell stories that were like the old oral traditions -- where the literal truth of the story was not the important thing. The important thing was the truth that was contained within the messages and lessons that were being told at the same time.This movie is a hail back to the grand old days of true storytelling.There have been a few of the these films in recent times -- and Osment has managed to be in two of them: Secondhand Lions and AI. And unfortunately, both of these films suffer from the same failing: they managed to keep going about 5-15 minutes after the story should have ended.In this tale, we have two wonderful old men (Caine and Duval) that simply want to be left alone. These are Walter's (Osment) uncles. He is dumped with them by his tramp of a mother in her pathetic attempt to find out where the old men have hidden all of the money they supposedly have. In the end, Osment turns out to be exactly what the two old guys need, and they turn out to be exactly the sort of people to teach this young man what it is to be cared for, and to be a man -- all while the Uncles tell Walter the extraordinary tale of their trips through Europe and Africa as a part of the French Foreign Legion.Near the end of the film, there is a scene where Walter (now grown up) is reading the Will that his Uncles left behind. And here is where the film should have ended. There is a level of absoluteness that comes with the ending that, in my opinion, erodes the message of the film.As Hub (Duval) says ""It doesn't matter what's true. Something doesn't have to be true for you to believe in it.""",Secondhand Lions

Something was happening or another movie overshadowed it, but I know it was NOT the movie. This movie lacked the cheesy material most family movies have. It was brilliantly directed and acted. I loved watching the relationship between the uncles (Caine and Duvall) and the little boy (Haley Joel) emerge and grow deeper. The movie was a twist on other similar ""kid meets distant relative, instant hatred, eventual love and respect"" storylines, but I'll tell you what, this one was one of a kind anyway. So many things made it so. The airplane, the secret love, the truth unfolded a little at a time, and it all came together to create people that you just had to love.I'd watch it again over and over if the girls wanted to. If you just want a change of pace go get it and rent it for you and your children. You won't be disappointed. A nice, refreshing movie overall.",Secondhand Lions
90,mgarland,Secondhand tripe: 4/10,4,14 March 2004,"I had such high hopes for this movie, and then it turns out to be one lame joke after another with some pretty lame acting thrown in for good measure. Although there were a couple of pretty funny moments in the movie, for the most part Caine and Duvall seemed to be forcing the majority of the ""comedy"". There were numerous times where the two old guys would deliver some lines and everyone would pause like they were giving the audience time to laugh. That's not the way to do comedy, it should flow. Therefore, because I wasn't laughing, I found myself frequently waiting for things to start up again.Too sappy and too syrupy sweet, it's a cute movie, but that's about all. Definitely not a renter or a buyer, wait for it to come out on cable.",Secondhand Lions

I love Duvall and I love Osmont and I really liked Cain so despite the weird tittle I decided to give it a go without really knowing what to expect from him. Will what can I tell you? I was cracking up through all of it and actually was touched by the softer scenes too. Cain and Duvall are great as the old geezers but I was really impressed once again with Haley's acting. I recommended it instantly to my older sister, we have pretty similar tastes, and she and her husband also loved it at all the humor. It reminds me a bit of the Princess Bride for it's a story within a story where one of the Uncle's start telling the kid about what he and his brother did when he was younger, getting shanghaied and fighting in Africa, one of them falling in love. It has everything from lions, humorous bar fights and even Shieks and wonderful heartwarming moments with great writing. The scene at the river with Duvall and Haley especially touched me. It's a great family movie that the whole family will enjoy. I was amazed with how much I ended up loving it. It's a treasure and a rare gem among modern day family movies.",Secondhand Lions
93,bljk_15,Great Movie!,8,7 July 2005,"This movie is a good one I like the action, drama and comedy that it carries. Micheal Caine, Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment are great together.I have to say that I would really hate to be in Walter's (Osment) position.I mean having a LIAR for a MOTHER.It's like she does not even care about her son. His life pretty much blows, big time. Yet, all that changes when he goes to see his great-uncles. I have to say it's pretty weird how they live, and plus they secretly have millions of dollars hidden away. Rumor has it saying that they robbed all that from banks 30 years ago, and shot and killed lots of people. But all that is not true. During that time they first traveled to Europe for a little trip from home. And later they end in Africa. Fighting a war, battling and evil shiek and one of them becoming lucky to find love for a Princess! Anyway I don't want to spoil it you but, this really is a good film. I recommend it. There's alittle bit of language but it's not bad. Mostly it's just damn and hell. Nothing else really.",Secondhand Lions
94,Kronos-8,Can't recommend this one,4,7 January 2007,"Big fan of Duvall, Caine, Sedgewick. Don't mind sentimental tales. But even sentimental tales have to hand together. This one, sorry, doesn't. So many leaps and plot holes that it's impossible to ignore them. And while I hate to be too critical, Haley Joel Osment is absolutely horrible. If ever you wanted a kid to be eaten by a lion, secondhand or not, it's him in this movie. The transition between cranky old great uncles to doting father-figures occurs almost instantly and without explanation. The viewer is asked to accept far more on faith than even a movie about faith should ask. And to be constantly beaten by the soundtrack into FEELING SOMETHING is mostly unbearable. To all of this movie's fans, I again must apologize. If you want to see how this type of movie is made well, check out another of Duvall's movies: To Kill A Mockingbird. Or even ""Fried Green Tomatoes."" This one, however, is strictly for little kids.",Secondhand Lions
95,schuhj,Near-miss,8,12 October 2003,"Recently I saw Caine, Duval, and Osment on the Charlie Rose Show, andOsment awes me with his maturity. Sometimes if you didn't know better, you think he is 25, not 15. I think he also amazes his co-stars, too. One can guess that the pairing of Caine and Osment had to happen after  the nice things that Caine said about Osment at the academy awards. Gene Osment  ha s done an amazing job so far keeping this kid's head on straight.
As to the movie: kind of uneven. I don't think that I have ever seen a ranch house like the one they use in this movie, but then Texas is a big state. Duval is the best thing in the movie, since the accent is natural, and in heroic mode he is believable.  Caine's accent keeps slipping, and Osment is too far off. Even city boys had a drawl then. I was surprised they didn't do more with the boy-lion, thing. What they might have done is suggested in the cartoons shown at the end. Osment knows how to behave like a boy his age. Hope he grows up three or four inches so he can slip into age appropriate roles. That is his plan.",Secondhand Lions

Parts of the movie have been recycled from other well done movies of the past.  Secondhand, but oh the craftsmanship.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall are wonderful in this heartwarming, family film that entertains throughout.  The story is as old as the hills, but the script, acting and direction are so masterful that the old story seems new again.  Normally, there is something about Haley Joel Osment that just plain annoys me and although a little of that crops up here or there, I still enjoyed myself throughout the film.  This movie amuses, entertains, tugs the old heart strings in a few, but not too many spots, and throws in just a small helping of wisdom and insight.

Its like; at the beginning you have no clue what the movie is gonna be about, and then as the movie progresses, the characters and storyline absorbs you in a tale of classic adventure of two country wise guys teaching a kid the fun of living life with heart, passion and to the fullest.

Execution fell short.  With a little more work, attention to detail, and maybe re-takes of a few scenes that just didn't pass muster, this could have become a classic.  Especially if the cute little kid was played by a cute little kid rather than a poorly aging juvenile struggling to make the transition to more mature roles.  Sorry to burst your bubble, Haley, but you are washed up.  It's time for a reality check and an application to your local McDonald's.  Hopefully they are hiring. (Seriously, compare his performance here to what he did in Sixth Sense. He's lost the magic.  #$@!!! puberty!!!)Caine and Duvall deliver their lines very convincingly.  It's amazing how the skill of these gentlemen can overcome the context in which they perform.  Without these guys, this movie would be a complete bust.  I sort of wonder if they hired the rest of the cast to make Caine and Duvall look good, because the rest of the ensemble couldn't act at all. How in the world do these people make a living in the entertainment industry is beyond me.Overall, Secondhand Lions will be a nice movie for most folks.

In short, it's a good, old-fashioned, story-telling movie like you rarely find anymore coming out of Hollywood.  That in itself should be worth the price of admission.  To see an excellent group of actors spin their magic with little need of special effects (OK, the lion is animatronic in some scenes) or violence (if you don't count taking pot-shots at passing salesmen) or sex (it does have a love story, which is not the same thing) is so wonderful with the amount of repetitious dreck that normally pours nonstop out of the studios.  Caine and Duvall are like Old Masters that just get better with time, and Haley Joel Osment continues his progress towards becoming a Master himself.  Despite some awkward moments (but then, he's at that awkward age), Haley stands up well in comparison.

113,Rilchiam-1,"Oh, give Haley a break!",9,7 March 2004,"I've been checking the reviews of this movie, and there is a lot of criticism of HJO's performance. I tend to think that the critics and viewers are judging his performance against portrayals of typical pubescent-male characters. Generally, such characters appear only in strictly teenybopper movies, which get glossed over by critics with no particular attention to any one actor, or they appear in comedies or suspense movies.
In comedies, a male character that age can usually be described by his personality flaw. ""Punk"", ""Spoiled Brat"", ""Doofus"", or whatever. This is played broadly, for laughs, for 75% of the film, and then usually he's given that one chance to man up, which he does, and then drops every other characteristic and becomes conservative. In suspense movies, such a character would probably be static: he would start out creepy or violent or sullen, and then stay that way until he gets killed. This movie is neither of these, though. I thought Walter was an excellent character, both as written and as played. He starts out withdrawn, but more wary than resentful: he's too beat-down to be sullen. He's just pathetic enough to make you feel bad for him, but not so much so that you want to smack him. (Well, I didn't...) And for crying out loud, his voice was SUPPOSED to squeak! I suppose you people also think Charlize Theron gave a bad performance in `Monster' because they made her look un-beautiful?Walter's growth as a character depends on his interaction with Hub and Garth, which comes off well. There's a scene where the three of them, without actually saying the words, agree that ""From now on, it's gonna be just us men!"" Walter doesn't get one big dramatic scene where he leaps from boy to man; it's a matter of his being given a lot of small chances, and being guided through a subtle change. I honestly don't know what the people who call HJO's performance ""wooden"" are looking for. Nobody can radiate ""happy"" like he does. And check his last scene. The character has clearly matured, and it's been built up to gradually enough to be believable.Also, I have to respond to John Ulmer's speculation that Haley and Emily Osment are pawns of their parents, and are going to burn out a la the Culkins.I've been a fan of Haley's for several years now (can you tell?), and I've read just about every interview and article that's been printed or appeared on the net. Based on that, I can assert that the only thing Haley has in common with M. Culkin is that they're both blond! He and Emily are acting because they WANT to, not because they're being forced into it. Their parents have gone to infinite trouble to keep their egos and behavior in check, and from all reports, they've done a fine job of it.
I don't see them getting into drugs or any deviant behavior that springs from boredom, need to rebel, lack of boundaries or self-indulgence, because those factors just aren't there. From everything I've read, what they're interested in is acting, not being stars. Have you read or seen any interviews with Haley? It's clear that he takes his work VERY seriously, and he's sensible enough not to do anything that would hurt his reputation and, by extension, his career. And believe me, if either of them ever exhibited any bratty behavior, it would be common knowledge by now. But in fact, every director and adult actor who's worked with them has nothing but good to say.And one last thing. The main part of the movie takes place in the LATE FIFTIES. Maybe 1960, but no later. The flashbacks take place in the NINETEEN-TENS, and the epilogue takes place in the EIGHTIES.",Secondhand Lions

Even Kyra Sedgewick is right for the uncaring, if not flakey Mother.I did however long for Gary Sinese as the new boyfriend.<p> Even the animal cast is wonderful and adding a pet pig to the array of dogs adds a comedic but endearing touch.<p> Most Macho guys won't allow themselves to enjoy this movie, based on the pretense alone.

With the exception of Secondhand Lions, it's too bad that the movie business has forgotten how to make quality movies.  This is the kind of movie grownups can truly enjoy; however, the movie moguls have sought, for the most part, to attract mindless children and childish adults.  But, Secondhand Lions provides a moving, emotional experience seldom seen on the big screen anymore.  Robert Duvall is clearly one of the finest actors to ever appear in film--he was delightful, and Michael Caine excelled.  The return of Halley Joel Osment to the big screen is welcomed.  After watching his performance in this film, one can easily conclude that he's not a child actor who won't make the transition to acting as an adult.  He's going to be around for a very long time.  My personal test of a movie is the answer to the following question.  Would I go see it a second time?  The answer is a resounding YES!",Secondhand Lions

With the obvious onset of puberty, did Haley Joel Osment lose the ability to act?  Turning in the worst performance I've seen since...well, since ""A.I."", I left the theater feeling cheated and violated.  Kyra Sedgewick plays Haley's floozy mother who abandons him with his (possibly) millionaire uncles while she whores herself in Vegas under the guise of attending school. She instructs Haley to ""find the money.""  He eventually does, but do we care?  NO! What we care about is whether the film will ever end.  Thankfully it does...albeit quite predictably. 
The uncles--played with typical brilliance by Robert Duvall and Michael Caine--seemed woefully miscast in this paltry, meager film.  In spite of the many cinematographical (did I just make up a word?) errors, (I didn't realize there were large, round, rubber buoys back in the 1800's), Caine and Duvall brighten this otherwise painful-to-watch film.  The storylines, and there are far too many to get into, are inept, clumsy, and plodding.  The only other bright spot in the film is when the secondhand lion of the title gets to maul, ala Seigfried and Roy, a nasty man Haley's mother brings with her back from Vegas to, apparently, beat the whereabouts of the mysterious millions the uncles may have stashed out of the youngster.While this film might fool the younger audience, for me, it wasn't worth the price of admission--matinee price.",Secondhand Lions

123,SpudV,Great Story of American Hero,10,22 September 2003,"I saw the ""great acting weak story"" knock, but I have to disagree.  No, it's not a serious story or has a complex plot.  ""Secondhand Lions"" is a great story about how people find family/love, and gives us an American mythical hero, Uncle Hub.  At a time when the rest of Hollywood is looking to comic books for a ""hero"", this movie helps remind us of the type of people that made (and are continuing to make) America the great country that it is.While others may see this as a coming of age (centered on Walt) movie, this actually was the story of Uncle Hub and how he fought the good fight, went back home and was given a second chance by taking in Walt.  I won't give specifics on what Uncle Hub did to make him a hero - you'll just have to see it and judge for yourself.  For fans of ""Lonesome Dove"", this will probably be as close as you will get to seeing another great mythical hero, Augustus McCrae, on the screen again.Michael Caine puts in an understated but very good performance.  Haley Joel Osment does another excellent job of picking good characters.  This will turn out to be an excellent ""transition"" film for him as he gets more older teen/young man roles, and matures into what could be a long career for him. He has excellent potential as long as he is selective with his parts.  He does not have much to smile about for much of the film, but at the end when he does smile, the glow not only fills the screen but the whole theater.If you're a sentimental fool like me, you will enjoy this film.

There are two things, however, that make this movie stand out as something extraordinary.The first is the sub-text, which is the artistic core that drives all works of art, and always separates good movies from great ones.  This movie is about integrity of self, believing in what you can do, finding goals not rooted in money or power, choosing to live, and valuing life.   Yet it is not in the least amount preachy.The biggest thing that makes this movie extraordinary is the acting.  Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and Haley Joel Osment have 13 Oscar nominations (and 3 Oscars) between the three of them.  The chemistry of the three is what makes this movie so special.

Likewise, Robert Duvall always gives us outstanding performances such as his parts in The Godfather and many more.Now, the star performance by young Osment in his role as the young lad that came to live with the two old weathered uncles was as good as it gets.

Michael Caine is relatively well known for working for a paycheck without regard to any specific standard but watching him try and speak with a Texas accent is positively excruciating. Robert Duvall has mad many remarkable movies along the way. This is too but not in a good way. His character is without redeeming social value. It is an abomination and yet he is so much better than Haley Joe Osment that I would expect Haley Joe to have given up acting after this debacle.

It was clever enough for adults to enjoy the inside humor and still was very appealing for kids. My son was spellbound. As a bonus, one of my favorite cartoonists, Berke Breathed (Bloom County) supplied the artwork of the adult Walter.Among the many pleasures was the acting of the three leads. Robert Duvall is one of my favorite actors, who can do just about anything. Michael Caine was superb and I thought Haley Joel Osment was terrific in portraying Walter's growth over the summer. Look at how timid he was when he first meets his uncles to the happy, self confident young man at the end, who ""lays down the law"" with his uncles at end about what they have to do now that he is staying. I loved the, ""no beating up teenagers...LESS meat"" speech.Rather the recount the many wonderful moments in the movie that have already been described in other comments, one of my favorite moments in the movie was when the sheriff tells Walter, ""they died with their boots on."", which was exactly what the uncles said about Jasmine when she died saving Walter from Stan. The look on the adult Walter's face when the sheriff said it was priceless.I have not seen the original ending (which will be on the DVD) but I cannot see any other ending than the one in the movie. Some folks thought it was mawkish, but I thought it was perfectly in spirit with the whimsical nature of the movie. Here you had Walter, and the sheik's grandson, who both had heard fantastic stories in their youth, and while they had been enchanted by them, were never sure if they were true. As it turns out, the stories were true. I like that it implies that Walter and the sheik's grandson will be friends as well.

It's not loaded with special effects, computer animation gadgetry; it is low on the violence scale and there is no nudity, nary a curse word nor an epic replete with a cast of thousands. Ah! Just what I needed: a solidly entertaining film, well written, endearing roles played by some of our best actors and, although predictable, an ending that satisfies the soul.I swear I'm becoming a romantic, but this was such an enjoyable experience. Michael Caine as Garth and Robert Duvall as Hub furthered their stature as two of our finest film actors. Haley Joel Osment's portrayal of Walter, their young nephew, affirms himself as one of our best young stars and is destined for greatness. Kyra Sedgewick is perfectly cast as the self-centered, loose mom, but plays the role for laughs. Ms. Sedgewick has always been a favorite of mine and in my opinion has been underrated. I hope to see her cast in more prominent roles.Go ahead and pick-up this DVD. I watched the bonus disk from beginning to end.

143,pkarnold,Staying with the Uncles in Texas,9,27 February 2012,"The first thing I noticed in this film was the farmhouse, a caliche road, and the mailbox--and I knew it was rural Texas. Then I noticed a couple of uncles sitting on their front porch with shotguns, and a young teenage boy not knowing exactly what to think. I was hooked immediately when flipping through the TV channels and seeing Secondhand Lions.This film was made in Pflugerville, a suburb northeast of Austin, and of course there is a rural road, a farm house, and stock tank (pond). It was the first thing that caught my attention, and it felt like Texas. And then there was Michael Cain and Robert Duval playing characters in Texas. I've seen this movie five times or so, and it is not difficult to imagine Robert Duval playing a character from Texas. However, Michael Cain, well if his Texas accent wasn't perfect, his character was perfectly played! And as brilliant as Cain might have been, Robert Duval was just as good as Robert Duval can be, and that's about as good as it gets. Cain plays Garth, and Duval plays Hub and the 13-or 14-year-old Walter is basically dumped with the uncles by his mother one afternoon. The uncles aren't happy about the situation. Walter's not happy about the stranding with the uncles. But the audience is in for a treat as this story develops.While Haley Joel Osment played a believable Walter, and Kyra Sedgwick was also excellent as Mae the mom, the movie's writer and director Tim McCanlies has to be given credit for a realistic setting, and an amazing story that allows character development, and what might be a pretty bad situation, child abandonment with strange relatives, to become a wonderful story.Yes, Cain and Duval play curmudgeonly uncles, but they also play loving and caring uncles who grow so close to Walter, they try to figure out how to protect him from his irresponsible mother. Work in some traveling salesmen, that occasionally succeed in getting past the shotgun blasts from the front porch, to sell garden seeds (in a variety of packages, but only corn grew), or to sell a sickly lioness, and this plot is wonderful.The lioness is nurtured back to health by Walter, but one day she escapes and heads into the garden of fully grown corn. I probably would have named this movie ""Lions in the Cornfield,"" because that is an extremely strong image from this movie, and seeming ridiculous situation. But Secondhand Lions actually uses the symbol of the uncles as aging, yet protective lions who have had better days, and Jasmine the lioness, to communicate all that is quirky and good in life.As strong as Duval and Cain may be in their acting roles, the story is equally as idealistic in siding with right, and opposing evil. When a movie is idealistic, and believable, and fun, I can't help but give this film a solid recommendation (9 of 10 stars).",Secondhand Lions

Not saying that Haley Joel Osment is not good, actually he's quite brilliant as well, but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed at his contribution to the movie...not saying his acting is bad, just that his role didn't give him much room to develop, and that his character is actually NOT the most important character in the movie...a bit restricted, so overall he's doing good but not good enough. Hopefully in the near future he'll receive some powerful roles like those in Sixth Sense and A.I.. (But...to be frank, it's really very nice to see him in a happy film once rather than always seeing him in somekind of heavy, dark, gloomy or sad film...though the later might make him shine like a diamond...)It's always the heavy films that creates great actors, not light-hearted ones, so I don't blame Osment if he didn't seem to outshine Caine and Duvall in this film.Caine and Duvall, everyone knows their powerful acting, but Osment's big time is yet to be seen. I definitely see talent in him, he's a rare gem, that is to be sure, but whether he'll turn out to be the biggest star in this generation (ie. those who were born in the 80s), the next Peter O'Toole or Paul Newman or Tom Hanks, is remained to be seen. Personally I think he'll get there quite easily if he keeps on his work and talent and personality and not being worn out by fame and fortune. So keep up the work n let 'em see your colours, Osment!",Secondhand Lions
145,NeHaud,A Heartwarming Tale...,7,2 June 2011,"Who would have ever thought that Michael Caine and Robert Duvall would ever be in a movie together? These two actors have played such opposite characters in their acting careers that putting them together in a movie would be a major task...however, this movie not only succeeds in the pairing but also excels in it. The two actors support each other magnificently, making the movie such a treat to watch. The movie is uplifting and such a blast, masterfully combining comic relief with more serious themes. (I nearly died laughing when Michael Caine said the word ""ain't,"" never dreaming in a thousand I would hear the British actor go country.) The movie is a perfect ""coming of age"" story, with good morals and lessons. I don't want to go into too much detail with the movie, less I ruin some truly amazing scenes, but I recommend it for any family movie night.",Secondhand Lions

It reminded me of my own years of growing up, the 1950's-early 1960's, and while all memories are not fond, this movie elicits the response of my memories which are truly fine! SECONDHAND LIONS is about a boy who grew up in about the same time-frame as myself (or at least it appears so.) I had parents. This boy had a mother who wasn't much of a mother. But the uncles... my, they are exceptional! Lots of laughs, lots of introspection... some philosophizing...I recommend this movie heartily! Did you like MY DOG SKIP? Not that the stories are anything alike... it's just that, well, they both have that ability to tug on your heartstrings and really please you for the entertainment value they contain! Yes, I am just a sentimentalist. A romantic and a left-over, from the 60's. But it isn't difficult to love life!",Secondhand Lions

He acts like he's still stuck in AI as a robot...same facial expressions, same movements, same complete lack of acting ability. The story had all kinds of potential to be good, but it just wasn't. It leaves you wanting. Supposedly a relationship develops between the boy and the two old guys, but that development is never shown. It happens in about a matter of five minutes and it keeps you wondering where that bond ever came from in the first place.I rented this hoping for a good one-timer, but it wasn't even that.

Ultimately his respect becomes outright fascination with the rich character of these two men.

The boy grows and matures through the movie in a way rarely seen.  The dream scenes are done like they would have been done in movies from fifty years ago, and as they were supposed to have taken place fifty years ago, they fit wonderfully.

158,marc-577-718725,struggling to believe it,2,17 June 2013,"After watching Secondhand Lions (which we had bought on blue ray as a wild card in a sale), I struggled to comprehend what I had just seen. I viewed the feature about how the story was accepted and produced by New Line Cinema and still felt baffled. The screenwriter / director's four-page rant at a previous producer, who had suggested certain changes, shed more light on the singular mindset behind the film than on the story. At the same time, so many studio officials said how it was the writer's most personal script, and how they absolutely loved it, that I wondered what I might have missed. Turning to the reviews on IMDb as a sanity check, and the majority of the reviews being positive, I was initially not sure I'd seen the same film.I reckon the most important question the film asks is what stories to believe. Walter is about 13 years old and the only people in his life present him with challenging versions of the truth. At the start of the film, Walter's mother prepares to pack him off to his great-uncles with all kinds of speculations about their wealth, their brief remaining life expectancy, and Walter's chances of becoming their heir just by paying them an unannounced visit for an indefinite period of time. On the other hand, Walter's uncles, who spend most of their time shooting at salesmen and trying to build their own airplane, tell tall tales set in the Middle East about a beautiful princess, an evil sheik, and bags and bags full of gold pieces.It could be a comedy, given all the flat characters. There is also a suitably annoying bunch of hillbilly relatives and an inconsequential quartet of fight-eager late teens who look like rebels with no cause times four.But it isn't funny. Just when things get so ridiculous one might want to laugh - the quartet of teens that get beaten to pulp by one of the uncles eagerly take in his Wise Old Man's speech on How To Be A Good Man in the next scene, for instance - there are hugs, eager looks from Walter who wants to hear the speech too and become a Good Man, and intense music to tell us that this is Significant.However, things that really are significant are brushed under the carpet. Walter is aware that his mother is lying to him; that she is ready to abandon him in search of the next boyfriend; and that the next boyfriend is likely to be an idiot who will end up beating her (presumably like all the previous ones). Instead of dealing with this in a sensitive way, the film gives us a bunch of ""keep the kid(s) happy"" surrogates.The uncles provide entertainment in the form of exotic stories, but their idea of providing food amounts to hacking at a vegetable patch with a shovel and shooting fish with a gun. A random lioness turns up who protects Walter from his mother's latest, and predictably violent, boyfriend. The animal does this apparently because Walter had previously set her free in a corn field - where the meat-eater presumably turned vegetarian. Oh, and a surreal amount of money scattered in a basement under the porch (some of it in safes, but with the safe doors open) provides a bit of mystery, but quickly dissolves into irrelevance. Everybody seems to know about it anyway, including the thick relatives; Walter ignores any rumours about theft, and chooses to believe the tales about African adventures and gold pieces; but most of all, the story has lost the plot by this time, and no amount of money stacked wherever can save it.I've seen films before that were an equal waste of time, but I've never felt compelled to write such a long review of them. Maybe it is because I am trying to comprehend how the studio that produced The Lord of the Rings allowed Secondhand Lions to happen. And how such a respectable cast, and support from a heap of well-trained animals with potential for comedy to boot, ended up in such a mess. The most offensive thing about this mess is how it pretends to be family entertainment, while not a single family value I am aware of is upheld, or parodied, or dealt with in any other mature way. Someone's review on the IMDb said this film was as responsible a type of entertainment for kids as pornography, and I sadly have to agree.",Secondhand Lions

I also enjoyed all the extras that are included on the DVD, such as the alternate scenes and the alternate ending. I highly suggest that you watch them after seeing the movie itself.

The fact that it's suitable for the whole family is a plus.Everyone already knows the plot, so I won't go into that.  I found this movie to be entertaining from the very beginning and never felt a dull moment in it.There was one thing I found confusing...when they brought the lion, we all assumed that the giraffe was included as well, but it apparently was not, since we didn't see it again.The only fault I found with the movie was the timeline.  The movie states that the two uncles went to Europe as young men and arrived around the time Germany invaded France (1940) and were gone 40 years.  If this were so, it would be 1980 or so when they returned to Texas.  This movie begins in what appears to be the late 50's to early 60's, judging from the cars and attire, so the timeline is rather skewed.This is a big booboo to me, but I thought the movie was so endearing, so entertaining, and so well acted, I can look past the timeline due to the sheer delight of the movie.",Secondhand Lions

Walter's face in every scene looks as if he's has never seen anything in his life! The only action within this movie is when his mother drives away in the beginning.First of all, the beginning was hazy. Every time someone would show up to the uncles' door, they would start shooting at them (and unfortunately this happens a lot). Then an annoying family constantly visits the uncles. Secondly, the story about Jasmine was supposedly supposed to be imaginative and cartoonish, but it was just boring crap. All they did was fight people and kiss Jasmine. Thirdly, there was no plot. Really, there was no plot. Throughout the movie I was trying to distinguish a plot, but I couldn't come up with one! What is the plot? Walter wanting to find the secret stash of cash? NO! That's a terrible plot.Altogether, this movie was boring and uninteresting, especially because it lacked a plot. Maybe I just didn't see it, but I couldn't tell what is was.

(that was being hauled to the Uncles property, along with the lion.) And were the Uncles really going to do a live hunt with that poor lion? I didn't like that they left it in the crate, or the idea that it could run wild on the property...remember all the dogs and the pig running loose? Where did they go while this lion was running around?Anyhow, I seem to nit-pick films that use animals of any kind in their movies.

165,Man_in_the_Top_Hat,"""Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most.""",10,7 October 2020,"This wonderful little film really kind of blindsides you as it goes along, evoking powerful emotion and hopefully reflection on what really matters in life. Like many of the truly important movies out there that should be seen, it was critically panned, horribly/barely marketed, and a commercial failure. The general consensus among ""professional"" critics was it was ""overly sentimental"" and ""cartoonish."" To that I would say most of those people are so far removed from the basic humanity this movie imparts that they probably felt personally attacked for their illegitimate profession and life decisions.I'm not going to discuss too much about the actual plot of this movie, because it does need to be seen and experienced without spoilers. Instead I want to touch on the themes and use simple descriptors: if the following things appeal to the person reading this review even a little bit, then this is a movie they should see. It is straightforward and earnest. It is positive and optimistic. It is both noble and wonderfully outlandish. It is gentle and wholesome. It might even make you believe in things like dignity, integrity, passion, and benevolence: even when the world around you (especially now, as I write this in late 2020) seems to have absolutely no use for such concepts.I think the best compliment I can give Seconhand Lions is that my affection grows for it each time I see it. Yet I've probably only watched it a total of four, maybe five times. For a movie that is nearly 20 years old now that I happen to adore, that really isn't a lot of viewings. It's like an old friend that you seldom see because they live far away, and when you catch up one of the best parts is that you take stock of how you have changed and grown since you last visited. You can count on this friend, because you know they live by a code and are a tree with deep roots: unwavering and strong even against the torrents and storms of a world that seeks to snuff their kind out. The kind of friend that reminds you that when it comes to adventures: the best one...is the next one.",Secondhand Lions

At first I wondered just when Michael Caine was going to appear in the film, much to my surprise he was the brother of Robert Duvall. Now that is acting!! I actually had to pause the dvd and zoom in to make certain it was Caine. No, I am not talking special effects...I am talking personal alteration to acommodate the role. Michael Caine is truly awesome.Osment's performance matched those of his co-stars. In my opinion, Haley Joel Osment is a natural born actor. The movie was well written. The direction was superior. Ah to be carefree and eccentric like Duvall and Caine[Garth and Hub respectively]. Osment[Walter] was both student and teacher in this wonderful story. I rated the film a 10.

Osment was great as usual.The only criticism I have is that they probably could have done without the ending because I found it took some of the mystery away from the storyline and the mystery was part of the story's appeal.

It could have been good, and I think that must be what most people who like it are responding to (in both movies)--a nice coming of age story. But the finished product stunk.

She does this so she can run off with her latest boy and also in hope that her son can find out where their money is buried.  All young Walter (Haley Joel Osmant) wants is a sense of love, truth and security.

On a serious note, this movie has word like damn in it, so you might not want your sub-10-year old to watch it. Adults? ABSOLUTELY. And I defy you not to get misty-eyed. Not that it's a sad movie. It's not. It's a movie that will leave you feeling good, and you'll try not to, but you'll end up recommending it. I lent the Netflix to my parents (after giving me the anchovy look), and afterward, they lent it to their neighbors (who I'm sure gave them the anchovy look). Watch the movie. Trust me.",Secondhand Lions
184,biz1201,A very unexpected awesome movie!,10,15 August 2016,"A friend recommended me to watch this movie had never heard of it, but once I saw Michael Caine and Robert Duvall in it that was definitely the deal breaker. This movie really touches your heart it's wonderful and warm .. Caine and Duvall as always on the top of their game. And Osment was the perfect child for this role. I loved everything about this movie especially when Osment (Walter) is sent to stay with his uncles, he learns a lot about life and in return so do his great uncles who have never raised a child nor wanted to. This movie is ideal for both males and females .. Caine and Duvall are just awesome in their roles as brothers and Caine's storytelling to Walter is fantastic. Highly recommend if you haven't given this a watch to definitely do so I can't really see anyone not enjoying this movie.",Secondhand Lions
185,karennash,A Family friendly movie,10,21 February 2017,"I recently watched this film and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is a great family friendly movie with great cast of main characters and supporting actors. Michael Caine and Robert Duvall as the old uncles are fabulous and i couldn't see anyone else doing these characters justice. I'm a fan of Christian Kane so the choice of him for a younger version worked very well for me. Hayley Joel Osment is great as the young Walter is so appealing.The flashbacks are a little tongue in cheek and are meant that way as they are told to a young boy and given a little ""poetic license"" to entertain him. I think that this movie has something for everyone and can't think of a reason for anyone to dislike it. A great way to spend an hour and 3/4!",Secondhand Lions
186,gary-faust,Fantastic Film!,10,6 March 2006,"To be honest I don't see a lot of the new movies that come out. My wife and I being Christians don't care to see 99% of the R rated films that come out. Uneeded sex scenes and foul language muddy up many films. Second Hand Lions has neither and yet has everything that a film needs to get and hold your attention. The characters played by Michael Caine, Haley Osment and Robert Duvall are so interesting that the scenes fly by leaving you wanting more. Two old bachelors (played by Caine and Duvall) take in an all but orphaned relative (Osment). At first neither are happy with the arrangement but come to tolerate each other and then to need each other. But this movie isn't all sap. There is adventure, thrill and even some fantasy not to mention the laughs. I don't care who you are see this movie- you'll like it.",Secondhand Lions
187,kballing,A great movie to watch with Grandpa,8,9 February 2006,"I found this movie absolutely delightful and I could relate. I spent a few years out of the country and really didn't see many movies. When I returned, I asked my family what I had missed. This was number 3 on their list. Now I think everybody has got a relative, grandfather, uncle, cousin, etc., that is one of those crazy rough and tumble guys that can tell one whopper of a story. My grandpa is just such a person. When I watched it with my grandparents my grandpa didn't get it, but my grandma thought it was hilarious. So, Robert Duvall and Micheal Caine live up to their reputations as phenomenal actors and nail their parts. Haley Joel Osmeth is such a weenier. I guess that is what he is supposed to be though. Anyway, it is definitely worth seeing, probably worth owning.",Secondhand Lions

189,scatmull,Believable and Unbelievable at the same time,9,10 January 2004,"One of the minor themes of this movie is that of belief.  It gives you several things to find believable and others to find unbelievable.  One of the way that I gauge a character driven movie is whether I believe that the characters have changed or been changed.  This movie succeeded for me in that respect.Along the way, I really enjoyed the storytelling of the uncles' past.  I thought that was well handled.  I also enjoyed the sense of humor throughout the movie.  It was clean and that made it unique in today's films.Sure, it was not without it's faults.  There was some over-the-top acting in some small scenes but not ones that will leave lasting impressions.In the end this reminded me of Princess Bride with a message to tell.",Secondhand Lions
190,angelshadow97,Beautiful Movie,10,24 October 2006,"I believe this is one of the best characters Michael Cain has ever portrayed. I have probably watched this movie about twenty five times at least. I've watched all the special features on how they made the movie and watched it with and without the directors commentary. It is a very moving motion picture. I think my favorite part is when Garth (Michael) is sitting with young Walter, watching Uncle Hub and beginning the story of their adventures. Also, the part where Walter is talking to Uncle Hub about how much he is needed. Robert Duvall shows such deep emotion in that scene. But the whole movie is great.It is a great family movie and can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. The story line is very easy to follow and very real and believable. At the end I wished I had someone one in my family who would have loved and cared for me they way the uncles did Walter. It made me want to be that kind of person.One thing I wish I could have heard was the speech Uncle Hub gives to young men on how to be a man. But, I'm a woman and I love details. . .Get your whole family together and watch this movie!!!",Secondhand Lions

The top four actors Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Haley Joel Osment, and Kyra Sedgwick continue the excellence that is the norm for all four. They are so good it is hard to imagine who else could have played the roles. And the rest of the cast is flawless. The story itself is not predictable, but seems almost simple-at first. But then it quickly, without being rushed, adds action, adventure, and even exotic locations.It's funny without jokes. Moving without being cloying.Unbelievable, but still credible, moral, and principled.Rush out and rent it, find it on TV, or put it on your NetFlix or Blockbuster Online list.You will be glad you did.rto1",Secondhand Lions

Robert Duvall and Michael Caine, as always, were excellent in their roles (even though no matter how hard he tried, Sir Michael couldn't completely hide that accent!) Haley Joel Osment kind of seemed like a cross between Cameron in Ferris Bueller and Forrest Gump - the kind of awkward, innocent, sweet goober head that worms his way into your heart.  These three actors seemed to just immerse themselves in their roles and to me, were 100% believable. We were in a packed theater, and the audience was very responsive (in a positive way) to this movie. Laughs, gasps, sighs and sniffs.

It's both far-fetched and absolutely real.The best comparison I can think of is Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell--if you enjoyed that, this will also tickle your fancy, though Robert Duvall and Michael Caine are two crusty old men in an unpainted Texas farmhouse. But they become the only stability that their great-nephew has ever known.  I laughed and cried, and I will buy it on DVD.Go see it, both for the trailer of ROTK, and for its own sake--you won't be sorry on either count!!",Secondhand Lions

I can honestly say this is one of my most favorite movies ever! The kid from 6th sense does another fantastic job! He is able to show sad emotions, and its phenomenal! Michael Cain is able to play an excellent Texan! You wouldn't guess a British man could do it, but he did! Robert Duvall, does his thing again! I don't know how to explain it with words, but he has his way of acting. It works great with the roles he plays, and he makes a new standard with this movie.

The story is a simple one that's been told many times before - mismatched people who end up changing each other. Sure the story is predictable, but it's told in a pleasing way, with a flash-back story unfolding as the main story progresses.Duval and Caine are magnificent - why they weren't nominated for an Oscar beats me. Caine is a much more plausible Texan, than any American that ever tried a cockney accent. Osment is superb, though he struggles a bit to when the part calls for a more adult dialogue.I read that the DVD has the original ending - I hope it's even better than the original - I'm off to buy it in the morning.

I also think that this movie will teach someone a lesson of behaviour towards the elderly. You never know who you are dealing with... This movie shows human relations very well.

His tough character wears his heart upon his sleeve and his movements and body actions just kept me hearing words of wisdom from my father. I have watched some other performances of his and he so reminds me of my father I get teary eyed and have to give him a call back home in Indiana. The entire cast/writers/directors deserve the highest praise!

Haley Joel Osment is perfect as well as Kira Sedgwick. I must not end this review without a special reference: many animals in the film got their unique expression.

For those who thought it was sugary and sappy, just plain corny... well, that's why there's chocolate and vanilla ice cream!I for one have been involved with lots of big budget films that Hollywood churns out ( I own Digital Domain, the visual effects company)... but, for me, there was something about SECONDHAND LIONS that moved me.

You don't see movies like this out of Hollywood every day, perhaps why I had not heard of it, it features great star power and an excellent story.Robert Duvall delivers and Oscar worthy performance (once again) as the moody ""Uncle Hub,"" who misses his youth.Michael Caine gives a surprisingly well done Texan accent to his performance as ""Uncle Garth,"" the obviously more generous and caring of the two.Haley Joel Osment gives one of his best performances yet as the unsure and confused ""Walter,"" who has to deal with a less than perfect mother.Walter is dropped off at the house of two seemingly uncaring and moody old men, who he is told are his great uncles. His mother (May) then leaves without even looking back. At first the three don't really get along, but as the movie progresses you will see all of them change.The stories told by Garth are fantastic and unbelievable to an adult, but turn out to be just what Walter needs.I recommend this movie to anyone who has a family, great lessons taught in this one.",Secondhand Lions

It hits on many of the themes of a recent book by John Eldgredge called, ""Wild at Heart."" The values of ""some things are worth fighting for,"" ""true love,"" ""a man loving one woman with a passion,"" ""having a purpose in life"" and others shine through. Duval is terrific.

My two boys (11 & 7) and my wife and I saw it all together and I was amazed at how they were moved to comment. There was humor and depth of thought coming from my kids as we sat in the den and watched this movie. I wonder how the parents of girls would react to it but no matter, if you've got boys they HAVE to see this movie.There is a quote (elsewhere on this site) from the movie to the effect that whether an idea is true or not does not dictate whether it is worth believing in. At first glance that might seem ridiculous, but taken in the context of the movie and from the character who speaks it, it is one of the most compelling and idealistic thoughts I've ever heard from a film.This story is a fairy tale from the same fairy tale school as ""The Princess Bride,"" and just like that movie, you don't care whether or not the story is true, you enjoy it because it is a wonderful story.The humor is sparkling, the scenery is inspiring, the acting is superb, and the story is entertaining.

I do not know if a sequel is already planned.My idea is: Hud's baby did not die, but was swapped. A younger wife of a Sheik had a still born baby girl, and when Jasmine died, she swapped babies. She raised the baby, not telling her who her father was, but still interesting her in the goings on of Hud. The daughter had three baby girls and died, the grandmother raising the three. Both the mother and grandmother related tales of Hud and Garth to the girls. On her deathbed she told the girls (about 20 years of age) of their grandfather. She gave them a object as proof. They set out for the US.The grandmother had seen that they got good educations, learned English, Martial Arts etc. One of the girls could be a Hud clone in dering do.

The kid and his nasal voice are consistently annoying, puberty has not been kind to that young man. The idea of the two brothers living alone is sort of amusing, but their relationship never really comes out. Also, that scene where the plane flies under the overpass in the preview is not actually in the movie.

Are there any of us who cannot remember a time when young, and a parent said ""I'm doing this for you, not for me"" when it wasn't true whatsoever. Michael Caine and Robert Duvall were perfectly cast for this film. I have seen it several times, and the tears come every single time. Is there anyone who hasn't thought ""if I were able to live my childhood over again, or in a different place, or time.""

And, while I thought that the ""kid"" (Haley Joel) was cute when he was younger, I think that he probably should start looking for another gig.The production values were more than acceptable, but it would take more than that to save this stinker.  Flashbacks to French Foreign Legion exploits, the arrival of worn out circus animals (a giraffe, which seems to completely disappear after its first appearance and a lion--- I guess there had to be a lion, given the title)did not help much.I should have known better, but I am a big French Bulldog fan, so it wasn't a total loss.",Secondhand Lions

She is 13 and can appreciate a movie that tells a good story and plot. To me, this is a classic and a must see for any family that has any traditional values at all.

217,kallbjosson,A floozy drops of her ca. ten-year-old for old uncles to look after,1,3 March 2008,"The worst, most stupid movie I have seen in a long time. I hate movies like this, especially the way their message/agenda goes. Near the end of the movie Robert Duvall says young people should believe in things that they know might not be true, because they are worth believing. He is talking about ""true lies"" (a title of another stupid movie), or convenient lies -- delusions which help you in life. The young and innocent are probably also encouraged to belief that Right is Wrong and vice versa. It is very helpful to believe whatever is convenient for us is ""Right"". And calculate what kind of beliefs promis good pay-off. Then pick accordingly. Sounds familiar. Sounds like G.W.Bush and it is not a very ethical.The old men are introduced as they are trying to shoot fish in a pond. That establishes their characters from the get go, as stupid and ignorant--not eccentric nor genius, which was perhaps the intent of the filmmaker. The harmless good-natured use of firearms is repeatedly demonstrated, especially when everybody runs into the house to pick up a gun to shoot the lion. Even young children who can not hold the big rifles (or shotguns) mush less use them safely, go after the lion. The experienced gunmen (the old brothers) and the other adults present allow it and it is not treated as an issue.(it is supposed to be funny) The tall tales the one brother, Michael Cane tells, which are obvious lies, turn out to be true. One of those true lies about Americans kicking ass in other countries. The plot is so stupid and the sentimental clichés so bad and predictable that I had to watch it just to see how bad bad can get. I think this film is as bad an influence on the young and innocent of all ages, as pornography and celebrity poker.",Secondhand Lions

If a movie doesn't have a story line, it's boring...I feel that this movie is one of those few movies coming out of Hollywood these days that doesn't fall back on the ""can we get a sequel out of it"" genre.The casting has been brilliant in getting the right people for the roles that they play and they bring a lot to the movie.

Probably the best idea, story and characters that made into family movie. Really enjoy this movie. Robert Duvall and Michael Caine as usual always play charismatic character and humorist at the same time.Haley Joel also as usual play the character who in the middle of inner conflict of trust with himself and his mom, but eventually could solve based on his experience with his uncles.Very recommended movie for family and all age, and maybe never get bored to watch this movie for the second and third time.",Secondhand Lions
225,craig-andrew-h,An unexpected rare gem. Share this movie with others.,10,11 September 2010,"Every now and then you stumble across something that inspires and moves you. A movie that is somehow understated, gentle, humorous yet powerful in both story and personal life messages. A movie that is at first glimpse simple in its telling, yet slowly meanders through many heart felt and brilliant scenes with apparently no rush.Secondhand Lions is such a movie. It truly is a diamond in the rough.I watched this on my own, and felt fortunate to have seen this. This movie has been given the tag ""family movie"". I will make sure my own young family get to view this movie, as there really is something of substance to this. This movie has teeth, and is one where the family can talk and discuss many aspects of life, and how best to live it. Whilst some people may think this is soppy, it is in fact the very opposite of this. Secondhand Lions has a warm story that doesn't over indulge for the cheap mushy sentimental message.My criteria in recommending movies, has always been how I have felt at the end of the movie. Did it take me somewhere, or has it moved me, or evoked/questions about life and relationships, was the story engrossing.Secondhand Lions has ticked all the boxes. If I could recommend just the one ""family"" movie (non animated!!), then I am most content in suggesting this.Be warned though, you may need a box of tissues on standby (I certainly needed it).Please view this movie, you will not be disappointed.",Secondhand Lions

I rented it from netflix and the DVD was scratched up pretty bad. I got to see everything up till the point Walter reaches the farm and the police says something about the uncles trying to fly through the barn upside down. I know that there is not much after that. It is only one chapter of the DVD. I believe I made only till the middle of chapter 20 and I think the time stopped at about one hour and thirty eight minutes...if that assists anyone in helping me out. After that I have no clue what happened. Please someone fill me in on the end. Thanks!,Secondhand Lions

Not since Cecil B. Demille, have I witnessed such a great interweaving of script, director, and cast. This movie will remain one of my top-five favorites of all time. While a completely fresh and original story, the film has all of the impact of the great films mentioned previously. Eventhough I saw a pre-screening of this movie, I intend to see it again, as well as, buy the DVD when available. ""Secondhand Lions"" should definitely be an academy award nominee in several catagories, such as Best Actor, Best supporting actor, best screenplay, and best Director.

It is hilarious without vulgar humor. The characters are real people (I'm a Texan -- believe me, they are real!) and they unfold through a story that is unique.  It is touching without being overly sentimental.The critics are too busy noting that Haley is growing up and that Michael isn't a Texan to appreciate the overall effect of this movie. Yes, it has a couple of flaws here and there.  Haley is actually the catalyst, not the star.  The story is presented through his eyes, how he saw the uncles and their world.  He is in awe because it is a very different world than his.  Michael isn't a Texan, but he gives a fine performance.  He and Robert played off each other so well!Anyone who wants to experience a lot of laughs and come out of the theater feeling good should go see this movie!",Secondhand Lions
235,staplek,Achieves Excellence!,10,22 September 2003,"""Secondhand Lions"" is a movie which has achieved excellence.  The story line is fast-moving and packed with nuance.  Various elements of the plot overlap and blend for a harmonious whole.  It is not a series of action scenes played primarily for visual impact, but a compelling story which demands attentive viewing.Flashback scenes are intentionally cartoonish, so that the audience, like the character of the boy Walter, is left wondering whether the fantastic tales of the old uncles' adventurous youth are really to be believed. Uncle Garth tells the stories, which we see through Walter's imagination.  We see in the flashbacks what Walter envisions as he hears the stories, and Walter doesn't have the age and experience to see anything other than the caricatures which appear in the flashback scenes.  It's not a photo-accurate rendition, it's what a youngster imagines while listening to oral storytelling.  For instance, a twelve-year-old Texan in the 1950s wouldn't have been likely to know what a really angry Sheik would have looked like in the 1920s.  These flashbacks, and the ways in which they are depicted, are central to the plot of the movie.  Through his storytelling, without realizing it, Uncle Garth nurtures a creative potential in Walter (who will grow up to become a cartoonist).Christian Kane is a magnificent casting choice as young Uncle Hub (the younger incarnation of Duvall's character), displaying just the right kind of spark for the daring adventurer.  Kyra Sedgwick is eerily believable as Walter's shallow and self-absorbed mother.  The family of hick relatives is superbly annoying.Haley Joel Osment delivers a solid portrayal of Walter.  Sometimes his voice sounds like that of a boy, sometimes like that of a young man, as would be expected in a male of Walter's age.  Sometimes Walter cries like a child, sometimes he displays stoic maturity, as would be expected from a boy who is in the transition of becoming a man.  We see Walter unsure of himself in the beginning, but later finding his footing.  Not too sugary, not too hard-edged, Haley Joel Osment is ideal for the role.  He may be overshadowed by Caine and Duvall, but actually holds his own reasonably well, working between these two living legends.Michael Caine's accent as Uncle Garth is a perfect portrayal of a Texan who has lived outside Texas for much of his life.  Garth is no bumpkin hick, but a man who has traveled the world, and in light of his experiences it would not have been credible to give this character a strong country drawl. Even though, as the plot progresses, we don't know how much of Garth's fantastic storytelling we should believe, there is never a question of whether Garth has ventured outside the Texas borders.  (Education and travel tend to have the effect of diminishing regional accents.  I have lived in Texas for twenty years, and have known many older native Texans whose diction is much like Garth's.)  Michael Caine gives Uncle Garth just the right combination of toughness and tenderness, and treads the fine line of allowing us to see Garth as a trustworthy character regardless of his adventurous stories.The uncles are very realistic characterizations, and Texas holds many characters like them.  The aging uncles had, as young men, gone away to find adventure, and lived on the edge for much of their lives.  Then they returned home to retire in a rural Texas setting which they were finding to be just a little too tame, no longer remembering much about Texas country life except for acquiring the obligatory too many dogs.  The uncles don't say much to each other because there is no need to say much, they understand each other perfectly.  Confronted with age, they seek out reckless behavior, unwilling to sit still and get older, unable to overtly give up on life. Walter's presence suddenly requires them to adapt to new purpose, and to take care of themselves, too, as they are faced with the issue of providing appropriate male role models so that their young nephew might one day become an appropriate man.Despite the studio's description, this is not a ""heartwarming"" movie with a happy, fluffy resolution for all concerned.  The characters must make choices, and not always easy ones.  The valiant tales of adventure don't always conclude with happily-ever-after fairytale endings.  It is not purely a comedy, but instead probes the depths of emotion.  The adult audience will probably appreciate this movie the most, but it is an appropriate movie for pre-teens as well.",Secondhand Lions

The film contained some really good scenes that were very humorous as well as a little corny, but Hey, I sometimes like corny.  Another treat was the sound track.

She takes Walter to the home of two of his rich and eccentric uncles that he has never met before with instructions to find out where their money is. She leaves him there while she goes on another one of her man hunting expeditions. A great movie for all ages! We went on a bus trip to South Dakota a couple of weeks ago and this movie was shown.

We had to skip scenes because they were so ""poignant"" and ""touching."" Puberty is proving to be quite a disaster for Haley-Joel Osment and the good sensibility of Michael Caine and Robert Duvall has come into serious question here. Maybe they needed some money. Secondhand Lions is mind-numbingly boring and predictable, not to mention extremely nauseating. Personally, I think it was worse than Gigli, and only marginally better than Glitter. Ifyou're a big softy who cries at Hallmark commercials and you like the ear-splitting yelps of pubescent boys, you might enjoy this movie.Otherwise, do something else. Anything. Go for a walk.

I'm quite glad that some of the favoured characters do actually die in this film instead of them living forever or something cheesy which would be in character for this film.

The times of the movie is reminiscent to me as it is in my time, too; where children were left behind, in orphanages, extended families, etc. etc. How kind these two uncles were...(I know, it was just a story), but quite believable. It shows that if more of us tended to the young people in our lives (not money but time and care) as they did, we would have a much better world.Too, the times show men when they were men...such as shooting the fish out of the water...how cool that was. There was nothing they couldn't do...my husband was like that; but they were also kind, not sappy, but kind. It makes one feel so secure. Michale Caine and Robert Duvall were perfect in their roles...so believable. I can relate to them with having a gun ready to deal with anything. Helps us to believe the stories of their escapades.I loved the Lion....he played a great part...a great pet.The dogs and pig were so cute...and played their parts well.We need more movies such as these where one is entertained and need not turn-off the TV once in a while because of language, etc.If I can find one, I would like to read the book.Congratulations to everyone for a job well-done...keep them coming.A great movie and at times I forgot that it wasn't real!!!",Secondhand Lions

256,travislangendoen97,"On my Favorite's list, and there to stay!!!",9,7 October 2014,"Secondhand Lions is a heartwarming film suitable for both children and adults alike. It is entertaining superficially for children, yet contains a complex plot and in-depth emotional development that most adults will find entertaining. This film skillfully mixes emotions, action and an interesting character development scenario that definitely makes it worth a watch. The acting in Secondhand Lions has mostly good quality acting throughout the film, however I felt that Walter, played by Haley Joel Osment, was overdone in a few scenes. Nevertheless, any scene that was flawed was amply compensated for by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall playing Garth and Hub. The combined experience and comedy of these two men is invaluable. In addition to the main characters, the secondary characters were also all well played, although in some circumstances the acting appeared slightly 'cheesy'. The overall storyline and plot were well laid out and written in an easy to understand way. As I mentioned earlier, Secondhand Lions is easy to understand, but still contains in-depth material that will leave you thinking for days after your first viewing of the film. The plot contains many common concepts such as multiple conflicts between good and evil in which good triumphs, love and hate, and adventurous youth. But this film also has some less common plot concepts, such as coming of age, which is interestingly paired with an 'ageing past your prime' concept. Throughout the film, we see how Walter slowly learns how to be a man, and how Garth an especially Hub, learn how to find usefulness in their old age. Secondhand Lions makes use of several techniques which include flashbacks, proper use (and style) of music, as well as believable characters and storyline. The proper integration of these qualities into the film make it comprehensibly and logical, while still stirring emotions and feelings. Very rarely does a movie achieve both logical and emotion ends at the same time. Overall, Secondhand Lions is a quality film that I would recommend to anyone and everyone. The combination of all the factors I mentioned previously, whether they be negative or positive, turn this film into a completely unique experience rivaled by no other. I can only hope that newer films with large budgets do not eclipse this film from the minds of the continent wide film community. Either way, Secondhand Lions has a spot on my favorites list, and it is there to stay. Travis Langendoen",Secondhand Lions
257,anderson-apryl,Waking the Dead,10,12 January 2005,"I am very critical about movies, especially the ones which will pass before the eyes of my 9 & 7-yr old daughters, so I was extremely surprised and impressed with Secondhand Lions. I was washed away by the depth of this movie and challenged by what it presented. Tucked into the mystery of the uncles' past (unraveling in the moonlight) is a revelation of a life well-lived. What drives man to a life of adventure and where does he go when his body can't keep up? What, when, where determines how he passes the wisdom of the ages? Created in the image of God, we are challenged to be fully alive while we have the strength. ""Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things that man needs to believe in the most"" and I won't spoil the movie for you by giving you the carrot. I will tell you that there is a sincere love for life in this story that is utterly compelling. Go read ""Waking the Dead"" and ""If you want to walk on water, you have to get out of the boat"", watch ""Secondhand Lions"" with your most courageous friends and the loved ones you wish would be so fearless, and then meet me for coffee in Marseille.

It is nice when a movie teaches sensitivity and kindness...rather than endless violence and selfish behaviors that most movies dole out.

The storyline is great and sustained, the acting superb - interesting to watch Osment grow up, from Forrest Gump (I think that's where I first saw him) to this. Caine and Duval are brilliant as ever. I honestly cannot find fault with this movie. The only reason I would not recommend it is if you're looking to watch something with serious action or serious romance in it... but other than that, just watch it.

It was nice to not have to mute or change the channel real fast to keep him from hearing or seeing something he does'not need to hear or see. I can't understand why the motion picture writers think that it adds anything to a movie for someone to use God's name in vain, these people WILL be sorry of it on judgment day, that is one of the TEN COMMANDMENTS Thou shall not use thy Lord Gods name in vain! I don't like to hear it & if every person on this planet watched Mel Gibson's PASSION on the Christ & know that Jesus endured that torture for each one of us, I don't think there would be so many that cursed the Lord.

I look for big things in the future for the actor that played the young Walter also.He does a very good job.The other actors in the movie also do an outstanding job.But I feel they are a bit overshadowed by Duvall & Caines magic with the camera and script.

The song was featured in the movie. Anyone know he artist/title of it? I saw SecondHand Lions on a rainy August day when we should have been at the beach and I was watching my 10 year old cousin. When decided to go to the movies, there were not many choices, so by default, as SecondHand Lions was the only film rated appropriately, we chose that. The film turned out to be an outstanding experience for both us. Fine actors, good script, dirt-bag mother- all the elements of a good story. I think I even saw a tear drop fall out of the eye of my ten year old guest when the lion met his maker. Thank you-and if anyone has details on ""I'm Proud to be from Texas"" please let this New Yorker know with a response to rocknsole@aol.com",Secondhand Lions
263,mihaela_morena-66195,"A boy is brought by his mother to spend the summer with her crazy, eccentric, old uncles living in a wrecked house in the middle of nowhere in Texas.",7,8 May 2016,"The first night is absolutely awful, the uncles do not really want him there, and when he begs his mother to take him with her, she refuses. He is told by the two old men that whenever he gets hungry, he needs to cook on his own, and if he ever needs anything, to tend for himself or better yet, get used to not having it. His room is on the upper floor of the house, full of dust, his bed raises a cloud of dust when he falls on it, worrisome and feeling abandoned. Soon though, he starts to ask these old men questions about their lives and discovers a world of heroic fights in Africa, traveling around the world, honor and courage, endless love and unseparated brotherhood.What are the memorable take aways for me:1. Sometimes, the best thing a mother can do for her child is to leave him with people who can offer the love, security, affection and be the role model she will never be able to offer. How important it is for a woman to choose the partner which can take care of her children, not abuse them.2. A lioness will always takes care and fights for her cubs, no matter what. The lioness is the mother this boy never had.3. Old people, in order to live a long life, need a strong enough reason to live for, something to strive for, something to bring value to their lives and in the lives of others, more than anything else.4. Whatever you do in your life, lead a memorable one, and die with your boots on.Words which impressed me:""Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most. That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that power and money, money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil; and I want you to remember this, that love... true love never dies. You remember that, boy. You remember that. Doesn't matter if it's true or not. You see, a man should believe in those things, because those are the things worth believing in.""",Secondhand Lions
264,theseagers-70712,Values Oriented Movie,8,18 September 2016,"When Robert Duval finishes his speech about what all young men should hear, I was truly touched...""(true) love never dies"" plus the fact that honesty, truth, loyalty and honor are the most important thins in life. This is what I have been looking for, in anyone running for high office in 2016. What a heart breaker this year has been. As for Robert Duvall, is their no role he is unable to play? Michael Caine's attempt at a West Texas accent was a great attempt one, but not nearly as good as, perhaps, Damian Lewis would have done it. I was thoroughly engaged by this movie. No profanity, no nudity or violence, not later vitiated. it can done Hollywood, without artificiality and lab conjured nonsense",Secondhand Lions
265,xxxboy,A mighty roar of approval for this movie...,10,26 October 2005,Amazing performances by all three lead actors and a twisting and turning plot makes this little gem a must see feel good family movie...The amazing acting abilities of child star Haley Joel Osment come into their own yet again (also star of movies: pay it forward & sixth sense)as you walk with him through his childhood adventure with the performances of Michael Cain and Robert Duvall being just as moving as this quirky weedy little kid melts the hearts of these two worldly men. I look forward to seeing Osment's next movies. If his performance here is anything to go by I would have to say he is quickly establishing himself as one of our best young actors in all movie making history.,Secondhand Lions

267,williamjmillsap,Fantastic,10,6 September 2019,"Cmon, Michael Cain and Robert Duvall together, add Haley Joel Osmet and you've got a definite winner. You just can't go wrong. I've seen it about seven times and I never tire of it.",Secondhand Lions
