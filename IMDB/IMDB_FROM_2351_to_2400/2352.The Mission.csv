0,MartinHafer,"A little slow, but also sad and moving.",8,16 January 2014,"""The Mission"" is based on real events--though the ending is highly fictionalized. When the story begins, a lone Jesuit priest, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), treks through the jungle in South America to try to establish a mission where one had previously failed. However, he is very successful and soon the place is filled with eager native Christians. Additionally, Father Gabriel recruits a vicious slave trader, Mendoza (Robert De Niro) to join him at the mission--and soon Mendoza is converted and becomes a member of the order. All seems great...until a treaty is suggested which will move this mission from Spanish to Portuguese territory--and the Portuguese plan of dismantling the Missions. What's next? See this film.The film is extremely beautiful and was filmed in the jungles of South America using Colombian indigenous peoples. The music, though sometimes a bit repetitive, is also quite beautiful. The only complaint I had with this very compelling film was the ending. It made it appear as if the priests stayed behind and died with the Indians when they ultimately attacked, though they didn't. They were pretty much abandoned to their fate. Very sad, very thought-provoking and well worth seeing. Just be aware that the film (especially near the beginning) is very slow and if you are looking for a nice, happy ending then you should keep looking!",The Mission
1,TheLittleSongbird,"While with its flaws, still packs a very powerful punch",8,29 May 2015,"The Mission had a lot of talent on display(Jeremy Irons, Robert DeNiro, Ennio Morricone) and fortunately doesn't waste that talent. Could it have been better than it was? Yes. Is it a good film still? Yes it is, with its best components being absolutely outstanding.What stuck out as particularly outstanding were the production values and especially Ennio Morricone's music score. The Mission's cinematography looks gorgeous and the scenery and period detail are nothing short of magnificent. It does have to be one of the best-looking films of the late-80s. Words cannot describe how truly amazing Morricone's score is here, easily ranking among his best and containing at least two of his most memorable themes. The Gabriel's Oboe theme is the most well-known theme, and justifiably, it is hauntingly beautiful, and The Falls is also justifiably famous. For me however, it was the To Earth As It Is In Heaven track that really sends shivers down the spine.In terms of writing, The Mission is a long way from flawless, but nevertheless a good deal of the script is very thoughtfully written and evokes thought and emotion for a while after. The story is mostly compelling and deeply moving emotionally, with an especially powerful final act. The subject matter is devastating enough as it is, and The Mission deals with it intelligently and movingly, while the well-meaning message resonates on an emotional level and without being too preachy. The characters, while on the whole not the well-developed in the world, are still interesting and carry the film well, none of them feeling pointless. Cardinal Altamirano is particularly well-realised. The direction acquits itself fine and The Mission is generally strongly acted.The two best performances came from Jeremy Irons and Ray McAnally. Irons brings huge amounts of heart and great sincerity, he is particularly good at the end. There his acting is heart-breaking, and even with saying little to nothing at all. McAnally is advantaged by having the most interesting character in the film, and he plays with real authority and ruthless abandon, while succeeding in giving some dimension and light and shade. Look out also for a young Liam Neeson, whose appearance read as a promising one.On the other hand, The Mission does contain some flabby pacing. This is especially true in the middle act, where it does get talky and bogged down in some heavy-handed politics. For personal tastes, too, Robert DeNiro's performance is uneven. He does have some wonderful moments, with the character's torment and emotional turmoil being very heartfelt-ly portrayed. At other points however he seemed detached to the drama and somewhat out of place, especially in some of his line delivery, which bordered on aggressive and being more at home in a Scorsese film(one line and his delivery of it reminded me of Taxi Driver and it takes one out of the period setting). Aidan Quinn also doesn't fare too badly in the acting stakes but jars a little in the setting.All in all, could have been better, but the production values, Irons, McAnally and especially the music score are enough to make the film well worth seeing; they are superb and as a result the film for all its flaws still packs a very powerful punch. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",The Mission
2,bkoganbing,What You Do Unto The Least Of My Brethren,10,8 February 2010,"It's a sad fact of life that hunter gatherer cultures even when slavery is not in the mix will always give way to societies higher up on the sociological scale. No one says its right, it just is. The Mission deals with the tragedy of such a situation in South America in the 18th century.Slavery was in the mix here however, practiced in the open by the Portugese and winked at by the Spanish where their king's writ ran. The area were concerned with in South America in 1758 is that area of the Amazon headwaters where the boundary between Brazil and Peru is not really to clear. Christianity was a both a savior and destroyer of animist Indian tribes back then in both American continents. It certainly did have as a message that their culture and beliefs were altogether wrong and have to change. But there are also numerous recorded incidents where priests and we are talking about the Catholic Church here put their lives and reputations on the line to defend these primitive societies from the evils of the civilization they were bringing.Such an admirable priest is Jeremy Irons in The Mission. He's aided and abetted by Robert DeNiro a former slaver who became a monk, renouncing civilization after killing his brother Aidan Quinn in a fight over a woman. The tribe they are working with and actually gaining trust and even some converts has been earmarked to be captured and used as slave labor over in Portugese territory.The Mission is told in flashback as Cardinal Ray McAnally is writing a report to the Pope of what is happening in South America. And in many ways what is still happening there.The Mission got seven Oscar nominations including best picture and won the Oscar in 1986 for best cinematography. The performances are some of the best that all the principal players have ever given on screen. The story is a tragic one, but with a message of hope that there are indeed people like Irons and DeNiro for whom the positive aspects of their religion is not just platitudes.The best way to see The Mission is back to back with At Play In The Fields Of The Lord which is a 20th century look at the same problem. Both films are among the best made in the past 30 years.",The Mission
3,SnoopyStyle,"Great location, Great actors, Great music",8,25 October 2014,"In 1750, Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. The Jesuits had converted many of the Guaranis. The Guaranis above the waterfalls still reject the church sending a crucified priest over the falls. Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) climbs up the falls and converts the tribe with his music. He confronts slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who is now hunting above the falls. Mendoza returns to town to find his fiancée and his brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) are now in love. In a jealous rage, he kills his brother. He is despondent and Gabriel offers him work with the Guaranis as penance. Together with Gabriel and other brothers like Fielding (Liam Neeson), they make the mission thrive. Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) arrives to decide if the church will continue to protect the missions from the slave running Portugese now that the land has been transfer from Spanish protection.The location is magnificent. The actors are terrific. And the music score from Ennio Morricone is both epic and haunting. This is an amazing historical drama. The story ends in a heart wrenching battle. Director Roland Joffé pulls together one of the best movie of the year.",The Mission
4,Horst_In_Translation,You should join these folks on their mission to the mission,6,9 August 2019,"""The Mission"" is a British/French co-production from 1986, so this one is already over 30 years old. It is mostly in the English language, but there's parts in all kinds of different languages actually, so anyway you will need subtitles for sure. Writer is Robert Bolt and he won a Golden Globe for his screenplay here, more than consolation for his work not getting in at the Oscars that time, especially as he was already a two-time Oscar winner back then. The director is Roland Joffé and as I am a pretty big fan of ""The Killing Fields"", I was curious about this one from briefly afterwards because these two are really his career-defining works, also in terms of awards recognition. These slightly over two hours we got here scored many Oscar nominations, also important ones, even if ""only"" it eventually won for cinematography. But I can see why. It sure is a visually stunning film at times. A bit of a pity neither Irons nor De Niro got in. I am actually a bit surprised De Niro got virtually no awards recognition for his turn here. Irons got more, including a Golden Globe nod, he was probably also closer to an Oscar nom. And you will also find a pretty young (not very young) Liam Neeson in the cast list in one of the biggest supporting roles. But his character, unlike the other two, was really only mostly interesting for his death scene. It is kinda telling he is surrounded by angry natives, roaring waterfalls and brutal nature, but the one thing that kills him is a bullet from the firearm of an English soldier. Anyway, now we are deep into the story here. The mission mentioned in the title is a reference to a key location of the movie, a place where South American natives are shown the privileges of Christianity, which is also good for them because they really could get away from the concept of physical abuse and slavery looming above them. This really is the main conflict. The entire film is almost like an investigation on how things will continue afterwards taking profit, superiority, human rights and more into account. Oh well, not really the entire movie. The first 30-45 minutes belong to De Niro (and also Irons actually) as he is a brutal slave trader who kills his own brother because the girl he likes prefers the latter over him. His path to redemption when joining the Christians is key to this movie and I thought he was really good. He is so strong when it comes to portryaing characters with a great deal of violence looming under the surface who still somehow have the desire to become honorable and kind citizens. The final development with how he returns to being a brute for the cause is also interesting. There was obviously no way he would survive the movie.With Irons' character it surprised me a bit more. But these two have great on-screen chemistry anyway and made me genuinely enjoy this film at times. The subject is also highly interesting I think, not only because it is based considerably on actual events. Even I as somebody who does not care too much about religion got sucked in by the subject here, maybe not as much as by Scorsese's recent Japan-themed film, but still. By the way, these two are not too different in terms of tone and style I'd say, even if they play in completely different parts of the world. And fittingly Neeson is in both of them with like 30 years in-between. But lets not drift away now. This one we have here was not great, or only on some occasions, but pretty good overall and certainly interesting with all kinds of strong performances deep down to the supporting players. I am a bit surprised critics did not like it that much. It's also inferior to the other Joffé film I mentioned earlier, but only because that one is so amazing, not because this one here is weak or anything. Glad it got a great deal of awards recognition. Another thing I liked is that because of the connection to actual events, you could never be sure how this film would unfold and I liked that a lot, even if I somewhat expected an unhappy ending. But they sure played with our expectations with the official about to decide it all obviously being moved and it felt as if he could decide in our ""heroes'"" favor, but the explanation why he didn't in the end and why he went with them to see a different mission and tribe totally made sense. So lack of realism is not a problem at all for this really good film. I think unless you really hate historic movies about foreign cultures, then you should join Joffé in his ride from Vietnam to South America here. The film felt much shorter than it actually is and that is always a good sign. Positively recommended. Also of course almost a must-see for my fellow De Niro fans. Go for it! Oh yeah, I saw this as part of a film retrospective on Morricone. Yep he did the soundtrack here, probably not too expected except he worked with De Niro on quite a few occasions, but most people think of these classic westerns first when hearing his name and rightfully so. That's all, folks. As it is not an American production I'm glad this one got so much awards recognition, also in America. See it!",The Mission
5,mark.waltz,"If this ever comes to a revival house near you, run as fast as you can to see it!",10,9 March 2017,"This is the story of atonement, the story of forgiveness, and the story of how new faith takes more drastic steps than the old faith. While it is difficult to believe Robert De Niro as a Spanish warrior, it comes to be easy as his transformation occurs. In the opening scene, he's catching natives of South America and turning them into slaves. He comes upon the Jesuit mission run by Jeremy Irons and makes it clear that he sees these natives as animals meant to serve the ""civilized"" European than be taught about Christianity. A sudden turn of events involving younger brother Aidan Quinn and his lover, Cheri Lunghi, turns De Niro into a shell of himself, and thanks to the head of the Jesuit ministry, he ends up right back where he started, in the South American jungles, aiding Irons in creating the mission. But his old cohorts become his enemies, determined to destroy the mission and make more profits with new slaves.While Irons' missionary is a peaceful man, more prepared to die than fight, conflict soon erupts between the methods of the two men now on the same side. A young Liam Neeson plays another one of the missionaries, finding that he has a combination of both men's beliefs, and in the end, they fight two wars with their enemies: the spiritual war of God where death brings honor, and the violent war of man, where the point becomes to fight regardless of the outcome and to exhaust the enemy in a world that they aren't completely prepared for. Of course, there's gorgeous jungle photography where in the opening, the natives actually send a missionary to his death, floating over a huge waterfall on a cross. It's with the power of peace through a pure soul and simple musical cords that Irons managed to get through, and that musical theme is one that will sing in your heart long after the film is over.While some of the casting made me cringe, particularly of a few of the enemies, I found that De Niro and irons really became their characters. De Niro's breakdown after a climb up a huge mountain range is extremely emotional, and as he is forgiven by the natives who obviously recognize him (but were lucky enough to escape), more emotions take over. The children, especially, are enchanting, and you'll not soon forget the one with the infectious laugh. The children become just as heroic as the adults, and if you are like me, you'll jeer at the fat obnoxious slave trader who refers to a singing native child as a trained monkey. When he keeps refusing to allow the missionaries to speak by his constant braying of ""Your eminence!"", I wanted to stand up in the middle of the movie theater and demand that he shut up. This is a film that will make you look at the evils of racism and slavery, and condemn the perpetrators to hell, unlike Irons, who obviously had the ability to forgive even under the most vile of circumstances.",The Mission
6,gavin6942,Liam Neeson,7,2 February 2016,"18th century Spanish Jesuits try to protect a remote South American Indian tribe in danger of falling under the rule of pro-slavery Portugal.""The Mission"" is based on events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, in which Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. A significant subtext is the impending Suppression of the Jesuits, of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film's narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who was once himself a Jesuit.What struck me about this film is that I watched it immediately after ""Cannibal Ferox"", another tale about Europeans / Americans going into the Amazon where the natives speak a little Portuguese. Both can be seen as anti-colonial films, though one is a period piece and the other is modern day (1981). What other messages do they share?",The Mission
7,lee_eisenberg,the history of Latin America,10,7 February 2006,"Following their success with ""The Killing Fields"", David Puttnam and Roland Joffe made ""The Mission"", about a priest (Jeremy Irons) and a slave trader (Robert DeNiro) joining up in 18th century South America to try and protect the Indians from colonizers. The movie's quality lies not only in its acting and script, but also cinematography: we get to see the incredible jungle from so many angles, that it truly overwhelms us.This is definitely one movie that you can't afford to miss(ion). Every part of it was done perfectly. The way that the scenes are laid out often play tricks with the audience. The sad part is that what it portrays really happened in the Americas. A great movie.",The Mission
8,jboothmillard,The Mission,6,4 March 2014,"I remember hearing about this film many times, especially because of the leading actor with the beard, I wondered if it a period war or something, but whatever the plot or concept I was definitely going to listen to the positive reviews and watch it, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Roland Joffé (The Killing Fields, Captivity). Basically set in 1750's, Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Golden Globe nominated Jeremy Irons) enters the South American jungle and builds a mission to convert a Guaraní community to Christianity to Christianity, they are aggressive to any strangers coming into their place, but they are captivated by the music that he plays them and allow him to stay. Mercenary Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) made his money kidnapping the natives and selling them into slavery, including to Spanish Governor Cabeza (Chuck Low), but following finding his fiancée Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi) and his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) sleeping together and killing him in a duel he spirals into depression, but Father Gabriel offers him redemption, as penance he carries heavy armour over a waterfall, and he settles eventually into the Guaraní community. The mission becomes a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaraní, and Mendoza is moved to help, he takes a vow and over time becomes a true Jesuit guided by Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson), but the missions being safe under Spanish law changes due to the Treaty of Madrid over the land in South America, the Portugese colonials will be able to enslave the natives, and former Jesuit from the Vatican, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano (BAFTA winning Ray McAnally), is sent to survey all missions and determine if they will be allowed to remain or not. Cardinal Altamirano is put under pressure by Spanish Governor Cabeza and Portuguese Governor Don Hontar (The Jury's Ronald Pickup), if he sides with the colonists the indigenous people will be made slaves, if he sides with the mission they will condemned by the Portugese and fracturing could happen within the European Catholic Church, eventually he chooses to close the mission, the Guaraní will be forced to leave, but Father Gabriel and Mendoza will defend the mission if the colonists and plantation owners will try and attack them. Father Gabriel is against military force because violence goes against his religious beliefs, but Mendoza breaks his vow and does indeed use military defence, and against the Father's wishes teaches the natives the art of war, and once again wields his sword, a Portugese and Spanish army do come to attack the mission, with Mendoza being fatally wounded, and Fielding sacrificing himself, and after trying to distract the army Gabriel, the rest of the priests and many of the Guaraní, including women and children, are gunned down, only a few escaping into the jungle. The final scene sees Cardinal Altamirano and Don Hontar meeting and acknowledging the wrongs of what has happened, they agree to work together rebuild the community, surviving young children in a canoe return to the massacre within the mission to salvage some belongings, and while they travel down the river the text of the film says that priests continue to fight for the rights of the indigenous. Also starring Sigifredo Ismare as Witch Doctor, Asuncion Ontiveros as Indian Chief, Daniel Berrigan as Sebastian, Monirak Sisowath as Ibaye and Tony Lawn as Father Provincial. Irons gives a great sincere performance as the religious trying to make positive change for the native people, De Niro is is an interesting choice as the man who makes up for his mistakes and is also passionate toward the innocent people, and young Neeson gets his good moments as well as the other priest trying to help. This is a simple enough story of religion trying to solve terrible woe for a tribes people, the music throughout the film is beautiful, the scenes in the jungle and other sights look wonderful, and the 18th Century period and events are captured well, I agree it may be flabby at small moments, but overall it is enjoyable and moving historical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Ennio Morricone, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Score, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Screenplay, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

9,ccthemovieman-1,"Lush Visuals, Score & Fascinating Story All Rolled Into One",10,23 June 2006,"The more I see this film the more I like it. First off, it has magnificent South American jungle scenery, filmed in an area that features multiple gorgeous falls. This is one of the prettiest films you will ever watch - guaranteed - and please see it on widescreen DVD. ""The Mission"" won the Oscar for Best Cinematography in 1986 and that award was well-deserved. There is just one stunning scene after another.The story is very interesting, too: a supposed true-life account what happened back in the 1700s when a few dedicated priests tried to bring Christianity to the natives. It shows what occurred when a combination of the Catholic Church and the Portugese slave-traders and politicians attempted to put a halt to their missionary. This is a drama, not an ""action film,"" but the movie has extended violent ending, and sometimes is shocking in that finale.Jeremy Irons, as the dedicated Jesuit who heads the mission, and Robert De Niro in a surprise role as the killer slave-trader-turned-repentant priest are both excellent in their leading roles. It was interesting to see a young Liam Neeson, too.To some, the story might be a bit slow I found it very involving. After several viewings, I began to fully appreciate to lush score by Ennio Morricone. This is simply one of the prettiest and classiest movies I've seen and it's highly recommended.",The Mission

Later on , join other priests (Liam Neeson) and Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who undertakes a suitable penance . The Jesuit missions were safe, because they were protected under Spanish law . Meantime , a Papal emissary Cardinal named Altamirano (Ray McAnally) is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions . After that , Jesuits attempt to save a Guarani tribe in risk of submitting under mistreat and slavery . As they are forced to defend all they have built against the Portugese aggressors at an epic final battle.The picture was well based on facts , as the Treaty of Madrid -in the year 1750 and previously treaty of Alcacovas and Tordesillas- reapportions the land in South America . The land on which the Jesuit missions were located was transferred to the Portuguese, and Portuguese law allows slavery ; then Portuguese colonials seek to enslave the natives . Following the demarcation of the new boundaries, the region of the Eastern Missions , comprising seven villages of the Jesuit remaining on the left bank of the Uruguay river was moving to Portuguese hands . This resolution, however, was more significant than might appear, while in the territories of Portugal , enslavement of indigenous people was allowed, while in the Spanish territories all Indians were subjects of freedom , so they could not be enslaved . This difference in legal status of the indigenous population, was inflamed by the Jesuits themselves, led the resistance to the Portuguese that eventually burst into the Guarani War which lasted from 1752 to 1756. However , it was origin of the motivation for the Pragmatic Sanction of 1767, by which Charles III decreed the expulsion of the Jesuits from all overseas territories. This interesting film is full of compelling drama with emotion , passion , unforgettable scenes , historical events and good feeling . It is a dramatic and intelligent portrait of a time when priests Jesuits carried out a holy mission to evangelize South American natives . This is an agreeable account of the survival of the human spirit against difficulties ; an epic portrayal of Faith , Forgiveness and Redemption . The movie is plenty of graphic , striking and memorable moments about timeless power of forgiveness and dictating a strong emotional response from the spectator , and some moments results to be really touching and moving . ¨The mission¨ by Roland Joffe , was one of his greatest hits , had Palme d'or at Cannes , a graphic monument to Portuguese oppression in South-America , but Joffe has not quite held his place at the top level . The film is set during the Jesuit Reductions, a program by which Jesuit missionaries set up missions independent of the Spanish state to teach Christianity to the natives . Thought-provoking movie with evident excitement based on original story & screenplay by prestigious Robert Bolt . This exciting picture turns out to be a breathtaking spectacle about dramatic consequences of Portuguese invasion , including deep emotions , brooding dialog and a heartbreaking final . A strong , difficult shooting , as the majority of the crew became ill with amoebic dysentery . Robert De Niro was one of the few who did not catch the illness . Many of the people who played the natives were actual native South Americans who spoke little English , they were given free reign to say whatever lines they wanted, and it is rumored that in a couple scenes they're actually cursing up a storm. Colorful as well as luxurious cinematography by Chris Menges . Sensitive and emotive score by Ennio Morricone , considered to be one of the best soundtracks of cinema history . The motion picture was very well directed by the British Roland Joffé , being realized in lush style , filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship , without leaving a trace the thought-provoking issues , in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . He is a good filmmaker mainly of epic subjects . After a long career filming for television , he made his movie debut in a big way with ¨The killing fields¨ winner of three Oscar and dealing with madness and atrocities committed by humans , Joffe's usual theme . He subsequently directed ¨Fat Man and Little Boy¨ referring to two atomic bombs dropped by America on Japan . Joffe's meagre output for the cinema makes it all the more surprising that he has turned out three splendid films and several others near-disasters such as ¨The scarlet letter¨ , ¨Vatel¨ , ¨Captivity¨, ¨You and me¨ and ¨There be dragons¨ .

11,sunwarrior13,The Mission Is A Brilliant And Excellent Film,10,28 September 2012,"The Mission is a drama about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in 18th century South America.It stars Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons together with Ray McAnally, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi and Liam Neeson. It was written by Robert Bolt and directed by Roland Joffé. The film examines the events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, when Spain ceded part of South America to Portugal, and turns this episode into an allegory for struggles of Latin America. Two European forces are on hand to win the South American natives over to imperialist ways. The plunderers want to extract riches and slaves from the New World. The missionaries, on the other hand, want to convert the Indians to Christianity and win over their souls. Mendoza is an exploiter dabbling in the slave trade. But after he kills his brother Felipe in a fit of rage, he seeks redemption and calls upon the missionaries to assist him. After repeatedly climbing a cliff with a heavy weight as penance, Mendoza finds redemption and becomes a devout missionary at a settlement run by Gabriel. The missionaries want to promote a new society in which the natives will live together in peace with the Spanish and the Portuguese. But this concept frightens the royal governors, who would rather enslave the natives than encourage peaceful coexistence between the Europeans and the Indians. They order the mission to be burned to the ground. But this event causes a rift between Gabriel, who wants to pray and pursue peaceful resistance, and Mendoza, who wants to take up arms and fight the Europeans.Featuring a majestic score by Ennio Morricone and lush Oscar-winning cinematography by Chris Menges,the Mission is shot through with piercing, haunting imagery, pictures of enduring imaginative force.Also,it is a rich and thought-provoking. It contains moving images of despair, penance, and redemption that are among the most evocative ever filmed.The performances are also great especially that of De Niro,who effective as a callous soldier who kills his own brother and then turns to a missionary to oversee his penance and conversion to the clergy. The narrative and dramatic forces at work in this movie should be more stirring and powerful than they are but unfortunately,it lacks doesn't as it is too detached for the viewer to feel concern with the events and characters in the story.But that doesn't take that much from it as it remains a brilliant and excellent film.",The Mission

13,CinemaSerf,Immersive story of tragedy and oppression.,8,25 July 2020,"The recent death of maestro Ennio Morricone prompted me to watch this again, and 35 years later it has lost one of its magnificence. Oddly enough, the plot may have more of a resonance now that it had back in 1986 when we were first introduced to ""Father Gabriel"" (an excellent Jeremy Irons), a Jesuit priest trying to introduce the sceptical local Guaraní tribe near the magnificent Iguazu Falls to Christianity. Forming an unlikely alliance with guilt-ridden, former slave-trader Robert de Niro (""Mendoza"") he sets about building his church. When the ownership of the land upon which his mission is built changes hands, Cardinal Altamirano (an outstandingly creepy Ray McAnally) arrives to adjudicate between the mission and their new Portuguese landlords - who habitually employ the locals as slaves across their empire. Needless to say, the Cardinal's decisions have little to do with ""Gabriel"" and his flock, though he does have a semblance of a conscience about it all; but largely about the grander political scheming between Rome and it's Iberian partners and I suppose the ultimate, tragic conclusion, is never really in doubt as the battle lines are gradually, but emphatically, drawn. The cinematography is, frankly, breathtaking and the senses of isolation, depravation and yet, still, optimism and hope are expertly conveyed through the visionary direction of Roland Joffé from a typically solid, detailed, story from Robert Bolt. Finally, the whole point in watching it again - the mellifluous tones of ""Gabriel's Oboe"" which is easily amongst Morricone's best work even if it did lose out to Herbie Hancock's largely forgettable ""Round Midnight"" (1986) score. If you haven't seen it, it's a must watch. If you have, it's a must see again.",The Mission
14,Boba_Fett1138,A feast for eyes and ears but flawed in its emotions.,8,25 October 2005,"""The Mission"" is without doubt a beautiful movie. The visual are absolutely stunning. Most credit for that has to go to Mother Nature. The music by Ennio Morricone is a real threat, it might very well be his best work till date in my opinion. However the movie is more style than substance. The movie is lacking the emotions it needed and the storytelling misses the point at times.I wish more movies were made about the European slave trade. Movies have become an important medium of history telling over the last couple of years. These kind of stories are important and because of that more movies about it should be made. I however feel that this particular movie misses the point at times. The movie should be about the natives and their struggle against the Portugues slave traders and how they want to contain their way of live and habitat. The movie however focuses at times a bit too much on the Jesuits instead. The movie could had really been an emotionally powerful one if we the viewers actually got to care more about the natives. The movie tries to be emotional but fails because the story is brought wrongly.Robert De Niro is really great in his role even though he doesn't get that much to do in this movie. It's a bit of a waste of a great actor. Main character of the movie is played by Jeremy Irons who also does more than great. Some smaller part are played by Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn. To be honest I wouldn't call Quinn's appearance anything more than just a cameo.I have some mixed feelings about this movie. The first- and middle part of the movie were really good and powerful however in the last 30 minutes of the movie the story concentrates on how the natives with the help of some of the Jesuits fight back against the Portogues. The first and middle halve of the movie mainly concentrated on how peaceful and beautiful the world of the natives was, it was 'On Earth As It Is In Heaven', so when the natives suddenly decide to pick up their weapons and go to battle, suddenly all of the respect and emotional bond that was build up in the first- and middle part of the movie is gone. Another example of how the storytelling of the movie is flawed. If the story was brought in a better way I would perhaps had been more shocked and saddened by the fact that the natives got slaughters along with the Jesuits. Don't get me wrong I liked the ending but it just didn't blend in very well with the rest of the movie.Still I rate this movie highly for the following reason. I judge this movie as a movie not as a history lesson, which it really could had been. As a movie it is good, despite its at times flawed storytelling. The visuals are really what makes ""The Mission"" an unforgettable and highly recommendable movie. The movie might not be as powerful but it's still interesting to watch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Mission
15,evanston_dad,Feast for the Eyes and Ears,7,6 May 2008,"Roland Joffe's period film is breathtaking to look at and listen to, but it's directed with a heavier hand than his breakout film from two years earlier, ""The Killing Fields."" I had trouble with the casting too. Jeremy Irons feels right for his role, but it's tough to accept Robert DeNiro in period films -- he's such a remarkable contemporary actor, and he's created such iconic representations of modern urban life, that he feels out of place in something like this.The film is a feast for the eyes and ears though, with Chris Menges, who had won an Oscar for photographing ""The Killing Fields"", adding a second trophy to his mantle for his work here; and Ennio Morricone providing an instantly classic score.Grade: A-",The Mission
16,Uriah43,A Slow but Powerful Film,7,27 December 2015,"""Rodrigo Mendoza"" (Robert De Niro) is a slave trader in South America who kills his own brother in a fit of jealous rage. Although he is not convicted by any court he still regrets his action and because of that he shuts himself out of society in a nearby church. Eventually, he decides to seek forgiveness by doing an extremely difficult penance. When that is finally accomplished he becomes a Jesuit monk working at a newly built mission far inside the jungle helping the same tribe he had tried to enslave. Unfortunately, time doesn't stop and all too soon other slave traders appear with the main goal of tearing down all of the missions in the area thereby ending any refuge for the unfortunate Indian tribesmen. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say this was a slow but powerful film which manages to capture the beautiful scenery of South America along with the power and greed prevalent during this particular time in history. It also won several awards including the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival along with being nominated for ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards. Again, while it's rather slow at times, it's still something worth viewing for those who might be interested in this type of film.",The Mission
17,movieman_kev,The films that SHOULD have won Oscar for Best Picture: 1987,9,9 May 2005,"In 1750 Spain, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) takes the place of a previous missionary whom was killed. He along with the help of reformed killer/slaver Mendoza (Robert DeNiro) and others hope to bring Christianity into the hearts of the natives of the land. He is successful, but when Portugal acquires the colony the question of if the missions are still under the protection of the Chuch arises. This is a powerful movie, one that I appreciated much more then Roland Joffe's previously directed ""Killing Fields"" which felt sanctimonious and one-sided. This film ,on the other hand, has breath-taking cinematography and well-developed characters. And while the film does falter in places (somewhat condescending and near the end over-preachy) the good far outweighs the bad. The Academy Awards had made yet another mis-step giving the Best Picture Oscar to ""Platton"" rather than this film.My Grade: A DVD Extras: Disk 1) Commentary by Roland Joffe; Theatrical Trailer; select Cast and crew filmographies; and list of Awards Disk 2) ""Omnibus"" (a great documentary on the movie)",The Mission
18,JamesHitchcock,How should Christians respond to evil?,9,13 March 2009,"Goldcrest Films were the most remarkable cinematic phenomenon of the eighties. They were responsible for a string of films- ""Chariots of Fire"", ""Gandhi"", ""Local Hero"", ""The Killing Fields"", ""Hope and Glory""- which not only rank among the greatest ever British films but were also much admired internationally. ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""Gandhi"" both won ""Best Picture"" Oscars, and several of their other films were nominated, including ""The Mission"".The film did not, however, perform well at the box office; possibly its theme, the Guarani War of the 1750s, was too remote to appeal to the average cinema-goer. Set in what is today Paraguay and the adjoining areas of Brazil and Argentina, it tells the story of Father Gabriel, a Spanish Jesuit, who enters the jungle to build a mission and convert the local Guaraní Indians to Christianity. The Jesuit missions of this area were largely autonomous of the Spanish state and provided the Indians some protection against Portuguese slave-traders. Gabriel is joined in his work by Rodrigo Mendoza, a former mercenary and slave-trader who has repented and become a Christian after killing his brother in a quarrel over a woman. Eventually, Mendoza becomes a Jesuit himself.The crisis comes when the Jesuit missions, which under Spanish rule enjoyed some protection, are handed over to the Portuguese under the terms of the Treaty of Madrid. A Papal emissary, Cardinal Altamirano, is sent to determine whether the missions should continue to enjoy their autonomy under Portuguese rule, or whether they should be suppressed, which will allow the new colonial masters to enslave the Guaraní. The King of Portugal, Joseph I, has come under the influence of his anti-clerical favourite, the Marquis of Pombal, who is threatening to expel the Jesuits from Portugal itself, and Altamirano believes that such an outcome can be avoided if he permits the suppression of their missions in South America.The film is notable for its sympathetic treatment of Christianity, and poses the question ""how should Christians respond to evil?"" It does not provide an easy answer, because there is no easy answer to this question. (The script was written by Robert Bolt, author of ""A Man for All Seasons"" which asks the same question in slightly different terms). The two main characters, Gabriel and Mendoza, symbolise two possible responses, Gabriel representing Christian pacifism and Mendoza the concept of the ""just war"". Mendoza the former slaver has come to detest slavery with all the zeal of the convert, and when the Portuguese send soldiers to destroy the mission he uses his military experience to lead the Guaraní in a war of resistance. Gabriel detests slavery as much as Mendoza, but he also detests war and violence, which he sees as the negation of all he has ever worked for, and refuses to fight the invaders, trying to defend the community by nonviolent means.Altamirano represents a third possible response, that of collaboration. As played by Ray McAnally, he is by no means an evil man, despite the part he plays in the destruction of the missions. He is sincerely devout, and can appreciate the worth of what Gabriel and the Jesuits are trying to do in Paraguay. His dilemma is similar to that facing many in Nazi-occupied Europe; does one collaborate with evildoers, in the hope that one can thereby mitigate their evil, or does one actively oppose them, with the risk that this might provoke them to commit even more wicked acts? Altamirano's decision is wrong, especially as the Jesuits were indeed to be expelled from Portugal about a decade after the events shown in this film, but that does not necessarily mean that the thought-processes that led him to that decision were all base ones.This was the second film to be directed by Roland Joffé, the first being ""The Killing Fields"" (also for Goldcrest). In the mid-eighties he was regarded as one of the brightest talents in the British cinema, and these two films show why. The British film industry is sometimes accused of shying away from the darker side of life, and it can certainly sometimes be parochial in its preference for films with a local setting, but these two films do not fit that stereotype at all; both are set in distant parts of the world, and both deal unsparingly with the subject of man's inhumanity. ""The Mission"", in particular, is a superb film, for a number of reasons.Firstly it deals with a serious subject in an intelligent way. Secondly, there is a great musical score from Ennio Morricone, especially the haunting theme played to the Indians by Gabriel on his oboe. (Under the title ""Gabriel's Oboe"" it has become part of the Classical repertoire). Thirdly, there is the photography of the dramatic jungle scenery, which helped win the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. (The film was actually shot in Colombia; possibly political considerations precluded filming in Paraguay itself, then still under the rule of the Stroessner dictatorship). Fourthly, there is the power and drama of the action sequences.Finally, Joffé was able to call upon some great acting, from McAnally, and from Jeremy Irons who succeeds well in conveying Gabriel's wisdom and goodness. Above all there is Robert De Niro. This is not often ranked among his greatest films, but in my view it should be. (Perhaps some of his admirers find it difficult to accept him as anything other than an American). Mendoza is a character who goes through considerable development in the course of the film, from brutal, swaggering soldier of fortune, to conscience-stricken penitent, to man of God, to desperate freedom fighter, and De Niro is never less than convincing in all of these four different incarnations. This should be ranked among the finest movies of the eighties. 9/10",The Mission

20,lasttimeisaw,The Mission: 5/10,5,25 July 2011,"Holding the prestigious fame of the Palme d'Or winner of 1986, THE MISSION to me is a structurally uneven piece whose only prerogatives are Morricone's intriguing score and DP Chris Menges' picturesque shots (deserve his Oscar winning).I don't know what the accuracy between the film and the historical event, the film failed to impress me neither in a religious aspect, nor in its moral level. I could not totally commit myself into the narrative, judging by De Niro's character Rodrigo, since killing his brother during an unexpected duel, until the redemption in the midway, the performance is paper-thin and maybe director Roland Joffé didn't intend to dig into a deeper ground to elaborate on his character, which is a common measurement here, only Ray McAnally survives as the Cardinal Aktanurabo, not an arresting role, but the late McAnally owns every scene he presents. Another leader Jeremy Irons a (the iper-pious and righteous Father Gabriel), has also been hobbled by the mindless neglects, but he excels De Niro by a notch in the course of their restrained two- hander screen-time. Furthermore, I found it rather weird of the prolonged close-ups on Rodrigo's eyes before his ultimate demise (only after witnessing Father Gabriel being dispatched, he was able to close his intrepid eyes), maybe it is intentionally edited, but I could not figure it out the motivation. I should have rated this film a bit higher than a 5/10, but I must be loyal to my true feelings, the slaughter in the latter film is a pre-AVATOR holocaust (except one waterfall scene, reminds of Meryl Streep in THE RIVER WILD 1994), maybe the influence of a tragedy is a two-edged sword, in my case, all I receive is the negative energy, and renders a feeling of factitious propaganda for the Church and the Jesuits. So, bite me if you disagree.",The Mission
21,KineticSeoul,Powerful movie about fighting for what is right or showing love and mercy,7,2 December 2011,"This is a powerful movie that questions the morals of what is right and what is wrong. In this case if it's right to fight for what is just or to try to solve everything by love and mercy. I found this movie to be slightly dry but it got my interest most of the way through. Mostly because it is based on a true story. About a man that falls and later becomes a Christian and later fights for what he believes is right instead of what he only wants. So in this case he is fighting for the peaceful tribe of Christians. I just wish the movie was a bit more developed and explain certain parts of the movie. Such as how the tribe got evangelized after the beginning scene. All the actors did a great job, in fact it has actors that will play some big roles in future movies after this. Such as Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson. This is not a movie I would watch repeatedly but it's a powerful movie that questions the morals of what is right and wrong. I personally had to agree with Robert De Niro's character in this movie. I thought the movie however ended too abruptly and a better development would have made this movie better.7.3/10",The Mission
22,ElMaruecan82,"The greatest movie about the three universal languages of the soul: faith, love and music...",10,13 November 2012,"Goethe said: ""Religious worship cannot do without music. It is one of the foremost means to work upon man with an effect of marvel."" I don't think there is a more eloquent movie moment to illustrate that statement than the scene from Roland Joffé's ""The Mission"" where the Guarani Indians find Father Gabriel (Jermeny Irons) in their territory.The previous Jesuit priest who tried to convert them ended up tied in a cross and sent to his death in the vertiginous Iguazu falls, probably the film's most spectacular and defining shot. Father Gabriel traveled to the same falls, to pursue the quest of his ill-fated predecessor. He won the hearts of the Indians through the simple use of an oboe. The Guarani, captivated by the music, couldn't believe that an instrument capable of such a divine sound would bring a bad omen for the tribe. The Guarani didn't speak Spanish, Father Gabriel didn't speak their language yet, but what are words except the language of the mind, and how useless can they be when music, the language of the soul, can be understood with no need for translations. ""The Mission"", Golden Palm winner of 1987 relates the epic South-American journey of the Jesuits in the middle of the 18th century. And much more, it's served by one of the most beautiful scores ever written from Ennio Morricone, which conveys the transcendental aspect of music as a universal language, a key for people's souls. It's true that, by depicting the martyrdom of the priests who fought for the indigenous people's right, the film can be perceived as a celebration of religion. But religion comes from 'relegere', which in Latin means 'uniting': uniting people under a same faith, even nobler because it relies on values such as love, equality and justice. It's significant that Father Gabriel doesn't convert only the Indians but also a mercenary and slaver named Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who thought himself beyond any redemption, after having killed his brother in a duel.Mendoza follows Gabriel to the Christian sanctuary, along with Father Fiedling (Liam Neeson). He pulls a heavy bundle containing his armor and sword, what's left from his previous life, and after crossing the falls and getting to the Guarani territory, Mendoza finally measures the accomplishment and finds himself among brothers. He bursts out crying, and his tears strangely mix up with the kind of smile only De Niro could make communicative and poignant in the same time. Mendoza takes vow and becomes a priest, trading his sword to a Bible. If one thing, ""The Mission"" is a hymn to universal brotherhood, and only our in our faithless era, one could take it as pro-religion film. How can it be pro-religion, when the same Guarani will end up massacred by the slavers who believed in profit, today's very religion?""The Mission"" is set during that specific time where Catholicism became the scapegoat of all the European revolutions, where the same people who justified racism or slavery blamed everything on the Church. The Guarani sanctuary would be left to the Portuguese disposal after a territory transfer and a Papal emissary, Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) a former Jesuit himself, was sent to examine the situation. Although he's amazed by the success of the Jesuit Mission, he is confronted to a dilemma: if he yields to the Spanish plantation owner Cabezo (Chuck Low), one of Mendoza's collaborators who doesn't even believe that Indians are human beings, there's no doubt that the whole tribe will be enslaved. If not, he'll create one terrible schism within the Catholic Church, as the Jesuits would have dared to interfere with the Portuguese interests , represented by Don Hortar (Ronald Pickup). The choice is obvious and so is its bloody aftermath, no one could have expected anything from Hortar or Cabezo, when the pure voice of a little Indian singing had not effect on them, even inspiring an abject comparison to savant parrots. Mendoza dealt with them, and reconsiders his Jesuit vow when he understands that only the language of weapons can fit the men, whose souls cannot be touched by the divine grace. And whether the fight is already lost doesn't matter, they all obey to a mightier authority than plantation owners or politicians. When Altamirano tries to reason Gabriel so he can reason the Indians, the Guarani leader questions his authority, isn't he representing God, and how can even God be a matter of reasoning. Only God can know where the truth lies, religion is not a democracy but at least everyone's equal under God.Naturally, the marching civilization annihilates the Guarani, just like the Conquest of the West destroyed the Natives, and like many countries, till now, use the content of their civilizations to justify the fight against religious obscurantism in the name of modernity, while maybe religion is still trying to protect some of the best of Human civilization. As the film concludes."" The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."" Faith, like music, speaks for something hidden in the soul that no one can't reach, the belief in people's inner goodness, that no one is beyond any redemption, that's what Catholicism is about, and I'm not even Catholic, but within my own religion, I can respond to a film like ""The Mission"", and that's what Ennio Morricone's music accomplishes and what makes it one of the greatest score ever made. It's too magical for words and too divine to belong to one religion.And it's so close to Heavenly perfection that any flaw, right or wrong, which a critic would find, on the editing, the storytelling or the directing, is immediately redeemed. I wouldn't believe a film capable to transport my soul with such a mesmerizing music would have anything to be criticized. I guess my reaction was similar to the Indians when they listened to the sound of Gabriel's oboe",The Mission
23,paul2001sw-1,Ambitious but flawed,6,6 April 2015,"Roland Joffe's stately film, 'The Mission', tells the story of indigenous Americans first embraced, then abandoned, by a Catholic Church more interested in power than in good. But the film has failings: there are multiple lead protagonists (including Robert de Nero whose role seems inadequate for his star billing), denying us a consistent perspective; the pace is slow; and the battle scenes at the end more confused than dramatic. I also found Enrico Morricone's story invasive and partly unnecessary. In addition, the plot can be summarised as bad stuff expected, bad stuff happens: it's a story extraordinarily devoid of twists.

It succeeds in being intelligent, intimate and full-blown, not quite in the ""Lawerence of Arabia"" class but very much in the same ballpark.The subject is the Catholic Church and the Portuguese government's treatment of the Guarani Indians in the conquest of South America. A different producer, (in this case, Lord Puttnam), and director, (Joffe, finding his feet magnificently), might have handled the material differently, filmed it in a more abrasive style befitting its subject matter, but if the film is mostly high, wide and handsome rather than dark and genuinely disturbing, you can't fault it's makers sincerity or skill in delivering the goods. It is both moving and exciting.Unfortunately, the performances don't measure up to either the subject or to the scenery with the exception of Ray MacNally's duplicitous Cardinal and Bolt's script reduces everything to black and white with no shades of grey; not so Chris Menge's luminous colour photography while Ennio Morricone's score is among his very finest.

The movie has been overlooked mostly because of it's Christian themes, but as it's about saving people and a man of the cloth, it should have these themes.This film is about how a Jesuit and a slave trader unite to save a South American tribe from relocation and other dangers.The acting is really good. Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro make a very good team thanks to great chemistry. The Indian actors are also really good as they brought a sense of realism to their lifestyle.Overall, this is a great, underrated epic that would teach some people history they did not know about. My only complaint is that the battles at the end of the film lacked effective choreography and I did not find them to be realistic.

His line ""Are you laughing at me?"" is almost a parody of his ""Are you talking to me?"" from ""Taxi Driver.""

29,Dr_Coulardeau,This will be an eternal masterpiece,10,27 September 2008,"A film that comes from so far away 22 years ago that the story, or the history, of the film is no longer important, but was it important even in 1986? Today the struggle between the two Christian kings of Portugal and of Spain on one hand, though hostile to each other when the other party is absent, and the church on the other hand, a church that is also divided between the European hierarchy that only sees the survival they have to go through in Europe by defending there their interests by sacrificing a few missions in South America. Today these details are irrelevant The Christian church or churches have long abandoned this kind of policy, particularly the Catholic church. But today the general pattern of the story, the massacre, the slaughter, the slaying of a whole Indian, local population to the sole interest of the colonial powers who try to put their hands on the riches and resources of some foreign countries, like oil in Iraq for instance is quite a familiar story. And what about that American war hero who became an American war hero in a war that killed several million people and devastated a whole country for the sole political and economic interests of one country, one country alone. Who cares in the west about the local indigenous population that gets killed by western bullets? Like The Sons of The Pioneers used to sing, ""Lie Low, Little Doggies, Lie Low on the Ground"". We are living in a world that stands upside down in two ways. It is still standing upside down if we consider normal human ethics that tells us to help the poor and the weak and to respect the goods and property of other people, particularly their national territory. And yet that world that is upside down is in the process of tilting over and then getting upside down a second time, which might bring it upside up and downside down. The champion of deregulated free market jungle economy is nationalizing most of the American banking system and is getting ready to do the same with the car industry that has been playing with bankruptcy for quite a few years now. Less state he says the candidate of the party of this president. Yet this president nationalizes all that is getting into difficult straits by their own fault, but he does not forget that public money is the property of the rich since they did not contribute much and he is trying to give them a financial bonanza for their dumb incompetence. You see the pattern. That pattern that is still alive like hell and kicking like a dumb mule. Don't worry, as usual, before the world gets back to upright many people will be killed and will die. Before Brazil got a president that is starting the reversal of that historical injustice and mistake of 1750, quite a few millions were killed or enslaved or tortured or assassinated or whatever provided death was the end of it. But this film gives you another element of that pattern. The powerful who plan to genocide you manage to present the whole matter in such a way that you have to agree to foot the bill which will hurt you or otherwise the depression that would ensue would not only hurt, it would bring humanity a few hundred million individuals down, lower and shorter. And in the back of their heads they believe that this is sustainable since for at least twenty or thirty years the overpopulation of the world will be slowed down. As these vultures would say: there is always a positive point in any negative event. But the more I try to think positively the more I stand on the side of all these priests, these Jesuits, those who fought and died fighting and those who did not fight and died trying to bring God's word down on earth. The only thing that came for all of them was bullets, bullets and more bullets. Is that pattern human, historical, or plain characteristic of one particular period? But why does it come back up so regularly through the centuries?

30,filipemanuelneto,A masterpiece,10,21 November 2016,"When Spain and Portugal colonized South America the Amerindians were the main losers. European diseases killed thousands but many more were eventually killed by new settlers. However, in Europe, intellectuals debated the possibility of Indians having souls (the certainty that black people had no soul was the excuse used to allow their slavery without remorse). Okay... for us, all this seems horrible and surreal because we learn with this mistakes and change the way we think but, at that time, this debate was very important. If it were true, then it was an universal duty to evangelize the Indians and protect them from slavery. It's in this context that Jesuit missions are founded, going against the will of the settlers, who had every interest in maintaining that source of cheap labour (keep in mind that European settlers were a minority in the new lands, despite Spain and Portugal sent millions of men there). The action of the Jesuit priests, though blessed by the Church, displeased the two empires, which saw themselves, from time to time, at war because of the exact demarcation of their frontiers in that region. And it's precisely in this historical context that the film unfolds, portraying the efforts of the priests to protect the Indians and their missions, and the governmental attempts to get them closed. Portugal, in particular, maintained in this period a bad relation with the Jesuits, that would end up being expelled from the Kingdom few years after the period portrayed in the film.The film is truly capable of humanizing all these issues, showing a human side that is often overlooked in history lessons. The merit goes to Robert Bolt, who wrote the screenplay, and to director Roland Joffé, whose efforts deserve no negative note. The film has excellent characters and a luxury cast. Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) represents very well the ideals of the Jesuits, imbued with the combative and evangelizing spirit that still characterizes this Catholic order today. Irons was totally at ease with the character and made, in this film, one of the most remarkable work of his career. Robert De Niro gave life to Don Rodrigo Mendoza, a contradictory character who begins by being one of the most active captors of Indians. His redemption, however, leads him to join the missionary effort to the point of becoming one of his most active advocates. And how interesting it was to see De Niro in a human and emotional role, in such an obvious contrast with the characters he usually represents... The film also features Ray McAnally as a cardinal sent by the pope to evaluate the complaints of the Iberian kingdoms.The shooting sites are magnificent. The film was partially shot in Iguazú Falls, in the South of Brazil, very close to the places where these dramas were felt in real life. Finally, it's necessary to mention the incomparable original soundtrack composed by Enio Morricone, still considered today one of the most emotional, touching and melodious already created for the cinema.",The Mission

I would dare say that de Niro's performance is equal in strength to similar performances like ""The Godfather"" and other classics of his brilliant carreer. The direction and photography is like I have never seen before, because of the incredibly powerful and gorgeous pictures of the thunderous waterfall. That overwhelmingly, powerfull waterfall is featured in many scenes, because it is the home of this peaceful indian tribe, which lives just above this grandiose waterfall.The Mission is a gorgeous portrait of a peaceful indigenous indian tribe which community had converted to the Christian faith because of one inspirational jesuit father played by Jeremy Irons. Robert de Niro plays a jesuit monk. Both are passionate in their beliefs and in defending this peaceful indian tribe from being conquered by the portugese military, hundreds years ago. How they fight for their beliefs and what they are prepared to sacrifice, that is the horrifying beauty of ""The Mission"".Based on a true story, unfortunately, because the portugese conquerers slaughtered that peaceful indian tribe. It is better that you know, because this movie will shake the ground beneath your feet with its revolting portrayal of the slaughter of innocent children and women.

The story itself is all but overwhelmed by the spectacular photography and my Ennio Morricone's typically overwrought music score, which at least succeeds in distracting attention away from the stiff formality of Robert Bolt's screenplay. Sincere efforts and a well-intended message ought to count for something, but the film distills complex issues into a simple slaughter of innocent women and children, with the added, condescending title reminding audiences of the continuing destruction of primitive cultures.",The Mission
34,FilmCriticLalitRao,Meaningful film with Jeremy Irons and Robert de Niro.,7,5 July 2007,"The Mission directed by Roland Joffe cannot be termed as a film which can masquerade as some kind of populist entertainment stuff. It is not at all a film which entertains in the manner most of the films do. It is a film which makes us think as to what our past history was. The important message the film gives us is the reminder that numerous wars were fought in order to attain the religious supremacy of a particular religion. Now for those who think that The Mission is not a slice of history but a movie, I would say that both the leading actors are absolutely impressive. However it is Jeremy Irons who is in full command of his acting capabilities as the priest. Robert de Niro is good too as the man who repents after killing his brother out of revenge. The amazing thing is the manner in which South American native people have acted. Watching them perform alongside Hollywood bigwigs one wonders how they have not been influenced by them. The sad part of this film is its end which might appear as pessimistic to certain viewers.",The Mission

They became the intellectual elite of the Catholic Church, adviser to the kings and queens of Europe, and involved with the forest Indians...In Roland Joffe's motion picture, their purpose is to convert and to civilize the untamed population... But while the Spanish sees the Guarani Indians as a potential converts for Christianity, the Portuguese considers them as nothing more than slave labor... Tension immediately arises among the Spaniards, the Portuguese, the Church, the Jesuits, and the Guarani...The film examines the events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, when Spain ceded part of South America to Portugal... As you may know, Portugal, eventually built a trading empire so dynamic that it would eventually push out into the Atlantic and set the stage for Spain's historic expeditions of conquest... By the Treaty, the Jesuits were to leave the New World... But neither the priests nor their flock wished to leave... There is nothing great in politics, no matter how it is delivered, and for the noble natives, the consequences are no less dramatic... The collision of cultures had it enormous consequences...

36,barnabyrudge,"Lovingly filmed, thematically powerful, literately written.... but just a bit too solemn for comfort.",7,20 February 2006,"The British film critic Leslie Halliwell said of this film ""sincere to the point of boredom"", and that's a very accurate description indeed of The Mission. It is a beautiful film, both to look at and to listen to. It tells a moving story that leaves an intentionally sour taste in the mouth. It also features strong performances and incredible location work. One would assume that in any movie where the cinematography, music, script, acting and locality all slot together so smoothly and meaningfully, the finished product would be truly extraordinary. Such thinking would certainly be true of, say, Lawrence Of Arabia. But in spite of all its strengths and its evident potential, The Mission does not reach the classic heights to which it aspires. Instead, it comes across as a good - at some stages VERY good - historical account which never quite hits a level one might call excellent. I mused long and hard whether to give this film a 7-out-of-10 or an 8-out-of-10 rank, but 9 and 10 ratings never came into the equation.In the 18th Century, in the rainforest around the modern borders of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, a tribe called the Guarani kill a missionary priest by tying him to a wooden cross and sending him over the edge of a waterfall. The priest's replacement, Jesuit Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), approaches the same tribe and wins them over with his patience, love and respect. Before long, Gabriel has converted the tribe to the ways and customs of Christianity. Father Gabriel is joined by an ex-slaver, Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro), who exiled himself after murdering his own brother in a jealous rage, and who finds a chance of redemption by joining the Jesuit order and helping to preach to the Guarani people. Soon, problems arise that threaten the Jesuit cause and the existence of the Guarani. A change in border delineation results in the Portugese acquiring the Guarani land; the Portugese refuse to acknowledge the tribe as converted Christians, viewing them as little more than animals, good for nothing but slavery. The Catholic Cardinal, Altamirano (Ray McAnally), is told to make the Jesuits leave the area and forsake the tribe. Father Gabriel and Rodrigo refuse to turn their backs on the people they have worked with - even though they themselves disagree on how best to confront the Portugese. Gabriel, a man of peace, feels that he should die with them and show them how to go honourably to their graves; Rodrigo, a man of the sword, feels that the Indians should fight to protect their mission....The film's ending is very sad and demonstrates everything that is wrong with the policies of powerful countries exploiting those less powerful than their own (a theme that is still relevant today - it seems our politicians have learned little from history). Ennio Morricone provides a stunning score which is easily his best work since the spaghetti western days, and which brings great emotion to the proceedings. Irons and De Niro give good performances as the differing Jesuits who cannot let go of their ideals even though they know they're doomed if they don't. Both are actually upstaged by McAnally, whose role as the Cardinal is by far the best in the film, exploring as it does the humanistic and moral dilemma faced by the character. The Mission is quite a heavy-going film and, like Halliwell said, it is very sincere indeed. Therefore, whilst it has its good points, it is also a hard film to watch and is more likely to appeal to those interested in the events, the period and the politics than to more generally-minded audiences.",The Mission
37,gcd70,Fine film making lacks full impact,6,31 August 2007,"Reputedly powerful film, but merely well made, about a mission in the South American jungle threatened with closure due to politics in the Vatican.Roland Joffe puts the movie together well, but still I find ""The Mission"" does not have the real impact it could have had. The cinematography is magnificent, Ennio Morricone's score is haunting to say the very least, and all the cast, including Jeremy Irons, Robert De Niro and Aiden Quinn give strong performances.

That the story isn't that great and that some things don't make much sense is too bad but there is enough here to enjoy. The cinematography of the beautiful nature is great. Every shot has something beautiful in it. The music composed by Ennio Morricone is great as well.We also have Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons with nice performances. The movie was directed by Roland Joffé who directed the great 'The Killing Fields' and he does a nice job here as well, most of the time. The fighting sequence in the end was hard to follow.

39,eric262003,Shame That The Oscars Overlooked The Actors In This 1980's Classic,8,16 November 2019,"In the 1980's, it was regarded as the most creative moment in the history of film-making in Hollywood at a time when remakes, reboots and lazy acts of recycling old stories and rehashing them as original content was virtually less commonplace than what's given to us in today's movie market. It was a time where new stories and fresh content was given to its audience and the film industry truly cared about its audience and not wasn't just making movies to leak in the money that we see nowadays. What we see in the movie industry is far cry to the care of the craftsmanship that was truly what made films of the 1980's all the more welcoming in our society.In 1986, under the director who gave us 'The Killing Fields"", Roland Joffe brings us ""The Mission"" which was nominated for seven Academy Awards including a well deserved win for the Best Cinematography Award by Chris Menges, teels the tale of 18th century Spanish Jesuit priests make it their mission to convert the Guarani Natives in South America, while the Portuguese settlers want to make the Guarani's their slaves. Well-intended Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) peacefully makes its his mission to persuade the Natives to the Catholic faith. One such recruiter is a rebellious ex slave owner and mercenary named Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who's seeking redemption after committing to the murder of own brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) over jealousy and by becoming a vigilante to the Natives after they forgave him for his evil ways in the past. He eventually joins the priesthood under the tutoring of Father Gabriel.Everything runs smoothly at first until both the Spanish and Portuguese governments intervene making a standpoint at which continents they want to make their own and what was at once a Spanish colonization has now been governed and taken over by the Portuguese which is the more of two evils for the Guarani because they'll more likely be used as slaves. This is where Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnnally) comes in as a Papal emissary who's there to figure out whether the Vatican will go with the mission or sell the Natives to the Portuguese for slavery.When I first saw it, I thought to myself the shooting locations must've hit some rough patches being that the locations were surrounded by rivers, deep forestry, and all the beauty that comes from the Amazon jungles of South America. In spite of the outer beauty, the outdoor filming can be very unpredictable and can be dangerous. But hats off to cinematographer Chris Menges for keeping the background beautiful and the setting very authentic. This is a well earned Oscar win for Menges.One can also not ignore the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. And while the soundtrack is beautiful in its delivery and has been praised by critics, I felt there were times when the score didn't fit well in some scenes in the movie. Like in the opening act, the soundtrack felt like the music would've been more suited for a thriller genre than a period piece drama. And while the music is something we could easily hum to, there are just some awkward moments where the music doesn't quite match to the emotions of certain scenes. In fact the score is so over-the-top, it awkwardly feels like a soundtrack you could hear in the cartoons. But the more tender scenes fortunately, feature more nuanced tones that one could mesmerized to.It was quite sad that the Academy Awards overlooked the performances by the cast, because each of the performers brought something to the table. Irons shows great subtlety as Father Gabriel, who feels that his mission to convert the Natives to Christianity should be handled peacefully and not for them to break their traditional ways. Likewise, Robert De Niro is wonderful as the redemptive but hot-headed Mendoza. Aside from his rebellious demeanour, De Niro also plays a very physically straining performance as during his quest for redemption, he has the complex task of walking among the muddy trails while being attached to heavy metal. Of the actors performed here, there was one who got some recognition come award season. Ray McAnnally did go on to win the Best Supporting Actor at the BAFTA awards for his role as the self-conflicted but very subtle Cardinal Altamirano.",The Mission
40,Luigi Di Pilla,A piece of our story that merits attention,7,15 February 2015,"The Mission has been recommended to me through a friend of mine. This film is based on true events about the Spanish and Portuguese colonialism in South America in the 18th century. It shows in easy way the brutal combat against the Indians. There are a few themes that gave me to think even later. For example the position of the church and the hungry idiots that wanted enlarge their power in these poor countries against every price. An historical event that in reality continues nowadays on our planet. I take with me one of the sentence heard in this movie: ""The world is so"". ""No, it is the way we did the world!"".....Robert De Niro delivered no doubt one of his best performances. Don't expect mega action show. In fact the fight scenes are executed poorly. The cinematography is also not at the top. Don't forget, it has been turned in the midst eighties.The music of Ennio Morricone was well adapted. 7/10. If you like to discover more of that time don't miss ""1492: Conquest of Paradise"" with Gérard Depardieu.",The Mission
41,bandw,Falls short,6,20 June 2009,"In 1750 the Treaty of Madrid ceded parts of the Spanish territories in Brazil to Portugal. In those territories were several independent Catholic Jesuit missions that had been established to bring Christianity to the local Guarani tribes. One such mission, the San Carlos, is presented in this film as being hugely successful, where the priest, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), has brought the Indians out of the jungle to create a near paradisaical community. The tribe lives in harmony and views its priest as the bringer of good, and adores him--smiles and warm feelings all round. This is the first problem I had with the film. Any clash of cultures is bound to create frictions; indeed at the beginning of this movie the very Indians that Father Gabriel has so won over had strapped their previous priest to a cross and sent him to his death by setting him afloat above falls some 200 feet high. It was not clear to me what special talents Father Gabriel had that would not only reverse the existing animosities but endear him to the tribe to the extent that he was venerated.Officially the Spanish disallowed slavery whereas the Portugese used slave labor to help build their empire (in actual fact both countries were complicit in the practice). Anyway, the transfer of the mission territories to the Portugese ""freed"" the Indians to become slaves. But the Catholic Church had a say in what should become of the missions and Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) was sent to resolve the issue. In some ways Altamirano was a tragic figure: while he was encouraged by the Church to close the missions in order to stay in the good graces of Spain and Portugal (as well as to suppress the Jesuit order that the Church felt was becoming too powerful and independent), his sympathies lay with the missions and their priests. After having made his decision, one of Altamirano's aids remarked, ""We must work in the world, your eminence. The world is thus,"" to which Altamirano responded, ""No, thus have we made the world... thus have I made it."" The most interesting parts of the movie involve the political manoeuvrings between Spain, Portugal, and the Catholic Church--in particular I found it interesting to see how deeply enmeshed in politics the Church was at the time.Jeremy Irons is well cast as Father Gabriel, ably encompassing a range of gentleness, sternness, and passionate devotion. Robert De Niro turns in a surprisingly weak performance; a scene that has him transform from tears to joy is embarrassing to watch. Apparently De Niro doesn't do weeping or fake joy well. Anyone hoping that the scenes between Irons and De Niro would be exceptional will be disappointed. The real standout in the acting department is Ray McAnally as Cardinal Altamirano--he has some of the best dialog and is able to communicate the anguish the Cardinal experiences in making his difficult decision. Many things just don't make sense. The San Carlos Mission is located above the falls and an initial scene that has Father Gabriel traveling to the mission shows him to be an expert rock climber--he is seen scaling a vertical rock wall and we are forced to watch the first of the obligatory, ""I'm slipping and I may fall to my death"" scenes. Shortly after Father Gabriel's trip to the mission De Niro, who is a slave trader at the beginning of the film, is seen riding into the town below the falls on horseback (with much fanfare) with about a dozen Indians in tow, both on foot and on horseback. Since De Niro was seen poaching Indians above the falls, I assumed that the Indians he had captured came from above the falls, but are all people in the area world-class rock climbers? Can horses scale vertical cliffs? Leaving that aside, how did De Niro, acting alone, capture over a dozen Indians? The Portugese soldiers are seen scaling the vertical cliffs, but others seem to pop up at the mission when it is convenient to have them there--even the good Cardinal winds up at San Carlos, and for sure he was no expert rock climber. I never had a good idea of the local topography. Confusion is a common reaction; it was never clear to me who some of the characters were, and the final battle scenes are totally chaotic.De Niro does penance for killing his brother in a duel by carrying a bagful of heavy armor up to the San Carlos Mission. That whole sequence is so tedious and prolonged that I began to think I was being asked to share in his misery. I kept saying to myself, ""I've paid my penance, let's move on.""This film is advertised as a true story but it would more accurately be described as being loosely based on historical facts.As universally agreed, the film has scenes of stunning natural beauty, being filmed in part at the Iguazu Falls and in the jungles of Columbia. While these beautifully filmed scenes alone make the movie worth seeing, a drama should be more than a travelogue. Ennio Morricone's score is memorable, but I found it intrusive on occasion.""The Mission"" had ample material for the making of a great movie, but its lack of narrative focus and inability to involve you emotionally causes it to fall short. For a more powerful movie that treats the same theme of a priest entering virgin territory to convert native Indians to Christianity, see the wonderful ""Black Robe."" For a transfixing experience concerning early Conquistador forays into South America (accomapnied by a priest) see ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God.""",The Mission
42,marcin_kukuczka,"Final Victory in Might or in Love? Unique, profound, unforgettable movie",10,9 July 2006,"Father Gabriel: ""If might is right, then Love has no place in this world...""The movie by Roland Joffe was not popular in my country when it was released since such movies were censored by the communists. When, however, the situation changed in 1989, I remember that I saw THE MISSION for the first time on Polish TV in 1995 as a part of cinema's 100th anniversary celebration. The movie moved me so much that I have come back to it several times since then. Each time I see it, I find something new in the film. Therefore, I consider THE MISSION one of the very best films ever made, a film where history meets single individuals, where sadness is conquered by joy and disbelief and skepticism by profound thoughts on humanity.The content of the film, though historical, applies perfectly to modern times. The universal struggle of two spirits, the one of might and the one of Love, has always been noticeable wherever and whenever people live. Let us look briefly at the gist of the content: the Jesuits build a mission in the core of a jungle in South America, they understand the heart of the Gospels: Love without looking for reward. Yet, the politics of the conquerors (Spaniards and the Portuguese) steps in and destroys the mission... However, not everything dies even though goodness seems to be conquered... This story, presented here in a condensed way but developed in the film is so powerful that it leads to reflections: what, in fact, reigns in our lives; why good people have to suffer, why we are forced to do what we hate, it is so effortless to destroy while to build requires so much strength, why the world turns our good deeds into evil, etc. This aspect is the pearl of the film and the feast for the soul even though such thoughts require some courage from an individual. I reflected on the fact if I am willing to support the weak or if I rather choose might which is my master I attempt at in my actions? It's strange but we will never get to know our personalities completely... And that is what the film also shows. Altamiro (Ray Mc Anally), for instance, is a person of different psychological states hard to evaluate.The performances are exceptionally powerful which makes THE MISSION a very nice piece of film art. Jeremy Irons gives a very powerful performance as Father Gabriel expressing all values a good Christian should own: goodness, gentleness, patience, courage, and purity. He has this blink in his eyes that makes his portrayal particularly memorable. Robert De Niro... I would say frankly that this is his very best acting. People concentrate on different films when they hear of De Niro's performances, particularly in Michael Cimino's THE DEER HUNTER (1978) or in Martin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR (1991). Some of them skip THE MISSION. Yet his portrayal of Rodrigo Mendoza is a masterpiece in its own. This role is difficult to portray since Mendoza is a man of two contradictory spirits: from a slave trader to the devoted Jesuit. Nevertheless, De Niro does a marvelous job. One moment caught my attention from the first view of the film: Mendoza's death and this nostalgic look at Jesus in the Eucharist (even while writing about this moment a tear appears unintentionally in the eye). Ray McAnnally portrays Altamiro, a bishop who is forced to do what he actually does not intend to. He seems to be touched by the mission and in spite of that, he finally allows for slaughters. In the final shot, he expresses one thing powerfully: a face of a man whose conscience will forever suffer. ""Thus we have made the world...thus have I made it,"" which are his words said at the end by him clearly show what kind of person he was.Another powerful aspect of the film is music. Ennio Morricone is famous for having written music to many films but here, in THE MISSION, he did something absolutely sublime. I bought a CD listening to music alone and it was an unforgettable experience for me. People who heard it and did not see the film asked me where I got such wonderful tunes. Indian rhythms combined with Christian spirituality and ecclesiastic chorus - UNFORGETTABLE! I promise you that having seen this film, you will never forget, among other things, these lovely tunes.The filming locations, which obviously constitute an additional aspect in any film, add a thrill and authenticity to everything. It is hard to imagine other places in THE MISSION. The movie is shot mostly in the places where the historical events took place. We see the mighty Iguazu waterfalls, the jungle where Guarani Indians live, the city of Cartagena in Colombia as well as the hills of the Brazil-Argentinian border.What more is there to say? I think that most readers will agree with me that THE MISSION is a masterpiece, a film that opens people to new horizons of understanding the profound thoughts that are there in our lives if we are willing to reflect on them or not. Speaking religiously, Christ has once died on the Cross but then all was conquered by Love.The final scene gives an answer to Father Gabriel's thought that I entailed at the beginning. A silent sunny day in the jungle... we see a small group of Indian children who have survived the destruction. A little girl picks up a violin that she finds in the river and they begin to row a small boat towards the future... Father Gabriel, you are right. It seems that Love perhaps has no place in this world and might may seem to be right but it is always Love that wins since ""the spirit of the dead will survive in the memory of the living.""",The Mission
43,dglink,Morricone Makes a Good Film into a Seemingly Great One,9,17 February 2007,"Producer David Puttnam evidently has a gift for selecting composers that can lift good films to the status of seemingly great ones. In 1981, Puttnam hired the Greek composer Vangelis to write the score for a low budget film about two obscure athletes who competed in the 1924 Olympic Games. The resulting score, which was the most memorable attribute of the film, catapulted ""Chariots of Fire"" to a Best Picture Academy Award. A half-dozen years later, Puttnam selected the great Italian composer Ennio Morricone to pen the score for a high-minded film about the Church-sanctioned abuses of indigenous people in 18th-century South America. The result was a magnificent musical work that not only enhanced ""The Mission,"" but remains as one of the finest scores ever written for a motion picture. However, like ""Chariots of Fire,"" Roland Joffe's ""The Mission"" without its music would be less impressive.While Chris Menges's beautiful cinematography of Iguazu Falls and the South American jungles makes every frame suitable for a National Geographic centerfold, the tale of two men with conflicting moral centers often plods under the weight of its importance, which is written with a capital ""I."" Although Robert Bolt wrote the script with obvious conviction and feeling for the injustices doled out by the Spanish and Portuguese conquerors, good intentions do not always hold the audience's attention. The man of flesh, who is intensely played by Robert De Niro, struggles with his conversion from bloody soldier to submissive Jesuit. Meanwhile, the man of spirit, equally well delineated by Jeremy Irons, ponders the hypocrisy of his Church, which seems to put politics and greed above spirituality and souls. Unfortunately, when Morricone's soaring music is not swelling through the speakers, inner struggles with guilt, penance, and the meaning of life do not make compelling cinema.However, patient viewers who can immerse themselves in the music and the painterly images on screen may find ""The Mission"" a moving experience that will leave them angry with the fate of the indigenous peoples who still struggle to hold onto their culture. One character rhetorically asks if these people would not have preferred that the Europeans had never arrived. Although ""The Mission"" is less than the sum of its parts, the film is nevertheless worth seeing for its fine performances, stunning photography, and, above all, unrivaled music.",The Mission
44,adamscastlevania2,Better than average historical epic,6,13 April 2015,"(59%) A lesser well known/regarded big sweeping epic of the past 30 years starring a typically on-form Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro. This is very much a film that opens much stronger than it ends, with brilliant shots of the deep rainforest and a unfussy plot that does a real great job in drawing in interest. Once the mid-section begins to slot into place a lot of the momentum starts to weaken somewhat as 18th century politics takes over, but with that said it doesn't ruin the film by any means as the final few scenes wrap the film up well.

45,gbheron,The Story Is Not Fully Developed,7,15 September 2002,"""The Mission"" is a lush movie, shot on location in the jungles of Argentina and Colombia. It is set in 18th century Amazonia as the European colonial empire relentlessly moves into the heretofore-unexploited jungle. The Spanish Jesuits are the first Europeans on the scene, and have developed a benign relationship with the aboriginal inhabitants. The imperialists on the other hand want to enslave the Indians and exploit the jungle. The Catholic Church who has sent an emissary from the Vatican will resolve the conflict. Jeremy Irons plays a good-hearted Jesuit, and Robert DeNiro plays a slave trader, who suffers an epiphany after slaying his brother in a rage.   
Sadly, the story is never fully developed, and the inherent conflicts are not exploited. The movie becomes just a pastiche of related scenes lacking a strong narrative theme and supporting characters to tie them together. The story is subsumed by propaganda.  Granted, these are extraordinarily beautiful scenes, but breathtaking scenery is not enough. It feels more like a History Channel lecture than a character-driven story. I'd only recommend it if you have interest in the subject matter, jungle beauty, or one of the actors.",The Mission
46,gab-14712,Criminally Underrated Beauty!,9,8 September 2020,"I must be one of the only people that truly believe The Mission is a great movie. Do not get me wrong as the film got solid reviews and was a big player during awards season, but I do not believe it got the true recognition it deserves. This movie is a passionate, fiery film about religion and imperialism. It comes as no surprise that Roland Joffe is the man behind the camera as he tackled the likewise passionate The Killing Fields. The film expresses some important ideas within the historic background. As an avid student of history, the entire Jesuit history in South America perked interest in me. To me, it comes as no surprise that the film is powerfully directed by Joffe with two outstanding performances from Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons.The film was written by Robert Bolt. I really liked how Bolt decided to tell this story. The story is mostly told in flashbacks through a series of letters. This could have easily gone astray but Bolt kept everything on track and made the story believable. His screenplay was able to bring the history to the screen. By that, I mean that he was able to bring forth the differences between the imperialist slave traders who wanted to use the natives and their lands for riches and slaves, while the Jesuits believe they can turn the natives, the Guarani, into peaceful Christians. The story was based on the Treaty of Madrid which in 1750, Spain ceded some South American territory to the Portuguese who wanted to use the natives for slavery which Spain had abolished at the time. Interesting stuff!You cannot talk about the movie without talking about Ennio Morricone's score, which is definitely a gift from heaven itself. Talk about getting emotional multiple times during the movie. Thank you, Ennio! From ""Gabriel's Oboe"" to the haunting choir rendition of ""Ave Maria,"" this is one of the best scores of all time. Also, Chris Menges's Oscar-winning cinematography. Even though the movie was released in 1986, his views of the South American jungles are stunning. Maybe its that waterfall, but this could make a good travel movie in terms of location as it was filmed in Brazil and Argentina.The film centers around Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), a missionary whose goal is to transform the native Guarani into Christians. It is hard work for him considering they deeply mistrust white men in general for their thieving and murdering ways. Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) is an unlikely addition to the mission as he seeks redemption from the tragic death of his half-brother. The arrival of Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) spells trouble when he brings news that the land is now Portugal's and they want to enslave the natives. Mendoza, a former slaver, wants to fight back with armed rebellion but Gabriel believes in the power of prayer. Can these two men put aside their differences in order to save the mission?The performances from the two men are nothing short of excellent. Robert De Niro is awesome as usual and I loved his headstrong, emotional performance. That said, this is Jeremy Irons's movie. He nailed it as the priest. This is actually one of those performances that will convince people to become a priest...or at least help people that are in need. His final scenes are powerful and will never leave my mind. Any Liam Neeson or Aidan Quinn fans reading this? If so, keep your eyes peeled!Overall, I believe The Mission to be a great movie. If I had to make a complaint, the battle scenes can be confusing because the editing is choppy at certain points. Regardless, I loved the message this movie relayed. It is a complicated story thematically with different ideas about religion and colonialism. It also talks about a sad history that I am positive not many people know about. Joffe's sure-handed and fiery direction, Irons's godly performance, and Morricone's triumphant score make this film an emotional must-see.My Grade: A",The Mission
47,juliankennedy23,The Mission... If you choose to accept it... watch this movie.,9,17 November 2009,"The Mission: 9 out of 10: Films about faith often fail. They tend to be preachy dry affairs starring Kirk Cameron as a man who is addicted to online porn, until he finds God and smashes the evil computer with a baseball bat because apparently he has joined the Taliban or something. Most “Christain” films are designed simply reinforce the prejudices of a limited choir.Critically acclaimed “serious” films are also often fairly dry affairs, interested more in being “good “ rather than being entertaining. They tend to beat a visual and narrative dead horse rather than entertain for the sake of entertaining.The Mission is a critically acclaimed movie about faith... and I loved it.I had avoided the film for twenty years as if it was an “A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius”. It turns out to be a dynamic, action packed affair, starring Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons and a very young Liam Neelson.It is a movie about faith. In fact, it is one of the most moving and effect movies about the purpose of faith and redemption I have ever seen. It is also about the historical pact between Spain and Portugal (Treaty of Madrid) and the war on both the natives of the jungle and the powerful Jesuits who protect them.The movie is told in flashback with a Papal emissary (the excellent Ray McAnally) telling the tale and his tragic role in shaping it. The visuals are often simply amazing and the score by Ennio Morricone is considered one of the best of all time. Some critics felt the war scenes at the end muddled but I feel this reflects on the nature of battle and at the very least, this viewer had no trouble following it.One side note the film contains a lot of nudity including some rather shocking child nudity. Since the film is rated PG, one must assume the ratings board used the National Geographic rules in their assessment.There I go praising the film no doubt scaring off viewers that are afraid it will be “good.” It is, but it is also entertaining with great action, visuals and top notch actors.",The Mission

51,mario_c,To fight for a cause in a time of slavery and greed,7,10 February 2013,"THE MISSION is a history drama about the expulsion of the Jesuits' missions in South America in the middle of the XVIII century. By what I've learned the plot's background is accurate to history and all we see in this movie truly happened in real life, unfortunately! The search for slavery work was continuous at the time by Portuguese colonists and the Spanish in spite of slavery not being directly allowed by their crown they also used the indigenous slaves. The Spaniards which had been creating Indian reductions since the middle of the XVI century, as a form to convert and control those indigenous people, were followed by the Portuguese, and both built Jesuit reductions in their territories. But after the 1750 treatment the Jesuits would be expulsed because they refused to leave their missions where their lived together with the indians, in peace. And the indians themselves they didn't want to abandon the reductions too because they knew that in the main jungle they would be an easy target to slave traders (known as ""bandeirantes"" in Portuguese colony). So it's just the main plot's topic of this movie which then focus on the personal story of father Gabriel (played by Jeremy Irons), a Jesuit missionary, and Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert de Niro) a former slave trader which was converted to the Christian faith (and to the Jesuits) after kill his brother (because of a woman). The movie has good moments, especially in the last hour, and it describes very well the feeling of injustice and desperation those native people felt by the furious anger of the greedy imperialist armies! There're a few scenes, which focus the sad and empty native children' eyes, that worth more than a thousand words! I enjoyed this movie and the plot's main topic which portrays a sad period of our history (unfortunately empires were always built under massacres and the subjugation of other people, and I know Portuguese empire was no exception!).",The Mission
52,jdkraus,An earthly paradise,7,10 February 2008,"""The Mission"" is a movie about the events between Spain and Portugal in the 1750s. There's much at stake as one country rules the South American colonies with the purpose to convert the natives and make peace while the other has the view of slave laboring and genocide. They decide to make an agreement; the Spanish sells the colony to the Portuguese putting many natives' lives in danger.Two character's are thrown into the mist of it, a Jesuit priest (Jeremy Irons) whose in construction of building a mission with the natives and a Spanish mercenary (Robert De Niro) who seeks freedom from his past sins. The story contains many controversial topics such as: redemption, salvation, forgiveness, murder, discrimination, peace, and war.The story in my opinion was overall decent, but pretty much anything I have seen, such as: The Last Samurai and Dances with Wolves. Robert De Niro in my opinion is no more than the action hero. I love De Niro's work, but his role in this was nothing as grand as some of his other works with director Martin Scorsese.The real genius was Jeremy Irons. I have only seen him in a handful of movies, but this is by far the one he gave the best performance for. One of the most compelling scenes I found in the whole movie was when he first encounters the natives. He gets surrounded by an army of angry Indians; instead of retaliating he sits calmly on a rock and plays a beautiful tune with his flute, leaving his audience bewildered and tamed from seeking his blood.But the main reason why I give this movie a 9 out of 10 was from its captivating film-making. The shots from the beginning of the waterfalls to the ending passage on the river were amazing. The cinematography by Chris Menges (who won an Oscar for the film) was far by excellent, adding a heavenly feel to the atmosphere. In addition, Ennio Morricone's score not only supported this beautiful vision of an earthly paradise, but it also made it feel real. How he did not get an Oscar for this, is beyond me. I felt like I was pulled into the film, as if I was there. Taking my eyes off the screen was nearly impossible. This is not my favorite film, but it is certainly a wonderful one.",The Mission
53,khatcher-2,One of the great epic historical films of all time,9,27 May 2001,"In `The Mission' Roland Joffé has succeeded in putting together one of the most majestic visual adventures of all time: and a story that had to be told. Chris Menges' sumptuous photography is a feast, such that  for once  the Newsweek quotation on the video cover is superbly apt: `a sweeping spectacle'. The whole film is breathtaking: from the depths of the jungle to the indian villages, from face close-ups to broad panoramas, the visual effects are so powerful that I just cannot think of any other comparable film. Add to that fine interpretations, carefully considered and delivered performances by all concerned with Joffé's exquisite direction, and you have a guarantee of a magnificent production. But that is NOT all there is to this great film: Ennio Morricone's music reaches its greatest power, its most poignant intensity, its most gratifying melodic line, right here in `The Mission', surpassing everything this Italian composer had ever done before  even with his great friend, Sergio Leone. Here Morricone reaches symphonic levels in a wealth of melodic harmonies, such that what is supposedly `only' a visual attraction  a film  becomes also a delight to the ears, bringing a lump to my throat at various moments through this genuinely mighty film. You might wish to compare this film with `1492: a Conquest of Paradise' (1992) in which the best of Vangelis can be heard; but even so, I rate `The Mission' just ahead of `1492'. Both films highly recommendable.",The Mission
54,Eumenides_0,Spiritual,9,13 January 2012,"Imagine a time when two empires could split the world in two, one half for each country to rule, as if the globe were an orange. This in fact happened in 1494, with the Treaty of Tordesillas, mediated by the Vatican, in which Portugal and Spain, then world empires, agreed to split the newly discovered territories outside Europe along a line of longitude. This treaty gave Spain control of most of South America, with the exception of Brazil, which Portugal kept. Then in the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, Spain agreed to give Portugal the territories west of Brazil, encompassing what is today the country's territory. With two world empires deciding the fate of colonies as if they were lifeless pieces on a chessboard, it's no surprise that a lot of people ended up suffering the consequences. The Mission is the movie about those people.The movie follows the lives of three people: Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), a Jesuit missionary who goes to live with the Guaraní tribes in the Amazonian jungles to convert them to Christianity but defends their right to self-rule; Rodrigo Mendonza (Robert DeNiro), a slave trader in search of redemption for the murder of his brother; and Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally), a Vatican envoy. He comes when Father Gabriel asks the Vatican to protect the Spanish missions established in the territories. These missions have prospered and are examples of Christian communities. Transferring them to Portuguese territories would destroy them, since under Portuguese law slavery was allowed and the Guaraní would serve as a cheap labour force. Altamirano, although humbled and marvelled by the achievements of the converted Guaraní, who have constructed churches capable of competing with their European cousins, is forced by duty to decide in favour of the Portuguese, in the name of the good relationships between the Vatican and the European powers. The film concludes with a dramatisation of the Guaraní War, in which the tribes resisted the invaders until joint Spanish-Portuguese forces crushed them in a bloody massacre.If for nothing else, I love this for having given Ennio Morricone the opportunity to compose the most beautiful film score in the history of cinema. Is it strange to admit I only saw this movie because of the score? The truth is, many movies I only watch to listen to their scores. As an avid film score collector, I listen to most scores well in advance of watching the movies. Every once in a while I listen to one that makes me think, ""Well, this is really great! Let's see how it works in context. Maybe the movie didn't butcher it too much."" Well, the movie didn't butcher this one. Maybe the score is just too magnificent for that. In any case, the moment the first notes of ""Falls"" are heard, in tandem with the crushing sound of an Amazonian waterfall, it becomes obvious Roland Joffé understood how to put the score at the service of the story.This interest in the music isn't redundant. The Mission is a movie driven by sounds, music and images. It's not a traditional movie driven by plot or even characters, although I find the trio well developed, especially where their moral consciousnesses are concerned. Robert Bolt, the two-time Oscar-winning screenwriter of Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and A Man for all Seasons, wrote the screenplay, his final one. Bolt, a renowned playwright in his own right, at the age of 61, was still experimenting with his style. Sergio Leone-like minimalist dialogues is not something one associates with the poetic, fast-paced witty dialogues of ""Lawrence"" and ""Seasons,"" but Bolt managed to write a very visual screenplay, very different from his previous masterpieces, where actions define characters more than witty words.Consider for instance the character of Rodrigo Mendoza. Catching his brother with his wife, he kills him in a fit of rage. Then he delivers himself to the authorities. When Father Gabriel meets him in prison, he's a dejected, broken human being. Gabriel offers him the possibility of atonement, to work with him in the missions, where he can help those he once exploited. How does Rodrigo show his penance? Well, the easy way out would be for a tear-jerking speech full of wise, clichéd truths (and if someone could pull that off, that person would be Bolt). In the movie, however, Rodrigo travels with Gabriel back to the mission. It's a journey that takes weeks, through thick jungles, mountainous terrain, and up waterfalls. Rodrigo has tied around his waist a net containing his heavy armour, symbol of his former live. It's the burden he carries. It delays everyone, but he stubbornly pushes it after him. It falls, he goes back for it. And when he arrives, at the end of this unforgettable sequence, at the mission, an Indian cuts off the rope and throws it into a river. Then Rodrigo breaks down crying in a mixture of sadness, relief and joy his new life beginning.Wordless sequences such as this wouldn't be half as powerful, however, without seasoned director of photography Chris Menges helming the camera. For his work on the movie, he won an Oscar. He had previously won one for The Killing Fields.Back in the '80s, The Mission was part of a short-termed interest in South America: the interference of the US government in the continent, reflected on its open support for dictatorships, was becoming more and more evident. However, whereas most movies, like Salvador and Under Fire, dealt with contemporary events, few tried to show the origins of these conflicts in their historical context as the results of centuries of European colonialism. Only The Mission and Alex Cox's Walker took a different path, exploring the past to better explain what was going on in the present. As such, the movie is not just a fine period drama but a sensitive history lesson too.",The Mission
55,cinematic_aficionado,A cinematic achievement,8,8 June 2004,"The Mission is a film that stands out.It is a very good film, and what I like about it is the fact that it there is so much power in it, of emotions and characters that it is displayed brilliantly mild.You get fanatic imperialists who will stop at nothing to get what they want, oppressed locals with nothing to lose, a dedicated priest who puts the work of god above all, and a born fighter and rebel who even though tries to supress it he cannot escape what he really is.All these characters blend in a very emotional and powerful film that has a lot to tell.",The Mission

I cannot recommend this film to anyone, its obviously an overlong mess, with little redeeming value.  *1/2 out of ****, or 3.6/10.",The Mission
57,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Limited, lacking, listless",5,6 October 2006,"But then, I have always had great difficulty with films that religiously subscribe to the 'style over substance' formula. Joffe's The Mission (1986) is no different from the usual unremarkable visual fares. All cinematography and no story. In fact, the film goes to great lengths to place any aspect before story  be it gorgeous nature visuals of the setting, classical musical score or actors. The latter is the most heavyweight weapon in its arsenal and it boasts of Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn... all of whom are ultimately unable to elevate The Mission above generic 'visual film' formula.It follows then that we have here an endless tirade of shots of trees blowing in the wind, pouring waterfalls off rocky cliffs, lush damp jungle air and, above all, long introspective images of Native Indians. If you have ever seen Malick's The New World  another fatal 'style over substance' self-indulgence dribble about settlers coming across a Native population  you know exactly what this film is like. Thankfully, it has slightly more substance when you scratch the visual-laden surface and it is more strongly acted by its leads. Nevertheless, expect the same kind of lofty narrative, lack of focus in dawdling nature visuals and SAME COMPLETE LACK OF ANY TEMPLATE STORY.There is, however, one scene that has remained with me from the film. This is Jeremy Irons embracing a crying, kneeling and broken Robert De Niro in the midst of the junglefloor, while the warm breath from the murky brown river gives rich to a tense, beautiful atmosphere. This is regrettably as poignant as it allows itself to get because a minute later it zooms back into listless wandering with the camera and falls apart once again. It simply loses itself in its own self-indulgence of nature portrayals and the Native civilisation, which is not nearly as fascinating or mesmerizing as the film tries to have you believe. Sure, it's pretty; it's picturesque  but what else?I set out to watch The Mission for its triumvirate of fantastic actors (Irons, De Niro, Neeson) but was offered no showcase for any of their acting abilities. Although it was quite interesting to see a young very Oirish-looking Liam whenever his character was squeezed in between the thin nature visuals. It needs to be said that this is not an unwatchable film unless you have a short attention-span and demand non-stop action. It does, however, need to be said that The Mission is not a poignant or remarkable film and it manages merely competent.5 out of 10",The Mission
58,roghache,Poignant and inspiring epic tale of a Jesuit mission to the Guarani,9,6 March 2006,"This is an incredible film...historical tale, religious experience, character study, and disturbing depiction of native peoples' abuse at the hands of their European masters. I've forgotten some of the details as I only saw the movie once when it was first released, but its basic themes & main characters have stayed fresh in my mind all these years, particularly the sense of awe I felt upon leaving the theatre following the dramatic closing scenes.Set in the mid 18th Century, the story revolves around Father Gabriel, a Jesuit priest and missionary, who travels to the South American wilderness, establishing an evangelizing mission to convert the native Guarani peoples to Christianity and teach them certain aspects of European civilization. The Spanish soldiers attempt to thwart his efforts, especially the mercenary slave trader, Rodrigo Mendoza, who views these natives only as savages & chattels. Mendoza later experiences personal redemption following the murder of his own brother and joins Father Gabriel as a priest, working at the mission. When Spain cedes the colony to Portugal, both men must work to defend their mission against the brutal Portuguese aggressors who seek to enslave the natives. Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro are both magnificent in their respective roles as Father Gabriel and Rodrogo Mendoza. The film contrasts these two very different men and their polar opposite approaches to the threatening Portuguese. Father Gabriel (Irons) is a thoughtful man who advocates peaceful means (prayer and hymns), in keeping with the Jesuits' belief in nonviolence. On the other hand, Mendoza (De Niro) takes a more direct and violent approach with armed resistance, guns & bloodshed. Earlier in the film, Mendoza's personal experiences in seeking forgiveness for his brother's murder are also dramatically captured, as he is converted from heartless mercenary to benevolent priest. Gabriel is consistently a kind, selfless, & incredible pillar of faith throughout this story.The events are based on the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, where Spain transfered part of South America to Portugal. Spain and the Papacy apparently showed no concern regarding the plight of these Guarani, certain to elicit a sense of outrage in the viewer. However, the Jesuits at this mission are both devout in their faith and dedicated in their service to these natives.The South American scenery is utterly spectacular, the Oscar winning cinematography superb, and the music & costuming perfect. However, the compelling aspects of this magnificent film are the character portrayals of Father Gabriel & Mendoza, the sacrifices these Jesuits are prepared to make for this mission, the beauty of the peaceful native Guarani people, the abundant symbolism, the sense of grave injustice that these South American natives are nothing more than helpless pawns to European politicking, and the brutal atrocities to which they are subjected at the hands of the encroaching Portuguese. This movie is a masterpiece...a tragic, poignant, & heart wrenching, yet ultimately uplifting epic tale that is certain to remain with you for years. It is amazing viewing for anyone, but especially inspiring for people of faith.",The Mission
59,steiner-sam,"The scenery is spectacular, the music is amazing, and I needed multiple Kleenex",9,4 June 2021,"A British film set around 1750 and directed by Roland Joffé. It received mixed reviews when released and was a commercial failure. At the same time, it had a significant number of Academy Award nominations. Frankly, it was was one of the most moving films I had ever seen when I saw it initially at the time of its release, and this was reinforced when I watched it recently. Part of its impact on me was because of its religious themes, and the respect it showed both the Jesuit missionaries in the story as well as the Guaraní People they approached.Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) is a Jesuit priest based in Asunción who establishes, after great difficulty, a new mission among the Guarani People living above the Iguazu Falls. The land has been under the control of Spain, but a 1750 treaty with Portugal means some land will be reassigned. Spain legally does not allow a slave trade, but Portugal does. An emissary from Rome, Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) has come to determine what should happen to the various Guarani missions run by the Jesuits. He comes knowing he needs to turn them over to Portugal to demonstrate in Europe that Rome still has control over the Jesuits who tend to operate independently, sometimes against the political wishes of European leaders and the Catholic Church.Captain Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) is a former military officer who has become an active slave trader, seizing Guarani and selling them to local plantation owners. After a fight with his brother, whom he kills in a duel, Mendoza becomes exceedingly depressed and fears for his soul. Father Gabriel persuades Mendoza to seek penance by coming to his new mission. Mendoza carries a large physical burden (including his military armor) up the Iguazu Falls, to the Guarani mission. The Guarani love Father Gabriel and forgive Mendoza by cutting the cord binding him to his burden.Mendoza is transformed by living among the Guarani and becomes a Jesuit. Meanwhile, Cardinal Altamirano visits various Guarani missions, including some older ones that reflect highly developed agricultural practices, skilled artisans, and choirs that can beautifully sing the Latin liturgy. He also visits the new mission and is impressed, but in the end, says the Guarani need to return to the jungle and leave the mission which will be turned over to Portugal. He orders the Jesuits to leave, but they refuse.The Jesuits disagree about how to respond to the joint Spanish-Portuguese military attack they know is coming. Father Gabriel remains a staunch pacifist who believes resisting evil by killing is wrong. He refuses to bless Mendoza who trains the Guarani in military tactics. The invasion comes, and the Guarani (and Mendoza) are eventually overwhelmed. Father Gabriel has stayed in the church with women and children and older people and dies carrying a cross out to face the invaders. The film ends with the Cardinal writing a letter to Rome explaining what has happened.The scenery is spectacular, the music is amazing, and I needed multiple Kleenex by the end. I have no idea why it was modestly received, though the religious themes may have put off some potential viewers. For me, ""The Mission"" is probably one of my top 10 films of all time, though it might not be if I were watching it for the first time in today's culture. My religious views have shifted, but the emotional response remains.One of the secondary priests, Father John Fielding is Liam Neeson in his second major film role. Brother Sebastian is a fairly minor figure, but instantly recognizable to folks of the era, as he is played by Daniel Berrigan. About 300 Wuanana People from Colombia were used in the film to portray the Guarani.",The Mission
60,williampsamuel,The Mission sets the standard for religious films,10,7 January 2015,"The Mission is one of the most uplifting, inspiring, and at the same time tragic films I have seen in a very long time. It tells the tale of Roberto Mendoza, who was a wealthy mercenary and slaver until an unthinkable act committed in a moment of anger compelled him to seek absolution. He found it in the arms of the church, and in serving the very people he had once preyed upon. But when the people he has dedicated his life to are threatened, he will give everything he has to protect them. This is a story of the power of faith and redemption, devotion to a higher cause, and the tragic consequences of man's lust for land and power. The ending is not a happy one, but is more powerful for it.This is something of an unusual role for De Niro, better known for playing mobsters than monks, but he absolutely nails it. There are similarities to his previous roles. As Mendoza he is hot tempered and oft impulsive, a man of strong passions and strong opinions. But he also becomes a man of humility and compassion. He exudes a palpable sense of remorse and self loathing throughout his penance, and his joyous collapse atop the plateau is perhaps the most beautiful and overwhelming expression of emotional catharsis I have ever witnessed. He displays so many conflicting emotions, from despondency and brokenness to acceptance and ecstasy.The effects of this transformation are present throughout the story. Mendoza works tirelessly to serve needs of his flock and give them a voice before the powerful, risks hardship and danger in the service of the Lord and humbly submits himself before authority, even when he knows he is right. And in the end he and his brothers show themselves willing to defend their home and calling with their very lives, although it is not with reservation that he once again takes up arms. This devotion and obedience stands in harsh contrast to the pride and greed of the nobles, who are ruled by their own desires without regard for life or fear of God.De Niro's acting is far from the only beautiful thing in this movie. The film's shooting locations deep within the Amazon are magnificent. The lush jungles, sheer cliffs, and roaring waterfalls are filmed in stunning detail and drive home the remote and alien conditions the brothers- and the actors- worked under. Every pain has been taken to enhance the film's realism, with sets and costumes painstakingly detailed and the natives played by actual tribesmen. The climactic battle against the Portuguese is very well staged, by turns exhilarating and heartbreaking. Ennio Morricone's musical score is also worth noting. At times playful, majestic, and mournful, it underscores and enhances the actions and emotions in every scene.On a somewhat related note, I recently came across a discussion of James Cameron's Avatar, which also involves protagonists who defy authority and side with natives against encroaching settlers and their armies. One of the commenters made a lengthy and eloquent comment expressing his dissatisfaction with the portrayal of the natives and the interaction of their culture with humanity's. He rightly pointed out that although the N'avi are clearly meant to be the 'good' guys, they are essentially the stereotypical noble savage, completely egalitarian and living as one with nature, but without sophistication or lasting accomplishments. And more troubling to him was the fact that the two cultures had nothing in common, nothing to offer each other, and no chance of coexisting. The hero's climactic act is to become one of the natives, turning his back on his people, and driving the evil humans back to ""their dying world."" Cameron could have learned much from the Mission. The cultures here can and do blend. The Indians of the mission keep their own culture and dress, but live within the mission and worship God. Likewise Mendoza learns the natives' language and customs, is initiated as a member of the tribe, and leads their warriors in the final defense of their home. But he is still a white man. He dresses, eats, and sleeps like a Spaniard and remains foremost a member of the Jesuits, there to befriend and convert the Indians. He does not join the natives against European civilization; he defends them and his order against the worst of the colonial authorities. Both sides learn from the other and adapt without abandoning their own identity. And instead of some new age forest spirit, The Mission presents saving faith in Jesus Christ.This movie's first half is about finding forgiveness, acceptance, and a new and better purpose in life. The second is about holding fast to your conscience and convictions when all around you and above you are willing to compromise theirs and standing up for what you know is right, no matter the odds or the cost. All of it is beautiful, and having watched it I feel humbled by the courage and selflessness of these men, and hope that I can someday be half as righteous.",The Mission
61,arieliondotcom,An Artfully Done Work of Art,9,13 June 2009,"This is an outstanding film. It took me a few moments to actually follow the plot, so don't let yourself be discouraged by the start of the movie. It takes some getting used to and grounded in as you are swept between times and cultures. But you eventually get your bearings and find yourself being swept along by the cinematography, acting and story as if you were cascading down the waterfall that plays so powerfully into the scenery.It was a sudden ""ah ha!"" moment for me when I realized that this was a true story about events I'd learned about in seminary. The Jesuits had gotten into trouble with the mainline Catholic church because of their unorthodox ways of what is expected to be done, today, mixing with the culture of native tribes in order to learn their languages and teach them the Gospel. But don't be put off by the religious parts of the plot because it is not preachy at all. In fact, religion takes a definite back seat to politics and power plays as well as powerful acting.And everywhere there is astounding scenery, camera work and direction. It is so good that your mind is allowed to make connections far beyond what movies usually engender. For example, as I saw the natives standing on a bridge at one point, all of them ready to greet the approaching dignitary, I realized that they looked like ripe, brown fruit, suspended within branches as they were between Heaven and earth. And I realized that's the whole point of the Gospel and of the movie. Several allusions are made to the Garden of Eden and I realized that just as GOD made fruit of all sorts in the Garden for humanity to enjoy, we are His fruit. We are the seeds of GOD, encased in rinds of flesh for now but destined (if we will only allow Him to nourish, tend and prune us) to bear more fruit and flourish in eternal life.That recognition of Deity's touch upon humanity, in all of humanity's shapes and colors, and the need to communicate with each other, is much of the message of the film. But it is anything but a message film in the crass sense. Instead it is a step back into a time and place we can seldom experience now and a thoughtful expression of thoughts we still need to ponder and wrestle with as we deal with each other and wrestle with faith in GOD Himself.",The Mission
62,arthurclay,Very Good and Extremely Tragic,10,2 July 2005,What I would call a heart breaker of a movie emotionally. It is no surprise to a lover of history that this sort of thing occurred on a regular basis but to watch it transpire on film is horrifying. Jeremy Irons gives a great performance and ditto for DeNiro. DeNiro is a pirate and killer who by unfortunate circumstances murders his brother and forces himself to atone for it. Irons plays a priest who saves DeNiro and gives him a purpose to his life. Become a priest and follow the order. DeNiro agrees to this and joins his cause. But events beyond both of their control force them to choose a path neither one wants. Their lives and the people in their mission are doomed and the cause is lost. Watching that priest on the cross fall over the waterfall in the beginning is one of the most shocking things you could ever see in a movie it sticks in your mind for years.

65,GMJames,Politics and religion are like oil and water; they should never mix.,6,25 April 2005,"It is always very interesting how people react to movies and I was very surprised at my reaction to ""The Mission"". After the movie ended, I was more angry and exasperated than moved. I had no problems with the production. The breathtaking opening scenes alone had me hooked. It was beautifully filmed by director Roland Joffé and Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges. Two years earlier, they worked on the very moving drama ""The Killing Fields"".I've listened to sections of Ennio Morricone's musical score performed live by various choral groups and had a chance to listen to his full score on CD a few months ago. It is probably one of Morricone's best works. Even after 19 years, I'm still very shocked that he did not win an Oscar for that work. (This not to say that Herbie Hancock, the eventual winner for ""'Round Midnight"" did not deserve the award. Usually the Academy chooses traditional, epic-size scores like Morricone's. Go figure.) My major problem with the film was Robert Bolt's script. To me, the story should have been about the South American Indian chief and his tribe and not about the Jesuit priests (which included Jeremy Irons and, in one of his earliest roles, Liam Neeson) trying to convert them to Christianity.I also had a major problem with the character played by Robert De Niro. Was this character added to the story as an afterthought? I don't believe the character of the slave trader/mercenary/monk was necessary. It was more of a plot contrivance. It also did not help that De Niro was poorly miscast. Ironically, Spainard Antonio Banderas might have been a better choice. (I would have said Javier Bardem but he was 17 years old when the movie was released.)The late Ray McAnally easily gave the best performance as Cardinal Altamirano. Despite being enamored of the work of the Jesuits and having many natives becoming Christian, his decisions would eventually set in motion the fate of everyone. Is Altamirano an evil man? Did he do God's will? Were the decisions made to exert the power of the church? The character was very complex and McAnally should have gotten a Supporting Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance.There's a lot to admire but, overall, ""The Mission"" was a bit of a disappointment. It should have been better.",The Mission
66,georgioskarpouzas,good and bad colonialists,7,22 August 2006,"This film is a treatise on colonial ambiguities and the contradictions of empire-building.The Jesuit order, an order of the Catholic Church devoted to tertiary education, is the ideological wing of the Catholic empires. The empires are born not because of altruism but because of the greed of powerful courts, conformism of general populations and lack of spiritual and basically material defences of indigenous peoples. The centre views the periphery as source of enrichment, but some charismatic people such as Jeremy Irons's Jesuit take seriously the teachings of the religion they profess and try to find a modus vivendi between the various constitutive elements of imperial societies. For leaders as usually religion is sham under which they hide their power-hungry, greedy and vicious nature. As the Bible says they are false prophets, wolves dressed in the garments of sheep.But in the movie at least there is a true prophet -jeremy Irons- and a basically well-meaning but lukewarm church dignitary who fails beside his good intentions to prevent the impending catastrophe, proving the veracity of the old saying that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.It is a good movie on a perennial theme.",The Mission

68,Dello_,Majestic score but disjointed plot,7,19 July 2020,"""The Mission"" is a movie that has good parts but doesn't quite work properly as a all. Indeed I had the feeling that it's like two different movies condensed in one, not because of poor pacing or editing problems but merely as a plot level. The film can be divided in three parts: the initial redemption, the missions and the finale but they don't fit well together and they feel like two very different storylines. Indeed I can't tell what the movie is about: it's about a man who goes trough a journey of redemption and acts in a way that I won't spoil after that? Or is it about the missions in South America and how those missions relate with Spain and Portugal? I don't know because it's both and none. The problem is that the first part (centred around De Niro's character) is long and you care about this man, his struggles and he's the clear protagonist of the first part. Then the movie shifts to the missions and it hides De Niro's character and I was like: ""yeah I like this but where's De Niro?"". And though I liked the second part I was quite bored because I watched like 40 minutes of a story that wasn't important for what I was seeing. And then the finale brings together the two previous stories but not in a satisfying way (and I'm not talking if the story went where I wanted or not but I'm implying that it didn't tied well together the first parts). ""The Mission"" however is not a bad movie overall, the acting, the direction, the cinematography are all great and the score is divine. Ennio Morricone proves his talents once again and ""Gabriel's oboe"" is a masterpiece. As I said the story and the parts are good, but have some problems interacting with each others. And so ""The Mission"" was a good time but I don't think it will be one of those movies I will strongly recommend watching to my friends.",The Mission

My rating 9
That is a beautiful film. It gieves peace to the viewer, while showing a great battle between Spanish and Portugese authorities in South America, and the Indians who are trying to protect their territoey as well as Jesuit mission.
As I see, the main theme here is redemption. Redemtion of Mendoza in partucalar and Europeans in general. Though them, represented by Portuguese have a long and difficult path towards it.
So the Jesuits and the Guarani tribe are planning to fight to save the mission. Only Father Gabriel is ambiguos, as for him God is love, and the way of war is not for him.
Although the cast is marvelous, no one has leading position in the movie. the story is centred on Indian tribe and protection of their home - the mission. I like it very much.
The historic context is well put regarding treaty between Portugal and Spain about American territory. What and why they were doing there.
I have to admit, high priest is shown as true God´s person, yet we knw that veven churchmen had their evildoing part in South America.
So finally I think that this film redeems everyone apart Portuguese slave trading authorities.",The Mission
70,ereinion,Poignant and touching,9,7 January 2004,"This is a movie that will always stay in my memory.First time I saw it, back in the late 80's,I thought it was too brutal and even morbid in a way.But the second and third time I was swept off by its non-conformistic beauty.The story begins unusually,with De Niro's character killing his own brother over a woman.The good priest in Irons' interpretation steps in as guiding light and leads him to salvation,which means that he takes him to his own Mission deep in the jungles.There De Niro is born again as an individual,though he doesn't lose his warrior instincts and I believe much of his story revolves around dealing with his newfound identity as a Christian and struggle to shake his old militant ways.The film gives us some strong performances and both De Niro and Irons should be praised for they pull it off wonderfully in their parts.I believe this to be De Niro's last great performance.The movie is beautifully shot,a Roland Joffe trademark,and though it ends tragically it isn't a sad film.Its poignant and highly enlightening and I believe many souls were deeply changed after seeing it.The Morricone score is brilliant as always.A nice supporting cast includes Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn in some of their best early work.

73,gpadillo,Still potent after all these years,10,30 June 2010,"I just finished watching a movie that, when I first saw it in 1986, made such an impression on me that I could think of nothing else for days. It came at a fragile and life changing moment in my life and for some seven nights I walked several miles back and forth in a bitter winter to see it at the once splendid Ontario Theatre in Washington, DC. The film was Roland Joffé's epic ""The Mission"" with the unlikely cast of Jeremy Irons, Robert DeNiro, Liam Neeson and Ray McNally. When I first saw it I thought it to be amongst the most beautiful films I'd ever seen, and nearly 25 years later, think so still. While nominated and winning many international awards, The Mission was mostly ignored by Hollywood, receiving only one Oscar (cinematography).The complexities of the story telling in ""The Mission"" are almost too much to take in in a single film lasting a bit more than two hours, but Jaffe has woven them together with a touch that is both delicate and profound, creating a tapestry as impressive and intricate as any medieval Flemish tapestry, its story held together flawlessly.While supposedly created for our own preservation and edification, politics and religion have done as much or more unspeakable horrors in the names of God and Man as they have good and in ""The Mission"" we see the bloody result, despite the effort of a few rebel priests who believe in the power of love and the natives with whom they try to share their world. The villains are plentiful in this ""true tale"" and Joffe never disguises them, allowing the deceptive simplicities of ""good versus evil"" run its predictable course, as they twist and turn everything they touch into the inevitable choked and knotted apocalypse of sorrow that is always the end result of greed.Despite its bleak, often hopeless nature, Joffe nonetheless gives us a miracle: a film of such ineffable beauty that stirs both heart and mind through the combination of remarkable acting, a wilderness captured in breathtaking cinematography, battles both physical and spiritual, and wed it all to one of the most remarkable musical scores of the late 20th century.",The Mission

It builds and builds and builds to its tragic end in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. And this story is a side of the Americas no one ever talks about - if they're aware of it at all. Anyone who cares about what we did to the Native Americans in the United States needs to see what the Europeans did to the indigenous people of South America - as is brought out (at least one side of it) in this deeply touching movie about early power struggles in the New World.

80,Jerominator,Grace and love versus politics and hatred,9,23 July 2013,"This film is a re-imagining of events surrounding The Treaty of Madrid in 1750 which formalised the transfer of Paraguayan territory from Spain to Portugal. Moreover, it focuses on the fate of the indigenous tribesmen who'd previously fled to Jesuit missions located within that territory to escape Portuguese slavers.The film opens with a man dictating a letter. The man - Cardinal Altamirano, a papal emissary sent from Europe to meet with the Jesuits and slavers before deciding the fate of the disputed missions. The letter - a progress report to the Pope, recounting his visit and relaying his decision. As he begins to describe the events leading up to his visit, we are transported back in time to witness these events unfold.Jesuit priests have established missions from which they strike out into the jungle to evangelise any indigenous tribesmen they encounter, risking martyrdom in the process. Meanwhile slavers, the antithesis of the Jesuits, prey on the same tribesmen in hope of capturing them and selling them into slavery.We follow a priest and a slaver, Father Gabriel & Rodrigo Mendoza. At the outset these men are at odds with each other, but cruelest serendipity brings them together and eventually Rodrigo accompanies Gabriel to his mission to live among and serve the very people he once persecuted.With the treaty already signed and the land transferred from Spain to Portugal, the Cardinal is sent to decide whether the missions are to remain under the Vatican's protection or simply be abandoned, effectively condemning the tribesmen living on the missions into slavery.Caught in a ""Hobson's choice"" predicament, the cardinal quickly realises the right thing to do, yet it conflicts sharply with the church's precarious political dependencies. Protecting the missions will endanger the Jesuit order and betray the very church he serves. So the decision is all but made and his visit is nothing more than a perfunctory gesture.This part is played well by Ray McAnally who for the most part conceals his true feelings and emotions, knowing they are unbefitting to his position.The most interesting character is Rodrigo. His journey is a tragic one. Unbearable pain transforms him from monster to man of compassion but his new-found peace is short-lived. Threatened by the very forces he once served, he has to choose whether to stay true to the Jesuit way of love and allow the tribesmen to be slaughtered, or break his vows, and murder to defend them. A very cruel predicament to be put in after what he's just been through. One of DeNiro's best, and last great performances.Then we have Father Gabriel. He embodies the love and compassion at the heart of his religion and people flock to him as a result - even Rodrigo and the otherwise hostile tribesmen are subdued. Jeremy Irons was very apt for this role, as if he believed the message behind the words.The tribal chief was played well by Asuncion Ontiveros. On the face of it he could be just another tribesmen, but he exhibits this tacit authority, hard-earned dignity and an overt distrust of the outsiders that seems to befit a tribal leader in his position.Chuck Low and Ronald Pickup have more one dimensional roles as the Protuguese slavers but they put in good performances nonetheless. Liam Neeson, Cheri Lunghi and Aiden Quinn make brief appearances, but just not enough material to merit comment.Personally, I would always rather see an accurate account of what happened rather than a crowd-pleasing or Oscar-winning fabrication. However screenwriters, directors and producers would probably argue that this is unrealistic because studios(and audiences to some degree) demand entertaining stories with heroes and villains, winners and losers, love interest, a moral or happy ending, and all within a very short period of time.So maybe we need to learn that this is just how the movie industry works and stop expecting accurate history lessons from movies.Long story short - we can take historical inaccuracies as a given in any historical film like this.The direction and camera work is just superb throughout this film.We have the signature scene of the film where a martyred priest is tied to a crucifix and sent over a waterfall. That one speaks for itself.Some of the scenes where the cardinal visits the missions are absolutely captivating - the choir singing against the backdrop of virgin rainforest is unusual and breathtaking. At the same time it's somewhat disturbing that these tribesmen have been so far contorted from their natural way of life in such a short time. But then the movie is full of contrasts like this - love/hate, freedom/captivity, right/wrong, revenge/forgiveness, humanity/politics, violence/passivity.The latter is played out beautifully in the scene where the mission is under attack and while Gabriel and his followers forsake violence in place of worship, Rodrigo and his band of men bravely attempt to thwart the imminent invasion.One particular shot stood out for me - where Rodrigo just killed his brother. I'm not entirely sure how it's done but something to do with focusing on the main character and making the background loom up around him. It worked so well, evoking the terrible realisation of what he'd just done.The film reminds me of Malick's Thin Red Line in as much as it doesn't just tell a historical story, but is also a fundamental examination of humanity, love and compassion in a brutal world. This duality works so well in these movies for me. What better purpose for a film than to make people think about this? It can be life changing to the viewer in a positive way if watched and understood with respect.If it weren't for the historical inaccuracies I'd easily give this a 10. It's a brilliantly made and acted film that can be appreciated time and time again.",The Mission

It is true that the film moves along very slowly until the last half-hour and De Nero seems oddly detracted in his performance.

Endlessly beautiful, the film evokes a true sense of period and setting with its production values, photography and Morricone's brilliant score.

The Spanish director Roland Joffé crafts a movie (after the book) narrow with both the novel and the history as it's known.The first part is a quick evolution of the facts, through a Jesuits' conversion mission in southern America. When it was a mere religion affair the Spanish ministers of the Kingdom didn't interfere with their influence; but when ""the mission"" became a village with his own profit, the greed and the arrogance started flaring up.The most touching part is the second one, where the war, its madness (even in the name of God, again!!), its foolish utilities, shows what a few band of men can generate.I was amazed by 1) the scene where the little girl watches terrified the carnage of her people, unable to understand, to figure out the reasons; 2) the final scene, the procession. It had to end like that but the tardy regret of the minister is a heavy punch in the stomach.While I found Irons' acting very convincing (like always), I disliked the De Niro role, either for his character, ambiguous, unpleasant, or for his acting skills, this time below the average (I think).Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is marvelous as always, but this time he really deserved the Oscar, assigned instead to the stunning cinematography.A story about the consequences of erroneously choices, for which a war was supposed to be the remedy.",The Mission

And if everyone would follow the good part, well, heaven on earth.Even though not as brutal as the rest of the catholic church, the Jesuits were in some way pathfinders for the west. And they did not have, and do not have, any respect for foreign cultures and believes. In their blind religious faith they think (until today) that a non-Christian soul is lost forever. In fact losing its eternal afterlife.And that justifies almost anything to convert heathens into Christians. They were and are in strict accordance with Rome.A large church of course has a lot of factions, true believers and straight forward earthly politicians. So the roman catholic church never has been a pure spiritual organization and often enough sacrificed believe over power.So in this example of its history. Big surprise, isn't it? And sure, the natives are living in a paradise and are true angels. The usual romantic stuff. So the audience feels a lot of sympathy for the natives.

CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: Often times, good does not triumph over evil. But it is still worth the struggle. PROS AND CONS This is a very good film. It won the Grand Prize at Cannes and also won an Oscar for best cinematography for obvious reasons. According to the opening credits the story depicted in this film actually happened. The acting in this film is somewhat low key with the story and the scenery taking center stage. Having watched this film several years ago, I was struck by my slightly different perspective after this viewing. The real focus is the turmoil and suffering of the Viceroy that is sent to administer the will of the king and not the fate of the native peoples or the Jesuits that are sent to show them salvation. The Viceroy, played by Ray McAnally, gives the best performance in the film as the ex-Jesuit Priest who now obeys the king and not the teachings of the church. In the end he is a shattered man, having done his duty against his better judgment. This film is about the difference between doing what is right and doing what you are told. The struggle we all have between being obidiant or following our heart. This is a dilemma we all must face at least once in our lives. The mercenaries and profiters try and comfort the Viceroy at the end of the picture by reaffirming that, ""This is the way it has to be. So is the world made."" To which the Viceroy responds, ""No, So have we made the world."" Even after 300 years, somethings never change. That is why this film still carries such profound meaning.",The Mission

91,arahman,An Engrossing Visual Adventure,5,25 July 2005,"The Mission The Mission is the story of how Spanish Jesuits voyage to South America in the 18th Century in an attempt to spread Christianity to the native Indians who reside in the region. When there is transition from Spanish to Portuguese occupation however, the natives are legally treated as slaves and their status as Christians and indeed as human beings is effectively revoked. Robert De Niro plays a ruthless slave trader who becomes a priest after he is overcome by the guilt of his sins. Much of the film simultaneously documents his transition to the faith and these scenes are some of the most powerful in the film. Jeremy Irons plays Father Gabriel, head of the Spanish Jesuit order who is able to help both De Niro and the native Indians. The film also features the very young looking Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn. The Mission received an Oscar for Cinematography and with stunning visuals and a breathtaking display of the jungle it is not hard to see why. Ennio Morricone's score also received an Oscar nomination and various other awards (e.g. Golden Globe and BAFTA). Morricone's score will undoubtedly stand the test of time as one of the most powerful soundtracks to grace the big screen. It is powerful, emotive and poetic and almost warrants viewing the movie alone. Fans of movie soundtracks will not be disappointed. Overall performances are decent with De Niro again stealing the show. The Mission is a good example of De Niro delivering a powerful performance without having to make too much of a song and dance visually. He also illustrates the contrast between an angry and menacing individual in the early part of the movie to one that is more at peace with others in the latter part of the movie suggesting that anyone can achieve redemption. The Mission is quite an engrossing movie that is possibly drawn out for a little too long. The visual and audio feast is enough to warrant a viewing but it somehow feels like it lacks the hall marks of a true classic.

Although the film has a number of isolated merits, the end product is a resolute dissapointment.The opening sequence, a missionary attached to a cross making his way towards oblivion by way of a thunderous waterfall, masterfully segueing into Ennio Morricone's majestic theme; Jeremy Iron's Jesuit priest making his way up that same waterfall; the montage conveying the construction of the mission; the well placed use of Ray MacAnnalay's ambiguously doting, melancholy voice over, amongst others. The irony is that the film's major flaws result from these moments: the constant crescendo of emotional peaks, swelling violins, etc. combined with a narrative which contains such an obvious, inevitable conclusion, underscores most of the film's dramatic power.The ending itself is a mess; it is badly choreographed (the soldier extra's don't seem to know in which direction to point their cannons and guns), with De Niro and Irons (as well as the Indian extra's) temporally confused as if their faculties have been clouded by langorous jungle narcotics. It seems rushed, probably due to its judiciously hurried inclusion in the 1987 Cannes Film Festival roster (it did win the 'Palme D'Or', granted).
Overall, a noble failure.",The Mission
96,lulzrawr,Catholic propaganda film,6,15 January 2021,"This movie feels like catholic propaganda.The Catholics were brutal, and condoned slavery in that era. The Spanish proclamation to the aboriginals in South America was horrific, proclaiming that the Catholic church had donated the lands to the King and Queen of Spain, and that anyone who would not submit, both to Spain and to the Catholic church, would be either killed or enslaved.They then proceeded to do exactly that, mass-murdering and enslaving the natives.If you can get past that, it is a powerful movie.

This is how a movie should be like! I love the story (and the way its told), I love the score (Morricone rules!), I love the photography (simply amazing and fascinating), I love the acting of both the main actors (don't need to name them) who help the talented director Roland Joffe' depicting one of the finest images of the struggles the native South Americans have been through centuries ago just to keep their culture and identity alive (and the battle is still raging, as we can read in the ending lines). This is a movie filled with pure and deep humanity, charity, this is about mistakes and forgiveness, sins and redemption, the power of weapons against the weight of love, but most of all, the lessons we read between its lines is that, even in death, hope never dies, like the memory of great people will live forever as the living keep it alive.

100,soniaandree,"Utterly beautiful, fantastic movie!",10,7 August 2006,"The story is based on the divide of Latin-America by Spain and Portugal in 18th Century. For the Roman Catholic church, it meant that Jesuits had to go as part of the deal to allow the church to stay present in Portuguese territory. The Jesuit order had, by then, grown into a strong and powerful order which threatened commercial relations between countries by preventing slavery in their Missions. This movie then takes on some fictional characters to illustrate the struggle faced by the Jesuits and the Church, the Guaranis, and the difficult relations with Spain and Portugal. Great acting by all, and beautiful, haunting, scenery (the Iguacu falls in Venezuela) and a good basis for a strong scenario makes this movie an all time favourite of mine. A definite must for everyone's DVD collection (the double-DVD set is best). A classic!",The Mission
101,Bailiff,Interesting but not Spectacular,6,4 May 2005,"The Mission is a film that boasts, above all else, breathtaking scenery of the South American continent, including the massive Iguazu waterfalls of Argentina (near its border with Paraguay). Underneath this eye candy, however, is an unevenly directed, and straightforward, though occasionally intriguing, story, topped by somewhat tepid performances from the cast.Based loosely off of true events, The Mission is set in the 1750s in the regions of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, when Spanish and Portuguese colonial forces were continuously seeking to expand their territories and constantly fighting one another. Wrapped up in these colonial skirmishes are the indigenous people of the region, namely the Guarani Indians. Jeremy Irons plays the Jesuit priest and missionary Father Gabriel, who with his comrades seeks to peacefully convert the natives to Christianity and teach them the finer aspects of Western Civilization. Compromising these efforts, however, are Spanish soldiers, particularly the mercenary Rodrigo Mendoza, played by Robert De Niro, who see the natives as savages and no better than animals, useful only as slaves for the Europeans and as occasional hunting targets.Through a tragic sequence of events, however, Mendoza is convicted of murder, and in his grief attempts to seek repentance. Father Gabriel decides to take Mendoza under the wing of his Order, and the group heads back from the Spanish settlement to the missions of the Guarani. Mendoza lives among the peaceful natives and is born anew as a Jesuit priest.The Guarani's and Jesuit's troubles are not over, however. The Portuguese are encroaching on the Guarani missions, seeking to enslave them and create profit for their overseas colonies. The Spanish and the Papacy's emissaries are unsympathetic to the Jesuits' concerns for the Guarani; the official Church, in fact, still does not really recognize the Guarani as human beings. This leaves Father Mendoza, Father Gabriel, their Jesuit compatriots, and the Guarani on their own, and a conflict arises between the Jesuits' views of nonviolence and the increasing necessity of preparing to do battle with the Portuguese, who will certainly destroy them if they do not resist.As stated earlier, the film has a fairly straightforward story. This of course would not be a negative if the story instead chose to focus on character development, but it only provides surface level insight into the main characters played by De Niro and Irons. The Guarani have no prominent role in the film; they are entirely props, background fodder to the white leading stars. In this sense The Mission takes the same path many films about the civil rights movement do: making white characters the main protagonists and leaving the black characters as supporting voices at best, often in order to appeal to a presumably majority white audience. We learn very little about the Guarani themselves beyond the fact that they have spears and seem to readily give up their own beliefs and traditions for Christianity. What are their thoughts and feelings concerning the warring Europeans? Do they truly believe what the Jesuits are telling them, or do they sometimes have doubts? The conflicts between the Papal authorities in South America and the Jesuits are handled well. Historically the Jesuits have been the ""thorn in the paw"" of the Catholic Church despite their nominal allegiance to the Pope, and this is quite evident in the film. The missions are designed in a style similar to the French radicalism of the period (the film is set decades prior to the French Revolution of 1789), where the Guarani share everything in common. This socialistic style is reminiscent of the Marxist liberation theology many priests chose to take in the 20th century, including the American Daniel Berrigan, who in fact has a minor role in this film.The film is beautifully shot and features lush cinematography; however, the battle choreography of the film's climax is somewhat ragged and unrealistic; the relative lack of character development adds to the ""ho hum"" feeling one gets while watching the Portuguese and the Guarani-Jesuit team fight it out on land and in kayaks.The performances are decent though not spectacular. Robert De Niro seems occasionally uncomfortable in his role as Mendoza. Jeremy Irons does a good job as Father Gabriel and the other actors perform adequately. The dialogue, however, is such that none of the performances, except perhaps for Mr. Irons, are very memorable.Apparently The Mission also seeks to give the audience a moral lesson about modern day transgressions against the Guarani and other indigenous people in the Americas, but this is not particularly effective and comes across as cloying and, frankly, patronizing towards the natives, who, as stated earlier, are simply props in this story.Those with an interest in colonial South American history will find this film watchable, as will anyone who enjoys gorgeous scenery. But aside from a few memorable moments, The Mission doesn't stand out as truly brilliant cinema.",The Mission
102,grandisdavid,Masterpiece,10,29 July 2004,"When I first saw this movie in Cannes film festival, I knew it would get the golden palm, Roland Joffe had already proven his mastery with his excellent ""Killing Fields"", but this time, he really reached a state of grace. The acting of Irons and De Niro is OUTSTANDING, the photography is gorgeous, the plot is extremely interesting and profound, I give it an absolute 10, I've seen many movies in my life, and it has never reached such a level of passion and enlightenment. As a conductor, I have also to point out the importance of the soundtrack, how many times I've seen a movie ruined by a poor musical background! But nothing like that here, Morriconne signed one of his best inspired scores. Some people talk about historic inaccuracy, I strongly disagree and I suspect this comment to come from religious zealots; ethnological studies of Claude Levi-Strauss, George Dumezil or Marcel Mauss have mentioned similar historical cases...",The Mission
103,gardner-2,Deeply human,10,2 March 1999,"I think ""The Mission"" is better than Joffé's ""The killing fields"". The background-story is about political power between Spain and Portugal in 1750 and a Cardinal sent by Rome. But above all it tells of two men. Jeremy Irons is Jesuit Gabriel who builds a mission in South American jungles. He has got a deep human character and believes in peace and love. Robert DeNiro is more interesting. After killing his brother in a duel, he changes from brutal slave-trader to an expiating Jesuit. One of the best sequences is when native Indians recognize DeNiro. It looks first as if an Indian would kill him with a knife, but then he cuts the rope with that DeNiro carried a heavy ballast of weapons and armings. DeNiro cries and laughs simultaneously because he is redeemed. This goes right through your heart. Chris Menges cinematography is wonderful. Ennio Morricone wrote one of the most remarkable scores of film history. Don't leave the cinema while cast and credits are running over the screen at the end! You would miss the last sequence!",The Mission

I was 13, and I was utterly captivated and moved by this beautiful masterpiece.I won't tell you the story - you can read that elsewhere.  But it contains possibly one of the best displays of raw acting ability I've ever seen - Robert DeNiro (who else?)His ability to portray essentially two different characters, yet maintain a sense of cohesion throughout is magnificent.  I remain moved and enthralled by his change of heart in this film, and his ability to constantly, in every movie he has ever made, but this one especially, make you believe and care about him.Jeremy Irons has a wonderfully subdued yet brilliant part as the missionary who brings DeNiro into the flock.  His quiet faith and unwavering pacifism and belief that God's will be done is almost enough to make an unbeliever like me have faith.  Ennio Morricione (i believe that's how you spell it) constructs yet another memorable and fitting score to this movie.  I love all his movie music, from the immortal intro to ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"", to this haunting and moving score, he is one of the true geniuses of movie conducters.This is truely one of the most over-looked, under-rated brilliant movies of all time.",The Mission
105,FFour,Still Stands As My Favorite Movie Ever Seen,10,3 June 2013,"I first saw this production about 26 years ago, and my initial impressions were that the cinematography, settings, acting, writing, everything about it was fantastic. I have watched it time and time again over the years, and no other movie has yet surpassed this as being number one in my very long list of watched movies. It is a poignant story of grace, forgiveness, redemption and honor. It portrays these attributes in very moving ways, similar to Les Miserables. I try to see most films starring Robert De Niro, and my personal opinion is that his acting for this role was his best performance to date. Now, that is saying something, because I consistently find his acting brilliant in most of his roles (i.e., GoodFellas, Casino), even in the movie Stardust (where he provided us with a very unique performance). I don't want to detract from the acting by Jeremy Irons, which l also found tremendous. Despite the great acting and beautifully filmed settings, the top honors for this film should go to the fantastic story written by Robert Bolt, who formerly brought us renowned screenplays such as Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and other great stories before he passed in 1995.

Then of course there is Ennio Morricone's haunting score, which is also on my list ""greatests."" It is beautiful directed and perfectly acted throughout. Irons and DeNiro are sublime. As a cinematic experience, most of the beauty lies in the film's first hour, and it then begins (by design) to lead to its more frustrating and tragic end. The dialogue is often mediocre and minimal, and if I have a critique of Morricone's brilliant score, it is that he blends themes at times to the point almost of cacophony, so that the magnificence of what he composed is often best heard in symphonic performances taken and rearranged. Nevertheless, I cannot hear ""Gabriel's Oboe"" or ""The Falls"" without feeling a lump in my throat.",The Mission

People who are giving poor rating to this masterpiece should review its own critical spirit, and at least recognize that the film is extremely worthy of all the merits that categorizes it as a unique work, with a surprising critical appeal.The work of Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro is exclusive of actors with such power of interpretation of the character. They adhere absolutely to the role for which they were designated, and makes you feel guilty for not being born at that time, and changed the course of history.Through all the film the geniality of Ennio Morricone who created the most perfect soundtrack that could have been created for a work like the movie The Mission.An unrivaled work with the saddest film ending of history, everyone should watch this movie.",The Mission

But aside from cultural, linguistic and climatic problems, they have to face ruthless politics within and outside of the church undervaluing its importance. The cast delivers respectable performances and the script by Robert Bolt is thoughtful in examining diverse issues of belief, cultural differences, violence etc., but they are almost lost in brilliant scenery and Oscar-winning visuals from Chris Menges.

De Niro is a violent rogue who is confronted with the emptiness of life through his own irresponsible actions. Neeson plays one of his earlier supporting roles.The humanity of the Indians, who were regarded as ""heathens"" by most Europeans of the time, is shown to us in heartwarming fashion, and we are touched by the noble efforts of the missionaries.

118,netrek,A true masterpiece,10,9 February 2011,"This film is a true masterpiece. I easily place it within my top 100 films of all time. The story is very human, and while some reviewers think this picture is a critique of faith, particularly the Catholic Church, I do not agree. Yes colonialism had its problems and was a flawed vehicle for the Gospel, but the Indians came to beautiful faith genuinely. Also the priests had an abiding love for these Indians as people, not as mere numbers to add to their scrolls. Real faith is not something which can be forced. And in the end of the movie the Indians and priests give one of the most compelling and loving scenes of martyrdom I have ever witnessed on film. Yes it is sad how they are cut down, but they gain far more than they lose, and in doing so show that true faith cannot be destroyed. I should state that I'm a Protestant, but I have known priests, and the character Jeremy Irons plays reminds me of several dear priests I've encountered. DeNiro gave probably the best performance of his career in this film, the only other contender would be ""Deer Hunter"". The scene when they reach the top of the mountain and the Indian cuts off the dead weight of the armor (symbolic of the guilt and anguish he'd be carrying over his brother's death) and DeNiro breaks down and expresses sorrow and finally joy it is truly sublime! Ennio Morricone's music beautifully complements the film (both in pacing and detail) and shows his preeminence amongst film composers! I should also comment on the film's lush cinematography.

This is my favorite movie ever, and let's make it clear... I'm not catholic. Indeed, I'm not a religious person. The greatness of this film can be found all along its plot. But IMO, what makes ""The Mission"" truly unique is its end. This is the story of how two opposing views of justice and redemption fail, at the same time, in the same place, succumbing together to the stupidity of humankind. You can see it as a dark end but on the other hand, it's very real. ""The Mission"" is always there to remember us that individual efforts to fight justice are valuable but insufficient to tackle political games. Any application to our current state of the world is not a coincidence. On top of that, it is a beautiful master piece for photography and music.

123,yesjozee,"Very beautiful, amazing, and very underrated film.",9,10 February 2012,"This is one of the few movies I can honestly say earned it's award at the Cannes Film Festival back in 1986. What is interesting is that this would be one of the only recognitions the film would garner. Critics were incredibly hard on it when first released. Box-office really didn't hit any records here in the U.S.-of course that year we had 'Aliens','Ferris Bueller', just to name a few classic megahits being released on top of each other. The film begins with a beautiful yet haunting shot of a man on a crucifix washing over and down gigantic waterfall. This is what we come to learn is a ritual for the dead held by the native Indians in South America circa 18th century. The dead man is one of their local missionaires who try to teach and bring religion to the local natives rather than hunt or enslave them which was what wonderful people of moneys would do at the time. With Ennio Morricone's amazing music we're introduced to the new priest that will be his replacement sent to the natives to continue the Church's Mission to humanize the indians. This is one of the major plot points and arguments the movie holds throughout with elegance. The sub-plot is actually the character of Mendoza (wonderfully played by De Niro) whose fall from grace after murdering his brother (that's right it's Aidan Quin as his brother) who was having an affair with Medoza's wife. At this point the film's redemption tale begins where Mendoza will have to choose which path he will have to take to feel the power of God. The Spanish and Portugese Armies come hammering down in on the natives with only the brotherhood to help. I know people feel the ending is a big downer but the message is so powerful that you have to look past the violence against humanity and see that the two heroes of the story never gave in. I mean if somehow everyone can accept the strangely uneven ending of ""No Country for Old Men"" (which I am a fan of) there's no missing the obvious message in this overlooked classic.",The Mission
124,theindependent11,Why is that only interesting movies are financial flops?,10,29 December 2016,"I know why some critics dislike this movie, it's because Robert de Niro is not the centre of attentions for a change. It's not really about him, it's about indians in the Amazon and it's about a piece of history Americans aren't familiar with (they probably don't even know who the Jesuits is, never mind Portugal or Marquis de Pombal). I absolutely loved it, I think Jeremy Irons was great in it, it was visually and melodically (Ennio Morricone) mesmerising, it made me think about the world being a rubbish place, about evil and power. The only thing I would like to say against it is that it portrays the Jesuits as being all about love and poverty. That is not true. One of the reasons why Marquis de Pombal and the King of Portugal wanted to end the Jesuit order was because they were filthy rich, they owned lands, they had a lot of power in those days. It wasn't just about the slave market, there were political reasons behind. Anyway, I don't know why I never watched this movie on TV, why I only found out about it through Ennio's soundtrack, because it's essentially amazing.",The Mission
125,bbone,Simply church propaganda.,1,4 July 2006,"The whole movie plot is about to show us, what good the church do, when it can. In reality, where the church go, there bring chaos, death and degradation of culture. A prime example could be all the crusades against Arabs/Muslims. At that time we should learn from them, rather that convert them to Christianity by sword and fire. These jesuits are presented as heroes, but into reality, they bring the destruction of the Indians by driving them from the jungle to homes, witch can be subject to attack and conquer by the ""settlers"". Back in Europe is was the jesuits, who started the chase on witches. So, given the general reality that any religion is just for control of people, I see these movie as unjust and very unfair church propaganda. Yes, there are individuals that tried to do good. But they can't overstep the shadow of their curse - their religion. Cristian religion (very interestingly founded by jews) is prime example of religion to divide and control the mankind. By proclamation of fake values it turning the real values to dust and bringing the degradation of culture altogether. The fall of Rome is nice example of early christians (jews?!) work. It is good to mention that when Rome fall, the ""holly lands"" ""god promised"" to jews are then free of Romans and fell into control of jews, so they had the motive too... Anyway, the movie play (mainly DeNiro) is excellent, however that won't overcome the propaganda in the plot...",The Mission

The Portuguese infiltrate the land of these people, and use them as slaves, despite the objection of the Spanish missionaries.

127,cubinator,Glorious,9,9 April 2002,"The First Time I saw this movie my father bought the score by Ennio Morricone.  The score is one of the Greatest ever written for the movie. The Cinematography is beautiful.  This film is probably one of the best films ever made about religion.  The film begins with Jeremy Irons (Giving a beautiful performance) And Liam Neeson (in one of his first movies) go to the waterfall where Gabriel (Irons) is to find the old mission where the old missonary died.  The scene where he is playing the oboe is one of the greatest music scenes ever put on film.  The opening scene is a classic, where the man is on the cross and falls down the waterfall.  Robert De Niro, (In another convincing performance) Shines as Mendoza.  The final scene when the army invades and when De Niro is looking at Irons is one of the greatest Movie Looks of all time.  And the ending wants you to wonder,  Is where God is Love is, or is it the other way around.  This is the best religious film ever made, and one of the finest historical dramas made.",The Mission
128,sandle_wood_,Words alone are not enough......,10,6 November 2002,"I have read the other comments and am stunned by people who view The Mission in a negative light. It feels as though you are attacking a loved one - perhaps because this movie IS a loved one to me.  Never, ever have I felt so deeply about a film.  I don't have any idea where to begin checking off the pro's:  cinematography? stupendous acting? heart-breaking subject matter? moving soundtrack?  I don't think it's possible to do that with The Mission - one needs to absorb it as a whole.  An entire masterpiece.I was one of the fortunate ones to see this movie in a theatre back in the 80's - we were visiting friends in another city and, for lack of anything better to do that evening, decided to see this film. To say I was moved would be such an understatement as to be ridiculous. It is the saddest commentary on what horrors have been perpetrated in the name of God....I have seen this movie several times since then and own it now but I am always very careful whom I see it with and when I see it.  You need to have a block of time set aside when you can completely immerse yourself in this film. Unplug the phone, put the kids to bed, make sure the dog doesn't have to go out. If you don't pay attention - from the very beginning to right after the credits - you will miss something important.  Prepare yourself emotionally for The Mission. Step into it, live it, let it speak to you. Feel the struggle of all involved.I love this movie. infinity out of 10",The Mission
129,Makaroni,Boring,2,15 January 2003,"This movie isn't nearly as good as many people claim it is. I think it's one of those emperor's clothes type effects. The plot isn't too bad or anything, and the acting is pretty solid.(What little there is....)But aside from that this movie has nothing going for it at all. There are massive amounts of time when nothing, nothing at all, is happening. You'll just just hear bad music(The soundtrack is horrible and it will stick in your head for days)and see random shots of the jungle. Maybe a few natives here and there building something, cooking something, walking through said jungle. It just goes on like that. I have seen this movie three times and each time it was a harder struggle to stay awake.Then (SPOILER) at the end, there is this small battle in which Mendoza,(Smart Priest) fights the Portugese army to save the mission. At the same time, the other guy, who I will dub Stupid Priest, decides to sing and walk peacefully toward the army of portugese who are shooting at him. The stupidity of this absolutely blew me away. Who sings when large groups of soldiers are trying to kill them? No one does. They run away. If they have guts they fight, but no one sings. Is this man that stupid? Apparently it was an attempt at a ""violence is never the answer"" type message. That's fine. There are plenty of movies that pulled that off very well.(American History X, for example)But this is just stupid. It really defeats itself too. Those Portugese were pretty violent and it looks like they definitely came out ahead when it was all said and done.",The Mission
130,yarumelaone,An excellent and moving film,10,5 June 2000,"I would have to say that this is probably my favorite film of all time. Its got an amazing cast, with Irons particularly giving a powerful performance of great depth. De Niro is very good, although his underdeveloped character in the film prevents him from showing his true range as an actor. I especially liked the even-handedness of the story line. While many movies that deal with the exploration of the western hemisphere present a simplified and inaccurate portrayal of the European and Indigenous people's roles in that segment of world history, The Mission is written with a depth and complexity that better reflects what was really happening at that period of time. I first saw this movie in high school and have watched it again and again during 9 years of undergraduate and graduate education in Anthropology, and the insightfulness of the storyline still impresses me. Written as a screenplay that attempts to make the viewer think about history, culture and human interaction, it succeeds on all counts.",The Mission

Set against a wonderful score by Ennio Morricone, De Niro shows he is just as effective being understated as he is a violent mobster, Jeremy Irons is as excellent as always, and a very young Liam Neeson gives a moving performance with only a handful of lines.

132,ponchodrummer,Mediocrity at best,3,18 August 2003,"I see from the other reviews that people had a lot of good things to say about this movie, and I'm not denying the cinematography or the score. The Mission was overall boring and incoherent. Whatever the movie was trying to say was muddled in all the lack of continuity or resolve. The movie brings up a conflict between two Jesuits, one who is for peace and one who is for war, when they are both under attack. The same fate behalls them both. This movie in not satisfying in the least. It is boring with a couple of good waterfall shots. I know it's not an action movie, but the action that is in the movie is goofy and the score doesn't help it at all, either. Sometime the score even comes to ridiculously dramatic crescendo for no apparent reason. The acting is all fine, but there truley is little. Again, the score is good, the cinematography is excellent, good acting, now you just need the movie to bring it all togethor. And the fight coordinator should be killed.",The Mission

It is truly of a quality which is to be aspired to. It is nuanced and expressive despite the weight of its themes, which are some of the most profound and relevant issues of the human condition ever wrestled with on film. Image and sound come together so beautifully with a story and characters which are the very model of narrative perfection. It is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of this film!

140,hager007,The Mission is one of the most powerful South American films about religion and colonialism.,9,30 April 2005,"The Mission was an amazing film for a myriad of reasons. First and foremost, the musical score showed why Ennio Morricone is a giant in the film industry. For this movie, Morricone displayed the serenity of the wind pipes and flutes beautifully. The soundtrack is one of my instrumental favorites. Secondly, the acting of both the Guarjani Indians with legends like Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro were amazing.I have to admit though, at times DeNiro did come across as a guy from Brooklyn stuck in the jungles of Paraguay, instead of the mercenary Mendoza. Thirdly, the sentimental value of the film is what really struck me. Whether one believes in the religious values of the Jesuits or not, the belief in G-d and love demonstrated in the movie were the film's epicenter. To see the growth of the Indians through trust in G-d were powerful. As Jeremy Irons sits and plays the flute to the anger of the Guarjani chief, until the end of the movie as the entire village walks into the Portuguese gunfire. To conclude, I will be spending part of my honeymoon in Foz De Iguazu on the Brazil/Paraguay border this December, the Guarjani struggle against the colonialists from Portugal will be on my mind as I reflect on ""The Mission.""",The Mission
141,skexis64,Compassion Surpasses Culture,8,22 April 2017,"It's rare to see a movie treat reverence with, well, reverence.This film treats viewers to one man's journey from being engaged with a crew of slavers to finally giving up his mercenary lifestyle and reaching out to members of a tribe of natives in order that he can fortify both his own life, and theirs. Mutual understanding is the goal of De Niro's character, Mendoza, but the tribe have been mistreated in the past, and they are distrustful of the initial hand of friendship he extends. This is partly because Mendoza has former ties to the slavers, and partly because he now represents an authoritative religion in the Jesuits.Though the Jesuits' (and the protagonist's) credo is beneficent, he must consistently work to earn their trust in the hopes that both groups of people will finally be able to engage with one another symbiotically. He brings them a view of the world that is rigid in some ways, but with enough humility from his travails and enough compassion to compromise when necessary.All is not well, however, because though Mendoza and his mentor, Father Gabriel eventually earn the trust of the Guarani, elements within the governments backing the two peoples are pushing for a sectarian approach to the land, and its people.Mendoza and his mentor eventually decide that what motivates them is a love for the people, rather than a rigid adherence to the institutions that caused the situation to spiral out of control. Their efforts and the fate of the people caught under the governmental territory dispute come to light only as the movie progresses.The performances of all actors and especially the soundtrack to this movie help make it a stunning period piece in the history of rapid religious and imperial expansion, and provide a somber look at how one man can, with diligence, empathy, and sincerity, build bridges that unify, and that send a message of hope for the future.",The Mission

I will skip criticism of some technicalities - language of Indians, using muskets in water and so on... Problem was that symbols were hitting into the face...nothing was left to imagine, to feel.

I had done previous study about the subject matter of this movie, and that was certainly a help. One comment I would like to make: It is not clear in the movie why the Indian community would disintegrate so completely in the end. In real life the reason was not so much militairy conquest, but rather the abolishment of the Jesuit order and the ensuing leadership vacuum. The locals had not provided their own chiefs for more than 200 years. As an audio/visual spectacle this movie rates very high with me, I have watched it often and with much pleasure.",The Mission

But, as the movie progressed, I was pleasantly surprised, and deeply moved by the beauty of the film. I not also mean that figuratively, but literally. The landscape was wonderful, and whilst the storyline was not a pleasant one, The Mission exceeded all my expectations . The symbolism runs rampant in this film, and my teacher, who could be considered mad, went to every length to point this out to us. The use of film techniques and music (wonderfully composed by Enrico Morricone - the theme song is now on the Sunsilk ad) added to what became for me a wonderful viewing experience. Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons were superb in their roles as the pertinacious yet confused Mendoza and the magnanimous Father Gabriel.

The film packs a punch in its contrast between the beauty of nature and human self-sacrifice on the one hand and the depths of human self-interest and ruthlessness on the other.  Its theme is as relevant today as it was in the 1600s - what are  the consequences of my actions, and what price must be paid by me and by others as a result?  The film depicts several characters with whose choices the viewer can identify - the missionary, the repentant killer, the papal legate - and gives no easy answers to the choices that confront them.  But the fact that there are no easy answers doesn't let them off the hook.  In the end, they all have to take responsibility for what they do or fail to do.The magnificent visuals of the Iguassu Falls and the moving score by Morricone (surely his best) all contribute to an unforgettable picture.",The Mission

The inevitable and tragic end leaves the viewer questioning not so much what is right, but how to achieve a righteous life. Further, it is a treat to see both Jeremy Irons' and Robert De Niro's deliver some of their best acting. Also of interest is seeing the early acting careers of both Liam Neeson & Aiodan Quinn.

152,hasko,Condensed history,9,13 June 2002,"While at college I was given the assignment of producing a 30 minute talk on the 'Guarana Republic' which is off course the subject matter of this movie. Hailing from the Protestant part of Europe I had never even heard about this aspect of Jesuit missionary work before, but as I researched the matter I became fascinated. So when I heard that a movie had been made about this topic I went to see it as soon as possible. Knowing how the film industry tended to treat historical events I was somewhat suspicious, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie instantly became one of my all time favourites. I think the subject matter is handled sensitively and sensibly and the cinematography is stunning. What also impressed me was the clever way in which this story, which in reality spanned several generations, was compressed into a period of about ten years without becoming unbelievable. Even in a two hour movie there is a limit on what one can touch on, but I think that a good balance between dialogue, adventure, action, and character development, was struck. Even so if the movie would have lasted another hour I would still have been happy (perhaps even happier).",The Mission

As a converted slave hunter, De Niro's character gets a first hand look at the wrongs of slavery. This movie really asks the question, what right do men have over one another? Philosophers Locke, Rousseau and Hobbes all contemplate this question themselves. In the movie the Portuguese, who wish to capture and enslave the natives, think of the native people as animals, not deserving of freedom. Only beasts in the state of nature. According to these philosophers, man has no natural right to other's freedom and in this movie, it is demonstrated how this must be true.

155,Rosteferious,Love or Hate it Thought-Provoking Film,9,20 April 2015,"The Mission contains all the ingredients needed to be a great film. It was spearheaded by Roland Joffe, a British film director, who wanted to take on another ambitious project like his previous film The Killing Fields (1984). It was shot by Oscar winning cinematographer (Chris Menges) who reunited with director Roland Joffe two years removed from the critically acclaimed film Killing Fields. It was written by a well-respected 2-time Oscar Winner screenwriter Robert Bolt. For those of you who do not know he wrote (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and A Man For All Seasons) three movies I have seen at least three times each. The film consisted of an all-star cast Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, and Ronald Pickup. There were upcoming actors people who be familiar with, but May not know Liam Neeson was in this and Aiden Quinn was in this. The cast is made up of the finest actors and extras any film crew could ask for to make a film of this magnitude. People reading this review should be familiar with a brilliant conductor, orchestrator, and composer by the name of Ennio Morricone who wrote the Oscar- Nominated worthy musical score of The Mission (1986). Morricone opened my eyes to the world of such beauty. As other readers, year after year, read this review and think what the heck was he blabbering about I may tune into one of his pieces and find myself in a trance unable to wake for a few minutes to a several minutes when listening to his composed scores. Ennio Morricone like all great composers can assemble a classical score that allows the audience to have a connection with the music. Each piece he has composed was specific for the movie he did, but every music score he has ever composed is symbolic. It represents how the audience can lose themselves in their thoughts and minds for a few minutes to a few hours. You may know some of his other works such as; The Man with No Name Trilogy (Dollars Trilogy), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), Cinema Paradiso (1988), and The Untouchables (1987). All of which got some recognition, but he has composed hundreds of other musical pieces that are considered masterpieces. When he dies he will be remembered always. If you ever heard one of Morricone's musical scores at least one of his musical scores would move your heart, your mind, and your body. It is not possible to not be moved when you listen to the beauty in his music he created. If you are not moved by any of his music you are either deaf or do not have an interest in music. The film revolved around the events of the Treaty of Madrid 1750; in which at the time Portugal and Spain were the so called ""Superpowers"" of the known world. Great Britain would become the ""Superpower"" shortly, but they would lag behind these two countries for now waiting their turn. Portugal and Spain were discovering new lands and colonizing these lands they discovered such as the continent of South America. Both countries wanted a part of South America so they happened to draw an imaginary line across the continent and determined who would control what boundaries. As history suggests to us countries will try to exploit anything possible to gain control of land and its resources for wealth, influence, and power. It seems the Spanish saw the tribes in their boundaries, the Guarani Indians, as potential converts to Christianity, while Portuguese saw the inhabitants as nothing more than animals, only appearing to look like a human in flesh. Portuguese wanted to use these Indians as slaves for slave labor when the Treaty of Madrid occurred; Spain ceding part of Jesuit Paraguay. Between what each country's government wanted and the Catholic Church the region was unstable for years. The film is about the work the Jesuit Priests are trying to accomplish in South America before and after the Treaty of Madrid was signed by Spain and Portugal in 1750. The Jesuit Priests unlike certain people tried to learn the inhabitants' culture and language before they tried to convert them to Christianity and set up missionaries. The Portuguese did no such thing to learn their culture as they felt they were inhuman and they could not be taught. I will not bore you with any more details as other reviewers have told you plenty about Robert De Niro's character Rodrigo Mendoza (a slave trader), Jeremy Irons character Father Gabriel (Jesuit Priest). Ray McAnally's character Cardinal Altamirano who must decide what missions will remain under the Church's protection and must be done away. He is sent by the Vatican to decide such matters. The film is full of moral social commentary, as it shows what happens when an unsuspecting/unwilling people are conquered. Did the Guarani Indians really want to be converted to Christianity? Are we to think a peaceful, remote colony of Guarani Indians left on their own for thousands of years really wanted to become westernized or found? Who are we to judge what culture is more superior? The Mission forces us to think about topics as well. What would you do if we were part of the Guarani Indians whose culture was taken from us? What would we take with us? Everyone has their own answers to these questions. The film is a timeless classic, but some people will see it not. If everyone who has a good heart or a functioning brain they will realize this film is not bad. The director of the film said this, ""The first two movies I made The Killing Fields (1984) and The Mission (1986), I loved making, but in some ways they've been an albatross round one's neck. Everybody thinks that's what you're supposed to be doing."" These two movies were huge projects unlike his small projects thereafter.",The Mission
156,mincha37072,The Mission's Battle,8,4 December 2004,"The Mission was absolutely one of the best films I have seen and I regret not having the privilege of watching this beforehand. Robert De Niro excellently portrays Mendoza, a converted Jesuit, whose former life reflects the convictions of his enslavement against the South American Indians. It is this conviction that leads him to defend these same Indians from slavery by engaging in a battle against the Portugese oppressors. Father Gabriel, played by Jeremy Irons, represents the polar opposite of Mendoza. A kind and thoughtful man, he instead resorts to a peaceful method of fighting for the liberty of the Indians through a silent and non-combative battle---through hymns and worship as opposed to guns and bloodshed. The treatment of these simple but strong-willed and determined Indians through slavery and disdain not only creates a sense of sympathy, but a heart felt agony towards their situation and rising anger aimed at the cruel indifference of the Catholic leaders, who had the power to stop such a tragic event. Ultimately, neither side truly wins, leaving a battered nation and a lost cause.What made this film even more impacting was the fact that it was based on true accounts. So the question arises: How could we as humans be so brutal towards others who have every right to freedom and happiness? A must see film that will open your eyes to the harsh reality of slavery and those who desperately fought for their rights. Though they lost the battle, their cry for equality lives within the chronicles of time. The actors played a wonderful role to tell the story of a torn civilization.",The Mission
157,norwegian_pi,Amazing!,10,4 January 2005,"Me and the Pope agree on this one: ""The Mission"" is my favorite film of all time. It's been nineteen years since this film was first released and it still continues to set the standard for serious historical dramas. It not only touched upon one of the most important issues of the 1980s (the debate over liberation theology that was currently taking place in Latin America), but also provided important historical context and raised haunting questions about war, pacifism and the power of forgiveness for the human soul. It's still hard to watch this film without tears. Irons is great and DeNiro gives perhaps the greatest performance of his stellar career. It's hard to believe that such a milestone in film-making has continued to be somewhat overlooked in discussions of the greatest films of all time.

It is loosely based on the drama ""Das heilige Experiment"" (The holy experiment) by Fritz Hochwaelder (which is very remarkable in another view, too: there is not a single female character in it).The gorgeous scenery and camera work, Morricone's aptly supporting music, and the good acting have been mentioned, too.It was said that the psychic whereabouts of the leading characters (I agree partially) and of the natives (I agree totally) were displayed too little.But in this movie, this is not very important, because the fate of the leading characters - though they carry the action - is not relevant: the crucial point is the fate of the Indians, who are sold into slavery by one catholic European government to another, with the approval of the pope who denies them to be real human beings. THIS is the outrageously inhuman pivotal point. The lead characters are just (more or less) idealistic pawns in the big atrocity; their private woes are trivial in relation to weight of the historical decision. So the film should have been centered more on the part of the dirty political and religious pundits, and on the battle of the Indians against cruel oppression. I even plead for more explicit gore here (which I rarely do), to make things clearer for watchers who learn more by their senses than by abstract reasoning. Here it is justified (like in ""Soldier blue""); this is not just a flick to kill time with, or to feast on violence, as ""Die Hard #17"" and the like. Instead, ""The mission"" has turned a bit of a de Niro festival.For this, and for some weaknesses in the narrative flow, I give it just 8 instead of 10 points.The matter of this film is not just an episode of history, long gone by and dead. It concerns the role of the catholic church in politics. There are parallels: just as the then pope let the Indians down in their desperate struggle, thereby securing his mundane power, pope John Paul II stopped and depraved of power the exponents of the ""Theology of Liberation"" in Latin America like Gustavo Gutiérrez, Dom Helder Camera, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, Ernesto Cardenal, Leonardo Boff, who felt urged to preach to not only pray but ACT in favour of the poor and miserable. (If you don't know what I mean, just see ""Romero"", which is about bishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, who was even shot dead for his commitment to the poor.) So the wealth of the rich is secured, and the poor keep living a bad life.The Jesuits, who - after a changing course of sometimes being the popes's elite fighters - had developed to becoming the catholic church's dedicated exponents of struggling for a socially better world some decades ago, culminating under their highly respected leader Don Pedro Arrupe, were depraved of power by John Paul II, in favour of and with the help of Opus Dei, a conservative order whose work brings things to get conserved as they are.And Joseph Ratzinger, the new pope - well, he was John Paul II.'s ""right hand"" for decades.",The Mission
159,weston-bouchard,Imperfect but beautiful,9,30 September 2021,"It's not a perfect movie, but it's a beautiful one. This movie is an example of what an excellent 'Christian movie' could be. It shows us the blackest of sins like church corruption, colonialism, slavery, greed and murder. Any Christian who watches this will be disgusted by what's done in the name of the church and in Jesus by the ruling authorities. Apparently some people thought it was an anti-Christian movie at the time of it's release.At the same time it shows the beauty of faith. What happens when one's life is transformed by Christ. How one can be selfless, forgive and turn the other cheek.

160,KallipsoRose,Stand Alone Classic,10,28 May 2015,"I just love this movie! I saw it when it first came out (I was about 7 years old) and to this day it is still one of my favorite films. It does a very good job at showing the relationship between beauty and pain in life and the relationships different groups of people have towards one another. In some ways there are so many messages and different lessons to be learned from this but I have always felt that the real message was resonating just under the surface waiting to be discovered. That is that every person should have the freedom to live and make their own choices. There is really a lot to take in from this one and it will leave you thinking which I love. The film is about the power struggle between the Portuguese and the Spanish while they are colonizing South America in the 1700s. The struggle is between the church and slave owners who are both on a mission to pillage the lands and ""civilize"" the natives through their own means. Throughout the movie there is this struggle of right and wrong and the journey of redemption. Everyone is self righteous and no one is right. You are able to love and hate the same characters or at least see the human aspect in them as well as the monster. It is a provocative movie because it asks a lot of hard questions and shows that even people with good intentions can cause mass destruction. Of course the irony is that the most civilized and worldly behavior was that of the Guarani. It is also an incredible unjust and heartbreaking film that taught me a lot about (in)equality from a very early age! I must also note that Roland Joffe is a great director and the Ennio Morricone/London Philharmonic provides one of the best movie soundtracks EVER!",The Mission
161,ptagg,"Exciting ethical common sense, excellent music and no moralist finger wagging",10,30 January 2006,"Set on the borders of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in 1750, this exceptional film tells a tragic tale of European colonialism that not only had direct relevance to foreign interference in Latin America at the time of the film's release in 1986 (Nicaragua, El Salvador, etc.) but also, and more positively, to developments in more recent times (Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina). Joffé's film features Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro, the latter in one of his best performances. It also features the Waunana people who, enacting the Guaraní Indians protected by humanist Jesuits but eventually massacred by colonialist mercenaries working for Portuguese slave traders, also stand out as the film's true stars: they present credible, tangible individuals and never come across as exotic extras. Another powerful performance is given by Roy MacAnally whose character, Cardinal Altimirano, embodies the dilemma of the ""good man"" trying to work within an oppressive system and whose strategic efforts to save the Jesuit order in Europe lead to an unpardonable bloodbath.Morricone's score for The Mission is exceptional. ""Come farne un tutt'uno?"" - how to make an integral whole out of two humanist music traditions (European and Native American) - was his problem. That he succeeded to fuse these convincingly is patent. For example, ""Gabriel's Oboe"", mixed with the syncretic choral ""Vita Nostra"" and with its lead played alternately by oboe and recorder (flauto diritto of quena type), became a favourite to play at Brazilian weddings, while the soundtrack album has been a major commercial success worldwide. Morricone draws on influences ranging from the European avant-garde (those Penderecki-like slithering string clusters with huge death-drum hits at the very start, for example) to the thoroughly singable (e.g. main theme), from baroque chamber music to the suggestive use of Native American sonorities. His music contributes massively to the thoroughly humanist message of this movie and I find it incomprehensible that the composer did not receive an Oscar for this score.

Since I am a catholic, unfortunately disappointed in the church institutionalism and attitude in many ways, I have to refer to the North America and Western Europe once again. As always, history repeats itself tirelessly and it did in the case of Croatia in 1991. The question is now, what connection have my country, my comment and the movie?

170,jyv993,"""The Mission"" Continues To Be My Personal Favorite",10,4 May 2006,"I have known this movie for many years now. I watch it every once in a while and only when I have a private moment to myself. In fact, I've just listened to the commentary on DVD. I can relate to every word, comprehension and motive of Roland Joffé's direction. He simply pieced together a great and touching movie.There are many comments about ""The Mission"" found here. Most of it positive while others not. Having said that, I don't want to get into the historical, religious and political views found here. After all, accurate or not, however with some relevancy, it was produced as a ""movie"" as opposed to a history book or in religious form.It is now May of the year 2006. The issue's and plight of the Indians or any other forest dwelling community is still a valid issue today as it was in 1986 or in the mid 1700's. The right to live and the will to survive is such a powerful force.""The Mission"" is a touching and emotional journey. Every scene is important and relevant to the next and flows smoothly from it's curious beginning to it's tragic end.Robert De Niro plays a character I can relate. Although not for profit, I have operated in forest environments, tracked targets and captured to win. It's dirty, it's tiresome but the ""rush"" of the hunt is fun. His transition is important as well. The people he has captured and/or has killed are the very people he becomes to love. When you know more about yourself and the world around you, everyone's life becomes important and one will fight to the death for others to survive.Jeremy Irons portrays a compassionate character whose love of the people I share. I am not a religious individual and that I don't claim any preference. I have traveled over the Atlantic, across the Pacific and to the Central America's. There's a lot many people can learn and share about each other.Chris Menges'is noted for his cinematography. There are many amazing and picturesque scenes. It reminds me of my own trek's in the wild and a very cold river bed. Keep in mind, seeing nature on screen or in your own professional/unprofessional landscape is one thing but the real experience can be quite different...trust me.Ennio Morricone is praised for his music composition orchestrated for The Mission. Although evident in the beginning and at the end, it is wonderfully played in subtle tones and variations throughout the movie. To my surprise, I found NO description in all the comments that lead to the evolution of this ""instrumental piece"" to it's present ""lyrical"" version found today.FYI. Mr. Ennio Morricone finally gave his approval to classical artist, Sarah Brightman (Phantom of the Opera), for the development of a song. Written in Italian lyrics by Ferraù, it became an international classical hit known as ""Nella Fantasia."" There are many classical artists who now sing their own variation of this song but my personal favorites are sung by Sarah Brightman (original artist) and Russell Watson. If you love the movie, you will love this song. Nella Fantasia greatly compliments The Mission.The Mission is not very everyone. You must experience the fullness of life to truly connect and feel for EVERY SCENE, DIALOGUE AND EXPRESSION. Otherwise...you just don't get it.",The Mission

172,bgraham-13,Very valuable movie,10,30 August 2006,"This movie works wonderfully on several levels. One, it could be said to be based loosely on the life of Bartolome de Las Casas, the contemporary of Columbus who originally went to the New World to take advantage of it, but became convicted in 1511 of the ""sin"" of the Spaniard's treatment of the indigenous populations and became the natives' greatest advocate, traveling back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean, pleading on their behalf before all who would listen, including the Pope. De Las Casas is considered to be one of the first anti-imperialists.Second, it could be said to be a powerful statement of liberation theology, which began to emerge in the 1950s, coming to full flower by the late 1960s. Produced in 1986, the philosophical struggle between arming oneself against oppression (De Niro) or ""turning the other cheek"" to that oppression (Irons) is portrayed in this movie as a non-choice: one must fight against the oppressor, even though The Church forbids it. This is the message of the liberation theology movement, which began with priests working in the barrio who saw their bishops and archbishops increasingly in bed politically and economically with the corrupt dictators who ruled their countries. These priests were faced with the dilemma of either fighting on behalf of their people, or obeying their superiors. Liberation theologists chose to fight on behalf of their people, much like the De Niro character.The fact that Father Daniel Berrigan plays a minor part in the picture is a nice touch. The Berrigan brothers, Daniel and Phillip, both Jesuit priests, took a courageous stand against the war in Vietnam, and paid for this stand with years in jail. They were part of the Catonsville Nine, which destroyed draft board records by, I believe, pouring blood on them. At one point, believe it or not, both priests were on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. Phillip died some years ago. Daniel is still alive.",The Mission

175,prt_747,This is an exceptional film,10,21 August 2007,"I first saw The Mission when I was sixteen years old and Ennio Morricone's haunting score as a backdrop to the visual leitmotif of Iguaçu Falls captured by the cinematography of Chris Menges's persist as some of my favorite cinematic moments. Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons successfully portray Jesuits in Paraguay prior to the Charles III's expulsion of the order from the Americas in 1767. The movie succeeds on various levels and perhaps is the best movie that Hollywood produced in the 1980's apart from Amadeus and the Last Emperor.This movie summarily is a morality play in which passive and violent resistance are contrasted. Robert Bolt, the script writer, avoids subscribing to either approach, but intelligently constructs a plot in which the conflict centers around whether violence against repression or passive resistance are a priori. In the end, neither of these approaches is sufficient and the Portuguese army slaughters the Guarani. I can't help but think that liberation theologians like Archbishop Oscar Romero, who the Salvadorian government murdered, influenced Bolt's consideration of this topic.As I perused other user comments, I believe critics of this film are turned off by the ""jolted dialogue"" and the ""under-developed characterization"". In truth, the dialogue is relatively sparse compared to other Hollywood movies and relies upon visual and musical motifs to communicate developments in the plot and characters--our indebtedness to Shakespeare's dialog driven plays perhaps prejudices us against other forms of communication. The use of apt imagery with terse but effective dialogue results in more than adequate character development in the Jesuits.The movie does not develop the Guarani and can be accused of reifying these people as noble savages. However the movie is about Jesuits and both native and non-native laymen are backdrops to the development of the conflicts exhibited in the priests played by DeNiro and Irons.I certainly recommend this movie as a great drama that presents interesting questions in a formally pleasing way.",The Mission

I wish he could have stopped trying to be so classicist for once and attempted to write something with some real verve). The acting was fine (bravo Robert De Niro for adding some real depth) but could have been enhanced by a more vibrant script. The endless shots of foliage and waterfalls I feel were distracting more than anything else. I mean, how interesting is a waterfall after you've seen 20+ shots of it? Really?

I especially love, what I consider, the culminating scene of the entire film, wherein the Guarini see the man that enslaved and killed them and instead of doing the same to him, they set him Free from the burden of his past sins! What a beautiful irony and the symbolism is exquisite! This was beautifully done by Joffe and the gift of crying for his sins and the utter abasement of his soul before God and all is shown so well! It was really a very touching scene when Jeremy Irons' character then rushes over to hug and comfort this wretched soul! Then the way Joffe shows DeNiro working amongst the people he had sought to enslave and their acceptance of him as a new man--stunningly portrayed! The healing laughter of the children playing jokes on him and laughing at him...something that his former pride-filled self could not tolerate is so well done. I cannot help but to think that Joffe must've prayed about the making of this movie to do such a good job on these above mentioned scenes.Unfortunately, I do agree with other reviewers that the movie went downhill from there. But, as a former missionary myself, I can avow to the fact that this film is very much alive in the hearts of thousands of brave missionaries throughout the world (not just Catholic priests and nuns but the protestant missionaries too who also love this film) and they will talk of the beauty of this film for many years to come!",The Mission

Apparently there exist some people who don't understand what this movie wants to talk about. And the numbers are far greater than expected. As a 10 years old boy watching this movie first time, I could see the obvious conflict between the strong and the weak because, obviously it was clearly shown in the movie as gunfights and killings. Yeah, I had average intelligence of a young boy. And I was bored by this movie. (I was only 10 years old after all.) Some people still see only as much as young me, with tons of historical and political knowledge they gathered in their lives and described in their review. This movie isn't about wars and politics. Strictly speaking this movie isn't even about the religions. What this movie speaks about are forgiveness - self forgiveness -, love - the true love that we will never understand -, and most of all, the path - the path we should choose some day.

This movie isn't about the obvious war which is just a background story, but about the parallel conflict between Rodrigo Mendoza and Father Gabriel, which represent unending war in our conscience.I know exactly why the Godfather has highest rating and I appreciate it so much.

182,ecarpenter23,The Mission Disapoints,5,28 November 2014,"Back in 1984, Roland Joffe accomplished the near impossible; his major motion picture debut, The Killing Fields, defied every expectation typically associated with neophyte filmmakers and what Joffe delivered was one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. So it's no surprise I highly anticipated his follow-up film, The Mission, and it's obvious that by bringing back the same team (producer David Puttnam, cinematographer Chris Menges, and editor Jim Clark), they attempted to capture the proverbial ""lightning in a bottle"" a second time. Unfortunately, the end product isn't quite cinematic magic. Set in the 18th century, Jeremy Irons stars as Father Gabriel, one of several Spanish Jesuit priests (including Liam Neeson) assigned to convert the Guarini tribe of South America into Christians. His efforts are gradual, but successful. Converging with this story is Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro), a slave trader who seeks penance after killing his own brother in a fit of rage. For all the Guarini that he has killed or sold off into slavery, they still show compassion and forgiveness towards him, and he is accepted into the mission, even converting into a Jesuit priest under the guidance of Father Gabriel.The priests and the Guarini natives eventually find themselves in heated discussion with politicians and slave-owners, who are debating over whether the mission should fall under the rule of Portugal, thus endangering all the Guarini with the possibility of being made into slaves. Determined to prevent such an action at any cost, Mendoza takes up his sword once more, coming into conflict with Father Gabriel's peaceful approach.The Mission was released in 1986 with little success in theaters, despite garnering a respectable 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Since then, it's developed a devoted fan base who consider it among the most underrated films of the decade. As much as I'd like to, I can't quite agree. Though a respectable and often beautifully crafted effort, the film ultimately comes up short in human interest and emotions, with Joffe often favoring lingering shots of lush jungle scenery and needlessly overlong political machinations involving secondary characters whom we couldn't care less about.The film is divided into three acts, the first, involving the spiritual transformation of Mendoza, is easily the most compelling. Despite De Niro's occasionally stilted performance (his delivery of some of the dialogue, particularly ""Are you laughing at me?"" still makes me cringe), his emotional torment is heartfelt and absorbing and his acceptance into the mission is genuinely moving. It's almost all downhill from there.The build-up in the second act is initially effective, with the heated debate over the Guarini engrossing, but the conflict eventually loses steam when we're subjected to dull, endless dialogue that grows inadvertently confusing even as it intends to clear up the matters at hand. It's also in the middle segment the film loses its human focus and all that's really left is the question of will they or won't they fight.The third act is the inevitable battle, and while there are a few powerful moments amidst the chaos, the sequence is a badly choreographed mess. The editing also feels a little rough, with quite a few scenes feeling like they clocked in a little too soon (the sudden transition after Irons' ""God is love!"" line is disjointed, to say the least). The Guarini are never developed beyond the typical ""noble savage"" portrayal, so it's difficult to feel for their plight beyond the fact that their forced subjugation and mass slaughter is a heinous crime. I wanted to feel more for them, but they're merely a backdrop for the more seasoned cast.As Father Gabriel, Jeremy Irons is superb, unquestionably one of the film's consistent bright spots. It's unfortunate he's never that well-developed in any of the film's separate acts, but his performance alone is able to draw us in even if the script lets him (and the audience) down. In supporting roles, Ray McAnally and Liam Neeson are excellent, though a bit limited in screen time. For Neeson, this was more of a hint of greater things to come.Ennio Morricone's score deserves a special mention; whatever emotions Joffe is unable to convey on screen, Morricone's music can conjure in just a few notes. It's one of the most beautiful scores I've had the pleasure to listen to, especially in segments with oboe and flute. The chorus in the background is perhaps a bit much, but an overpowering score can do wonders in a film otherwise unable to muster all the intended emotions. Joffe's work in the film is still overall quite solid, but he completely lost his footing soon afterward, losing a grip on his career with a long string of critical and financial disasters, including Super Mario Bros., The Scarlet Letter, and Goodbye Lover. I'm convinced The Killing Fields was not a fluke, but the sign of a genuine auteur who showed his prowess thanks to a brilliant script and cast. Blend those two elements with his natural skills and I'm sure we'll get a film worthy of mention alongside his debut. Let's just hope this happens sooner rather than later.",The Mission
183,camurso_,"So, so beautiful",10,6 May 2005,"When I first saw this movie, the first thing I remembered was thinking: ""Hey, I know this song! But from where..."". Then I remembered, the score is from my childhood. Every morning, my parents listened to a radio station and at 7:58 A.M. there was a show where a priest said some thoughts and this music was played.Well, what can I say about this movie? It is beautiful, one of the most beautiful ones I ever saw in my 27 years of existence.The story, even not being accurate (the Portuguese never massacred the Indians, but the Spanish did - but it really is not important to tell who did what. The important is to say that it was done, so let's not forget it never), is simple. There is a conflict of interests. The Spanish want slaves, the Portuguese can get some and the Church does not want to lose the power it has in Europe. And, as always, there are innocent who pay the bill.Jeremy Irons is a priest that risks his own life so that the Guarani can know the Word of God. He believes that love is stronger than the sword. And believes that until the end.De Niro is a trade slaver who kills his own brother due to a woman. ""A woman!"" said Jack Nicholson in ""Batman"". Was that motive strong enough to do that? I don't believe so neither did he, because of the grief he felt and that almost killed him.The stronger moment in the film is the forgiveness of the Guarani to Mendonza (De Niro). They forgave what he had done to them. And what a scene that is. We can't say if De Niro is laughing or crying, maybe both, maybe none. Sometimes, when my life is not happy and something good happens, I wish I could do the same he did because I could cast all my sadness away.I dare everyone to watch this movie and say that never felt a bit touched by it's beauty.10/10",The Mission
184,raydesya,In my Top 10,10,10 May 2012,"Cinema at it's best. This is one of my absolute all-time favourites. The only reason I can see anyone ever not giving it 10/10 is that it has a tragic climax. I say we need more tragedies in film, if only to balance out the overwhelming tsunami of persistent and formulaic fluff at the multiplex. Fans will already know, but the same writer for The Mission, Robert Bolt, also wrote Ryan's Daughter, Laurence of Arabia, A Man for All Seasons, the Bounty, and Doctor Zhivago. It has one of the greatest stories of redemption in movie history. It's drop-dead gorgeous to watch, the acting is incredible and it stars Robert De Niro. Seriously, what more can you ask for? A few laughs? Some hot chicks? A happy ending? If you can live without these and have not seen The Mission, go for it, you will not be disappointed.",The Mission
185,rckjones,A Clash of World-Views,9,14 November 2012,"At its heart, ""The Mission"" showcases a conflict of world-views between those who operate with a Hobbsian mentality (the Portuguese and Spanish nationals) and those who operate with a world-view more closely resembling Rousseau's (the Jesuit missionaries). This is summarized in the closing exchange of the movie between Don Hontar and Cardinal Altamirano: ""We must work in the world; the world is thus,"" says Hontar following the massacre. The Cardinal replies, ""No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it."" Is the natural state one of war of all against all, or did is the state of war something created in spite of man's peaceful nature? The movie offers a picture that could support both world-views.The movie opens with the Guarani killing their first visiting priest, but it closes with a Garden of Eden-like scene of children rowing through the wreckage of war into the peace of the jungle. The European colonists practice slavery (which is a Hobbsian symbol of the strong ruling the weak), but Father Gabriel denounces this and provides the Guarani with sanctuary and education, in the belief that before God, all are equal. Finally, even within the ranks of the Jesuits, there is a difference in world-view when the final conflict comes, and the European soldiers storm the mission to forcibly remove the residents. The former slaver Mendoza believes the mission should be defended with force, while Father Gabriel believes that it should be defended peacefully. Even Cardinal Altamirano's lose-lose decision is an ethical question of strong against weak: should he side with the Jesuits and their mission of peace, or the colonists and their mission of war? Is it better to preserve the safety of a few natives, or preserve the integrity of the Catholic church? ""The Mission"", then, is a film that sets up these ethical dilemmas and allows them to play out: self-interest versus self-sacrifice and guilt versus forgiveness.This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I would highly recommend it as a film that will challenge you and leave you thinking about these things for days and weeks afterward.",The Mission
186,starguy7070,horrible,1,16 August 2013,"The Mission tells the story of the effects of the Treaty of Madrid on native South American tribes and the Jesuits working to convert them. While this is a solid plot for a film, Roland Joffé displays the worst directing I have ever seen-a monkey could have done better-making this film complete trash. One of the more palpable failures was the sound track, a simple oboe tune that plays throughout the entirety of the film, which threatens to cause even the most energetic audiences to fall into a coma, the only purpose this film serves is putting hyper children into a deep sleep. This film does not display an actual antagonist but rather has characters that reinforce the idea of the unseen malicious presence of Portugal when done correctly this plot works well, but the poor execution and lack of explanation only serve in making the film more confusing. Even though this film was released in 1986 the effects are dreadful from bullets that leave a large circular hole when they enter with no exit wound nor blood splatter to actors looking down at the arrows already protruding from their chest as if they had just noticed them. The dreadful effects are only made more prevalent by the terrible acting watching these actors attempt to perform an emotional scene made me want to cry.I am disappointed that a film with so much potential was produced in such a disgraceful manor.",The Mission
187,andrewhoward0,superb,8,27 June 2006,"As a fan of De Niro it was great to see him play the role of Rodrigo Mendoza, and make it his own. Alongside a terrific performance from Jeremy Irons, the film will stay with me for a long time. A film i haven't heard much about before, and certainly not mentioned as one of De Niro's best but in my opinion it is up there with The Deer Hunter and Taxi Driver. The contrast in the characters of Irons and De Niro is portrayed beautifully, and yet the similarities in their courage,determination, and belief in their methods in almost identical.Aidan Quinn and Liam Neeson make up the more familiar names in the cast, and both give great performances in their own right, particularly Neeson, in his earliest film that I've seen. Superb Film!",The Mission
188,tmilou,A masterpiece,10,9 April 2016,"I had never even heard of this film when a friend recommended that I watch it. So I did and I'm so glad I did. It is by far the most truly spiritual film that I know of. It deals both with redemption and hypocrisy in ways that ring so true it is soul-shaking. It make you feel, think, and hope in ways that few movies do. And aside from all of that, it's just such a well-made movie! The cinematography is gorgeous and the music may be one of the most beautiful I've ever heard in any genre. And the acting, so good. It's rare that movies with religious films get this level of talent in front of the camera and it makes all the difference. Personally, it's one of my favorite DeNiro performances of all time. This film is something special and definitely worth a couple hours of your life!",The Mission
189,daswift,Boring,1,26 September 2008,"Have just watched the DVD of The Mission; the scenery may be very beautiful but this does not distract from the fact that this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I really don't know how to fill ten lines here, but the film makers managed to fill a whole hour with almost nothing. I'm just glad that I didn't pay to see the film in the cinema; I watched it at a friends and left after an hour. I'm afraid that nice music and beautiful scenery can't make up for a poor film, though I have to admit that I couldn't bear to watch the final sixty six minutes. I was so little enthused by what I saw that I perhaps missed the best of the film - or perhaps I didn't.",The Mission
190,tygab,One of the best movies I've seen,10,18 December 2005,"It may well be due to the soundtrack which is absolutely outstanding. But the cinematography is quite well done. And the story is a reasonably good rendering of a complex historical issue. I do not currently have it in my collection but I hope to add it soon. However the soundtrack has never been far from my CD player (now perma-loaded on my ipod). It's been years since I last saw the film yet many of the details of the film are still vivid in my mind. While there are a few films which I like on an equal level, I am hard pressed to think of a film better than The Mission. I would place it on my list of top 20 movies for a well rounded individual to have seen, and certainly think anyone interested in quality though provoking films would enjoy this one.",The Mission
191,Toshinald,"One Love, One Movie",10,21 September 2006,"I have noted a tirade of applause to this movie so far in all of its comments. I can openly say I have cried and will cry again to this film, not a blubbering cry but an emotional tear down the eye cry.The movie is emotionally moving, the soundtrack as well as plucking the strings of a violin also pluck's on the heartstrings.If you do watch it prepare for an emotional assault. This is by far one of, if not the top film in my all time favourite list, and there are a lot of them to compete against.I listen to the soundtrack in work and have to stop myself from welling up with tears.A masterpiece if ever there was one!",The Mission
