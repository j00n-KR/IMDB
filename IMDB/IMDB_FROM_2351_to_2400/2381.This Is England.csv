0,TheLittleSongbird,Terrific film,9,15 February 2011,"From Shane Meadows come This is England, a terrific film that is especially elevated by some wonderful performances. The film looks great, it is both bleak and authentic in its setting and the photography compliments it beautifully. The script is funny, touching and terrifying, and Meadows directs with aplomb.I was quite impressed with the story too. The first half is heart-warming and also funny and touching, then when the tone shifts it is more foreboding and bleak perhaps. Perhaps the tone shift could have been introduced a little slower so that it didn't feel so abrupt, because even I was quite shocked at the quite sudden shift.The pace I have no problem with either, and the period the film is set in is brilliantly evoked. No qualms with the acting either, Thomas Turgoose is a superb lead and Stephen Graham is equally brilliant. All in all, terrific. 9/10 Bethany Cox",This Is England
1,Leofwine_draca,A mini masterpiece,10,25 March 2014,"THIS IS ENGLAND is a superb film - straight from the heart and unflinching in its depiction of urban racism in 1980s Thatcherite England. Shane Meadows certainly cemented himself as one of our country's most engaging talents with the double whammy of this and DEAD MAN'S SHOES, two excellent films which require and reward repeat viewing.Somewhat autobiographical in its intentions, THIS IS ENGLAND makes for a nostalgic viewing experience for us children of the 1980s. The cast of oddball characters are thoroughly engaging and the reactions between them are completely true to life. Of the cast, the experienced likes of Joseph Gilgun are as good as you'd expect, but the real triumph comes from the heartfelt and poignant performance of Thomas Turgoose, the lovable lead.The film starts off as a funny slice-of-life drama but gradually things take a darker turn with the introduction of a skinhead gang. Stephen Graham's turn as a psychotic skinhead gang leader is absolutely electrifying and one of the most gripping I've seen in a long while. His final scene is particularly dramatic and, indeed, one of the most powerful I've seen depicted on film. Altogether this is a great movie and good enough for me to consider tracking down the TV series follow-ups.",This Is England
2,SnoopyStyle,amazing kid in specific story,9,14 August 2016,"It's July 1983. Shaun Fields is small in stature with a giant chip on his shoulder. He lost his beloved father in the Falklands. He gets thrown out by the Pakistani shopkeeper and gets into a fight in school. He is befriended by Woody and his gang. They get into minor mischief and friendly mayhem. Shaun gets Smell as his girlfriend. His mother won't buy him Dr. Martens. The group is disrupted by Combo returning from prison. Combo takes over leadership as he pushes his white power agenda. Woody, Jamaican Milky, and others leave but Shaun falls for Combo. Combo takes the group to a National Front meeting with the call ""This is England"".The kid is amazing and no punches are pulled. Shane Meadows puts his soul into this. The music is terrific. All the characters are vivid and specific highlighted by Combo and Woody. There is a sparse power and intensity to the story.",This Is England
3,Prismark10,Out for a clash,5,23 February 2017,"This is England is a slice of life nostalgia for the skinhead brigade. Set in the summer of 1983, it is a coming of age tale of Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) a 12 year old lad in a working class estate whose father died fighting in the Falkland's war.In one day he gets picked on several times and later gets befriended by a local gang of assorted street kids, some of whom are skinheads. They are into ska, reggae and new wave music and spend their time committing vandalism. Shaun endears himself to their leader Woody and gets accepted by them. For the first time in a long while he is having fun being part of that gang.When Woody's friend Combo (Steven Graham) returns after a spell in prison things quickly change. Combo experienced racism in jail, he joined up with white extremists and upon release he advocates racist and nationalist views even going to National Front meetings. Woody who is more apolitical and has a black friend wants nothing to do with him.Shaun and a few others ally with Combo but he is a ticking time bomb. Pretty soon they are threatening the local Asian kids and robbing the Asian shopkeeper armed with a machete (who somehow never called the police.) You figure that pretty soon, Combo will do serious harm to someone.Director Shane Meadows does a good job in recreating the early 1980s scene in his film from art direction to costume design. It is obvious he recalls this era well. However there is nothing in the story I found intriguing or even surprising.I am at a loss why so many critics became so orgasmic over this film unless they got some kind of perverted arousal to see scenes of young Asian lads playing football being threatened by a grown up white bully with a knife. Maybe secretly they sided with Combo and wanted their country back!Being a teenager myself in that era I met these kind of nationalist skinheads, always complaining why they were doing poorly and others doing better than them. They were always threatening people who were younger than them or making sure they outnumbered them first before beating them up. Even now over 30 years later they are still moaning and laying blame to whatever immigrant groups they can point to for their own failures.Meadows elicits good performances from a young cast but I was left nonplussed with the script and thinking about it we had many similar shows on television in the 1980s such as Going Out which starred Perry Benson who also features in this movie.",This Is England
4,lee_eisenberg,I hope that at least most movies from England are somewhat like this.,9,24 December 2007,"England has released many films about people living a grim existence: ""Poor Cow"", ""Kes"", ""The Full Monty"", ""24 7"", ""Billy Elliot"" and ""Children of Men"", to name a few. Shane Meadows's ""This Is England"" has a similar concept, but takes a different approach.Set in 1983, the movie focuses on young Shane (Thomas Turgoose). His father was killed in the Falklands invasion, and so he lives alone with his mother Cynthia (Jo Hartley). Picked on at school, Shaun feels lost in the world...until he meets some skinhead punks. As Shaun gets to know these skinheads, the group becomes a sort of father figure to him. While Cynthia remains ambivalent about her son hanging out with such individuals, it comforts her - however loosely - that her son has found some friends.So, the first half of the movie makes it look rather lightweight. But when hardcore skinhead Combo gets out of jail and reconnects with the group, everything changes. In what I considered the movie's most effective scene, Combo stands up in front of the gang and talks about how Margaret Thatcher led the country into a phony war while unemployment runs rampant and immigrants steal everyone's jobs. This guy's such a racist nationalist, that he won't even fly the Union Jack representing the United Kingdom; to him, the only flag is England's own flag (showing St. George's cross).Whether or not this speech was intended as an allusion to current events I'm not sure. The movie maintains its strength in not meandering too much. While there is talk of the Falklands invasion, the focus stays on Shaun's friendship with the gang and how they get him to cooperate with whatever they do. It's worth noting that even though these skinheads are clearly disaffected youth, they stick by each other no matter what, to the extent that Shaun becomes very close to one of the girls in the gang.All in all, I recommend this one. While some people may not fancy a look into this kind of subculture, I find it very fascinating. And above all, I like movies disproving the ""Mary Poppins"" image of England. Definitely worth seeing.",This Is England
5,jboothmillard,This Is England,8,25 November 2008,"Based on the semi-auto-biographical experiences of writer/director Shane Meadows (Once upon a Time in the Midlands, Dead Man's Shoes), this was a film I heard about from the poster, and I'm really glad I watched it. Basically it is 1983, during Thatcher's reign and after the Falklands War, twelve year old Shaun Fields (introducing Thomas Turgoose) is a lonely boy growing up in a Grimsby coastal home with his mother Cynthia ""Cynth"" (Jo Hartley). After a fight at school, Shaun passes a gang of skinheads sitting in a tunnel, leader Woody (Joe Gilgun) feels sorry for Shaun and invites him to join them. Shaun initially refuses because of Gadget (Andrew Ellis) being mean, but eventually he accepts a second invite to join them, gets himself some checkered shirts, braces, high boots, and of course a shaved head, and becomes part of the gang. The rest of the gang Shaun hangs with includes Milky (Andrew Shim), ""girlfriend"" Smell (Rosamund Hanson) and Lol (Vicky McClure), and during the summer holidays they wreck abandoned houses, playing football and much more. This fun is spoilt however by the arrival of dangerous, racist, militant and psychotic Combo (Stephen Graham), returning home from prison, he has very strong feelings about the ""war"" going on. With Combo, Shaun is taken into an uncomfortable world, with the original gang breaking away, and the new criminal like group committing violent crimes and going against the system. In the end, Shaun finally realises he is in the wrong environment when Combo beats Milky almost to death, they take him to hospital, his mother comforts him, and he throws his St. George's flag into the sea. Also starring Jack O'Connell as Pukey Nicholls, Perry Benson as Meggy, George Newton as Banjo and Frank Harper as Lenny. Turgoose is fantastic as the young lead, Graham is brilliant at being almost evil, all the supporting cast do their parts well too, many of the scenes are realistic according to the time setting, it is disturbing but essential viewing, a great British drama. It won the BAFTA for Best British Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay for Meadows. Very good!",This Is England
6,rmax304823,Frustration/Aggression.,7,2 December 2011,"This above-average biographical drama of growing up in the lower-class English skids at first seems like a curious combination of ""The 400 Blows"" and ""Quadrophenia."" It's 1983 and this is the story of a young boy, about twelve, who falls in with a gang of older, nascent skinheads during the Falkland Islands War.It's almost like a documentary as we follow this rag tag group of funny-looking adolescent boys and girls around, cussing, drinking beer, entering abandoned housing projects and smashing everything in sight, smoking dope in somebody's apartment that seems to be furnished entirely with cushions and mattresses and posters. That apartment, by the way, surely belonged to somebody but I couldn't quite make out who, because the accents were unfamiliar and sometimes indecipherable. At least some of the must have jobs but we never see any of them working or in a school room.The twelve-year old, Thomas Turgoose, does a pretty good job in the role of freshman gang member. They maul him playfully at first, then put him through a rite de passage. He gets his head shaved and begins to wear the proper gear. He's a feisty kid too -- gets along with his Mom, but his Dad has just been killed in the Falklands and he's sensitive about it. He and the gang have an unfocused energy and, ridden with testosterone as teens tend to be, there's anger in the emotional emulsion. It's ready to morph at any moment, like a supercooled liquid.This comes about with the appearance of Stephen Graham, an old friend of the gang members, who barges into one of the parties and more or less takes it over. He's been behind bars for three and a half years, lusting over one of the gang's girls whom he had boffed. It was the most memorable night of his life, he tells her. She's shocked and repelled because she was sixteen then and all juiced up. Now she's approaching twenty and has to be at work in two minutes. When he clumsily tells her he's thought of nothing but her while imprisoned, he loves her, and he gives her a shabby little wooden box as a gift, she responds with indifference and leaves him at once to hurry off to her job.Graham sits alone in his car, huffing and puffing, and doing a good job of convincing us that he's going to explode like a zit. The scene may be a little overdone. It's like giving us a telegraph message. But in fact, Graham's role is the most complex and demanding, and he handles it with subtlety. He can be brutal, but he's a natural leader too -- sentimental, apologetic when he's wrong, even-handed, and inspiring when he's inflamed by an idea. The idea turns out to be nationalism. He hated Pakis. He believes the Falkland Islanders should be left to handle their own affairs. They're not part of this sceptered isle. His motto is simple, he tells the others: ""This is England."" One of the group happens to be a fully assimilated Jamaican whom Graham has accepted as an equal. Now, rebuffed by his girl, the simian Graham beats him to death.In 1939, John Dollard and his colleagues at Yale developed the controversial frustration-aggression hypothesis, in which the former leads to the latter, and the latter is impossible without the former. The more frustrated you are, the more angry you become. And, if the original target is unavailable or impractical, you displace the aggression onto a more available victim. It's like the guy who gets fired and comes home and kicks his dog. We've all been there. We don't kill anybody or kick the dog but when we're tangled up with the computer we're more likely to be rude and shout, ""Don't interrupt me!"" or ""Not NOW, for God's sake!"" It's an engaging movie after the first quarter of an hour, during which we watch this ordinary half-formed kid walk around, sit by himself in a wrecked dinghy, and mope, wondering what to do with himself. The skinheads provide what at first seems a satisfying answer -- get new clothes and a haircut. If you can get through the sluggish opening and the sometimes impenetrable speech, you'll appreciate the effective direction and the nicely handled performance by the feral Graham, with his shiny knob and that delicate spider web tattooed on the side of his neck. Those bald heads I must forgive, just as I forgive the duck tails of the 50s and the post-Beatle long hair of the 70s and the return of the shiny pates in the 90s. Those are accidents. It's the essences that are sometimes noisome. Some of us are readier to kick the dog than others.",This Is England
7,BA_Harrison,A Grade-A drama with a Grade 1 haircut.,8,27 May 2017,"I'm English. I turned 15 in 1983. It wasn't a great time for me. Taking a trip down memory lane with This Is England didn't seem like a particularly appealing idea, but with director Shane Meadows (Dead Man's Shoes) in charge, I was sure I would be impressed regardless of the subject matter. As I expected, the general atmosphere of the film is bleak and depressing, the disaffected characters spewing anger and hatred. Thankfully, Meadows' superb handling of his material, and his exceptional cast's wonderful performances, make this look back at not-so-great Britain compelling viewing. And somewhere, in amongst all of the violence and emotional turmoil, there is even a faint glimmer of hope.Based on Meadow's own personal experiences growing up in England in the '80s, the film is steeped in realism, the era perfectly recreated in all of its miserable glory. Thomas Turgoose puts in a very impressive turn as central character Shaun, the young schoolboy who falls in with a gang of skinheads, but for me, the standout performance comes from Stephen Graham as bitter ex-con skinhead Combo, a thuggish brute whose own personal issues have made him into a volatile racist prone to explosive outbursts of violence. And yet, despite all of the despicable things he says and does, Graham's character actually warrants a modicum of pity, the bloke clearly a product of his own troubled upbringing — it's a memorably moving performance in another solid film from Meadows.",This Is England
8,Quinoa1984,England is this,9,11 November 2014,"This is England is a hard-hitting look at an outsider's youth, and what comfort comes when there are others around - however it may be a brutal sort of 'others' as here. I liked Meadows' unflinching camera, his use of close-ups on faces, the ska music (unexpected that, I thought it'd be skin-head punk rock but only UK Subs shows up), and the performance by newcomer Thomas Turgoose, and Stephen Graham, who seems to be in every British film right now.I wondered why the film just ended the way it did, where it seemed like there was more story to tell, or at least a resolution to go after (and subsequently I learned Meadows did TV spin-off since the film's release with many of the same characters - which is fine, though as a film in and of itself it feels incomplete somehow, even with a predictable ending of a flag thrown in a river).All the same, it's riveting, raw, personal cinema that can resonate with any youngster that's ever felt they didn't 'fit in' - or that they found a place to fit in, whatever the circumstances.",This Is England
9,edwagreen,This is England-Union Jack at its Worst ***,7,21 September 2008,"Here we go again. An 11 year old loses his dad in 1983 in the Falklands War. Bullied in school and very unhappy with his life, our young chap, who gives a wonderful performance, is recruited by a bunch of skin-headed losers. He resorts to violence. My criticisms of the film include his mother who scolds the group for keeping her son late and then goes on her merry way and the boy becomes a bona fide member.The film wants us to evoke sympathy for this brat. Yes, I call him a brat because of his actions. Not everyone who loses a parent at 11 resorts to such behavior. Let's stop making excuses for this type of recalcitrant conduct.The film does have redeeming value when the boy sees the death of a black member by the leader is a rage caused by the use of drugs.

12,Theo Robertson,Meadows Shoots Himself In The Foot,6,7 September 2010,"Shane Meadows is a great example of a British film maker who is talented but who fails to maximise that talent . Where as Danny Boyle is often criticised for failing to maintain the first half momentum Meadows is slightly different in that he can come up with a good premise which he then proceeds to demolish via his own hand . Where as DEAD MANS SHOES quickly stops being gritty and realistic and becomes fantastical and silly TIE suffers from quickly turning from a heart warming film in to a mouth piece for Meadows which defeats the object of the exercise .Make no mistake this is a truly heart warming film for the first half hour . Set in Grimsby in July 1983 tweleve year old Shaun is an outsider . He is an orphan whose father died in the Falklands conflict the previous year . He is the butt of jokes from school bullies and on his way home he is befriended by a group of non racist skinheads who invite him to tag along with them . Even the most cynical heart can't fail to be touched by this scenario which is helped greatly by all the cast , especially Thomas Turgoose as Shaun and Joe Gilgun as skin head leader Woody . Watching it a few short years after the film was released you can still understand why the critics loved it and heaped praise on the unknown cast and there's still plenty of time for Turgoose and Gilgun to become household names . If this is what they're capable of they're deserving of stardom Unfortunately when the audience are introduced to racist skinhead Combo the film starts to fall apart . There's nothing wrong with Stephen Graham's performance and will hopefully join Turgoose and Gilgun on the road to stardom but as a three dimensional character from 1983 he's sadly lacking . Meadows is on record as saying that he didn't agree with the Falklands war . I'm surprised he is able to remember since he was ten year old at the time and one can't help thinking that it's Meadows who is talking every time Combo opens his mouth "" we went in to that war on a lie . it was for nothing "" Hmmmm how does Combo arrive at this conclusion ? It's not like Mrs Thatcher addressed the houses of parliament saying that Argentina was days away from invading the Falkland Islands in a similar manner Blair did with Iraq . It was a war of aggression by Argentina who at the time were led by a fascistic junta . For people to claim "" The Falklands Conflict was due to a lie "" is very anachronistic not to mention untrue . By a bitter irony The Falklands Conflict is one of he very few wars where the extreme right and extreme left in Britain disagreed . The extreme right was for sending the task force the far left were against it . As Nick Cohen and Christopher Hitchens continually point out with glee Neanderthal Nazis and gormless do gooders are nearly always on the same side In fact one can't help wondering why on earth it is set in the Summer of 1983 . If Shaun had been orphaned in 2004 and the story took place in 2005 then you'd still have the exact same film . Perhaps this was Meadows intention but decided having a film set against the background of Iraq and Afghanistan because it might be too similar to DEAD MANS SHOWS . . Meadows wasn't a teenager in 1983 and it shows . Anachronims abound like Strawberry Switchblade on the radio and Blockbusters on TV and how could the Summer of 1983 not have Blue Monday by New Order being played at every opportunity ? If you're going to make a film set in a particular time then please let someone who was there direct it . Since Meadows has decided to bring up politics I'll rubbish him by asking what on earth was the point in showing footage of the miners strike which took place from March 1984- March 1985 ? If political events take place AFTER the timeline the scenario is set then please don't include them In conclusion TIE had all the potential to be one of the great feel good movies ever to have come out of Britain a sort of THE FULL MONTY meets LITTLE VOICE and the way the film quickly becomes something "" gritty and realistic "" is somewhat unforgivable . Some people think they've been misled in thinking this was going to be a Brit version of American HISTORY X and I can see their point and one can't help thinking how much more praise Meadows might have received if we'd never have met Combo and we'd had Shaun , Woody and co walking off in to the sunset friends forever",This Is England
13,dbborroughs,Beautifully acted film of a boy trying to find his place in life is a very real film thats often quite affecting,7,18 August 2007,"Wonderfully acted and affecting tale of a boy who's father has been killed during the Falkland Island War. With no real friends he falls in with a bunch of skinheads and finds the family he never had.I don't know what to say. This is a very good film. It plays like snippets from a slice of life at times. The dialog is crisp and sharp and feels real, these are real people, or so it seems from the across the board excellent performances. Its stunning. If there is a problem with it its that at times it never really feels connected. Yes, its Sean's story and yes we watch his arc, and yes the individual scenes are perfect, but at the same time they don't feel full connected. Something is missing. But I'm quibbling, this is a really well acted film that deserves to be seen.(One question, why does it seem that a huge chunk of English films seem to dwell in the same sort of low class environment? The film reminds me of a good number of other English films from the 1980's. Its either low class Britain or Merchant Ivory upper class stuff. Why is that? I know its not true, but the films we remember all look the same.Is England really that bland?)",This Is England

They rip off a store owner and tag tunnels, but mostly, they just spout nonsense and get high.

They happen to be skinheads and are possibly not the best influence on Shaun...Great movie. Powerful examination on neo-Nazi, bigoted, skinhead culture in the UK in the early 1980s. The story is a metaphor for disaffected youth everywhere, and the evils of racism disguised as patriotism.Solid performances all round. Stephen Graham is great as the skinhead leader.

16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It is... it really is,8,28 February 2010,"OK, so I wasn't in England in the early 80's... mostly because I hadn't been born yet... but from what I understand, this really is an accurate depiction of the period, and Meadows' own experiences, with the Iron Lady, drugs and friendship. This is rather engaging, and the pace is spot-on. The plot is compelling, and it never loses your interest. This has really thoroughly developed, interesting and credible characters, with no one being just ""good"" or ""bad"". Also, it evidently sucks being a kid no matter where you grow up. The editing and cinematography are impeccable, with intense use of hand-held, putting you right there in the situation at the exact right times. This is immensely realistic. The way this shows how an ideology, however flawed, can appeal to those who don't know better if someone with the right rhetoric presents it in a positive light is terrifying and convincing. I'm thrilled with how this presents an alternative/punk type as being, you know, a *human being*, not a freak. In general, everyone in this is. The dialog is great, and very natural. I freely admit that with the lingo, slang and accents, I did need my trusty subtitles. There is a lot of strong language including racial slurs, a bit of sexuality/nudity, and some violence(and it is a tense film from start to finish) in this. The DVD contains a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of dramas that are mature and tough enough to handle it. 8/10",This Is England
17,george.schmidt,Excellent coming-of-age story w/a twist; Meadows is a filmmaker to watch,9,5 November 2007,"British filmmaker Shane Meadows  who made quite an impression on me with his 2004 venture ""Dead Man's Shoes""  continues to be a worthy contemporary UK wunderkind the likes of his fellow country men like Neil Jordan, Stephen Frears and Mike Leigh  depicting the lower and lower middle-class of his homeland with such keen insight, observation and expert treatise on the socioeconomic hardships that endure having the breakdown of his characters with the weight of the world on their shoulders.This time on the slender back of 12 year old Shaun (extraordinary newcomer Thomas Turgoose), a ginger-haired, fair-skinned lad who has his crosses to bear  his sad home life (his beloved soldier father has been killed in the occurring Falkland Islands skirmish forcing Shaun and his mother Cynth {Jo Hartley}  to move to the north coastal hamlet of Grimsby {where much of the film was shot on location} ) forcing him to wear hand-me-downs and the scorn of his classmates that he winds up being 'adopted' by a gang of teenaged skinheads who treat him as a mascot, and eventually as an equal, even having the boy getting his head shaved and the 'uniform' of red braced suspenders, Doc Martens and button down conservative shirts.At first his mum is simply upset with his locks being shorn  oblivious to the real threat under her nose  but her tune changes when she thanks Woody (the affable Joe Gilgun), the defacto leader of the bunch. And then things truly take a turn for the worse when their real 'leader' Combo (Stephen Graham, in an excellent tour-de-force role), the more volatile, loose cannon type who has just been sprung from a short prison stint, making his way back into his fold with a force like a hurricane.What transpires is basically a coming of age story with echoes of ""Romper Stomper"", ""American History X"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Trainspotting"" and most near kin to Jordan's ""The Butcher Boy""  in the shattering of innocence by violence, fear and ultimately betrayal of one's comrades-in-arms. Meadows shoots in a documentarian, static style but it is never boring and his sharp eye for metaphorical and political commentary (from the beginning's archival clips of the era to a graffiti scrawled ""Maggie's A Tw*t"" on a broken down building in the urban blight of their township) is like a brace of ice water. While much of the film has a feeling of dread (especially when Combo is introduced), there is a care-free, even likable air to the group of young friends that border on the tender (the ritual-like haircutting sequence) to the absurdly comic (the cherubic, short Shaun wooing ages older ""Smell""  a nickname for Michelle  (Rosamund Hanson)  a lanky, punk giantess in comparison with a colorful shock of hair and make-up too boot) yet there is a very truthful air to the film and respects its characters throughout; a rare thing these days.Meadows is a filmmaker to keep tabs with and continues to surprise and more importantly entertain while educate.",This Is England
18,Buddy-51,an unforgettable look at violent youth,9,17 May 2009,"Superbly written and directed by Shane Meadows, ""This is England"" provides us with an unflinchingly realistic and grimly depressing look at the skinhead subculture of early 1980's Britain.Shaun is a twelve-year-old lad who has recently lost his father in the Falklands War. Even though Shaun has learned to give as good as he gets when the schoolyard and neighborhood bullies go to whaling on him (both verbally and physically), that still doesn't keep him from being ridiculed and harassed on an almost daily basis by kids who are bigger than he is - until, that is, he hooks up with a gang of social delinquents who take him under their wing, drastically altering his appearance and bringing him along on orgies of destruction as part of his initiation.Although ""This is England"" is harrowing in what it says about a generation caught in an out-of-control spiral of purposelessness, rebelliousness and violence, there is a surprising amount of humor and tenderness in the film as well. Shaun may be mouthy and obnoxious a good part of the time, but he also possesses a whip-smart sense of humor, a strong instinct for self-preservation, and a wise-beyond-his-years perceptiveness about how life on the street actually works. In a similar way, even the punks who befriend and corrupt the boy are portrayed as complex, three-dimensional individuals, their occasional displays of charm and decency going a long way towards explaining just why it is that Shaun and even his own well-meaning mother are so easily taken in by them.The real trouble begins when Combo, a neighborhood troublemaker and now radical ""England for the English"" nationalist, is released from prison and proceeds to infect the group with the idea of ""taking back"" the country from the hordes of dark-skinned ""Pakis"" who have increasingly made their home there. A gifted rabble rouser, Combo not only exploits working class dissatisfaction with the economy and the war, but appeals to out-and-out racism and xenophobia to win the men over to his side. This proves too much for a number of the gang's members - including Woody, the nominal leader - who quietly bow out of the scene, but Shaun, still feeling sorely the absence of his father, continues to find a home with the group.The thing that is most striking about ""This is England"" is how remarkably fleshed-out and true-to-life the characters are, a result stemming as much from Meadows' thoughtful and intelligent screenplay as from the brilliant performances by Thomas Turgoose and Stephen Graham as Shaun and Combo, respectively. Turgoose has an astonishing ability to be both childlike and strangely adult at one and the same time, while Graham keeps us on edge throughout with his volatile combination of charm, charisma, love of violence and hair-triggered temper. And there are numerous other first-rate performances in the film as well.Even though the story, in this case, is played out against the backdrop of bellicose speeches by Margaret Thatcher and file footage of the Falklands War, the themes the movie deals with - the irrational fear of ""the other,"" the radicalization of disaffected youth, the seductive nature of the mob mentality - are sadly universal and relevant to all times and societies. It is an eye-opening, cautionary tale about where modern society may be heading if we don't learn to see beneath the superficial differences of skin and culture and find the common ground of humanity that unites us all. It's an old message but one that is delivered with unforgettable force in this film.",This Is England
19,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Not always easy viewing but still very absorbing portrayal of a powerful time and place in England,10,1 May 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 12 year old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) lives in Yorkshire with his mum in the July of 1983. His dad was killed in the Falklands and he's having problems with bullying at school. Without a stable father figure to guide him, he drifts into the crowd of a gang of older skinheads, lead by Woody (Josepth Gilgun) and their beliefs. For a while, they amble their aimless lives away together, getting into mischief and with Shaun ending up growing up a little too fast. But things take a more drastic turn with the return of Combo (Stephen Graham), who's just been released from prison after serving time on Woody's behalf. He wants to take the gang in a more militant direction, making a stand against the rise of Pakistani immigrants into the country and getting the gang involved in activities for the far right National Front party. With young Shaun's mind being dangerously corrupted by Combo and his men, it's only a matter of time before things build up to end in disaster.Released a week before the elections, Shane Meadows' new film is in danger of being seen inadvertently (I'm sure) as a piece of BNP propaganda, with it's under-current of how racism and the motivation behind it has built up over the last twenty or so years in Britain. It's only had a limited release so far, but it's been getting wide acclaim, especially for the lead performance of the young Turgoose (even being tipped as the next Jamie Bell.) I say dangerous because, as I said, the film is stabbing at how the threads of racism towards so-called 'minority groups' have been sown over the last twenty or so years in Britain. I'm not racist and couldn't imagine a country with no black or Asian people (some of whom who I've met have been very nice.) But if I'm honest, there are times when I look around and worry, like Combo (and indeed the BNP) that there may be a bit too much immigration and that we're in danger of losing our cultural identity and I don't want that to happen either. This is England is quite a dangerous film because, in as sincere a way as it can, it dares to say...that racists do have a point. You don't have to agree with it and certainly the characters in this film are a bit too militant with the way they go about expressing their views, but (like anywhere, in fairness) there are a lot of territorial englishmen who are tired of their culture being invaded and won't stand for it. The BNP want a total end to immigration, so I won't be voting for them next election. I think the tories have a better idea with 'controlled' immigration, so they might be a better idea.Otherwise, there are a lot of other strong points to the film. In the lead role, young Turgoose does give the impression of being a young star on the rise, and I can't complain about any of the supporting cast either. Meadows has impressively captured the style and soundtrack of the era, including a neat opening scene, a montage of key events in the 80s played out to a catchy reggae tune that I don't know the name of.Well worth seeing. *****",This Is England
20,paul2001sw-1,This is poetry,9,9 June 2008,"With his gift for sly naturalistic dialogue, skillful use of music and ability to frame poignant beauty into shots of the everyday, Shane Meadows is arguably the finest film-maker working in England today; and 'This is England' is among his best works, its understated account of ordinary youths just hanging out in the recession of the 1980s perfectly judged. Out of this, a plot develops, based on the growing involvement of the gang in skinhead politics. This transition does feel slightly manufactured, as the story places its characters in a slightly artificial state of innocence and thus depicts racism as something external that descends upon them, rather than as something more innately part of the fabric of their lives. But Meadows shows his customary strength in his depiction of (in some senses) unsavoury human beings with sympathy where appropriate, and where not, still with humanity: at their least edifying, his characters are still 100% human. The acting, meanwhile, from an inexperienced cast, is consistently great. ""Low budget"" can mean quick and perfunctory; but Meadows makes visual poetry. It's a tragedy that this in itself is apparently sufficient to preclude his wider success.",This Is England
21,tomgillespie2002,Powerful portrayal of innocence manipulated,8,9 July 2014,"Shane Meadows' This is England, like the title suggests, is a bare- knuckled, fearlessly honest depiction of England. This isn't any old England, but Thatcher's angry, graffiti-ridden, skinheaded England, a time of needless war, poverty, and, key to the film, racial intolerance. Meadows' loosely autobiographical film lays it's anger out for all to see from the off, as the camera lingers on a council-estate wall scrawled with 'Maggie is a t**t'. But there's humour here also, and heart.We witness the majority of the film through the eyes of Shaun Fields (Thomas Turgoose - his character's name a thinly-disguised spin on that of the director's), a ragged, bullied loner, who lives alone with his mother after his father is killed in the Falklands. Walking home one evening from school, he is pitied by Woody (Joseph Gilgun), a Dr. Martens-wearing skinhead who, along with his friends, enjoys some harmless vandalism taken out on derelict properties. Woody takes him under his wing, even buying him a Ben Sherman and braces, and shaving his head. His mum doesn't approve, but at least he's being looked after. All is rosy until Woody's old friend Combo (Stephen Graham) is released from prison.His time in prison taught Combo that England is no longer what it once was, and is now overrun by immigrants taking away jobs from honest folk like himself and his bare-chested, meat-head friend Banjo (George Newton). He draws a line for Woody's gang - those who want to join him on his crusade to help restore England to it's glory days, and those who don't. Woody quickly points out that Combo is out of line, especially in the presence of his Jamaican friend Milky (Andrew Shim). But when Woody leaves, Shaun stays, and is sucked in by Combo's charisma, attending right-wing rallies in countryside pubs and smashing up the local shop owned by a Pakistani man.Like Elem Klimov's Come and See (1985), the child protagonist does the remarkable thing of ageing throughout. Not a physical transformation like Florya, but in presence. He evolves effortlessly from a boy whining at his mum in a shoe shop for not buying him a pair of Dr. Martens, to a foul-mouthed, brainless thug gobbling up everything that is fed to him by those around him. Meadows makes it clear that there are two types of skin-heads - those who embrace the style and image influenced by black music such as ska, and those bigoted, entitled types, channelling anger simply because it's there. Combo is obviously the second kind, but he has own dimensions too.Stephen Graham's performance is spectacular and genuinely terrifying. Anyone who has grown up in England will know the type; the type thankfully I've only ever come across when they get on a train and quickly draw attention to themselves. His words fly like scouse venom, his every line punctured by a swear word. But his protection of Shaun and his occasional child-like vulnerability means that there's sympathy to be given somewhere. Like all great child performances, Turgoose remains a child throughout, avoiding precociousness even in his most emotional scenes. And it's 12 year-old Shaun that remains the film's anchor, our wide-eyed window into innocence manipulated.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",This Is England

The plot of the movie was very interesting and it left me speechless in some moments because I could not predict what will happen next, something that made the movie even more interesting.

23,eddie_baggins,A British classic,10,12 October 2017,"A film of raw, unrelenting and passionate power, This is England remains underrated director Shane Meadows greatest singular achievement and one of Britain's all-time great feature length films.Spawning a collection of worthy mini-series follow ups in the years that followed its critically praised initial release, This is England not only deals with a politically charged time in the United Kingdom's Maggie Thatcher lead period of the 80's but examines the deep undercurrent of racism often present in otherwise civilised western countries all the while being a touching coming of age story of Thomas Turgoose's 12 year old Shaun.Meadows, who has also displayed a power as a filmmaker to make uncompromising films of almost documentary style realism, evidenced in other standout efforts like A Room for Romeo Brass and Dead Man's Shoes, directs This is England with both an unflinching eye and a compassionate hand as his believable and lovable characters experience life changing events all the while surrounded by a country that has reached a boiling point of tension and rage.Led by Turgoose's incredible well-constructed debut turn as the vulnerable Shaun who finds himself a part of a ragtag group of skinheads and rascals, This is England's cast that includes such recognisable faces as Joseph Gilgun as the lovable larrikin Woody, Vicky McClure as the deep thinking Lol, Andrew Shim as the Jamaican/British Milky and a young Jack O'Connell as feisty teenager Pukey, is one of the Britain's best ever assembled casts, the case of the perfect performers coming together as a whole that proved it was no lighting in a bottle occurrence when the large portion of the cast returned again for Meadow's award winning TV follow-ups.As good as both Meadows and his cast are in This is England, this film is owned completely by one of the modern eras most commanding and attention grabbing performances by Stephan Graham as the racist, tormented and charismatic Combo.A performer who has proved time and time again that his one of the best working in the business, yet a performer who has yet to receive his just rewards, Graham's Combo is a creation that's hard to describe, a fully inhabited incarnation that can only be achieved by actors at the very top of their game.When Combo makes his entrance into This is England's characters somewhat carefree lives at the 30 minute mark of the film, Meadows film marks its change in direction and tone and enters into an hour or so of cinematic brilliance as we're driven along by Graham's tour de force turn and a story that may seem on the surface to be simplistic, but ends up flooring us with a knockout punch that will linger days after initial viewing.Encapsulating the time and place of this period incredibly well, a landscape full of checkered shirts, suspenders, shaved heads, Doc Martins and a killer soundtrack, Meadows team-up with his performers, that is steered on its powerful course by Graham, create the world that makes This is England such a special and in many ways important film experience.Final Say – Far from an easy watch, This is England may not be everyone's cup of tea but Shane Meadow's gut-punch of a film remains to this day one of the most deceptively powerful and memorably casted films of the 21st century that includes an outstanding debut performance from Thomas Turgoose and a career best turn from Stephen Graham.5 Ben Sherman shirts out of 5",This Is England
24,johnnyboyz,"Brilliant, gritty and often eerie look at a decade summed up by a mentality most would shy away from.",8,14 June 2008,"I'm somewhat frustrated. I was going to use the line 'Forget Sparta, This is England!' for my one-line summary but after a brief double check it seems someone already beat me to it. But that's the only slice of negativity to come out of this comment for Shane Meadows' This is England: a raw, realistic and rather powerful look at the life and mentality of a gang consisting mainly of skinheads in 1980s Britain. I say 'mainly' because what struck me about this group is its attention to hierarchy. This film is so well written that the gang itself is fleshed out and developed just as well as that of the young boy Shaun (Turgoose) is. Such attention to detail and such process to break down all the elements you'll have on screen is fantastic and makes for great viewing.The initial incident of Shaun meeting the gang occurs under a bridge and you get the feeling these 'skins' are tough, dangerous and somewhat unkind. But the film develops and while we can't help but have that automatic reaction of fear and weariness to the group initially, you can feel it dissipate as Shaun gets closer to them and befriends them. Suddenly, they don't seem like thugs or racists but as a group of kids who merely hang around during a long, hot boring July summer. Just when we have come to associate these people as kids, the heavy artillery arrives in the form of a very disorientating scene in which a bare-chested, bald, tattooed male knocks on a door before charging in screaming wielding a sword  the shift in power has happened and we are given permission to feel un-easy again. It seems the male character charging in was a sick joke and the higher-ups of this outfit make themselves known. The incident that sparks this off is Combo's (surely Stephen Graham's career performance) release from prison after serving time for one of the initial boys.And from here, This is England after a light hearted set up that I sort of twigged begins its tale of realism, regret, self-discovery and of feint tragedy. I read the film is semi-autobiographical and looking at Meadow's IMDb mugshot, it's not hard to believe. Notice how the character's name 'Shaun' sounds a lot like director's name 'Shane'. The film targets racism as a subject but clouds its ideas somewhat but this is where I feel it is deliberate. The film is all about identity and knowing who oneself actually is. The politician played by one of my favourite English actors around (Frank Harper) states that ""we are not racists"" and yet you can catch a glimpse of a Nazi badge above one of the England flag's in one character's bedroom; purposely placed there I feel to challenge if the audience will buy into the idea these people are not fascists or if they will believe what they are presented with. Then there is the 'first' gang of 'skinheads' and how the ethnicity is spread around. Most of them are white, true but one male is half Jamaican and his roots are challenged later on by Combo; one character is overweight and one female named 'Smell' (Hanson) dressed in Gothic attire.This is where the emphasis on Fascism and identity becomes apparent and why I think Meadow's is so smart in presenting us with this initial group. These kids know nothing of politics and the Fascist ideation is one that is very much concentrated on everyone being the same. When Combo and the heavyweights arrive on the thirty minute mark, they are all white; they are all well built and they are all of the same ilk. It is no surprise Combo adopts the father figure role for Shaun since he's not overweight; he doesn't dress in Gothic attire; he certainly isn't black and he isn't embarrassed like Woody (Gilgun) should be as he has nothing to owe Combo in return for any prison time. Carrying on with the themes of identity and misbelieving, Combo gives us a monologue about identity and issues he feels are important. He states he hates bullies but remains one himself, even to his own white 'kind' which follows on from politician Lenny's idea that they're not racists despite the Nazi badge pasted above an England flag in a bedroom.Who This is England won't offend, it will educate in its own twisted little way. The opening is very anti-Thatcher and there are several shots of seemingly random graffiti stating a dislike for Thatcher. Perhaps a joint parting shot from Channel Four (who helped fund the film) that was set up when Thatcher gave everything we had away to the Americans? Could be. Then there is Combo's speech on the immigration and mixed ethnicity in Britain which seems un-needed on a narrative level but seems required on a character development level and yet helps point out that it's still going on today what with the Eastern European influx.This is England is the sort of film that will shamelessly jump from a scene displaying a high degree of racism when, in a corner shop, an Indian clerk is told he ""stinks of curry"" to a scene in which everyone is happy again and enjoying a birthday party with cake and what-not. The juxtaposition works well as do earlier altercations between the Indian clerk and Shaun himself. While non-Brits may not understand the politics behind the film especially to do with Thatcher, they might get a kick out of the realistic air the film carries in the same vein I enjoyed La Haine. For the rest of us, the film remains a powerful and important look at how times were and what might happen if certain political elements arise again.",This Is England
25,howard.schumann,Gritty realism punctuated with humor,9,17 September 2007,"The successful conclusion of the Falklands War in 1983 gave a boost to British patriotic feeling and helped re-elect the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was however, in the words of British director Shane Meadows ""an incredibly suspicious war, in the same way America and the UK got involved in Iraq"". During a time when 3.5 million were unemployed, Meadows bemoans the fact that British paratroopers were involved in killing 16-year old Argentine boys, fighting for a useless piece of land. Though victorious, the war in the Falklands unleashed underlying feelings of alienation and racism among some elements of British working class youth and gave rise to the Skinheads, a group that ultimately became involved in the public mind with the neo-Nazis.Loosely based on Meadows' teenage experiences, This is England dramatizes the unrest in Britain from the perspective of 12-year old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose), a diminutive working class youngster who lives with his mum after his father was killed in the war. Preceded by a montage of news and cultural events from the early 1980s, the film depicts Shaun's decline from joyous camaraderie with new found friends to support of an intolerant and emotionally disturbed role model. As the film opens, Shaun is a schoolboy with a cherubic look that conveys a sweet innocence. Just under the surface, however, there is a feistiness and volatility that provides pointers to where he is headed. Friendless and bullied, Shaun seeks a sense of belonging and soon becomes part of a gang of mischief makers and lay-a-bouts who give him the respect and dignity he is looking for. Led by Woody (Joseph Gilgun) and Milky (Andrew Shim), the group is proud of their working class status and dress accordingly with work-boots, jeans, and white shirts. Shaun allows one of the girls Lol (Vicky McClure) to shave his head and experiences his first kiss with Smell (Rosamund Hanson). Though his mother (Jo Hartley) is horrified when she sees how he looks, she is content to leave the boy in the care of his new friends. The most virulent racism in the film comes from Woody's friend Combo (Stephen Graham) who has just been released from prison and who splits the group into political and non-political factions. Joining the neo-fascist National Front, Combo and those that go with him unleash rhetoric of ferocious nationalism and set out on a campaign to intimidate immigrants and people of color. Meadows brilliantly shows how damaged lives and mutual needs can bring people together to take out their frustrations against those below them on the socio-economic scale.Torn between his friendship for Woody and his desire to redeem his father's memory, Shaun decides to join Combo's group, seemingly unaware that he is a powder keg ready to explode. Soon Shaun is spouting the racist clichés of his mentor as well as joining with him in assaults against Pakistani youngsters and local shopkeepers. Triggered by a discussion with Milky (Eric Shim), a Jamaican, about his own past, Combo's confrontation with the gentle black man is the dramatic high point of the film and the most difficult to watch. For Shaun it is a moment of realization and despair that signals the end of his childhood. For the viewer, it is a moment of searing pain and unbearable emotion. Winner of the award for Best Independent British film, This is England follows the tradition of directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh by combining gritty realism with humor, punctuated by tension and outbursts of brutal violence. The performances are outstanding, especially those of Turgoose and Graham, who create fully three-dimensional characters that come alive as people we can identify with and relate to, while still deploring their actions. Using a soundtrack of ska (Caribbean rhythm and blues) melodies and the songs of Toots and the Maytals, This is England is a timely film that not only captures the mood of the 80s in the British Midlands with authenticity and rare honesty but has important parallels to events of the present day.",This Is England
26,Chris Knipp,Bonding on the brink of tenderness and rage,8,14 August 2007,"THIS IS ENGLAND: hatred, repressed fury, violence, and racism. It's 1983 in a stark North of England town near the coast, and Shaun (Thomas Turgoose, astonishingly intense and real) is a little stocky pre-teen boy living with his mother Cynthia (Jo Hartley, with big hair and big glasses). His father has recently died, unlucky enough to be one of the 258 British soldiers to lose their lives in Mrs. Thatcher's Falklands adventure. The ""Iron Lady's"" stock is high, but not in Shaun's poor neighborhood, where the façade of a shabby Church of Christ is emblazoned with the words ""Maggie is a tw-t"" (and that's with an A, not an I). Shaun's clock radio wakes him up with Maggie's voice in the opening scene: he quickly turns it off.Shaun doesn't fit in at school and gets ragged for having a dead dad, and for wearing a pair of bell-bottoms. He attacks a bigger boy, who gets beaten by the school authorities. As he heads home through an underpass, a motley crew of skinheads are waiting for one of their number to bring them some beer. They see he's had a bad day and, overcoming his resistance, a particularly nice one, Woody (Joseph Gilgun), insists that he sit down and join them.And join them he does, soon acquiring Doc Martens substitutes in size four, tight jeans, a natty checked shirt, and a skinned head, and joining the others in a café or sharing drinks and smokes with them and their colorfully dressed girlfriends in tiny flats. The film is attentive to its period in dress, music, and visuals, which are in-your-face without seeming self-conscious. Dialogue is disarmingly direct and natural. Summer vacation rolls around, and Shaun finds fellowship and welcome beyond his wildest dreams. When a very large boy (Gadget, Andrew Ellis) bullies him, Woody intercedes; but Shaun's more than ready to go on the attack himself despite being half everyone else's size. The group is a mixture, with one black Jamaican, Milky (Andrew Shim), and males of various ages. Early on they dress up wildly and go smashing up vacant council flats. Director Meadows, who says Shaun's experience partly echoes his own, seems eager to make this little working class gang original and free of racism. Problems are ironed out through frank encounters, and there are lots of hugs.That's till the appearance of Combo (Stephen Graham), an older skinhead just released from a three-year jail term. It's immediately obvious Combo is uncomfortable with the presence of Milky, and he soon banishes or drives off the nicer, more thoughtful gang members, and Milky. But not Shaun, who even attacks Combo over a crucial issue to him, thereby gaining his undying respect and becoming his temporary mascot. Shaun even takes a grown up girl, Smell (Rosamund Hanson), as his girlfriend and the film typically skirts a line between the shocking and the sweet in showing their relationship.Combo leads the men to a recruitment meeting of the racist National Front party and on to planned attacks on ""Pakis."" This rather quickly leads to disaster and tragedy. Combo is a brute, but in Meadow's vivid script and Graham's rich performance he is a complex character. At one point later he temporarily befriends Milky, and remembers that skinhead music came from Ska, and hence from black culture. The sadness of his life is illustrated when he's rejected by Lol (Vicky McClure), whom he raped when she was underage and fantasized about in prison. He hasn't a clue, but his emotional pain is real. At times he seems just as likely to burst into tears as to roar and brandish a machete. Much of the power of the film lies here: that you don't know where a scene is going to go. Violence is just around the corner, and sometimes right in the foreground, but tenderness is there. Some of the people are rotten, weak, immature, or cowardly. What makes this a good picture of adolescence is that it's so full of wounded feelings. And when you think back on it hardly anyone is more grown up than little Shaun. But for all his strength, he joins in the Paki attacks with an unnerving glee.""This is England"" is a queer blend of nostalgia, laughter, and shock. At moments it's painful to watch and at others disarmingly sweet. It never loses its freshness and vigor. Shaun is almost too feisty to be believed. But it doesn't seem to matter that the characters are overdrawn, because they're not one-dimensional. As someone has commented, Shaun actually grows younger as the action progresses. At the end his season in hell is over and he may be ready to be a boy again. But losing his father and living in poverty are things that keep his life from ever being calm or bland. This is a strong film. But whether its humanizing of skinheads is valid or its alternation of violence and sweetness is enlightening is hard to say. The period flavor is good, but there are various errors, staring with the fact that it's 1983, and the Falklands War is still going on (it ended in 1982). One thing is sure: that Meadows' film-making belongs to an English tradition that goes back to the Sixties neo-realism of the British New Wave, which he vigorously renews. In ""TwentyFourSeven,"" ""A Room for Romeo Brass,"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the Midlands,"" among others, Meadows has adhered consistently to the subject of youths under bad older influences in impoverished Northern England milieus. It's good stuff, and it seems to be getting better. The casting is faultless. Word is that Thomas Turgoose was turned down for a bit part in a school play due to rowdiness. Well, his rowdiness is well used here. Down with school!",This Is England
27,Polaris_DiB,This is Combo,7,23 October 2007,"American History X was a highly regarded and influential film about the nature of modern racism in America, but like many movies of its type it was flawed by a epiphany ending and a one-direction approach to a disturbing and mixed-message form of human nature. This is England is roughly a British form of the same fascination, though slightly better and definitely more interesting with the lack of on-screen prison dynamic.Shaun is an eleven year old in Thatcher-era England; his father died in the recent war, the children make fun of him, and he lives in the world of 80s styles and subcultures, which can be damaging to anyone (hell, the get-ups of the people in some of the earlier scenes are damaging to the eyes, but that's the point). From the get-go Shane Meadows shows an England that is not something for nationalistic pride--graffiti litters almost every outside surface, kids are completely out of control, adults are the standard misunderstanders and symbols of institution, and Shaun of course is having a very bad day. This day turns around, however, when he's invited into a group of skinheads by the friendly leader who professes to ""hate bullies"" and promises to show Shaun a good time. For a while fun and games ensue, Shaun's connection with older kids opens up a range of experiences for him, and then an older skinhead named Combo appears and everything starts falling apart from there. Combo is angry, he's racist, and of course he's very charismatic and automatically takes to bringing Shaun along with him to his endeavors.It's at this point that it seems the film is going to go off on a tired old direction every other movie of this type tends to take, but there's a little bit more depth here. Combo might be a Bad Guy, in a sense, but once he appears the movie becomes his story and we end up seeing a whole lot more than we're usually given for racists. No direct policy or answer is given to why Combo has so much hatred and fear, but evidence exists of it in many different directions, one of the primary ones being, of course, his loneliness and alienation. We see this through Shaun's eyes because Shaun is too young to understand the whole dramatic impact of the situation--he, like so many other eleven year olds, just thinks the older guy's there to beat up the bullies for him. Thus comes Shaun's integration into the racist policies of the skinhead subculture.For the most part the movie is genuinely good at presenting three dimensional characters who pull along the narrative to sometimes hilarious and sometimes disturbing areas. One major gripe is that sometimes the camera focuses so close on Combo's face that his eyebrows and lips start falling out of the frame, which becomes very distracting and doesn't serve the purpose of allowing us to truly regard the actor's portrayal of what is going on in this man's mind. Those shots are numerous and at times contrast sharply with the montage, sound editing, and other devices Meadows uses to present an image of England--the movie is called ""This is England"" after all, but when Combo starts dominating like he does so often, it might as well be called ""This is Combo,"" because the background almost disappears.--PolarisDiB",This Is England
28,GiraffeDoor,You won't forget it,8,18 September 2019,A very special movie. As an Englishman born in the '90s I have a particular fascination with its identity as a snapshot of a very particular place and time but it's also a vivid depiction of the social alienation that can occur so easily to anyone and the consequences it leads to.Its ethnic nationalist characters are treated with nuance rather than being crude caricatures and it is both frightening and moving to see them desperately snatch at the only power they have in Thatcher's Britain and reveal their inner vulnerability.The whole thing feels sordidly real and yet still manages to be lyrical.

29,barnabyrudge,Hard-hitting exploration of gang culture and racial hatred.,8,8 August 2010,"Director Shane Meadows brings a skillful blend of humour and shock to this character study set in the north of England in the early 1980s. His examination of the harsh childhood experiences of 11 year old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is at times laugh out loud funny, while at other points its tone is so bleak and devastating that it is genuinely hard to watch. Meadows generates some real power with This Is England – his picture of a grim urban wasteland, where hope and aspiration are strangled comes across as all-too-real.Young Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) lives with his mum in a tough council estate in the north of England. He is constantly teased and bullied about the way his mum dresses him, but worse is the way the more malicious kids bait him about the recent death of his father in the Falklands War. Unable to truly communicate with his mum, it is no exaggeration to say that Shaun is an angry and unstable young individual. Eventually Shaun falls in with a gang of older kids, led by a dim teenager named Woody (Joe Gilgun). The gang welcome Shaun into their ranks – pretty soon he is indulging in the usual gang shenanigans: drinking, vandalism, hanging out in dirty cafes and so on. Things become far more serious with the arrival of Combo (Stephen Graham), a former gang member who has recently been released from jail. Combo's time inside has transformed him into a thoroughly dangerous, violent, racist thug. His behaviour is so extreme that he alienates most of his old gang mates, but young Shaun is at such an impressionable stage in his life that he is seduced by Combo's hard line approach. Before long Shaun is in a much darker circle, his life spiralling out of control in a cycle of racist hysteria and wanton thuggery.This Is England is a very accomplished film. Its semi-documentary style adds a further sense of realism, and the performances of Turgoose and Graham are outstanding. Graham's portrayal of the racist is especially terrifying (he is the most convincing British thug since Robert Carlyle gave us Begbie in Trainspotting). Some of the supporting characters are played somewhat amateurishly, but fortunately they aren't allowed enough screen time to ruin the film as a whole. While it is a deliberately unlovely and hard-hitting film, it rationalises its extremes with earthly humour and ironic nostalgia.

ALL stereotypes. At least the East End Kids movies had real laughs,the laughter here was forced.Ratings ** (out of 4) points 56 (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)",This Is England
33,bandw,Two countries divided by a common language,7,22 November 2010,"Within a few minutes of watching this I realized that I was going to have to turn on English subtitles on the DVD. But to my great disappointment there were no such. I can't believe that I am the only U.S. viewer who got only about 60% of the dialog. And for some of the characters, like the young lad's woman friend, I got about 20%--a word or phrase here and there.I think I got enough to follow the story of a twelve year old who falls in with some not unlikable skinheads, then when a guy returns to the scene from having been in prison, his racist, violent agenda splits the group. From that point the viewing becomes highly unpleasant, even if realistic. I did not get the idea of using the Falklands war as a backdrop. It seemed to have nothing to do with the main theme of the movie, which was to show the transformation of a loose alliance of disaffected, but basically harmless, youths into a violent supremacist group having national impact. The significance the flag with Saint George's Cross, which plays a meaningful role (particularly in the final scene) is a bit murky in my mind. I am assuming that its use has some hyper-nationalism symbolism.My comments here are primarily to alert non-English audiences (i.e. those who have never lived in England) that an appreciation of this film will most likely present challenges. It does have relevance for U.S. audiences in an era of anti-immigration sentiment.",This Is England
34,stensson,Skins in Thatcherland,8,19 August 2007,"The skinhead culture fascinates many directors and it's understandable. It's one of the few remaining subcultures in the West, much because of the Nazi connections.But the skins in this movie aren't political and no racists to start with. One of the gang members is even black. They live in a happy community in the early 80s, having fun and being together in a totally grey unfriendly working class environment. It's very hopeful and the 12-year-old finds himself accepted for the first time in his life. His longing for the dead father of the Falklands war is somewhat replaced.But darkness arrives with the skin veteran who comes back from jail. And there are conflicts between the racist fraction and the others. But whatever this is, it's not black and white. The characters are much more complicated.Much has been said about young Thomas Turgoose as the 12-year-old. He's very good but the great portrait is by Stephen Graham as the old/new gang leader. Absolutely brilliant work.",This Is England
35,intelearts,466th Review: Surprisingly Complex and Superb 80s Recreation,8,4 December 2011,"Having run this eight times in 2 weeks as part of wider education program on race and values I can honestly say I've got to know it more than well. the choice was to fade out and let it wash over me, or to seize the opportunity and really see what's there. I was honestly surprised at how rich this became.What seems on the surface simply a film about a 12 yr old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose, best child actor I've seen this decade, makes the Potter films looks wooden by comparison) who finds an identity with skinheads, who in turn are split asunder when Combo (Stephen Graham, and you can see why he got Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire from this) enters and calls for a racist stand.A couple of interesting notes: firstly, Thomas Tugoose's mother (Who the film is dedicated to) died just as this was going into production - and you can see the film in the context, and secondly, skinheads, originally in 1969 had nothing to do with neo-nazism, it was a radical reactionist take against hippies - if hippies had flares, long hair, and no shoes, so skinheads had drainpipe trousers, no hair, and Doc Martens. Their choice of music was Ska, a particularly British blend of ragga and Jamaican Dancehall and Northern Soul. They were mixed racially. It was only in the 70s with football hooliganism and the rise of the sickening National Front (and their handouts really were some of the more disgusting political literature ever seen in a democracy) that skinheads were recruited and converted to nationalism, and hardcore racism. So by the time we arrive at the films setting in the early 1980s some skinheads are doing it to be different, and others because they were drawn to far-right politics. The film's conflict comes from the those clash of cultures.this is one a handful of films (The Kid in particular and Cass) that capture the real Eighties, which was for most people a pretty sad affair and not the usual big hair, stock market, colourful clothes that retropeddlars would have us believe.This is England seems to be about a subculture, but it's the acting that makes this superb. From Woody (Hugely empathetic Joseph Gilgum) to Cynth (Jo Hartley) to others this is great ensemble acting. But the real prizes belong to Turgoose and Graham.What you realise is that Combo isn't simply a racist (though he definitely is) but like Kes or The Loneliness of the Long Distant Runner, he's deeply messed up - the film gives you clues as you go along as to how messed up - and when the film reaches its climax you're missing the point if you only see it as being a one dimensional take on a racist and his hate.This is England is brave film-making by Shane Meadows, it's both very funny and deeply shocking, it's complex and simplistic, and it's great story-telling about a period and a subgenre that is definitely worth watching.",This Is England
36,ElijahCSkuggs,This Is England and This Is Awesome,9,8 September 2007,"Shane, Shane, Shane....you just keep doing it. My first experience with you was with Dead Man's Shoes, and that became one of my favorite movies. Then not too long later I saw A Room For Romeo Brass, which again, became a favorite of mine. And now I get to see This Is England, and just like the others, it instantly became a favorite of mine. And I'll tell ya why! First off, lemme just give ya a quick description of what you're probably gonna watch. A 12 year old lad named Shaun, played by a fantastic unknown little actor, is down in the dumps. He gets bullied, gets in fights, and most of all is in dire need of a male figure in his life. And then come in the skinheads. Now first off clear your minds of what you think you know about skinheads. They are not all racist, hardcore maniacs....back then for some it was a way to be different kind of like the Punk scene. Anyways, he meets a great group of friends and Shaun has finally found his niche. But then comes Combo, played great by Stephen Graham. You may know him as Tommy, Jason Statham's sidekick in Snatch. Well anyways, when he shows up fresh out of the cooler, he tries to pick things up just how he remembers them, and with fresh inquisitive meat around, his job isn't a very tough one. What follows is a tale of morality, judgement and growing up. It's touching, thought-provoking, meaningful, funny.....everything that you'd come to expect from a Meadows film.All actors shine in this film. And when you add in Shane's realistic as hell writing, the actors realism jumps ten fold. Obviously again Shane brings great music to the flick as well, the first song I heard I think was ""Come on Eileen""...haha, that's perfect stuff. Let me tell you straight, if you're a fan of Shane, then you should enjoy this flick to a very high level. And if you're a real big Shane Meadows fan you'll notice a few actors from his previous films. I keep on hearing ""The Best British Film of the year/in years"" blah blah blah. No kidding, but don't just settle for just little old Britain, this is a universally well-told and meaningful film that works on many levels. It's simply one of the best films of the year, and I hope it gets seen on a wider level. I come to think the same thing with every film he makes....oh well, at least me and my friends are seeing them. :)",This Is England
37,crossbow0106,Gritty and Harrowing,9,4 April 2008,"This film begins with a montage of the Thatcher years, so you know right off where you're heading. Thomas Turgoose plays 12 year old Shaun, a kid who gets picked on at school. He falls in with a group of older guys and thats when the movie really kicks in. Eventually, Shaun becomes a skinhead. Its no coincidence that Shaun has no father (his father died in the Falklands war). Its usually ""at risk"" kids like him who get involved in groups such as this. The movie has an excellent pace, and as it is the vision of the Director, Mr. Meadows, you just know its speeding towards a climax. During the film I was reminded of another excellent film with similar overtones set in Glasgow ""Small Faces"". This film is even more in your face. As you watch, you're riveted to what Shaun will do. The acting by everyone in this film is consistently terrific, because it doesn't seem like they're acting. It truly feels like a reality show gone off the tracks. If I have one complaint, and it is minor, its that I could not sometimes understand the dialogue, due to the thick accent (same thing with ""Small Faces""). However, thats my ear training problem, not yours. Edgy, ugly, stunning, not for the faint of heart. Highly recommended.",This Is England
38,Stampsfightclub,This is English cinema at its brutally honest best,9,18 December 2009,"Shaun (Turgoose) is being bullied at school and when Woody (Gilgun) and his gang invite him into their skinhead gang Shaun learns the difficult truth about Thatcher's England.Of all the brilliant British films to have been released over the last twenty years it is fair to say none have had provoked such a resonating truth to them as this Shane Meadows picture which is based on many of his personal experiences.This is England is set in the early 1980's a time of the Falkland's war that sets up the theme. Shaun is a bullied 11 year old and is living in depression following his dad's death in that war. After a particularly harsh outburst from a fellow pupil about his dad in a car you will feel instant disdain for the bully and sympathy for Shaun.Thomas Turgoose is quite a revelation in this picture. Starring here when he was just 14 he brings about the classic epitome of the British stereotype. The swearing, the smoking, the girls, the reckless actions and the desire to be wanted by others are all characteristics of today's modern youth and yet the incredible teenager battles this stereotype though a determined hard nut performance. The underlining sadness of his dad's death is the defining point of his character's true nature, epitomized during Combo's speech and given a fine respectful gesture in the final stages.Stephen Graham is the quarter stone of this picture. Combo is a shocking idealist, a man revelling in frustration at the way England has been overrun by immigrants, the way Margaret Thatcher has capitalized on the citizens of England and how decent Englishmen are homeless and jobless. And though this film is set in 1983 and we are now 26 years on, these issues are still valid. Our system to bring in anyone who asks keeps the unemployment rising and personally, I am open minded to the fact different cultures and people can teach us new things and add to our economy, there is no denying that there comes a point when England won't be England anymore, and the opinions and story of this picture make this a true realization of how this country has formed over the past decades.Aside from the political and National agendas on display we have concepts of friendship and family. The initiation of Shaun into the group is heart warming friendship and the character of Woody is a symbol of goodness.The too slow first half is somewhat forgotten as we dive into the emotional core of the script, exploring the racism and nationalisation and with a fine hard change of character mind this brings about the most shocking finale imaginable.An obvious comparison to this 2006 release would be American History X which showcased racism in American society and how Edward Norton's outlook changed during prison. But the change here is through a heart stopping act of losing control and has a crushing ending, this is England has it all.",This Is England
39,agmoldham,A great British film - or should that be English?,8,29 April 2007,"There is no doubt that this film is a truly great piece of film-making. Shane Meadows crafts films in the same style as Martin Scorcese. We are given a glimpse into the lifestyle of a group of characters over a short period of time. It is very much a fly on the wall type of movie. The point of these films is to understand the actions of the characters rather than judging their actions. I have no doubt that there will be some people that tag this film as being racist which is rather missing the point.The film follows Shaun a 12 year old being borough up in early 80's England. He has lost his father in the Falklands war and suffers bullying and isolation until he is befriended by a group of skinheads. The happy band are challenged when Combo is released from prison. Thomas Turgoose is magnificent in the lead role and the direction/screenplay are also spot on the mark. For anybody that lived through the period there are lots of reminders about the period. The film is based on Meadow's own childhood and is quite mesmerising at times.I was gripped throughout the film and it also gave me plenty to think about afterwards. What more can you ask for when going to the movies? I suppose if you go to the movies for escapism then go watch something else, but if you want a gripping thought provoking drama then it doesn't come much better than this.

40,tonypeacock-1,British cinema at its finest. 1980s style.,8,31 March 2021,"Impressive 2006 film from director Shane Meadows set in 1983 Thatcherite England.The film is shot in 16mm that gives it a documentary feel which goes hand in hand with the archive news footage of news events of the time most notably the Falklands War when British armed forces reclaimed the islands from Argentina's military junta with a naval task force.The primary character is 12 year old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose), in 1983 struggling to come to terms with the death of his father in the conflict.Shaun provides some comic relief with his colourful language in some scenes and romance with an older character, Smell!Shaun struggles in poverty brought up by his mother with poor fitting flares that provide some laughs.The shoe shop scene is such an example where Shaun is taken to buy some London 'special' not Doc Martin's.He befriends a harmless group of older youths on the edge of the punk scene, including Smell.I say harmless, they aren't far right, racist National Front members although such subjects are introduced when a character called Combo (Stephen Graham) is released from prison and returns to the group splitting friendships in the process.Combo is your stereotypical far right, thuggish, racist who is an active member of the National Front. He is also extremely violent and there are a couple of scenes where his violence comes out to brutal effect.Meadows is as good as acclaimed British directors like Allan Clarke and Kenneth Loach. I will definitely check out more of his filmography.This film launched spinoff television dramas in later years following the characters journeys later in the decade.Turgoose debut performance is excellent as are the parallels between the other cast which sometimes align and sometimes clash.",This Is England

They are nice non racists who don't believe in any of the skinhead ideaology. So my guess is these guys just think they are cool and dress up as skinheads...get this one of the skinheads is black....This movie is so stupid and unrealistic...The acting was OK but thats about it.

42,oneloveall,"Quite engaging, but not excellent",7,17 January 2008,"One of England's most critically successful exports in years arrived in this gritty, lo-fi period drama centering around one very young lad's introduction into his friendly neighborhood skinhead gang in the early 80's. Shane Meadows, coming off the cult success of his brutally simple revenge tale Dead Man's Shoes, attempts a more accessible view here despite his penchant for realism. Boasting an array of strong, authentic performances, Meadows is able to transform viewers back into the writer-director's early upbringing, into the ghettos of Britain with much believability. The filmmaker's personal experience really shows when viewing this excellently-casted group go about their daily routines of mischief and mayhem.This is England works best in small scenes of observational glory, but remains a tad underwhelming thematically for feeling a bit emotionally forced at times. I would have liked to have seen the movie extended a bit more to develop the characters a little better so the questionable climax would not hold as much doubt, but even with all of it's imperfections, This is England is a well made coming of age story told with plenty heart and personality, and marks the complete arrival of Meadows as one of Britain's most important young filmmakers.",This Is England
43,CountZero313,"this was someone's England, I suppose",7,1 March 2009,"If, like me, you were born in Britain in the Sixties, the first thing that hits you in This is England is a wave of nostalgia. Blockbusters on telly, Crombies, chopper bikes, mods, skinheads, new romantics, Culture Club, Maggie's not for turning, Goose Green, HMS Sheffield... Meadows' characters are credible, their idiosyncratic vernaculars (what IS Woody talking about half the time?) drawing the audience in. At first, they inhabit a simple tale: Twelve-year-old Shaun is bullied at school but discovers love, acceptance and new trials when he is taken in by a group of older kids.That particular storyline works fine, especially Shaun's sometimes enchanting but slightly revolting first love rites of passage with Smell.Then Combo arrives, played with an intense ferocity by Stephen Graham, who may have well been taking notes from Daniel Day-Lewis on the set of Gangs of New York. This is where Meadows the storyteller tries to work with Meadows the polemicist. The collaboration clicks most of the time. Milky's temporary acceptance is less dated than people might think. As Combo's mood turns and we see racism as the out for his anger rather than the cause, there is a smile from Milky that says it all. This is how it will always be, this is how we will inevitably relate to each other, as embodiments of groups. And the smile says - I do not agree. You are wrong. The smile tells you Milky has won the argument before the fight, and drains the fight of any bragging rights. That smile is a sublime piece of film-making.The rest of the politics gets a bit garbled. Maggie started the Falklands War to distract us from three-and-a-half million unemployed and immigrants taking over our country? The Thatcher legacy is contentious, convoluted, and still far too recent to provide any settled consensus on, and Meadows adds little of substance to the ongoing fight ('debate' is too polite a word for the heat any discussion of Thatcherism generates).I was absorbed by Shaun the boy, becoming a man through his interactions with those around him. I was less convinced by Shaun the product of Thatcher's Britain, howling 'Paki bastard!' at a shopkeeper one moment but finally reduced to throwing his St. George's Cross into the sea. That flag-toss, especially, was far too bombastic and an unworthy end to an engaging film.This may be Shaun Meadow's England, and as a Scot, I see familiar and strange elements (it took a while longer for the skinheads to establish a foothold north of the border). It will bring back memories for those of us who grew up under Maggie's yoke, some we would rather forget, but I do wonder what the babies of Blair and Brown make of this film.",This Is England
44,Superunknovvn,English History X,7,30 July 2007,"""This Is England"" is the English equivalent of ""American History X"" and ""La haine"". This doesn't mean it's a rip off, it's an original portrayal of the skinhead-scene in England as opposed to the U.S. and France and it's probably the most realistic of the three movies.Shane Maedows apparently based a lot of this story on his own childhood experiences. He had proved that he knows how to portray English small towns before in movies like ""Dead Man's Shoes"". Again the cinematography and the soundtrack are amazingly beautiful. The scenery, the clothes, everything in this movie looks like it was actually filmed in 1983 when the story takes place. I don't know many other recent movies that portray the 80's as authentically as this one.I cannot say much about how authentic this movie is when it comes to portraying the skinhead scene, but it definitely feels like it was very authentic. The characters are believable and played by an amazing cast. There is not one weak link here. 13 year old Thomas Turgoose, the leading kid, is up and away the best child actor I've ever seen. He's just amazing as Shaun, the little kid whose father died in the the war and who slips into the skinhead scene. Hopefully we'll hear more of this talented little brat.The one weak aspect of ""This Is England"" is a flaw that it shares with almost every skinhead movie I've seen so far. The story is pretty predictable in its proceeding and in the way it's trying to explain violence and prejudice in the end. Social problems, unemployment and dysfunctional families were (are) certainly the main reasons for xenophobia as depicted in the movie, but somehow ""This Is England"" gets to that too quickly. It's always some character having a breakdown, so we all know that he's really just a confused and miserable guy. Mind you, this is by no means a fairy tail version of English violence like ""Hooligans"", but it's still not quite the definite movie on the subject.",This Is England

47,Shattered_Wake,S_W's review of 'This Is England' (2006),8,20 February 2008,"'This Is England' (2006) One the last day of term 1983, we meet Shaun (Thomas Turgoose), the bullied son of a fallen soldier from the Falkland Wars. After a fight with a disrespectful punk at school, Shaun meets a group of skinheads led by Woody (Joe Gilgun). Things seem fine at first, like he's being taken in the group until he's bullied out by the fat kid, Gadget (Andrew Ellis). But, after awhile, Gadge is sent to retrieve Shaun and they transform and accept him into the group.It's smooth sailing until Wood's ex-con friend, Combo (Stephen Graham), takes control of the group. Combo, a crazed radical, who sees himself in young Shaun, attempts to turn the group into a nationalist revolution movement. And succeeds, minus a few members. Sadly, however, the group is hardly a political front. Instead, it mainly focuses on graffiti, theft, and cowardly attacks on other races.'This Is England' is an intense look at a reality sometimes forgotten by outsiders. It will stir deep in your soul well past the ending credits if you let it.8/10.",This Is England
48,Ali_John_Catterall,Too Much Too Young,8,12 November 2009,"At 12, and young-looking even for his age, Shaun Fields (Turgoose) looks hardly capable of breaking and entering a boiled egg. His loss of innocence is at the heart of Shane Meadows' most autobiographical work to date (notice how 'Shaun Fields' deliberately echoes 'Shane Meadows'), along with ever-relevant subjects like absent and surrogate fathers, Western imperialism and white working-class marginalisation, particularly in the post-industrial suburbs. Right on time, the film also addresses the flashpoint issue of the day; an incipient racism virtually legitimised under recent governments and in sections of the press, stoking anti-Muslim sentiment. This packs a lot into its 100 minutes, but never feels hectoring. ""I've been picked on three times today, all because of my trousers,"" Shaun tells poodle-permed mum Cynthia, whose soldier husband died a year earlier in the Falklands. Other schoolyard taunts cut deeper: ""How many people can you fit in the back of a Mini? Two in the front, two in the back - and your dad in the ashtray."" Salvation comes in the form of fair-minded skinhead Woody and his apparently parentless gang of puppyish, moon-faced boys and preternaturally aged girls, all pinched faces and feathercuts. Little older than Shaun himself, burdened with the same juvenile insecurities, they're nonetheless better dressed in their immaculate Ben Shermans and cherry red Docs. Shaun signs up, receives his regulation uniform and haircut. Not that mum approves. ""We've got problems,"" a wheedling Gadget tells her obsequiously. But at least he's found some friends. Life is now a fizzy sherbet rush of trashing empty houses on decrepit Nottingham estates and getting an education in skinhead music - an authentic mix of 2-Tone and rock-steady. Shaun also gets an education in girls via beanpole Smell. ""You might look about four,"" drawls Smell, ""but you kiss like a 40-year-old."" As usual, Meadows gets great, moving performances from his young cast. When the older, damaged Combo (Graham) shows up, newly vomited from prison, he drives a nail into the group, exemplified in his loaded question for Milky (Andrew Shim), their sole black skinhead. ""Do you consider yourself English or Jamaican?"" Combo spells out his call to arms: ""For 2,000 years this little island has been raped and pillaged by people who would want a piece of it. For what? Just so we could open the floodgates and say 'come in'? Now three-and-a-half million of us can't find jobs 'cos they're taking them all."" Margaret Thatcher is also deeply unpopular with Combo for having marginalised the far right by whipping the immigration issue, and the union flag, from under them. Then there's her war in the Falklands, shipping fine upstanding white men to a ""phoney war to kill a load of shepherds"". Having convinced Shaun his father died in vain, Combo drags his splinter cell to NF branch meetings led by Frank Harper's Lenny. They harass the Asian locals and struggle with racist graffiti - ""Hey, how many effs in 'Off?'"" - until a brutal incident makes Shaun think again. Working on a characteristically modest budget, Meadows and crew have fashioned a fantastically authentic drama: from the recreation of the era's dingy landscapes; its youth cults (exerting a pull on suburbanites long after their metropolitan counterparts were morphing into Tacchini-clad casuals); that exhilarating soundtrack (Toots And The Maytals, Specials, UK Subs); and the tangled political climate set against a backdrop of mass unemployment, working class disenfranchisement and a phoney war. This is England, indeed. Courageously, the film also rescues the skinheads from all-encompassing neo-Nazi associations. The movement's origins lay in a shared celebration by white working-class Britons and the Rude Boys of Jamaican music, a multiculturalism made more potent and pronounced during post-punk. Though leaving one in no doubt about the stupidity and crassness of the far right (Combo's race-hate merchants give Smell porn mags for birthday presents) it also digs deeper, trying to find out what makes them tick. Make no mistake, despite its low-key approach (certainly, less hysterical than Meadows' true masterpiece, Dead Man's Shoes) This Is England is a deeply political film, but here renders the political personal, particularly when depicting the far-reaching consequences of war on the families left behind. There is also a second drama being played out here, one that audiences may not pick up on. As Meadows has revealed, in the film's backstory Combo (like Stephen Graham, the actor who plays him) is mixed-race. His explosive reaction to Milky's description of a large, loving Jamaican family isn't just one of jealousy, but borne from more complex emotions concerning his parentage. However, not knowing this takes nothing away from the film's power. The use of The Smiths' 'Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want' at the finale not only captures the film's melancholy yearning, but, historically, heralds the new wave of white working class indie culture, in which Morrissey's brand of wistful introspection would succeed the skinhead's sulphate-fuelled moonstomping; at least for a while. Good times for a change. In April 2007, just prior to the film's release, the British Board Of Film Classification hobbled the film with an 18 certificate (though Bristol City, Camden and Westminster councils later successfully whittled it down to a 15), decreeing that the movie's use of ""vicious racial language... might give out the wrong message to an impressionable audience"". Such a move didn't just preclude Turgoose from seeing his own film, but further prevented Meadows from screening it to 15-year-old schoolchildren, to ""show the dangers of bullying, peer pressure and racism to young people"". While it was the filmmakers' misfortune to have released their film at a time when policy is dictated by public perception, it was hoped that this vital piece of cinema would eventually find a proper, receptive audience, making its win for 'Best British Film' at the 2008 BAFTAs a richly deserved and very satisfying victory.",This Is England
49,willcundallreview,A very good British Drama,8,27 March 2014,"Rating-8/10This Is England is a strong drama about skinheads and the affect it's members can have on youth and other such things. The drama is strong but the ride is worth it making you think long and hard and really ponder what can turn humanity to certain things and what some people were like in the near past and even today. I felt as many others did that the film was very good, I think some will absolutely love this film, it isn't enjoyable(that is the wrong word), it is a moving drama, and here's why I think it was a very good one of that.The story is a good pace and doesn't really drag at any points in truth, by the end you think about what you have seen and if you truly watched it then it should make you think about how crazy some people were in this film, and all the way through you can kind of get annoyed with how some people in this are manipulated so easily and forced to join sides. With some fun characters in the lighter moments, the film makes for a sweet main plot with the main character Shaun, but a dark and very dark of that vein with Combo, truly worth a watch if only for them two.The acting is good and Stephen Graham as the maniac of a skinhead Combo is great and although doesn't dominate the rest of the cast, probably gives the best performance. I felt the entire main gang are good and do there job really well throughout, with quirky people and angry people it makes for good balance that can shock the viewer. To say the cast is mainly from TV work they do an excellent job in transition to such a good drama, truly worth a watch as I say.Shane Meadows directs this well with some great well directing and moves the entire cast round really well. Meadows also writes it well and basically creates the wide variety of characters we see with hauntingly brilliant vision. I loved the location as it is based on a working class estate and they find some brilliant places coupled with brilliant shots too really show off the surroundings and even some shots and editing skills make the characters move so well and it all flows together nicely.Any bad things, I felt that although no real criticism comes in, you could always argue it sometimes turns from really light moments to dark moments in a click and that certain characters are just over the top crazy. I can't really prove that but hey, it is up to you the viewer to decide truly what you thought about it so maybe you can find any major criticisms.I think those who are from these kind of background will enjoy it, and especially those from the 80's who I feel will love the nostalgic joy ride. I think for those who like good drama will enjoy and people who love darker tone films with a sprinkle of funny moments will also enjoy the parallel genres. If you dislike swearing and a lot of violence or racism in a film, then avoid it because it is full of it, it is key to the plot for it to be there but just a heads up to those who dislike it.Overall a 8/10 meaning it is Safely Very Good, I felt some will think this is great, and others will dislike it for it's tones but it should be liked by the majority I would guess. Think about the messages this film portrays, and if you are from England like myself, you will see that you can feel shocked that this kind of thing was around not long ago.",This Is England

K. This film captures real life and centres on a young lad (Sean) who is bullied yet taken under the wing of both sides of the skin culture. As Sean battles to find an identity he sees the good and ugly.This film just as too many great points for me to document, the only reason it's a 9 is because due to overwhelming success a limited series was commissioned of the back of it.

The Mod/Hippie vibe of the era had all but soured out, giving way to a generation of punks,skinheads (both Oi,as well as National Front),Goths,etc. The central focus is a boy of 12,who had lost his father to the war in the Faulklands,who is bullied day after day in school,when he befriends a band of Oi skins,who feel empathy for his alienation. What starts out as a friendship with a ragtag bunch of skins & punks, turns nasty when one of the leaders of the gang has a visit from an old friend who has just been released from prison,and is now associated with the National Front (viscious Nazi skinheads). Things go from bad to worse when the boy is seduced into their hateful way of life. The cast of English unknowns (at least on these shores)is superb, the film making has a raw,crude,kitchen sink,DIY (do it yourself)look that works for this film. If you are put off by vulgar language,violence,racism,etc., you may want to avoid this one. Otherwise,this is a film that is well worth seeking out.",This Is England

He lives with his mother and spends his days listening to news reports of the Falklands War, where his father had recently been killed, struggling to adapt to life without his hero dad, Shaun's relationship with his mother is a little strained. He is bullied at school, his mothers insistence on choosing his clothes also makes him the brunt of jokes from all sides. On one such day he stopped by a gang of skinheads, their leader Woody shows an interest in the young lad and offers him advice and friendship, soon Shaun is a fully fledged member of the gang, the give him friendship, gifts and a new dress sense, Shaun has never been happier. All is hunky dory until Combo the erstwhile militant leader of the gang is released from prison, Combo's ideas of a new Britain and more racist slant alienates some the gang and there is a split, Shaun though, is touched by Combo's ideas and goes with him into a murkier, more dangerous world of hate and violence. This is a loose adaptation of director Shane Meadows childhood, a childhood that left him scarred mentally but stronger for life's teachings, here he has delivered his best film to date, a touching and harrowing story, full of gloriously colourful characters that sparkle with witty dialogue and vitriolic angry dogma. The film which uses mostly amateur or first time actors, recreates perfectly a time of social unrest in England, race riots, high unemployment, the miners strike, a country at war, anti nuclear protests, the film pulls no punches in firmly addressing who was to blame, but it doesn't get bogged down with tiresome political messages like say....a Ken Loach film, Meadows still has an eye on entertainment and this he delivers in spades, he touches on disturbing social issues with the greatest of craftsmanship and care and while he succeeds in shocking, he does so with an honesty and charm that makes this film a delight, All hail Meadows as the new Alan Clarke for he is surely Britain's biggest directorial talent.",This Is England
53,coldwaterpdh,Amazingly realistic portrait of racism in early 1980's Britain.,9,30 December 2008,"""This is England"" is one of the most poignant films about racism that I've seen. Set in early 80's England, it is the story of a wayward, intelligent young boy who loses his father in the Falkland War and drifts into the hands of a skinhead group led by a charismatic guy named Woody. I wouldn't call it a gang really, because they are mostly peaceful; goofing around, drinking beer, etc... They even have a Jamaican member. They remain peaceful until militant Combo gets out of prison and reclaims the kids from Woody. Combo is clearly someone who has been jaded by the inside of prison walls. He speaks of England's woes and troubles with immigrants taking jobs away from natives. He speaks so well that several of the skinheads, including young Shaun, abandon Woody and join him in a much more serious gang. They attend meetings of the National Front and Combo becomes increasingly violent and enraged with the social situation he has landed in. He ends up taking out his rage on one of his skinhead friends and beating him down in a flurry of punches and kicks to the head. Young Shaun witnesses it and is forever changed.Amazing acting, writing and direction highlight this film which I highly recommend to anyone who liked ""American History X"" or ""Made in Britain."" 9 out of 10, kids.",This Is England
54,gary-444,A Tremendous Tour De Force,9,25 November 2008,"Youth films are notoriously difficult to pull off.When created by the middle aged, they invariably miss the point. When created by peers, they invariably lack perspective. This amounts to a retrospective by a middle aged man, Director Shane Meadows, about his youth.As such it avoids the pitfalls, but benefits from hindsight and maturity.What sets this apart from so many films is the dialogue and characterisation. Every scene is carefully observed, and every character is carefully drawn so that we care about them. On the one hand we see the journey of the prepubescent Shaun, wonderfully played by Thomas Turgoose from lost soul to a key character in a skinhead group. On the other we see the violent, raging Combo,(Stephen Graham), recently released from prison, with hate in his heart but a tragedy and fragility about him which is equally as compelling.Meadows loves people, and there is not a wasted scene.Shaun is taken by his mother to buy some new shoes, he is determined that they should be Doc Martens Boots, she is determined that they should be ""sensible shoes"", and secures the acquiescence of the store assistant to that end. A wonderful vignette, what child did not experience that childhood battle of wills over a pair of shoes?In barely an hour and forty one minutes, Meadows delivers a searing polemic on the alienation of youth, the desolation of some communities in Thatcherite Britain, the festering breeding ground of racism,and the strength and joys of human inter action in groups.Although violent, foul mouthed and brutal, it is also funny, sharp and melancholic. At times the film almost slips into an elegiac nostalgic mood, before Meadows kicks it on with another sharp scene.A towering success, and proof that a strong narrative, good characterisation and strong dialogue, do not need a big budget and several writers.",This Is England

57,come2whereimfrom,This is brilliant.,8,2 December 2006,"After the success of 'Dead Man's Shoes' local filmmaker Shane Meadows returns with 'This is England' a story of absence and isolation, belonging and the power of persuasion. Set in 1983 with a backdrop of the war in the Falklands the film opens with a montage of relevant images everything from Maggie Thatcher to Knight Rider that really take you back and put you in the right space to meet Shaun. Shaun the films central character (played superbly by newcomer Thomas Turgoose) is a typical eighties kid, riding round on his griffter, washing neighbours cars for cash to buy a catapult and being constantly picked on for being different. When we first meet him we quickly learn that his father was a victim of the war raging at Maggie's command. Enter the gang Woody, Milky, Pukey, et all, a rag tag bunch of mods and skinheads complete with crimped haired girlfriends, with the absence of his father and any real sense of being part of something Shaun is quickly welcomed into the group and takes up not just the mannerisms or clothes but drinking, smoking and growing up to quickly. Things go OK for a while until Combo arrives on the scene. Straight out of prison and a British blooded skinhead through to his core you can sense trouble on the horizon. Soon the gang becomes segmented because of differences of opinion and fuelled by the war and the council estate mentality of accepting foreigners' things start to spiral out of control and Shaun finds himself in way above his head. A brilliantly written script that can at times have you laughing out loud and at others sitting nervously on the edge of your seat as the tension builds is delivered well by all the cast. The music is fitting, mixing eighties chart hits with haunting piano pieces and the cinematography is close to a previous Meadows outing 'A Room for Romeo Brass' which gives it a feel like it was filmed in the eighties. The attention to detail is brilliant as shop shelves are laden with products we no longer see or have long since upgraded there packaging. One of the scariest things was it was hard to imagine that time in this country because any of us who lived through it have almost chosen to block it out completely, but it was done so well and had me fishing in my memory to fit things into the time scale being used. There is defiantly a more matured Meadows at work here but he's lost none of his cheeky charm and observational skill and the characters he's created could have easily have lived next door to me growing up. The metaphor of the country getting behind Thatcher in the Falklands juxtaposed with that of the skinheads, including the initiated Shaun, getting behind the slightly off kilter Combo is handled with a great sense of poignancy and it is moving to see both stories unfold from within the film and library footage. Racism and intolerance are by no means behind us but here we are shown one of the skeletons in the Great British (sic) closet through the eyes of a child and one who would grow up to represent the next generation. Meadows has said in interviews that it is partly based on his experiences growing up and he sees a lot of himself in Shaun, I saw a lot of me in the character but I also saw memories I'd have rather forgotten. Funny, British and bleak Meadows is slowly climbing the ranks to join the Mike Leigh's and Ken Loach's of this world and if this film is anything to go by it wont take him very long. Any fan of Meadows previous work will love it and no doubt delight in his continuing growth as a filmmaker but everyone should see it regardless as it is another fine example of British film at its rawest and best.",This Is England
58,yris2002,"good young actors, for a bittersweet portrait of the British early 80's",7,11 September 2011,"Summer of 1983, an anonymous English town, marked by unemployment and lack of any social welfare, on the background the Falkland war: here, Shaun, a boy belonging to the working class, his father dead in that same war, always laughed at by his mates, one day meets a group of skinheads, who welcome him and become a sort of surrogate family for him. Things are at the beginning positive for the boy, until Combo, an ex member released from prison, arrives, leading what was a group of alternative but good boys, to encounter racist and violent attitudes and obliging everyone, Shaun included, to make a choice.What stands out in the movie is the capability to render the deep needs stirring inside the young boy, a need for strength, for something and someone to identify with, with all the complexities and difficulties proper of the age, and worsened by a troubled social context. The boy interpreting Shaun offers a very intense and strong performance, we cannot but have tender feelings for him, we feel how difficult it is to grow up, and still there's innocence in his eyes and there's the beauty of growing up believing in something. In general, all the characters are well rounded, credible and well interpreted. The director has done a great job in capturing the mood, the look and the music of those years, and criticism of the evils of the period is softened by the need for some final hope. It's certainly a committed movie, focusing on a specific moment of British history, but able to cross the boundary of a British audience.",This Is England
59,emuir-1,"Very depressing, but one to remember",5,29 October 2008,"I found the film overall to be depressing and I disliked the foul language, yet it is not a film that I will forget. It does give an insight into how the gangs recruit isolated young people. The young boy has recently lost his father in the pointless Falklands war. His mother is a quiet unassertive widow trying to cope with raising a young son as well as the loss of her husband in Margaret Thatcher's vanity war. They live in a dreary treeless council estate in a time of high unemployment as nationalized industries are being shut down and firms are moving to countries where costs are lower. The tourist England of the picture postcard villages, titled upper classes, Masterpiece Theater, boarding school, country pubs and everything we Anglophiles think of as England is not present in the lives of these young men. They might as well be living in a small town in the former Soviet Union. At first, the lonely fatherless boy is befriended by a bunch of cheerful, friendly, but aimless youths who take an interest in him more as a little mascot. Every gang has its wannabe who runs errands and makes the older boys feel more important. Suddenly he has a purpose and a sense of belonging to a family. All this ends when combo, a thug, comes out of jail and takes over. Things take a darker turn as Combo recruits them for the racist National Front. I was a little bothered by Steven Graham's Liverpool accent, as the film was set in East Yorkshire, but I told myself that he had probably moved in. I would have liked to see a more extensive ""making of"" documentary which explained where they found all those 80's items in the convenience store. Clothes and furniture are easy, but the small stuff and groceries! Although I found the film disturbing, after all, who wants to be entertained by watching young thugs fighting and swearing, it did give me more of an understanding of the hopelessness of the young men depicted in the film. If you want to be entertained, don't watch it. If you want to learn something, I recommend it.",This Is England
60,ExpendableMan,"What I did on my summer holidays, by Shane, aged 12 and three quarters",9,5 September 2007,"What do Roland Rat, Space Invaders, Skinhead violence and the Falklands War all have in common? They all figure in the opening sequence to This Is England, director Shane Meadows reflection on his own youth experiences growing up surrounded by poverty-infused gang climates. Consequently, it is a deeply personal viewing experience that takes a hefty emotional toll on the viewer but ultimately emerges as one of the most rewarding British films of the year. It paints a picture of Thatcherite Britain as a turbulent landscape of racism and mistrust in the government, not to mention examining the trials of being an angry young man living in isolation and resentment. However, it's not all doom and gloom as there is a remarkably positive side to the story as well, a fact that elevates This Is England into a superior comment on racism.Mainly, this is down to Meadows' willingness to show both sides of the skinhead equation. The unchecked aggression of Combo (the fantastic Stephen Graham) isn't too far removed from similar skinhead depictions in the likes of The Believer or Romper Stomper, but on the flip side of the coin is Woody (Joseph Gilgun). This young lad is the cheerful and charismatic leader of a gang whose biggest crimes are trashing abandoned houses for a laugh and painting a goal post on a wall in order to play football. When he takes young Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) under his wing, he doesn't do so to indoctrinate him into a white supremacist fold or encourage him to beat up immigrants, he just wants to cheer the lad up.But then there's the aforementioned Combo, a simmering ball of tension, insecurity and anger who having just been released from prison, returns to his old stomping grounds and sets about recruiting members of Woody's gang for the National Front. Some stay with Woody, others flock to Combo and a division forms between the two groups - half of them just want to have fun, the others though want to abuse Indian shop keepers and threaten Asian kids with flick knives. It's a far more detailed presentation of the complexities of skinhead culture, played out in such white-knuckle scenes as Combo's recruitment drive, or his uneasy friendship with Milky (Andrew Shim), a Jamaican youngster, that shows them laughing and smiling together one instant then threatening to explode in fury the next.Like all Meadows previous films, this is exceptionally well-written stuff. The action is largely told from the point of view of 12 year old Shaun and while the corruption of innocence is a familiar theme for the director, he hasn't come close to portraying it this well before. His ever reliable writing skills not only makes the characters seem realistic, but also manage to make scenes where people do little more than stand around talking into edge-of-the-seat moments. As Shaun continues his descent into the dark side of gang life, Meadows channels his own experiences into a compelling story of council estate frustration.So why call this 'one of the best British films' of all time? I must admit, I might be a little over-enthusiastic as I only just finished watching it and looking back over the previous paragraphs, I think it's obvious I'm still a bit bowled over. Even so, I think I can safely say that it's essential viewing for anyone even remotely interested in British film and not feel like cringing when I re-read this tomorrow morning. The look perfectly captures the feel of eighties Britain, the story is deeply compelling, the characters multi-dimensional and realistic and the acting is of the highest quality throughout.

It's an awesomely raw view on the skinhead epidemic that plagued England in the 70's and 80's. It has some very gripping moments, with slightly not so gripping moments, but pass the hour mark and this film really kicks into gear.

I guess it's just a self-indulgent trip down memory lane for a guy who must have had a seriously screwed-up childhood.There is nothing positive to say about this, and anybody who thinks differently must be deluded.

64,nesfilmreviews,All around impressive with two fantastic performances.,8,29 August 2013,"""This Is England"" sounds like your typical British film - concrete, plenty of rain, and of course the misery. In actuality, this couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the film buzzes with energy and humor, while propelled by brilliant, engaging performances.It's 1983 and 12-year-old Shaun Field (Thomas Turgoose) is an isolated lad growing up in a grim coastal town, whose father has died fighting in the Falklands war. After being persistently bullied, he finds role models when those in the local skinhead scene take him in. With his new friends, Shaun discovers a world of parties, his first love, and a sense of belonging. Here he also meets Combo (Stephen Graham), an older, racist skinhead, who was recently released from prison. As Combo's gang harasses the local ethnic minorities, Shaun is a willing passenger. But When Combo ups the ante and his propensity for violence increases, Shaun must make some difficult choices.There are two standout performances. The first is from child actor Thomas Turgoose, whose raw energy and pugnacious attitude are perfect for the character of Shaun. There's never a moment's doubt that he fully inhabits the character. Equally strong is Stephen Graham as the demented, charismatic Combo. Graham conveys both critical aspects of his character: the allure and the contempt. Combo is more than a heartless street thug, and that understanding is what makes Graham's portrayal so powerful.Meadows sentimentalism has sometimes gotten the better of his work, with tears and needlessly punishing violence, but not here.The film slows down and thickens as Shaun becomes embroiled in a subculture of hate – in moments, it's a little talky, but never loses its intensity. Shaun may embody hard times and bad breaks, but Mr. Meadows refuses to let him off the hook. His script and direction are virtually flawless. The one exception is the film's ending when it needlessly nails home the point once more, but no worries. The unrelenting heart and toughness of the film makes this one terrific British drama.",This Is England
65,Tcarts76,a tale of belonging,7,2 October 2012,"This is England is a decent story but at its heart it is a tale of belonging and how people fall into different social circles in order to obtain that feeling.The story is about a boy, Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) set in the 1980's, who is an outcast with school mates and lives alone with his mom after his father died in the Falklands war. He falls in with, after a chance meeting, with a group of skinheads, and quickly finds acceptance with them, even though he is somewhat conflicted.The movie itself was a decent one. The backdrop of 1980's England and the Falklands war was a perfect fit. I think the films portrayal of the skinhead group was a pretty accurate one. Usually in films like this it would have taken a more ominous route showing a lot more violence and showing the group as much more negatively ( and let's face it there is nothing good about racism). It simply shows them all as pretty much lost, sometimes scared young people just trying to get by, instead of a bunch of inhuman robot monsters.The only problem I had with this movie is that they got the look and feel of the 80's almost to well. In fact the actual camera work and filming made this entire story feel as if it was produced in the 80's. If it had been I probably would have given it a 9 or 10, but because it felt to dated in this day and age I can only give it a 7.I do however think the story is a valid one and a commentary that still rings true today with a lot of spotlights being shown on the problem of bullying.Like my reviews, hate em?

I thought that ""A Room For Romeo Brass"" was amazing. I thought that ""Once Upon A Time In The Midlands"" was not what it could have been and relied too much on the gimmick casting of too many well known British character actors. I thought that ""Dead Man's Shoes"" was a masterpiece.And so to ""This Is England"".In 1983 a lonely bullied young boy Shaun, who's Father has been killed in the previous years' Falklands conflict, makes friends with a group of skinheads. They are not clichéd skinheads. In the main they are nice, decent and even kind people. Shaun is made welcome. The group become a surrogate family to him. When a tough, racist, hardcore skinhead called Combo gets out of prison and reintroduces himself to the group, Shaun finds a Father Figure and the family starts to splinter.Despite, and I'll be charitable, some variable acting (there were a lot of people who had never acted before in this movie), ""This Is England"" is a good film.

On the whole a straight, powerful and unpredictable drama, with a good time era atmosphere and unavoidable anti-violence/racism message, but I fail to see the critically- and publicly hailed greatness.The substance has all the sure-fire success possibilities of a great movie, so why does it fail for me? It's mainly because of the boy protagonist Shaun, sorry to say, and this probably makes me a heretic: He. Simply. Does. Not. Grab. Me. The character, that is, since the actors are all solid. I just can't connect to him emotionally enough, because the crucial punch belongs to all the surrounding characters; and the weakest bit is the so-called romance with the girl ""Smell"". For such an overall high aim at realism, this emotional part is just not credible for a second and feels uncomfortably misplaced.The failure is also partly because the movie is too short and feels unfinished dealing with all its character's fates.

71,David_Frames,Some of my best friends are black shirts,7,3 May 2007,"This 80s set drama reinforces Shane Meadow's reputation as an actor's director and one that thank god, is actually interested enough in his indigenous culture not to take a cheque from a Hollywood studio and waste his talent making American genre movies. Danny Boyle take note. Paul Anderson, stay where you are.This is a considered, exceptionally well acted story centred on a 12 year olds adoption by a gang of skinheads in the months after his Father's death in the Falklands. Initially it's all harmless enough, smashing sinks and wasting time. They listen to good music and smoke dope  not a problem you may think, in fact I once worked for a man who essentially built a career on that. But things turn ugly when old gang member combo returns from prison, having had any vestige of racial tolerance buggered out of him. He's a proto-Nick Griffin, in the days before he opened an account with tie rack but with more visible tattoos, determined to fight the ""war"" against ethnic undesirablesand no, that doesn't means Geordies (I had to check that too). The boy is drawn in by Combo's pitch, particularly the part about wasted solders liberating sheep in the Falklands, which strikes a simplistic note and before you can say ""wasted youth"" trouble ensues.The period is vividly recreated, though Meadows can't resist having the greatest hits of the day playing on the radio as people walk down the street, and a cast who weren't even sperm and ovum in the real 1983, are superb and have a great career ahead of them, or rather would, were there an independent domestic industry to speak of. Mind you, Shane should be working for a while at least.What impresses are the finely rendered details. Mass recruitment to the National Front is portrayed in relatively benign terms  a cosseted meeting in a working men's club. There, then as now, a hatred of immigration and cultural diversity is rationalised as a rescue mission  hauling Englishness back from its diluted and fractious state to something bound to a fictitious idyll represented by the likes of Churchill (who opposed all emancipating reforms throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and pioneered the use of chemical weapons and labour camps), war time working class solidarity and that kind of male sack contents. Then, again as now, the ringleaders pass themselves off as respectable patriots, suited and business like, trotting out the familiar mantra of welcoming the hard working immigrant but rejecting the rest  ergo they're not racists at all. Obvious really! Having presented this pack of lies, Meadow's discredits it with equal verve. When combo storms into the hard working Pakistani shop owner's newsagent, threatens to kill him and steals his stock (because presumably working for it wasn't an option) there's little in the way of appreciation for the man's contribution to the economy. A simple ""thank you for the annual 2 billion pound surplus in 2007 money you and your fellow immigrants contribute, subsidising benefit dependent ex-cons like myself"" would have sufficed but no, its abuse a giant knife. As combo listens to Milk describe the simply pleasures of his family life  a scene that's like watching someone sit on a bomb you know is about to explode, his decision to try and batter him to death in a jealous rage is a tacit acknowledgement of what actually lies at the heart of the future BNP's membership - simple envy and bitter resentment coupled with an idiots view of history.When Meadow's explores the personal motivations for this hate his characters and the film as a whole have an air of authenticity, built on universally excellent and naturalistic performances. It's the attempt to tie the characters to the wider political and social context that strikes a false note.Meadows locates the mutation of the skinhead movement from anarchist to racist by showing us footage of the Falkland's war and Thatcher. Combos been in prison for three and half years and it isn't a coincidence that his captivity dates from Thatcher's accession to government  he's a symbolic globule of Thatcherite folly. Sending your armed forces to protect a hill and kill sheep Meadows suggests, proved a stark reminder of Britain's loss of status in the world and this, coupled with Maggie's systematic and ruthless destruction of the working class through mass employment and the atomising of society, which essentially ate like acid through traditional working class communities (which was always the point), was decisive in inflaming social tensions. This is a fair judgement of history but labouring the Falkland's as an inciting incident overstates its importance, when a more rigorous look at the domestic situation might have struck a stronger note. All of this suggests that while Meadow's is a vintage documenter of his own childhood experiences and has an gift for social realism, his credentials as a social historian are less secure.Mind you, this may be all a misreading. Perhaps Meadows is suggesting Roland Rat is responsible  the morning TV menace featuring in the opening archive footage, and who'd bet against it?",This Is England
72,Rathko,Refreshingly Authentic,10,28 February 2008,"Growing up in a small northern town in the '80s, I found 'This is England' to carry incredible resonance. For people from other countries to question the authenticity of the film is laughable. Take it from somebody who was there  this is how it was. I remember skinheads kicking off in pub car parks because they knew the police were too busy dealing with striking miners to respond to any complaints. The entire production looks so authentic that at times it's as though you're watching a documentary filmed in 1983. The actors imbue characters that could easily become stereotypes with a depth that makes even the near-sociopathic Combo a sympathetic and tragic victim of his own emotional retardation. Several performances are award worthy and 'This is England' contains more of the real England, the England of my childhood, in just five minutes than all the middle-class fantasies of Richard Curtis combined.",This Is England
73,RickHarvey,This is Fantastic,8,20 June 2010,"If there's any outstanding achievements in this film, then it has to be the cinematography. This film looks beautiful. Not in a flowery, greenery way but in a style that rough and dirty. You could easily be mistaken that this film was made in the 80s cause there's no fault with the design. Immediately the setting hooks you in.With child actors, you often find them annoying or brilliant, Thankfully, Thomas Turgoose is fantastic. From the beginning you feel for him. Losing his dad in a phony war , living in a council estate and constantly being picked on. Despite this happening to him , he always responds in ruthless manner , a manner which you just have to admire. With him, you are taken into the world of skinheads. They do the things you expect them to be doing, Vandlising, drinking , ordering a brew in the café. It not until the extreme skinhead Combo arrives that the film begins to take off.Stephen Graham who plays Combo is just outstanding. he steals the show. With highlights such as his arrival and his epic speech,you quickly become attached with him. Combo is just one of many well thought out characters. Woody is fantastic and so is milky. The dialogue is executed with perfection and emotion.This film is outstanding. You know if your going to like a film or not in the first ten minutes. This is England captures from the first minutes and from there you become extremely involved with the characters. Meadows hasn't made a film in which it will appeal to the majority of the viewing public. May will find this extremely shocking while many just won't be able to relate with the setting or the characters. Well, if that the case then at least you can admire the beauty of the film.

Think again.",8,25 May 2007,"You don't need to be told we are in the eighties in This Is England. The opening montage of rubik's cubes, the Falklands war, new romantics and the royal wedding set the scene for this tale of sub-culture gone balls up. 12-year-old loner Shaun (a fantastic Turgoose) is having a tough time at school. Not affiliated with any type of clique, be it new romantics, punk rockers or skinheads, he finds it hard to blend in with anyone. Having lost his father to the Falklands conflict, he is in desperate need of fatherly guidance, as his mother cannot cope by herself. After a chance encounter coming home from school, he befriends, or rather is befriended, by a group of skinheads, who take him under their wing. They shave his head and give him a brand new wardrobe of shirts with braces. The group are multi-cultured and fairly discreet politically, that is, until they are infiltrated by the ringleader's cousin  Combo. He gestates his feelings of England ""being overrun"" by Asians, and even goes as far to prod the group's black member whether he considers himself English or Jamaican. What began as a love of reggae music and bizarre hairstyles turns into a statement of fascism, as Combo gets the remaining gang to intimidate, rob and threaten every foreigner they see.As is the case with much of Meadows' other work, This is England makes good use of improvised dialogue, documentary-style cinematography and an aura of authenticity. He makes simple films, but films that clearly know the subjects they tackle. Meadows, himself, admits to having grown-up as a skinhead, both before and after the sub-culture was infiltrated by the far right. You never get the feeling an outsider is telling you this tale, the characters are never patronised, it is not a youthsploitation movie, nor does it take the easy option of just painting all skinheads as Nazis. What you get is, a sympathetic insight into a northern English world, which has been tainted by Thatcherism, and slowly engulfed by racial tension and hate. It is not preachy, and never talks down to its audience. What it is  is very, very good.",This Is England

78,ereinion,The fight for England becomes the fight for one boy's soul,9,3 June 2016,"This movie is full of tragedy, yet also redemption. It is a story about one young boy who ends up in the wrong crowd. It is 1983 and Shaun is a 12-yearold boy whose father was killed a year ago in the Falklands War. Worth noting is the choice of year, as it was a time of major political and social upheaval in Britain. Miner strikes and dissatisfaction with Thatcher's regime. It is this dissatisfaction that also is shown here, albeit from a very extreme perspective of the skinhead leader Combo. Combo is a character full of contradictions, as he is both a racist and nationalist, and at the same time in denouncing the Falklands War as a rubbish Thatcher-invention, he is also talking the language of the common man, the oppressed man. Those who have been hurt by the war the most are people like him, people who had no grudge against Argentina but had to fight in that war, millions of miles away from home. While at the same time many so-called ""respectable"" and ""politically correct"" Englishmen and Britons supported that war and many still think it was right to fight it. This shows the yawning gap between the working class and the upper class. Working class is sick of having to take foreigners from third world countries ""taking over"" their neighbourhoods with their stores and restaurants and ""taking their jobs"", while the government does nothing and profits from the foreign ""injection"".Shaun is a kind of objective figure here, who is never too much on either side, even though he accepts Combo as a sort of father figure or big brother figure. I think even the ones among us who hold some kind of grudge towards the immigrants, especially ones from afar, will feel sickened by the scene where Combo holds a knife against an Indian boy's throat, just because he and his friends played football on ""his"" court. Even if some of us have had negative experiences with for instance a Pakistani or Indian, watching this makes us pity that Indian boy. I know it made me feel like that and it took away any kind of grudge I might have felt towards their kind. Stephen Graham does a great job as Combo and the young Tom Turgoose also is very effective for a debutante and for his age. This is a film everyone should watch and learn from. It is a young boy's spiritual education, as Shaun finally realizes that his father didn't die fighting for the nationalist, racist England but for a united England. And everyone must accept that their society has changed.Combo is one unhappy, tormented character. A guy who was obviously scarred early in life and cannot feel anything but anger, or can he? Despite always trying to look as cold and hard as possible, he harbours feelings for Lol, the girlfriend of his friend who then turns away from him because of his racism, after Combo returns from prison. After he gets rebuked by Lol for confessing his feelings for her, he gets more dangerous. He only wants to feel loved and to have a good life, but can't. He hangs out with losers for the most part. One exception is the mild-mannered Milky, the half-Jamaican. This all makes you wonder: is Combo really a racist? Or is it only anger and frustration that make him say and do racist things? This is a very strong character study and one of the few films I have seen to try and deconstruct what lies behind, or inside, an average racist and his mind.I give this film a 9, because it is a very compelling and important film and a good lesson for any young man who may harbour some kind of animosity towards people of other race. Feeding on hatred and living on hatred will only make you miserable and end in tragedy, as it does for Combo. But one can hope that he is headed towards finding redemption as well, while Shaun found the right way to go.",This Is England
79,kikkapi20,"Please, please, please, let me.....GET WHAT I WANT (FOR A ONCE).",9,13 August 2014,"It's 1983 and school is out. Twelve-year-old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is a lonely boy growing up in a grim coastal town in northern England, whose father died fighting in the Falklands War. Over the course of the summer holiday he befriends a group of local skinheads. With his pent- up anger and frustration, Shaun finds exactly what he needs in the gang – mischief, mayhem and brotherhood. He also meets the volatile and boorish Combo (Stephen Graham), an older skinhead who sees himself in Shaun. Adopting Shaun as his protégé, Combo leads the gang down a hate-spewing path that culminates in an irreversible act of violence. An uncanny evocation of a quietly pivotal moment in time, THIS IS ENGLAND bears witness to a young boy's coming of age while Britain's empire fades, Thatcherism devastates the working class, and skinhead culture takes a violent turn toward racist nationalism. Ambitious, deeply personal, and beautifully realized, THIS IS ENGLAND firmly establishes Shane Meadows as one of the most compelling filmmakers of his generation.",This Is England
80,manicman84,deals with difficult issues in both masterly and accessible way,10,12 August 2007,"Set in Uttoxeter, England during the 1980s, ""This Is England"" tells the story of an 11-year-old boy who shaves his head and falls in with an older neo-Nazi gang after his father dies in the Falklands war. This is England does practically the same to England as Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing did to the United States. Its message about overcoming prejudices and racism is always important, but now it's delivered in so socially relevant film that it's impossible to ignore it. Director Shane Meadows depicts partially autobiographical story of a child who gradually becomes brainwashed into radical nationalism. As a real masterpiece should do, the movie perfectly works on many levels. First, it's a great portrait of young people who do not have any future prospects. Secondly, it works as a sentimental journey into the past which seems not so bad after all. Finally, it's an engrossing study of relations in a group and how easily one can be manipulated into some totally ridiculous totalitarian ideology. The movie avoids unambiguity, which is paradoxically its main virtue. The leader of the skinhead group, Combo superbly played by Stephen Graham is incredibly complex, fascinating character whose motivations are not easily understandable. The first-time actor Thomas Turgoose as Shaun also delivers deadpan performance balancing between skinhead pathos and moral sentiments. Director Shane Meadows expertly directs providing Shaun with realistic surroundings and delivering some comic relieves between very tense scenes. All in all, ""This is England"" is a flick dealing with difficult issues in both masterly and accessible way. No wonder it won over ""The Last King Of Scotland"" and ""The Queen"" at Independent British Film Awards.",This Is England
81,thomas-hardcastle-2,This is England.....This is a good film.....,8,27 August 2008,"I thought this film was very good. It gave great insight into the minds and attitudes of the down-trodden in England in the nineteen eighties, and adds to the director's impressive resume of decent films.Thomas Turgoose deserves a special mention for what, at his age, is incredible acting. Normally when I see a kid in a movie, I want to punch their lights out (Macauley Culkin, Jake Lloyd, etc.), but in this film, Turgoose's portrayal of the main character allows the audience to feel empathy and admiration towards him.The ensemble cast of predominantly young actors were impressive, and made the film watchable and warm.The subject matter of the film is dark, but actually happened and still happens today, therefore the violence and reasoning behind the violence is necessary for true insight into the characters and the zeitgeist. One scene in particular was rather upsetting, but had already been explained previously, although not condoned.Overall, this is a terrific film, worth buying, worth keeping, and worth loving.",This Is England
82,moimoichan6,Sweet sixteen,6,3 November 2007,"I praise the quality of today's English cinema, that manage to give us few of the best movies of this year : from the horrific ""28 Weeks later"" to the depressing biopic ""Control"" (and I'm not talking about the spaced ""Sunshine"", the hilarious ""Hot Fuzz"", or the documented ""The Future is unwritten""). Once again, ""This is England"" comes to prove that Truffaut was wrong when he said that England and Cinema were two antinomy's terms. The movie is a little less good than its reputation(from the critics to its prize at Cannes), but gives an touching and realistic portrait of England in the 80's.The all movie focuses on the point of view of a 12/13 years old boys, who's rejected by his fellow friends at school, but is attracted by an older group of Skinheads. Unfortunately, the leader of the group has some nationalist acquaintances from a friend that just comes out of jail, and the young boy will be tempted to fallow by this easy nationalist/racist paths. If this story doesn't always avoid some facilities, it's rather an achievement for the film not to focus so much on the thesis (England and Nationalism, the way people are dragged into that, etc.) but on its characters. To sum up, it's far to be a Ken Loach movie, and that's maybe for the best here. And it's the portrayal of a few characters that is really moving in this movie, from the sympathetic young skinhead leader, that knows where to throw a line and to refuse nationalist, to the sad and lonely 'vilain' of the movie. And of course, the young Shaun character, although his young age, is also amazing and very credible. The set up, the music and make up are also very well done, and the all reconstitution is very pleasant. Even if it's not very original, you can feel the sincerity of the director, and the sympathy he have for its characters.",This Is England
83,Michael-70,"Tough, Uncompromising and Very Well Acted. This film is very painful at times.",10,17 August 2007,"Shane Meadows film about skinheads in England circa 1983 is a powerful look at dispossessed youth seen through the eyes of 12-year-old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) whose father was killed in the Falklands. Although short and chubby, he's a tough little kiddie; one of the first scenes with Shaun has him standing up to an adult Pakistani shop owner who subsequently bans the little tyke from his store.Later on, while Shaun is en route home from school after he has gotten into yet another fight (is this a scrappy kid or what?) he runs into some good-natured skinheads lazing under a walkway. At first afraid they are going to tease him, they soon befriend the little guy and provide him with a group identity culminating with him getting his head shaved and being outfitted with tight jeans and suspenders.At first, it is all fun and games with this surrogate family especially with the charismatic Woody (Joseph Gilgun) a skinhead who is smart, decent and possessed of a wicked sense of humor (his impression of a cultured rich boy is hilarious), but the good times end when Combo (a brilliant Stephen Graham) arrives on the scene.Combo is an older skinhead, fresh out of jail for some unexplained crime and clearly hardened by his time inside. Combo and Woody were once mates, but Combo is now a changed man. Unable to succeed in school, employment or crime apparently, he now has a festering hatred for non-Brits, whom he obviously blames for his poor showing in life.Immediately, young Shaun gravitates toward Combo and Combo likes the little spitfire too, saying he can see himself in the little guy. Of course he can, they are both twelve years old emotionally. But Combo is nothing if not charismatic and he is able to sway this nice group of skinheads toward a darker purpose which is to some how take England back from whomever seems to have it now. The politics are ludicrous, but the mission is articulated in loud, clear terms that don't require any thinking, just brute action. The smart skinheads with any compassion or questions quickly get tossed out.This Is England is a powerful film with lots of heart-stopping tension and dread as things go from bad to worse with Combo leading up to a major violent encounter. It is interesting that the thing that sets off Combo begins as a pleasant talk with a Jamaican skinhead named Milky (Andrew Shim) while they are all sitting around high and drunk one night. Milky talks lovingly about his large extended family and mentions how he always admired his father, because no matter what, his father always managed to put food on the table.Mind you, this is now late at night and these guys have been smoking weed and now have the munchies something terrible and there is nothing to eat in the house. This starts Combo down a mental pathway that leads him to perceive that Milky is criticizing his own father (who we surmise was not as good a bread winner as Milky's Dad). This is just Combo's stupid psychopathology, but it is enough for Combo to beat Milky almost to death in a scene of violence as brutal as anything I've seen in cinema.I liked that This Is England makes it clear that not all skinheads are racist thugs, although way too many are. Woody and some of the others are basically decent teens on a rebellious streak, but they will soon grow up and without selling out per se, most will become productive adults. But the film makes it very clear that if you simply ignore these angry young men, they will form their own groups for better or worse.If nothing is done, by the time these young men reach Combo's age, they may already be lost. It is a tribute to Stephen Graham as Combo that he makes you feel the pain and understand the hard times he's had to live with, without making him seem sympathetic. For example, we come to learn that his one big romantic moment in life, was in fact nothing more than a drunken shag with a 16-year-old girl. Combo says it was the best night of his life, while the girl tells him it was the worst night of hers. So Combo is really just an immature boy-chick with an easily broken heart.But now Combo has an adult body and adult strength although his mind is pretty childlike. It would be all too easy to just dismiss Combo as a pathetic loser, which he is, but neither the script nor the actor does that. This film warns us not to take the easy way out and dismiss all fascists as nothing more than lonely boys who just need a good talking to from dear old Dad. That simply isn't true. Some of these people are simply pathetic malcontents bent on nihilism and destruction.Typically, it is everyone's fault but their own. Like with the anti-immigrant people here in America who tell you foreigners are lazy and just want to collect welfare. There is a Vietnamese woman who runs a newsstand where I buy my papers six days a week and she is there in the morning when I leave for work and still there when I pass by on the way home in the evening. Except for a couple of days here and there where it looks like another family member helps out, she is always working. This woman is not lazy.But she is exactly the kind of person the anti-immigrant people want to punish. Don't let them fool you with their claims that they are only concerned about illegal immigration, you won't see them fighting to repatriate illegal Canadians, British, Irish or Australians. It is strictly the non-white ones they're against and they think we don't notice.",This Is England

Shouldn't they be for it? Why is there no women at the right wing rally? All the adults act like they are children with no responsibilities, ready to tear down the world, but we see none of them confront that. This movie is American history X with paper thin characters. The characters have no motivation to do anything, you would think that this gang would have some way to bring in cash like dealing drugs or something? Why is there a huge gap between the 12 year old and the woman? I just see this as a self insert from the writer. It just doesn't make sense.",This Is England
85,winopaul,Proves the opposing point,6,6 November 2010,"First off, this movie is great simply because it starts off with Toots & the Maytals' ""54-46 Was My Number"". Dig it out on Utube and play it about 500 times and you still can't get it out of your head. My Samoan buddy Etene Fau used to play this song when he was in the Bay area but I had never heard the original. Man does this bring back good memories. Anyway, after playing Toots & the Maytals' ""54-46 Was My Number"" 500 times you can work in Nina Simone's Sinnerman about 50 times and you will be ready to watch this depressing and slightly amateurish movie. OK, it is supposedly autobiographical, so I guess the writer/director is trying to apologize for being a Nazi skinhead when he grew up. He does this by trying to blame his peers and environment and mommy. This does indeed show he has become a true liberal, blaming his shortcomings on others. It was society's fault he was an stupid kid.In addition to trying to show he was just a cute little kid that was unduly influenced by every weirdo street hobo he ran across, the movie tries to make some big sweeping comments about war and hate. This comes off so amateurish as to be infantile. As a coming-of-age movie I guess it was politically correct, after all the kid does reject the skinhead movement after he sees violence first-hand. The problem is, this is the exact wrong point. The fact of the matter is that the hate and senseless violence fueled some change and that is the point-- the elite will not give up their cushy sinecures just because it is the right thing to do. You have to beat it out of them. This has been true for 500.000 years of human development and it is not going to change soon. You can make the exact same movie and substitute Black Panthers for skinheads. Just flip the skin color of everybody in the movie. The Panthers were unjust self-serving a$$holes just like the skinheads. But I tell you what, if it wasn't for the Panthers, Martin Luther King would have gotten nowhere. The only reason the American political elite accepted civil rights was because it was less painful than a bullet in the forehead. So the stupid ideology and pathetic racism of the skinheads was not the point. The whole movie should have been examined how humans form political and economic bonds, and especially how we trump up religion in order to go attack and kill a bunch of other humans and take their stuff. You can poutch out your lips and make tsk tsk sounds all you want. You are living in a house or flat that people exactly like the skinheads or the Black Panthers took from some other group. Maybe it was American Indians, maybe it was Celts or Normans or whatever gang-of-the week was occupying England at the time. We all love to eat the tasty burger, nobody wants to drive the iron rod into the cow's head and cut up dear ol' Elsie so we can fire up the Bar-B-Q. We all love living in ""our"" houses, as long as idiots like Combo or Malcolm X or Joan of Arc or Osama Bin Laden do the dirty work and take it from someone else, or at least the land that it stands on. This was an interesting movie but for the opposite reason the director intended. He had the same problem as Terry Gilliam in Brazil, making a bleak and horrid subject entertaining. But when you look at this movie as a documentary it is perfectly satisfying. In that view the ending is very sad, since we see that the little boy is really a pansy with no loyalty or convictions and without the stomach to really fight for any belief. The movie should end like that Geico commercial with R Lee Ermey calling him a jackwagon and throwing a tissue box at him.OK, I am clowning a bit and being too hard on the director. But think about what this teaches us about history. How the Persian empire was built across racial bounds. As long as you accepted Islam you could be a general. Before that, Alexander the great would not kill the defender of a city he attacked as long as the guy was out front fighting his butt off. Meritocracy trumping race or creed. We can see how the moral base for forming alliances and then stealing from your fellow man has changed from family to clan to city-state to religion, where finally race does not matter,-- to what? What will be next? I assume some BS imperialism like the USA where we shout freedom! freedom! freedom!, drop the bombs, set up the puppet, and pump out the oil. And so I any less of a hypocrite than this film when I shout objections to our wars and then go gas up my Honda for 3 bucks a gallon? Mmmmm that's a tasty burger.Oh yeah, major kudos to all the actors-- the guy that played Combo was way better than Russell Crowe in his skinhead dork movie. The kid was excellent and so were all the other players. They were so strong that I did not even notice if there were deficiencies in camera or lighting or set decoration.

Not all of the elements come together completely, particularly some unlikely character situations, especially seen through today's eyes. But this is character driven drama, with each having their own detailed arc, which is juxtaposed to to the shaping social and political atmosphere around them. This is beautifully portrayed and the characters are so well chronicled and acted to perfection that you seem to forget about the unlikelihood of some of their situations.

The whole cast is dynamite as well as director Shane Meadows who I've been following since Midlands and his masterpiece Dead Man's Shoes (with the also great Paddy Considine).

Set in 1983, year of clunky boots, Return of the Jedi (any excuse for Star Wars to be mentioned) and mass mob murder. Decade of less prominent political correctness, skin heads and racism. Shaun, a puppy eyed, foul mouth, who lost his dad in the Falkland war was a character based on the experiences of Shane Meadows himself.And similar to the way the rise and fall of mafia life has been portrayed effortlessly, youth culture is remarkably parallel. Same degree of respect, nicknames, 'You watch my back and I won't stab yours' attitude and the change of a once light hearted atmosphere in a blink of a twitch. Shaun learns this as we learn it, often lashing out unexpectedly because of it, or giving into it through peer pressure, making the whole experience unsettling. Saying that, he's a child and savours the companionship whether it be good or bad or temperamental and as much as you hate to see him drown in what is so blatantly wrong, he enjoys it with every once of ignorance a child of his age should.Meadow's films it like anything that calls itself a drama should. Though the phrase docudrama wouldn't be totally inaccurate either; the close-ups, with their heavy breathing, heavy silence and piercing stares into to nothingness or more effectively at you. Then there's the whole thematic vortex that American History X spun with an indispensable rotation, by balancing the racism and redemption near flawlessly. This is England, can't quite weigh down the latter as much as it could have, but the racism never feels unlike the characters or excessive to the point of nauseating; it's all precisely handled as emotive monologues and not just violence swiftly followed by a racist jibe.It's as powerful as it is offensive, as poignant as it is vicious and as precise as it is brilliant. If this is England, Hollywood's not quite stole all the limelight just yet.",This Is England
90,unemployedvirgin,A Powerful & Dark British Story,10,23 September 2010,"The director's life experiences come alive for all to witness in this film. Soon as I pressed play I did not want to move from my bed, my assumptions before hand were that this movie would simply be a skinhead's paradise for the whole 90 minutes. However, like any negative exterior there is always a stronghold of human spirit shown internally. As the viewer I began to see the fundamental structure that is family and a feeling of belonging which shapes any group or gang no matter what the motive.Although I found the racism to be a little uncomfortable at times I understand that it has to be shown in context with the times of each situation, the comedy softened the blows of that. As always I'm keen on a good music score and soundtrack, that definitely delivered throughout the picture. The film had a biographical feel to it which made it better for a younger generation like me to interpret what the past was like.Conclusion: A powerful and dark insight into English beliefs, not only a good film but also a frozen time capsule which has been the building blocks for the situations facing the United Kingdom today. 10/10",This Is England

95,Skint111,For the politically naive and or lefties,6,10 April 2008,"A kind of compilation of bits from the director's previous features, this honest, vivid drama gains from its naturalistic performances and observant asides, but has brutal and hysterical extremes that may alienate many audiences. The director no doubt fells strongly that yes, this is England. As a left winger he will be keen to play up the bad aspects of his country and down play anything positive. Such is his policy on this movie. Don't get me wrong, the film is well made and well acted but to say it offers an unbiased view of England is laughable. The left in the media love to paint anyone who questions mass immigration as a Nazi or a fascist. It is just not credible to them that the National Front had people in it who were perfectly normal, decent people who felt frustrated about the changing face of their country and the mainstream politicians' inability to do anything about it. Sir Keith Joseph voiced such an opinion. According to people like Meadows, skinhead thugs were the prototype NF members. This was not the case. Where this film really falls to pieces is at the end when the Falklands conflict is equated with what has gone before. The determination to embed the narrative in a political context is misguided at best and insensitive at worst. It is really no surprise to me that lesser film critics, who are all liberal left, have praised this film so much, where the odd wiser one, like the chap in the Telegraph, have exposed it for what it is: a blustering, fake, sham of a picture with pretensions to say so much more than it has the genuine intellect to.",This Is England

Almost all the characters are fleshed out and really give something to the flow of the movie. There are like one or two minor characters that really don't matter but then again this is an autobiography of the director's childhood,so maybe they mattered to him. They really worked hard to make costumes and sets like the 80's. It feels like you are actually watching an 80's movie. I was most impressed with Thomas Turgoose's performance. Now that kid has true talent. I would love to see more movies with him in it.

Great watching the beginning with all the old eighties clips.... those were the days. Shows the two sides to skinheads... not all are racist. Being a ska/mod fan I knew/know plenty of old skins/mods/punks and think I've only come across a few that are racist and trouble makers... the majority of them are just normal people who may dress differently but good people. The films shows the two sides and how maybe the racist skinhead Combo was the one with issues. Also shows how the eighties made u feel as if u had to belong to a certain group or feel on your own. I can remember the different groups and i hated it... even now i feel i'm individual. I do think British films get a lot of stick and don't get the credit they deserve... American films always seem to go for the slim good looking people...perfect skin/hair.... where as us English realise that everyone is different and this films shows the difference. Who cares if the leading lad isn't drop dead gorgeous like someone else commented...does that make him less of an actor.

100,stephparsons,A powerful slice of 1980s England,9,26 June 2013,"This is England is a powerful, biting, dark, (yet captivating), 'slice' of 1980s England encompassing the political/socioeconomic climate and the disaffected youth and subcultures that arose as a result. Set in a depressed Midland's town, a year after the Falkland's War, England's focus is Shaun, a twelve year old boy played outstandingly by Thomas Turgoose, who lost his Father in the war. Shaun, who lives with his unemployed Mother on a grim housing estate, endures bullying and becomes an outcast among his peers who make fun of his unfashionable clothes and, more pertinently, his dead Father. This is the catalyst that leads Shaun to accept the friendship of a local gang of skinheads who take pity on him and offer the attention he's been craving. The gang, lead by Woody, (Joseph Gilgun), seem harmless enough at first and Shaun enjoys being its youngest member and discovers a sense of belonging, along with his newly acquired 'skinhead uniform' .England does a top notch job in its portrayal of the early 80s, through grainy montages of significant events and political turmoil; attention to the fashions and subcultures of the times, and a soundtrack truly faithful to Britain in the early 80s. It cleverly immerses watchers in a significant era where Thatcher ruled with her infamous iron fist; unemployment was rife; and conditions were ripe for the National Front to spout its rhetoric under the thinly veiled guise of 'English pride', successfully gaining support and endorsing ultra nationalism while turning a blind eye to the resulting mindless violence. When Woody's mate Combo is released from jail and forces the gang to choose between his way (a loose interpretation of the NF's agenda), or Woody's way (basically living in harmony with his friends, including those of other ethnicities), Shaun, outraged by Combo's declaration that the Falkland's War was 'invented' by Thatcher and that those who died in it lost their lives for nothing, takes a stand against him and in doing so actually gains Combo's respect and goes on to be schooled in so-called 'English pride' by Combo's gang. Shaun is too young and naive to really grasp what he is being made to 'stand for' but is hooked by a sense of 'belonging', and the praise and attention he receives transform Combo into something of a father figure in Shaun's eyes.England not only astutely conveys the mood, political atmosphere, subcultures and zeitgeist of the early 80s, it does so with unparallelled verve and attention to detail. This birds eye view 'retrospective' will resonate with anyone who came of age in the era of The Falkland's War and experienced the government's efforts to 'distract' the general populace from the recession by enlisting the military to exert its might in re-capturing a 'British territory'. This 'call to arms' is reflected in Combo's right wing zeal but when his fanaticism goes too far and causes grievous injury to a friend, both he and Shaun get a wake up call and the subterfuge of 'English pride' is shattered and exposed for what it really is.Some of the subtleties of England may well be lost on a North American audience, but I don't think this diminishes its power, mesmerizing script, and well thought out screenplay. Yes, It may be rather bleak, and certainly disturbing in parts, but don't let this put you off. If anything, you will come away from England with a sense of satisfaction - and that's all I'm going to say. I urge you to watch it and see!",This Is England

We watch an astounding progression from loner, to member of a harmless clique of 80's British punks, to a skinhead... but most importantly you see the point when the decisions of change are made and the reasoning behind them. There is a scene in the film after Shaun is shaved, dressed up to fit in with his fellow comrades, and walks with them in a grimy, dirty area with a backdrop of rust brightly colored fences that totally captures the essence of not only this film but that entire era for England as well...

It's funny, visceral and, ultimately, unbearably moving. The central performance that Meadow's has elicited from Thomas Turgoose is astonishing, one of a number of great naturalistic turns by a largely unknown cast, although Stephen Graham also deserves particular mention for his role of Combo, a presence of hate-filled insanity I've not witnessed since Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet. This is also one of the most affecting films I have ever seen to deal with the Falklands War, to some, another illegal enterprise engendered to bolster the ailing support of Thatcher's regime, providing the social attitudes necessary to give birth to the likes of Combo and a new form of racist fueled nationalism. I remember some men handing out National Front leaflets at my school gates around this time... Meadows evocation of early 80's Britain is faultless. For me, the nostalgic aspects of this film are presented in incredible detail with the use of footage from the time and, as ever, the soundtrack is beautifully constructed. This is England...

This film portrays the 80's right down the the cheap smut and the general feel of the sets. As a skinhead from the 1980's complete with all the trappings, racism (even though some of our mates were (still) black, tattoo's, the tacky cheap shed sex talk, cheap booze, spliffing it, shoplifting from the local Spa, getting caned at school and getting into some mega punch-ups with the local ""paki's"" and other ethnics this was a ""mirror"" of me! Even the flats they frequented are just like the ones I lived in (I checked the old Poloroids). It's a very uncanny remake of a bygone era that will envelope you as the film progresses into the climax of race hate which was a bit unclear to why it flared up in the first place. The one liners and dialogue are quite brilliant and so realistic to point where I though I was watching a documentary unfold in front of us. One interesting thing was the way the the film was filmed. Either it was the state of my local cinema or the fact that the end result appeared to filmed on a old reel to reel that gave the effect that you were actually watching a brand new documentary from the 1980's shown on BBC2. The whole thing was very risqu and dared to peel back the reality of living with the skinhead ideal.For those of you who remember the Thatcherite years, Falklands and Raleigh Grifters will love it. The living room sets are just so frightengly true, the general grittiness of it all, the look and feel of it will get to the bare bones of era that is so clear in my mind.It's a case of the mirror still works, it's the reflection that has changed.....AR",This Is England

Gritty, ultra-real story telling (not least because it reflects time and events from Meadows own childhood.From the outside this movie might look like an all out ""Doom and Gloom"" exercise (akin to Nil By Mouth?), but it is so much more! It has a great sense of love and nostalgia for the time and place-not too mention the Skinhead culture. However, it also shows how the initially innocent fashion trend of the Skinhead- which came from the ""Mods"" and ""Ska"" music scene- was twisted and subverted by a racist element from within. Fashioning a striking look (near bald heads with imposing Dr Martin boots) a perfect foil for those wanting to make a clear impression of aggression for the National Front.Performances are great- Turgoose as the young fatherless lonely boy- searching for someone to lead the way. Special mention to Stephen Graham as the aggressive, neo-Nazi, Combo. He is a horribly violent man, but played with such depth by Graham, you can see he has his own issues which have destroyed him. Ultimately, he is the saddest and most tragic of all the characters in it.Graham's is an Oscar/Bafta performance if ever there was one!

110,polos_are_minty,This is Cinema,9,8 April 2010,"This is England is a very engrossing and enjoyable film. From the opening titles, which is the brilliant montage of images from the 1980s, right through to the closing scenes of the film keeps a high level of entertainment and of brilliant cinematography.The director, Shane Meadows, has made a collection of small and independent dramas. Many of which are worth viewing, I however think that This is England is by far his best film. Meadows when shooting encourages actors to ad lib when they are not the centre of attention, he says that this leads to a more natural look, and creates more realism. I completely agree with him on this note. The film is nothing, if not realistic. The characters are endearing, the shots are natural, and the dialogue is really how people speak.The film has a very serious message at its heart, which is of course the dangers of a certain type of national pride. Although it is set in the 1980s it is definitely not only a commentary on that era, but on modern day England. However despite its serious message the film manages to install a lot of humour into many of the scenes. The character of Gadget is mainly used for this purpose, being the obvious comic relief, when compared to the far more serious leader figures of Woody and Combo. That said, although Gadgets presence is for comic relief, he still manages to be a useful and important character on the serious side of things.The acting of the lead is impressive to say the least. I am normally not a fan of many child actors. I often find them lacking in range and ability compared to their adult counterparts. However Shaun is very impressive for someone so young. He adds so much to the film, and without his presence it would really lack a lot of the authentic feel that the picture has.The film screams 1980s. The opening titles serve to take us back to the era in which the film is set, at the same time conjuring up a sense of nostalgia amongst the viewers. The colouring and way the film is shot, also makes for an authentic 80s picture. Nothing about it says modern day, and there are no anachronisms that I have noticed. The authentic period feel is important in making the viewer actually believe that what they are seeing is the 1980s. Everything from the clothing, to hair styles, to cars was correct. Without these things it wouldn't work, and I'm thankful that Meadows has an eye for the minor details which combine to make this film work.The major theme is of course about the dangers of racism, although hinted at in the early parts of the film, it doesn't really come into full fruition until about half way through, with the appearance of the excellent Combo. The character of Combo is brilliant, although his racist views and some of his attitudes are of course abhorrent, the character is still an interesting one. Throughout the film he portrays this image of a hard man, who has done time, he presents him self as someone who is proud to be white, he comes across as typical of certain members of the National Front groups. Yet, as is the point of the film, his character is shown to be human, the scene with Lol in the car is particularly memorable.I have mentioned the opening montage, but I must briefly mention one of the others. The montage which shows, Seans transformation into the racist skinhead is fantastic. The interplay of the flag, and the music in this scene really come together to create a compelling and drawing scene. Meadows manages to grab hold of your attention, and refuses to release it.I do have criticisms about this film. Its sentimentality is both one of its impressive and its irritating features. It seems to me that Meadows, is in someways longing for a time which was in many ways terrible. He also sometimes allows his own personal views to take over, and this is reflected in his attacks on Margaret Thatcher, and his glorification of certain types of unemployed layabouts. The film is also, like 2001 better viewed at the cinema. However these criticisms feel a lot like nitpicking, in light of what is actually a truly great film and a fine example of what cinema should be.",This Is England
111,Robert_90,A great spin on gang life,8,24 February 2008,"Stock footage. There's a wide and varied array of sights. Soldiers. Punks. Royalty. War. Explosions. Dying. Death. Thatcher. All of this set to the tune of some catchy reggae.So begins This Is England, Shane Meadows' film about growing up in 1980s England. It presents the life of 12 year old Shaun, a lonely misfit who meets up with a group of skinheads on his way home from school one day. Gradually, Shaun becomes initiated into the gang.At first, the skinheads aren't the stereotypical violent racists that most people imagine skinheads to be. They live and act like any of the other cliques, with a penchant for destructive behaviour. This all changes when former gang leader Combo (Stephen Graham) returns home after three years in prison.This is where the film truly begins. Combo's turn in the joint has changed him. He encourages the gang to follow his new ideal - English pride by way of hate crimes against the recent influx of Pakistani immigrants. His plans cause the gang to splinter into two sections, and it's at this point that Shaun really has to make the choices that matter.I'm not sure how many other people do this (probably a lot), but when I watch a film about a very particular subject matter (in this case, skinheads) I tend to compare it in my mind with other films I've seen with the same subject. It's very easy to watch This Is England and be reminded of, say, American History X or even Romper Stomper. Of course, even though all three films are about skinheads, This Is England is far different in its approach than the latter two.This Is England does ends up demonising the skinhead way of life, it doesn't do it in such a heavy-handed way. Combo first appears by crashing the skinheads' relatively benign party, spouting racist taunts and stories of jail, but later scenes show that he is not just a one-dimensional thug. He has a heart and is genuinely nice at times, which makes his occasional outburst even more shocking (especially the story's climax). It's much more ambiguous, and much more interesting that way.It's a well-made film, no doubt. Meadows pulls good performances out of every player. Stylistically, the film doesn't do anything dramatically over-the-top, which fits the story fine. And of course, I've got to give props to the reggae on the soundtrack. That was a surprising touch for a skinhead movie, but a smart one at that, because that's one of the things that makes This Is England a notch above other skinhead movies  the many ways that it turns the popular myth on its head, and thus manages to turn movies on their head in one bleakly realistic portrayal of life on the fringe.",This Is England

But meeting them is only the beginning of a greater challenge in Shaun's life as through them he meets Combo, a skinhead and an ex-prisoner with an unbounded hatred for racial minorities.As Shaun's joining Woody's gang in the beginning is by mere accident, his friendship with Combo is a conscious decision he makes as he does not want his father's death to be in vain.

It shows the mindless violence but also the supportive side of gang life, the members are all empowered by their asociation with the local gang. Thomas is fatherless, as is the newly self appointed gang leader Stephen Graham. They team up and both get a great deal out of the friendship. The ending was really great, it could have so easily been spoiled by an overdose of sentimentality. In the typical British manner we are left hanging to play out the whole ending in our heads. For me he gives up on the skin head life as he saw that Stephen was in fact not such a well rounded human being after almost murdering his good friend Milk. The kissing scenes between 12 year old Thomas and his ""girlfriend"" of unknown age (guess to be 16),are a little disturbing, but add to the overall realism.",This Is England

Thomas Turgoose is a startlingly good young actor, a real natural; but would the film not have been more believable if he had been a couple of years older? 2.) Were skinheads typically this sensitive and in touch with their emotions? There are too many scenes where they get misty-eyed about the young Turgoose, and throughout the action they are generally more emotionally supportive than you would expect in any group of men - especially in the Thatcherite early 80s, and especially in a group whose main membership card is the outward threat of violence. 3.) Was it not at worst exploitative and at best a slightly cheap move to show horrific Falklands footage at the beginning of the film? There were still some fine performances, and much to recommend a film like this above any number of movies about less serious subjects. I was just surprised that these points seem not to have been mentioned very often in the reviews I've read.",This Is England
115,m-vinteuil,"Good skinheads, bad skinheads",7,16 November 2008,"The serious actor loves to play the racist skinhead. It is the male equivalent of a lesbian role, as it shows their diversity. See Tim Roth stride down the corridor with a swastika tattooed on his forehead in Made in Brittan. See Russell Crowe bulk up to play a similar goon in Romper Stomper. And (to a lesser extent) see Edward Norton try and add some pathos to a fellow with ugly tattoos in American History X. This Is England is unique, in that it offers a factual origin of skinhead culture, and distinguishes between the good (nonracist, offshoot of punks and Rastas in the early '80s) and the bad (racist, National Socialist) skinheads.Shaun is a 12-year-old whom life continually shits upon. Recently having lost his father in the Falklands War, he and his mother have slipped below the poverty line. He receives grief at school for wearing flares, and is shown little sympathy from a Pakistani corner shop owner. After a particularly rough day at school, he bumps in to a group of quite affable 'good' skinheads, who take pity and include him in their activities. Once Shaun is fully inaugurated into their clique, a 'bad' skinhead enters the fray. Combo (someone who seems far too old to be hanging out with teenagers) has just been released from prison, and is seething with bitterness and hatred. He convinces Shaun and half of his 'good' skinhead pals to join the dark side. Shaun, bitter himself at what little life has left him with, takes the National Front role with great gusto. Exacting revenge on the Pakistani clerk whom gave him an earful in act one, and generally enjoying the power trip of pushing around minorities. He also finds a kind of father figure in Combo. And when Combo's bitterness gets the better of him, he loses faith, and as the back of the DVD case attests, learns that ""hate will get you nowhere"". Collective sigh, now on with the faults...From the opening montage of all that is '80s (Atari, Margaret Thatcher) there are far too many gauche attempts to make this a period piece, instead of crafting an unspoken zeitgeist. They might as well have called it ""This is The '80s"", as all the anti-Thatcher graffiti doesn't give the viewer the benefit of the doubt. Made in Brittan had the good fortune to be timely, This is England is all hazy memories.Then there are the mixed messages. Woody, the 'good' skinhead whom first includes Shaun, is genuinely likable, and has an amazing screen presence. He endears himself to Shaun, and to the audience, when he defuses Shaun's mother while she's on an angry tirade. However, when the baton is passed from Woody to Combo, the film shifts from working class empowerment, to bitter and depressing. Woody drops out of the frame completely. And when he is making excuses to leave a party once Combo arrives, I too was with the antagonists in pleading for him to stay. ""No don't leave! This movie will be depressing without you!"". It makes it difficult to fathom that Shaun would prefer the company of Combo to that of Woody, once Woody has been established as such a nice guy. It adds an ugly ""but"" to the text. ""Be proud of who you are, but not too proud"", ""go with the flow, but not if it goes in this direction"". It's too muddled and not concise enough.Shaun also romances a dimwitted girl, nicknamed Smells, who is 4 years older than him, but looks like she's a good 10 years his senior. I know this film is autobiographical, but the coupling of a little boy and a ""well versed"" teenage girl just doesn't look right. There are a few other nameless characters whom seem either far too old, or too young for the context. You would believe it in real life, but strangely, not in a movie.The ending is a spectacular misfire. A film which has traded on gritty realism throughout, suddenly tries its hand at art house symbolism in the final ten minutes. It's attempt to choke you up fails miserably through bad choice of song, and TV movie closeup. From the second act on, it is far too depressing, not warm melancholic, cold depressing. Yes, it portrays the resentment of those who had the misfortune to come of age under Thatcher, but its purpose it far from clear. It captures many moments of the lower middle, to working class lifestyle perfectly. Particularly the shoe shopping scene, which everyone who grew up without family money can relate to. And how a child can gravitate to odd social groups though simple lack of opportunity. It is the lack of concise point which hinders this film from becoming a classic. Maybe we should all stop looking for some moral high ground in skinhead films. Unfortunately for This is England, they went for atonement. A conceit to post-American sensibilities, tacked on to very British experience. Which still leaves the ambiguous Made in Brittan the best of the genre.",This Is England
116,dwolf77,Great Film,8,22 March 2018,"This Is England is a masterly crafted drama. The film manages to balance comedy and a sence of tragedy incredibly well throughout the entire film. The acting is simply brilliant. For a first-time actor, I was blown away by the performance of Thomas Turgoose, who played Sean. Stephen Graham, the actor who played Combo, provided the most effective and dramatic scenes in the film, and was absolutely fantastic. The writing seems incredibly real, and you feel as if you are almost watching a documentary because of how natural the dialogue feels. The cinematography is great, it is well-directed, and the story is captivating. My only criticism would be that the music, on occasion, does some of the thinking for you, and there were just one or two scenes I found to be a little cheesy. Definitely watch this film.

117,oslane,"oi oi oi, a lousy coming of age film",3,11 January 2010,"Why is this movie getting so much praise? It's just another coming of age movie framed by the director's dubious knowledge of a youth cult. It's no different than 'Suburbia' or 'SLC Punk' or I don't know... It's also very pretentious because the back drop is the Falklands war, trying to give the scenario some gravity.But seriously it's no better than a made for TV movie. Its one, single, unique factor is that it portrays skinheads in their original identity - a bunch of fun loving, ganja smoking, reggae listening kids who dressed in those funny Erkle pants and red suspenders - then things get ugly.The events in this movie move along with no real purpose other than to move through a script and throw some heavy scenes in the viewer's face. And what's worse is that the facts are also off. The racist skinheads of 1983 were not just nationalists trying to get Pakistani immigrants out of their country. They were full blown neo-Nazis, in other words the interaction between Combo and Milky, never would happen or at least not in the order the film insists. It's complete rubbish.Furthermore the romance between the kid and the older, goth/glam chick is really weird and creepy. It makes no sense! It's like 'The Tin Drum' only it attempts to be real! It's really gross! In total, I didn't like it. I felt nearly every single moment of this movie was embarrassing and silly. The Falklands war imagery was pointless. And constantly reminding us what decade the movie was set in was annoying - hey another 'Maggie is a c***!' reference, woo!",This Is England
118,ajmelck,If patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel...,9,22 February 2009,"...then This is England puts its finger on the factors that foster malignant nationalism and other social problems.A great film. Vibrant and beautifully made, This is England is a stark reminder of the ragged England of the early 80's, a time which seemed to combine all the worst aspects of capitalism - laissez-faire, militaristic, socially fractured and often just plain ugly. This film throws us in at the deep end of this untempting era, tracing the life of Shaun, a young boy in a northern English town who has to come to terms with his father's death in the Falklands war, his own problems at school, and his mother's benignly neglectful attitude (under a scary 80's perm, she prefers to watch Blockbusters rather than deal with her son's emotional problems). In this grim context, Shaun happens upon and is adopted by a group of skinheads who offer him friendship and self-esteem. While the skins are a slightly rough lot, they are not at this point racists. In fact one of their number, Milky, is black. But as the film progresses, we see how far-right ""England first"" elements come to dominate the scene. And here we reach what is the film's main theme: the insidious slide into racism that marked the skinhead subculture's path through the eighties. As such it's an interesting story, but too much of a cultural footnote to support a whole feature film. But director Shane Meadows manages to take this subject matter and imbue it with a significance beyond its historical context. What is the nature of individual and national identity? How do we constitute our self images, and to what extent is the individual consciousness a product of social, economic and political forces, rather than the precious flame of liberty that some liberals would like to believe in?All these questions are raised, displayed and rotated before us in a compelling and ambivalent way. Anyone who moans about today's obsession with labels and brands should take a look at this film as a reminder that this kind of thing was already happening back then. The film's look is rough and ready, an unsentimental representation in a rawly realistic mode. The one thing the had me a little confused was the geography. The characters all talk in Northern accents, but where we are is somehow indeterminate as West Yorkshire, Scouse and east coast accents mingle. Not a big criticism, but the only one I could find in this otherwise remarkable film.",This Is England

This proves you don't need big actors or big money to make a great film and maybe the people in Hollywood could take a hint from this. This Is England is about a 12 year old boy Shaun, who lives in england in the 1980's during the war in the Faulklands and after his dad dies in the war he is ridiculed. He befriends a group of skinheads and after a bit of fun a hardcore skinhead by the name of Combo (Stephen Graham from Snatch) comes and tests the groups morals.This is a emotional, entertaining and at times very amusing film. The script and acting in this film are extraordinary and the brilliant 80's background and music set a great atmosphere.There are only a few films i consider perfect (Requiem for a Dream, Shawshank and Garden State) and this one would be definitely up there as one of the movies which must be seen, definitely recommended 11/10",This Is England

121,matthewwalker50,"A shocking, and Intense Film About British Racism In the Early 80's",7,26 June 2012,"This Is England is a genuinely shocking 97 minute and 20 seconds emotional roller-coaster that gets more & more intense as the film progresses. Set in 1983. (The Margaret Thatcher years) A young, troubled boy is filled with bitterness and rage from the horrific death of his father in the 1982 Falklands War, and wants to, in his own words, make his dad proud. The film is briefly based on the tragedy of the Falklands War, Skinheads in the early 80's, racism, & masculinity. Shaun, is seen early in the film at school feeling lonely & sad, without any friends on a school playground, when he is harassed by a bully named Harvey. Harvey, who knows what happened to Shauns dad at the Falklands, makes some very cruel, insulting remarks about his father. He makes a horrible joke about ""How many ppl can u fit in a Mini?"" He replies to Shaun saying 2 in the back, 2 in the front, and his dad in the ashtray. Shaun snaps, attacks him. Both fight and curse, until being separated and punished by their headmaster. Shaun bumps into a man named Woody in a tunnel, who feels bad for Shaun. Tries to help him, but the gang insult him with flare comments. Shaun runs off, the gang apologise and recruit Shaun as their new member. Shaun is seen later on dating a much bigger girl than him while he is still a young boy. Everything gets nasty when Combo turns up. Played by Stephen Graham, Combo's character is extremely intense. Filled with bitter and sieving rage. He was just released from prison, and gets back to his old violent ways with the gang. Threatening Pakistani's on the street racially and violently, jumping out of a car in a volatile fit of uncontrollable rage, whipping out machete's and nearly stabbing a helpless shopkeeper, and in the end nearly killing his Jamaican friend Milky with an excruciating beating with hard kicks and punches, smashing a glass bottle on his mates face, leaving Shaun in tears & despair. The closing credits show actual clips I believe from the war. The movie contains around 273 F-Bombs, about 70 racial slurs, and all of their derivatives. Not for the faint of heart!!

You don't have to be curious about England or the Falkland War to appreciate this flick.Shane Meadows (writer/director) draws on personal experience to bring this film to life. A young Thomas Turgoose does an incredible job of playing Shaun and making the viewer care and worry about his every move. Stephen Graham (Combo) can almost get you to sign up for the cause when he pleads his case. But, some take the (cause) too far and lose sight of real friendship.Great acting combines with a (perceived) good vs. evil and a non ""Hollywood"" chain of events.

But 'This is England' is far from a turgid and banal teaching or preaching of racial morality. For all movies tough guy exterior it is held together by softest core you could ever imagine.'This is England' is driven by representations of early 80's angst and confusion surrounding the Falklands War and Thatcher's Britain, exploring the disorientated youth culture of working class England in a time of high unemployment and political uprising. We follow the progress of the films protagonist Shaun (Thomas Turgoose), who has lost his father to the Falklands war, is struggling with Bullying at school and looking for acceptance and friendship. He finds what he is looking for through a group of peaceful fun loving Skin Head's led by the charming and charismatic Woody (Joseph Gilgun) who integrates Shaun into the gang. Things turn sour however through the arrival Stephen Graham's psychotic portrayal of Combo, a violent neo-Nazi who is hell-bent on disrupting the harmony and brotherhood the group share in order to stir up racial tension in the local area.However as mentioned earlier this film is an exploration of 80's youth culture along with male interaction and bonding, we are treated to scenes of sheer brilliance and emotional connection between the characters, whilst some scenes explode with melodrama, sadness and violence. Shane Meadows has delivered a masterpiece to rival any British film of the last 20 years; the cinematography, character development, costume and structure of the movie all exhort superlatives. What I like most about this effort is feeling that anybody (regardless if you were a skin head or not) could relate this movie to their own youth and up bringing from the getting that hair cut or tattoo that you knew your mother would disapprove of, getting into fights at school, to that first awkward kiss or intimate moment with a girl. This is a movie that almost makes you resent your 9-5 orientated, mortgage driven, pressure cooker of a life. Simply because it makes being young and free seem so much fun and reminds you of the days you used to hang around with your contemporaries at the local recreational fields doing not very much when you should have been doing your homework or helping your mother out with the household chores. In closing all I can say is watch this movie especially if you grew up in the 80's, this is one of the rare movies that will make you question not only your own thoughts and ideologies, but also all the things your have done in the past and all the things you will do in the future.",This Is England
124,IanPhillips,Shane Meadows' best film to date,10,4 July 2015,"This Is England is most definitely one of the very best British films of the twenty-first century, and for me ranks as Shane Meadows most outstanding to date. Meadows draws on his own personal experiences as a skinhead during the early 1980's. This Is England is set during the summer months of 1983 at the time of ""Thatcher's Britain"" and indeed the era of the skinheads, punk, racism and fascism.Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is a lonely 11 year old kid growing up on a rough council estate in the North Of England. He is grieving the sudden loss of his father after he was killed in the horrific Falklands War. Encountering incessant bullying at school, Shaun meets a gang of friendly, multi-cultural, dope-smoking skinheads, headed by Woody (Joseph Gilgunn) who immediately are drawn to his sadness and confusion and subsequently take the boy under their wing. However when one of the gang's old members Combo, (Stephen Graham) a vicious, racist thug and bully, is released from prison, Shaun is manipulated by Combo's way of thinking and racist attitude and turns into a thug himself, convinced he would be making his late Dad proud. After Combo brutally beats up Shaun's friend Milky (Andrew Shim) and exposes his own deep vulnerability and unbalanced mental state, Shaun comes back down to earth (and his senses), realising the lifestyle he'd been leading was not really for him, nor would it have made his Dad proud.Though the first half of This Is England is touchingly funny, drawing on the allure and fun of being in a gang, the second half soon makes way for a much darker, raw and gritty nature, with many violent episodes, highlighting the brutally stark racism that existed at the time (and still does unfortunately!. Shane Meadows shrewdly evokes the total working-class despair of ""Thatcher's Britain"", capturing the era impeccably well and is all impressively authentic in detail.Like every other of Shane Meadows absolutely superb films, the acting and dialogue is astutely naturalistic, drawing you in from the opening scene. Most outstanding of all is the immensely talented youngster Thomas Turgoose who's almost stark performance never once shrinks from being anything but powerful and convincing. Indeed the cast are all thoroughly excellent that includes another notably powerful turn from the ever-brilliant Stephen Graham as Combo; Joseph Gilgunn as the lovable, kindly rogue Woody who is the leader of the gang that Shaun first joins and who also refuses to be brainwashed by Combo's unhinged way of thinking and racial hatred; Jo Hartley as Shaun's mum Cynth who upon meeting the gang headed by Woody becomes charmed by them , after having had serious reservations when first seeing her young son with a shaved head; Andrew Shim as the friendly Milky; Vicky McClure as the more sensible, level-headed Lol and Rosamund Hanson as the eccentric but likable Smell.Truly an out and out masterpiece, This Is England is an often funny, often shocking and often deeply moving portrait of a moment in British cultural history.Ian Phillips",This Is England
125,imdb-5596,Eerily real 1980s England setting for the road to neo-Nazism,8,22 June 2008,"I like this film because it works in two ways. Neither, though, were what I expected based on trailers - this is not a cheeky piece of reminiscence about naughty kids and 80s music. It's dark, serious and a bit gruelling at times.The first win for this film, which 100+ other reviewers have praised here, is its strikingly realistic portrayal of England in the early 80s. I actually had to double-check the production year. It's not just the props - though they are highly effective - the corner shop and so on. It captures the tension of Thatcher's England that so many of us are keen to forget. It wasn't all clothes and hair and estate agents driving Porches round Surrey. These were tough times for the majority, and This Is England brilliantly captures an anonymous council estate somewhere north of Oxford. It sets itself apart from other excellent period films like ""Kes"" and ""Rita, Sue and Bob Too"" by adopting less local stereotypes, retaining relevance to the whole top half of the country.The second (and darker) win is the story of how hardship and division in society have formed a natural lure to be exploited by the articulate proponents of nationalism and racism. The film brilliantly explores the huge grey area on the fringes of prejudice. Combo divides Woody's gang with his ""this is England"" speech - demonstrating the orator's skill to twist division and resentment (Milky's ethnic origin, Thatcher, the Falklands War, and then on the spot turning the latter point on its head to win Shaun's support); the National Front rally divides the gang again; Milky's return irks banjo and then ultimately divides Combo's own mind, resulting in the awful finale. The mirror image of Hitler's persuasive approach and its ready applicability to England in times of hardship is the terrifying message I came away with.Great stuff. Also full off excellent, convincing, low-key characters - though I didn't quite believe in Woody or Smell - Shaun and Combo are stand out both on performance and script.",This Is England
126,Yukster_uk,powerful film,9,7 May 2007,"Brilliant story, brilliant acting, funny, frightening and sad. So many films, you see Pele get shot or blown up all the time and it means nothing. In this film, the violence feels horrible, like you're being attacked. NOt everyone knows skinheads, but people will recognise characters from this film- growing up, wanting to fit in with older kids, trying to be cool, the posing aggressive sorts. Shane Meadows is a class director. Conflicted violent/ vulnerable characters are always interesting to watch, but in Woody they created a nice-guy type who is also compelling in his own way. One thing I didn't understand was this guy in their gang who was about 40 and seemed to tag along without anyone questioning.",This Is England

128,JessyCritical,Highly believable,7,12 November 2010,"""We are not racist..we are realist"" is one of the most powerful lines This Is England has and sums up the excuse many people used during 1980's England. The excuse to physically and verbally abuse people because of the colour of their skin.; or if they just didn't fit in with the crowd. You can't help but be lured in to 12 year-old Shaun's heart-felt story. Set in the 1983 Midlands, he is bullied because his trousers are too baggy, something that could probably happen in a school today. On his way home he meets a gang of skinheads, lead by Woody; one of the few characters with a handful of morals. He consoles Shaun and immediately involves him in his gang. The impressionable Shaun, eager to fit in somewhere, adjusts his image and asks, ""Am I in the gang now?"" Despite being younger than the majority of the skinheads, Shaun is accepted; showing how important appearances can be in this film. The first appearance of the Irish, recently-out-of-prison Combo, is a memorable one. Dying to impress everyone he enthusiastically tells a story involving a thieving black man he met in prison. Ignoring his nonchalant audience, he throws around many racist terms, seeming not to have noticed the only black skinhead in the room, Milky. The clever use of piano music creates a very questioning tone, is this how society will always be? Shane Meadows successfully pin-points what was wrong with England in the 1980's and encourages the audience to make sure this doesn't happen again. When the group is split and Shaun chooses the Nationalist Combo over Woody, we know he has made the wrong decision and we intently follow the rest of the film to see what becomes of his choice. This Is England covers many themes; romance, violence, friendship and family in its 90 minutes, so we remain fully engrossed to its end. The many questions Meadows raises are enough for this film to remain in the audience's head for a long time after they watch it. Including clips from the '80's and alluring music, we know that this film was not put together over night, a lot of thought was needed to get it to this standard. The characters are believable, the script fantastically written, with brilliant performances to deliver it. The 18 certificate is needed, however, many would agree that the story should be seen by those younger. Showing the importance of the family unit, and the lengths young people will go to be accepted, This Is England was destined to be a modern-day classic and one of the best films of 2006.",This Is England
129,garethwatkin,"""Harvey? What kind of a girly name is Harvey?""",9,28 February 2009,"""It's a bloody good film"" says Louis, a friend of mine over for a day of random 'Get-together, have-a-laugh, read-my-lyrics and watch-films' kind of day. Choice was to either watch This Is England, or Cube.2: Hypercube. And it is not a difficult task to guess which film won in our random game of selection.This was the second time i had watched this film, but during my first viewing, i had a lot of stopping and starting, and missed out a few key sequences. Therefore my entire opinion of the film was lacking a certain sense of validity, considering that i didn't know... 'exactly' what i was reviewing. However, having watched it for a second time, i am now able to do my review, which means divulging away from these paragraphs of non-sensical ramblings of the actual watching, and more comprehensible talking of the movie itself.For starters, criticism's, getting them out of the way first as is my new habit in writing terrible reviews where i have the highly prominent quirk of going off on a tangent (As done now). My first criticism goes to the concept of Smelly's character, as i find the whole idea of a 16-year old girl kissing and dating an 11-year old kind of odd... However, i never grew up in 80's Britian. Hell, i never even grew up in 80's Ireland (My beloved homeland). So perhaps my ignorance of growing up during these times makes me susceptible to finding fault within these types of relationships, as for all i know, there could have been many 16-year old girls dating 11-year old boys. Who knows? Perhaps my main problem with Smelly was that she reminded me too much of mine and my friend's own personal Scary Mary. (""Damn Right!"" he says, taking a swig of Stella Artois). Less on that subject though, as personal Scary Marys are never a pretty subject to talk about, no matter what context it is placed within. To be honest, there is little criticism i can place upon this film. To start with my praising, and immediately diving into talking about the acting... The acting within this film stunned me. I can easily see why Thomas Turgoose has had so much praise for his performance in this film, as it is bloody fantastic! He shows such emotion, and childish attitudes towards simple things (""I want those ones!"" he says, pointing to a large pair of red shoes) It is difficult though to point out any bad performances. Mediocre, yes, a fair few performances of 'that' calibre, but there was some outstanding performances. Moving swiftly on to Direction & Writing. Shane Meadows has astounded me once, and i am highly interested in seeing more of his films. The advert on my DVD for his other independent film Dead Man's Shoes looked very interesting, and i plan to view a lot more of his films. There is little to say on the subject of direction, as for what the film is, it was perfect. Shane Meadow's writing was also outstanding. His script was preformed to amazing standard, and shows very little signs of fault. Meadows presents exactly how good scripts can be written, and then presented exceptionally. The cinematography and editing within this film were also exceptional. In specific sequences, which some people may know to which i am referring too. In some sequences, the rapid cinematography shaking around the room, and the rapid editing, showing extreme closeups of different images create such power and hard-hitting images, it is impossible to look at, and impossible to turn away from. Linked from my last point, the soundtrack was perfectly chosen, using choice music composed by one of my favourite pianists (Who i was into long before seeing this film) Ludovico Einaudi. His melodic moving piano pieces matched perfectly the mood and tempo of the specific sequences it was applied too. Other songs from the 80's itself helped to create the 80's feel of the movie, and all in all, it is an exceptional soundtrack.In my tediously-arrived conclusion, there are little faults within this film. I give this film a 9 out of 10, as it is an exceptional film. Perfect? No, i do not give 10 out of 10 ratings to any films i have seen, but this, easily becomes one of the best films, i have ever seen.",This Is England

In ""This is England"" we do see some redemption. Why hasn't a Hollywood studio mogul kidnapped Shane Meadows and Mike Leigh and gave them a blank cheque and a year or two to give them a blockbuster. This is unlikely but possible. At present ""Dead Man's Shoes"" is Shane's best work. Along with his long time friend and co-band member of ""She Talks To Angels""(inspired by the Black Crowes track of the same name) Paddy Considine and Paul Fraser,they put together the masterpiece that is ""Dead Man's Shoes"". The Bourne Ultimatum will hopefully put Paddy onto the Hollywood A list. If Hollywood doesn't grab him I will still wait in high anticipation for his next film.",This Is England
134,blamb147,the realistic politics of youth,9,17 January 2010,"This movie is realistic, emotionally-gripping, and very historically informative about a period of culture and politics in the UK in the 1980s. There is a constant back-and-forth between the characters and the larger world-historical events that are conditioning their lives (Thatcherite neoliberalism, the war over the Faulkan islands, the rise of the Nationalist movie, the increasing panic over immigration and how it affects a nation's nostalgic collective identity). I have never been so impressed by so a young actor (Thomas who plays Shaun): his experiences and emotions are so real that the audience partakes in them (plus, unlike Combo, he still can cry shame-free).I just put up a review for Inglourious Basterds and I can help but compare these two very different movies according the rubric I developed there: with Tarantino, the aesthetics outweights (or eliminates) the thematics, or any larger universal moral content. With Shane Meadows it is almost the diametric opposite: the moral reflection of the 10-year old boy (about racism, friends, and nationalism) is more sophisticated than Tarantino's whole ensemble. I say ""almost"" the opposite, because Meadows obviously had his own carefully crafted cinematic aesthetics, which others probably called 'realism.' So This Is England is still a very aesthetic movie, in a realistic sense, but as a polar opposite of the bravado-fantastic aesthetics of Basterds. They are two genres and obviously both have some merits, but Meadow's choice of realism certainly encourages moral reflections on the effects of violence much better than Tarantino.",This Is England
135,benjamin-twist,Well made but ultimately confused...,7,4 June 2008,"This film is well photographed, brilliantly cast and impressively acted. There's a lot of attention to detail with the clothes, cars, music, etc, evoking the early 1980s beautifully. However the whole skinhead cult had more-or-less died by 1983 (even in the North where this is set) and the only real boots-and-braces skins around then were either in extreme factions of the NF or were gay skins on the gay scene.Also the film's central theme is wooly to say in the least. This probably has a lot to do with the fact that the writer (Shane Meadows) has combined parts of his own story with the cast's own real life stories and other elements but this has made plot nonsensical. As it is Meadows is poking a finger at racists and thugs by saying that they are a bunch of misfits. This is perhaps best displayed by the shot of Combo's gang walking through town shown in slow motion with no two of them looking the same. Young Sean feels he is an outsider and so joins the gang to become someone (like Jimmy in Quadrophenia) but is forced to confront the gang's racism. However scenes of Combo and his 'gang' terrorising local Asians and spouting off about patriotism, as well as attending an NF meeting, are clichéd to say in the least and here the film looses its way. I get the impression that Meadows wanted to set the film earlier in 1980/81 when the whole skin/NF thing would make sense but has been forced to set it in 1983 to put it after the Falklands conflict. This is so Sean's dad can be a casualty of the war which gives Sean a sense of loss, a reason to be an outsider and a reason to join the gang. This brings up one of the film's (proposed) themes which is about patriotism. However this theme is confused because, far from criticising the troops in the Falklands, National Front skinheads embraced it because they were standing up for England. However this theme is seemingly dropped about two thirds of the way through the film and so when it ends with the shots of the Falklands war it becomes meaningless. Why not drop the patriotism theme and set the film in 1980 when the skinhead thing would make sense (a lot of kids got into the Two Tone/Ska thing at that time and as a result the NF did try to recruit a lot of them), then everything else might fall into place.Parts of the film do work and are charming, almost funny (eg the scene where Sean wants his mum to buy him a pair of DM boots) but there are some bizarre elements which must be addressed: The idea that Smell, who is supposed to be about 17/18, would be happy to have Sean as her boyfriend when he's only 12 (and is about half her size) is frankly ridiculous. If it were done purely for comic relief it might just work but the fact that the characters have an intense discussion about the relationship means it is supposed to be deadly serious. Combo is supposed to 32. Even back in the early 80s if a 32 year old guy hung around with teenagers people would think he was either retarded or a pervert. But he and his even older mate (who looks like a gay leather clone or a roadie for ZZ Top) mix with the kids as though it were normal. This is not normal, it is bizarre. The scene where Combo confronts Lol about their 'relationship' and presents her with a gift he made for her in prison is equally bizarre. Violent, racist thugs just don't do this sort of thing. But the oddest part is the ending where Combo beats up the black guy Milky. It has been suggested elsewhere that this is because Combo is himself mixed race (like Milky) but he is insanely jealous of Milky's life and so goes for him. This would be barely credible if it were actually addressed in the film but the writer has omitted to make any of this clear, thus making the whole scene confusing and rather ugly. It would have been so much better to see a film about skinheads and their lives without making it a film about racism and violence but I guess that's never going to happen. But if you're going to try and do something different then DO something different. Don't do what the creators of This Is England have done and combine shock tactics with embarrassingly cliché after cliché. It just doesn't work.",This Is England
136,funkydoodycool,beautiful,8,8 August 2015,"My favourite British film. Sure, at times the acting is clunky (particularly amongst the child actors - who without exception improve in the TV sequels) but the ambiance, the setting are pure nostalgic genius. The story hits home as a true part of Thatcher's legacy, with Stephen Graham's Combo bringing amazing insight and emotional power to his character, who is caught up in anti-Pakistani sentiment of the time. Thomas Turgoose's acting is also worthy of note - unfortunately he has since failed to live up to his career's beginnings, however here he takes us with him as he struggles to find his place amongst the other characters in the story. The real shame is that Joe Gilgun doesn't have more screen time. His character, Woody, provides the perfect foil to Combo, but it isn't a relationship that is explored in any depth until the sequels. The relationship between Smell (a 15 year old girl) and Shawn (an 11 year old boy) has drawn some criticism, but that stuff happened, and probably still happens today. It was presented in a wholly realistic, if awkwardly acted, manner. As a political allegory it serves to remind us that once upon a time, not all that long ago, our perceived ""enemies"" were different to those today. Replacing anger towards ""pakis"" today with Eastern Europeans and Muslims. Shane Meadows has stated that the story unfolds as a reflection of his own childhood. This comes across in the film, which reminds me also of the dark times in my childhood in that period. I knew people like those depicted in the film, both those that embraced the racist rhetoric of the National Front, and those who saw past it and stayed out of the nonsense. Besides this, the clothing, the poor decoration in the homes, and the struggles of Shawn's mother against poverty are all spot on for the time.Additionally this film has one of the greatest, and most fitting soundtracks ever. Apparently a couple of the popular songs were not actually released until a year after the film's setting, but regardless, the collection of songs evokes well the spirit of the early 80s. The piano and guitar instrumentals beautifully carry the emotion of certain scenes.",This Is England

Some bits could have been improved but overall i thought it was a very good film, brilliantly acted. At some points you had to grit your teeth and watch some horrible bits in the film, it made me cry at the end. It's about a boy who's being bullied at school and passes by some skinheads and he becomes part of their gang, and then the tables are turned as an old friend comes out of prison and the some of them go with him. it's definitely worth watching, a very good film.

140,Rozzi1,Excellent social drama. Highly recommended,9,18 September 2015,"Set in a small northern town in 1983 the story follows Shaun, a 13 year old loner who falls in with the local gang of Skinheads, led by warm-hearted Woody. Aside from the unrealistic anti-Falklands sentiment among some of the characters, namely Combo (I don't recall anyone back in 1982 being against the war – except a few Labour MPs – and only several regiments of professional soldiers went to the Falklands not droves of conscripts as the film implies, also it was over in 3 months so had long finished before the film's time line begins) aside from that, the film is brilliant and perfectly captures the essence of youth, disaffected youth, group bonding, and growing up in the early 80s, devoid of any typical TV drama nostalgia getting in the way. It's gritty and realistic in the best form, and director Shane Meadows manages beautifully to inter-lace this with several stylised moments without spoiling the overall tone of social-realism.Loner as Shaun may be, he is also full of courage and spirit beyond his years, and quickly becomes a popular member of the varied bunch of Skins. But when Combo, a much older Skinhead and a violent, psychotic, racist, returns to the town after a 3 year prison term, everything changes for Woody, Shaun and the group. Dividing the gang on racial and political lines, half of the lads and lassies stick to their morals and remain with Woody – while the rest, including Shaun, join Combo and a his racist sidekick Banjo.The complexities of Shaun's decision to join the racist faction of the town's Skinhead scene, is probably be best explained as a post-traumatic reaction to the loss of his father. Having been a soldier, Shaun's father is killed in action during the Falklands war, and so as the film begins so too does Shaun's grief and suffering as he struggles to make sense of the world. Combo and his faction offer Shaun a tougher, more male orientated existence and one which thrives on acts of aggression and violence. It is this environment and behaviour which Shaun needs to help him cope with the grief and the absence of a strong paternal figure. As the story reaches its climax, Shaun reaches his own conclusion about the life around him.An excellent, well written, brilliantly directed and acted, social drama. Highly recommended.",This Is England

However after watching the business I lost a bit of interest. Then I heard about This is England, not Nick Love, but a similar story, with Tommy the Tit (Stephen Graham).The film summed up all the feelings of the eighties, but also showed the changing feelings through a confused twelve year old boy.I think it wanted to show the world through how Maggie ran the country but at the same time show that people tried to change things.The worst(or best) thing about the film is that made in 2006 that in 2008 when I write this not a lot has changed, the attitude of people towards different races and immigration, (I accept its too much) is just out of the peoples hands. This is an 80's emotional rollercoster, a great film that can contrast to today's society.If your English it will show you a new or maybe even an unexpected side, If your not it will give you a brief show of England, not in the 80's but in the 21st century!",This Is England

How many times have you watched a movie where the characters are monologuing every 2 minutes and using these massive words and you think to yourself: ""Nobody talks like that"" This movie does not have that issue. That's what I mean when I say the characters did not feel like characters. The film also humanizes the bad and makes you question some of the good guys habits and choices. It understands that the world is not black and white and that people are more than good or bad. The soundtrack and score was also great but I did feel like it was overused and manipulative at points. All the performances are great especially Stephen graham and even the child actor is great.

It explores some very controversial issues and the acting was superb. The main character is played by Thomas Gurgoose, and this film is dedicated to his mother who died in 2005.

147,josevcutts,"Up there, but a big let down",3,1 June 2007,"Anyone who grew up working class in the early eighties is gonna get right behind Shane Meadows' latest piece, and I found myself whipped back to a time of skineads, unemployment, despondency at our futures, and a general disenfranchised feeling of self worthlessness as experienced by us, the impoverished masses, spearheaded by what was a true tory government - not our current lying tory government, hiding behind a name that used to represent us - but a real tory government that was never afraid to say they hated, yes HATED, us, the working class. You can hate her, but at least she told us that.With that I loved the idea of This Is England and preminisced a story of wasted and misguided youth, but with an ultimate redemtion in the understanding of why we'd been lied to and told by so many that it was those of colour who would ultimately lead to us being unemployed when we were of age. Or at the very least this could've been a film that reminded us how this modern government, claiming to be representative of the working class, was indeed none other than a Margeret Thatcher Paradigm. Sadly, although This Is England very much captures a time and place, it provides no lessons or explanations for the reasons why we were lead to think that way, all those years ago in the eighties. There's nothing here but a story, and if you're going to throw in footage of real events, then juxtaposion it against the trials and tribulations of something so real as that time, then at least do it with a point!It's many years since I blamed the failings of society on race, or sat in on speeches given by Oxbridge educated men who believed in repatriation, and I was hoping to see a little of that growth in This Is England. Unfortunately it isn't there. There's nothing that decries racism - or even the current insanity of liberalism that floods the country with the things we'd been told to fear back then when it wasn't even real! There's no reaffirmations of what we should've learnt from those times. There's nothing to suggest the stupidy of both sides of the political spectrum - the conservatives or conversersly the ultra right wing.Instead this is just a film about a kid who gets involved in some drama involving skinheads. In defence, the acting and direction is excellent - up there with Ken Loach for realism, and lovable for being so completely English, but a million miles away from Alan Clarke and David Leland for what we can learn - it just isn't what I'd hoped for in way of a bigger picture. Maybe I'm the moron for not being able to see it for what it is: tantamount to a good episode of Eastenders, but sadly, nothing more. If you ever see Shane Meadow's give an interview, he's a really interesting character - you'd definitely expect more than this.",This Is England
148,just_hamish,This is England - The very best British cinema has to offer.,10,5 November 2006,"Fellow Midlander Shane Meadows has produced not only his finest work to date but one of the very best films to come out of Britain that I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Just as the effectively chilling, bloody (yet arguably flawed) ""Dead Man's Shoes"" showcased a passionate return to low budget, focused film making, ""This Is England"" sees him perfect his technique. It is a seemingly effortless achievement that matches a warm, humorous portrayal of a young lad growing up with his experience of the cold brutality that came with the 80s skinhead culture. The way in which Shane blends these two aspects together without compromising on either is most impressive.Delivering a surprising, enchanting performance in the lead role as Shaun, Thomas Turgoose portrays a youngster of incredible warmth and charisma. He is befriended by a relatively harmless gang skirting with the skinhead culture rife at the time. His strength of character in the face of the adversity life throws his way is truly unforgettable, a credit to both Shane as the writer and Thomas as the performer. As Shaun discovers the joy of ""belonging"" in the gang, the viewer takes a similar journey. Through sublime use of another excellent soundtrack (an ear for music in relation to visuals is one of Shane's most loved and respected trademarks) the joy of youth and life literally springs from the screen.What is particularly successful is Shane's restraint where it comes to grounding the film in reality. It would have been all too easy to escalate these events above and beyond the core group of characters, creating a power struggle on a much bigger, thrill friendly scale. Instead the film remains focused and convincing, not once do you doubt the likelihood of events. The canvas may be smaller but emotionally ""This Is England"" resonates more powerfully than ever before, taking the harsh, greys of a story like ""Dead Man's Shoes"" and enlightening it with a central character full of warmth and honesty. In the end this serves to engage the viewer on a much greater level.It is in comedy that ""This Is England"" truly surprises, not the usual splash of dark humour but humour of much broader appeal. Thomas' performance brings the sharp dialogue to life with a wonderful physical range, the first half the film is crammed with delightful comic moments that really draw you in to the character, making future events all the more affecting. Much is made of Shaun's romance with a much older girl, the scenes are tear-jerking in their tender, wonderfully observed realism. There is much in the film that will trigger moments of recognition in the viewer, especially (but not exclusively) those who were young in the 80s.As big time skinhead Combo (the other stand out performance of the piece from Scouser Stephen Graham) comes out of jail the film takes a U-Turn, presenting a troubling, unrestrained view on racism through extreme nationalism, getting deep under the skin to question the source and nature of such hatred. It is in this that we realise this is a study of human nature as Shaun is presented with more extreme acts that drive him to question the moral behind such irrational prejudices.Book ending the film is real news footage of the political climate surrounding the events depicted, prominent among which is Maggie Thatcher's invasion of the Falklands (a conflict that's consequences prove key to the central narrative) When asked ""Will we ever talk to the Argentines again?"" on a radio interview Thatcher purrs ""No I don't think so"" The parallels are fitting and thoroughly engaging. Inspired, shaped and formed by Shane's own childhood, ""This Is England"" is ultimately an honest, confident piece of film making right from the heart. The film is a wonderful example of what British cinema has to offer the world. The film may be grounded in period authenticity, but the narrative is ultimately applicable to all of us, having experienced the inescapable process of growing up. Shaun's quality shines through, his experienced may be unique but the messages conveyed are most certainly universal.",This Is England

One, to truthfully and simply share his own story in such a true, beautiful manner. And second, for creating a movie which limpidly, perfectly depicts the nakedness and futility of hatred.Obviously, one would have drawn parallels with American History X, especially in the scene when Combo delivers his rhetoric. But what makes this movie different and so very special is the view point of the boy Shaun, portrayed with an almost uncanny genius by Thomas. It forces you to ask several questions, look into the small incidents in the movie at multiple levels. For e.g. isn't the motivation for Gadget to join Combo more childish than any other motivation in the entire movie? The movie portrays brilliantly, the difference between a boy and a man. We are all men most of the times, except when we become tiny little boys with stupid little narrow minds, accepting hypocrisy and hatred as a way of life, to sate a battered ego. The culmination of this stupidity is sadly splendid, the smirk on Milky's face just before he is done to death! And at the end, a real man still stands tall, looking into our eyes, after he discards his racist nationalist tendencies and the Flag which represented it.A moving, true, gritty story, told simply and perfectly, driving home a simple message which some of us tend to continually ignore.

Despite Shaun's iconic end actions the film doesn't bring out a positivity of overcoming the harsh period in his life I felt it would have benefit from having.This is England was one of the most enjoyable films I've witnessed for quite a while but with a little more originality and ambition during the second half it could have been a classic.Maybe next time Meadows.",This Is England

I don't remember skinheads that well when the Falklands was on,but i do remember being in primary school and seeing graffiti that said National Front = Nazi front and something about the union jack being a Nazi flag. Thats the bit that irritated me at the end,although it was true. For at least 20 years it was frowned upon the have a union jack unless you was a racist and i never hardly seen a st George cross until England never won the world cup again in the last few years. I'm glad to see that the flag of England and The UK is finally being accepted ,but i get the impression the fascist left(guardianistas?) will never get used to it.

Both have their pros and cons. The young kid in the film finally gets accepted with the older kids and what seems like a change for the better in his worldview can also be a change for the worse - time to grow and see what the world is really about and it's not all unicorns and rainbows.

Lame story, bad acting, the Skinhead characters came across as total W4nkers that you wouldn't want to know in real life. Overall the movie is a dud, not recommended. The scene where the 12 year old hero has a French Kissing festival with the 18 year old ""Smell"" I found very indecent. I found the social topic about racism within the Skinhead subculture to be a yawn. I cannot for the life of me understand that a movie, which trumpets itself as what England was like in 1983, failed to even mention the Irish Republican Armys Rampage in Englands cities at that time! From what I remember everyone in Britain bemoaned the IRA's campaign of terror, including this subject would of made a much better movie.

162,shadedgrenade,A well crafted masterpiece,10,4 July 2008,"Set in the beginning of 80s when tight bright clothing was a given, hair styles often rivaled that of a Wookie's and England was suffering under the rule of then Prime Minister, the Iron Lady ""Thatcher"", we are given front row seats to the story of 11 year old misfit, Shaun (Thomas Turgoose). Having recently experienced the loss of his father we explore his change from a young, mournful social outcast to an anger driven thug who is embraced by a group of local skin-heads.Having dealt with social ridicule and bullying on a regular basis Shaun quickly embraces the acceptance given to him by his new found friends. However things do not remain as they are, as the once joyous, fun-loving and carefree group is divided by the return of Combo (Steven Graham, Gangs of New York, Snatch), an old gang member who represents the more commonly recognized pro-Nazi Skinheads. From this point the film takes a U-turn and begins exploring the harsh realities surrounding racism through extreme nationalism all through the eyes of an 11year old craving acceptance.Shane Meadow's has truly crafted a wonderful masterpiece, bringing together an all too familiar picture of racism and hatred but on a more recognizable level than that of other racially based story lines such as those covering American prejudice towards Muslims and Arabs in general. ""This is England"" explores the reasons why and how racism and hate on such extreme levels is ever reached by clearly painting an all round view from both sides of the fence. Even though this is a period piece set in the UK and may not be all that familiar to those out of the UK, the messages it delivers are universal and should be taken in by all.Through a combination of gritty visuals, a feeling of great realism and astounding performances all round, especially those of new comer Thomas Turgoose and British actor Stephen Graham, ""This is England"" leaves the viewer truly overwhelmed by its well crafted story.",This Is England
163,ILiveInTheMarbles,One of the best European films in the last decade,10,9 June 2009,"For real, that movie is the definition of good cinema. You just can't ask for more. Take the soundtrack for instance, isn't just a collection of good tunes, it's a vital part of the plot and generally the movie, it's one of the magic ingredients if you want. For example, the first song by Toots and The Maytals introduce you to the main theme, the concept. It makes you think about the title or the summary you read at the back of the DVD. What am I watching? A political film? A comedy? A drama? Is it really about England? What is it all about? Well it's a drama but it almost covers every genre.The main theme is about the skinhead subculture at the 80's. The director portrays masterfully the transient period between the early stylistic movement of skinheads and the adaptation by white nationalist groups. The atmosphere in the film is incredibly intense, but basically it is magical, because everything have been arranged in perfect harmony in order to convince you that the movie has actually filmed at the 80's! You simply can't get away from the action, the characters grabs you and make you a part of their hard situations.The plot focuses on a lonely young boy who meets a group of skinheads and has a great time hanging around with them and finally he's being part of it. All goes wonderfully well for him until a friend of gang's leader returns from jail full of ideas. Stephen Graham, as a passionate nationalist delivers that role outstandingly (man, he is one of the reasons I find academy awards a phoney business) and along with Thomas Turgoose, they make one of the most wonderful to watch duo in cinema history. You are a witness of his troubled past without even hear him talk about it. You just watch his facial expressions and desperate looks and you been drifted away to his childhood years. He truly delivers a mesmerising performance in this film, and he's one of the most interesting characters I've seen in English cinema. Thomas Turgoose does an equally impressive job and I guarantee you that he will left you speechless when you will see this little young actor (it's his first movie!!!) evokes such feelings on the screen that can make Hollywood idols look like amateurs. But generally, this film's grandiose potential depends hugely on its actors performances. And it's absolutely succeed beyond ANY expectations. Because you see, you can find incredible depth on these complex characters. You have to watch it few times to gasp what the director intended to convey. I really believe that this movie is one of the best, English cinema could ever have hoped to produce. It is exactly what good cinema is all about, it has it all.",This Is England

I really liked Dead Man's Shoes but feel apart from that, Shane Meadows' talent is vastly exaggerated. This is England demonstrates his strengths and his weaknesses in equal measure, with scenes that are too wordy and delivered by a mix of good and bad acting, but with a vibrant energy than owes a lot to the editing. Using amateur actors can yield great results for some directors but Shane Meadows doesn't know how to control the nervous amateur's need to say something - anything - in an effort to ""act"". If he's looking for reality, he wants to give some space to silence just like real life. Having said that though, there are some good scenes in This is England but nothing of any daring or originality. The film is certainly high on the Independent British Film quality list but unfortunately that's not saying very much at the moment.",This Is England

This section is an extension of the former ""Kinderfilmfest"" for teenagers between 14 and 18 - dealing with more mature issues.I had no clue about it, just that it would be about skinheads in England and that it takes place in the 80s. I wasn't expecting much, hoping for something like a British version of ""American History X"" - I got a lot more.When I left the theater I was absolutely stunned! Cast and script were outstanding. I loved the rough editing and grainy camera style that made the movie look a real 80s flick! And last but not least: the soundtrack is a blast! And coming from a director who used to be part of the real scene, it might be the most authentic picture about skinheads ever made.Although it didn't get as much attention as the Hollywood films that had their premiere at the Berlinale Palast, it's a lot stronger than almost all the films in competition.I hope it will make its way the movies and not end up as a direct-to-video-flick... 10/10",This Is England
167,AslanadelMare,Choice,8,17 June 2008,"It gives the viewer a look into a life of a young boy and how he becomes a gang member. It shows how circumstances like background and how your life evolves, can simply push you to the other side. Make you do things, just because it takes away the pain and loneliness.Is this England? Of course not, but for those young kids it was at that time. It's all they had. They needed something to believe in, to unite, to make them feel better about themselves. You get so see both sides in this movie. Positive: the friendship and sticking up for each other. Negative: vandalism and abuse. It shows you just how it is, think for yourself what you make of it.This movie is not only about racism. It's about no matter what is going on in your life: you get to choose what you do with your pain and frustration. You can see this development very well with the leader from the gang. The splitting up of the first group and the mixed up feelings of the formed 2nd group. They all need to choose. The leader who in the end explodes and takes it out on another human being after being rejected so many times (by LoL, old gang members, and others).The mother of the young boy wasn't even aware of how serious this gang was. You can tell this from the scene where she only complains about his hair to the group after his transformation.Ignorance and racism are very strong related to each other. The question this movie raises after you watched it is: what would you have done if you didn't know any better, like that little boy? But innocence has it's limits, we all know in our hearts it's wrong to take a life. No matter how comfortable he felt in that gang, he left. He took his responsibility, as young as he was: he made his choice. Throwing the flag symbolically into the sea at the end of the movie. Brilliant!",This Is England

173,louisdowling,Fantastic,7,30 December 2007,"This is a fantastic movie highlighting the nationalist atmosphere which was present in the white working classes of 1980s Britain. The film depicts the story of a young boy, Shaun, living in a run down council estate with his mother. Shaun's father died during the Falkland's war and the boy is often insulted regarding this whilst in school. One day he seems rather depressed so an older boy named Woody decides to form a friendship with him. As the story progresses, a new character is introduced called Combo who has very strong views regarding his patriotism and impresses Shaun who also impresses him. It is quite safe to say that Shaun sees Combo as a father figure and this may be the reason for their chemistry with each other. At this time in the movie, I began to feel a sense of pride however this opinion changed in the climax of the film which shows a brutal consequence of Combo's beliefs. After watching this I am determined to view more films directed by Shane Meadows as his brilliant abilities are obvious in this movie. Thomas Turgoose, who plays the film's main character, gives an excellent performance and has definitely got a lot of potential. I would also say that this movie is similar to ""American History X"". Overall, ""This is England"" is a very good movie and is well worth watching.",This Is England

This film goes to show that not only can Shane Meadows direct brilliantly, but write brilliantly as well. The film's climax (Milky's assault) was brilliantly scored by Ludovico, and made the scene extremely moving.The film does a spectacular job of really making the audience feel the emotions of the actors, and the roles taken up by these young actors are very well portrayed especially Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) and Combo (Steven Graham) After seeing the stuttering 'Tommy' from Snatch become an ex-con skinhead Combo, i will definitely look out for more films with him.For a well directed, and well acted film, I give it a 9/10",This Is England

178,low_flying,Decent work,7,2 July 2014,"This movie was somewhat tough to know how to take. On the one hand - as a movie about coming of age - it's a fairly straight-forward, effective film. Shaun's anger and depression about the death of his father fighting in the Falklands is slowly eating away at him, and his new skinhead friends don't help him learn to cope with that, but they do give him a distraction and a sense of belonging that he obviously craves. Shaun is easily influenced, and Woody becomes a type of father figure to him, helping him find his own place in the world around him. On the other hand, though, the movie in very insular. Combo talks about the money and jobs lost to immigrants, but aside from the Falklands, there doesn't seem to be any real link between this group of skins and the outside world. They never seem to actually exist in the real world, other than the mob's trip to the National Front rally and when Woody's girlfriend heads to work. So when Combo decides to espouse his political points of view to the rest of the gang, it feels hollow and almost disjointed; here is this group of skinheads who never seem to work and do nothing except sit around, drink beer, smoke pot, and listen to records. And as Combo has spent the last several years in prison, he doesn't feel like someone who would be in the know about the political situation in England at the time. However, the details of the movie are fairly accurate. The National Front did play a huge role in attracting skinheads to their cause in the 80s, and the fashions are pretty spot on, as is the music. Although I think that the movie doesn't make much of an effort to pander to the uninitiated. If you don't know skinhead culture, you're going to find yourself lost on occasion. But by and large, most of the movie can be understood and appreciated without knowledge of what it is to be skinhead. Overall a decent movie, if not a bit two dimensional.",This Is England
179,FrankBooth1,Another accomplished effort from Britain's most exciting director,9,12 May 2007,"Shane Meadows' new project is a semi-autobiographical work that casts an eye over the skinhead culture of the early 1980's, and is a film that cements his reputation as one of the UK's most exciting directing talents.Having grown up as a skinhead himself, Meadows through his recent press interviews has alluded - with some authority - to what he perceives as an unjust imbalance in how skinheads have come to be regarded in popular culture. This Is England goes some way to redressing the matter, but at the same time doesn't shy away from the more negative aspects that have become synonymous with the scene.The film tells the story of 12-year old Shaun, a young boy with few friends, and suffering at the hands of bullies in the playground. One day on his walk home, Shaun is befriended by Woody, a local skinhead, who introduces him to his friends, and pitying him, brings him into the group. Woody and his friends are the type of skinhead that the common stereotype forgets; there is a genuine warmth within the friendships, and Milky, a Jamaican skinhead, is probably the closest of Woody's mates. Yes, these lads are no angels; they break into derelict buildings and smash up the fixtures and fittings, they drink and they smoke, but they also have respect for themselves and other people; they are not violent, and they embrace black culture, not abhor it. In fact the camaraderie amongst these friends brought to mind two particular films of the past; Quadrophenia and Stand By Me.Like Meadows' prior works, the film is laced with many moments of genuine humour, and if anything, Made In England contains more laughs than any previous effort. But also in common with past films, there is an inevitability that matters are going to take a dark twist; and that arrives in the form of Combo.Fresh out of prison, Combo is a highly respected veteran of the scene and long time friend of Woody, but 3 years of incarceration have changed him as a man, and after dramatically announcing his return at a party, his nationalists leanings soon begin to surface. Suddenly a moment of choice awaits the gang, and while the warm and kind Woody chooses to disassociate himself with Combo, certain members, an entranced Shaun included, choose to stay.Here Meadows exposes the intolerable side of the culture, as the National Front's influence begins to permeate; Combo takes Shaun to meetings, and plays on the loss of his father in the Falklands to reinforce his beliefs. Although there are still moments of genuine humour and tenderness, and underlying sense of unease runs through the second half of the film, leading ultimately to an inevitable violent confrontation.The standard of acting from a predominantly amateur cast is terrific, especially from young Thomas Turgoose in the lead role. The characters are fantastically drawn, and wholly believable, while Meadows to his huge credit is able to even illicit sympathy towards the detestable Combo, showing him to be vulnerable, pathetic even, and to have been as susceptible to brainwashing as anyone. He even affords him a moment of at least partial redemption and realisation at the climax. The soundtrack as always with a Meadows film is perfectly compiled; a mixture of early 80's chart hits, Trojan reggae and melancholic piano led instrumentals. The crowning musical moment though lies with a beautiful acoustic cover of The Smiths' 'Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want' which accompanies Shaun in the film's closing scene, a moment of realisation that fittingly recalls the climax of Quadrophenia, a film to which This Is England owes so much.Very nearly Meadows' best work to date, arguably it is only Paddy Considine's absence this time out, that keeps Dead Man's Shoes top of the pecking order.",This Is England

184,overlookfm,This Is... The Best British Film For A Long Time,10,2 November 2006,"I was lucky enough to attend the first UK screening of Shane Meadows' latest offering, THIS IS ENGLAND, last Tuesday at the London Film Festival. Having been a fan of Meadows' work since seeing TWENTYFOURSEVEN in 1998, I have anticipated each of his new films with excitement and great interest. Meadows' films defy categorisation and always exceed expectation, as anyone who has seen A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS or DEAD MAN'S SHOES will attest. THIS IS ENGLAND had a lot to live up to Set during the summer of 1983, THIS IS ENGLAND is the story of Shaun (Thomas Turgoose); a precocious twelve-year-oldcoming to terms with the death of his father. Shaun is soon inducted into a group of local skinheads; a fun loving bunch who spend days committing petty vandalism and listening to ska records. Although much younger than the other members of the group, Shaun endears himself upon them with his sheer determination and defiance, and is quickly embraced as their mascot. However, the frivolity and naivety comes to an abrupt conclusion when ex-member Combo (Steven Graham) is released from a spell in prison. Combo soon causes a rift within the group and becomes the catalyst for them becoming a militant, racist force.Anyone familiar with Meadows' earlier work will notice many parallels between this and A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS; the film is told from a child's perspective and the corruption of youth/innocence is an underlining theme. Like ROMEO BRASS, THIS IS ENGLAND manages to balance the light-hearted and often hilarious, with menace and tension that's excruciating to endure. Many British films that attempt dramedy falter because one or the other/both is unconvincing, but Meadows manages to combine comedy and drama seamlessly; the laughs come thick and fact but the jolts come harder than a kick to the head.Typically for a Meadows film, THIS IS ENGLAND is exceptionally well written with some infectious dialogue and fully-fleshed characters, though one of the film's stand-out attributes is that of Danny Cohen's cinematography. Being a film set during the 80s, its look plays a significant part in the audience buying into the film. Many 80s-set films have been betrayed by garish lighting and ultimately end up looking like contemporary people parading around in 20-year-old clothing. Cohen's photography really manages to encapsulate the bleak feeling that was evident of the time, and is both gritty and dour. THIS IS ENGLAND is a film without polished aesthetics and one that has the raw visual style that's not be seen since the films of Alan Clarke (SCUM, MADE IN Britain, THE FIRM).In addition to the film's look, Meadow's has raided the vaults for a whole host of archive footage leading thirty-something viewers on a trip down memory lane. The credit sequence alone features footage from Roland Rat, the Falklands and Knight Rider; As a child of the 80s, I literally sat in the cinema beaming  It's a great hook into a wonderful film.As assured as Meadows' writing and direction is, the film benefits greatly from its ensemble cast. Predominantly made up of teenagers, the cast of THIS IS ENGLAND excel beyond belief, without one putting a foot wrong. A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS' Andrew Shim is superb as Milky, as is Stephen Graham as Combo - who gives a terrific and complex performance. However, THIS IS ENGLAND belongs to Thomas ""Tommo"" Tugoose  for a débutant child actor he is astonishing and effortlessly conveys the array of mixed emotions the material requires.In conclusion, THIS IS ENGLAND is essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in film. Once again Meadows has set a precedent for British filmmakers and has eclipsed many of his contemporaries. THIS IS ENGLAND may not make for comfortable viewing but it is cinema at its best.",This Is England
185,antplate,Bitter sweet rites of passage story set to skinheads,9,2 November 2006,"'This is England' is a must see for the type of persons who enjoy a good old 'innocence of youth' narrative (including a very comedic, almost cringe inducing, 'first kiss' scene) layered with powerful retrospective British realism reflecting early 1980's societal issues of the type that you wont see on any saccharin dipped 'i remember 1982' clip show.Based largely around the 'skinhead' activities of the early eighties its interesting to note that the story really draws distinctions between the types of skinheads - the nazi/racist and the two-tone/soul loving skinheads.Much like Mr Meadows other outings which tend to include a lot of relatively unknown and TV only actors/actresses, they all throw in sterling performances, particularly Stephen 'snatch' Graham as 'Combo'(sp.?) and the unknown Thomas Turgoose as young 'Sean'(sp?).The soundtrack is as usual strategically lined up to help convey with the overall look and feel, with musical styles ranging from reggae (toots and the maytals), punk and two tone. It does however include new music presumably for a soundtrack album sales point of view, what with the most underrated Clayhill covering The Smiths(?).overall: its as retrospective sharp as it is thought provoking, so if you lived anywhere near this time then see it: you may just like it. I you didn't then learn from this time in history when skin heads were either very open minded or very closed minded.",This Is England

However, I felt compelled to re-iterate all the positive reviews and comments I've seen here and elsewhere for this truly wonderful film.I was lucky enough to be given a free ticket for the BFI Festival viewing last Tuesday. A wonderful woman (now known as Lily) collared me in the queue for tickets and generously offered me a spare.We sat down and I knew things were looking good when the cast were introduced but eschewed the usual Q&A session by quickly introducing themselves and asking us to simply enjoy the film adding that if anyone had any questions at the end they'd be milling around for a chat.Anyway, enough of the preamble, to the film - it's an exemplary piece of work beautifully encapsulating the feelings of the eighties. The avarice of that time (both political and economic) juxtaposed against the heightened sense of revolt against a Thatcherite government that truly didn't seem to give a toss about anyone who wasn't on the gravy train.The script is razor sharp and the acting excellent! I'm not going to waste your time reviewing it but I will say, please go and see it for yourself (especially if you were growing up during the eighties)...You'll be rewarded with a superb soundtrack, laughter, sadness and at times real, palpable, tension.Love & Rockets, Lord E.",This Is England
187,elpellofa,Medows back at his best since TwuentyFourSeven.,9,9 November 2006,"Seen at: BFI - London Film Festival Shane Medows take on pro-Nazi minority groups comes at a time where racist extremism is uncannily blurred itself out of the picture. Although we are familiar with the non less aesthetic fear to terrorist attacks by fundamentalist Muslim groups, we have somehow forgot the 'collateral' damage that could arise in the eve of a Paris-suburb-style racial riot.This is England perpetuates a picture of a country not far from the one we are overlooking now but puts aside the blossoming images sold to the outside world of a hectic and prosperous London and a gay Brighton. The film takes us back to the Thatcher years in a clearly accentuated north of England ridden by jobless youth and financially stretch families, encapsulating a small landscape of issues that stirred the nation under the ""Iron Lady's rule"".Medows takes us in what could be described as the ""deep England journey"". North of the black underground line lay other counties where unemployment and lack of cultural resources are becoming predecessors for extremist thoughts. Social tensions are on the rise, and a new radical party, The National Front is taking advantage of the situation by blending anger and national pride, rallying people around the country.Matching the style of Mathieu Kassovitz (also director and writer) in La Haine, historical footage of the époque is embedded in between frames to illustrate the social expression of society. Furthermore, Danny Cohen's photography beautifully sets the landscape for the characters to take centre stage.The storyline evolves around a social micro-cosmos. The characters represent the blue print of residual society, perpetuated in the form of Shaun (Thomas Turgoose). At a very young age, Shaun has already endured the loose of his father at the Falklands War as well as facing financial hardship. He stands daily bulling from school peers, which brings him to state of outcast.He then becomes approached by an urban tribe of Ska-mod skin-heads. The group takes him under its wing as if a sort of mascot, although Shaun quickly becomes a strong character within the group, thanks to his stand up attitude. The group is soon divided by the return of old gang member Combo (Steven Graham) after a brief term in prison. Combo represents the pro-Nazi skinheads versus the fun loving petty vandalism of the Ska music and mod style teenagers.Steven Graham work deserves a standing ovation, far away of easy slapstick pop-corn performance he produced in Snatch (Guy Ritchie). Nevertheless his impressive characterisation of Combo is somehow overshadowed by Thomas Turgoose first ever acting role. Although presented at a later stage in the movie as the anti hero, it is impossible not to feel for his profound facial expression and sympathise with his early age portrayal of innocence.Despite all round notable performances from the rest of the cast, I feel terribly let down by Jo Hartley's mediocre interpretation as Shaun's mother; however this can be considered a minor decay to an all round great piece of contemporary art.This is England crosses the boundary of the purely British audience oriented motion picture to a larger scale scenario where its intricacies are presented in manners which well enable the international audience to get a small picture of a bigger problem.In a world that tries to trade our eyes for feelings by diverting our attention to the big picture, such as United 93, it might be of some use to stop and stare at the small picture. This little, yet well behaved movie, might allow us to adapt our eyes to the dark and pay more attention to detail.By Jordi Llàtzer",This Is England

Shane Meadows is an amazing director with a surprisingly good eye for realism, the acting in this film is brilliant, especially the hilarious Tom Turgoose, total legend. I'm a big fan of Meadows especially Dead Mans Shoes which is up there as one of the best British films ever. He is a big inspiration to me and one of the reasons i want to get into film, to make something as good and as moving as This is England. i really recommend this because its a funny tearjerker that will leave you on the edge of your seat. if you have the chance to see it SEE IT! its a define top 250 contender and I'm sure it will be in there in no time.",This Is England

Its called ""this is england"". It is based in the early 1980's when the Falklands war was on and I realised how much influence it has had in my life, without ever knowing where the stuff came from. When I think of you and me and the battle we have been through as youngsters torn between sets of ideas, you know, having our most important first years in england and then swapping to Spain and assimilating the changes and adaptation to different ideas and then finally, weighing things up and creating our own worlds within us. We don't belong to a single set of ideas, we shift all the time. The thing is, when watching that film, I can feel how deeply the ""english"" theme is ingrained, its like a scar, Man those first years are so crucially vital for memes to set up shop. Its funny because when I cut all my hair off I felt things inside me but i didn't know what they were. It was only momentary. I remember when mum used to get both our heads shaved all the time. I will bring the film over, its definitely for the archives.",This Is England
191,rjgill,An Epic copy,8,1 May 2007,"As a huge fan and critic of the great British escape from repetitive American film, 'This Is England' is a look into the rising trend of a stereotypical England commoner. The meat head gang (featured in the film) tend to show us how a rough character from England, is not living in a mansion, were not drinking tea like its vital and were not playing Crockett and naming ourselves 'Rupert'. The film itself is well structured and is focused like a good soap, featuring the turning points, humour, grace, politics and friction. I give 'This Is England' and eight because we've seen this kind of frame before in 'The Football Factory', 'Green Street' and 'Kidulthood'. Yet saying that a good friend of mine who plays the part of 'Woody' is a big part of the film so i have to obviously direct myself in favour of this film. Overall, is't worth watching at some point.",This Is England
192,thelovetractor,This is good but not great (SPOILERS!),6,16 May 2007,"It's been a long time in my celluloid watching life since a real appreciation of a film some three quarters of the way in has subsided to head shaking and disappointment by the closing credits.I can't add any more to the reviews already on here - plot development, narrative, humour, recreation of 80's England and acting (on the whole) are all top drawer.But what sort of ending was that ?? The scene in which Combo (superb performance by the actor by the way) finally succumbed to the demons and prejudice within was fantastic and would have made a worthy finale to the film. Stop it there. No context required. No need to wrap things up.But another 15 mins followed.Firstly I'm not quite sure what the archive clips from the Falklands were trying to achieve - Adding resonance to the story just told ?? by a representation of misguided nationalism ?? or a reflection of the jingoism of the time ?? I'm not sure. The music certainly didn't help - the soaring, emotive classical accompaniment was overly mawkish and just made me feel I was being manipulated into a war is wrong/thatcher was bad standpoint. The film was great no need to increase the scope or make sure we knew it's intentions.Why the need to let us know Milky was OK in the scene with Sean and his mum ? - surely it hits harder not knowing this.But the final scene was so grandiose. Here comes the classical music again and Sean rejects the life he was leading by symbolically throwing the flag into the sea. Terrible, overblown and - dare I say it - 100% Hollywood. It reminded me of the scenes from those 80's cop movies where the grizzled NY cop having cleared his name - or that of his dead buddy - and exposed the bad cops ends the film by casting his badge/commendation into the sea.So yet again the inability to end a film well and avoid MAKING IT REALLY CLEAR HOW YOU SHOULD FEEL really tarnishes the experience as a whole.",This Is England

194,tacaspunk,Overall- This is England well worth watch,9,10 July 2007,"I personally enjoyed This is England and I'm looking forward to the release date here in the US to watch it again. July 27th as far as I know. For those of us who disliked American History X for example because it never tells the true roots of the skinhead, This is England is much more believable. For those who dislike the racism issue, it unfortunately still exists and is especially a frequent issue for those still involved in the punk/ skin scene. This is England is more enjoyable than Made in Britain(1982), and even Suburbia(1984). Perhaps it is the fact that Shane Meadows himself was a skin growing up that the film hits right on target with facts, from clothes to the music although it is not a documentary like Skinhead Attitude(2003) or American Hardcore (2006)you still walk away having learned something new from a ""sub-culture"" that the media only portrays in a negative light.",This Is England
195,cornisle1,Expected a Lot More.,5,12 July 2007,"After seeing Meadows' previous efforts I was expecting great things from this film. It starts off well, the 1980s setting really shining through. But as soon as the young lad joins the skinheads it's just too unbelievable, expecting the audience to accept the plot developments as normal human interaction. For instance, the romance of a pre-pubescent boy with a girl of at least 16, and it remains unquestioned by all as if it's normal. The acceptance of the lad's mother of her 12 year old son joining a gang of older, smoking and drinking skinheads. None of it rings true. Meadows has made much in the publicity of this film stating that skinheads weren't all racist NF thugs, but in the film there are only a couple of them who don't immediately jump in with Combo and his NF mates. There just isn't much plot development, Woody starts off as one of the main characters but as soon as Combo turns up is hardly seen at all.Very disappointing. This and ""Once Upon A Time In The Midlands"" are leading me to question whether Meadows can be as consistently talented as I was hoping he would be.",This Is England

DO NOT WATCH! You have been warned. 2 great examples of the poor quality of the film;a scene where Shane and his mum are looking at a picture of his dad and both comment its their favourite picture of him, in the picture , you cant even see his face! As well as this, during the movie a girl who must have been about 10 years older than him comes on to him! It just comes across twisted and made the film seem even less real.

197,pib and pob,A highly overrated film. (Only minor spoilers.),3,17 September 2007,"I watched this film last night with anticipation, but really wasn't very impressed.With the exception of 'Combo', I thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited. It came across like a 'made for TV' drama.I felt that the film was very contrived. The whole set up of hammering in the context at the start (yes, we get that this is 80s Britain - you can stop now) was tiresome, and gave a very one-sided view of what life was like in 80s Britain - poverty, war juxtaposed with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, yet nothing in between? There were actually middle-classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people, with a decent wage and a mortgage. The Falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end, for 'dramatic effect', I presume.The sequence of events felt a tad disjointed, as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could've changed so quickly.The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was toe-curling. I couldn't even look during the snogging scene. I find it very hard to believe that she would've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger, but also looked so much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties, yet it's a huge difference in your teens! In my experience, that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one, since girls mature so much quicker, and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value.The ending was somewhat abrupt and, again, contrived. If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell somewhat short in my eyes.It bugs me that British films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty-stricken. Don't get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but can't we Brits come up with anything different? Why are our films always so hung up on the class system? I was born in 1973, so wasn't much different in age to 'Shaun' would've been in 1983. I grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down-trodden council estate in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - I don't even remember racism being an issue (although i'm not saying it didn't exist). 'This is England'? Not in my experience.The bottom line is that I felt this film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and unimpressed throughout.",This Is England

It shows people and the influences of the world/country they are living in. None of them basically bad people just miss guided, guidance which is still often missing in this world.This film does not give answers but gives you the opportunity to remember if you have been in these situations or learn what other parts of the real world are like if you haven't.For me an amazing flash back it could have been a documentary even the pellet guns god they stung.",This Is England

I did't know anything about it, more than the fact that the poster had a 12 year old skinhead on it.It really got me surprised.First of all, the language. Yes, they speak English, but they speak REAL English, with some really heavy accent and a lot of funny words. As a swede, it was kind of challenging to keep up with it without subtitles. But it was fun. And most important of all, it gives you the right feeling.Second of all, and this was really impressing, was the setting. The stage crew sure have done their homework for this one. It looks EXACTLY how imagined England to look back in the 70s. Most impressive.Though the story is kind of thin (very predictive in a way) it still makes a good movie. Mostly because of the language and the setting, but then of course the acting is a very big part of the success. 8/10 is a perfect, and very fair, rating for this one and I highly recommend it.",This Is England

The screenplay was written by a 30-year-old Shawn (the kid portrayed by Tom Turgoose in the film). His ability to write an award-winning memoir/screenplay later in life is a testament to his success, and to the truth that one doesn't have to live up to their prescribed social status (in this case, that of a destitute, working-class skin-head).The lead actor in this film (Tom Turgoose) is also testament to this. Tom is no Daniel Radcliffe. He wasn't brought up by British actors to become a British actor. Tom was discovered through a social program for struggling children. He had been expelled from school and was living with his dying single mother. He was a tenement kid who broke windows and graffitied in his spare time.

It was spellbinding to watch the audience reaction as the set up of the film had its share of laughs for the youthful abandonment and micky taking that made up being a teenager during these times. Switching gear, trouble arrives like a boot to the face, in the shape of Combo. Releasd from prison and seeped in nationalist rhetoric. I found the film made an important distinction between the clans of traditional and neo-nazi skinheads. A point that has been long overdue in film.

203,bonzojade-51764,Awesome Film,9,4 January 2016,"I watched this film in Film Studies not long ago and it is only my second Shane Meadows film, however as soon as the teacher said who's film it was, I was excited. I'd seen 'Dead Man's Shoes' and loved every second of it.Now, I expected a similar film, it is in some ways. For one, the gritty, realistic and sometimes uncomfortable subject matter and portrayals are all very similar. However, This is England also manages to capture the fun that teens/young people manage to find in the 80s through the most random of ways (smashing up houses and shooting each other with air guns). Almost every character is likable and most are well-fleshed out (with the exception of Pukey, Kes and Meggy who are given less screen time).The leader of the apolitical skinheads is Woody played by Joe Gilgun and he plays the role spectacularly. He is a kind-hearted guy, trying to help Shaun (the protagonist) after an emotionally tiring day. He seems to be an authority in the group, followed by Milky (Andrew Shim). Milky always seems to back up Woody's decisions and is equally warm-hearted.The accuracy (from what I've researched into skinhead and mod culture in Britain) is brilliant, obviously due to Meadow's experience as a boy.It is at first light-hearted despite some bullying of Thomas Turgoose's Shaun. However, at a party the mood changes when an old acquaintance of Woody's and Lol's shows up after being released from prison. However, it is told that he did time for Woody. Therefore you expect him to be just part of the gang, albeit a bit older, unfortunately you would be wrong. Combo is not a pleasant guy to stomach during this film, almost immediately he asserts racist views in front of the whole group. This is not only despicable in and of itself but when he spots Milky (a black man) he apologizes but still uses slurs. The music eventually overshadows this as it is clear the party has gone sour now.The whole film focuses on Thatcher's reign and the Falklands War, with many references, diegetic radio announcements and clips at the beginning of the film and towards the end after (MAJOR SPOILER!!!) Combo has beaten Milky, almost to death.Overall, if you like quirky, warm films with serious undertones and cultural references, you will love this. The whole cast delivered stunning performances and it worth a watch, honestly.",This Is England
204,Cut-ThroatJake,"Good idea for a film, badly done.",2,5 April 2007,I was expecting a British equivalent of American History X but the story was awful the characters 1 dimensional the script not thought through at all. If your going to do improvising you should do lots of workshops with the cast beforehand.I can't believe that this was based on Shane Meadows life in any way at all. It just wasn't realistic. It seemed to me that it was made not with an insiders perspective but how he perceived it to be. It probably would have been better if he'd just done a little research and a few interviews.This could have been a really good film. But I found it to be patronising. The NF in the 70's and 80's hijacked the Union Jack not the George Cross. The only reason for using the latter I can see is to make out that all the English people flying the flag round world cup time were racist idiots. This should have been Crash meets American History X in England. But its just weak.The sets were well dressed and the costumes looked good. Thomas Turgoose was good as Shaun and so was Stephen Graham as Combo. apart from that it was rubbish in my opinion.,This Is England
205,sfiller-2,Loses its way - overrated,5,13 September 2007,"My friend Charisse perceived that the film is autobiographical.I am sick of films that cop out with fear of falling like Beauty and the Beast and Batman or crucifying a black man like Unforgiven and White Boyz. And ever since Jaws, of films that start out giving you a society,a community, and abandon it, for a little drama of two or three maniacs. And how can those mice in Rescuers Down Under just FORGET the prisoners they were among? But it's the film does. Especially kid films - they think kids don't think, don't remember, don't care.Grand Illusion ends up with just the two guys, but it's different.In this film, the bad skins terrorize and rob Sandhu. The boy gets even for Sandhu's making him stop reading the comics. (In Erbaugh's in late 1940's Yellow Springs, when Bud Johnson would say, ""Put up the funny books, boys."" But how does the boy in the film read so FAST? Bip. Ha ha ha ha ha. Turn page. Ha ha ha ha ha, so disassociated that he doesn't read or feel, just pretends to in his ad-if world. Poor kid!!!) Does anyone think Mr. Sandhu is not calling the police? That there are no consequences? Even if Mr. Sandhu did not know the boy's family, as we have heard him state he does, do we think that he--or his Simpsons parallel in US for that matter, who once, when Homer goes to work for him, advises Homer to take the inevitable bullet in the shoulder--will crumble? He will not, and is stereotype but a formidable though undeveloped character.When the robbery and terrorizing of Sandhu--which the film suggests could have led to someone being killed--are left as a mere symbolic detail, like a shot of someone throwing a candy wrapper on the sidewalk--the film has lost its realism and we don't know where the hell we are.The little scene of bullying the kids playing soccer uses the victims as props, enacting a filmic racism in parallel to the characters' racism and gaining no authenticity by doing so; rather, discrediting its authority when it needs it. There is a Pakistani-English community to deal with. Thatcher may or may not give a darn, but I do and I expect no less of my sensitive flawless (New York Times with an almost) film.The good skins too are a community, and this becomes the subject as the boy goes there from isolation and becomes social. It reminds me of the baptisms in Tender Mercies, where the kid is in his fifties. This community is INTERESTING and filmically REAL, and should not be dropped for crappy melodrama. PC is no excuse. The bad skins stride forward side by side the boy in his long black coat. Clockwork Orange, which I have not seen. I feel for him. Who is worse for him? The bad guy, or the girl who has him suck her tits? The bad guy's sins can be washed away with the blood of a Negro, whose death, euphemized with a trip to the hospital provides a neat cure for the boy's attraction to violent fascist-racist-nationalism. But what will become of the girl we get no clue. The whole latter part of the film is composed of in-your-face see what's happening so you can understand the plot stuff--the woman rejects the bad guy so he gets mad and has to kill a black guy and worse, use the n-word, climactic revelation of his wrongness. A film that was a film about some kids trying to cope has to go Hollywood. Compare Slacker, also about growing up absurd (I cannot tell hat the other book title is. I went to a lecture by Goodman in Cleveland. He was a big celebrity.) Slacker never forgets it's a film.There is a point in This Is England where you sense that the film has run out of truth and is wondering where to go. It tries to pull back together at the end with more news footage, to draw back from it's little racial-violence porno fling into a social perspective, but that device doesn't do it. I want to know about the kids, the good skins if you will. I want what started to continue and develop. I want people I have begun to care about to stay around and do something. Have to stop here.

Well, I can happily inform you, that he has gone one better.This is England is a snapshot of my 80's childhood. Every detail is there, from the fashions, TV programmes, soundtrack and environment. This alone is a visionary masterclass, but is secondary to a well-crafted tale of life on a housing estate.The main focus of the film is a small boy called Shaun (played by Thomas Turgoose), I won't go into his background as it will spoil the film, but Thomas Turgoose steals the show from a brilliant set of actors. He befriends a gang of happy-go-lucky skinheads, and his transformation from bullied schoolboy to wannabe skinhead is a touching and moving piece of movie-making. But as things spiral out of control Shaun is faced with some tough situations. The heart of this film is a young boy finding his way through life and learning some tough lessons.I recommend everyone go see this film, especially if you are in your thirties.
