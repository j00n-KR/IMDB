0,TheLittleSongbird,"This Boss Baby has ruthless wit and a heart, if also inconsistency",6,30 August 2017,"Was not expecting much at all from 'The Boss Baby'. The trailers were absolutely dreadful, some of the worst for any film released this year, giving the impression that 'The Boss Baby' would be one of the year's worst films.Still saw 'The Boss Baby' with an open mind and with a willingness to give it a fair chance. Especially considering that there has been a fair share of films seen by me that have awful, misleading advertising but actually turned out to be good to outstanding films (like 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame', 'Galaxy Quest' and 'Lilo and Stitch', that gave the complete opposite impressions of the films they turned out to be). After seeing it, 'The Boss Baby' is not a great film and its quality is inconsistent, but it was much better than expected and was nowhere near the awful film the advertising made it look.DreamWorks have certainly done far better, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is outstanding, 2010's best animated film (just edging out 'Tangled') and one of the year's best, and 'The Prince of Egypt' is one of my favourite films. 'The Boss Baby' is towards their weaker end of their animations along with 'Bee Movie' and especially 'Home'. There are still a lot of great merits.First and foremost, the animation is extremely good. Meticulous in detail and vibrantly colourful, and the characters are modelled appealingly. The soundtrack is infectious and catchy, with the choices in music fitting well. Some of the jokes are very funny and witty, with sly and clever references to some of Alec Baldwin's other roles and a surprising gag based on David Mamet, that is daring for an animated film.Underneath all the wit, 'The Boss Baby' also has a heart with a few touching moments and important lessons on love and family. This angle doesn't come completely successfully certainly but the good intentions are there and it is not as if it didn't try. Mostly the film moves along with a lot of energy. There are a few entertaining characters along the way, with the titular character recalling fond memories of Alec Baldwin's character in '30 Rock'. The voice acting is terrific, especially a dynamite turn from Baldwin.'The Boss Baby' on the other hand is not without its faults. The story is formulaic, with a thin premise stretched thin and is let down by a very messy utter chaos of a first act. Not all the jokes hit the mark, hurt by predictability, a tendency to veer towards doodiness in alternative to wit and a lack of maturity, while the family values angle doesn't come off entirely successfully, some of it being mawkish and preachy.Not all the characters work either, some of them are very sketchily written and developed. This is especially with Steve Buscemi's villainous character. Buscemi excels at villains and does his very best in a role that should have been tailor made for him, but lacks the material to properly sink his teeth into it.In conclusion, uneven but nowhere close to being as bad as the advertising and some of the critical reaction made it look. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Boss Baby
1,SnoopyStyle,surprisingly good,7,30 September 2017,"Tim Templeton has the perfect life. He and his parents form the perfect triangle. His parents work at Puppy Co. One day, a new baby (Alec Baldwin) arrives at their door. Tim is bitter that his parents are completely head over heels for the impeccably suited baby. He's actually a smart Boss Baby on a mission for Baby Corp to stop Puppy Co.'s new Forever Puppy.I expected nothing more than another stupid kids movie relying on poop jokes. This is more than that. There is surprisingly few poop jokes. On the other hand, it has an interesting original idea and it works. It's kinda fun and hits on a real thing about sibling rivalries. The characters are good. I'm shocked that this is pretty good.",The Boss Baby
2,Horst_In_Translation,Never lives up to its premise or ambition,4,6 April 2017,"The 90-minute ""The Boss Baby"" is one of the more known animated movies from 2017. It is an American production and in the English language of course. The fact that it was made by Dreamworks results in several known names working in here as voice actors, such as Alec Baldwin voicing the title character. You can find out the other names by looking at the cast list. I must say I watched the German dub though, so we got the voice of Dr. House for this title character here as he is also Alec Baldwin's voice. But somehow it wasn't working out really and it just wasn't fitting the character well. Anyway, the movie runs for 90 minutes and it had many other flaws too. First of all, I must say the human protagonist, i.e. the boy, was completely forgettable in terms of his looks and actions. If you show a picture of him to people (maybe parents) 10 years from now, probably almost nobody will remember where he was from, even if they have seen the film. That's one problem. Another problem would be that the ambition the film has and the emotional impact they are trying to make, also at the very end with the return scene of the baby, are never as effective as they want them to be. This also refers to the lullaby references, pretty crucial throughout the movie, but they are never well-crafted enough to make an impact really or to get your eyes wet.The main antagonist here looks like an animated version of Oscar winner Jim Broadbent to be honest, but he was okay, even if I somehow expected him to return later on as a villain when we see Boss Baby idolizing him on the picture. Reminded me a bit of ""Up"". Some okay film references are included in here as well, for example Indiana Jones. Besides that, I liked the early references most of the time when the film switches between how the boy sees reality and what it really looks like, for example when he learns how to use his bicycle or also the prison room scene somewhere in the middle of the film. But all these solid scenes do not really make up for all the weaknesses. For example, how does the antagonist still know who he was? I am not sure if stopping to drink the special milk erases the memory, but if not, then probably I'd have expected the characters who appear at the very end to erase his memory just like it happens with the parents. A bit of a pity, but as a whole I need to agree with the critics who did not really enjoy the movie. I think the general plot, even if a bit on the childish side (but hey it's a film about babies), isn't bad by any means, but a strong execution and love to detail is missing almost entirely. Many of the jokes and plays on words were also really only attempts at comedy. But the ""Scary Poppins"" wasn't bad. I'll give them that. Maybe also the German dubbing was bad for some reason. I don't know. I have to give it a thumbs-down though and the overall outcome is really only good enough for young audiences I think unlike some other recent animated movies that also have a strong impact on adults. This one here not so much. Watch something else instead.",The Boss Baby
3,Prismark10,Puppy love,6,26 July 2017,"The Boss Baby is a film that kids will enjoy and the adults will find it amiable and also get the message.It has a 1970s tinge to it with music from television shows of the era. An imaginative 7 year old boy, Tim has great loving parents but when a baby brother arrives they have less time for him as the newcomer manipulates attention from them and Tim gets elbowed out.From Tim's imaginative mind this new baby is the boss, a business baby sent on a mission to unearth something that will take away grown ups attention and love towards babies. Tim and his baby brother join forces to infiltrate a shady company that has developed the next must have puppy dogs.The film has a bit of a formulaic ring about it which a lot of Disney and Dreamworks animations have when it comes to the reveal of the film's villain. It also is a bit disjointed at times, scenes inserted where the brothers have unnecessary falling outs.Still Alec Baldwin is in his element as the Boss baby and he certainly means business.",The Boss Baby
4,nogodnomasters,I wish you've never been born,5,15 July 2017,"Tim is an only child who loves being an only child. He has an over active imagination. When the new baby arrives by cab and in a suit, Tim has questions and doesn't like the attention the baby gets, believing he is being deprived of love...not the best family message out there. However, the baby was sent from Baby Corp (in heaven?) to investigate the new puppy being introduced as puppies have replaced babies as being loved the most. Tim's parents are marketers for Puppyco. Message: Lovable designer dogs-bad.Of course in the end Tim and baby bond and love each other, but there were some pains getting there. I guess I am the only person who heard this, but when the baby is first discovered he says something that sounds like""' F-word' who doey."" It was quick but clear and distinctive. I am not sure what Dreamworks is trying to pull.Hearing Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin as the Boss Baby and say ""You're Fired"" didn't bring things home. The movie had some entertaining scenes for the kids and even adults, but I would recommend parents see the film first before they let their kids view it. While the over all message is designed to be positive, that might not be what a child might take away.",The Boss Baby
5,jboothmillard,The Boss Baby,5,5 March 2018,"I saw the trailer for this computer-animated film at the cinema, it looked like a relatively amusing kids' movie, I became more interested in seeing when it became part of the Awards Season nominations, directed by Tom McGrath (Madagascar, Megamind). Basically seven-year-old Tim Templeton (Miles Christopher Bakshi) has an over-active imagination, and enjoys life with his parents, Ted (Jimmy Kimmel) and Janet (Lisa Kudrow), who work for a puppy factory called Puppy Co. founded by a man named Francis E. Francis (Steve Buscemi). Tim is surprised to see an infant wearing a black business suit carrying a briefcase arriving at his house in a taxi, Tim's parents tell him it is his baby brother. Tim is envious of the attention the baby is receiving, he is also suspicious when the infant acts odd around him. Soon Tim learns that the Baby (Alec Baldwin) can talk like an adult, he introduces himself as ""The Boss"". Seeing an opportunity to get rid of him, Tim records a conversation between the Boss Baby and other toddlers who are in Tim's house for a meeting (under the guise of a play date) to do something about puppies receiving more love and attention than babies. The Boss Baby and the other infants catch Tim with the recording, the cassette tape is destroyed, the Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favourite stuffed animal if he crosses him. With no evidence to support him, Tim is grounded by his parents, much to his and the Boss Baby's dismay. The Boss Baby apologises to Tim, giving him a pacificer that will transport him to the place he comes from, Baby Corp., where infants with adult-like minds can preserve their youth. The Boss Baby explains that he stays intelligent and youthful with a ""Secret Formula"", if a baby does not drink it after a period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. The Boss Baby also explains that he is on a mission to infiltrate Puppy Co., which is unleashing a new puppy, which threatens the love and need for babies everywhere. If he succeeds in discovering what the new puppy is, he will get a portrait on a wall, and a new corner office, with a high chair and a private potty. Tim and Boss Baby overhear the Big Boss Baby (Edie Mirman) threatening to fire him for not bringing information, which would strip him of the formula and strand him with the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to keep that from happening. Tim's parents lift the grounding, seeing him bond with the Boss Baby, they take them to Puppy Co. to the ""take your child to work day"", there they are able to sneak into the backroom where they find plans for a ""Forever Puppy"". But this turns out to be trap, set by Francis, who used to be the head of Baby Corp. and Boss Baby's idol, he was forced out after becoming lactose intolerant which stopped the formula working properly. Vowing revenge, Francis founded Puppy Co. and intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing the Boss Baby's secret formula and infecting puppies with it. Tim's parents are tricked into a trip with Francis to Las Vegas, where he plans to launch the Forever Puppy, Francis and his brother Eugene (Conrad Vernon) pose as a babysitter to keep them from interfering. Without a steady flow of formula to maintain his intelligence, Boss Baby starts becoming a normal baby, but they manage to escape Eugene, but they are too late reaching the airport to stop the parents getting onto the flight to Vegas. Tim and Boss Baby let out their frustrations with each other, but they quickly make up, and sneak onto another plane heading to Vegas, filled with Elvis impersonators. They reach the hotel and stall Francis' presentation, furious at their interference, Francis traps Tim's parents under the rocket tat will launch the Forever Puppy worldwide. Tim and Boss Baby defeat Francis, knocking him into a large container of formula, Boss Baby opens the rocket to let out all the puppies, the parents are saved, but his return to baby state is complete, but Tim sings a song to help him down from the rocket, before it launches, now baby Francis is taken away by the authorities. Boss Baby gets promoted and leaves the Templetons, the parents are hypnotised to forget about him, Tim chooses not to forget him, he goes back to being an only child, but he and Boss Baby miss each other. Tim writes a letter to Boss Baby convincing him to live with him as his brother, he returns to the Templetons as a regular baby, named Theodore Lindsey ""Ted"" Templeton. In the present day, adult Tim (Tobey Maguire), also narrating, finishes his story, he is now father to two daughters, one of which acts like Ted when he was Boss Baby, wearing a business suit. Also starring Eric Bell Jr. as Triplets and ViviAnn Yee as Staci. Baldwin is a good choice as the wisecracking power-hungry tycoon tyke, it is a fairly good story of bickering forced siblings who slowly join forces to win a baby-puppy cuteness war, the script is witty and funny, only occasionally mawkish, and the animation is pretty good, overall it is a fun and reasonable family animated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Worth watching!",The Boss Baby
6,paul_haakonsen,"Fun concept at first glace, but once into it, nah...",4,22 December 2018,"Now an animated movie like ""The Boss Baby"" is something that would ordinarily fall way out of my usual movies that I watch. But having an 8 year old kid makes you watch a bunch of strange animated movies, and thus I ended up watching ""The Boss Baby"".First of all I must say that the storyline was not really particularly interesting. Everything in the storyline was just way too predictable and unoriginal for my personal liking. But my son seemed to enjoy it.The animation and the art in the animated movie was actually quite good, and it does help the movie along quite a way. And it did definitely help a lot as well that they had a great ensemble of actors to perform the voice acting in the movie. Personally I think that the voice acting cast can be a make or break factor for an animated movie, and luckily they had gone for a great crew here.""The Boss Baby"" hardly was a memorable animated movie experience for me. And ever since we watched it, my son didn't talk about it ever again. So I guess it didn't leave a lasting impression on him. So I assume that this is one of those animated movies that come by the dozen, surface and then sinks into oblivion without ever becoming a true classic.",The Boss Baby
7,neil-476,"Fun for grownups, too",8,14 May 2018,"Tim's new baby brother has a secret: to all intents and purposes, he is an adult in a baby's body, tasked with foiling a dastardly plan to divert the love for babies into a love for puppies. But first of all, there is a battle for supremacy between Tim and this new arrival.This film is very silly. It also has a fairly original story. And the trailer doesn't give you the whole story: the latter half isn't spoiled at all.It is interesting to consider the audience here. Yes, it is a film for kids, but it also has a great deal which will go way above kids' heads (the TV trailer used in the UK contains the line ""Cookies are for closers"" - what on earth does that mean to a child?). So there is broad appeal.Because it is funny but also interesting, with some moderate suspense. Much of the humour comes from what is essentially an adult in a baby's body (although the film does try - and succeeds - in having its cake and eating, with the Boss Baby (brilliantly voiced by Alex Baldwin) being credible as both baby and Boss.The characters and settings are graphically simple, but that's quite a good thing. The animation is - as expected - first rate, and the ""play"" sequences add some welcome surrealism and jazzy design.As a Beatles fan, it was nice to see ""Blackbird"" playing an important part.This film was fun.",The Boss Baby
8,evanston_dad,An Animated Film Made to Be Instantly Forgotten,5,12 April 2017,"Disposable animated film with sub-par voice talent, which is surprising that the voices are provided by the likes of Alec Baldwin, Jimmy Kimmel, Steve Buscemi, and Lisa Kudrow. To be fair, the material they're given isn't great, so it might be hard to judge how much falls to them and how much to the film around them. It's entertaining in spurts, but there's nothing surprising and I found myself growing fidgety. My kids seemed to like it well enough, but they're not exactly the most discerning audience.Grade: C",The Boss Baby
9,Mr-Fusion,This baby's a nice surprise,6,24 April 2017,"Here's another shining example of marketing gone wrong. That ""cookies are for closers"" line that was in all of the trailers for ""The Boss Baby"" made it seem like an obnoxious kids movie, especially one that shamelessly mines one of Baldwin's greatest lines for cheap laughs. I dreaded this movie for that very reason, and the line (as delivered) actually comes off rather organically. It's no big deal at all. I liked this movie more than I thought I would, that's for certain. Despite the character designs (those dilated pupils get old quick) and a sticky-sweet ending, the theme of first-born displacement is pretty touching. And the LSD-inspired humor in a baby's love for its binky was surprisingly inventive; also surprising is the comedic value in a wizard alarm clock. Seriously, the laughs come when you least expect them. 6/10",The Boss Baby
10,Hellmant,A decent kids' movie but nothing more.,5,4 May 2017,"'THE BOSS BABY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A computer-animated kids' flick, based on the 2010 picture book, of the same name, by Marla Frazee. It tells the story of a seven-year- old boy that's introduced to a new baby brother, only to learn that the baby is a secret agent, voiced by Alec Baldwin, that's leading a war against puppies. It costars the voices of Miles Christopher Bakshi, Tobey Maguire, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow. The film was directed by Tom McGrath (who also co-directed the first three 'MADAGASCAR' movies) and it was scripted by Michael McCullers (who also co-scripted two 'AUSTIN POWERS' movies, and wrote and directed 'BABY MAMA'). It's gotten mixed reviews from critics, but it's also a huge hit at the Box Office. I found it to be about average for a silly animated kids' movie.Timothy Templeton, as an adult (Maguire), tells a story about when he was seven-years-old (Bakshi) and first introduced to his baby brother (Baldwin). Tim is immediately jealous of all the attention his new brother steals away from him. He's also suspicious of some really strange activity; like the fact that the baby wears a suit and carries a briefcase. He later learns that his brother is trying to lead a war against puppies, with the other babies in town. Tim tries to convince his parents (Kimmel and Kudrow) this, but they're convinced he just has a very active imagination (which he obviously does).The movie is creative and somewhat imaginative, and I like the way the filmmakers tell it's story. Right away I got the sense that it's all symbolism for how a child deals with accepting a new baby brother. You of course have to watch it all the way till the end though, to know for sure. The jokes are all aimed at kids unfortunately though, and they're all extremely silly. So other than the creative storytelling, the movie doesn't have a lot to offer adults. Which is fine, it's still a decent kids' movie but nothing more.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/K3Maw4akm_o",The Boss Baby
11,thesar-2,Stewie Already Did It,8,27 May 2017,"What cute baby. Oh, yes you are. Cuuuutie baby! Egad!It's gotta be tough for animators these days. Especially for those not employed by Disney/Pixar. Appealing to toddlers, kids, young adults and adults with an original story and take on an animated featureBut, The Boss Baby handled it in spades. Sure, if you put Stewie and this Boss Baby in opposite corners, only Stewie would emerge as the victor, at least we got more of Alec Baldwin as the antihero we all know he is.Basically, the only-child of a triangle family is threatened by a newborn that plans on world-business-dominance and if they don't stop a convenient-plot-villain subplot together, they will be orphans. Or worseWhat's nice about this movie/story is that it's not trying to win an Oscar®. It's not trying to out-Indiana Jones the competition. It's what it is: a fun, deep and funny animated feature to entertain and never take from the competition. Just have fun, laugh a lot and be entertained as planned.Okay, maaaaybe, it should be for a little older crowd. There's a bunch of humor and innocent nudity that the younger kids wouldn't like, don't need to see or understand. I guess this is what separates The Boss Baby from The FamilyPixar.***Final thoughts: Though he's gonna be known soon for the bestest Cheeto impersonator, Alec, here, made me just want to rewatch one of my favorite action films: Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. Every time I heard his voice, I thought of the Tom Cruise franchise and wanted to pop that in. Too bad THAT's what I know him as and not the truth behind Cheeto or any of the other great works he's associated with.",The Boss Baby
12,cherold,I guess this is fine if you're a kid,5,4 August 2017,"There are three basic types of family friendly cartoons. There are some that are entertaining to both adults and kids. There are some only entertaining for the young set. And then, of course, there are some that everyone hates.As an adult with no children, I have to guess as to the child appeal of Boss Baby, but for elderly me, this movie falls short.My guess is that kid's would like it. The basic premise is pretty good. A young boy, whose imagination causes him to describe all his experiences in wildly unlikely terms, gets a baby brother who wears a suit and is plotting against him and other things. The boy's flights of fancy are imaginatively handled, as in his portrayal of a baby play date as a horror-movie nightmare.But imaginative isn't the same as funny, and the movie's humor feels weak and rote. There is something predictable in both the jokes and the pathos.One of the differences between adults and children is that adults have seen it all before and children haven't. So for a child Boss Baby will be far less predictable and the jokes far more original. And since it's well animated, I think kids would probably like this.But if you're an adult, you're better off with Up, or Toy Story, or Giant Robot, or Spirited Away, or Despicable Me, or, really, a ton of movies that are more entertaining for the over-10 set.",The Boss Baby

14,lesleyharris30,"Average Plot, Albeit an Energetic Voice Cast,",5,9 June 2017,"The Boss Baby is a mediocre movie with a lackluster plot and a top notch voice cast. It's certainly an enjoyable flick, although definitely more so for kids. Alec Baldwin is stellar as the title character, adding a lot of humour with his masculine voice coming out of this little suit wearing baby. The film also has a surprisingly deep showcase of the jealously a first born can go through when a new child arrives and they are no longer getting the attention from their parents that they use to receive, it was actually quite profound. The film offers barely enough humour to keep adults happy. I assumed that Dreamworks would know at this stage that what makes the majority of their movies a financial and critical hit, such as Shrek and Madagascar, is that they have plenty for all age groups. Sadly, this movie only has, for the most part, jokes that will make kids laugh out loud. Steve Buscemi is wasted in this movie as Francis Francis. Likely casted as a result of his stellar work as the animated antagonist in Monsters Inc, he is given a very poor, underdeveloped villain here who is merely causing evil for the sake of it. His character is instantly forgettable and never makes a memorable contribution to this movie. Its a bit of fun while it lasts. An average animated movie with a voice cast that is too good for it, The Boss Baby is worth it if you have kids and want to get something to keep them quiet, as for an older audience, you are better off avoiding this. Jealous of his new baby brother, an imaginative young boy discovers the baby is more than the parents are perceiving him as.",The Boss Baby

16,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,16 July 2017,"The Boss BabyThe best time to ask your newborn boss for a raise is when you're changing their diaper.Unfortunately, the CEO in this animated family movie always has the advantage.Tim's (Tobey Maguire, Miles Bakshi) perfect life is disrupted when his parents (Lisa Kudrow, Jimmy Kimmel) have another child, Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin). Sharply dressed and keenly acute, the husky-voiced youngster informs Tim that he has been sent from elsewhere to turn the tide in the babies' battle against puppy popularity.But if Tim doesn't help stop the release of an everlasting puppy, Boss Baby will become his brother forever.An unsettling blend of low fertility rate propaganda, Loony Tune-esque sex education and smart mouthed infants, DreamWork's latest offering borrows too heavily from funnier sources. Although Baldwin's voice work is exceptional as always, nothing much else in this bizarre cartoon works. Besides, kids already know that all babies come from China.

17,ironhorse_iv,"Cookies are for winners, but this movie is not quite a winner. At least, it's not a stinky diaper. It was mostly fine.",6,12 April 2017,"I know, that some of you, will shake your rattle at me, because you really wanted me to hate on this movie, but don't be a big baby! The movie wasn't that bad. It deal with relatable real world issues, but through the lens of a wildly colorful and cartoonish fantasy. The animation from DreamWorks was amazing. The voice acting is wonderful and the music score by composter, Hans Zimmler & Steve Mazzaro was beautiful. It was mostly a well-rounded movie. Directed by Tom McGrath, and loosely based on a picture book of the same name by Marla Frazee. The film tells the story a young boy, Tim (Voiced by Miles Bakshi) having his life turned upside down, when his parents, Ted (Voiced by Jimmy Kimmel) & Janice (Voiced by Lisa Kudrow) decide to have a baby (Voiced by Alex Baldwin) who happens to wears a suit and carries a briefcase around. Without spoiling the movie, too much, for the most part, I like how the movie address the issues of sibling rivalry when it comes to the control of the love, from the parent & how much attention is demanded from a new born, however, I did think the film went a little too dark, in certain scenes. Seeing a kid go through a psychological breakdown, and try to kill a baby to win back, his parents seem a bit much. It was somewhat hard to watch, along with some slapstick confrontations between babies and adults. While, most of it is played for laughs. The nick-of-time peril might be, too much for younger viewers. The same, can be said with the mean-spirited cutthroat white collar corporation jokes that the film was going for. The unlikeable prideful tone of Alec Baldwin's imperious sounding voice does get old, pretty quick. However, I have to say, I'm glad, the movie isn't as obnoxious as the trailer, makes it out to be. Don't get me wrong, the 'Boss Baby' is still annoying and disturbing with how insults, the film uses; but there seem to be, some heart to the film as well. I like the character development between the main character & the baby. Seeing them; eventual affirmative to sibling bonding and familial love makes the film, a little bit more bearable. There is a clear message about the value of brotherhood and the fact that there is enough love for everyone in a family. As for the other ridiculous plot points of the movie where the Boss Baby is on a mission to infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co; in the secret war between babies and puppies for their love; it can be easily explained when you remember that the story's being told from the perspective of a 7-year old with an overactive imagination. There are a number of heighted reality scenes that makes us, wonder, if this was young Tim's way in dealing with the news, that his parents were having a baby. After all, it's seem to be, some moments that makes us, question if the Boss Baby was even born. It seems almost as if, indeed, we are supposed to believe that Tim is to some degree an Unreliable Narrator, which explains some of the crazier plot-holes stuff we see, later in the film, such as other babies being able to talk, despite not being boss babies, and adults remembering when they use to be, one. After all, there was scenes where Tim and the babies slams into a tree, vehicles blow up, only to find out, through his mother's POV that many of those interactions are quite possibly only in Tim's imagination. While, these scenes don't excuse the other jarring plot-holes of many scenes like the Elvis airport moment; it does help make, the film more surreal, unique, and downright ambiguous enough to keep the audiences, interesting in what's going on. After all, it could be all real or could be, just a story to inspire young children to accept change. The ending to this film was really surprising, regardless. Overall: You don't mind some toddler toilet humor & nudity—and some plot issues. The Boss Baby is a fun, if not instant-classic, movie that parents and kids can enjoy together. Like the opening tune to this movie. I'm in heaven. And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak; and I seem to find the happiness I seek.

18,Platypuschow,The Boss Baby: Predictably quaint,7,30 August 2017,"Alec Baldwin stars as the titular character of this much hyped Dreamworks animation and though it's not exactly going to blow anyone away it's an entertaining fluff piece.Predictably sappy, following the usual tropes of the genre and with the type of humour customary for these types of movies you can do a lot worse with 90 minutes.One thing I liked was just how much adult humour they got in, that kind of lightweight stuff to appease the parents watching these kind of films with their kids.The only shocking thing to come away from this is the fact the sequel isn't available until 2021! Fun stuff but don't expect any surprises.The Good: Quaint in that predictable way The Bad: Quaint in that predictable way Things I learnt from this movie: Puppies are evil Babies coming from women's vaginas is a false rumour (Never did sound right)",The Boss Baby
19,Reno-Rangan,The baby on a mission!,7,4 August 2017,"If you ask anybody from the pre 90s, they would say their love for animated feature started with 'Toy Story'. But mine was DreamWorks' 'Antz'. So this production house might not be as good as Disney or Pixar, but still a better one than the rest of those who are in the same business, except Sony who comes equal. I wanted this film to be good, yeah, it is a box office hit, but not critically. The regular animated film goer accepted it. And I think as well, it is entertaining, so much fun in parts, if not the entire film.The story of a boy whose happy life being an only child has taken away from his newborn little brother. Then one day he discovers the baby could speak and came to the house with a bigger plan. Knowing what it is and joining hands with him to tackle is what the remaining narration covers. Quite fun film. Animation, story and all the adventures were good. The voice-over was great. Alec Baldwin was awesome, but it's fair to praise the technicians, the animators.At first, I thought some of the jokes were rude, if the film is for families, particularly for the kids. But when I watched the rest of the film, it did not look going anymore worse. A simple story and predictable, but it was enjoyable, that makes you forget yourself for a while. Despite the mixed response in acceptance, I've heard the sequel is on, in a couple of years. I think it is a good decision, even the storyline, how it ended encourages that. It's not going to be your favourite animated film, but surely not to be missed if you love animation.7/10",The Boss Baby

22,Thanos_Alfie,Entertaining...,6,4 October 2021,"""The Boss Baby"" is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we watch a baby wearing a suit trying to stop the CEO of Puppy Corporation with the help of his 7-year old brother. They have to cooperate and work as a team if they want to succeed.I enjoyed this animation movie because it had many funny scenes, very good details and a nice plot. It was entertaining and the direction which was made by Tom McGrath was equally good. The use of Alec Baldwin's voice as Boss Baby was very accurate and fitted the role. In addition to this, the voices of both Steve Buscemi as Francis Francis and Tobey Maguire as Adult Tim / Narrator were very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Boss Baby"" is a nice animation movie to spend your time with and I strongly recommend it to parents with children.",The Boss Baby
23,Floated2,Overrated and overhyped,1,20 June 2019,"As a whole The Boss Baby was a big success ensuring the studios would greenlit a sequel. This film wasn't nearly as great or funny as advertised from trailers and from audience reviews and praise. Didn't have too high expectations but did expect some general funny moments. What was given, was a movie that's comedy felt forced, and with annoying characters (mainly the boy) and an unusual plot (it was different- but also predictable)There have been theories about this film's ending and the entire concept (that the entire thing was a dream and such- which would explain why the parents aren't very smart), but as a film, the Boss Baby just isn't funny, clever or amusing. For a relatively short movie, it is quite boring and has a ""preachy"" tone about it. Understand it is a children's film but did not enjoy. Also am surprised how big this movie became (making $527 million worldwide), and how it was able to snag an Oscar nomination.",The Boss Baby
24,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,4,2 May 2017,"This movie didn't feel any different from the other anime movies out there. Sure, the sibling dynamics were good, as well as the family values, the childhood memories and older brother anxiety. The main idea was interesting, with the new baby seeming rather like a boss sent into the family to spy on the parents and solve a big problem for his company. You can't help but identify with the older kid, especially if you have younger siblings. But eventually, the action was a bit main stream. The action scenes were not original and kind of boring. Other than that, the story became a little complicated when you start to think about what's real and what's not. The narration was good and the animation was nice, with the cute babies and puppies. So, 4 out of 10.",The Boss Baby
25,Rectangular_businessman,Awful beyond belief. Even Bee Movie was better.,1,25 August 2017,"For those viewers that think that movies like ""Minions"" or ""Sing"" appeal to the lowest common denominator, I only have to say that ""The Boss Baby"" somehow managed to lower the bar for mainstream animation to unthinkable levels.I miss the days when DreamWorks made great films like ""The Prince of Egypt."" And while some of their CGI films are definitely fun and very enjoyable to watch, ""The Boss Baby"" is definitely not one of them.Since the very first trailer, this movie seemed like a cringe-worthy experience beyond belief. The only reason of why I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt (Big mistake) was because many other animated movies tend to have awful trailers but most of them turn out to be not so bad. Some of them turn out to be actually good, but ""The Boss Baby"" turned out to be just as bad as it seemed to be in every trailer.The only positive aspect of this film was the animation style (Despite some rather questionable character designs) which was cute and reasonably well made, but sadly the visual aspect of this film wasn't enough to distract me from the awfulness of the script and its terrible jokes.Compared with this, a show like ""Rugrats"" is Shakespeare-worthy material. This might be the worst effort done by DreamWorks Animation to date, and the fact that is getting a sequel should be enough indication to explain why stuff like ""The Emoji Movie"" ends being made.",The Boss Baby
26,leonblackwood,Funny in places! 5/10,5,17 September 2017,"Review: I did quite enjoy this funny animated movie, which is fun for the whole family but it did get a bit silly after a while. It's about a 7 year old boy, Tim, who is spoilt by his parents, until they adopt a baby, who arrives with a suit and a briefcase. As the baby is getting all of the attention, Tim decides to investigate the babies strange behaviour, and he hears him talking on the phone about a secret mission. The baby then cuts a deal with Tim, to help him take down Puppy Co., who wants to make puppies take over from babies, and then he will leave and go back to the company. While they are trying to solve the case, they become close friends and they risk there lives to save the world. There are some funny moments, especially from the Boss Baby, voiced by Alec Baldwin but I was expecting more. The animation looked great and the fast paced concept will be a hit with children but from an adults point of view, it's pretty average. Don't get me wrong, the little baby did crack me up in places, and it did make a hell of a profit at the box office but it lacked wit once they became buddies. It still worth a watch, especially on a family day out, and I'm sure the sequel will smash the box office. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Tom McGrath, 53, who also directed all 3 of the Madagascar movies and Megamind, so he was the perfect choice for this movie. He is also due to direct Rentaghost, which I used to watch as a kid, so I hope he doesn't make a mess of the movie. With so many animated movies coming out recently, he done well by creating something fresh and original, which will keep the kids quiet for an hour and a half, so I can't wait to see what they do with Boss Baby 2, which isn't due for release until 2021.Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $500millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/family/comedies, voiced by Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy Kinmel, Lisa Kudrow, Tobey Maguire and James McGrath. 5/10",The Boss Baby
27,TheMovieDiorama,The Boss Baby is unable to balance infancy and adulthood.,5,24 March 2018,"After the first few minutes, it sprung into my mind that this was incredibly similar to 'Storks'. Imaginatively illustrating where babies come from to create an entertaining animation. What's different with this iteration is that it attempts to blend the lifestyle of a manager with a cute toddler, but doesn't always hit the target. Tim is welcomed by a baby brother who turns out to be a literate boss baby that was hired by a company to prevent people from loving puppies more than babies. A rather creative concept, to mix the stressful life of an office worker with the inadequacy of infancy. It's humorous for the first few minutes, to then stretch the idea for a whole first act before establishing a coherent story grew tedious extremely quickly. Memos, briefcases, money, charts, we get it...it's a baby who bosses people around wearing managerial attire. Baldwin was perfect voice casting for the boss baby whose dead pan delivery sparks the occasional snigger. Yet he is only a small percentage of the voice acting pie chart that I would class as memorable, everyone else was simply just functional. The primary animation style was fine, nothing outstanding, however the style changes when Tim's overly imaginative perspective kicks in to differentiate fantasy from reality. Also liked the pop-up book expositional scene which showcases some innovative animation. The constant film references ('Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Mary Poppins', 'Lord of the Rings' etc.) may have peaked my interest initially but the overuse of them became detrimental to the comedic script as it rapidly descends into uninspired laziness. The antagonist and primary plot were forgettable and strangely felt pushed aside to focus on developing the relationship between Tim and the boss baby. Fortunately, the last ten minutes pulled in some much needed emotion and rounded the flick off nicely. It's most certainly not the worst animation I've seen, but it feels both imaginative and bland simultaneously. The Elvis impersonators cracked me up though!",The Boss Baby
28,lisafordeay,A silly funny animated comedy from the man that brought you Megamind,6,3 April 2017,"The Boss Baby is the latest Dreamworks Animated feature and stars Alec Baldwin(Rise Of The Guardians),Tobey Maguire(Spiderman),Lisa Kudrow(Friends)and Jimmy Kimmel(TV host of Jimmy Kimmel Show)and tells the tale of a 7 year old boy named Tim(voiced in adult form by Tobey Maguire)who has a vivid imagination. His an only child and both his parents(voiced by Kudrow and Kimmel)are over a company called Puppy Co,where they are big in selling puppies. Meanwhile during the opening credits of this film we see a bunch of babies who are being sent to our world. Some go to Management,others go to Families. One baby in particular ends up in Management and is sent on a mission to find out about Puppy Co who is owned by a well off businessman(voiced by Steven Bushchei)and is trying to take over the world. So the baby ends up with Tim's parents,but Tim thinks the baby is weird because he wears a business suit,is extremely bossy and behaves like an adult. Turns out Tim is right as the baby IS able to talk and act like a human(voiced by Alec Baldwin)and is dubbed The Boss Baby. He explains to Tim that he was sent here for Puppy Co(as I have mentioned)and needs Tim's help to try and stop the wealthy businessman who is trying to get rid of all babies so that adults can buy puppies instead. But will The Boss Baby ever become an ordinary baby and dispose of his magical drinking formula that makes him behave like an adult.Now I know what you are thinking the premise is stupid,and your right the premise to this film is stupid but let me tell you, I actually thought it was a funny film. Alec Baldwin was hilarious as the baby who can talk like an adult and behave like an adult,there were certain scenes that had me and my family laughing. The story has been done before think of it as Baby Geniuses(but not as bad as that)and Stewie from Family Guy and you pretty much get The Boss Baby. The animation is very nice and everything else was fine.If you got kids and they wanna watch a fun cartoon then take them to see it I am sure they will love it. As for me I liked it too,yes I wasn't the target audience for this film but still as a lover for animation and I am in my late 20s I say go and watch it. 3.5/5",The Boss Baby
29,subxerogravity,"Simple generic animation, but I really like how the story was told.",6,1 April 2017,"When I first herd about The Boss Baby I did not think I would like it, despite the trailer showing me just how funny Alec Baldwin was going to be in it. It just did not sound like the best animated feature Dreamworks could possibly do, but as it turns out, Boss Baby is real enjoyable, mostly because of the story over the animation. Baldwin plays The Boss Baby, a middle management exec for Babycorp (That delivers babies to the world), sent undercover as Tim's brand new baby brother, in an attempt to stop puppies from cornering the market on cute, (Which has decrease the production of infants) by stopping the manufacturing of the ultimate Puppy.What's so good about The Boss Baby is how they work it in that the purpose of the film is Tim using his imagination to adjust to a new baby coming into the house that he once alone had the love and attention of both parents all to himself. A very uniquely done animated film, if not the best animated film. Just a great children story on children. Reminds me of Pixar's Inside Out.Very funny and entertaining.http://cinemagardens.com",The Boss Baby

Jimmy and Lisa are the parents of a 7 year old child who has gotten used to having all of their attention directed towards him. Things change when a new addition to the family shows up, Alec. But, there is more to Alec than meets the eye, and it's not just in the way that he likes to wear a suit. Tobey is the narrator of the movie and also voices the adult 7 year old child, Tim. Besides the conflict of the two brothers fighting for the attention of their parents, there is a separate plot line about Steve trying to get people to be more puppy enthusiasts instead of having babies-it involves creating a new breed of puppy that never grows up. FYI: There is a scene after the end credits start and one after the very end of the credits, too, so you might want to stay.

32,drqshadow-reviews,"Despite a Few Inspired Moments, This Baby Never Grows Into Something Greater",4,19 April 2017,"Seven-year-old Tim is crestfallen when his idyllic family unit is shattered by a shrewd, suit-wearing, latte-draining infant brother with ulterior motives. It's a silly-thin premise, really, even for a kids' movie, but one that has a few ups to go with its downs. It's very well art-directed, for one, with Tim's wildly colorful, elaborate fantasies wrenched to life in a variety of rich, vibrant, mix-and-match styles. Sight gags are also a strength, in true Dreamworks fashion, with one absurdly over-the-top backyard brawl taking that particular cake. The celebrity voice acting is hit and miss: Alec Baldwin is a home run as the titular toddler, but Jimmy Kimmel drags down an essential role as the boys' soulful, stretched-thin father. The story, too, grapples with big problems. It makes a nasty habit of establishing supporting characters and then forgetting about them for an awkward length of time, and also suffers from long stretches of bland exposition that drag the plot to a standstill. Though it strives to connect with audiences of all ages, spitting adult-directed one-liners and references at every opportunity, many feel forced and out of place, like the obnoxious uncle who keeps trying to work in a ""that's what she said"" at the family picnic. Simple, narrow and predictable to the last, it'll make good fodder for early weekend mornings, in households where sleepy parents seek something loud and shiny to sleep through.",The Boss Baby

34,Kdosda_Hegen,One of the best and underrated animated movies ever.,9,15 June 2020,"Behold, one of the best animated films of all time.I think that storyline concept is extremely original and well thought-out. It's one of the most complicated and unique universes I've ever seen. Even better than The Matrix or Inception.I've even watched the whole animated series of it. All 4 seasons. It was all so interesting besides the series have amazing finales in each season. The lore of The Boss Baby universe is very interesting.There's tons of symbolism. All the corporation ideologies and corruption of our society is done well. All the showcases of 60s and 70s culture and hints to real-life events of a time are pure genius. All the Babycorp ideas make sense and all this never-ending war for love is truly a superb concept. Also all the symbolism that baby being a Boss and taking over a house does reflect real life a lot.I love the humor. It was hilarious, yet doesn't completely rely on jokes.It is an extremely relatable film to me. Tim is an exact copy of me when I was his age (personality) it was like seeing myself. He plays a lot with his imagination, he's very naive and his best friend Danny Petrosky is also an exact copy of one of my best friends. Jimbo also feels identical to one of my real-life friends. And The Boss Baby himself is an exact copy of my brother and his and Tim's relationship is just like my and my own brother relationship. Everything about brotherhood was portrayed so well, all the struggles and annoyances and all the fun and feel of love and trust. I also hated my brother at first just like Tim hated Boss Baby at first but with time we found compromises in our relationship and with years we became you know like real brothers. We share a pretty strong bond to this day.The Boss Baby is the only film about the brotherhood that portrays it in this detailed way. It's a film I never asked for but it's everything I've ever wanted out of brotherhood film.It's important to note that in this film both brothers are enemies at first, but they learn from each other to improve on themselves. Tim learns to be an adult from Theodore, while Theodore learns to be a kid from Tim.Also, the animation is awesome, keeps changing between multiple styles of 3D and 2D and has some interesting colour palette choices.Also, this film has dozens of references and easter eggs. So many quotes and parodies of other movies and popular culture. The best reference is definitely to Glengarry Glen Ross when The Boss baby which is voiced by Alec Baldwin says a very similar quote to the one that Alec Baldwin's character says in Glengarry Glen Ross and in both films the ideas behind the quote are almost identical, yet under completely different circumstances. Just pure brilliance of the writing.Now taking it to a bit semi-spoiler territory. The film can be interpreted to infinity and beyond. Anything that you see can be considered being either real or Tim's imagination, there are tons of subtle details that support both claims, that all that's happening is real and that all that's happening is just an imagination.Sadly, after rewatching I did notice a few problems with this film. It is quite filled with plot holes. Like how does Francis remembers his baby days, according to the lore all babies forget everything once they turn into ""preeks"". Also, the mother's pregnancy is just weird, I know that according to the lore parents just pick up the new babies from the baby shelter, but I guess her pregnancy could be interpreted just as being Tim's imagination. Also, another problem I have with this film is that Tim's parents are such bland characters, they feel like shells only. I know that the majority of adults are stupid in The Boss Baby's universe, but some are smart and self-aware, so why do most of them have to be almost braindead I cannot understand. Also, I wish that Jimbo's, Stacy's and Triplets' characters would have been more fleshed out, but at least they got much more characterisation in the series.Overall, The Boss Baby is a flawed but brilliant animated film.",The Boss Baby

He is the Boss Baby and his movie is the focus of this review. Hi fans, Robbie K is back again with another review, and this time on the latest animation movie to hit the silver screen. What does this animated feature film have in store? I'm happy to share some thoughts on the subject, so why don't we get started shall we? LIKES:  Good animation  Cute  Unique Twist on a story  Incredibly Fun  Funny and Clever  Movie ReferencesSummary: As you saw in the trailers, Boss Baby is another example of how incredible our animation technology is and this time it is wrapped up in a cute as a button package. This film may be one of the most adorable animation pieces to hit this year, and many will fall in love with the whimsical charm of this film. Now that we have the obvious wrapped up let us get to the real gold of this film. It's difficult to find a unique twist on a story, but the risk taken with Boss Baby's story was well executed. The tale has many layers to it involving adapting to new family members, pursuit of your dreams, and of course what is better babies or puppies. With surprising detail and character development, the story is very entertaining and fun as baby and brother try to stop the dastardly puppies from taking over. And the best part is the whole adventure is fun and fast paced, with seldom a boredom moment in this fast-moving flick. Let's hit the comedy now. Boss Baby again excels in this aspect providing a variable mix of comedic styles to entertain all ages. Young (and young at heart) will enjoy the simplistic comedy that involves the characters dropping mindless (meme-worthy) one liners, various screams of fear, and dopey run-ins with a wall. The real comedic diamonds though are the cleverer puns, one-liners, and adult references hidden in this movie. Alec Baldwin's sarcastic delivery and edginess worked for me, adding just the right touches to maximize the laughs. Yet, I'm a sucker for all the movie references integrated into this plot and how key they were to the adventure. And if you are nerd like me, you may get an extra thrill keeping your eye out for the next reference. DISLIKES:  Predictable  A bit of a stretch  A little preachy at times  More Babycorp use  Better EditingSummary: Despite how much I enjoyed the story, much of it is still predictable. Boss Baby has some surprising twists, but no manner of fun, can hide the blatantly obvious ending that is to come. While predictability is difficult to avoid, Boss Baby could have tidied things up a bit to give the finale a little more flare. In addition, they could have worked hard to not be so preachy near the end about the importance of family and all that lovey-dovey mush that animation films do all the time. Let's talk about some developmental issues I had with the movies. First off, the movie has moments that are a bit of a stretch. Yes, I know this movie is ridiculous and a stretch to begin with, but hear me out. Boss Baby's adult cast are a bit idiotic at best, somehow not hovering over the newborns to hear them speaking. If that wasn't enough, some of the more dangerous stunts involved were also not as ""noticeable"", which after some point should have been discovered. Although fun, this ridiculousness didn't fit so much into the grand scheme of the plot. Next up is Babycorp, the organization the boss baby works for. This large plot point has dramatic build up and gets a large sequence to explain the wonders of this magnificent corporation. Yet after that, the film fails to deliver more on the potential plot points that could have come with it. Had the trailers not built up the baby vs. puppy rivalry as they did, I could have let this go, but with all the advertising I would have liked to see more of this. Finally, the editing of the movie. Boss Baby has a lot of great parts that foster imagination, love, and all those positive qualities we love in an animated movie. However, much of these moments were not necessary, often just extending the run time under the guise of character development. While I don't think they needed to eliminate these parts (after all it is only 90 minutes), they certainly could have altered these scenes to be a little more relevant to the adventure. The VERDICT:Despite all the lower scores, Boss Baby was an entertaining spectacle that is fun, funny, and clever at many points. This movie is certainly adorable and is the perfect family film (for all ages) to hit the screen this year. Yes, it is simplistic and silly, and doesn't have as much magic as a Disney film, but it's nice to have unique, story that doesn't involve making a political ordeal out of it. This reviewer recommends this one for the theater for group outings and those with kids, but definitely check this one out when it hits homes. My scores are: Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",The Boss Baby
40,invisibleunicornninja,Very stupid.,6,19 December 2018,"The only reason I'm giving this movie such a high rating is because the animation is really good. While it doesn't go as over-the-top as I was expecting, but its still visually pretty great. Not that I'd expect anything less from Dreamworks at this point.The story, however, is nonsensical. It doesn't get to a point where its so ridiculous that its funny, but some jokes land. There are an unnecessary number of scenes containing naked babies but it could've been worse.I would not recommend this movie under any circumstances, but its not the worst thing that you could be watching.",The Boss Baby
41,rannynm,"Fun, lighthearted with extraordinary performance from Alec Baldwin",9,24 March 2017,"Dreamworks' The Boss Baby, is an extraordinary, fun and lighthearted animated film based on an award-winning picture book by Marla Frazee. 7-year-old Tim (Miles Christopher Bakshi) had the perfect life and the full attention of his parents until one day, a new arrival took it all away and became the Boss of his family. Tim and Boss Baby face sibling rivalry, trying to both win the affection of their parents. Much to Tim's surprise, the two bond when they join forces to uncover the evil plot of the CEO of Puppy Co. And in the midst of it all, Tim and his new brother Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) learn the true meaning of the love of family.The Boss Baby is fabulously directed by Tom McGrath, who you might recognize from his work on all three Madagascar movies and Megamind. He says that the movie is partially an apology letter to his own brother for all the grief he put him in when they were young.My favorite character is Boss Baby. Alec Baldwin voices this character with great panache. His witty personality mixed with a take-charge attitude bursts through the screen. I feel that Baldwin's voice talent in this is one of the key reasons this movie shines. My favorite scene is when Tim and Boss Baby work together to sneak into Puppy Co. and attempt to steal the secret file. Watching a working large scale replica of one of my favorite games when I was young (Mouse Trap) was particularly fun. Also, there are many toys from the 70s and 80s included which I enjoyed. Several times I found myself times trying to find them in the scene. There are so many magical moments throughout. As an only child, it's funny that there are times the movie made me want to have a brother and, other times, I'm happy to be an only child.The Boss Baby is an enjoyable film safe to keep you and your family thoroughly entertained. Director Tom McGrath states ""I want this movie to draw you in and make you move to the edge of your seat, not pull away from the screen"" and I believe he achieved that goal. It is rated PG for mild humor and I recommend it for ages 6 to 14, although the whole family will enjoy it. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars.

43,bkrauser-81-311064,Entertaining...,7,2 April 2017,"""Put the cookie down! Cookies are for closers."" It seems this entire movie is created around that one joke. I mean, has there ever been any question that anyone other than Alec Baldwin could have sold the high concept of a cutthroat, suit wearing, and management oriented baby? What other voice would have struck the right balance between referentially satisfying and patently absurd? Gary Cole? Of course the film's reference to Baldwin's character in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) is twenty-five years old and at times that's how stale some of the film's gags feel. Luckily for the movie and its intended audience, the premise is grounded in its sweetly irreverent narrative told from the perspective of a seven-year-old boy.Timmy (Bakshi) is a stereotypical cartoon movie child. He's precocious, easily identifiable, humorously naïve, charismatic and imaginative to the point of coming up with elaborate hijinks on the fly to further the plot. In fact, the only difference between him and Elliott from E.T. (1982) is he actually gets all the attention he craves from his doting parents (Kimmel and Kudrow), complete with a regular five story, four hug and one song bedtime special. That is until The Boss Baby (Baldwin) arrives with his briefcase full of memos on a mission from the aptly named Baby Corp. After a time squabbling, Timmy and the Boss Baby team up to uncover a mass conspiracy involving their parents' employer, a late addition villain (Buscemi) and puppies who have apparently been stealing all the love.The inner-mechanics of Boss Baby's world is riddled with holes, pacing issues and confusion but because the entire story is being told by an adult Timmy (Maguire) recollecting his interpretation of events, it never seems to matter. It rather allows the film to truly revel in some creative slapsticky moments of goofy fun young children are primed to enjoy. There are plenty of Loony Tune-esque chase sequences, quickly-paced flights of fancy, playful sight-gags and plenty and I mean plenty of butt related jokes. It may prove a little repetitive for attentive parents but considering the prime demographic is going to be darting back and forth between bathroom-breaks it's not like parents of young children will mind.Of course telling the entire yarn from Timmy's POV proves a double-edged sword at times. The film goes through great pains to deliver the stakes needed to elevate its one-joke premise. But since the emotional arc of the story is all but written in stone from the first act, all of the tension feels hollow and redundant. We're seeing what amounts to a holiday free A Christmas Story (1983) with a talking baby. Yet while that movie ruminates on ""an interesting Christmas"" this movie asks; ""will our two heroes wind up being brothers."" Bereft of any real consequence, The Boss Baby winds up being a mildly entertaining family-oriented feature with a couple of good sigh-gags and some pretty outdated jokes. The larger message is just uncommon enough for tacit approval though I'm a little worried some kids might figure out alternative uses for baby bungee bouncers. As a younger brother myself I'm surprised I lasted this long with my siblings in the house.",The Boss Baby
44,moviexclusive,"Never fully expanding on the promise of its appealing conceit, 'The Boss Baby' is typical hijinks-driven entertainment, despite boasting a pitch-perfect Alec Baldwin",6,23 March 2017,"Loosely based on Marla Frazee's 2010 picture book of the same name, 'The Boss Baby' pits a seven-year-old boy named Tim against his arrogant, manipulative and precocious walking-and-talking baby brother. Wait, did we say walking and talking? Oh yes, this titular infant is no ordinary baby; dubbed the Boss Baby from start to finish, he wears a suit and tie and carries a tiny briefcase wherever he goes. That's because he happens to be an ambitious management executive from the baby-making organization known as Baby Corp, whose deliberate entry into the Templetons' family is really for cover to infiltrate arch-rival company Puppyco and stop their newest invention – the ne'er-grow-old 'Forever Puppy' – that threatens to further divert humans' affection (presumed to be finite) away from babies. If all that sounds a little far-fetched, you're absolutely right; in fact, these events are happening inside the mind of a wildly imaginative only child, who concocts this elaborate scenario as an analogy of how his newborn sibling is usurping the time, attention and love of his parents.Because most of it happens inside Tim's head (who narrates the story as an adult voiced by Tobery Maguire), director Tom McGrath (co- director of the three 'Madagascar' movies) and screenwriter Michael McCullers (Mike Myers' co-writer on the second and third 'Austin Powers' movies) get plenty of leeway to let their own imagination run wild. That includes conceiving conception as coming off an assembly line, where babies are diapered, powdered and sorted into 'Family' or 'Management' depending on how they respond to stimuli. That also involves throwing corporate politics into the mix, where the Boss Baby's mission success decides whether he gets promoted to CEO, upgrades to a huge office of his own complete with a private toilet, and joins the ranks of his idol 'Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby'. And last but not least, that culminates in the foiling of a dastardly plot hatched by Puppyco's CEO, Francis E. Francis (Steve Buscemi), to flood every corner of the world with his 'Forever Puppys' packed into a rocket ready for launch.The late introduction of Francis E. Francis shifts the proceedings into hyperdrive, and like 'Penguins of Madagascar' or 'The Croods', delivering loud frenetic action becomes the priority in the third and final act. From the point Tim and the Boss Baby sneak into Puppyco's company headquarters on 'Bring Your Kids to Work' Day, it is one non-stop action sequence after another as the unlikely duo evade Francis' henchman within their suburban neighbourhood en route to the airport, smuggle on board a plane full of Elvis impersonators bound for Vegas, and stop the rocket countdown from a Vegas convention centre before the 'Forever Puppies' overrun the globe. All that feverish to-and-fro comes at the expense of heart, humour or even neglecting the simple truth behind all that fantasy, i.e. that Tim's just plain terrified that he is being replaced – and that not even a supposedly heartwarming resolution that has Tim finally embrace his baby brother and the latter 'family-hood' can compensate for.In fact, it is the earlier two – and much simpler – acts that have much more meaning and laughs. An earlier sequence that pits Tim against the Boss Baby and his other Baby Corp spies in the vicinity to the theme music from that 70s TV show 'S.W.A.T.' is a lot more entertaining and inventive than the concluding melee. Even more inspired is that which introduces us to Baby Corp, centred not just on a revisionist explanation of where babies come from but also why the Boss Baby was not like most of the others bound for domestication from the beginning. There are other amusing touches of wit – such as how the Boss Baby gives a virtual tour of Baby Corp by asking Tim to suck aggressively on a special pacifier or how the Boss Baby delivers himself to the Templetons by taxi and funk waddling up the doorstep or even Tim's daily escapist adventures that turn dinner into a hunt through the Congo, daily baths into an undersea mission to save his parents from inside the jaws of a shark and his alarm clock into a Gandalf wizard wannabe named Wizzy.But a big reason for the Boss Baby's sheer hilarity is none other than Alec Baldwin's flawless voice delivery, this being the fifth time he's lending his signature deadpan to an animated movie. Perfectly capturing the eponymous character's infantilism, brashness, egotism, insecurity and affection, Baldwin brings the man-child to vivid life, nailing the punchlines and even elevating some of the less clever puns. Indeed, it is hardly a stretch to say that Baldwin is the film's standout element, its primary source of cheer, exuberance and wackiness, and quite simply the one reason that makes it worth catching.The basic premise of 'The Boss Baby' is undeniably an appealing and relatable one: the anxiety, uncertainty and even fear that a child faces when he is no longer the only kid in the family, especially given the demands and concessions that a newborn places on his or her parents' time. Turning that into a vivid fantasy with the newborn becoming a literal 'boss' not just of the family but also of an entire baby-making operation that views puppies as their number one enemy sounds ingenious, but the execution through hijinks-driven slapstick gags ultimately reduces it to generic hyperactive fare that too many animated comedies these days are guilty of. And by that same measure, 'The Boss Baby' has little distinction from the average cartoon, despite being admittedly beautifully visualized, cheerfully executed and boasting the top-notch voice talent of Alec Baldwin. It may be about a baby all right, but that hardly excuses why it has to resort to the attention span of one.",The Boss Baby
45,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Boss Baby""- Surprisingly amusing and heartwarming despite what the lackluster advertising suggested. Not perfect, but it'll win over kids and give parents a few laughs.",7,6 August 2017,"If there ever was a prime example of the old idiom ""Don't judge a book by its cover"", that would certainly be Dreamworks' 2017 release ""The Boss Baby,"" directed by Tom McGrath and inspired by the picture book of the same name by Marla Franzee. With sharp, strong animated visuals and a general abundance of both humor and heart, the film is for all intents and purposes charming enough that it will certainly win over its targeted audience of young children, while providing a few laughs here and there for their parents. Which is a far-cry from how it was portrayed in the frankly atrocious previews and trailers that littered cinemas in the months leading up to its release. It's just unfortunate that a few clichés and a very weak first act make it fall flat a bit too often for it to be called anything more than ""pretty good, but not great.""We follow narrator Timothy Templeton (Miles Bakshi/Tobey Maguire) as he tells the story of how he first met his baby brother Theodore (Alec Baldwin) back when he was a seven-year-old. Feeling neglected with his parents' attention almost exclusively held by Theodore, Timothy eventually learns a startling truth- Theodore, who prefers to be called ""Boss Baby"", can not only talk, but is also a super- intelligent representative of a mysterious company that is dispatching other like-minded newborns to families the world over. Their goal- to try to figure out why all of the love (the most powerful force in the world) that babies formerly held has suddenly been shifting more and more towards puppies. And it may have to do with a nefarious pet-store corporation that Timothy's parents (Jimmy Kimmel/Lisa Kudrow) work for...That sounds absolutely ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it actually kind of works. The film is at its best after it gets all the prerequisite and predictable ""Wow, that baby acting like an adult sure looks funny!"" jokes out of the way and instead is able to focus more on the central plot. A central plot which is so completely nuts, it actually ends up being pretty charming in its own cartoony way. The film thankfully seems to recognize how thin the gimmick of baby with an adult mind is, and compensates with some good heartwarming moments and plenty of fun action and adventure beats that will delight both children and adults alike. I also enjoyed the fact that the movie does make an actual effort to build something of a mystery to be solved by our lead characters. And I'll admit, even as a man pushing thirty, there were a few good twists and turns along the way that I didn't always see coming. Which is no small feat for a film aimed at young children.The film's voice cast is fantastic, and lend a lot to the proceedings, elevating what could have been merely a passable movie into one I'd comfortably recommend. Alec Baldwin does indeed steal the show as ""Boss Baby"", and it comes across in his voice that he seems to be having some fun with the role. He's very animated in his delivery (no pun intended) and gives a lot of ""oomph"" to the performance that helps define the character beyond the gimmick. I also really enjoyed Mike Bakshi and Tobey Maguire, who perform the same character in Timothy- Bakshi portraying the voice of Timothy as a child, while Maguire provides narration for him as an adult. Timothy is likable and daring, and both actors help drive this home. Kimmel and Kudrow are a good bit of fun, as are some supporting roles played by the likes of Steve Buscemi and Conrad Vernon. This is aided by some sharp visuals thanks to director McGrath, in addition to the absolutely gorgeous animation provided by Dreamworks. All around, it's a very competent movie.Unfortunately, it is brought down a few pegs with some very wonky moments, particularly early on. The first act of the film is the messiest and can often feel like it's dragging on and on and on... It's where the movie loads up all the jokes you'd expect, and it is bore as a result. Everything in the god-awful trailers? That's all loaded into the first twenty or so minutes. It can feel a little overpowering, which is a shame, because the movie does pick up the pace almost immediately when the second act rolls around. But that first act is... bad. I also did have some issues with how much the film is a slave to cliché despite the delightfully bizarre story- you can typically guess what's coming and it does hurt the movie at times. I know that's maybe not fair to complain about in a kid's movie... but it bothered me.But those are not enough to ruin an otherwise surprisingly thoughtful and engaging little movie that boasts good humor and heart to boot. The cast is absolutely fantastic, the visuals mind- bending, and the plot so silly you can't help but have some fun with it. ""The Boss Baby"" doesn't come close to matching the high quality of Dreamworks' best films... but it's a worthy addition to their filmography and is significantly better than I'd have thought it would be. And so, I give ""The Boss Baby"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Kids will love it, and parents will like it.",The Boss Baby
46,valadas,Technically good but silly story,6,26 April 2017,"Yes in terms of animation, puppet characters and face expressions it is very good indeed. However this is serving a rather silly story of a supposed new baby that arrives in a taxi, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase to the home of a couple who has already a seven year old son. We soon see that the newcomer is no ordinary baby (he thinks and talks like an adult). He is a spy involved in a struggle between babies' and puppies' organizations. The relationship between the boss baby and his ""brother"" begins to be very quarrelsome but as time passes it improves a lot more friendly with the both working together in the fight for babies and against puppies.

SERIOUSLY?!?!,3,8 March 2018,"Boss Baby is an inherently cynical film by nature; it's a film that has no real purpose to exist other than to simply serve itself as a product for kids to consume. It's got no 'oh-my-god-that's-genius' moments or any real characterization: it's a montage of non-coherent randomness that's got all the ADD that made Minions a hit with late-millennial kids in the first place. DreamWorks has made some pretty damn good animated films over the years: Shrek 1 & 2, Kung-Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon 1 & 2, those are all REALLY solid films. Where the hell does Boss Baby fit into that studio-spectrum? It's very near rock-bottom for the studio, right next to Shark Tale. It's bad.The premise sucks: babies in a 'cute-war' with puppies (puppies are way for me), the animation is actually pretty good, but everything outside of it and Alec Baldwin is pretty sub-par; the direction is clueless in moderating its MANY conflicting styles, and it's just fodder to be meme'd to oblivion on YouTube.

52,phubbs,The Boss Baby,6,19 July 2017,"Holy crap another movie adaptation of a children's book, picture book. This has to be one of the most bizarre premises I've come across for a children's book in some time, well at least until the end where all is somewhat explained.So basically you've got this family of three, mum dad and their little boy Tim. Tim is as happy as can be with his life because he gets lots of love and attention from his parents. But things take a turn for the worst when his mum and dad have a baby. Much to Tim's amazement the baby arrives in a taxi, wears a suit, and he can talk. Almost straight away the baby throws Tim's life into disarray without his parents noticing.It turns out that the baby (called 'the boss') is actually a baby but works for a mysterious company called Baby Corp. Here all babies have the minds of adults and work to keep infant love at a good level. Basically when people are born some are sent to their families but others that show a different state of mind are held back to work for Baby Corp, or something like that. These adult minded babies have to drink a special formula that keeps them as babies forever, if they stop they will grow old. Meanwhile, all other babies that go to their families, do retain memories of Baby Corp though their pacifier (dummy). But when that pacifier is eventually taken away (by the parents) they lose those memories. Utterly bizarre I know.This premise raises many questions though. Does this mean that all the babies in Baby Corp are immortal? Surely it does because if they never stop drinking the formula they never grow older. Where is Baby Corp suppose to be exactly? When a baby is held back to work for Baby Corp, what happens with the family expecting that baby? Its also mentioned at one point by Tim that his parents told him where babies come from. But as Boss baby points out that is incorrect, so how come adults have never noticed the fact that no one gives birth? I guess you could say I'm reading into this too much, but these questions do kinda spring out at you.Lets look at the villain. This guy used to be one of Baby Corps top babies, but apparently he was lactose intolerant so the special formula didn't work properly on him and he grew up. OK fair enough, but how come he can still remember Baby Corps? I thought babies lose that memory without their pacifier. Was it different for him because he used to be a CEO of Baby Corp or because he had been using the special formula or something??I must admit the plot behind this movie was way more convoluted than I ever imagined. I just assumed it would be about a baby that acts like an adult behind its parents backs, kinda like an animated 'Look Who's Talking' type thing. I mean the casting of Alec Baldwin was a good move that's for sure. If there's anyone who has the perfect temperament for being a suit trapped in a babies body, its Alec Baldwin. Hell Baldwin is intimidating enough just by looking at his face, he constantly has that angry dad expression on his face, the scary boss with a short fuse. So spot on voice casting there.Visually the movie is a treat but that's nothing new these days. But what I did find more interesting were the short imagination sequences that Tim has when he's playing. These sequences had a different, more simplified artistic style (kinda reminiscent of some old WB cartoons) with a much more vibrant, almost neon, colour palette. It was these sequences that I found to be way more intriguing and enjoyable than the rest of the actual movie. I especially liked the artistic style and colours used, really bold and striking. Other positive moments I can mention, a nice little 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' homage, and even more bizarrely a homage to the old classic kids board game 'Mouse Trap' (80's kids will know of this). Where on earth did that come from??So yeah, its pretty to look at, the voice acting is solid and its amusing in places. I liked it when Tim was battling with the baby, from his parents point of view its seeing the duo merely playing, but its actually a battle. The sequence in the back garden with the pedal car is the perfect example of that. In general its a very average outing really (with a peculiar plot). A standard modern CGI kids flick with all the right boxes ticked.6/10",The Boss Baby

55,dave-mcclain,"""The Boss Baby"" is pretty creative and a lot of fun!",8,31 March 2017,"I learned something important about children right after my newborn baby girl came home from the hospital. That first night, she slept like well, like a baby. My two-year-old cried like one. He was uncharacteristically restless, up and down all night, while his sister seemed perfectly content (for that first night anyway). Having a second child in the home is tough to get used to – especially for the first child. To that firstborn, it can suddenly seem like absolutely everything has changed and that the new arrival is now more important than anything or anyone else. When the new baby suddenly seems to be getting all the attention and when his or her every cry is answered immediately and every whim is catered to, that baby can seem to be the boss. It's that phenomenon, which parents with more than one child know so well, that formed the basis for a 2010 children's book by American author/illustrator Marla Frazee, and the animated feature film that the book inspired, 2017's ""The Boss Baby"" (PG, 1:37).Tim (voiced by Miles Bakshi) is a typical 7-year-old. He has an active imagination, he loves to play with his parents and he's happy. He's happy with the way everything in his life is. Right now. Today. But that all changes when his parents (Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow) step out of a taxi cab, enter the family home, and introduce Tim to his brand new baby brother. Tim quickly feels neglected. For example, his former bedtime ritual of both of his parents coming to his room to read him stories, sing him a special song and hug and kiss him goodnight turns into both of them running up and down the hall towards the baby's room and then passing out from exhaustion on the livingroom couch. But not only does Tim resent the new baby, he becomes suspicious of him. That baby doesn't seem to be acting like a regular baby. Tim thinks the little tyke isn't who he seems to be. Tim thinks that baby is up to something, and Tim is absolutely right! He catches his baby brother talking – talking in complete sentences – on a (toy) telephone! Tim confronts the baby and the baby answers him! This Boss Baby (voiced by Alec Baldwin) tells Tim that he's on an undercover mission for Baby Corp., the company which produces and distributes babies all over the world. Baby (whose actual name we don't hear until late in the movie) demands Tim's help, promising that once his job there is done, he'll leave Tim's house for good. Tim's parents work for Puppy Co, which is developing a new kind of puppy that will cut into the amount of family love available to babies more than any previous puppy model before it. With Tim's help (and the help of other babies – voiced by Conrad Vernon, Eric Bell Jr., ViviAnn Yee and David Soren – whose parents also work at the company), Baby plans to infiltrate Puppy Co, find out what they're working on, and stop the company and their CEO (Steve Buscemi) from turning any more baby love into puppy love.""The Boss Baby"" is pretty creative and a lot of fun! Screenwriter Michael McCullers (the scribe of the last two ""Austin Powers"" movies, ""Baby Mama"", ""Hotel Transylvania 3"" and ""Shrek 5"") successfully expands the premise of Frazee's novel to make it worthy of a feature film. Director Tom McGrath (helmer of the ""Madagascar"" movies and ""Megamind"") makes sure the screen is filled with colorful, imaginative and enjoyable scenes to propel this childhood adventure to its very satisfying conclusion. The talented voice cast delivers solid performances and the computer animation lives up to the high standards that Movie Fans expect from DreamWorks films. The story is a throwback to earlier styles of animated kid adventures, reminding me of ""Toy Story"" and similar older movies). The result is a film that's mostly kid-friendly (with just a little coarse language and a bunch of toilet jokes and shots of baby butts) and may even make parents feel a little nostalgic for movies from their childhoods. ""The Boss Baby"" is pretty boss – and is great fun for the whole family. ""A-""",The Boss Baby

Not entirely worth your time but children may like it.,4,31 May 2017,"'THE BOSS BABY' was directed by Tom McGrath and stars Alec Baldwin, Tobey Maguire and Steve Buscemi. ​When his new baby brother comes into Tim(Tobey Maguire)'s life, wearing a sharp suit and tie, Tim feels there is something wrong with him and desperately tries to prove to his Mum(Lisa Kudrow) and Dad(Jimmy Kimmel) that there is something wrong. But as evens unfold, he sees that things are not as they seem.My expectations for this movie were lower than low. From the trailers, I thought this movie would be one of the worst movies of this year. After seeing it, I was half right. It isn't a good movie but I don't see it as particularly bad. Kids will definitely enjoy it, there is no doubt about that so if you want a harmless thing to let your kids watch, they'll be occupied for 90 minutes but aside from that, I just don't recommend it. Movies like 'Toy Story', 'The Iron Giant' and even 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King' have proved we can have stellar animated movies that appeal for both children and adults so I naturally assume that most competent animated movies will attempt to appease both. With the exception of some funny movie references, this movie provides very, very little for more mature audiences to enjoy. The moral is only for children and doesn't have much(if any) appeal to adults. If you're a parent who wants to relax for an hour, your kids will probably be entertained but if you don't fall into that category, I don't recommend it.Not to say that animated movies need a stellar story, but this movie was pathetically predictable. Great movies can be predictable but they need to at least try to stand out from the pack. I'd argue the rough concept of this movie is similar to 'Storks' from last year and that the morals presented are nothing original either. On top of that, if you claim the ending of this movie is surprising or 'touching', you really need to watch more movies. I predicted that before the movie was even on.Alec Baldwin was, to be fair to him, pretty great as 'The BOSS Baby' and made this movie watchable. Both Tobey Maguire and Steve Buscemi did fine in the supporting cast but that is this movie's primary flaw. Everything is just fine. Very little stands out and is great but by the same comparison, very little is outwardly bad or frustrating. It's just kind of average. None of the characters are particularly memorable and just exist to hurry the plot along.As far as animation goes, this movie is pretty nice to look at. It's nothing special or anything, and I could have done without the annoying eyes, but it's perfectly passable and won't take you out of the movie too much. It tries to be more cartoony that realistic and takes plenty of liberties as such so it's perfectly enjoyable for children to look at but isn't anything too impressive because who actually puts effort into animated movies? They're just for kids, right?I will say I laughed around about 5 times in this movie and all of those times were purely because of movie references. So if it's not THAT funny and doesn't have a great story/cast of characters, what does it have going for it? I'll say it has a good heart. While the story is pretty predictable and I cannot see many adults enjoying this, it's a perfectly disposable film that will entertain kids and perhaps even offer them a moral lesson. Aside from that, I can't say I recommend it. I'll rate it a 4 out of 10 bottles of milk.",The Boss Baby
67,x_manicure_x,"A pleasant movie, nothing more nothing less",5,14 August 2021,"I expected this to be much worse to be honest. If felt more like a Pixar movie than a Dreamworks one (in a good way).The jokes are kind of mild, but I guess it is marketed for both parents and children to watch so that's acceptable. You won't laugh but at least smile a few times through it. If I had kids I would love watching it with them for movie night. Just wished for the plot to be less predictable (the ideas are pretty good but are developed in the worst ways especially towards the end)...",The Boss Baby
68,kermitkid,One joke premise gets old quickly,7,30 March 2020,"Sadly, this wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. It was still pretty good, just not the laugh riot I was expecting. It's still clever, but it's...a Dreamworks movie. You get what you expect when you hear Dreamworks. It was by no means a bad film. I actually quite enjoyed it, it just could have had a bit more effort thrown in to it. The plot is pretty clever (although some of it doesn't really make sense, but hey, it's a kids movie. It's supposed to be silly), the voice acting is pretty good (Especially from Alec Baldwin and Jimmy Kimmel), but overall I don't think most people will remember it in 5 years. It will probably be the same case that it was with ""Over the Hedge"" or ""Shark Tale"" where when you mention it people will say ""Oh yeah...that came out..."" Still a pretty good, cute, harmless kids movie (kids will definetely enjoy it) but overall, not very memorable. The film has some really cute moments, and there were some jokes that I laughed at, but it wasn't as good as the trailers made it seem.

The story deals with seven year old Tim who enjoys a happy life with his parents Janice and Ted. Tim's life changes when gets a baby brother who turns out can actually talk and works for a company named baby Corp which has babies with adult minds.

70,shobanchittuprolu,"The Boss Baby is a passable animated film but if you really want to watch it,I recommend watching it only in 3D.",6,5 November 2017,"The Boss Baby (2017): In the early days of computer-generated animation, the stories weren't very taxing but the writing was expressive and the animation was breathtaking. However, as the days of Pixar and Dreamworks evolved, the stories started to become more advanced, and it seemed like the technology grew on pace with the storytelling tools that the filmmakers would use. However, with any growth medium, there's bound to be a ceiling, and The Boss Baby is further proof that maybe we should scale back on the CGI films, because while the visuals are still gorgeous, the stories are really starting to drop.Plot: A new baby's arrival impacts a family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator -- a wildly imaginative 7-year-old named Tim. The most unusual Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) arrives at Tim's home in a taxi, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. The instant sibling rivalry must soon be put aside when Tim discovers that Boss Baby is actually a spy on a secret mission, and only he can help thwart a dastardly plot that involves an epic battle between puppies and babies.My Review: The Boss Baby is one of the most contrived and complicated children's cartoons you'll see all year.Half-way into the film,you can clearly observes several adult references and crass humor which is cheap way to attract both adults and kids but they guessed it wrong.Grown-ups never need adult jokes to make them laugh and the makers should have rechecked their supposed master plan as we do not expect such grossy comedy from the producers who bought us Kung Fu Panda,Madagascar and lot more.Even the plot of stop a dastardly plan to invent a puppy so adorable that people stop having babies clearly not at all a kid-stuff.Even with such confusing aspects still The Boss Baby is good one to watch with few moments to laugh and definitely will not get bored.But with some focus on clever writing,this movie could have been lot better.The film trades in both vaguely sly ""adult jokes"" and overly broad children's humor, with neither really landing a killing blow of entertainment. What makes this even worse is the fact that the film's story is a disjointed mess that could really use some effective humor to fill in the narrative cracks..But perhaps the best component of The Boss Baby are the retro-futuristic visuals the film is drenched in. The folks who designed the film's look must have really loved The Incredibles, because that film's 60's jet-set style visuals are well represented in every frame of this film.The best part is watching it in 3D.The Boss Baby is one of the best 3D experiences you should watch.The depth and the pop-out effects are brilliantly done that we even forget how lacking the plot is.So,The Boss Baby is a passable animated film but if you really want to watch it,I recommend watching it only in 3D.My Rating 6/10",The Boss Baby
71,zac-04879,Another Watchable Animated Comedy for Families,6,10 July 2021,"This imaginative animation is a fun choice for family movie night. The silly humour will give the kids a fun giggle and the whole story is enough to enjoy, despite the rude humour and slapstick imagination which is just a common element in most kids' animation movies. The film seems to entertain reasonably and push a message towards the audience.It's not a specific message, but it's the film's main theme: family (mainly siblings). It's not a dorky comedy that'll touch a child's heart in a powerful approach, but is just meant as a fun tale. The Boss Baby is about the fact that there's an equal amount of love in a family.So yeah. It's a nice family message, but other than that, this flick obviously has its ups and downs. The imaginative elements are pretty fun and creative. There's some silly but original and amusing ideas in there, including the fantastical idea of where babies come from and their goals in life. However, the film's climax is really standard, plus not every scene is going to entertain everyone. The Boss Baby is a movie that a lot of audiences would recommend for kids and families, but it's a pretty typical tale that's just fine.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Boss Baby
72,asifahsankhan,"So, there's this baby. He's not like any baby, though. He's cute but not really. He talks but not really. He acts. . . and acts like a boss. That's wacky!",6,29 April 2017,"This film stitches together a crazily convoluted plot of kids' movie clichés like it's making a be-suited Frankenstein's monster.Baldwin plays a slick, smarmy business baby that arrives unexpectedly at the Templeton family's home in a taxi and proceeds to channel the actor's Glengarry Glen Ross corporate trainer and 30 Rock executive in a near-constant stream of film and managerial references. Of course Janice and Ted Templeton (Lisa Kudrow and Jimmy Kimmel) were expecting a new baby, but not like this. The other person not expecting this (at least not THAT way) is the Templeton's seven-year-old son, Tim (Miles Christopher Bakshi). Tim doesn't want a baby brother. He's happy being the sole object of his parents' affection. Rather than establishing the relationship between parent and child, this is discussed at length in confusing and unnecessary voice-over by Tobey Maguire as Future Tim. In between a plethora of anus jokes (The Boss Baby has more on- screen butts than your average episode of Game of Thrones), the movie pitches you the ideas that babies are made in a factory in heaven, some for families and some for corporate use, and that there is an unending and vicious war between babies and puppies for the finite amount of love in the world.For the most part, it's merely mediocre, trotting out all the overly familiar ""Believe in yourself"" and ""importance of family"" messages that every other CGI family flick must preach. However, there's something downright tragic about all the money, time and talent it took to make this instantly forgettable movie that's summed up entirely by a title. Everyone involved could have done something better, especially the animators, who toiled for hundreds of hours on something that will be met with a mild shrug.The overall message is undeniable: Even if a BABY says he wants to be a BOSS, he really wants to be a BABY. Because he is a BABY.",The Boss Baby
73,FelipeCarrillo,Let's Hope The Modest Success Does Not End In A Franchise Torment,7,20 July 2017,"Blessed be the only children who didn't have to stand the discomfort with the intrusion of a new sibling. Arguably, whatever the reason, jealousy ( the over sensitive response that arises when you see a threat over something of great personal value) emerges innately in humans: in a love relationship, at work, at school, in the family. On this familiar premise, ""The Baby Boss"" hits on the correct artery in order to delight both parents and children with a boyish thinking message that will convince by way of gags even the most skeptical and cerebral movie buff.The feature film is ""freely"" inspired by the children's book published in 2010 by Marla Frazee, ""freely"" because development isn't pulled out from the pages verbatim, without talking about the unequal design of pictures. DreamWorks still keeps up, by reminding its contenders that they returned to take back the prerogative gained with animated audiovisual productions such as ""Madagascar,"" ""Shrek,"" ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and latest ""Trolls."" It sets Tom McGrath as a filmmaker, the ideal director due to he's directed several movies of the company's orders, has also addressed with different content about childhood in his films in an underlying way. The script embraces high doses of gags and sketches that will look after mostly adults, this inclination is inductive when we find out that his writer, Michael McCullers, was the man who conceived the scripts of ""Austin Powers"" or ""Baby Mama"" and some episodes of American NBC'S ""Saturday Night Live"". Here slapstick and deadpan are mixed with the beautiful thoughts of a 7-year-old child to provide a compendium of occurrences touching deeply in the general public with great assertiveness. Sweeping aside the festive subject, the nuclear story line evokes productions that applied the same central narrative skeleton (""Look Who's Talking"", ""Littleman"" or ""Family Guy"" series), a steadfast structure due to the warm welcome by the audience, the nonsense of the jocular pantomime of a baby working as an older man is the strongest fun producer. However, focusing on the plot and its progress, the mind of an infant is the device used to spark a succession of full positions of inventiveness, in addition, it manages to keep pace and dynamic firmly during the three acts, although the second section was prolonged more than it should be had. As a movie chiefly intended for children, lessons must be of great importance. At first, I had to deal with strong headaches about how they could present an appropriate closing to the story, as due to the passing of the situations seemed that it'd be getting an ending out of the ordinary, nonetheless, happy endings will always be. Beyond accepting the newcomer, the film reflects on teamwork, discrepancy-solving and a poorly worked labor aspect, however, children must receive a small explanation by their parents because of the ""complexity"" of lessons comprehension.Despite the fact that it weights the previous considerations, disrupts the impact of topics which aren't explicit on screen and suddenly the arduous search not to adopt the label of the commercial title is eradicated in full. The two cute main leads are engagingly designed, 7-year-old Tim assumes the figure of father and he has the responsibility to select the most circumspect decisions; the counterpoint is the baby, who with the tyrannical voice of Alec Baldwin achieves the execution of adorable effects. Undoubtedly, the title character is the spotlight, however, the real hero is Tim. Although the villain character is prorated between tender canine pets, campaign creator and his henchman, they diverge as soon as the baby appears on the screen.While it falls apart in the formation of some approaches, embraces as a key piece its animation, which keeping in mind guidelines established by Pixar in terms of scrupulosity and concern for detail, loiters between the sweet and the effective, and this doesn't result in a handful of anodyne images exactly, based on two- dimensional lines, on the contrary, these ones' brilliance give rise to concentrate on textures and colors of the fabulous imagination, which from the first minutes run an interesting introduction. Tim's imaginary visions affect the presentation of them, which gamble with a range of designs and arts, beautifully devised by astonishing 3D (the effect with a drop of drool is maddening). The soundtrack isn't high, but it fits in each frame with certain effectiveness, from Beatles' altered melodies to OST, fit together in dramatic scenes or frantic car chases.With a straight-to-the-point start and an emotional mature conclusion, Tom McGrath's ""The Baby Boss"" serves to introduce DreamWorks back into the audiovisual animated panorama, at the same time it expresses, from the perspective of a 7-year-old child, the affective parity that parents must have with the arrival of a new baby and the acceptance and understanding from the only child who should assimilate the arrival of a sibling. In addition, as a mass consumption movie, parents and children enjoy the two fabulous first parts of the feature film, however, it will be fatiguing to digest the last segment going back to a happy ending and the corresponding death of the villain. Perhaps, one day, a movie will break narrative projections of animation, meanwhile, let's enjoy the visual candies of this baby and his corporate mission. The diaper of animation is slowly getting dirty.",The Boss Baby
74,Jared_Andrews,Give into the Cuteness,5,11 August 2017,"First of all, recognize that this is a children's movie. So, a completely coherent plot isn't even the icing on the cake. It's more like one extra and very beautiful icing flower on top of the icing on the cake. What I'm saying is not all kids' movies totally make sense, so don't get too mad at Boss Baby for not totally making sense.The standard movie of this ilk is littered with inconsistencies and overlooked logical flaws. In that sense, Boss Baby is a standard movie.In a much different sense, Boss Baby is far, far from standard. It's brimming with creativity and bold stylistic choices. Not everything works, but enough does to justify the attempts.The creative dynamic comes from the nature of the storytelling. The movie unfolds through the wildly inventive eyes of 7-year-old Tim. His boundless imagination makes him a questionable narrator, like Amy Dunne in Gone Girl, except he's not a psychotic murderer.At any moment, Tim can suddenly morph into a ninja (to give one example) and his perceived world morphs accordingly to fit his current fantasy. This creates a number of whimsical and forceful action sequences that will mesmerize children and should keep adults at least mildly amused.Digging a bit deeper, the movie is really about the love between brothers. Well, that and the obvious yet still funny metaphor that babies are really in charge. The brotherly moments work surprisingly well for the most part. They even elicited in me some of the intended emotions during a few key scenes when the baby realized that Tim cared for him and vice versa.Despite being completely predictable, these moments are still touching. Maybe it's the cartoon cuteness or maybe the filmmakers tactfully achieved something here. Either way, it works.Overall, I came away more satisfied than I anticipated, partly because I accepted Boss Baby for what it was. Your kids will enjoy this movie. If you relax your critical analysis, and most importantly give into the cuteness, you may enjoy it too.",The Boss Baby

I like how the actions viewed by adult characters look tame, but in the children's perspective it is very frantic and colorful; reminded me a lot of Rugrats. The voice acting by Alec Baldwin and Steve Buscemi is adequate too, but for the most part, it is an exhausting marathon of toilet humor, manic gags, and bizarre pop culture references. It tries to be emotional at times, but the overall silliness makes it difficult for the drama to sink in.",The Boss Baby

There were a lot of really funny jokes that made me laugh as well as the kids that were at the movie, and that is what matters. It was a kids movie and the kids enjoyed it. While I didn't really like how there were a lot of vomit jokes and fart jokes, I really enjoyed the jokes like the baby face sun, the pacifier scene, the fight scene in the yard, and the whole just concept of Alec Baldwin playing a baby.

As CG films go, this is among the best. It is fun, there is a lot of underlying intelligence, a lot of creativity, and fun. But if you are the typical Rotten Tomatoes fan, you won't get this. And if the reviews on places such as iTunes count for anything, it is to show that in 80% of cases the public disagrees with RT reviews.

The idea of a baby being a Boss felt so stupid and could of been done in a less childish way and maybe develop the character a bit more. The Movie has the boy knows the baby's doing stuff but she has none of it and blames her son instead of a 'supposedly there baby' original absolutely not it's been done to dust as some people might cool it. The ending is laughable with terrible acting but actors. The only good thing about this movie is the Animation but even that's not perfect for a 2019 movieOverall 2/10.,The Boss Baby
82,nasdagoodshepherd,A Fair Review,6,19 March 2020,"Let's see...make a sequel of Captain Underpants, a sequel of Abominable, a sequel of Mr. Peabody & Sherman? NOPE! How about making a sequel of The Boss Baby! Yeah, DreamWorks, that is a good idea! (Of course not, you know that was sarcasm) Though, I'm gonna give this movie a fair review so I can share my fair opinion to everyone. Normally, I don't think The Boss Baby is that bad, I mean it's a weak movie but it isn't bad at all. I though the movie was pretty alright. First, I'm gonna be talking about Alec Baldwin voicing a baby. Alec Baldwin playing The Boss Baby himself is kinda cute and sometimes it gets kinda off, and when I mean off, I mean it doesn't feel sort of right. I mean, Seth MacFarlane voicing Stewie Griffin from Family Guy isn't adorable, it's kinda funny when it comes to Seth's character because Seth and the writers of Family Guy gave Stewie such a funny character development, as for The Boss Baby however, it doesn't quite work. Then there's Tim. Tim is one of the main protagonists of the movie and he has an overactive imagination that fits him so well because, he's a cute little boy and he is rather smart like me. The style of the movie is honestly perfect. It kinda reminds me of the style from Mr. Peabody and Sherman and Captain Underpants. I really like this cartoony environment because it really gives me a decent vibe from other cartoons that I like to watch. Also, there were some pretty funny moments and some moments that are light-hearted and heartwarming. However, the story is typcal, The Boss Baby and Tim are like the same characters who first met each other and dislike each and in the middle, they get along, and at the end, they become friends. To me, it is getting quite repetitive. They did it with Shrek, they did it with Home, it goes on and on. Even in other movies (that aren't from DreamWorks) like The Secret Life of Pets and The Good Dinosaur, it's the same typical thing, do you think stuff like this is getting old? Overall, I don't find The Boss Baby a bad movie, it's just another average animated film. But hey, Storks was a lot times better than this and I don't mind The Boss Baby getting a TV show on Netflix, but a sequel? I don't think so...sorry. I give The Boss Baby a 6.7/10",The Boss Baby

85,Animated_Antic,A very confusing and strange mess.,5,4 September 2017,"Oh DreamWorks, where did you go wrong? As most of you know, DreamWorks has been really struggling recently to come up with a very good animated movie after Disney started turning out some fantastic movies. Recently, DreamWorks has made some bad duds like ""Home"" and ""Trolls"" and sadly, ""The Boss Baby"" is yet another one. While it's nowhere near as bad as the previous movies and the appalling marketing of the film made by Fox, it's still left me feeling very confused and pretty shocked. I'll try to explain why that is because honestly, it's really hard to say why.Timmy Templeton (Miles Bakshi) is living a happy life with his parents Ted and Janice (Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow). That is until the new baby ""brruuuuu-tthhhher"" (this is an actual ""joke"" from the movie) arrives. The Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) as he is know by, starts to take up the Timmy's precious time with his parents, which makes him very jealous. After discovering the baby's secret that he can apparently talk, it is revealed that he works for a company called Baby Corp., a sort of business in the clouds run by, you guessed it, babies. It is then revealed that the Boss Baby is trying to uncover a secret plan from the companies rival Puppy Co. who is planning to reveal a new puppy to rival the cuteness of babies. Wanting to leave the house so he can get promoted at his company, the Boss Baby teams up with Timmy to uncover the secret of Puppy Co. before it's too late. That was my best description of the plot because it was so confusing to follow.The idea of the movie itself is pretty stupid. After seeing some of the horrible trailers for the film, I immediately thought DreamWorks had hit rock bottom in their film department. Then after doing some research, I discovered that this film was inspired by a picture book written by Marla Frazee which clarified a lot of problems I had with the movie. If the film had been released as a twenty minute short film with the Puppy Co. elements removed, I think it would have had a better chance. However, since the elements are present, the film just felt like it was stretched thin. As for the animation, it's awful. I mean terrible. It tried to be cartoony and over the top and I think it went way overboard which made it pretty painful to watch. Also, the film clearly was meant to be viewed in 3D, but because I saw it in a typical 2D showing, the elements that are supposed to pop out of the screen just looked awkward. As for the characters, there mostly unfunny. The kids will get bored by the business talk while adults might get shocked by some of the jokes. One joke that absolutely shocked me was a joke involving religion. What were they thinking when they put that in? Also, while I think Alec Baldwin can be funny at times, he felt really out of place as the baby. He's supposed to play the younger brother of a seven year old boy yet the older version of Timmy was played by Tobey Maguire who's nearly twenty younger than Baldwin. Isn't that ridiculous? The other actors like Lisa Kudrow and even Jimmy Kimmel who made me laugh out loud at the Oscars, didn't have anything funny to do in the film. The only notable exception is Miles Bakshi who I felt was perfectly cast as Timmy and actually did make me chuckle a bit.""The Boss Baby"" just felt like a confusing and dull waste of time. I feel really bad for the director, Tom McGrath, who has made many good movies in the past with DreamWorks, but sadly he didn't bring the humor and charm of his previous movies into this film. If you want a better movie that focuses on babies, just rent ""Storks"". However, if your kids really want to watch this movie, it's not a bad movie to put on a to distract the kids. Just don't expect a lot out of it.",The Boss Baby
86,eparazak,Alec Baldwin is a baby!,5,1 April 2017,"The Boss Baby is the latest animated film by Dreamworks. It stars Alec Baldwin as the movie's title character. It's about an intelligent baby who is sent to the Timpleton family to stop an evil company called Puppy Co from terminating the attention of babies. Along the way, he will have to deal with his big brother Timothy Timpleton.I'm gonna be honest, I had no high expectations going in. I saw this as just a stupid movie that was made passable to kids. In the end, my initial thoughts kind of made sense since the entire theater was full of kids.With that being said, this movie is definitely passable for kids.My main issue with the movie is that it overall makes very little sense. I'm probably not the only one to say or think that it's a confusing movie with a confusing story and a confusing concept. There are many plot points that don't make sense. There are concepts that don't make sense. For example, the parents don't seem to hear the babies talking while they're having their little meeting; that's not a spoiler, it's in the trailer. Is this supposed to be some Rugrats thing where the parents can't hear the babies speaking? Aside from the nonsensicalness of the movie, there is the comedy. The comedy helps reinforce the fact that I think the movie is passable for kids as most of the humor is very lowbrow. Were there any good jokes in the movie? Well, I had a few laughs here and there, so yeah, there was a little bit of good comedy.The animation style looks very subpar, to the point where I questioned if this was supposed to be put into theaters originally. It's not bad animation though, it just has a style that is way too cartoony, and with CGI animation, there is a line between cartoony and realistic animation that should stay around the middle-ish area. However, what I can give the animation style props for is how it shows us the perspective of Tim in various creative ways. I really love this style change and it's the saving grace of the animation style.As for some of the goods, the animation, while the style is subpar, it can look pretty creative. Even if it looks nonsensical, such as the tower that you will see later on in the film. I've already talked about the way the animation is used to show the perspective of a kid. Something I loved about the movie has to be the development of the characters. I don't wanna get into much because it'll eventually lead into spoiler territory, but it goes along with the message regarding brotherhood and dealing with siblings.Overall, I thought this movie was pretty mediocre. On one hand it has a mixed animation style, nonsensical story and concept. On another, it has a strong message that can be taken away by the end. I do think that kids will really enjoy it for its humor, even if it can be lowbrow. Others may also like it and some may consider it to be a guilty pleasure of theirs. I don't think it's on the levels of Shark Tale bad, just mediocre. However, it did come very close to getting a 4 from me...",The Boss Baby

89,trevor-82944,A Fresh Diaper of Ideas That Needs to Be Changed,2,31 March 2017,"Anyone with younger siblings out there? Pop quiz: When you saw your new little brother or sister arrive into the family, what was your immediate reaction? Were you afraid he or she might detract your attention from mom and dad? Did you anticipate you would somehow have to love this factory of poopy diapers? Is it even worth it to have a sibling after all?DreamWorks' newest feature The Boss Baby, based on the children's book by Marla Frazee, explores those concepts for all of twenty minutes, then fills in the remaining run time with the usual tasteless humor and adult references expected by the studio made famous by Shrek. While the supporting cast gives somewhat decent voice performances, nothing else of memorable interest defines their characters. The whole focus lands on the one big star on the poster. ​ After recent critical praise on SNL, Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, The Cooler) now makes his second portrayal of our current blonde, small- handed president in a form for the kiddos. He tells his whole story to us, where he came from, how he got here, and why. You see, a corporation exists out in the heavens called ""Baby Corp,"" a business composed of babies. No reason going into where they came from, or the intent of their mission statement, you're not supposed to think too hard about it. Why? Because make-believe, duh!Baby Corp's workers go across a machine that powders their butts, applies their diapers, and categorizes them based on how ticklish they are. If they're ticklish, they are sent to a couple's doorstep. If not, they are sent to management—an enormous office setting built out of baby supplies such as crayons on their desk. Now no more pressure in explaining to your kids where babies come from! DreamWorks' masterpiece will make them believe their lie, no problem! Then they'll stop asking you about it and you two can go back to your happy time in the bedroom!Anyway, the one resembling a miniature Trump gets sent to management, then from there to the doorstep to lead a mission against their ultimate enemy: puppies! Specifically, he has his motives set on stopping the new brand by Puppy Co., the ""Forever Puppy,"" an immortal infinitely young dog breed. Yet he needs the assistance of the family's seven-year-old son. Yes, I know. Riveting, isn't it? Well, maybe so if you were the same age as the two leading kids. Then again if the demographic targets families of kids all ages, why does it include baby powder farts, a censor block over the infant's privates, pant zipper music, and a doggie inflatable bouncy house with an exit through its anus? There are also subtle signs of mistreatment towards puppies: they are seen hanging from balloons at a convention, as if animal cruelty laws don't apply. Obviously, the makers of this fast-paced childish noise don't care about growing up, just painting adults as the villains of a boy's elaborate imagination where he has to lie to solve his problems. Judging by what we see on Fox News, I say we need some adulthood, and such movies are not helping today's kids grow up!The main child, Tim, offers a particularly damaging mindset for kids to look through, as virtually everything he sees is filtered through his rainbow-tinted glasses. Even if the fantasies' altered 2-D style of animation look fun and stylistic, the concept of his talking baby brother back in the 3-D animation style would suggestively reflect how he feels about having a new sibling, which many narrative points blaringly contradict. Plus, a one point, they're at an airport together, and not one adult notices the unaccompanied minors. I'm sorry, the concept sounds funny and all, but I can't buy into it until it decides what to be.The Boss Baby is not the type of entertainment you sit down and enjoy together, but rather the type of brash noise used to calm your child's temper tantrums for a measly hour and a half so you two can enjoy some peace and quiet by yourselves for once. You can count on time getting wasted both in the theater and at home with this heap, so you're better off using Disney or Pixar to divert your kid's attention, or even using these modes of entertainment as experiences for the parents and children to enjoy together. Anything to get you away from a miniature Alec Baldwin barfing on screen works just fine.",The Boss Baby
90,Clank_Zoka,Not as Bad as I Thought But Still Not the Best DreamWorks Film Out There,6,9 April 2017,"After I saw the trailers, I knew this would be the Rugrats/Baby Geniuses and Look Who's Talking movie from DreamWorks despite being based off a book, I went In expecting It to be average AND......I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.It's not Trolls level of Unnecessary and way too hip and modern, the film plays like a Disney cartoon from the 50s and 60s, the way the animation looks, the setting of this movie, the music and the plot, It feels like a cartoon but turned Into a movie, with that said I actually liked the movie and what It offered.The animation has that Storks look (despite the Idea being similar to that movie), It has a cute look to It, while It does have different styles when Tim goes Into his Imagination worlds where he's a pirate, explorer Etc, It makes It relate able and Interesting and even the moral (which I won't give away but I think anyone can guess what It Is) can relate to most kids who watch this movie, sure the movie makes no sense and It's very cartoon, but It does have a good moral.The characters are pretty fun and well voice acted, Alec Baldwin Is great as the title character, the kid who voices Tim Is pretty great too, but the rest of the characters are pretty funny too.But the movie does suffer from a simple but predicable plot, pretty obvious toilet, fart humor, It does have adult humor but It does comes off as obvious as well despite being funny.So yeah, the movie's...an improvement from Trolls, It's on par with Home In the pretty good category, but It's not the best from DreamWorks, hopefully Captain Underpants will Improve from this movie.I'm giving Boss Baby a 6/10.",The Boss Baby

Not crazy about the design of the characters, the very hectic editing and, fundamentally, the whole ""puppy vs baby"" premise is disturbing but, despite all this, the movie is entertaining and not torture to watch at all. The main reason is Alec Baldwin; he's just fun as this CEO baby character. It just clicks. And ; more importantly, it works if you think about his SNL President parody: One can't help but draw parallels when the baby plays golf in a middle of a meeting etc etc. So, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but the parallel with present day important people adds another level of interpretation... and fun! to this movie.",The Boss Baby
93,johnplocar,"I'm sorry ""Boss Baby""...you're actually a good movie.",7,22 April 2017,"I feel like I should apologize to ""Boss Baby""...I went into this movie under the preconceived notion that this was going to be bad. I saw a couple trailers and immediately was not sold. Judging from the marketing I didn't find it humorous with too many pandering fart jokes and ""baby cuteness"" fluff, I didn't like the style as it looked fairly generic, and the story seemed uninspired...cut to an hour and twenty minutes later, I can honestly say I was very wrong about this movie and I should know better than to judge a book by its cover...or a movie by its trailer. The comedy was pretty funny for the most part, aside from the few times it did fell short. The art direction was terrific and truly gorgeous to watch, drawing from the same vein as a lot of older ""Warner Bros."" cartoons. Lastly, the story has so much more creativity and to it than I would have ever expected from a movie titled ""Boss Baby"". To give a brief summary of the plot; the movie is about a young boy who recently receives a baby brother and from there learns to come to terms with the new addition to the family through his imagination creating over-the-top scenarios and stories that they find themselves in. From that perspective, seeing this movie approximately 90% as an insight into the imagination of a seven year old boy, the film works. If someone were to take this film's story literally happening all the way through then it will leave a bad taste and a huge amount of confusion. From the start, however, the movie does establish that the young boy (Tim) has a highly active imagination and it is believable that he would come up with such extreme anecdotes that he puts himself in. In that regard, I found this to be a very enjoyable sit. That being said, it's far from perfect. There are times where the comedy does fall a little flat with pandering fart and puke jokes or just simply having the gimmick of there being babies on screen being serious. Also, in the final act of the movie it was becoming exceedingly difficult to figure out where reality ended and imagination began within the plot. There was so much playing around with the ludicrous nature of the premise that the story began to lose focus as to how much is actually happening in the real world and what is made up in Tim's mind. So the third act doesn't quite hold up if you think about it too much, which my advice is to not think about it too much. Leave your brain at the entrance and just kind of let the movie happen, if you do that you should have a decent time with this. Especially if you have children, since this movie is so fast paced it should keep the attention of the entire family and make it a quick sit.If you give this movie a real chance and not try to think too much about the logistics of everything happening on screen then you will find a relatively sweet little movie about a boy imagining some wacky adventures that he has with his baby brother in order to come to grips with not being the center of attention of his parents anymore, but rather a full family. There will be some laughs, some cuteness sprinkled in, pretty imagery, good animation, entertaining action, and a little bit of heart as well. This is nowhere near as bad as the trailers made this movie out to be, so if you have little ones then this is actually a good one to show them. It's not insulting or the cash-grab movie it could have been, there was a lot more thought put into this movie and I think it may actually teach kids something about gaining a little brother or sister.",The Boss Baby
94,CrazyCockatoo2003,A boring snoozefest that further proves DreamWorks has lost it's touch lately.,4,3 July 2021,"Despite the large amount of hate this movie gets, I, for one, agree with the haters to a certain extent. Back then, I thought it was okay. Now, I just don't care for this anymore, and I'd rather not watch it.What I disliked about this movie is that the characters are badly written, the ideas this movie has could be executed better than what we ended up with, the jokes don't land, it overuses so many of the clichés and tropes found in modern animated movies and manages them really poorly, boring pacing, the imagination sequences can be a bit too distracting from the reality of this movie, it lacks charm, the story makes little sense, and a lazy attempt at sequel baiting that somehow worked out for DreamWorks.The best thing that this boring and mediocre trainwreck of a film could do is that it retains the spirit of the book despite not being that accurate (or anything to write home about) in the first place. This is most evident around 5-10 minutes into the movie.However, it does have some other good qualities, such as the animation and voice acting, the imagination sequences are memorable sometimes, okay introduction of the characters and setting, Tim and Boss Baby are some of the better written characters and have decent chemistry, and there is room for character development.Overall, I thought this movie was really boring, and incredibly mediocre. Possibly one of the most mediocre films I've seen in a while. In fact, I got so bored I skipped ahead several scenes before turning it off. However, I remember enough of what happens in the movie from previous viewings of this movie that I can complete this review.

What impressed me most were the fantasy and action set pieces that move the plot forward, which were far more imaginative, colorful, and clever (and plentiful) than I expected. The trailers I had seen prior to the film's opening had me thinking it would be a one-joke film, but it turned out the film's creators had a lot more imaginative plot ideas up their sleeve and I'm grateful they didn't give most of them away in the pre-opening advertising--it was a delight to discover just how over-the-top the film goes in its visuals and creativity as the film unfolded (even from the very first scenes of babies arriving from where they're ""made."") Alec Baldwin was the perfect choice for the lead character's voice: his work on ""30 Rock,"" and even on the current ""Match Game"" game show as host (not to mention his kidding, 'wink-wink', you're in-on-the-joke amusing appearances on talk shows over the years) revealed long ago that he has the perfect voice for comedy voice-over work.

103,iamianiman,"A Sunday afternoon movie with the whole family, seriously...I ain't joking",5,28 March 2017,"The Boss Baby. Hmm, where can I begin with to say about this movie? One thing that's for sure; after I left the theater I don't think the movie is worth remembering as those other boisterous animation movies such as the colorful Inside Out or the legendary Toy Story trilogy.It has been somewhat a major issue that this movie is discriminated by a few people who think that it could lower down one's IQ due to the ridiculous concept; a talking baby who acts like he's the boss. Well, judging by the trailer, I could partially agree with the things mocked by them. Despite that, let's talk about the whole movie. Yes, this movie has a bizarre plot; producing babies in a factory machine. But there are legitimately pretty good things in The Boss Baby. First and foremost; this movie is so hilarious. Watching it with your kids or friends can make you giggle and be heard by the audience in front of you. That standard giggling is mutual as when someone is tickling you at your right spot. Even tough audiences will at least smile and think about the sweetness this movie has.I'll admit that I could barely relate with the baby on the first act of the movie. It doesn't really give him adequate space to introduce himself but it gets along pretty well the second and third acts. It will gradually pick up its pace towards the main plot and the questions of who? why? what? etc etc. are answered when near the climax scene.The Baby reminisced me and also maybe some of you on the principal of the school located up in the air in the movie Sky High. Yeah, the one with the gigantic bald head.Let's wander around the dark area; the arts of animation aren't that impressive. You'll be wondering if they actually wanted to do the old-school style of animations or the director claimed to make a difference compared to the ones we see nowadays. The characters look as if there were very simple and soft-skinned but no enticing factor unlike Frozen or Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs. Talk about the backgrounds; the vividness of the complexity that tried to copy Fantastic Mr. Fox or the live-drama movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel failed drastically. The backgrounds can't connect with the simplistic main stage where characters are arguing or fighting against one another.The plot seems bizarre as I have said earlier but that doesn't end there, the plot too has a very confusing story for the youngsters to understand and reveal the suspense or how the movie works altogether.

I went and saw this yesterday and honestly, it's one of the best movies I have EVER seen. The plot is funny and progresses intently while the characters develop and come together in common interest. This movie is hilarious and heartwarming. I 10/10 recommend this. A man named Timothy Templeton (Tobey Maguire) tells a story through his imaginative point of view as his 7-year-old self (Miles Bakshi) who lives his days having fun with his parents, Ted (Jimmy Kimmel) and Janice (Lisa Kudrow). While tucking Tim in bed one night his parents ask if he wanted a baby brother; Tim declines the offer, saying that he is enough. After he goes to sleep, we see that Janice is pregnant.While sleeping Tim begins to wonder where babies come from. One day, Tim is surprised when a business suit-wearing infant shows up in a taxi at his house, and Ted and Janice proudly call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the baby is receiving, not to mention suspicious when the infant acts odd around him, but his parents, being blind to the baby's eccentric behavior, try to convince him that they will grow to love each other.Soon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult (Alec Baldwin) and he introduces himself as ""The Boss Baby"". Tim decides to record a conversation between him and other toddlers who are over at Tim's house for a meeting to do something about how puppies are receiving more love than babies. The Boss Baby and the other infants catch Tim with the recording and after a chase scene throughout the backyard and the house, the tape is terminated after The Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim is subsequently grounded by his parents for his actions during the chase between him and the Boss baby.The Boss Baby comes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp, a place where infants with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. They are virtual, so they cannot be seen or heard. The Boss Baby explains to Tim that he was sent on a mission to see why puppies are getting more love than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which is unleashing a new puppy on the day that employees take their children to work. The Boss Baby also explains that he stays intelligent by drinking a ""Secret Baby Formula"" which enables a baby to act like an adult. However, if a baby does not drink it after a period of time, he or she reverts to a regular baby. He hopes to receive a promotion after dealing with Puppy Co.'s new puppy, but when they overhear Boss Baby's boss threaten to fire him for not bringing in information, thereby stranding him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to keep that from happening.After appearing to have patched things up, Tim's parents lift the grounding and take them to Puppy Co. for ""take your child to work day"". While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a ""Forever Puppy"", but it turns out to be a trap set by founder Francis E. Francis . They discover that Francis used to be the head of Baby Corp. and Boss Baby's idol, but was forced out when it was discovered that his lactose intolerance kept the secret formula from working properly. Vowing revenge, Francis founded Puppy Corp. and intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing Boss Baby's serum bottle and infecting the puppies with it. Tim's parents go with Francis to Las Vegas, and Francis has his brother Eugene pose as Tim and Boss Baby's babysitter to keep them from interfering.Without a steady flow of serum to keep his intelligence in check, Boss Baby begins reverting back to being a normal baby. Despite this, he and Tim manage to evade the ""babysitter"" long enough to get to the airport, but are too late to intercept Tim's parents. Upset, Tim blames Boss Baby for using his family for his own ulterior motives, for which Boss Baby, after some hesitance, apologizes. After that, they went to airplane and come to Las Vegas.Furious at their interference, Francis proceeds to lock Tim's parents up so he can burn them with exhaust from a rocket used to launch the Forever Puppies. Tim and Boss Baby fight with him, and then push him into the formula. Boss Baby opens the rocket to let the dogs out, so they can save Tim's parents. After he successfully does that, he returns to baby state while still on the rocket, but Tim sings to him with a family song to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off of the rocket before it launches. Francis, having reverted back to baby form, attempts to attack them again, but Eugene interferes, stating he'll ""raise him right this time"" now that he's a baby again.Boss Baby gets promoted, leaves in a taxi, and Tim goes back to being an only child. But Tim and Boss Baby, having grown closer, start to miss each other. Boss Baby, fed up, decides to be part of the Templeton family permanently. He returns to the Templeton family as a regular baby named Theodore Lindsey, as the whole story turned out to be in Tim's imagination, and Ted and Janice have just brought him home from the hospital. Tim is now an adult and now the father of an older daughter and an infant daughter who acts exactly like Theodore did when he was Boss Baby.",The Boss Baby
107,svikasha,A Kid's Movie that Makes fun of Adults,6,22 May 2017,"Tim Templeton is a typical 7 year old kid. He has two loving parents who give him all the attention that a child at this age deserves. However, that dynamic changes when another baby arrives on the scene. This baby is unlike most other babies. This ""boss baby"", voiced by Alec Baldwin of 30 Rock royalty, is truly the man. He shows up everywhere in a posh suit and seems to have everything figured out from people management to the stock market. The baby was born with a knack for business that would put your average adult business executives to shame.Any parent or sibling that has experienced the rivalry that often develops when the original family dynamic is disrupted by a newborn can relate to this touching and heartfelt film. Tim's baby brother is at first grossly condescending and businesslike. He steals away Tim's parents and their attention which fuels a hilarious rivalry between the two. Although the film is clearly a kid's film, there are plenty of small jokes that only adults would understand. Quips like, ""Ugh, the people of long island do not know how to make an iced tea!"" are sure to please the adults in the audience. Ultimately, after many failed attempts at getting rid of his brother, Tim hatches a scheme that takes advantage of his baby brother's competitive spirit. Tim strikes a deal with the baby where he assists him in getting the promotion he wants in Baby Corp, in exchange for sole custody of their parent's attention. The baby agrees.Fortunately, this common purpose and the wild journey that follows ends up uniting the two siblings and a strong bond develops culminating in everybody finally accepting their place in the family. It is very natural for a sibling to feel the need to compete with a newborn. Tim's baby brother dilemma is universal and can be familiar to both parents and children everywhere trying to find their place in the world.",The Boss Baby

115,The_Film_Auditor,Has its moments,6,17 July 2018,"The Boss Baby was definitely an interesting ride. There were things I disliked in this film as well as enjoyed. Let us start with the bad. The plot for The Boss Baby is well... odd and not that strong. There are a few problems I have with it. First, it is difficult to figure out when the boss baby's older brother is just imagining crazy stuff happening or not. There are scenes that elude to the idea that the whole thing is Tim's (the big brother) imagination, and others that make it seem like he does have a boss for a baby brother. Another issue I have is with the plot; it is very convoluted. There is a conflict between puppies and babies as well as an odd ending; it makes it for a weird movie experience. Of course, this is an animated movie targeted towards children, so you can only expect so much from the plot and I understand that.As for the good, this film had some genuinely funny and emotional moments. I laughed at some of the jokes while watching the film. Some of the jokes were very childish, but again, what do you expect out of a movie like this? This movie also has some touching moments and leaves a good message to its viewers. I also really enjoyed Alec Baldwin; he does a wonderful job and is easily the highlight. Overall, I think this film has its moments, some good and some not so good.",The Boss Baby

This isn't necessarily always a bad thing as they have had some solid hits in the recent years. Kung Fu Panda remains my favorite of the series from the studio. With The Boss Baby, their signature humor remains intact. I laughed quite often in the early stages of the film. Alec Baldwin is hilarious voicing the baby at the center, however, while I admire DreamWorks for getting ambitious with the concept of the film, it is almost so high-concept, that the core audience will be completely lost and the adults will shrug at how convoluted the many twists in the plot are. Still, The Boss Baby is frequently bouncy and frenetic and will entertain the kiddies, even if they don't get all the plot points. In the end, however, the need of the directors to pile on a thickly saccharine ending that keeps rolling on, makes the film end rather disingenuously.",The Boss Baby

Unfortunately, I was sort of blinded to the movie as I revoltingly relived that chapter in my life. But at least they made this type of ""Boss"" the ""bad guy,"" for which I am thankful.The only positive message I could glean from this movie is, ""It is better to be a helpless baby who loves and is loved, than to be a know-it-all who neither loves or is loved.""

122,good-decision,It could've been genius but...,6,18 May 2017,"For an adult, this movie is still entertaining. I thought it was brilliant till one scene if the movie ruined it for me and I was like ""nooooo you stupid bastards!"". Basically the movie is about a kid with a very vivid imagination who lives reality through his imagination l. The script compares segments of reality to segments told to us through his imagination. This includes when the story about the new baby arrival to his life and how the kid thinks the new baby is actually a boss from a corporation somewhere that runs people's lives. I thought this basic idea was genius and was totally enjoying the juxtaposition till the movie decides the kid was dreaming to get out of a dilemma that didn't exist. How else would they bring the baby back into the kid's life unless he was dreaming? Right? Obviously their imagination wasn't as vivid as their character. Couldn't the memory erasing squad come back a day later and reinstall the baby? The part of the story with the nanny, evil boss, chase, rocket, etc., was also one part of ""hollywoodism"" that was completely unnecessary and didn't necessarily add to the movie. It went from a lovely heartwarming story about a kid trying to find in his heart some love for his baby brother and find his new place in a growing family to a ""car chase"" with an evil villain in a bid to save ... yup.. the world. That took the buzz out of the movie and was against all their intents and purposes really boring! There are a few laughs along the way and the script on the whole was good.",The Boss Baby

The topic really is a contradiction. Babies are cute and families are cute, but you can't just simply combine these cute factors and make a full length movie. The studio aims to capitalize on babies and families but a the same time also must confront not just fantasies. Not so family friendly questions like ""where does babies come from?"" etc will immediately come up. You really don't want to explain to nine year olds about a certain part of human anatomy, right? Thus it creates a sense of disjointedness with reality that prevents you from fully immersed in this movie.

I went with peoples positive reviews on the app and took my kid niece to watch it, I realized half way through this rubbish, I should not have listened to their app, they are so biased towards positive reviews, I since deleted their app and trust in rotten tomatoes, but to put it simply, this movie doesn't deliver what it promises in the trailers. Just because DREAMWORKS name was attach to this garbage, doesn't necessarily mean it's gold. In this case, they hit bronze, I would go low as to say copper or even zinc! The story is unbelievable, the plot is everywhere, everything felt rushed and convoluted without much thought put into the story or characters.

127,alex-klein2424,The Best Boss,7,13 June 2017,"There are a lot of animated movies that are being made in this day and age that essentially cash out on certain things that children love, like farts and cool slang and toys. What I really liked about this movie was while there were some silly portions, the overall movie was very intelligent and funny and also expertly crafted in terms of animation.Boss Baby is the story of a young boy who is getting a new baby brother and is scared that his parents won't love him the same as they used to. This boy has a wild imagination that really lends to some cool scenes where his imagination takes over and the animation changes to fit his mind. Those scenes were by far my favorites in the movie. What ends up happening, though, is instead of a baby brother, he gets Boss Baby. A suit wearing, business lingo talking baby with a hidden agenda who was put at this home to combat the growing rise of puppy love over baby love. See, Boss Baby comes from Baby Corp, a place where certain babies are not meant to be with families, but are meant for management, as the film so hilariously explains it. The crux of the movie is that the other brother wants the Boss Baby gone and the Boss Baby needs to investigate a new puppy that is being announced so they tag team to fulfill each others needs.The script is very sharp and again the animation really sticks out and stays with you after you leave the theater. Much of the movie has you remembering the times you may have had a younger sibling coming into the picture and were worried the same way. The laughs come thick and fast and most of them are from the titular character as Alec Baldwin plays him just as he does with most of his adult roles. The story, while interesting and without spoiling, was an idea I had long before this movie as a business idea (whatever who cares I'll be famous one day doesn't matter), and the typical animated movie formula is in play here so there are not too many major surprises as you watch but I still recommend you watch. It is the perfect family movie or a cute date movie. It is also a great movie for business majors and puppy lovers as well.",The Boss Baby

The only movies I like from them are Shrek 1 and 2 and Dragons 1 and 2. All of the others? Shameless cash grabs with something in it that resembles a plot with the odd laugh her and there. Not to say the other Dreamworks movies don't fail their purpose, hell some of them ARE entertaining, but they are just in general really bad movies. The Boss Baby is one of those movies. Except with this one, I felt more uncomfortable watching it then all of the other Dreamworks movies. It was pretty much worse version of Home from 2015, which REALLY shows that Dreamworks is out of ideas. Not only is Boss Baby a rehash of their film from 2 years ago, it's somehow worse than the original movie. The plot for both of them was really generic, the humour wasn't really appealing. Both movies are absolute train wrecks. This movie only made me laugh once, exactly like Home. The whole movie is just Home but remade. And it's terrible. I would not recommend this movie. It could've been something good if it wasn't a rehash of Home. But it is, and it's worse. 3/10.",The Boss Baby
132,celestekent,Freud could have written this,2,26 November 2017,"This movie is so full of phobia material and fear mongering for very young kids that it should be rated M. Granted the two main factions of plot action BABYCO and PUPPY CO were hardly very creative, but the action was filled with the most horribly subconsciously active fear generation for the younger kids.The single worst case was an undisputed claim that the first born loses the parent's love when a new born comes into a house. From the view point of a 7 year old this could be devastatingly real but it is rarely true. This movie does not even bother to offer a counter argument! Secondly, fear of babysitters. Not only does this movie encourage that fear by creating a scenario where it comes true but enhances it through the scene by having their phony baby sitter be a cruel MAN dressed as a woman.Yes in fact I do realize this is a fantasy, but its more like it comes from the horror genre of Hansel and Gretel.As a fantasy for adults this is maybe OK but please keep the kids away if they're below 10.",The Boss Baby
133,obiegimmie,'The Boss Baby:' A Disorganized and Scattered Film Unsure of Its Purpose,2,27 April 2017,"""The Boss Baby"" is a 2017 20th Century Fox animated comedy based off of a book of the same name by Marla Frazee. It is directed by Tom McGrath (""Madagascar""), with a screenplay by Michael McCullers (""Baby Mama""). The music is by Hans Zimmer (""Lion King"") and Steve Mazzaro; the editing by James Ryan; and production by Ramsey Ann Naito. It stars Alec Baldwin (""30 Rock""), Steve Buscemi (""Armageddon""), Miles Bakshi, Jimmy Kimmel (""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""), Lisa Kudrow (""Friends""), and Tobey Maguire (""Spiderman""). It was announced June 12, 2014 and, after multiple incidents in which its release was delayed, was finally cinematically released March 31, 2017 (USA). ""The Boss Baby""'s budget totaled at $125 million, and internationally, it profited $366 million. It runs for 1 hour, 37 minutes (97 minutes total) and is rated PG. Now to the review:Young Tim Templeton (Miles Christopher Bakshi; adult narrator voiced by Toby Maguire) is introduced to us as a frequent dreamer; in fact, the animation style changes when the film is switching to one of his imaginings. Tim is doted one by his parents (Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow). However, things take a turn when his obviously pregnant mother announces that Tim is about to have a baby brother. We now see a baby (Alec Baldwin) exiting a sleek limo and doing some strange dance. Why, if the mother was pregnant, is the baby clearly being transported by some otherworldly means? Are the parents in the limo? And if so, why don't we see them entering the house as well? Tim quickly learns that the baby has business-like tendencies, and that he was assigned to become a ""Boss Baby"" rather than grow up like everyone else. His objective is scattered; Tim's parents, who work for a puppy manufacturer, have access to a disclosed, yet potentially earth-shattering ForeverPuppy. Boss Baby must break into the Puppy Headquarters, steal the ForeverPuppy plans, and then return them to Baby Co. If he doesn't, he will get fired, thus turned into a regular baby that will remain in Tim's life for good. Tim, who obviously wants to be rid of Boss Baby, reluctantly agrees to help on his mission IF he agrees to never enter Tim's life or family again.+ Some of the concepts are interesting; (being replaced by a younger sibling), and are lightly touched on.+ The animation, while not Disney-level, is colorful and entertaining.+ It will likely please young kids.+ There are a few funny moments.The plot does not make sense.It becomes confusing for the watcher to separate Tim's fantasies from reality.The villain is weak; and his backstory does not make sense.2/1020%F-",The Boss Baby

So as you can imagine, expectations were pretty high. I knew from the start there were going to be lots of jokes with a tender story about sibling rivalry that turns to love of family. What I got was lots of imagination, some good chuckles, and a decent story. Much of the humor for the kids is potty humor and slapstick at its best. But they also chocked it full of nods to great movies and jokes that only the parents would catch or understand (which worked great). Alec Baldwin (the voice of Boss Baby) is the obvious the star of the show and he takes no prisoners. I can't even tell you who the other voices were in the movie because they didn't matter. This was his time to shine and he took it. The story moves very quickly and my wife actually felt that it was too convoluted for kids. I thought the ending got overly dramatic for no good reason.

136,jasonsharden,A Pleasant Surprise,8,24 April 2017,"DreamWorks' latest animated feature ""The Boss Baby"" could have easily been just another animated movie to pass the time, but surprisingly it had much more to it than you'd think. The film playfully puts you into the perspective of the main character Tim, as he deals with his newborn sibling literally invading his life. There's a fantastic overall lesson that teaches younger audiences (especially those who are the eldest) of the importance of loving their younger sibling, which I haven't seen many films of this genre do. Speaking of perspective, there are these brilliantly animated ""imagination"" sequences that not only entertain, but help older viewers be put into a place of childhood so you can better relate to Tim's character. Details and concepts like that are never wasted in this film, which brought originality to an otherwise cliché storyline. Though it suffers from the usual DreamWorks problems in regards to certain jokes and scenes, it ended up not being an overall waste of time.",The Boss Baby

138,tonyum,"Bad, but funny",5,29 April 2017,"The boss baby, where can I begin, well let's start with the plot of the movie. The plot is about this boy named Tim who lives a happy life with his family, however a new baby comes to the family, and this baby turns out to be a business man that's against a corporation of puppies, so now the two brothers have to work together in order to discover their new plan: Forever puppy. Now let's get to the Pros: So the pros where, the humor, I really thought the humor was pretty funny, plus, the voice acting is pretty good too, plus, that fat baby (who is one of the boss baby's employees) his moments were the best in the whole movie, plus, the animation was OK. Now lets get to the Cons: So the Cons where it's plot, the plot in here is really lazy, but I'll one by one, first, there's the ""Person lived happy with his family, but a new person comes and steels the attention the person got"" plot, which is obviously recycled from Toy Story, also, let's hop into the beginning of the movie where we got the ""Where do babies come from"" plot, which is recycling the plot from Storks, it also has the ""Babies talk and live in this world of grown ups"" plot, which recycles the plot from Rugrats, we also got the""We work at an office"" which recycles the plot from the TV show The Office, now lets analyze the villain of the movie Francis Francis, and we learned that he is the boss baby's hero, but now he's a bad guy, which that's for UP, where Charles Muntz was Carl's hero, but he turns into the bad guy, it's the same here, another con were the parents of the movie, I mean seriously, they care more about the new guy instead of the first one, now I know this also happened with other people, but these parents are different, first off, they don't care that the baby cares a suitcase or wheres a suit, they don't think that's weird, they are all fine with that, another con was when the dad sad to Tim that the new baby needs all the attention, after hearing that sentence, I kinda thought that was mean spirited, and another con is that this movie is trying to be a cartoon, and what do I mean by that is because this thing of magic formula that babies drink just came out of nowhere with no explanation on how they did that. In the end, I thought this was bad, but it did have some funny moments. So that was my review of The Boss Baby, again, i didn't hate it, but for a studio like Dreamworks, is obviously that they can do better, hopefully Captain Underpants be good, because if it doesn't, then I'll say to Dreamworks that they completely have a problem.",The Boss Baby

Plus being fast-paced has the benefit of effectively distracting from the fact that the makers haven't been quite as effective as rivals Pixar in creating an emotional core to the story (see Up and Wall-E).The Boss Baby is no animation classic, but it is surprisingly fun, not only for kids, but also adults and especially those who are parents.

That being said it wasn't a terrible movie, it's just something that I can't see people liking too much.The movie is 97 minutes long (1h 37min) and I think it is too drawn out. This is a movie that I checked how much time was left on three separate occasions to see when I would be done watching it. This is clearly from the view point of an adult and not a child, but I am also a huge animation buff. I love cartoon anything as long as there is a good story involved. Children would like this movie because it is animated, it has children in it and silly moments. I can't help but feel like an animated movie classified as family, has to have something for the adults, that will ultimately be watching with children. That is where I think this movie falls flat. I hope that makes sense. As for the voice actors, they each did a great job. Clearly they are professionals and they play their parts well. You have Alec Baldwin playing the Boss Baby, who is meant to be a businessman so he fits perfectly. The protagonist is Steve Buscemi, playing Francis Francis. The mother and father are played by Lisa Kudrow and Jimmy Kimmel, respectively. Lastly in the big name category you have the brother Tim, and narrator being played by Tobey Maguire.Lets hear about the plot. I think it is a bit all over the place and they tried to jam too much into it, without developing most of it fully. It really had promise, but missed the mark for me. Anyway, this movie starts out with a happy family of three. Through the eyes of the creative child everything is perfect. One day a baby brother shows up wearing a suit and carrying a brief case. The older brother Tim sees this as odd and suspects that his new baby brother is up to something. He finds out that his brother is really a baby in management sent by Baby Corp, to dig up dirt about the company that Tim's parents work for, Puppy Co. The basis is that Babies and puppies are competitors, fighting for the majority share of love available in the world. Seems like a great concept that didn't go into great detail. The rest of the movie is about how the two pair up to stop the plan of the Puppy Co. CEO. Along they way their relationship grows, and evolves.I thought that they should have played more on theme of the creative child, Tim's, view of the baby coming into the lives of their family and playing the part of the ""boss"", by being so demanding as an infant and needing all of the attention. They did portray it but didn't develop it. It would have been neat if only through the eyes of Tim, we saw the baby in a suit. But sadly, he was just seen as a baby in a suit the whole time. It didn't really make sense. There are other times where only Tim knew what was going on and only he saw certain sides of Boss Baby, and that I liked. The movie seemed a bit too jumbled for me and it really didn't have anything for the older audience. this movie is still cute and well made, production wise. It will catch the eye and mind of some people just not everyone. I also have to disagree with it being placed in the genre of comedy as well. It really isn't funny, its cute, there is a difference. It has its silly moments but nothing to make you laugh out loud.To wrap it up the actors are great, and they should be. The production is great like it should be. The plot is there but, the themes are under developed. The audience for this movie would be children under the age of 12, which it is being rated as PG. There is nothing to keep the adults attention. This movie would be great to put on your TV and do house work while your kids watch it alone.**Disclaimer, before my rating let me list other movies that it is up against in the same genres**All listed with at least two of the three same genres, followed by their IMDb.com rating:Sing: 7.2The LEGO Batman Movie: 7.5Cars: 7.1Moana: 7.7Zootopia: 8.1The Lion King: 8.5Finding Dory: 7.4Toy Story: 8.3When you make a movie in these genres you are going up against the greats, and instant classics. That all being said I was not impressed with this movie, and for the genres that it is placed in I would give this movie a 5.9/10",The Boss Baby

The movie is so fabulous that it will not fail to entertain anyone.
The concept , script, everything is very unique and interesting.
Many say that it's a kid movie but I would not agree to it, it includes and portrays emotions which are so pure and deep that it's true meaning cannot be felt by kids but by adults and that's what makes this movie so special.
The animation is just fantastic, every expression is very clear, giving it a realistic vibe.
There is not even one thing in it which can be criticised.
Definitely a MUST WATCH!

148,jaymcguinness,"A Fun watch, one of the best animated movies of the decade",7,28 December 2018,"Dreamworks announced a sequel to The Boss Baby to be released in 2021 and it is no surprise. This was their biggest grossing debuting film since The Croods all the way back in 2011. They have relied on churning out sequels and creating a franchise out of How to Train Your Dragon, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar and Shrek for many years now.One of the key's to success for this film was the involvement of Tom McGrath as Director. He wrote and Directed the entire Madagascar franchise. He has been announced as the Director for The Boss Baby 2 also and he is yet to be involved in a bad movie with Dreamworks.Alec Baldwin was a great choice to voice The Boss Baby and the titular character is head and shoulders the best character in the movie. The casting of Lisa Kudrow as the mum did confuse me, she is a fantastic comedy performer but she had zero comedic lines throughout the movie. Also Tobey Maguire had little voice time as the narrator and seemed a strange choice. But most confusing was the casting of Steve Buscemi as one of the main villains Francis Francis. It is the strongest example I can think of a voice not suiting the actual character. The way the character looks and the way he might sound just didn't suit Buscemi to me.It is strange to me also that Hans Zimmer worked on the Soundtrack to this movie having been so used to his work on Inception and Interstellar. The ending song from Burt Bacharach is a very nice fit for this movie however.Overall, this is a fun movie, does provide several laughs and with Baldwin on board I think the sequel will also be a hit. 7/10",The Boss Baby
149,evgueny,Very pleased with my son's reaction to the film,7,29 April 2017,"I went to see this movie with my six-year old son. He has a baby sister and is rather familiar with sibling jealousy. While watching the film I thought that it was only slightly better than terrible because the story line was too complex for kids and too boring for adults. Moreover, my son felt pretty scared during a few episodes, which was quite contrary to my expectations, too. However, after we left the theater, he said that he had enjoyed the movie. He added that he was happy his sister was not a baby boss and that he loved her very much. As soon as we returned home, my son hugged and kissed our baby daughter. And before going to bed he said he wanted her to sleep with him in his room. So apparently the creators of this film got something right after all.",The Boss Baby
150,danny-fr-mail,"A cartoon, doing what cartoons do, and doing it well!",8,21 April 2017,"Some movies come up with a message, so do some cartoons. UP tackled the issue of loneliness, Frozen was a legit allegory for depression and how you should never leave your kid's education to trolls, and Boss Baby... well... has none. Okay, there is some kind of message, yes: don't so self-centered that you'll break the harmony of your awesome family, but that's ""standard movie message #948"" and there's no need to discuss it further. So, there is this kid, his life is all great as far as modern kid's standards go and, somehow, a supernatural, baby-shaped CEO hijacks his parents in order to pursue a secret mission which is revealed all over the trailer. The story unravels from there, completely disjointed, illogical, with the epic sort of surrealism that can sometimes emerge from the mind of a seven (and a half) year-old. That's where and why the movie really shines. Yes, there are some gross jokes here and there, but didn't we make them all when we were this age? The Boss Baby isn't an 'R' rated flick in disguise, it's a goofy, funny (not quite hilarious, but funny) story where ""Kill Bill"" minus all the snakes meets ""Tom & Jerry"", with a flurry of colors and motions as well as a quite daring art style (sometimes borrowing a tad from ""Kung-Fu Panda"" and ""Horton Hears a Who"").Technically, the animation is par with what's available these days, the score is okay, and the acting is actually good, with extra kudos for rather caricatured but very convincing facial expressions. Nothing in this movie makes sense, but nothing has to. It's refreshing, it's well paced, and it's a good way to spend a standard movie length of time. It will make you laugh on more than one occasion -if you don't take it too seriously, the flick itself doesn't, so why should you ;)",The Boss Baby
151,mtlabfall,"Not a masterpiece, but good entertainment with a heart",10,31 March 2017,"Boss Baby is not as introspectively original as Inside Out, as deep as Up, or as incisive as Wall-E.. BUT it is funny and heartwarming.Certainly it has a lot more laughs and is more engaging than Zootopia, which I thought was well-""drawn"" and had a decent story, but wasn't funny at all. I have to wonder if some of its high ratings are due to all the virtuous ""notes"" it hits with our society's current emphasis on social justice issues (not saying it's a bad thing, but I find that people give themes of diversity a lot of subjective credit that is not necessarily earned).BUT I digress.. Boss Baby has plenty of quality laugh-out-loud moments, and has humor that will appeal to kids and adults alike. There were also some very tender-hearted moments.. especially the boy's bedtime routine, it was so touching. Also the babies are way cuter than real babies (which is probably one reason I liked this film, because I'm not a big fan of actual babies).",The Boss Baby

156,letizia-margo,Adorable and funny,9,10 April 2017,"((Spoiler tag to be safe))First of all, whoever thought of Alec Baldwin voicing a baby deserves a reward because his performance brings so much dimension to the movie.Without spoiling anything, the animation team did well in the Boss Baby character. Even during sad/tense moments, somehow they manage to animate a very real and very much adult reaction to the baby that it really drives home that this is an adult in a baby's body. What really stood out to me was during a scene, the baby's shocked silence and body language was something that you would see in an adult, and in just those short seconds, you empathize with him.Even though a baby with an adult voice should be creepy, somehow through the perfect combination of animation style (round, cutesy and bright – this movie is brought to you by the shape circle) and the voice actors' brilliant acting, it's funny instead. It has the same slapstick humor that Dreamworks use in a lot of their animation so if that works for you, you'll love this!",The Boss Baby
157,Storywatcher,"Good for kids nowadays, clichéd for 90s kids",6,7 December 2017,"If you were a 90s kid and watched the famous 'Rugrats' you'll find it amusing, entertaining and funny but somewhat mediocre. Personally, I'm usually disappointed as the animation industry focus too much in short-term attention-seeking rather than long-term classic immortality. There were some comical remarks that are plausible but somehow I couldn't fall in love with the movie as it got predictable. It doesn't matter how old you are to love it, I firmly believe children nowadays have a vast repertory of animated movies to watch and can compare one from the others.",The Boss Baby

To be honest, I feel like Alex Baldwin fits the role for 'The boss baby'. I actually don't see how anyone else can fit the role for him. The animation is good and appealing (I guess). The voice acting is okay, and the story is fine.Again, I'm on the fence with this one. I guess it's okay. I recommend this film. I give it a 5 out of 10 stars.

The imagination scenes are great, the animiation crew went all out on it, Alec Baldwin channeled his 30 Rock voice into the Boss Baby. The themes of chidhood and the way children see new siblings, in fact I remember this sorta when my younger sister was born. 
It feels stretched at times, I personally could've done without the airplane scene which just seemed to be filler ""character devolpment"", thankfully this scene is really short but my first viewing (yes, I've seen this more than once) felt sooooo boringbut after a couple more viewings it's seemingly lessened.

The story is about a baby who is supernaturally intelligent and teams up with his seven year old brother to stop the CEO of Puppy Co. I'm going to say this right now and i'm sure everyone else is too if they have any brain cells whatsoever, this movie is a masterpiece, yes that's right a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I can see in the future everyone hailing this as a classic of the ages. The two extremely talented directors Hendel Butoy and Tom McGrath have exquisitely made a true and proper film of the ages. A perfect score because it obviously deserves it in every single way, if there would be a movie i would marry it would be The Boss Baby. In fact a 10/10 seems a bit low....It really deserves much much more than just a perfect score it really deserves it's very own religion. If there was any religion I would follow it would be Thebossbabyism. The Boss Baby is of course the very best movie of all time and NEEDS to the #1 movie on the IMDb Top 250 list, The Shawshank Redemption should be kicked off and be replaced with The Boss Baby where it truly belongs",The Boss Baby

I really loved the look of the film, I thought it had a really nice aesthetic style and felt like a classic piece of animation that if CGI was around in the seventies, it would've looked like this. All in all, I personally loved this film. If you want something that's just plain fun, bizarre and imaginative- with a touch of warmth- I'd say check this flick out.

The jokes in this movie are cringy and immature, only little kids will probably laugh at this. It has tons of references like ""Lord of the Rings"" trying to relate to the viewer, even some adult jokes.

It's target audience are little kids, who I believed were thoroughly enjoying it in the cinema where I had been. It was fun, imaginative and very very cute. I don't understand why kids films have to face such a harsh criticism. It reflects a common adult attitude to keep kids under their control.

However, I watched this quite late at night one night, while drinking lots of water. I can pleasantly say that I was surprised with this movie. I expected it to be a WHOLE lot worse than it actually was. The story was predictable, the animation was fine, but the thing for me that really made me give it a 7 was how the scenes transitioned from each other. That was something I really found unique, as I never really see movies that connect a story through one simple element that is common throughout the story. Props to the people involved for a movie that unexpectedly made me shocked that it was better than it was supposed to be.

Nothing much new about the flow of the story compare to most if not all all of the animated movis I have watched which is not bad at all. As someone who is 23 years old I actually liked the movie and the main idea or conflict in the movie is unfortunately reflects to what most people think these days which is scary. So if you picking a movie alone or with someone or with family with any age I think this is a good choice. It always nice to bring back the child part of us once in a while.,The Boss Baby
201,kb-13344,"A boring, unsubstantial and cringy film",2,3 July 2017,"Boss Baby, the movie which could have been a very good animated comedy lost itself in the sea of dumbness. The storyline is so bad that it won't even qualify as a dumb animated movie made for kids. The plot is clichéd with the baby in the twist, st the times when the comedic moments were to give laughter they were cringy at best. The animation is generic and some of the characters are somewhat indistinguishable from the previous dreamworks movies. It contains your regular dreamworks jokes like fart, penis jokes which aren't funny anymore.",The Boss Baby
202,dreygo-93509,My Peasant Life?,3,18 October 2017,"Wake up little halflings, it's time to leave. Go and live your peasant lives. BEGONE WITH YOU!These are the last words to a solidly mediocre movie starring Baldwin, Kimmel, Kudrow, Buscemi and Maguire called Boss Baby. Most of these actors I genuinely like and appreciate. I feel like Dreamworks though, took a dump in my mouth and hopes that I don't realize what I am eating. Do they just despise being forced to do such broad based comedy that they are mad at the ""peasants""? I know, I knowI am reading too much into this line. But there is no way that there isn't meaning and intention behind this final cut scene. There are lots of ways to say goodbye in a movie. Some clever and some condescending. If you spend the money to put this specific scene in a spot where most will not see it, and those that do will likely not care, to what end is it done? Maybe they know this thing is crap, but still wish to cling to the notion that they are not. My guess is that most of the big names involved in this adventure in potty humor are always publicly praising the ""little guy"" who they wouldn't dare call a peasant to their face. They seem to despise my family, and the rest of us that exist within this vast ocean of mediocrity. I realize that raising your head just a little higher than that ocean is extremely difficult. Unfortunately, this movie weighs like an anchor on the soul of everyone involved.Most of the talent and executives will probably smile to themselves with self-satisfaction as hundreds of millions of dollars are almost guaranteed to roll in from the purse of these peasants. I now hate myself for being one of them. The moment I saw that cut scene, I regretted ever allowing my children the indulgence of such garbage. Take my money and spit in my face toogalling.",The Boss Baby

205,taconerd,"Like a rattle. Fun at first, then it gets annoying and then downright awful",7,9 December 2020,"Alright. So, I might as well start with the positives, because this movie isn't all bad.-The best thing about this movie is the score. Hans Zimmer adds a lemotif to ""Baby brother."" to almost every song and it just WORKS.-Animation was pretty decent. I liked the bits in Tim's imagination. They did an excellent job of mixing 2d and 3d. Well done, Dreamworks.Now for my biggest problem.
This movie has basically no direction, until about the halfway point. Boss Baby says he has nothing was his boss calls. Of course he doesn't! He's been screwing around with Tim ever since he got there! Most of the movie is just these two fighting or talking with each other. There were a lot things injected into the story that I sorta didn't like (Looking at you, Eugene.)
In conclusion, Boss Baby manages to be an interesting experience, but it isn't the best at its story. Probably due to whatever drunken studio exchange led to this premise becoming an OSCAR NOMINATED FILM.I give this Movie a solid 7/10. Hopefully, the kids can rest easy.",The Boss Baby

211,davidrez,In one word? Disappointment !,1,31 May 2017,"I really had some expectations to enjoy this movie and I really tried hard to enjoy it so I had patience but I think after 40-45 minutes I understood how awful, childish, boring and without any potential that movie. Something in that movie just didn't work for me! A very superficial plot, BORING, not to mention that wasn't amusing or funny. I understand how the film expresses the rich imagination of a small child who needs exclusive attention from his parents and is jealous when a new baby arrives in the family... and yeah, the twist here is when it's not a regular baby. OK. BUT: couldn't they just done it INTERESTING?! AMUSING?! I've turned it off after 45 minutes !!! I just was so disappointed and mostly bored!!! I felt like I'm in the kinder garden babysitting a group of little ones and i felt i just forcing myself to watch that stupid childish plot and forcing my self-enjoying it which i totally DIDN'T! OMG... what the producers thought to them selves? Did they had the attention to amuse all the family or just babies? Little kids? I'm not sure... It doesn't happen me a lot that I'm turning off a movie after a few minutes of watching... and when it does happen I'm so pieced off! From my experience, such kind of films are expected to be amusing and entertaining for the whole family and it seems as if the producers were only concerned with pointing to the audience of small children – which is not fair at all! There are these channels of toddlers where all sorts of programs are specially designed for them, for preschoolers, and that's exactly how it felt to me. As if I were babysitting my nephew and watching with him that channel. Something here missed this film, something that does not appeal to an older audience who also wants to enjoy a comedy film. Very childish and naive elements exist in that film. I don't think I was too much tired when I watch it, I just was feeling BORED from it. DreamWorks hey, you just have to admit it: this time it just didn't work for you. You had better films and really enjoying. I'm not surprised why it received such a low score on the IMDb website. You know there's this moment in the show when you watch it that you're telling to yourself: ""ok what am I doing?! Why am I wasting my time of that?"" that was exactly the feeling. I wouldn't be surprised that I would really enjoy it if for example I would have been 6-10 years old but not when I'm 33! I felt like the screenwriters weren't creative, weren't witty. A shallow plot that shows how the child of the family has an interest in receiving the exclusive and loving attention of his parents and the special baby has another interest (I will not be a spoiler) and for the sake of the matter they cooperate together. Perhaps the idea of this is cute but they could done it amusing, again, to the whole family and not just to small children! When creating films of this kind you have to think about how everyone can enjoy and not just a specific target audience because that's how it felt the whole movie: only my nephews were sure to enjoy it. Only the friends of my nephews from kindergarten. A movie that is very suitable for the toddler channel on television. There is a very embarrassing feeling for the adult viewer watching this film. An embarrassing feeling of childishness that is unpleasant. A feeling that is shameful and very strange, losing interest after a few minutes of watching. A certain understanding that this is a film that will be suitable only for young children. My expectation was so different! It seems that this time DREAMWORKS decided that they were more likely to pamper the audience of the little kids than adults, or that the scriptwriter or scriptwriters of the film missed that many adults like to watch animated films. What did they think to themselves? That if in the plot there will be a baby who is an adult then this is it? Is this a movie directed at the whole family? The fact is that it did not work on me. On the contrary - I was most disappointed! What still disturbed me is the movie's trailer: a comic film, supposedly fun for the whole family, a sweeping plot, fascinating, amusing, funny but actually - getting the most childish film, boring, no interest, without any enthusiasm. I think the film simply appeals to a target audience of young children to educate them about something called ""sharing."" To pay attention, to love, to play, to have a good relationship and to teach not to be selfish, possessive, to know that sibling relationships are very important. Maybe that's why I lost interest and I would not be surprised if other adults watching the movie felt the same way. Simply lack of interest or enthusiasm. I really hope that the producers, screenwriters and anyone who worked on the plot and the film will read the negative reviews on this site so that they will learn lessons and know for the future that if they want to create more animated films, they will know a much wider target audience and not take this approach knowingly or not. It is good that such a site exists to give honest opinions about films and series. The film industry needs to maintain a professional line of permanent entertainment for its customers. Unfortunately, anyone who asks me about the film will I'll give him my honest and negative opinion. And so, I say to everyone: ""If you have a little boy, he'll enjoy it. are you? Definitely not!"" Too bad. A potential plot that could have been much more fascinating, interesting, entertaining and amusing for the whole family. Not just for toddlers.",The Boss Baby

Much more entertaining than other well-known movies (which have a higher score on imdb and better criticism) as Frozen or Coco (Oscar nominee, competing with The Baby Boss, and yet less entertaining in my opinion).
The plot is not the most profound but it is impossible not to sympathize with the protagonists, especially if you have any siblibgs. Probably you will feel identified.
As for animation and art, if you are a little observant, you will notice how art ""style"" changes when the child is in one of his fantasies. It is really interesting and beautiful to see.
I give it an 8/10 because it is a very good movie, but definitely not the best of dreamworks.
In conclusion, I think it is an excellent option if you want to watch something with the family. Very enjoyable, fun and entertaining. Interesting because of the creativity.

The dynamic between Tim and Boss Baby is overdone, with their chemistry being the whole ""first they don't like each other, now they do, and then we separate them, and finally they get back together again"" spiel. If you've seen any other animated film with this type of chemistry, you'd already know how this goes. Plus, their obligatory separation because plot is resolved really quickly, making it pointless as a result.It doesn't help either when the comedy itself is incredibly weak, making this really boring, which you definitely don't want to happen with an animated comedy.

Many scenes in the movie evolve around the idea that Tim is a very imaginative kid, and the way they are presented really makes you believe that nothing is actually happening (the backyard action scene, or that one with the pacifiers). Tim can easily build complex scenarios where he is the hero of the story and saves the day. Maybe just as ""Inside Out"" could be just the projections of a kid going into puberty, maybe ""Baby Boss"" plot is just the rhetorical device of a boy who doesn't want a little brother, but ends up loving his company.Either way, it was a very entertaining movie.

242,apehole,Predictable (Not in a good way.),4,29 April 2017,"I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, seeing from the trailers I knew it was going to be another cliché Dreamworks film. Not cliché as in 'it's been done before' (Though this obviously isn't the first instance of a child acting like an adult for humor) Cliché as in formulaic, the kid (Tim) having the same issues of the fear of being forgotten or abandoned (Toy Story, Inside Out) Even before the Boss Baby was introduced, it was pretty obvious how it was going to play out. The kid has an overactive imagination, he imagines the baby is taking over his home life, and it resolves with the baby acting like a normal baby. And that's exactly what happens, albeit in a more complicated way, but in a nutshell. The only redeeming thing from this movie were the visuals, more specifically at the beginning when Tim was playing make believe, it felt cartoony and alive. The whole movie felt animated, which is always nice to see in a kids movie. For the most part, a majority of the scenes always had nice atmospheres and color theory at play. The main characters, however, look pretty generic and uninteresting. The humor in the movie falls flat, but that's subjective. The movie theater I was in (Which was pretty barren) didn't seem all that interested in the movie, either. I only heard people laugh at TWO scenes, out of the entire movie. I guess if you throw garbage at a wall, somethings bound to stick. Speaking of humor, some of the jokes in the film were a bit out of place and just awkward in general. The climax of the film was okay, it didn't stray too far from the ridiculousness of the film's tone. Nothing really stood out visually, and the apparent attempt at a tear-jerking scene was a bit stale, since they'd already established the whole 'business babies never had families'Overall, good until the moment the Boss Baby actually shows up.",The Boss Baby

245,cloroxbleachyesdrinkit,Great movie,10,9 April 2017,"I really liked the movie, I want to say it is a great movie for kids about the age of 6, between 12. I do nit know why the movie got bad reviews, it seems like some people did not like it, the only thing I didn't like about this movie, was there were too many naked butts in the movie. But the movie was great for kids, we had fun watching it :) Strongly recommend watching Boss Baby!",The Boss Baby
246,imcoopertheboss,Great Movie,10,10 April 2017,"I don't understand how this movie got so many negative reviews. I went and saw this yesterday and honestly, its one of the best movies I have EVER seen. The plot is funny and progresses intently while the characters develop and come together in common interest. This movie is absolutely hilarious and also heart warming. I 10/10 recommend this",The Boss Baby
247,begumsahana,Why you should watch this movie,10,11 April 2017,"I loved this movie! The person who created this is so loved. I did shed a few tears somewhere near the end but this is awesome. I loved the bit where boss baby calls from the other side and asks to open the door. Quite emotional. And of course, the ending. Super sad and happy. I recommend watching this movie, and rating it a 10.",The Boss Baby
248,ahmadturkme,so funny,9,21 February 2020,"Loved it, so funny, made me laugh, awesome for both old and young viewers, would totally watch it again with any group of people.",The Boss Baby
249,marcos-38003,An Excellent Movie .,10,1 May 2017,"An excellent movie is a movie that you could see over and over again, not a movie that wins a Oscar, or a movie that makes a lot of money. It's a movie that you personally can watch over and over again. The Boss Baby, to me, is a measure of an excellent movie. And I would watch it again.",The Boss Baby
250,varadgauns,Great and Awesome movie,10,23 May 2017,"the movie was awesome.I really enjoyed watching this film.The movie is absolutely hilarious and heart warming.The characters which are used in this movie are also awesome.this is the best movie ever made.Great movie fr d kids above the age of 6, bet 12. Strongly recommend watching Boss Baby..",The Boss Baby
251,JoelMatsui,Transparent,3,2 July 2017,"The movie is a bit transparent with its easy predictable plot and holes. There way are too many unexplained but though weird events that happened which makes it hard to watch. For example: Why is the baby dressed and well delivered by a taxi? How come that the parents never found out about the true existence of the Boss Baby even though the clue's were too obvious.I know it is an animated comedy, but there are still way to many errors for an movie that had the potential to become something way better than this. Computer and editing work is great, sound and music is mwua, but I just don't really like the plot and its fly blown humor.",The Boss Baby
252,rishidaboss,Great movie for kids,6,21 July 2017,"Now, for the diaper galore film involving a young boy and his new baby brother teaming up to defeat an evil businessman. "" BOSS BABY"" This DreamWorks film is twisted together in a slightly confusing story-line. The Boss Baby is a colorful animated film that's complete with a sibling rivalry highlighting biased affection.Tim is a young imaginative boy with his head always in the clouds. He doesn't see the world the same way anyone else does and that's one special thing his parents share with him. Leading to the five-minute introduction of a seven-year-old boy pretending to be a pirate.A slight over explanation of the time his parents spend with him. Now, the story really begins once his younger brother arrives in a business suit and a briefcase..already able to walk. A little strange don't you think. And the craziest thing is that his parents seem to think it's wait for it CUTE! Not strange but apparently cute. If I saw a three- day old baby walking in a suit, I would probably have to be admitted into a psychiatric hospital. Tim resents the arrival of his younger brother.Roll credits BOSS BABY. Who dominates the time and love of his parents.Which then leads the story along baby meetings and lawnmower fights. And as you would expect, entertaining for kids. Kids and infants will most likely enjoy this film from the classic slapstick and awkward toilet humor. Not to mention the occasional comedic set pieces. Personally, the main thing that made me laugh was that a sixty-year-old man was voicing a.baby. Some entertaining moments, however, included the quarrels between the ""siblings"" and how gullible the parents are to not notice. Brutally hilarious however was when Tim's little brother rolls down a flight of stairs into the middle of the street.Tim's fertile imagination is open to a plethora of ideas as he deals with the introduction of a new family member. This could and should have been elaborated on just to showcase some of the things we'd like to think little kids do when they're left alone. Again, an interesting topic that could have changed the entire movie. Instead, we get repetitive chase sequences, continuous ironic moments when parents don't notice what's going on, and an entire movie based off of what may offend dog lovers.The Animation, however, was quite outstanding and I loved the personality of the chubby muscular baby. So it's a win-win scenario if you're looking for some good laughs.",The Boss Baby
253,buzanga-49252,"This movie defines ""Bad"".",1,23 July 2017,"This movie is not worth a long review. Just avoid it. Can't give it a 0 ... I respect the people who like it but personally i found it extremely bad. Unfortunately i need 5 lines of text so here it goes : saw about 15-20 minutes of it; storyline is incredibly bad. It seems to be related to the normal ""initial resistance"" that a big brother has to the new baby in the house ... but the way it does it is bad. Not funny. Maybe it gets better after half an hour, i don't know - didn't have the stomach to waste my time with it.",The Boss Baby
254,xanderrjones,probably the best movie i've ever seen in my diddly darn life,10,29 July 2017,"the boss baby is like the best darn film ever, holy heck. every single poop joke was like the funniest thing in history ever, oh boy. the animation is beautiful, the movements are all fluid and the stylized view of tim's imagination is gorgeously portrayed. also they make a joke about the boss baby getting a binky stuck up his little boss butt within the first five minutes, so you know it's gonna be a doozy. speaking of the boss baby's butt, there are a fair few shots of it in the movie. hearing alec baldwin's voice come out of a character and then seeing his little baby butt is probably the best moment in all of filmmaking history. anyway yeah its basically the best movie ever, definitely watch this movie at least 50 times.",The Boss Baby
255,Rey_M,This comedy brings out your inner child,8,9 August 2017,"This was actually a very good comedy.At first I thought that it would be like most other cartoon movies,but this actually combines adult humor with children jokes.This movie is like watching family guy combined with a kid's show to make a funny but unharmful type of movie.If you want a movie that reminds of what it's like to be a child,then this is it.",The Boss Baby
256,agdfurniturephotography,A movie kids and adults can enjoy,9,11 August 2017,"I was shocked to learn that this movie only got 51% from a different movie review page. The first time i watched it i thought it was cute and my kids liked it so whatever. The next time i watched it with my kids i noticed all these things i hadn't seen before. Like how the rocket, mousetrap, train and other action sequences were all toys in Tim's room and the entire movie was the way a 7 year old viewed adjusting to having a baby brother. That's something that both kids and adults can relate to and made this a very sweet movie.",The Boss Baby
257,sexrichard,Great movie for siblings.,10,22 December 2017,"My son loves this movie, helps that he has a baby brother also. Very cute!",The Boss Baby
258,vedulasiva,awsome,10,25 December 2017,"Hearttouching movie,good i want to see part 2,the action of baby is good and his brother action also.the story is so beautifull.",The Boss Baby
259,vojnovictin,The Boss Baby,7,3 October 2020,"Film is good and interesting, but it doesnt have any work (I think that you must have a fluid in films)",The Boss Baby
260,richieralf,One of the best KIDS movie!,10,25 August 2018,I would rate this 10/10. How could someone ever ever give a negative rating for this movie.,The Boss Baby
261,freddysanjaya,I see director and team spirit in this movie,8,3 March 2019,"The story starts with Tim's imagination. I think it makes sense to me if the story is full of something that can't relate to the real world. Well, this is how the imagination child perspective movie tells. This movie contains tickling laughter and full of the ""mood color"" that fascinating a lot (for me).
This is a heartwarming story even though there is an unreasonable story on how Tim and the baby get rid of the Puppy Forever Company. But the moral of the story is sweet. I can relate it to my siblings.
Maybe this movie does not get into the child's thoughts because they are still in the ""conflict"" hahaha. So, I would like to recommend this movie to the young teen or moreover people who want to get nostalgic with their childhood.",The Boss Baby
