0,Leofwine_draca,Acceptable throwback to 1970s-style film-making,6,18 December 2016,"A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is an interesting thriller that acts as a deliberate throwback to the gritty realism of the 1970s. I liked it and thought it was an above average film, although perhaps not the masterpiece that some are making it out to be. The twist of this story is that it plays out as a gangster epic along the lines of SCARFACE and THE GODFATHER although the character's main line of business is strictly legal.Oscar Isaac is an acceptable leading presence although he's not the most charismatic of our leading men; I find something a little cold about it compared to someone like Pacino. Still, this film is mainly about the twists and turns of the plot and the assured direction, all of which work well. A MOST VIOLENT YEAR feels slow-paced at times and there isn't much action, although some of the set-pieces which do occur are very explosive. Jessica Chastain is shrill in support but the reliable Elyes Gabel is typically excellent and bag's the film's most interesting and conflicted character. In the end, the story has enough suspense and tension, alongside some very real threats and danger, to see it through to the affecting climax.",A Most Violent Year
1,SnoopyStyle,neo-gangster movie,8,14 November 2015,It's 1981 NYC. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) owns a fuel delivery company that was purchased from his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain)'s father. He's trying to close a deal to buy a fuel terminal. He tries to do things the most right way but it's struggle in a corrupt industry. Somebody keeps hijacking his fuel trucks and driver Julian (Elyes Gabel) is severely injured. D.A. Lawrence (David Oyelowo) doesn't care. He's tasked with cleaning up the industry and has set his sights on Abel. He is charging Abel mostly due to Anna's corrupt father. Abel has to scramble to get the money for the terminal before he loses his deposit.I love the fact that this is a gangster except Abel is desperately trying not to be a gangster. Also fuel oil delivery is not the usual backdrop but it works. Oscar Isaac does an amazing job. Some may find the lack of action problematic although there is one great car chase scene. I find the concentration on business really fascinating. His need to raise capital is quite intense. It's a different kind of action. It all works.,A Most Violent Year
2,Horst_In_Translation,Oil crime in 1981 New York,6,3 April 2015,"""A Most Violent Year"" is the newest movie by director J.C. Chandor and as with his previous works, he also wrote this one. It's his third film and I also liked his previous work ""All Is Lost"". The central character is played by Oscar Isaac (who I loved as Llewyn Davis) and he fully delivers once again. He makes the character his own and delivers a great portrayal of determination. In the trailer, I somehow had the impression he would be a criminal, but nope. Quite the opposite actually despite several references about a dark past. Golden Globe nominee Jessica Chastain plays her role well too and this can basically be said about almost everybody in the cast.The movie has some very tense moments, such as when he chases the one criminal (and lets him go as he realizes those people are really victims too) or when a pair of criminals try to take over another truck, but the driver is armed. We see how they end up as brothers in misery and even help the driver after the police is behind them. If there is anything I did not really totally enjoy here (apart from Oyelowo's role being too insignificant compared to his talent), it's maybe the suicide scene at the end. They tried to go out with a bang and great moment, but I may have preferred a more quiet and subtle ending. Still the hole with the oil pouring out and Isaac's performance in that scene were top-notch too. So, of course I enjoyed this film and the rating is only 6 stars because I have no real urge to rewatch it anytime soon. but still, I very much recommend watching it. Isaac is phenomenal right now and the kind of crime in this film is one about which I have never seen a film before.",A Most Violent Year
3,kosmasp,Can you be good?,9,23 June 2015,"This movie is a slow burner if there is one. For some it might feel like the biggest drag and one of the most boring movies they've seen. Not much seem to happen in the first half of the movie. It is important though, not only to set the tone, but to introduce and flesh out the characters. Also making it clear what our main character has to deal with. External and internal things tearing him apart.All the while trying to maintain a certain attitude and not going over to the dark side (and all that without a Yoda by his side). Oscar Isaac gives a performance that is worthy of his first name. The mood the film creates (no fast edits/cuts, cinematography to fall in love with, even if it's more in the dark spectrum or because it is) is phenomenal. If you stick with it, it will be rewarding ...",A Most Violent Year
4,classicsoncall,"""I've always been a lot more afraid of failure than of anything else.""",8,25 January 2019,"It was kind of difficult relating to the character of Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), he was getting ripped off left and right but didn't want to retaliate in a manner that would have matched his enemies. His wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) grew up in a family that handled things directly with force, and that caused some friction between the married couple. Even though Abel maintained a stoic resolve throughout the story to maintain a semblance of integrity, you couldn't help but feel that there was some undercurrent of corruption in his own business, but you would never know it by his actions. But you got a sense of it when the Feds came calling and there was a mad dash to hide the company's business records. Other than Anna's confession that she was skimming the books ever since she began handling the financial end, there was nothing outwardly crooked about the way the business was being run.I had a bad feeling about that one million dollar down payment to the Hasidics in a deal that could have gone horribly wrong and almost did. Relative to the other million and a half Abel had to come up with, it was intriguing how a couple of his competitors like old Saul (David Margulies) and Peter Forente (Alessandro Nivola) came through to give him a hand. It felt like an 'honor among thieves' commitment to keep one of their own going. But it was funny to me when Abel confronted all the oil men at the meeting, and just like Obama telling Putin to 'cut it out' over Russian hacking, he told the assembled group to knock off the business with the truck hijackings. Like any of them were about to listen unless some kind of heat was turned up on the bunch.So all the while as Abel's trucks kept getting picked off, his driver Julian (Elyes Gabel) sought for a shootout on the Brooklyn Bridge, and the desperate time frame to come up with cash he needed, I was quite literally waiting for that Straw Dogs moment when he would go berserk and just start taking out anyone who got in his way. It was somewhat frustrating actually, to see him biding his time and working things out in his own way. I guess I've been conditioned by too many 'real' gangster flicks to accept the idea that Abel would have been as passive as he was.The topper on all this though comes at the very end when the District Attorney (David Oyelowo) investigating Abel showed up at the newly purchased waterfront property and more than casually hinted that he was open for business himself in terms of future backing for his political ambitions. That was pretty much an affirmation that Abel was going to have to go along to get along with the seamy side of the business in order to grow and prosper. As for the picture's title, inquiring minds like to know, so I looked it up. 1981 indeed was New York City's most violent year if measured by it's one hundred twenty thousand reported robberies, an all time record. Though murders were slightly down from the prior year, it did seem unlikely back then that the city would ever reverse it's steadily increasing crime rate,",A Most Violent Year
5,lee_eisenberg,Abel and Anna entail both a contrast and a comparison,6,8 December 2015,"J. C. Chandor's third movie looks at New York City in the crime-ridden early 1980s. Oscar Isaac's businessman finds himself forced to take drastic financial and physical action due to competition from rival companies, and hijackings of trucks.One thing that caught my eye was the comparison/contrast between Abel (Isaac) and Anna (Jessica Chastain). He looks like a hard-boiled type, while she looks innocent and delicate. But when talking, she turns out to be as tough as he is. A person would have to be tough to survive in this sleazy, corrupt world that Abel and Anna inhabit.All in all, ""A Most Violent Year"" is one impressive movie. As with ""Margin Call"", Chandor shows the effects that a slimy world has on individuals. I recommend it.Also starring Albert Brooks, Alessandro Nivola, Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria in ""Maria Full of Grace""), David Oyelowo (Martin Luther King Jr. in ""Selma""), and David Margulies (the mayor in ""Ghostbusters"").One of the characters mentioned the number of murders that New York saw in 1980. I immediately realized that included John Lennon.",A Most Violent Year
6,Quinoa1984,a slow-burn dramatic masterwork,10,31 January 2015,"J.C. Chandor in three films has proved himself a truly versatile filmmaker. Margin Call - All is Lost - now with A Most Violent Year, the three don't seem much alike (a wall street drama about the financial collapse; a man stuck in the ocean at his wits end; a man trying to hold on to his crumbling business). But they are all about a similar thread, which is men trying to stay alive the only way they know how. Trading the large ensemble of Margin Call to the one-man-band approach of Lost, we now come to a middle ground of a small group of characters, and they're always compelling to watch. I should say, in correction partly, the lead character Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), who in the course of a couple of weeks sees everything he has starting to crumble: a new business venture he's been working for years to get (a major piece of waterfront property), indictments pending (good old investigator with his own political side played by David Owoyelo), and problems with his oil-truck drivers being hijacked and beaten. Oh, and his wife. Jessica Chastain. Wow.The whole movie can be summed up with 'wow'. But the title is a little deceptive for those who are rushing to see it out of the thought it's got a lot of what it entails. Not really. This is violent in the way that Lumet's Prince of the City or one of his gritty New York city thrillers were: it's mostly people talking, trying to be calm, trying to rationalize, and yet there's always the sense that something sinister is at work, of a paranoia with the criminal elements at play.What makes it so engrossing for me is the consequences, the stakes for this character of Abel. He is not someone easily pushed around, but he's not a nasty, bad man. At the least he doesn't see himself that way and doesn't carry that kind of thuggish criminal weight. He's a businessman, a family man, running it with his wife running the accounting controls (which is a whole other kettle of fish, of course).But you can only care about this character inasmuch as how the actor inhabits him, and Isaac gets completely under this guy's skin. He has a charm though, which is unexpected and just right. It may be hard to see as the man, through much of 'Violent Year', is under stress and pressure, trying to keep his calm and only getting outbursts around his wife and those he just can't control anymore. Even with his employee, the driver, who is also in his own bind following an incident with guns on a highway, he keeps that eye-contact (his character has a whole scene, probably the one where the audience can most connect with him, where he talks about the eye contact), and you believe where he's coming from. No BS. And Isaac makes this guy the real deal.It's the story of the sympathetic gangster, in other words. Or is he a gangster? He wouldn't see himself as that, despite the home he lives in or the money that may/may not be legit, the heat from the law, the connection through his father in law (we only hear briefly about this, but it's just enough to paint the picture). But Isaac makes this conflict palpable and hard not to connect with, especially as every moment you wonder 'could this be it, the person around the corner going to get him?' Maybe that's what the title refers to: the idea of violence and mayhem all around someone trying to be the eye of the storm, the calm. ""I'm only afraid of failure,"" he says at one point, and it would be one of those cliché platitudes, but he means it. So, too, do his adviser (Albert Brooks, nigh unrecognizable at first in the best way for an actor, who also carries a level of calm and control, though the violence is underneath there too), and his wife.Together Isaac and Chastain, to make one of those critical tropes, light up the screen. And it's such a dark movie that it sounds ridiculous, but they work incredibly well together, lifting up an already superb script by Chandor. One might wonder for a split second why the story starts right here, that we don't get to see much of what's happened in the 70's when they build up this (shady?) business. No need. It's all their in their looks, the way they talk to each other, the tense exchanges around a loaded gun discovered on their front lawn, or missing money or just the general state of things. But, ultimately, the actors play it that they only have each other now, and they better be able to put up or shut up. It's characters with immense internal and external conflicts, and players who latch on to them like barnacles to an ocean floor.And the direction is slick and powerful while not having to ""do"" much, which also goes back to Lumet. Doing just what's needed for the scenes is fine, and sometimes, usually, Chandor goes a little further and it works perfectly. In other words, this is a coolly directed film, and it's just what the material requires. When a chase happens, it's a rush. When characters have to talk and square things off, the faces can say so much more, but paced so that there's time to take in the words. It's elegant and thoughtful filmmaking at a time when so many thrillers and even dramas rush things from moment and moment and beat to beat. By the time you get to the end, you feel like you've been on a journey through the depths of survival. Like his other films, only, this time somehow, better.",A Most Violent Year
7,michaelRokeefe,Business; it is all business!,6,31 August 2015,"J.C. Chandler writes and directs this crime drama about one of New York City's historically dangerous and crime-filled years. It is blue ass cold in the winter of 1981. Immigrant Abel Morales(Oscar Isaac)and his wife Anna(Jessica Chastain)are trying to operate a successful business on the docks of NYC. The ambitious Morales finds himself in a major bind for cash flow to purchase some property to advance his business. He has always striven to operate on the up-and-up in order to leave a respectable legacy. When rumors cause the bank to renege on a promise of a business loan, Abel is forced to enter into some loans from people that he has always tried to stay away from. ""Robbing Peter-to-pay Paul"" is nothing to brag about and Mrs. Morales becomes frightened for her family when unsavory muscle begins to show. As expected, some rough language and graphic, disturbing violence will earn this movie an R rating. The acting is fine, but you seem to have to wait for something to really happen. A bunch of shots of the New York City skyline does not a movie make. The intentions are good, but more is expected and not delivered. I like the using of ""Inner City Blues"" by Marvin Gaye. Other music provided by Ray Bryant, Alex Ebert and Cia Italia.Also in the cast: Elyes Gabel, Jerry Adler, Christopher Abbott, David Oyelowo, Matthew Maher and Albert Brooks.",A Most Violent Year
8,sunwarrior13,It Requires Full Attention And Discernment To Appreciate It,10,28 June 2015,"A Most Violent Year stars former Julliard students Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain that revolves about an immigrant who is facing a lot of challenges from all fronts of his life during a time that was considered ""the most violent year"" period in New York City back in the 1980's.This extraordinary and thought-provoking movie was written and directed by J.C. Candor.It is 1981 in New York City.Abel Morales is the business owner of Standard Heating Oil.His trucks are being hijacked.He also is entering a business transaction wherein he is going to purchase a business property that he needs to close in 30 days.He already has the loan from the bank approved but he faces tough problems when the bank canceled after he is suddenly charged with felony and misconduct from the District Attorney's office.Things also become worrisome at home when an intruder came at his new home and when his wife saw his young daughter carrying a loaded gun that was left behind.A viewer must fully focused instead of being half-awake or better yet has only half attention to it while watching to fully appreciate the beauty of this film.Much of the events happens through the dialogues of the characters involved.Also,the people involved in the screenplay have character depth and are complex that their actions are unpredictable as the story progress.The cast involved is definitely wonderful especially the lead stars who have great chemistry and provide a great performance that would result into the viewer to be fully drawn into their characters and to discern the actions they have taken as the story progressed despite the fact that it was talky film. In the end,this is one great movie that would require full attention and discernment to authentically appreciate its beauty.",A Most Violent Year
9,Theo Robertson,Contains A Great Sense Of Time And Place,7,29 March 2015,"By staggering coincidence after seeing 12 YEARS A SLAVE which documented life as a slave in 19th Century America the next film I saw was A MOST VIOLENT YEAR which chronicles life as immigrant in 20th Century America . I say staggering coincidence but 12 YEARS is a true story where A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is a fictional drama but they're both gloomy films that sees literal outsiders as protagonists in the dark side of America The setting is New York City 1981 and the title comes from the fact 1981 was a peak year for crime in NYC . New York has a certain mystique for outsiders , probably down to the fact that many of the more distinctive and downbeat film makers such as Lumet and Scorsese have set their films there ? There is the perception that as soon as you get off at a bus stop in New York the first person you're going to meet is a murderer , a rapist , a mugger or some deranged vigilante to wants to cleanse the streets like a rain by torturing and executing criminal scum . The NYPD are useless at catching criminals down to the fact that the only people they arrest are prostitutes wearing feather boas .That's not to say A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is a vigilante movie . It's a dark crime drama where the emphasis is on drama . Emphasis on dark too because what happens is characters stand around in dark rooms speaking gritty dialogue . No doubt this is deliberate on the part of director JC Chandor who has made a film that technically looks like it was made in 1981 . You could imagine this starring Robet DeNiro and Robert Duvall in the last days of the New Hollywood era . It's not brilliant but it's an engaging enough film with a couple of unexpected plot turns",A Most Violent Year
10,LeonLouisRicci,The Camel Hair Coat,5,21 May 2015,"It doesn't Bode Well for a Film when the most Lingering Image is a Camel Hair Coat. Especially one with this Title. But that just might be what Happens after Viewing. Because although the Look of the Movie throughout is softly Muted for an Overcast, NYC in Wintertime 1981 Appearance, it is really Background to the Camel Hair Coat that Walks Through the Story.Speaking of Story, this is one of those that is Big on Story, You Know the Kind, all about the Who, Where, and the Why, and Not so much About the How and the What. We Learn much about this Non-Gangster, who seems to Hang around a Lot of Gangsters. We are Told and Told Again that He is a ""Good Man"" and does Everything Straight and Above Board.So Much so that it gets a bit Tedious and even His Wife is Losing Patience with all the Goody-Goody Posturing. The Gist of all this seems just how much He will take before He Cracks and Fights Back against the ""Real"" Gangsters that are Taking Advantage of this ""Pussy"" (as his wife calls him). That's the Tension.Well Acted, but the Conceit of the Slow-Burn Story Never Manifests itself into an Entertainment that Rises much Above Average.

11,writers_reign,Return of the Cat People,7,23 January 2015,"Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur clearly have a lot to answer for and their influence is for far-reaching than they knew. Back in the day - 70 years ago but who's counting - they collaborated on a modest 'B' picture entitled Curse Of The Cat People in which they racked up the tension but stopped short of actually showing any big cats attacking people. So it is here, gangster warfare constantly on the edge of the frame but never quite breaking through the glass fence. Statistically 1981 was one of if not THE most violent year in the history of New York, and against that backdrop a small heating-oil business is facing pressure on several fronts; at a basic level its trucks are being hi-jacked to the point where drivers are afraid to venture out; fiscally they are under investigation for dodgy bookkeeping and the bank pulls out as guarantor for a 1.5 mil loan they need to expand. The bulk of this is conveyed in dialogue as opposed to action and the writer is served brilliantly by the leading actors not least Jessica Chastain. An excellent drama.",A Most Violent Year

However, the contract to buy the terminal has a very strict timeline and provisions. To add to his worries, his trucks are being hijacked and the District Attorney is about to take him to court on felony charges...Interesting and intriguing drama. Is a slow-burner, but is never dull. However, for all the work that goes into building the intrigue and developing the plot, there are a few scenes which just don't gel and the ending does feel quite flat. There is no great profundity awaiting you at the end of it all. Excellent performance by Oscar Isaac in the lead role. Then again, I don't think he is capable of a bad performance - surely an Academy award cannot be too far away? Good work too by Jessica Chastain as his wife, Albert Brooks as their lawyer and David Oyelowo as the DA.Ultimately, while the plot is reasonably interesting, the performances carry the movie.",A Most Violent Year
13,oscaralbert,"""Little Oil"" is equally as corrupt as ""Big Oil"" . . .",8,26 March 2016,". . . is the main take-away from A MOST VIOLENT YEAR. Even for folks who do not own a copy of BUSH CRIME FAMILY, which explains how Jeb Bush's grandpa--Prescott Bush--made World War Two possible by providing Hitler's Blitzkrieg with a crucial diesel fuel additive in the 1930s, the History of Oil is synonymous with the History of Violence, from 1880 to the Present. THERE WILL BE BLOOD, GIANT, and AMER!CAN SNIPER are just three of countless films documenting mayhem in the oil fields and in the Oil Wars. A MOST VIOLENT YEAR sets itself apart by focusing upon 18 deadly fuel oil truck hijackings, along with sundry kidnappings, beatings, and Acts of Terrorism which occurred around New York City in 1981. Oscar Isaacs plays ""Abel,"" an adherent to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Non-violent Preachings. But Abel's no more able to defend himself against the Little Oil Industry thugs than millions of ordinary Americans have been in combating Big Oil's Fracking (which has brought coast-to-coast earthquakes into formerly quake-free zones, causing untold thousands of cracked home foundations and driveways, not to mention polluted drinking water aquifers).

15,ferguson-6,a Gangster-style non-Gangster movie,8,14 January 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. The tar pits of La Brea. Michael Corleone. These are the two things that come to mind as I grasp for descriptive terms to use for writer/director JC Chandor's latest film. Picture a slow simmer never quite reaching the boiling point  that's the designed tone here. It's certainly not the period piece crime thriller that the trailer might have you poised for. In fact, there is more focus on marital communication than the criminal element so prevalent for the times.In 1981, New York City was in the midst of an era filled with crime, corruption, violence and filth. Enter Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) as a tough-minded, but idealistic owner of a heating oil business. Abel's vision is to become the top oil distributor, and remain a really good guy in the process. When he tells his less-idealistic competitors to ""have some pride in their work"", it's good advice to an audience incapable of comprehending. Despite regular violence and criminal activity against his drivers and trucks, Abel continues to deny he is at war  he truly believes if he can stay above the fracas, he can overcome the blight of his industry.We never really see Abel have a good day. Even the high points are paired with hard knocks. A signed contract is followed by bank woes. A kid's birthday party at the new house is interrupted by a search warrant. New market share is offset by a driver illegally defending himself. Each step Abel takes to realize his business vision is a potential land mine set by either his competitors or an ambitious District Attorney (David Oyelowo). And those aren't even his most animated battles. See, Abel has willed himself to extraordinary self-control. He never blows a gasket, even if the moment calls for it. The only exception to this is with his vicious business partner and wife Anna (Jessica Chastain). Anna grew up the daughter of a gangster  her dad once ran the business that she and Abel now run. Given the times, Anna takes a back seat to Abel and she handles the books, while he is the face of the business with banks, competitors and Teamsters. It's not difficult to imagine a movie focusing on Anna rather than Abel, and a couple of times, she makes it quite clear that she views herself as the real backbone of the business – a much tougher leader than her doe-eyed husband. Isaac and Chastain are exceptional here, and they both pull off very tough roles. Abel is a philosopher is a world of barbarians. He is the most polite angry person you have likely ever seen. Anna, on the other hand, is the pretty face masking a ruthless gangster. They each believe their own way is the best way. When Abel explains that 'The result is known', and that there is only 'one path that is most right', we immediately know he believes this and lives his life accordingly. In addition to Isaac, Chastain and Oyelow, other actors deserve recognition for their work here: Albert Brooks is Abel's consigliore, in a style reminiscent of his Drive character; Alessandro Nivola is the most frightening type of gangster – the quiet, powerful kind; Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace) is outstanding in her only scene; Elyes Gabel captures the frustrated driver looking for hope; Peter Gerety is spot on as the Teamsters lead; and Jerry Adler is a most unusual Jewish business man.The camera work of cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma) helps make the style and story work. He films two of the most unusual chase scenes – one on foot across the highway, and another with a car and truck on railroad tracks and through a dark tunnel. Both are critical to story and character, and provide a stylistic flourish that pumps things up in a movie otherwise devoid of traditional action. The story is captivating because of things that are intimated, rather than things that are said. A couple of other films set in this era are Prince of the City and Serpico, and though the tone and look may be familiar, Chandor's approach is unique. It's not difficult to imagine Oscar Isaac took his acting cues from Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, and oddly enough, it's possible to imagine him as Tony Montana in a Scarface remake! At the core of all of these characters  the American Dream.",A Most Violent Year
16,phd_travel,A most effective movie,10,9 February 2015,"This isn't a very violent film as one might infer from the title but it is still very scary and tense. Less is more proves accurate here so when there is some violence it is even more scary and meaningful than if there were a high body count.It isn't about petty crime and violence in NYC in 1981, it's about a very hardworking Hispanic man Morales (Oscar Isaac) married to a gangster's daughter (Jessica Chastain) trying to expand and grow his heating oil business. He comes up against theft of his vehicles and intimidation of his staff from rivals, a dirty DA, and financing problems.Oscar Isaac gives an earnest believable performance that brings to mind Pacino but this movie is more realistic than the Godfather or Scorsese movies. It's more plausible - no rub outs, that's why it is so scary when you worry with him about his personal safety and that of his family and employees, and even his financing problems. The viewer can feel for him has he tries to remain calm and relatively virtuous through all the problems coming together and all the corruption surrounding him. Jessica Chastain has an 80s Linda Evans hairstyle and shoulder pads. She is convincing as the hard practical girl from a shady family but still a loving supportive wife.This kind of movie should have done better at the box office because it is just so well written. Deserved nominations all round for screenplay, directing, acting and picture, more so than some of this year's nominated movies.

It's 1981, said to be one of New York's most violent years, and, paradoxically, A Most Violent Year doesn't focus on the incredibly violent; it focuses on what happens between all the violence and on the outskirts of all the madness. We follow Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), who runs Standard Oil, a heating oil company that has been plagued by frequent hijackings of the company's utility trucks, resulting in thousands of dollars in lost materials. Abel is a man who tries to have a firm moral compass, believing in the good of people and resisting the temptation to give into complete and total corruption, despite being heavily influenced to do so by his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain).On top of the company losing money with every hijacking, a District Attorney named Lawrence (David Oyelowo) is in the process of investigating Standard Oil's fraudulent activity, such as price fixing and tax evasion. This brings Abel's company and dreams down even more, leading him to seek the purchase of an oil terminal on a river bank with the leader of Jewish Chassidim (Jerry Adler). This purchase would allow for more storage for Abel's company, which will help for when fuel prices lower in the summertime and eventually rise during the winter. He tries to manage this all while minimizing relations with gangsters and attempting not to turn into the person he promised himself he didn't want to become.A Most Violent Year's marketing campaign made it seem as if this film was a hardened gangster epic. The film itself, however, finds ways to work against that stereotype, acting as the contrasting force or the ""anti"" to a great deal of gangster films thanks to the ethics of its character. Abel's character is a fascinating one because never does he fall into the category of being an anti-hero or a traditional hero. He tows the line, and even by the end of the film, we're not totally sure if we're supposed to side with him because we've seen him do equally admirable and contemptible things.The problem with Abel's methods is that while he's willing to play fair, he has found that his business, and the business world in general, calls for grittier, more devious play, which is why we see him in the mess he's in now. Writer/director Chandor explores how man gets sucked into this world whilst trying to function in the business world, almost suggesting that the system encourages and eventually forces such drastic illegalities to take place over time. The idea that large-scale business operations and closed-door corruption exist in unison is by no means a new idea, but Chandor magnifies the idea through an intriguing lens, giving us a character that is trying to function on this dirty playing field and learning this idea the hard way.Abel, at times, acts like Job, if we're going to toy a bit with the name of Abel, presuming it has biblical relevance here. Abel's morality is tested on various occasions, and like Job, in some respects, he tries to stay true to what he believes, but once he recognizes he's in a business that demands risk and self-interest, it's difficult for him to stay on this particular path of righteousness.It only helps that Abel's struggle is humanized and brought to life by a character actor as powerful and talented as Oscar Isaac. Isaac, who completely won me over in the emotionally-affecting Inside Llewyn Davis, through just two acclaimed starring roles, has proved to be an exceptional actor we must keep our eyes on or else he'll slip further under the radar than he has. Isaac's strength comes in the frequent subtleties he infuses in Abel. We often see him trying to bottle all his rage and impulsive emotions up, only allowing his anger to slip in front of people like his wife or his attorney (Albert Brooks) but in a very sporadic manner. Isaac's portrayal of a man grappling with all he can bear is powerful stuff, and it's these ordinary little, true-to-life inclusions that make him explode on screen.He's so good that it makes me wish Chastain was given more of a character here instead of the instigating wife. Her persistent belittling of what she perceives is her husband's passivity makes her character lose any kind of narrative or emotional relevance as we see her just as another variation on the nagging wife cliché. To be fair, however, Isaac commands so much ground here that it's difficult for veterans like Brooks to keep up with him while in the same frame, but Chastain's character and acting abilities are sorely undermined here.A Most Violent Year is like an enormous piece of art on a large, spacious canvas with many colors, patterns, and designs. It's hard to take it all in while it's happening right before your eyes, but once you digest it and see it through, it becomes something you can't take your eyes off and, in turn, appreciate on many different levels.Starring: Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, Albert Brooks, and Jerry Adler.

It's a crime drama of the American way and living the dream as with life you pay a price for money and success especially when it comes from greed, violence and a life of crime. The film centers around immigrants a married couple Abel Morales(Oscar Isaac)and Anna Morales(Jessica Chastain in a direct and straight to the point role!)who run their own family business in a time of decay, violence, and corruption. You name it this mob drama has blood, murder, money, scandal, investigation and drama of moral right and wrong the backbone and delight of the film is Abel's strong direct tough as nails ball busting wife Anna as this lady calls the direction in the family she's not worried about making choices or pulling the trigger. Overall this film is a drama about what it's like to pay the price for greed and power while living the cold hard violent and blood soaked American dream.",A Most Violent Year
21,lasttimeisaw,"A different kind of ""violence"", which is more hazardous for humanity",7,15 May 2015,"If we presumably equates ""violent"" to ""death"", we are destined to be mislead by J.C. Chandor's third feature, A MOST VIOLENT YEAR, as we follow our poker-faced protagonist Abel Morales (Isaac), who has experienced a tough year with his oil company business in NYC 1981, negotiate his way with unscrupulous business competitors, a stalwart district DA Lawrence (Oyelowo), we assume in any certain moment he would start a killing spree in the Godfather style. This never happens, since the dogma of Abel's action is that he will never do anything to jeopardise his business, which means he will never act like a gangster, he is not a felon (as he tells Lawrence in the coda), although Chandor manifestly imbues his crime-tale with a solemn layout and vintage colour pattern under the heavy influence of Francis Ford Coppola's gangster school, not to mention Isaac is obviously channelling Al Pacino's Michael Corleone but in a no-violence policy. Abel is an ambitious, principled man, and quoted by his wife Anna (Chastain), he has never let his ego go in the way of his business decisions, the 2-hour film patiently recounts the entire process of how he manage to collect enough money to buy a property which will profitably expand his trade, with many hurdles in between. The most ruinous one is the fact that his oil trucks have been continuously mugged by two unknown criminals, which massively hurts the morale among his truck drivers, and due to Abel's refusal of equipping them with arms for protection (for fear that the action will drag himself into lawsuits), one young driver Julian (Gabel), who has being attacked once, gets an unlicensed gun and with bad luck, the same thing happens again, and this time he shoots for self-defence, but flees the scene and hides away. Meanwhile, Abel's company is under investigation by Lawrence, and soon the bank will rescind their loan due to all the investigations inflicted on the company, so Abel only has several days to find 1.5 million dollars to finish his deal of the expansion. So one key question here is whether Abel sticks to perform is a completely legitimate enterprise or there is a discount of the term ""legitimate"", which means as long as it cannot be traced back to him and his company, he can condone it, as the economic crimes Anna commits during all the years. In the end, Abel chooses the latter, he starts as a hero audience is rooting for, but in the final confrontation with Julian, his moral backbone crumbles and his true colour unveils. Chandor leerily argues that a moral decadence is de rigueur for a big player like Abel, for whom a promising political career in the offing.Oscar Isaac shines through with astonishing gravitas to portray such a complex character, unassuming but transfixing to behold, one of the best among his peers for a less showier flair. Jessica Chastain, handles the dramatic face-off with her consistently strong presence to indicate she is not merely a trophy blonde, but the script doesn't leave her enough substantially show-stopping fodder to capitalise on. After all, the film is made by dab hands of craftsmanship, sometimes, it borders on tedium, but I have a bone to pick with the script, the subplot of Julian is quite baffling to comprehend (his side of story never being fully elucidated before his final wretchedness), his tragedy as an expendable pawn never achieves its pathos one might expect, and there are also some loose ends such as who is behind the assault of the poor sales guy (Rosenfield) just in the doorstep of his clients' house and who is the burglar left a gun in Abel's house in the night?",A Most Violent Year
22,Hellmant,Much better than Chandor's previous two film efforts!,9,30 January 2015,"'A MOST VIOLENT YEAR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed crime drama flick, written and directed by J.C. Chandor (who also performed both duties on 2011's 'MARGIN CALL' and 2013's 'ALL IS LOST'). The film is set in New York City, in 1981; which was (statistically speaking) one of the most violent years in the city's history. It revolves around an immigrant, desperately trying to expand his business. The movie stars Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo (of recent 'SELMA' and 'INTERSTELLAR' fame), Iyes Gabel, Alessandro Nivola and Albert Brooks. It's a somewhat long and slow paced film but it's also extremely well made and fittingly stylistic; much better than Chandor's previous two film efforts.Isaac plays Abel Morales; an immigrant running a successful heating oil distribution company, in 1981 New York City. He wants to broaden his business, even further, but the dangerous crime, of the times, threatens to get in his way. Chastain plays Abel's wife, and business partner, Anna. Brooks plays Abel's attorney, Andrew Walsh. Oyelowo plays a man investigating Abel's company, for suspected foul play, named Lawrence. Gabel plays a truck driver, working for Morales, who is most victimized by the violent crime effecting the business. Nivola plays a small part, as well, as a rival heating oil distributor.I was not a fan of Chandor's first two feature films; I found them to be ambitious, and somewhat well made, but ultimately very boring. This movie is slow, and dull at times, too; but it's also much more fascinating and involving (even suspenseful at times). I love all of the performances in it (especially Isaac's) and my favorite part of the movie is it's score (by Alex Ebert); which heavily uses synthesizers and is also very reminiscent of other crime films, from the early 80s, too. The film itself is also nostalgic and extremely faithful to the style, and mood, of classic 70s and 80s crime flicks as well. It's definitely a well made and memorable film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/fbw9P594Crc",A Most Violent Year

24,paul2001sw-1,A most perfect businessman,7,11 January 2017,"Viewers who watched J.C. Chandor's thoughtful 'Margin Call', about the 2008 financial crisis, will see some of the same strengths in 'A Most Violent Year', whose subject is the efforts of a businessman to stay afloat in the winter of 1981. But the setup here is not entirely satisfactory: the hero is good looking, has made enough money to be able to take ""I like to own what I use"" as a guiding principle, is the last honest man in New York, and even briefly turns action hero to track down those who are stealing from him. Even the basic premise of the plot is a little contrived: to win a deal, he offers terms which leave him exposed to all of the risk (and needless to say, some of that risk duly materialises). The film hints at the possibility that he might not be as straight as he professes (or even believes); but ultimately, shies away from this position. Instead, the film asks us to respect a man whose goal is to drive his rivals out of business, because he plans to do so through his own innate excellence. We do see hints of his single-mindedness that are unappealing; but the film refrains from passing harsh judgement. The perfection of the character somewhat undermined my interest in what is basically a very well-constructed film.",A Most Violent Year
25,MOscarbradley,Seek this out; it's superb,9,5 February 2015,"With only his third film J.C. Chandor has taken on the mantle of Sidney Lumet and has done him proud. ""A Most Violent Year"" is an incredibly tense, gripping drama, (I hesitate to call it a thriller per se), set in New York in 1981, reputedly the most violent year in the city's history and around the time Lumet was making films like ""Prince of the City"" and ""The Verdict"". Like these, ""A Most Violent Year"" depends, not on action, extreme violence or sex but on a good story, a brilliant script, intelligent direction and a host of superb performances.Oscar Isaac, (getting better with every film), is Abel Morales, owner of his own oil company and in the throes of a deal that will greatly expand his empire, who finds he is also the subject of a number of hi-jackings of this trucks, possibly organized by his competitors. Abel is a good, decent man who doesn't want to dirty his hands even though both he and his company are being investigated by District Attorney David Oyelowo. His wife, on the other hand, isn't so squeamish, whether it's in fiddling the books or shooting an injured deer. She's played, terrifically, by Jessica Chastain in an Oscar-worthy performance, (she didn't even manage a nomination), and her presence on screen suggests this film may go down some very dark streets indeed.Of course, if Chandor keeps making films like this he isn't going to wow the Academy, (though he did wow the National Board of Review who chose it as the years best picture), or bring in the big bucks not because ""A Most Violent Year"" is below par, (it isn't; it's easily one of the best pictures of last year), but because he makes the kind of intelligent pictures about subjects other directors tend to shy away from, (the financial fall-out in ""Margin Call""; a one-man show and set in the middle of the Ocean in ""All is Lost""). He's also proved himself a great director of actors and a writer of uncommon intelligence. The fact that this film failed to pick up a single Oscar nomination speaks volumes about the Academy's tunnel-vision. Seek it out, it's superb.",A Most Violent Year
26,ThomasDrufke,What Path Will You Take?,6,26 June 2015,"There are some films that have great trailers and end up with a disappointing result, and then there are some films with god awful trailers that end up surprising us, unfortunately A Most Violent Year is the former. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. But there was great promise here. The trailers spoke to the 'greatest crime year in New York' vibe and I thought it may be a more grounded version of Goodfellas. Unfortunately, the film ends up being a slow burn story about a hard working oil businessman who ends up getting tangled in a serious of crimes against his own business.The problem is, the crimes aren't really anywhere to be found. Most of them occur off screen and lack the tension building that a film like this needs. J.C. Chandor is a great director who turned a very boring story on paper, Margin Call, into an unbelievably tension filled drama. But this film is centered around crime that ends up being a tad too slow to make it memorable. I will say the performances alone are worth seeing. Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain are two of the best actors working today and they do well playing off of each other. It was also fun seeing Chastain back in the powerful female lead much like her role in Zero Dark Thirty. She ends up doing most of the hard work for the business, or more like the off the books dirty work. But Isaac is also great at acting with his eyes. There aren't many actors who can say paragraphs of dialogue just by using their eyes in a certain way. As much as I loved the two's dynamic, I wish the film would have been even more focused on them than the excessive amount of conversations he has with other businessman. It just seemed like the film's focus should have been elsewhere.Back to the New York setting, the film is gorgeous and does paint a picture of what NY probably looked like at that time, it's just unfortunate that the crime element of the film was lacking. Chandor nailed the Margin Call script, but here it seems he didn't know exactly what the film was supposed to be. I didn't feel any sense of worth. In other words, I wasn't exactly sure what the film was trying to say to the audience. But I loved the performances and the film looks beautiful. And at times, in terms of character drama, the film can be intense. I just wish the entire film was filled with that same sense of dramatic tension that Margin Call brought to the table.+Looks gorgeous +Lead performances are magnetic +Intense when it wants to be..-..But it lacked tension when the film called for it -Nothing too special 6.7/10",A Most Violent Year

I thought it was going to have a mafia feel to it and I sat down excited about it. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The movie itself wasn't bad, it was very well made and the acting was great. The problem was that it was very slow moving and a little tough to get into. Isaac was a great choice for this role, but Chastain really steals the movie. She is ruthless and very scary but very under used. I really think the movie would have been helped had she been in it more. Again though, this is really not a bad movie, I think my expectations were just a little too high and it didn't live up to them. Overall, very well done and great acting but I was still disappointed.

30,sol-,Trying to live the American Dream,7,27 December 2015,"Amid soaring crime rates and with thousands of dollars of fuel stolen from his company, an immigrant oil distributor gradually discovers that it is impossible ""not to be a gangster"" if he wants to realise his American Dream in this crime drama set in 1980s New York. Very deliberately paced and with precious little violence actually shown on screen, 'A Most Violent Year' is hardly a gangster film in the traditional sense and the film understandably opened to mixed reviews. Patience is rewarded if one sticks with the film though, and while the deliberate pacing is initially off-putting, it coincides in well with the protagonist's very gradual discovery of just how corrupt and crooked the world around him actually is. Oscar Isaac is compelling as the immigrant oil distributor in question, but even better are Albert Brooks as his attorney, who knows more than what he lets on, and Jessica Chastain as his wife, who he slowly discovers has more of her crime boss father in her blood than he ever realised. A pivotal deer scene involving Chastain comes off as a melodramatic though; same can be said for the fate of Elyes Gabel's character and other bits and the pieces. The mystery of who exactly is ""ripping"" Isaac off works quite well though in that the answer is never as important as what the act itself has on Isaac's perception of the world around him. Never has the American Dream seemed harder to achieve and David Oyelowo offers a strong performance as the city's district attorney, unwilling to help Isaac with his problems since he is also investigating his company.",A Most Violent Year
31,tomgillespie2002,Falters at the climax when the build-up suggests something special,6,21 April 2015,"Set in New York during 1981, the year in which the city recorded its highest crime rate, A Most Violent Year evokes the American cinema of the 1970's - brutally unsentimental and strictly character- driven. There are no sweeping shots of Times Square or children playing in water squirting from a busted fire hydrant; this is snowy and industrial, and slower and more thoughtful than it's rather shoddy title suggests. It's also bolstered by some impressive performances, with lead Oscar Isaac continuing his recent star- making yet modest run of late, again proving that he is Lon Chaney's natural successor to the 'man of a thousand faces' tag with another chameleon-esque performance.Yet the slow pace and brooding intensity doesn't quite deliver towards the end, offering a predictable and easy resolution compared to the memorable finale I was expecting. Isaac plays immigrant Abel Morales, who is Abel in both name and execution, riding high on the top of a newly-built oil company while his murky competitors snarl at his success. With corruption infesting the entire city from every corner, Assistant District Attorney Lawrence (David Oyelowo) is breathing down his neck, only Abel is trying his best to keep on the straight and narrow. The father of his wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), belonged to a different generation, one that succeeded through violence and intimidation, exactly the kind of reputation Abel is trying to shake.In a bit to surpass his competitors, Abel and his lawyer Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks) strike a deal with a group of Jewish Hasidim to purchase land that will allow him to ship in his product directly from the dock. He is given a week to honour the contract and pay a hefty sum, and the land is his. Only his competitors have different ideas, and Abel suspects one, or all, of them are behind the recent truck hijackings that have left his drivers, namely fellow immigrant Julian (Elyes Gabel), shook up. The union are soon on his back to arm his employees so they may have a better chance at defending themselves, but Abel wants no blood on his hands. With pressure coming from the D.A., his rivals, the Teamsters and his wife, Abel must survive the week before his empire crumbles.With its dialogue-heavy meetings in barber shops and warehouses and the sight of Isaac in a huge camel-hair coat, comparisons to classics gangster films, notably The Godfather (1972), are obvious. But this is a study of business, and the film comes alive with a hushed conversation more than it does with its sporadic bursts of violence. Technically, it's tightly-controlled and immaculate, with director J.C. Chandor wisely choosing not to score the film with 80's synth and give everyone a mullet, but instead preferring a more lived-in feel. However, too often does the story seem unbelievable and contradictory for such a polished film, faltering at the pay-off when the build-up suggested something special. If I gave half-stars in my review ratings then this would certainly earn itself one, but it will have to settle for 3 out of 5 for now.",A Most Violent Year
32,eddie_baggins,"Another great film from Chandor, one of the years best",9,5 July 2015,"With his debut in 2011 with the brilliant dramatization of the early beginnings of the GFC in the Oscar nominated Margin Call, his follow up with the brave and well liked All is Lost and now with the critically acclaimed and somewhat forgotten about third feature A Most Violent Year, filmmaker J.C. Chandor is very quickly becoming one of the industry's brightest young talents and a model of consistency.Quite possibly the least gangster gangster film ever made, A Most Violent Year sees Chandor enhance his directional abilities to all new levels and where Margin Call saw him master the art of the script and his actors and All is Lost the art of storytelling almost entirely through visuals, A Most Violent Year sees a combination of highly impressive elements combine to create one of the year's most fully formed and competent films.A Most Violent Year is one of the those films that's so finely constructed, you'd be hard pressed to find a single weak component, right down to the way in which violence doesn't drive the film as the title may suggest, merely plays out in its background as a master puppeteer, as heard frequently in the radio chatter our characters listen to. Chandor's direction and screen writing is the work of someone assured of their material and displays a finesse not normally seen in a filmmaker so young into his career which combines perfectly with the behind the camera work of increasingly impressive D.O.P Bradford Young (going along with fine work on Ain't Them Body Saints and Selma) and the moody musical score from Edward Sharpe front man Alex Ebert suggests that he and Chandor could just become perfect artistic collaborators after this and All is Lost.With all this artistic merit on display, at the heart of Chandor's tale lies an incredibly intriguing and undoubtedly slow burning story of people trying to ""take the most right option"" in their quest to achieve their goals. Front and centre to this journey is Oscar Isaac's driven business owner Abel Morales, one of the most layered characters of recent memories that allows Isaac to deliver another hugely energetic turn in what's quickly becoming one of the most interesting acting journeys in the last few years. Isaac's interplay with all involved here is incredible and with Jessica Chastain's feisty turn as Abel's not easy to read wife Anna, A Most Violent Year will keep those viewers that are willing to enjoy the slowly rising tensions on offer, glued to their seats with anticipation.There are some very slight narrative missteps that stop A Most Violent Year from becoming a near perfect example of both a morality tale, a tale of ambition and a dramatic thriller of the highest calibre but as it stands Chandor's film is one of the year's most impressive all round productions that plays out against the backdrop of an intriguing, violence infested, true to life time in the history of New York City, where men and women like Abel and Anna battled daily for their survival both metaphorically and figuratively.4 and a half unhelpful dogs out of 5",A Most Violent Year
33,leonblackwood,Complex drama! 6/10,6,24 May 2015,"Review: This is another movie which is completely different to the advert and the poster! I thought that it was going to be a New York gangster movie set in the 80's but it turned out to be about a sincere business man who wants to push his freight business into the mainstream, with the law and the mob on his back. After a few of his trucks get stolen and the law opens a case against him, he struggles to prove that his business is legit whilst trying to find out who is stealing his trucks. On top of that, the bank pull out of an important deal between him and some Jewish land owners so he has to find the money to close the deal or he will lose his down payment, which was all of his life savings. With all of these elements happening at the same time, it's a very intense drama were you don't know who is good or who is bad. The innocent business/family man is against violence and dirty money so he tries his utmost to keep the business legit, against all odds. The performances from the cast, is top class but it does take some time to get going. The pace of the movie is quite slow but the intensity kept the movie interesting along with the many twist and turns in the storyline. I was impressed with the determination and ability not to break under pressure from the main character and you can't help rooting for him, to achieve his goals. Although the movie isn't a true story, it does feel very realistic which is due to good writing and a great cast. In all, it's a complex drama which is quite enjoyable, if your in the right frame of mind. Enjoyable!Round-Up: It's a shame that this movie tanked at the box office because the cast gave it there all and the storyline isn't that bad. If there were some big names in the film, it might have got the money that it deserved but it really didn't go down well with audiences. Oscar Isaac was a great choice for the lead and his sharp, business mannerisms worked well with this character. There were many parts of the film were he could have broken down and turn to the dark side but he's extremely focused on his goals which is very inspiring. Jessica Chastain, who put Oscar forward for his role, is great in the movie and her complete trust in her husband was very realistic. She has recently starred in Interstellar and she played the bitch in Help, which I'm sure everyone will remember because of the cake with the extraordinary ingredients. Anyway, I must have enjoyed this film because I stayed awake all the way through the movie, so you know that it's worth a watch.Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their intense dramas about a businessman who wants to push his freight business into the mainstream whilst being under investigation of fraud and fighting against the mob. 6/10",A Most Violent Year
34,howard.schumann,Does not quite live up to its potential,8,24 February 2015,"Written and directed by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All is Lost), A Most Violent Year has a different take on the American dream. While it does not question the fact that the poor can rise to the top by virtue of their own hard work and perseverance, Chandor lets us know that they can also be helped by illegal or unethical business practices. Set in 1981 in New York City, a record year for rapes and murders, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), a recent immigrant who started as a truck driver, strives to hold fast to his ideals but is forced by reason of necessity to compromise them. Morales is a tough competitor in the heating oil business in New York City but is looking to cement his position and rise even farther by purchasing a riverfront oil-holding facility from Hasidic Jews.Threats to his position, however, arise from unknown rivals who attack his door-to-door sales people and zero in on one of his drivers, Julian (Elyes Gabel), while siphoning oil from his tankers. They even go so far as to send a gunman to stalk his home and leave a loaded gun for Abel's young daughter to play with. Morales desperately wants to avoid a turf war but is challenged to act more decisively by his tough-minded wife Anna (Jessica Chastain), whose mafia-connected father originally sold him the business. To show she means business, after Abel hits a deer on the highway and is queasy about finishing him off, Anna makes sure that the deer is put out of its misery.Anna's tough stand has support from Andrew Walsh (David Brooks), Morales' lawyer, who wants to arm the drivers over Morales' objections. Complicating matters even further, an ambitious prosecutor in the DA's office (David Oyelowo) is preparing an indictment against the company on unspecified charges of fraud, though Morales insists everything he has done has complied with industry standards. Whether or not the charges are legitimate is never made clear. When Morales' driver Julian takes it upon himself to carry a gun and engages in a shootout with the hijackers on the 59th Street Bridge, the banks become leery and pull out of the loan agreement leaving Morales with only two days to raise the money to complete the real estate deal.A Most Violent Year has captured the gritty realism of big-city life and the performances are uniformly terrific, especially Isaac, with his clean-cut, deep thinking, but don't trust me look. He is a character cut in the cloth of Michael Corleone, but sadly one whose ruthlessness he ends up emulating. One of Isaac's most impressive scenes is his attempt to coach new salesman in the specific methods they need to close a deal. ""Hold their attention longer than you should,"" he suggests. ""If they offer tea or coffee, ask for tea because we have to look like the best."" Chastain does her usual good work but her character is so changeable from one scene to the next, that it is hard to figure out whether her relationship with Abel is a business deal or whether there is actually some affection involved.While the film builds an undercurrent of tension that keeps us paying attention, something seems to be missing. It may be perhaps that none of the characters demonstrate much growth or are particularly likable. Except for the shootout and a chase through New York subway tunnels with Morales in a suit and a camel-hair coat, there is little to engage the senses. While A Most Violent Year maintains its brooding solemnity throughout, it never really comes to grips with what it wants to be. Is it a crime drama, a character study of immigrants, a primer on big-city corruption, an attack on American capitalism, a philosophical treatise on business ethics? Perhaps it is a little bit of all of the above but, in spite of some gripping moments, it does not quite live up to its potential to excel in any of them.",A Most Violent Year
35,Ed-Shullivan,A Most Forgettable and Overrated Film,4,6 July 2019,"The premise of a young up and coming man with ambition making it in the fuel industry with his beautiful wife and two (2) children after just moving into their dream home and in a tony neighborhood is turned upside down rather quickly in the cut throat business he has chosen.I always enjoy the retro scenery of the past decades (the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and even the 80's) and A Most Violent Year did a good job in maintaining the scenery of that 80's era, especially with the vehicles. What I didn't enjoy though was the storyline and the over played ethnic roles of the players in the fuel industry.The story was slow and yet predicable, lacking any level of suspense and/or characters that you could either love or hate. No memorable performances to speak of either.I give this film a paltry 4 out of 10 rating.",A Most Violent Year

There were a couple of reasons for this.Whilst they did an ok job of setting the scene of the early 80's I think Scorsese is the master of this and would have created a more immersive vision of the era.Secondly an injection of violence to up the ante of the drama already created. It didn't need to go down the path of Goodfellas but using a few elements of that movie in AMVY would have enhanced the film.Still...good movie.",A Most Violent Year
37,matthewssilverhammer,Methodic Thriller,7,14 February 2015,"Chandor (All is Lost) is one of the more prolific young directors working. With AMVY, an adult mystery-drama-thriller, he screams of the classics: tension of French Connection, quiet of Chinatown, and menace of Mean Streets. It's a fantastic period piece that creates an authentic, distinct look at 1980s New York, while tonally replicating films from that era. Is it a bit TOO quiet and a bit TOO slow at times? Yepbut the taut skill on display is too good to ignore. Abel Morales, a successful, hardworking oil company owner, tries to thrive and survive during 1981 NYC, the most violent year in history. Despite this premise, the crime-action is more a successfully imminent background thought than a constant in-your- face presence. As the movie progresses and ultimately gets better, the subtle suspense builds, and each individual incident pushes Morales closer to his breaking point. Isaac shines in the protagonist role, playing one of the coolest characters around: broken yet proud, strong yet vulnerable, decent yet pressed, and shrewdly bad-to-the-bone. I wish Chastain was a bit more up to the task as his ominous, hardly-doting wife, but luckily she's not a huge distraction to the otherwise stellar acting by some of Hollywood's great new talents. Throughout the solid work being done, we are presented with some great things to ponder: wanting the American dream without knowing why; struggling to be successful without becoming corrupt; juggling humility and pride in a world that drains you. Unfortunately the character's relationships with these different questions bring the movie to a bore at times. Mostly though, it manages to be a solid little award-season drama.",A Most Violent Year

Words are failing when images are so powerful as in ""A Most Violent Year""... Seen it 5 times already since it's release and it is here to stay. Gets better with every viewing...It is not a big drama or thriller, it is the story of the struggle to build up an business empire, depicting the thin line between achieving succes and becoming complicit in violence. Oscar Isaac plays an upcoming oil distributor in New York back in the eighties, at a time when crime was running wild in the big apple. Married to a mob's daugther he still wants to walk the righteous path without using his wife's mob connections to make a succes of his oilbusiness. Will he succeed in being a honest businessman or will he cave in under pressure and use the mob to build up his new oil company?This movie became a classic at the very moment it was released. You just gotta see it to believe it. It is not the story that is monumental, the acting is though. The very best of Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain and Albert Brooks. The way this tale of succes and deceit is photographed and scored deserves nothing but praise. Eye and ear candy! The direction by J.C. Chandor builds up a tension that absorbs every second of film. Few directors are capable of creating such delicate, intense, contineous suspense. J.C Chandor's masterpiece.",A Most Violent Year
40,Turfseer,Chandor's take on corrupt early 80s NYC home oil heating business is standard melodrama,5,16 November 2014,"At a recent Q&A in New York City, J.C. Chandor stated that the ""structure"" of his new film, 'A Most Violent Year,' was one of 'melodrama'. I wanted to stand up and shout: ""why don't you just come out and say it? It IS a melodrama!"" Perhaps deep in Mr. Chandor's unconscious there is a notion that 'melodrama' is usually a poor man's 'tragedy'. It's a rare occasion indeed when the melodramatist is able to lift his narrative to a higher level (we can see that for example, perhaps in one of Arthur Miller's more worthy efforts: 'The Crucible' for example). Unfortunately, as in the case of most 'average' melodramas, the historical world the characters inhabit, is sketchy indeed!I imagine that Mr. Chandor did a modicum of research when he created his protagonist, Abel Morales, the beleaguered owner of a home heating oil distribution business. The film could have been about any blue collar business involving transportation vehicles: sanitation, interstate trucking, moving companies, etc.—take your pick. Part of the strategy here is to avoid doing another organized crime film. Chandor intentionally wants to convey an atmosphere of violence without mentioning anyone directly. So the upshot is that the protagonist, Morales, never finds out exactly who is hijacking his trucks. What's lost here of course is that we never get a real sense of who the antagonist (or antagonists) are. Yes, there's a plethora of 'shady characters' (starting out with a Hasidic family who wants to sell Morales a parcel of land, that he MUST have, if he is to realize his dream of becoming the head honcho in the home heating oil business). But there's nothing really very INTERESTING about these characters. The Sopranos were populated with all kinds of neat characters with idiosyncrasies—Mr. Chandor gives us the basics: the bad guys have engaged in a series of back room price-fixing deals.Chandor must fall back on focusing on his protagonist, Morales, played by Oscar Issac, who reminds one of a grim-faced Al Pacino. Morales is supposed to be 'complicated' as he keeps insisting that he has operated honorably since starting his business. He even insists that his drivers not carry any weapons to protect themselves, because if any of them were to be caught, it would ruin the business' reputation and prevent him from obtaining the bank loan that he desperately needs. In true mythological fashion, Morales has his 'Achilles heel'. That of course is his insatiable desire to win at any cost. Unlike Gordon Gekko, where 'greed is good', Morales believes he's playing by the rules. Yes of course there are ruthless, crooked businessmen who insist they've done nothing wrong, but like O.J. Simpson, it's more than likely that most of these people, deep down, know that they're guilty. But Chandor depicts Morales as being a true innocent. It's his hard-edged wife, Anna, following in the footsteps of her crooked father, who has cooked the books!I personally didn't buy Chandor's notion of a ruthless businessman who is some of kind of saint. Nonetheless, Chandor's stab at tragedy is when he has Morales betray his own high values in order to make the compromises that lead him to obtaining the parcel of land necessary to expand his 'empire'. This occurs in high melodramatic fashion. Julien, one of Morales' poor immigrant drivers who has his rig hijacked at the beginning of the film, ends up arming himself against his boss' wishes and then illegally fires the weapon, to defend himself during a second hijacking attempt. Morales throws Julien 'under the bus' by giving him up to the police. After making a ridiculously unbelievable escape at the moment he turns himself into the police, Julien later kills himself in front of Anna, Morales and his lawyer. Julien is hardly a character we really get to know. He's merely a victim of circumstances and his suicide is Chandor's rather cheap way of invoking tragedy.Chandor also seeks to show that Morales must make other compromises to obtain his goal. First he borrows money from his competitors at exorbitant interest rates in order to purchase the land parcel after the bank turns him down for the loan (the bad publicity from the Julian shootout on the bridge, is the last straw). So Chandor wants you to know that Morales' 'victory' is a Pyrrhic one indeed. But you really have to suspend your disbelief when the local District Attorney (played by David Oyelowo in a throw away role) throws away his decade old investigation and gives Morales a pass. It seems the once incorruptible DA suddenly decides to play ball with the corrupt home heating oil business to satisfy his need to run for governor. How convenient Mr. Chandor!!!Like the Julian suicide, Chandor sprinkles other melodramatic moments throughout the film in place of real character development. Case in point: Anna's decision to kill the deer after fatally striking it with the family car. This of course to illustrate that Anna is way more ruthless than her nice guy husband. While the melodramatic moments might not always be completely believable, I suppose you still need them to move your plot along. Nonetheless, Mr. Chandor occasionally proffers up scenes that don't seem to work at all. Another case in point: the DA allows Anna's birthday party to go on five minutes more, so she and Abel, can hide the financial records underneath the house. Again, quite convenient Mr. Chandor, that the DA and the police are so 'understanding'. But really, even if that was the case, don't you think they might have looked underneath the house anyway?Mr. Chandor still manages to show off his cinematic chops when he stages an exciting chase involving Morales' car and one of his hijacked trucks. Look for the nice twist when we learn it was not one of the big companies doing the hijacking.'Violence' is watchable but pretty much is standard melodrama.",A Most Violent Year
41,BeneCumb,"If husband is the head of the family, then wife is the neck...",7,8 March 2015,"Before zero tolerance policy promotes by the Mayor Guliani in the 1990ies, New York seemed to a be really nasty place - as we can follow in the movie in question, where robberies, desolated industrial areas, shootings, pointless graffiti, etc. set the tone for the background people had to deal with. And the activities to find another way, to cope and thrive without violence and malpractice, seemed almost an impossible task - as we can see via the Morales family, decently performed by Oscar Isaac (as Abel) and Jessica Chastain as Anna; the latter was the practical mastermind, while Abel aimed at communication, explanation and dissuasion... So, the main topic was than one can achieve success by combining them only? Plus some other wise ideas, but all this was depicted in a protracted manner at times, the thrill lost flesh, and many obvious scenes became recurrent, paving the way for predictable ending (a small twist there did not provide any additional value).All in all, not a bad movie, but as for movies dealing with similar topic or period, there are dozens that are more versatile, more catchy, like Carlito's Way or Chinatown.",A Most Violent Year
42,dfranzen70,"When I was 11, it was a very violent year...",8,2 February 2015,"In 1981, an immigrant oilman struggles to improve his fortune and protect his family during the most dangerous year in New York City's history. A Most Violent Year is a strong, character-driven drama that's lifted infinitely by terrific lead performances by Oscar Isaacs and Jessica Chastain, inflating what could have been a tiresome, trite look at one man versus the world in an unkind city.Abel Morales (Isaac) runs Standard Oil, and he has his eyes on some prime waterfront real estate. With this land, he'll be able to fill his trucks from directly from the oil barges on the river, rather than have the oil transported from boat to someone else's trucks and then to his warehouses. And by saving money there, he'll be able to buy a little more oil than he normally would, keep it on the premises, and then sell it to customers or competitors when demand rises. He makes a deal for the land with a sizable down payment and the stipulation that the balance be tendered within 30 days - no extensions allowed. This, of course, is before Abel's company comes under investigation by an intrepid detective (David Oyelowo), his trucks get highjacked and the oil stolen, and his backers start to, well, back away.But Abel is no wilting flower, whether he's dealing with the fuzz or the other oilmen in the city. He has his convictions, and damned if he's going to give them up to appease anyone. Which, as you might suspect, makes things a little more difficult. His wife Anna (Chastain), who can match Abel in sheer willpower, is also fiercely protective of her husband, her business (she's the bookkeeper), and her family. Sort of a two-pronged attack. Abel's charm and style nets him both friends and enemies, but this isn't yet another mobster movie by any means. In fact, the only direct evidence of organized crime in the movie centers around Abel's competition - men who would do anything to maintain and/or increase their share of the lucrative oil business in the city.Both Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Chastain (Interstellar) deliver powerful performances that manage to be both relatable and fascinating. Theirs is not a one-sided relationship. Abel is not some power-mad, bombastic husband who treats the wife and kids as either baggage or items to be used for fun and profit. Anna is not some melodramatic, over-spirited harpy who resents her husband's work obsession. They work together even when they disagree. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention an almost unrecognizable Albert Brooks, the company's astute and slightly amoral lawyer. Brooks, in what appears to be a Karl Malden wig, is a real treat.A Most Violent Year carries a strong message, and that message is this: don't count the little guy out, particularly when he (and his spouse) is whip-smart, unafraid to take chances, and endlessly resourceful. High praise indeed for director J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost) and his talented cast.",A Most Violent Year
43,meeza,Isaaaaaac serves it up!!!,8,7 July 2015,"Writer-Director J.C. Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year"" is not the most violent picture I have ever seen; in fact, there is not that much violence in it. But that is irrelevant, because Chandor's picture is not much about violence, but on entrepreneur competitive tactics to supersede competitors; even though some of the players involved here do bring violence in the mix. The industry that is showcased here is the oil truck corporation. The year here is 1981 and the city, none other than New York, who in that year there was a myriad of violent acts happening in the Big Apple. Rising Star Oscar Isaac stars as Abel Morales, a oil truck company entrepreneur who is in the process of finalizing a slick deal which will bring his company to the top of the game in the New York Oil Truck market. The problem is that Abel's drivers are being thrown and assaulted in their trucks by a competitor or some other entity. Jessica Chastain co-stars as Anna Morales, Abel's wife who is pretty much the boss of that relationship, and she is the mother f*cker who runs that place. Chandor does drive ""A Most Violent Year"" in slow mode, but somehow it was the proper gear to propel this story. His screenplay was solid but not even close as one of the best in ""a most competitive year"" of terrific screenplays in the film year of 2014. However, it was Issac's money starring performance as Abel was what most paramount of ""A Most Violent Year""; no doubt the Morales character will remind you of kinder Michael Corleone, but with the same firepower of topping his competitors. Chastain was sound, but a bit underused; and that is never a good thing when we are talking about one of the greatest, if not the greatest, actress working today. I also enjoyed Albert Brooks' showy work as the Morales' lawyer Andrew Walsh; a role that Chandor probably wrote for Brooks' to drive it home; which he did. ""A Most Violent Year"" is not for everyone, some will find it too slow, but in the end you should set a date with it. **** Good",A Most Violent Year
44,estebangonzalez10,JC Chandor delivers yet another compelling film,8,3 February 2015,"""When it feels scary to jump, that is exactly when you jump, otherwise you end up staying in the same place your whole life, and that I can't do.""Over the past three years director J.C. Chandor has delivered three solid films which in my opinion have been overlooked by mainstream audiences. In Margin Call I was surprised with how well Chandor had written the screenplay for his financial thriller with very fast paced dialogues. Then in his next project (All is Lost), Chandor directed a film with hardly any dialogue whatsoever and managed to keep me engaged with Robert Redford's quiet performance as he struggled to survive at sea. And now in Chandor's recent film, A Most Violent Year, he also delivers a unique crime drama which resembles other classic films like Chinatown and The Godfather trilogy. Chandor has now crafted three great films that are all very different from each other. Despite admiring Chandor for his great screenplays, my favorite film of his is All is Lost which didn't really require any dialogue, so he doesn't necessarily rely on that strength of his. A Most Violent Year stands out thanks to some fantastic performances from a talented cast, some beautiful grayish camera work from Bradford Young (Selma and Ain't Them Bodies Saints), a great production design which recreates New York City in the early 80's in a very realistic way, and of course a strong and gritty screenplay written by Chandor. This is a very slow paced film which delivers on the dynamics between each character more than on traditional action scenes. What stands out the most in A Most Violent Year is the atmosphere that Chandor is able to recreate. Sometimes it feels like not much is going on, but the way the characters interact with one another keeps us engaged and interested. The film focuses on Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) an immigrant and uprising owner of a private oil company who is trying to close a deal on an important property which would boost his business. It seems that his competitors aren't very happy with his rise. The world of private oil companies is dominated by gangsters, but Abel wants to accomplish the American dream legally. Unfortunately his trucks are being hijacked and he's losing thousands of dollars in the process. He is desperately trying to figure out which of his competitors is behind these actions, but Lawrence (David Oyelowo), the officer in charge, doesn't seem to have a clue. He is more interested in opening a file against Abel's company on federal charges for tax evasion. Abel tries his best to remain an honest man, but his wife Anna (Jessica Chasten), whose father is a mobster, will do what it takes to protect her family if Abel doesn't take care of things. All these things threaten Abel's determination to remain legit and find a way to stay afloat, but he is determined to do so. Albert Brooks plays his lawyer, Andrew Walsh.The performance from Oscar Isaacs stood out for me. He reminded me of Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone with is calmed and determined demeanor. Things go very wrong for him, but Abel tries to remain calm and confident trying to gain back control of things. Jessica Chastain is fantastic as his wife. There is a scene where she finds her daughter playing with a gun and her reaction was priceless. The strongest moments of the film are when these two characters interact with each other. She also has a great scene with David Oyelowo where she threatens him to leave her family alone. She may be married to an honest man, but her father's blood runs through her veins. Albert Brooks was fascinating as well despite not being on screen very much. I enjoyed his scenes and his presence is sort of the balancing point for Abel who sometimes wants to do things too legit. The grey tone of the film builds the atmosphere of the story and maintains us engaged despite the slow pacing. There is a fantastic chase scene that takes place two thirds into the film that worked really well and moved the story along, but it was the small interactions between Abel and his wife, between him and other business associates that really make this film stand out. It manages to remain an engaging and gripping thriller without having much action going on thanks to the performances and the atmosphere of the film. A Most Violent Year is a stylish thriller that hits the mark once again for Chandor, and he shouldn't be overlooked from now on.",A Most Violent Year
45,jimbo-53-186511,A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do,7,22 May 2015,"Despite the fact that this was a pretty decent film I can't help but wonder if the writers and filmmakers lacked a little confidence in their product. First and foremost let's look at the title 'A most violent year' - based on the title you would assume that this film would be a combination of gratuitous violence and multiple killings, but it actually doesn't play out like this at all. I can imagine that some people may have been disappointed that this wasn't a bloodbath like Scarface, but I actually liked this film. What you get here is a thoughtful character piece about one man doing everything in his power to protect the business that he's spent years building up. As the film progressed, I actually appreciated it more for not being what I expected.I was also impressed by the believable plot line and also in the sense that the film is grounded in reality; Abel is a businessman who is merely trying to expand his business - sure he cuts corners, but don't all rich people cut corners to get rich? There is nothing inherently bad about him as a person, but he merely does what he can to make sure he earns as much money as possible. I also liked the way that the writers made Abel an anti-cliché; here is a man that isn't even prepared to kill a deer so you know there's no way he can kill a man. Does that make him weak? Definitely not, but it merely makes him human and I think that was the point that was trying to be made here.The performances from Isaac and Chastain are both particularly good; although I do think that extra praise should go to Isaac for taking on a role that will inevitably mean that he'll be compared to Al Pacino. Personally, I thought Isaac put in a very good 'stand alone' performance and managed to get the required balance to make us see Abel as a likable rogue rather than a cold villain.A most violent year has a very cold and atmospheric feel to it and it reminded me of a lot of the mob films of old. The directing, editing and cinematography were all superb as well.As much as I enjoyed this film there was one weakness; I felt that the first 2/3 of the film didn't have me quite as engaged as the final third of the film (it seemed to jump around too much at the start). Even though the first 2/3 of the film were a little unfocused, the writers still did enough to hold my interest so it's only a minor criticism.A most violent year is a great film and is all the better for going against what I expected it to be. The mob aspect is merely used as a backdrop and the film essentially acts more as a character study about the lengths that one man will go to in order to protect both his business and his family",A Most Violent Year
46,peterp-450-298716,That year wasn't that violent after all ...,4,20 February 2015,"""If I were you, I would start treating us with a little more respect or I guarantee he will make it his mission in life to ruin you."" New York,1981. The most violent year in the history of the metropolis New York. No doubt about it, but that violence probably took place somewhere else than where this film took place. Are you expecting some sort of mafia film like ""Once upon a time in America"", ""The Godfather"", ""Scarface"" or ""The Untouchables"" ? Well sorry, but this will be a disappointment for you because it's not such type of mafia movie. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is the opposite of a Don Corleone. Anything that smells like mafia stuff or corruption, he tries to avoid studiously. He's trying to run his business in oil fair and square, without falling back on violent and corrupt interventions. And this despite the tough competition which apparently has no problem with applying harsh and intimidating methods. Abel, the epitome of honesty in these turbulent criminal years, faces terrified truck drivers and an increasing loss because of stolen oil. This together with an investigation by the District Attorney Lawrence (David Oyelowo), who is determined to uncover wrongdoings, ensures that an investment Morales trying to finalize with some Jewish businessmen, will be compromised and is doomed to fail.I didn't expect a film about a supplier of oil in the first place. It certainly provides opportunities for other business sectors to be placed at the center of public attention. After ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" and ""Promised Land"" it was time to put the hard-working fuel suppliers, who make sure that we ordinary citizens have a cozy warm house during a severe winter, in the spotlight. I don't want to have a prejudice against this noble profession, but as a subject, it resulted in a painfully slow movie in which there was not much to be seen. I did notice the terrible shortage of light-bulbs in that time. Large parts of the film are bathed in scorching darkness. Dark offices, dark corridors, nocturnal wanderings through the house and garden, dark tunnels and staircases. Probably it has to do with the fact that these were the most nefarious years and the protagonists were accustomed to nightly activities. Or it's because many things weren't allowed to see the light in that period ? I'm still completely in the dark about that.I'll be honest though. The performances are spectacular. Isaac plays the stubborn manager masterfully. Despite all the setbacks and the enormous pressure he remains determined on the outlined course he doesn't want to deviate from. Despite the warning from a union man that the truck drivers will abandon him and the continuing distrust of his wife Anna Morales (Jessica Chastain), which apparently has a mafia past, has a dizzying cleavage and commits the only violent offense in this film (with a poor deer as the victim), he doesn't want to yield to unfair practices. He fits perfectly in snowy New York. He's as cool and chilly. And that was my biggest problem with the characters. They are all totally numb. Anna is even colder than Abel. The only one who showed some emotions was Julian (Elyes Gabel) whose fear and desperation were believable.I've also seen A.J. Chandor's film ""All is lost"" long time ago and can only conclude that this film fits perfectly. ""All is lost"" was also visualized beautifully with an unusual rendition, but painfully slow and boring. Brilliant performances, elaborate personalities and expressive character roles serve as the foundation of timeless classics. But when a movie only contains that and has nothing else interesting to offer, you can be sure that a large part of the audience will be slightly disappointed. Including me.I'm sure that Morales has the saying ""Honesty is the best policy"" framed above his bed. And yet, his character was quite contradictory when it comes to being honest. The term ""morality"" is extremely valuable to Morales (What's in a name), but at the final confrontation with Lawrence, corruption comes into play. The ""like knows like"" feeling pops up and then finally Morales tends to do a favor in a way it's still applied nowadays in the world of business and politics. And the ultimate act in the end, with a banal handkerchief being used to seal a puncture in a huge oil tank, is implausible as a physical phenomenon and also in contradiction with the character of Abel. Apparently the business aspect is more important than the human aspect at that moment. Eventually still a ruthless businessman, our saint Abel.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",A Most Violent Year
47,jadepietro,A Most Vehement Film,6,7 February 2015,"This film is mildly recommended. (Rating: ☆☆☆) Let us begin... Now is the winter of our discontent...strike that... Then was the winter of our discontent... Specifically New York City, 1981.A good honest man was hard to find back then. And it seems that the only good honest man existing in this universe is Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), a shrewd entrepreneur fighting the forces of corruption that are rampant all around him. From businessmen to cops, from lawyers to politicians, no one is immune to the avarice and vice that were so prevalent of this era.Abel wants to live the American Dream. He is in the oil supply business and his successful start-up company has been having difficulty delivering their product as his trucks are being hijacked and the oil stolen. No one can or will help him. His pleas go unnoticed. Perhaps one reason may be that Abel's company is under investigation by an ambitious district attorney (a fine David Oyelowo) and his business expansion efforts are being severely hampered financially. His wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), fears for her family's safety and believes in violence as any means of self-protection. But her husband is a moral man who appears to be far too naive to his violent bedfellows in this world of business. ￼ A Most Violent Year is a slow-moving crime drama that is far too convoluted that needed. The wheeler-dealings and money transactions, at times, preempt the more interesting action and mystery elements of J. C. Chandor's literate screenplay. Some characters serve as mere plot devices used to help the logistics of the story. The end results are intriguing but never amount to much excitement. One invests much time and effort in the film only to be somewhat let down by the lack of cohesion.As a director, Chandor captures the eighties look with wonderful period details. The hair, make-up, and clothes give the film a wonderful style of authenticity. He also assembled a fine cast to make his clever dialog evoke a vital sense of naturalism. There is no question about Chandor's filmmaking skills and passion. Unfortunately, this film doesn't emotionally involve the movie-going audience due to his leisurely pacing and some script contrivances.However, it is the film's acting that is exceptional, with strong support from Albert Brooks, Peter Gerety, and Alessandro Nivola. Giving an especially memorable turn is Elyses Gabel as a frighten driver and loyal friend to Abel and the talented Ms. Chastain. Her nuanced acting allows her character to use Anna's sexuality to full advantage in order to hide a hard-as-nails interior most effectively. But the film belongs to Mr. Isaac who brings a Travolta / Pacino swagger to his complicated role and controls his character's moments of inner turmoil with sudden burst of violence that delineate a man on the verge of a breakdown. (The actor's subtle touch toward the film's bloody climax more than shows Abel's transformation from the tragic occurrences that befall him.) A Most Violent Year may not fully achieve its goal of uniting story and image, but it is a well- crafted film worth seeing.

He has been building his business of fuel distribution to quite a big position. He now lands a deal to purchase a bay-front storage facility that will increase the business greatly. But this deal has a risky clause which states that if Abel fails to pay the rest of the due payment, the facility and the deposit will be gone. His trucks have been targeted by robbers from the last few months, which scared his drivers. He even gets an intimidation visit by burglars. Additionally, the DA wants to charges the business with felony counts. His wife suddenly reveals a gun she purchases for her protection, of which he strongly disagrees. Despite his disapproval, Abel's drivers arm themselves with guns but lack the permit for them. When another heist occurs and one of his driver fires shots, Abel has to go himself and find the missing driver to turn him to the police. The driver Julian is found, but he ran away when he's about to be turned in. Abel goes every where to get loans as the closure time nears. From one of his competitors the Lefkowicz, Abel gets a deal for 500 thousand dollars or the 1.5 millions he needs. The facility owner grants him an extra three day time, in which he uses to see his brother to ask him to mortgage his apartment to help Abel. He also convenes all his other surrounding competitors saying that he knows at least one of them is in league with his trucks' hijackers. On his way home he accidentally finds one of his trucks being hijacked. He follows the truck through a chase. After capturing the robber he finds that one of his competitors has been buying the stolen fuel. When the money needed is only 600 thousand more, he runs out of time. But his wife suddenly pulls out a bank account with enough cash in it. To his surprise, his wife has been skimming money from the company all this time. Finally he decides to use the money and completes the deal. Julian comes to the facility; angry thinking that he gets nothing while Abel gets everything. Abel convinces him there's a second chance, but he commit suicide then and there. Abel then asks for a deal with the visiting DA for his business.The story nicely encompasses the vigilant businessman character. It also depicts nicely all those pressure from every side that can eventually break someone's fortitude on principles. The character focus greatly emphasized on Abel, his vigilance on doing things straight, and his ways to inspire people around him to do the same. Ultimately we get to see how situation and circumstance can get the best of even a strongly principled man.The drama part is nicely very strong despite all those suspenseful thriller parts coming in and out of the screen. The movie nicely puts a high level of anticipation on the audience about what kind of suspense the movie may bring, although if we think of it, the suspense this movie presents isn't really that strong. One thing that feels like a large plot hole is the side plot with the sales trainee; who did the family worked with to frame the kid?The screenplay is nicely quite unpredictable and can shift almost instantaneously from the drama side to the thriller side with just a few scene or angle cuts. Thus the movie can maintain its steady mood of overall gloomy and dark. The constant depiction of winter snow weather really helps a lot in building this mood despite the use of quite bright lighting choice. The coloration of the movie also enables it to feel more authentic to the time frame.I like how the acting overall is fairly good, although I wouldn't say that this movie holds any of the star cast's outstanding performance. Oscar Isaac handled the main focus role well enough by portraying the cool but strong businessman. Jessica Chastain provided the wife angle nicely and played well into the ending twist's critical point. David Oyelowo played quite nice here although it's really shown that maybe his concentration was more on Selma (2014) rather than this movie.A mere 6 out of 10 is a deserving score I give to A Most Violent Year (2014). It's a good entertainment but it falls into the more serious type that I just don't give a recommendation to go see it in the movies. It may become too boring for some people.",A Most Violent Year
49,JuguAbraham,Shades of morality in USA including morality on the use of music,7,5 May 2015,"I just watched J C Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year."" I was first delighted and then shocked as I listened to the bars of the theme music which is ""lifted"" from Hans Zimmer's music used in Malick's ""The Thin Red Line."" And there is no due acknowledgement to either Zimmer's or Malick's work in the credits of Chandor's film. Did no one in USA notice this to this day? I wonder what Chandor has to say.A film on the varied shades of morality reminds one of Tony Gilroy's fine debut effort ""Michael Clayton."" But Gilroy appeals to a viewer because the really morally good wins in the end. while in Chandor's film the ""good"" forces that win are not truly good, just merely better than some other forces discussed in the script. It is almost like ""Nightcrawler"" where the downright evil forces thrive in USA and the audience is supposed to like it.I have thus very mixed feelings to Chandor; he has shown both sides of his creativity, he is better than the average Hollywood director when it comes to style, while he is questionable on matters stated above.",A Most Violent Year
50,Sergeant_Tibbs,Sizzles with tension. A Most Violent Year is one of the most complete packages of the year.,8,4 February 2015,"J.C. Chandor is a filmmaker who has been immediately met with acclaim. His debut film Margin Call was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, a citation that I don't think was deserved, and his followup All Is Lost is well crafted with an excellent performance from Robert Redford, if lacking in a few areas. A Most Violent Year is the first film of his I can fully get on board with. I love films like these and there's been an abundance of films about ambition, the American dream, success and failure and what that all means to the ego and the country. Such as Whiplash, Nightcrawler and Foxcatcher, A Most Violent Year is one of the year's best, and just as dark and thoughtful as those. It's probably the most sensitive of the lot. What makes it work is that it doesn't immediately dip toes into crime. Instead, it relies on chaotic probability, power struggles and inherent cynicism in a capitalist world.It's an incredibly organic film in the way it unravels. Characters aren't looking for trouble, but it finds them, and the way they deal with it ring absolutely true. Even so, Chandor still has elegantly crafted sequences that sum up its themes in poetic metaphors without being too heavy handed. Oscar Isaac is terrific, exemplifying the nuances that made Inside Llewyn Davis such a treat. He's especially great in the second half where he's faced with the biggest dilemmas. We have a real rising star on our hands. An actress who's still sizzling at the top, Jessica Chastain steals the show, toeing lines between rational and irrational and having electric chemistry with the rest of the cast. Coupled with expertly atmospheric cinematography from Bradford Young and a disconcerting score from Alex Ebert, including a masterpiece final track that finishes the narrative with dynamite ironic twists, A Most Violent Year is one of 2014's most complete packages.8/10",A Most Violent Year
51,brchthethird,A slow and calculated look at the thin line between business and crime,8,7 May 2015,"Most of the complaints I've seen being leveled against this film from some of the recent reviews here say something about it being too slow, or boring, not enough action, etc. Objectively speaking, they might be partially right, but that doesn't make this film objectively bad. A MOST VIOLENT YEAR will probably not be to everyone's taste, particularly those who want something with higher stakes or a more high-octane feel to it, but for people who appreciate a moody, character-driven drama this should do just fine. The film is set in 1981 New York, apparently one of the most violent years on record. Oscar Isaac plays Abel Morales, the owner of a heating oil delivery company who quite ambitious but also cautious in the way he does business. His wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), is a variation on the gangster's moll who lets her husband run things the way he wants to, but not without letting him hear her opinions. The two make quite a nice pairing and contrast with each other in very interesting ways, most importantly in how to best secure themselves against the rash of violence coming over their city. Thematically, the director J.C. Chandor is very interested in the morality of doing business and the fine line between ""accepted practice"" and gangsterism. It's also a story about an immigrant navigating his way among sharks as he attempts to build his version of the American dream. While this territory has been covered before, J.C. Chandor takes a step back and looks at it with a colder, more steely gaze. Everything from the shot choices to the hazy color correction suggests a calculation that is necessary in a murky, uncertain situation, and the tension that builds up in certain scenes, as well as over the course of the film, is palpable. And everything from the performances and overall put-togetherness of the film conveys the calculated intentions of the director, much like Abel is in his business dealings. Ultimately, given the slow and cerebral nature of the film, this is something easier to admire than actively enjoy. Still, it was a very interesting character study that was able to maintain an excellent level of tension throughout its 2-hour running time.",A Most Violent Year
52,proud_luddite,A good crime film,7,13 January 2019,"Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain portray Abel and Anna Morales, a couple who own and run a heating oil company in 1981 in New York City. Abel tries his best to run his business as cleanly as possible in a corrupt industry. One of their frequent problems is having their oil trucks hijacked, sometimes violently thus putting their truck drivers in danger.Director/writer J.C. Chandor uses a lot bleak and dark lighting throughout the film which helps to keep the viewer distant from the characters. While less distance might have created a more fulfilling experience, there is at least a consistency that can be commended.Also commendable is a story with various plot lines but always understandable, a rarity in many modern crime films. While the film is seen through the eyes of Abel, it includes the view of a working-class employee whose plight is almost dismissed as trivial to the the wealthy couple.Isaac and Chastain do a fine job in their roles. As the head of a wealthy family empire, it's fascinating how much Isaac resembles Al Pacino (aka Michael Corleone of ""The Godfather"" films) at the same age.While ""A Most Violent Year"" doesn't meet the higher standards of other crime classics, it is still quite entertaining.",A Most Violent Year
53,maurice_yacowar,Latino businessman loses integrity to succeed in business,8,4 February 2015,"Though writer/director J.C. Chandor sets this neo-noir in 1981 New York City, the recent peak of corruption and violence, it reflects equally on the current tarnish of the American Dream. As a result of unfettered capitalism the virtuous hero cannot succeed without seriously compromising himself.Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac, a planet away from his Llewyn Davis) plays an ambitious Latino determined to become an American success without compromising his ethics. He dresses elegantly, tastefully, without the flash of the old film gangster. His speech and comportment show a man of tight control. He knows where he wants to get to — but will only take ""the right path.""He bought his gangster father-in-law's heating oil business but wants to succeed honestly. He has followed the standard practices of the industry. Now, as he struggles to raise the $1.5 million he needs to close the purchase of a waterfront property to receive and store international shipments, he's threatened with criminal charges and suffers violent thefts of his oil. He resists the teamsters' thuggish insistence on arming his drivers. He's buying the property from an Orthodox Jewish businessman who is, like Abel, committed to an archaic code of conduct. He'll flex to give Abel three extra days to raise the money, but he won't be in the same room with Abel's wife when she has to sign the contract. Morales is a man of morals but he's not quite Abel to sustain them — if he wants to succeed. To save his business he has to borrow from a rival at a usurious rate, mortgage the apartment building he shares with his kid brother and — climactically — tap the large sum his wife has been — without his knowledge — skimming off from the company. That's tax evasion, the sub-standard practice of American business. Though that saves him from borrowing from a gangster, to escape the criminal charges Abel has to promise to support the DA's political ambitions. So if Abel manages not to be owned by the gangster, he slips into a corrupt coalition with Lawrence ((David Oyelowo), the DA turned self-serving politician.In a twist on the genre Abel's enemy is not some gang boss, as he suspects, but free-lancers who have been stealing his loads to sell to his rivals. That's the trickle-up theory of corruption, ambitious individuals working on their own, against the law, but abetted and rewarded by Abel's rivals, who buy their plunder.Like Abel, his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) has climbed out of Brooklyn to live the high life. They've just moved into a new suburban estate. She wears only Armani. As Chastain plays her, her accent shifts between Brooklyn and Manhattan, like the two sets of books she she has maintained, and she doesn't share her husband's aversion to guns and their deployment. She's proud that her husband is unlike her gangster dad, but it's her calculated crookedness that saves Abel/s fortunes.In contrast to Abel's success, his hapless friend Julian (Elyes Gabel) aspires to Abel's success. His plan is to progress from driving to sales, but he's broken by the assault he suffers from thieves. On his first trip back he fights off the robbers with an illicit gun then flees. He doesn't have Abel's discipline or strength. He cracks under the feeling of vulnerability that stimulates Abel. Ultimately Julian is helpless, with nowhere to go, a family to support, no hope, so he kills himself. Abel's first move is to stanch the tank's bleed of oil. That's the black blood at the heart of American capitalism. The film closes with Alex Ebert singing his own stark summary of the film, ""America For Me."" It's a bitter song, about the ambition and selfishness that by denying compassion make even the apparent winners losers.",A Most Violent Year
54,Richie-67-485852,A Violent Year Handled Well,8,2 February 2015,"Here is a good story acted and directed well enough so that your enjoyment levels are never disengaged for the next two hours. First off, the price of a ticket is well spent here. Then, there so many scenes that invoke a viewers choices not unlike real life situations that may have you cringing or grasping the arm of your viewing chair...a good thing. Why? You are being entertained! It was interesting to compare what the character was doing and why with what I personally would have done. We were not always in agreement and a tug of war that has its origins in the butterfly section of your tummy kicks in beautifully. Another thing is that this movie is character driven not in the sense of ""players"" but in the virtues of life showing that there are other ways to handle dicey situations other than what the current action, adventure and drama movies offer as a standard of procedure. Not only are temptations abounding in the movie, but solutions to them all doable while the theme of righteousness or doing right is presented. Action, story plot, good directing and real life other choices all help this movie make its points...Give us more of this and watch movie going have a good, predictable year. Must have popcorn, sweet snack and a tasty drink or fingernails will be in danger",A Most Violent Year
55,adamscastlevania2,Worth it for Mr Isaac alone,8,3 February 2015,"(76%) There are multiple reasons why this should be a prime target for most cinema fans, but the main reason of all is the ever impressive Oscar Isaac. He's fantastic here in the lead role toiling against what feels like everything to legitimately succeed as a fuel dealer during a crime plagued era in New York history. While backing him up brilliantly is Jessica Chastain as his glamorous, tough, yet fully supportive wife. The direction from the outset is silky smooth, while still very calculated. But there are clear issues surrounding the film's momentum as this flat- out refuses to break away from its total sense of realism, meaning this is a easy film to respect, but fun to watch it ain't. Although in terms of a quality crime drama with real refinement in-front and behind the camera then look no further.",A Most Violent Year
56,cultfilmfan,A Most Violent Year,7,2 February 2015,"There were certainly enough things that I liked about the new film, A Most Violent Year, but unfortunately I did not find it to be a masterpiece, or even a great film. I find it hard in a lot of ways to exactly pinpoint my exact problem with the film. The film's lighting and cinematography was both excellent and using sparse and uninhabited backgrounds really gave the film a certain empty yet bleak feeling and I think it suited the film perfectly. The lighting was often using fluorescent lights and at times gave the film an almost haunting and depressing type of glow, which I think further added to the great look and feel of the film. I felt that all the film's acting was spot on and very good here, from the main actors to the supporting, everyone was really good here. So why did I have a problem with the film? I think because generally while the film did keep my interest and offered me a lot to admire about it, there was still not quite enough of the film for me to be fully and completely satisfied. Yes, it was an extremely well done film, but I think the area where the film was lacking, was in the screenplay department. I wouldn't say this was a huge problem of mine, but I did not like a single character in this movie and through it I had nobody to root for, or even to empathize with. All these characters are so cold, and self indulgent that I found nothing to relate to with them and just could not connect on any levels with them. I guess in their own way they were interesting enough to watch and it did hold the film, but I always do love some great character study where you can at least feel something for the characters, whether you like them, or not. And even though I did not particularly care for these characters, I still had no strong feelings for them either way, because in a lot of ways they just were not all that interesting. I have heard others say about this film and I will have to use the same line myself, that the film does take what could have been a really interesting premise, but in a lot of ways just does absolutely nothing with it, or live up to it's potential. The film could certainly feel a bit slow at times and by the end of the film, while I was never bored per se, I did feel a bit let down, that there was not more to this film, or to the characters. Often it felt distant and separated from me the viewer and just allowed me no ways in which I could connect, or even care about the characters, or what is going on throughout the film. It is too bad because the film technically is very well made and I think had they put a little extra work into the script, it could have been an entirely different film and overall a much better one, but as it stands it is just an average and mediocre film that I feel could have been great, but unfortunately never quite reached those goals.",A Most Violent Year
57,Quietb-1,Not too violent.,7,23 January 2015,"Here's a title that will drive away 50% of the movie going population. Another outstanding performance by Oscar Isaac, who seems just under the radar as a major talent. Jessica Chastain, who's packing, can't hide under wigs. Albert Brooks again flips from comedy to drama.It's a story about a mob controlled business on the East Coast. Odd that the Isaac character was a bit naive as he did get the business from his connected father-in-law.No need to see this on the big screen. It's a well done small movie that will play on a home platform. Don't run from the title as this is an engrossing ""Sapranos"" like movie.",A Most Violent Year
58,t-dooley-69-386916,"Nearly excellent, New York, period, crime drama.",7,9 June 2015,"This is a crime drama set in the New York winter of 1981; that was the most violent year recorded in the city's history and gives the film its title. Oscar Isaac plays Abel Morales an Hispanic immigrant who has worked his way up to be a major player in the fuel oil business. Jessica Chastain plays his accountant wife who has aided him in his achievements and is as strong as him in getting what she feels she deserves.Then he needs to expand his business, borrow a ton of cash whilst at the same time his business empire is under threat from assailants unknown. His lorries are being targeted, his drivers attacked and his fuel stolen all at a time when he least needs the attention. His morals of 'doing everything by the book' are sorely put to the test in a field where there are often no holds barred and the assistant DA wont help him. This is an exceptionally good film. It has you fully gripped from the start and the story itself has all the momentum of a run away goods train. The acting is superb, from Morales and Chastain down to the part players. The period detail is spot on too and the location shooting is in a class of its own. The only thing that let it down for me was the ending – to say why would be a plot spoiler. That said it is the journey that often matters rather than the destination and if that is the criteria then this was a journey worth taking.",A Most Violent Year
59,FilmMan47,The Most Slowest Year Ever,3,4 March 2015,"by the time this film ended i questioned myself that there is too much violence in the world happening around every day each year so why would anyone pick just out one year and make a film on it now it does not even matter whether is the story of this film is based on real life or not this certainly is a project that apes godfather series & tries to be cinematic as hard it can be but fails miserably makes the viewer wonder that both years 1981 the story of this film is set in & 2014 the release date of this film appear to be the most slowest years in history ever.this film is like a never ending episode of some late night TV show extended for no reason people are already comparing Oscar Isaac with Al Pacino,Robert De Niro i say how dare they those guys are legends this film does not even come close one bit to any classic out there.J.C Chandor's direction is awful too dark he tried to blend Little Christopher Nolan with a touch of David Fincher themes here that does not work at all the project looks like it was running without a script the center of attention are characters here mostly and not the actual story this is where it falls short.The Plot:Ny 1981 Abel Morales is going through rough times he is doing everything he can for the family and business in the most violent year ever.from oil tankers to business the topic was going fine until Abel's wife leaves no chance in making a mess out of his life then she is buying guns shooting deers on the road etc later on crime & drama starts with most boring dialogs ever written and climax is hilarious when a guy shoots himself in the chin Anna is the only one who screams are reacts so hard on it but the entire time before this she was behaving like the most inhumane person ever.The Cast:Oscar Issac is the only one seems to be taking his role seriously he did a great job he was calm and smooth in every scene he appears,Jessica Chastain is annoying as hell plus that fake blond wig Scarlett Johanson would have been a better choice for this role.i totally agree with critics and some film buffs who saw slow pace does not mean its some sort of masterpiece by any definition,i never expected any action at all but at least the narrative should movie a bit but sadly it just goes nowhere all those gang members & cops are wasted.this film is worth checking out only of Oscar Issac he is the best performer here not for a moment he will let the audience walk away from the hall.Overall A Most Violent Year is one of the most boring dull and unexciting films of 2014 my rating is 3/10.Below Average",A Most Violent Year
60,K3nzit,A solid period piece...,6,4 January 2020,"A solid period piece by the writer/director J.C. Chandor with Oscar Isaac as the lead. Visually stunning storytelling, but lacks a bit tension in dialogue.",A Most Violent Year
61,bryank-04844,"for those of us who love these types of films, 'A Most Violent Year' is a real treat.",8,12 August 2015,"By the title alone, you'd think this was in fact 'A Most Violent Year' or a very violent movie. However, that is not exactly the case here. In fact, it's far from it. J.C. Chandor's screenplay and film is a very slow burn that tells a story of the seedy underbelly of competing heating oil suppliers in 1981 New York City. The reason for the film's title is that 1981 was considered New York City's most violent year on record.Chandor has a knack for telling very compelling stories with a slow burn such as in 'Margin Call' and in 'All Is Lost', but with 'A Most Violent Year', we focus on a business man who is trying to run a lucrative business on the straight and narrow path in a setting where there are bad elements and gangsters everywhere. We closely follow Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) who runs a heating oil company in New York City. He meets with a few Hasidic Jews to buy their oil storage warehouses right off the docks. He puts down a down payment and must come up with the rest of the money in a month or lose the entire investment.This deal will put him on top of the oil business, and if it doesn't go through, he will lose everything. Meanwhile, as we see in the first scene, one of his truck drivers, Julian (Elyes Gabel) is viciously attacked and thrown out of his truck, while the attackers make off with the truck. This is happening more often than not to Abel's business, but he keeps his cool. Come to find out, Abel's wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) is the daughter of a notorious mob boss, who is responsible for giving Abel this oil business.But Abel is not in this for the crime or to do bad things. He's in it to provide for his family and run a legitimate business. But his wife thinks this is an all out war with other mafia families and tries to persuade him to take action. And I have to hand it to Chandor for keeping our main character Abel always calm and cool and never straying into the dark side. Even when the union tries to force the drivers to carry handguns, Abel refuses, inciting that it will only escalate things. In the meantime, the local assistant D.A. (David Oyelowo) is charging Abel with a few counts of fraud and cooking the books to which Abel's lawyer (Albert Brooks) is always by his side to give advice.As more and more of Abel's truck drivers and even salesmen are being brutally attacked, Abel must decide how to deal with this horrible situation and above all else, decide who is causing all of these problems. In a 'Godfather' like scene, Abel meets with the other oil companies to have a Pow Wow and figure out who is responsible, but nothing seems to get accomplished. As all of this is going on, Abel still has to come up with money to pay the Hasidic Jews.It's such a treat to watch the well coiffed Oscar Issac play his role with such a cool demeanor, never caving into violent tactics or hurting anyone. And Chastain's performance of his outspoken thrill seeking wife is a lot of fun to watch. J.C. Chandor has almost perfectly concocted a story of a man who is willing to do anything to stay on the righteous path. It's a slow film that is full of the best kind of drama between characters, but it might not have enough energy to garner a large audience. But for those of us who love these types of films, 'A Most Violent Year' is a real treat.",A Most Violent Year
62,timdalton007,A Most Methodical Film,8,6 May 2015,"I'm going to start this review by saying that this film is not my usual cup of tea. I don't go in for the crime/gangster film genre very often, partly because it doesn't particularly interest me and partly because the genre (like most genres to be fair) has become littered with one clichéd film after another. Yet my curiosity was peaked by an NPR interview with Jessica Chastain about her role and the clips played from the film there. I'd have to wait until the DVD release to see it though and it turned out to be well worth the wait as A Most Violent Year, set in 1981 New York City, is one of the best films of last year and one that seems to have passed largely under the radar of everyone who wasn't a critic.Anchoring the film are two extraordinary performances. The first is Oscar Issacs as Able Morales, a man who has worked to build his heating oil company over the previous few years who finds himself on the cusp of new success only to have an ever increasing amount of obstacles in his way from accusations of crimes to his fuel trucks being hijacked. Issacs performance, drawing of course from the script, presents a compelling portrait of a man who seems to have everything as it is who keeps on trying to do more. As he does, he tries to stay on the right side of the law, to be an honest man in an increasingly dishonest world and at times struggling to remain so. It's a compelling performance to say the least.The other extraordinary performance, and one that steals every scene in its in, comes from Jessica Chastain as Anna, Able's mob daughter wife. There's almost a Lady Macbeth quality to Anna that Chastain brings to the fore: he may the one who owns the business and makes the decisions but she is the proverbial power behind the throne who pushes her husband forwards. She is forceful, making her presence known when she has to such as in a scene alongside the young Assistant District Attorney trying to bring them down where she warns him not to underestimate them (by which she really means her). If Able is the one struggling with his morals in an increasingly amoral world, Anna is the one who has no qualms and is willingly to openly confront her husband about it. As a result, Chastain's performance is a powerful presence in the film and it forces you to watch her in every scene she appears in.Beyond Issacs and Chastain, there's strong performances throughout the film. There's Albert Brooks as the Morales' lawyer Andrew Walsh, David Oyelowo as Assistant District Attorney Lawrence and Jerry Adler as Josef. The standout performance from the supporting cast though might be Elyes Gabel as Julian, one of the Morales' young drivers who makes for an interesting contrast with Able with whom he bares quite a bit of common. Gabel's performance is a compelling one and makes for an intriguing addition and contrast with the performances of Issacs and Chastain. Overall, the cast is a strong one full of compelling and believable performances.Moving beyond the cast, the film itself comes across well. The sets and costumes, along with some excellent location filming, gives the film an incredible sense of atmosphere as well as a sense of time and place. Rarely has a film successfully recreated the recent past as well as A Most Violent Year does 1981 New York City from the suburban home of the Morales to the offices and public places that they find themselves wandering through as events unfold. The cinematography of Bradford Young gives the entire film an impressionistic feel that wonderfully contemplates unfolding events, sometimes in a wonderfully surreal fashion. Last, but certainly not least, is the score from Alex Ebert is sparse and wonderfully underpins the events unfolding when it is used, acting in concert with the aforementioned elements to give a sense of the time and place as it infuses musical elements from the era with its mix of synthesizer tracks with the occasional piece of orchestra.What makes all of that work though is J. C. Chandor's direction and script. Both are methodical, unfolding over two hours as it plays out the events of a month in the titular most violent year (1981) in one of the largest cities in the world. As well as being a fascinating portrait of New York City in that year, it's also a study of those trying to make a living in that world from the top down. There's multiple stories going on around Able and Anna from their business to criminal investigations and how the lives of those around them intersect (and often conflict) with theirs. Chandor never gives in to the clichés of the crime genre, which not only makes the film standout from the pack but gives it a strong sense of intelligence as it presents adults in adult situations sometimes struggling with those events and the decisions they have to make. The results are fascinating and compelling despite the film's methodical pacing.Saying that, I strongly suspect that A Most Violent Year isn't a film for everyone. It's a methodical piece of work, unfolding over the two hours in a piece by piece fashion that will likely drive those with short attention spans or craving action stir crazy. But, like a bottle of a good wine, it has plenty to offer for those willing to savor and enjoy it, taking in all that it offers. From its performances to its production values and intelligent script, it proves to be one of the best films of 2014 and a film that will hopefully find the audience it missed the first time around.",A Most Violent Year

64,cliftonofun,"A wee bit slow, but worth the wait",8,27 December 2017,"Chandor has a gift: the tension simmers, the conflict builds and the characters face human conflicts. It doesn't matter whether it is Wall Street corruption, shipwrecks or family business, every movie feels high stakes. The story telling is tight, and the imagery is tighter. Performances like Isaac's here are rare, but the ability to harness them is rare too. This film is MacBeth set in 1981 New York. I wanted it to boil faster, but it cooked anyway. And the final shots were perfect.",A Most Violent Year
65,SquigglyCrunch,Not What I Expected but Still Great,8,7 June 2016,"A Most Violent Year follows a man and his wife who are running a big fuel company when people start stealing from them. Additionally, they run into some legal issues and have to manage both things at the same time. Before you watch this movie know this: IMDb says its an action movie, but it's not. It's a crime drama, only with a much heavier emphasis on the drama. So don't expect any big awesome shootouts or explosions. To start the actors are all pretty great, especially Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. I watched this movie partially because I like both of these actors, and like I said they didn't disappoint. Their characters weren't terribly complex or anything, so it wouldn't be very difficult to pull them off, but for what they were they were great. The characters are pretty interesting as well. They're realistic and while they aren't horribly deep or anything, they're still good. The plot and presentation is great. There isn't very much music, nor does a whole lot of awesome stuff happen. So when music is used and something awesome does happen, it's a way bigger deal and just that much more awesome. Overall A Most Violent Year is a solid movie. The performances are good, the characters are interesting, and the presentation is great. In the end I would recommend this movie.",A Most Violent Year

67,DareDevilKid,A Compelling if Slightly Undercooked Crime Yarn,7,12 February 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsMultilayered and morally nuanced - ""A Most Violent Year"" - is a crime drama about the sort of character who is a peripheral figure in most crime dramas. The protagonist, Abel is neither cop nor crook; he's just a compromised man with problems to solve. The underside of the ""American Dream"" is abundantly on display in this story about an immigrant endeavoring to make his way to the top while keeping his family safe and striving to maintain his position as the head-of-the-house.Set during the winter of 1981 - statistically one of the most crime- ridden times in New York City's history - ""A Most Violent Year"" follows the lives of an immigrant and his family as they attempt to capitalize on the American Dream, while the rampant violence, decay, and corruption of the city drag them in threaten to destroy all they have built, and possibly even unhinge their moral compass.""A Most Violent Year"" is consistent with writer-director J. C. Chandor's previous films, the financial-crisis drama ""Margin Call"" (2011) and the Robert Redford survivalist saga ""All Is Lost"" (2013). These all are portraits of men in crisis, threatened by disasters with a deadline. Here, Chandor charts the moral decline accompanying financial gain with weary-eyed aplomb. It might not be the next great mob movie it's been advertised as, but it's still an articulately-knitted crime story, a thoughtful character study, and a terrific concoction of pressure cooker situations.Moreover, the movie never feels rushed - Chandor sets a tempo that allows Isaac to play his character with control while giving Chastain the time she needs to manipulate behind the throne. Some of the film's best moments center on those in which Isaac and Chastain argue the merits of the course their future should take. And just in case you hadn't noticed yet, Oscar Isaac is the real deal - even drawing analogies with a young Pacino in ""The Godfather"", nonetheless. His is one of the best performances of the year, which sadly - just like Gyllenhaal in ""Nightcrawler"" - has been overlooked by the Academny panel. Albert Brooks and Elyes Gabel (in a small role) from the TV show ""Scorpion"" also get noticed. Sadly, David Oyelowo, after mesmerizing us with his true potential in this year's ""Selma"", is cast in yet another under-written role.If one were to gripe about this crime drama, I guess it would have to be about the apparent lack - or watered-down portrayal - of violence in a movie centering on violence, depicting a famous city's most violent times, and bearing the term ""violence"" in its title. Though it might never be held in the same regard as some other American crime classics, ""A Most Violent Year"" is, nevertheless, well-made, focused, gritty, and grips our attention and morals - not many films could claim to take a hold of both - from start to finish, presenting another strong entry in writer-director J.C. Chandor's impressive filmography.",A Most Violent Year
68,rubenm,A Most Enjoyable Movie,7,11 February 2015,"'Money, we make it. Before we see it, you'll take it'. Those are the lyrics of 'Inner City Blues', the Marvin Gaye song playing over the opening credits of 'A Most Violent Year'. Not often does a song on the soundtrack describe the theme of the movie so well. While Marvin Gaye sings his song, we see the New York businessman Abel Morales jogging through the desolate industrial landscape of Brooklyn. Morales is a man determined to make money, but others are just as determined to take it from him. Morales's mission in life is to make it as an honest, decent businessman, who offers good service to his clients, treats his employees well, and pays his taxes to the government. But he is under pressure from three sides. Authorities are starting an investigation into his accounts, which turn out to be not as clean as he wishes. His competitors are behind several violent attacks on his trucks, delivering heating oil to his clients. Under these difficult circumstances, he has to convince the bank to lend him 1,5 million dollar to buy an oil terminal he has set his eyes on. Things go wrong and Morales has to lower his moral standards in order to survive as a businessman. 'Hang ups, let downs, bad breaks, set backs', continues Marvin Gaye. The film shows Morales's struggle with his own business ethics. Oscar Isaac is great in this role: Morales always stays in control, makes the right judgments, says the correct things, but you can see that he is boiling with anger inside. Even more so when he discovers that his wife, played by a superb Jessica Chastain, doesn't really share his own high standards. 'Make me wanna holler, and throw up both my hands', sings Marvin Gaye. The story is set against the backdrop of Brooklyn in 1981, a year in which crime in New York City was at its highest point. Apart from the attacks on Morales's trucks, there is not much violence in the movie. But the grimy, desolate cityscape of factories, railways and oil terminals give the impression of a city in decline, headed for its downfall. One scene in a graffiti- stained subway train, filled with apathetic New Yorkers, is symbolic for the state of mind at that time. 'Crime is increasing, trigger happy policing', croons Marvin Gaye. The very last scene of 'A most violent year' is the best. On the premises of Morales's newly acquired oil terminal, with a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline, a bullet from a gun kills a man and makes a hole in one of the oil tanks. Morales ignores the dead man, lying in a puddle of blood. Instead, he calmly heads for the hole, causing a tiny stream of black oil staining the white paint of the tank. He slowly pulls out a white handkerchief, and puts it in the hole. Business comes first, before anything else. One more time Marvin Gaye: 'God bless you, and Lord keep you'.",A Most Violent Year

He never seemed like a leading man type, but after seeing him in Inside Llewyn Davis and this, I'm having a change of opinion.David Oyelowo is another one I need to watch out for, although it's not hard, as he's been appearing in a lot of films, and gives a great performance no matter how small his supporting role isThe lovely Jessica Chastain is in the movie as well, being very brilliant and very sexy. I only wish she had more time on screen cause she's lovely to watch in all aspects.The film also stars Albert Brooks in a role I feel he got because of his outstanding performance in Drive.It's a very quiet movie with a lot of the drama coming from things not said but suggested. Not much action, but the little bit did get my blood pumping. It also had humor in the drama. It really does feel like it was done in 1981 too. Such a brilliant job by the filmmakers.",A Most Violent Year
70,ClaytonDavis,"Chandor orchestrates his finest effort, anchored by bravura turns by Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, and Elyes Gabel..",9,16 November 2014,"Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)At the Museum of Modern Art, New York audiences were treated to the ""New York Premiere"" of J.C. Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year,"" as a part of their Contenders 2014 series. Chandor's previous films ""Margin Call"" and ""All is Lost"" were also screened there over the years. The former is a well-told story, which garnered Chandor an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The latter, was well-admired, featuring a beloved turn from Robert Redford, and only managed a single nomination for Best Sound Editing. Chandor produces his finest effort yet with ""A Most Violent Year"" featuring two powerhouse performances from Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain.Chandor gets his hands on some of the most talented and undervalued people in the film business for A24's newest venture. Cinematographer Bradford Young showed his best Terrence Malick-like aesthetic with his work on ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints,"" probably his most recognized work up until now. He showed his abilities and the depth of his scope with the little seen ""Middle of Nowhere"" from Ava DuVernay in 2012, and ""Pariah"" by Dee Rees from 2011. His visual eye is simply remarkable, and what he captures in Chandor's newest, is some of the DP's most calculated and precise efforts. New York City, 1981, is the backdrop of our film, but along with Young's camera work, Chandor's focused direction and storytelling, and an ensemble that resonates profoundly, a new character is created before our eyes. Young inhabits the soul of that character. New York, you haven't felt this alive in cinema in quite sometime.One year after delivering THE performance of the year with ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" and being passed over by the Academy Awards and several major guilds, Oscar Isaac hits another one out of the park with his performance as Abel Morales, a man desperate to achieve the American dream. Isaac, who is both complex and satisfying, is richly devoted and impeccably raw. With his work on display, he shoots to the near top of today's best working actors. Isaac's turn is easily one of the year's most invigorating and most exciting character studies, revealing only real and believable behavior. Intelligent, well-mannered, and downright fantastic, it's one of the best performances of the year.Jessica Chastain sinks her teeth into another meaty role and bites down hard as Anna Morales, Abel's wife. Reminiscent of a mixture of Jacki Weaver in ""Animal Kingdom"" and Laura Linney in ""Mystic River,"" Chastain constructs an enigmatic woman, a Lady MacBeth-type, but with an authentic style that steals the show. There are even elements that call back to something like Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct."" Definitely alluring, and inhabiting a sexiness you can't teach in Julliard, Chastain keeps the audience in the dark but with a complete hypnosis. She fixates on her motives with a terrifying determination, accompanied by a gritty script, and sets the screen ablaze word after word, minute after minute.The rest of the supporting cast delivers in their brief moments on- screen including Albert Brooks, David Oyelowo, and Alessandro Nivola. One of the great finds of the year, at least to those who appreciate a layered and bravura performance, is that of Elyes Gabel. Making a living on CBS's ""Scorpion,"" and with some remembering his work on the first two seasons of HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" I have to sadly admit to never hearing of him before (or realizing it was him). As Julian, Gabel takes on a fully, fleshed out supporting turn, commanding our attention, and earning every second of screen time. In a just world, we'd be talking about him as a serious Best Supporting Actor contender. Gabel is a marvel to witness.Composer Alex Ebert hits another career high with his score and original song titled, ""America for Me."" Ebert channels the tension of the scene within his composition, knowing exactly when to pull back, and hit the accelerator full force.The film is a slow simmer, ferociously brought to a boil, before unleashing its fury in a third act that is fully engrossing. Admittedly, it takes some time to wonder if the work is either earned or necessary. I kept going back to the last few moments, wondering if what I saw was ultimately satisfying. Days later, it stands out as one of the key scenes in film from the year overall. There's a brilliance to what Chandor decides to show and end in those moments. Unpredictable, and maybe not the note that audience members will want to go out on, but completely guided.""A Most Violent Year"" is one of the great modern crime thrillers, ultimately showing itself as one of the most enthralling experiences of the year. I thoroughly believe that a true Oscar contender is on our hands in several categories. Visibility, and a love for the movies, are the only requirements to enjoy this gem. A great piece of art that all should treat themselves to.",A Most Violent Year

72,ArchonCinemaReviews,A Most Average Film,5,19 January 2015,"Considering that J.C. Chandor's film is called A Most Violent Year there is very little violence and the film is so slow the passage of time is undetectable.It is New York City of the early 1980's, and the Manhattan of that time is a far cry from the wealthy bourgeois city of today. 1981 is the year of the film A Most Violent Year, in which the audience follows an ambitious self-made businessman as he tries to fight to maintain his business and protect his family. The year of 1981 is also the year the most violent crimes occurred ever in New York City and it was statistically at its most dangerous.The Morales family owns one of the top oil transporters and distributors of New York City. The business used to belong to the father of Abel Morales's wife Anna, played by Jessica Chastain. The industry can be ruthless but Abel, Oscar Isaac, hopes to navigate the cutthroat capitalistic atmosphere by doing right by his moral code. His business is under siege from all angles when thieves begin targeting and stealing his oil trucks, he becomes the subject of three legal cases from an assistant district attorney and he is trying to close one of the riskiest financial maneuvers of his career.J.C. Chandor writes and directs A Most Violent Year which blatantly rips off and tries to emulate other films with a similar plot. The idea for setting the film in NYC during the most dangerous and tumultuous year of the city for A Most Violent Year is intriguing and interesting. Yet the completed film lacks anything gritty or interesting to capitalize on said premise nor eludes to the city of New York in any way. The rest of the film is also just as ambiguous and undefined, and most of the plot progression seemingly occurs through the exposition of dialogue. Perhaps the ambiguity was deliberate in the hopes of being symbolically important and revealing, but instead is just dull.The characters themselves are also played in a way that vividly brings to mind previous portrayals that were more successful. Oscar Isaac appears to be doing his best Al Pacino impression, especially every time he says the words 'my family' when he should be saying 'my business.' Jessica Chastain is the female archetype of any stronger female personality from any mob movie: think Sharon Stone in Casino but without the drug addiction and trashy back story or Talia Shire's Connie in The Godfather but with more participation in the business. Neither performances are unique or imaginative and with a plot as solemn and repetitive as the one in A Most Violent Year, are not redemptory.Chandor can tell the audience that the film is happening in the most violent year, but in failing to show me he misses the most impactful aspect of the film. The brunt of action in A Most Violent Year happens in the last 30minutes, but that is only if you make it through the previous 90 minutes of tedium.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases and awards contenders.",A Most Violent Year
73,david-meldrum,"Good, But Never Quite Elevated To The Heights It Could Reach",7,19 July 2020,"An excellent cast can't quite take this up to the league it aspires to; for a mob movie, it's more on the intimate rather than epic end of the genre. It tells the story of a couple who seem to be in over their heads in trying to establish themselves in a New York that's experiencing it's most violent year on record and that's in the grip of mob interests. The problem is that the film can't quite decide which side of the story to give most airtime to - the mob business or the story of a couple under pressure, struggling to prove themselves and stay alive. The latter seems more interesting to me - the superb Jessica Chastain seems more decisive and competent than her onscreen husband who can probably sense that truth at an instinctive level, hence not allowing her to step into the leadership role she could and should be in. Only once in the film (when a dying animal is put out of its misery) does she take the bull by the horns, and then it's a shock to him - one which angers him. But this story is given less room to breathe, pulsing below the surface, pulsing below the surface and occasionally being allowed up for air. It's gripping, and the film ends on an intriguing note - but there's the sense that we could and should have had more of the dynamics of the couple at the heart of this film that would have elevated the film to greater heights.",A Most Violent Year
74,LloydBayer,"Tightly wound, seamlessly assembled and expertly told, A Most Violent Year is a film that commands attention and respect.",9,5 February 2015,"Slowly stretch a rubber band between two fingers and you feel an invisible force building up on both ends. Now imagine drawing an arrow and holding that embryonic force for 125 minutes. Such is the exhaustive yet powerfully gripping nature of A Most Violent Year – a microscopic character study that dissects morality down to its nucleus; and then some.At the outset, I must admit that going in for this film, I was expecting something along the lines of a Francis Ford Coppola crime caper. Ostensibly, the title will do that to you but rather than calling it a curve ball, I'll just say it's writer-director J. C Chandor's swirl of a double edged boomerang. Set in the winter of 1981 New York, the titular year is an actual reference to the most violent year in the city's history. It's a thematically rich setting for an era that inspired some of the most memorable crime dramas in cinema history. A Most Violent Year has a lot of that flair but there exists a fine line between organized crime and the moral dilemma of protagonist Abel Morales (Oscar Issac). As a sort of conduit to biblical reference, Abel is hardworking and ethical, but also a hawkeyed businessman making headway in the heating oil industry. Having taken over the company from his father-in-law, a known mobster, Abel faces possible indictments from the District Attorney's office with reason to believe his business is involved in industry wide corruption. His bookkeeper wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) assures him they have nothing to worry about but Abel has bigger fish to fry. After a 40 percent down payment on an oil storage terminal, Abel has to come up with the remaining amount in a month or risk loosing his entire business. But then his supply trucks start getting hijacked, and Abel finds his integrity as a businessman tested. His options – track down his aggressors lawfully, or allow his wife to call in mob intervention.Part of what makes Chandor's screenplay an enduring force is Abel's unpredictable outcome in pursuing the American Dream. And while each predicament escalates into dangerous situations for his family and his business, you eagerly expect Abel to turn to the dark side, a side of him that we often see bubbling under the surface. But as it turns out, Abel has ice in his veins, thus stretching that rubber band even further. You never know when he will snap. Supplementing Chandor's throwback to the late 70s era of gangster films is Issac's choice in casting – an uncanny resemblance to Al Pacino's looks, style, and disposition some 40 years ago. In a mesmerizing turn as a man with executable power, both latent and surging, Oscar Issac is simply phenomenal and a rising talent to watch out for. And although Issac is tasked with anchoring this original story, Chastain is equally commanding and versatile by exhibiting fiery pep as a mother, a wife, and a daughter with connections to the mafia. Together, their on screen chemistry is bizarre but strangely alluring when allowing us to mull over who wears the pants.At the time of writing this review, A Most Violent Year has been snubbed for the 2015 Academy Awards. It's a shame considering how remarkably close this film is in style and atmosphere to some big titles from the likes of Coppola or Martin Scorsese. With deliberate pacing and drawn out conversations, this is not a 'bada-bing bada-boom' sort of crime drama, but as homage, or not, this film is only Chandor's third foray as a director and its exceptional quality is riveting enough for us (and the Academy) to stand up and take notice. All is Not lost, Mr. Chandor.",A Most Violent Year
75,dansview,Slow but Stylish Noir,6,3 August 2018,"The main actor was magnetic. Imagine a cool, stylish, calm, Italian, New York gangster, who is neither a gangster, nor Italian, but seems mildly like both. I've never heard of this guy, but he either pulled it off really well, or he is like that in real life.
In the film he is an Hispanic business owner who must walk the tightrope of ethics in order to compete, but also married a gangster's daughter. But he himself is a decent man who is passionate about limiting unethical or immoral behavior. In that sense a rather refreshing character for a modern movie. 
But then it doesn't take place in the modern era. It's in the early 80's. Through use of subtle techniques, not bombardment, we do get a feeling for the time period. Something about the quality of the film stock and the cars, hairstyles, and clothes helps. But there is no obnoxious soundtrack.
 The man deals in heating oil, but there isn't an explanation for what that means. Those of us from other parts of the country or other eras don't necessarily understand who uses this, and for what specifically
Meanwhile it would have been nice to hear a bit more about his background, how he acquired this business, how he developed his philosophy, and why he married this woman. Presumably because she is tougher than him. But did her dad set him up with the business? Well the ethics of the city oil business is not a sexy subject, but the actor's film noir mannerisms, including his tempered desperation give it an edge that keeps you tuned in.",A Most Violent Year
76,shawneofthedead,"Beautifully shot and exceptionally performed, but a little too slow and measured to really grab the heart.",6,5 February 2015,"It isn't often that directors of commercials make a successful transition to movie-making. Telling a story over two hours, you'd imagine, requires quite a different skill-set from selling a product in thirty seconds. But writer-director J.C. Chandor has pulled it off - not just once, but three times now. Like talky financial thriller Margin Call and taciturn man-at-sea drama All Is Lost, A Most Violent Year is a smart, confident film that dares to linger over its ideas and issues. It may not be his best effort - it's a little too languid and disengaging for that - but it certainly proves, once again, that Chandor can plumb the depths of his subjects and characters with charm and intelligence.At a time when crime is rampant in New York City, in its most statistically violent year yet, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) struggles to secure the future of his family and his heating oil business. He needs to secure a bank loan to finance a massive property deal, even as his trucks are repeatedly hijacked and his barrels of oil stolen for sale on the black market. Through it all, Abel tries to stick to his metaphorical guns - to be as honest and trustworthy as his difficult situation allows - although his competitors are out to get him and his own wife (Jessica Chastain) and attorney (Albert Brooks) advise him to fight violence with violence.Anyone looking at the title of the film as a promise will be confounded by A Most Violent Year, which unfolds at a most unhurried pace. There is plenty of violence (and corruption) surrounding Abel, but it hovers menacingly at the corner of the frame and seldom bursts through. Instead, Chandor places his characters in long, talky scenes in which they trade words rather than punches: Abel maintains his innocence in the face of District Attorney Lawrence (David Oyelowo), or pleads with a smarmy competitor (Alessandro Nivola) to save him from financial insolvency. It's why the film can be frustrating at times. The narrative beats are sparse, threaded through a running time that could easily be whittled down.Give in to the slow, measured spell Chandor is weaving, however, and you'll find that the film coils itself into a knot of simmering tension by the end. There's a palpable sense of dread and despair to many scenes, which play all the more quietly for the conspicuous lack of any musical cues whatsoever. The occasional bursts of action thrum with desperation: whether it's Abel tearing after and confronting a hijacker, or truck driver Julian (Elyes Gabel) whipping out a firearm to fend off another debilitating attack. But, stately and intelligent as A Most Violent Year may be, it can also be a somewhat disengaging experience. Chandor shoots it remarkably well, in shades of gloom and ochre, but the narrative occasionally drags. By the time a red-hot splash of violence really does explode across the frame, it feels almost empty: too pat and too contrived for a film like this one.The characters, too, never completely leap off the screen. That's through no fault of the actors involved - Isaac is fantastic as Abel, unearthing his morality and resolve in a world where it'd be far easier to operate with neither. But, without much more of a backstory than what we get in hints, Abel's stoicism often strays too close to the realm of naivety. Chastain's Anna is a fascinating creation, a mobster's daughter with a steely boldness embedded in her very DNA - but doesn't get enough screen time to make more of an impact.A Most Violent Year is haunted by the ghosts of several films. Chandor is evidently well-versed in the likes of The Godfather and Sidney Lumet's New York crime dramas (think Dog Day Afternoon), and he grounds these influences in a plot that would be perfectly at home in one of the Coen Brothers' treatises on the futility of human endeavour. The end result is very much its own entity, a determined exercise in mood rather than action. It may not be to everyone's tastes: some will adore its gentle heartbeat and menacingly slow pace; others might abhor it. But there's no denying that Chandor is one of the most interesting directors making feature films today.",A Most Violent Year
77,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Action film? Gangster film? Business ethics film!,8,12 August 2015,"The title implies a straight-up action film like ""The Departed""—which it's not, to the disappointment of many—and the poster suggests a late-breaking ""Godfather"" clone, which it kind of is. Oscar Isaacs certainly comes on like a young Pacino in the role of Abel Morales, an immigrant striver who's married the boss's daughter (Jessica Chastain, in vintage Armani) and taken over the family business—only it's fuel oil, not olive oil, and the setting is the grubby Greenpoint waterfront (a few miles upstream from Terry Malloy's ""North River""), not Little Italy. This solid, involving film is a genre all to itself—part old-school working-class epic, like ""They Drive by Night"" (1940; the one where Bogart and George Raft are truckers); there's a fabulous car/truck/subway chase reminiscent of ""The French Connection"" and some nice edgy scenes between Abel, who takes pride in taking ""the path that's most right,"" and his wife, Anna, who wants to call in her Family (with a capital F) to take care of the inventory shrinkage that's bleeding their business dry. (Seems like w/d J.E. Chandor was trying for a less dysfunctional version of the spats between Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence in ""American Hustle."") A subplot involving Abel's protégé, a Latino driver who panics when things get rough, seems a little stagy and contrived, and the film loses some momentum in the final scenes, but all in all ""A Most Violent Year"" is well worth watching. Great performances, lots of familiar jowly faces from ""Homicide,"" ""The Sopranos"" (see if you can spot Hesh as a bearded Brooklyn patriarch) and ""Boardwalk Empire""; great locations and gorgeous subway graffiti.",A Most Violent Year
78,troyputland,"Too much talk, not enough action.",7,5 July 2015,"For a film that's called A Most Violent Year, violence is sparse. 1981 was the year with the most recorded crime in The Big Apple. J.C. Chandor's focuses on a successfully wealthy businessman. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a leading competitor in the oil heating industry. Luck's on his side when a plot of land becomes available that, if bought, will make him a powerful man. Unfortunately for him, his company's being attacked from all angles. Robbers are stealing his goods, his salesmen are assaulted and a legal battle (or two) threaten to overthrow him completely. Isaac's a fine line between honest businessman and passive gangster, placing family as the most important thing in his life. Only a small glimpse of his three daughters is given, meaning the daddy role is ill conceived. Making up for that is the oblique relationship with his wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain). There's a few tricks up her sleeve. She's not all she seems. Her family background gives enough indication as to what she's capable of. The heartbreaking moments come from Game of Thrones star Elyes Gabel. Julian, one of Abel's drivers, breaks the law trying to defend himself. Repercussions are fatal and sentimental. Where A Most Violent Year falls short is in its lack of action. This can be viewed as a masterpiece from a scriptwriters point of view, or a lack of depth that sees Chandor barely scratch the surface of the most violent year in New York's history.",A Most Violent Year
79,mgd_m,Supercool,8,2 May 2019,"I give 8 stars for this - that by the current Imdb standards counts as a 10. It's the second movie I watched by Chandor, and the second hit (the other being Margin Call). Chandor has a killer istinct for clichés, he takes one and then works it from the inside making a piece of art out of it. He goes for the core reality of those tropes (actual or perceived) and then slaps it in your face with intense, essential dialogues, real-life language, straight situations, and deep characters. This was very apparent in A Most Violent Year, because right from the start it follows this double pattern: a super-idealized setting from 1981, and a modernized storytelling. Cinematography was outstanding, with beautiful yellows, washed-out colors and disturbingly dim lighting for the interiors - just like many movie from the eighties. The soundtrack was on par, with a simple, monotone and saddening theme, straight from the eighties as well. Casting Oscar Isaac was a stroke of genius, cause he's a dead ringer for Erik Estrada.
Now about the story itself, I would say that it's surprising and weird, though being very earthbound at the same time. It's someway... reverse-surprising, but I won't spoiler anything about it.",A Most Violent Year
80,christian94,Jessica & Oscar with a good script and directing by J.C.,8,29 January 2017,"Oscar Isaac in his prime here, fresh off leading role in Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) and before his sci-fi year with Ex Machina (2015) and Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015), delivers deadpan and conviction as a medium-size business owner faced with financial, fiscal, legal and physical trouble. He stars opposite Jessica Chastain, Oscar-nominated for The Help (2011) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012) who plays his wife which turns out to be the most complex and interesting character. Jessica had ""A Most Stellar Year"" with Interstellar (2014) and her riveting performance here. She did carry her lesser role in The Martian (2015) the next year, proving to be the sci-fi year for her as well.Isaac is a force as Abel Morales and the writing and directing builds characters and tension to a boiling denouement. He has good scenes with his wife, lawyer, employees, friends, competitors and law enforcement. He even acts a crucial scene in his native Spanish. However a deleted scene where his character scolds his oldest daughter off the road is perhaps even better than all the scenes actually left in the final cut. Make sure to look for it in the DVD/Blu-Ray.Jessica plays the tough Anna Morales and the script could have windows for her to overact, but she is mostly able to nuance her performance and keep it believable and engrossing. Her scenes with her husband are the best, but she manages to protect his and their interests in others.J.C. Chandor who was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Margin Call (2011) writes a compelling story with some strong dialogue. He directs his two leads and creates a mood of suspense and thrill as we feel for the characters their bonds, their struggles and their fate.A stunning crime drama that creeps on you and leaves you wanting more with a succulent last act. A lot of superb details in the script and a near flawless execution. Just shy of Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright power couple as the Underwoods in House of Cards (2013).",A Most Violent Year
81,luke-a-mcgowan,"Preachy, wannabe Coppola schmuck, I expected so much more",4,22 July 2015,"Well acted, well constructed and well scripted, if A Most Violent Year was even slightly fun to watch, it might've been one of the greatest films of all time.Oscar Isaac stars as Abel Morales, a super clean businessman trying to make it in the oil industry. Well maybe he's not clean (because the film paradoxically insists on proclaiming his innocence but at the same time there's stuff to hide) but he's certainly moral. He's a good guy. Really good. Like, beat you over the head with a big stick saying ""ABEL MORALES IS A GOOD GUY"". Seriously, his name is ""Morals"". JC Chandor's film gets very preachy very fast, whether its haranguing against revenge or showing you that only people who are honest get ahead. Abel's trucks are constantly plagued by armed robbers, who assault his drivers and steal his wares. When he finally captures one red-handed, for no reason he lets the man go without even extracting the information about his employer. Meanwhile, a poor worker who is beaten senseless in the film's opening becomes the film's antagonist for no reason other than wanting to defend himself. A DA becomes obsessed with catching tax fraud and the previously mentioned worker, whilst completely ignoring the armed robbers. All the while, Abel is too pathetic to even defend his children. Because he's clean, honest and moralistic. Got it? I know I've mentioned it a lot, but I'm being subtle compared to Chandor.Isaac and Chastain are both first class actors, with at least one terrific scene each. They're incredible to watch. Their family dynamic was convincing and powerful, especially a scene where the two deride each other over who brought more power to their marriage. I also enjoyed Albert Brooks and David Oyelowo's performances.The script jumps around a fair bit. There's a scene where one of Abel's men is assaulted and dumped out of town. It makes no sense and serves no purpose. The perpetrators are never identified, nor is their motive, since he had no truck to steal. It goes nowhere. But then there's the beautifully written fight scene between Anna and Abel. The film then screeches to a bizarre conclusion, after Abel seeks loans from hereto unknown characters who are apparently bad. We just have to take their word for it. Oyelowo's character then completely shifts gear to give the film a falsely optimistic ending. It left a rather nasty taste in my mouth, and I finished the film with a sneer on my face. A Most Violent Year is a preachy, wannabe Coppola film and I expected so much more considering the talent involved. Not even Isaac or Chastain could save this.",A Most Violent Year
82,trublu215,"A gritty, atmospheric throwback crime thriller with its cast in top form",9,2 January 2015,"A Most Violent Year marks J.C. Chandor's directorial return to form in this gritty thriller telling the tale of a man constantly pressured by the elements of his surroundings. Featuring an onslaught of phenomenal performances and a slow burning screenplay, A Most Violent Year rises on the list of the very best of 2014. The film tells the story of the Morales family as they struggle to maintain their business empire during 1981 New York City, which is statistically the city's most crime ridden year. The film follows Abel, played by Oscar Issac, an immigrant who started his home oil business from the ground up and essentially is living the American Dream. When hijackings begin to start happening, one of which turning violent, the NYPD begin to dig into his empire, setting off a chain reaction of events that threaten to destroy the life he worked so hard to build. The film is an interesting contrast between Abel the family man and Abel the business man. He is a man that isn't afraid to do the unthinkable if he is crossed, not because he is a gangster or a violent criminal but because he is protecting what he cares about and when push comes to shove, he is willing to do whatever it takes. The best parts of A Most Violent Year come from the scenes with Abel and Anna, played by Oscar Issac and Jessica Chastain. To start off, both of these actors deliver career best performances and make you feel every word their saying. This is definite kudos to Chandor. His ability to humanize his characters is impeccable and A Most Violent Year is a clear cut showcase of what he is capable of behind the camera. To Chandor, his actors are key, without them, this film could fall apart very easily with one false note. It feels as if Chandor wrote the screenplay for these two and it really pays off, especially for Jessica Chastain, who is unbelievably good playing a manipulative Shakespearean femme fatale. The supporting cast features David Oyelowo, Alessandro Nivola, and the great Albert Brooks and they are absolutely exceptional in this film. The screenplay, as I said above, is terrific. It is realistic and grounded in 1970s-esque grit, echoing back to films such as The Friends of Eddie Coyle, The French Connection and Serpico. This is a film that fits very nicely in between The French Connection and Serpico. It is not a film about an event or a chronicle of the most violent year in New York's history, it is about characters. It is a character driven film and those of you who are looking for something a bit more filling regarding entertainment value, you'll be sorely disappointed with this film. Despite it's title, there are very few scenes of violence but when there is violence, it is usually sudden and realistic and doesn't wallow in the actual act of violence, it analyzes the affects of the violence at hand. My only issue that I had with A Most Violent Year is the cinematography. Bradford Young is an amazing cinematographer and really does well behind the camera but I don't feel as though he captured the essence of 1981. The film is crisp, clean and very digitized considering the time period we're supposed to be set in. The colors are all there and the tones are perfect but it is just too crisp looking and doesn't allow us to truly experience Chandor's New York City. Despite the digital look, the film's colors are very cold and desolate, making New York look as if it were on its way to becoming a deserted wasteland. Overall, A Most Violent Year is a slow burning crime thriller that is seeping with great performances and a brilliant script. I highly recommend it.",A Most Violent Year
83,ghost_dog86,A Most Boring Month,4,28 January 2015,"Even though it felt like I was in the theater for a year when watching ""A Most Violent Year"", can anyone explain what was up with the title? This entire movie takes place in the span of a month, am I right? I've heard from other critics (who loved this film) that this title is justified because 1981 (the year this movie is set) was statistically the most violent year in New York City history. But even so, the plot takes place in one month of this most violent year. Was this meant to be ironic? Am I missing something? Or maybe I'm just putting too much emphasis on the title. OK then, allow me to move on and review the actual movie.""A Most Violent Year"" is a poorly lit drama, without much violenceor seasonal change. It centers around an immigrant who runs a large oil company in New York City, played by the brilliant Oscar Isaac. As he is on the verge of a business deal which would solidify his idea of the American Dream, his trucks begin to repeatedly get high-jacked. With that problem striking fear into his drivers and with the news of a possible indictment looming from the local DA, this man, who on face value seems like a nice guy, may be forced to become that gangster that he never wanted to be.Written and directed by JC Chandor (Margin Call, All Is Lost) one of the most ambitious writer/directors working today, and aside from Aaron Sorkin, may have the largest vocabulary in Hollywood, ""A Most Violent Year"" is dense as far as the dialogue is concerned; so dense that I wouldn't blame some viewers for becoming a bit confused as to what is actually happening within the plot at any given moment. But this isn't the problem.Yes, the performances here are excellent, but other than Oscar Isaac, nobody is given anything to do; and this is a supporting cast which includes Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo and Albert Brooks. And yes, there are a few poetically delivered, existential Chandor lines of dialogue and a few scenes of suspense. But even those (the one big chase sequence in particular) result in these anti-climatic resolutions that may leave you more than a little irritated with Chandor's decision making.Final Thought: Have you ever had an instance when watching a movie where you spot a bad piece of editing (a woman's hair is down in one shot and in the next shot it's up, even though it's supposedly two seconds later in the same scene) or have an epiphany concerning a gaping plot hole near the beginning of the film, and for the rest of it, no matter what happens in terms of the plot development, you've become so fixated on this ""distraction"" that you can't enjoy the film anymore? This title was my distraction. OK, seriously, as much as I would like to blame my disappointment in this highly anticipated film on that trivial aspect, the fact is that my rating of ""A Most Violent Year"" comes down to the fact that nothing much happens throughout, in way of entertainment.",A Most Violent Year

I too was in that industry from 1980 to 1985 in Southern New Jersey. The corruption given in this movie is mild, almost non existent by comparisson to the reality of the real oil business which includes, corrupt politics, under the table state contracts, organized crime involvement along and so on and so on, just to skim the criminal surface.

85,CleveMan66,"""A Most Violent Year"" is A Most Frustrating Experience.",3,30 January 2015,"When you're playing poker and you think you're holding cards that are better than the other players, you raise the stakes. Well, in the poker game that is movie awards season, releasing a movie at the very end of the year is a sign that a studio thinks it has a very strong film on its hands. They're betting that those who nominate films and actors for awards will agree. Often, the gamble pays off. Sometimes it doesn't. Such is the situation in which the producers of ""A Most Violent Year"" (R, 2:05) found themselves. The film received no Oscar nominations, one Golden Globe nomination and that's about it. There are a number of good reasons for the snubs, if you can call them that.The film centers around Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), the owner of a heating oil supply company in New York City in 1981, which happens to have been one of the worst years for violent crime in the city's history. Abel (pronounced ah-BELL) is dealing with a rash of hijackings of his trucks by unknown thugs who steal the oil and abandon the trucks. He's also trying to raise enough money to close on a neighboring property which will allow him to expand his business. Abel has used all of his company's available cash as a down payment and has 30 days to pay the balance or he loses his deposit. He's counting on his bank to loan him the rest of the money, but an investigation of his company's business practices by Assistant District Attorney Lawrence (David Oyelowo) and the ongoing problem of the fuel oil thefts is putting the entire future of his business in jeopardy.Abel has a lot on his plate and the people closest to him sometimes seem to be working against him. His wife (Jessica Chastain) berates Abel for not doing more to protect his family, especially after he chases off a would-be intruder from his front porch and doesn't seem to have a plan to deal with the situation when his youngest daughter finds the thug's gun in the bushes. The local Teamsters leader (Peter Gerety) insists that his drivers be allowed to arm themselves for self-defense. Abel objects, for fear of what that might lead to, but Abel's lawyer (Albert Brooks) sides with the Teamsters. The fact that Abel is a decent and honest man in such a tough business makes meeting all these challenges all the more difficult.""A Most Violent Year"" has a number of problems, starting with false advertising. The film's title and its theatrical trailer lead one to believe that this is a violent movie. Newscasts heard in the background of several scenes and a conversation or two remind us that this was a violent year for the city, but the movie is actually not very violent at all. Not only does all this misrepresent the film's story, but the movie's relative lack of violence seems counterintuitive when you think about what's going on in the story.The performances of Isaac and Chastain were excellent, but they are overshadowed by the ineptness of their characters, especially Isaac's. Abel is dangerously naïve regarding the seriousness of the situations he and his family face and maddeningly unable to do much about his problems. He dresses, talks and carries himself like he belongs in one of the ""Godfather"" films, but underneath it all, he comes across more like a castrated Michael Corleone. I'm all for seeing an underdog triumph in a movie, or seeing a character's honesty and hard work pay off, but Abel is the kind of guy who stubbornly insists on bringing a knife to a gun fight. How a man like Abel succeeded as long as he had when the movie began or how he might hope to survive in his kind of world is a mystery, almost as much of a mystery as how this film's producers thought it deserved to be taken seriously as an awards contender. Sorry, folks. It looks like what you're holding here is no better than a pair of twos, a pair for threes and a joker. For that hand, all you'll get from me is a ""C"".",A Most Violent Year

87,blakiepeterson,A Supremely Acted and Directed Crime Drama,7,22 May 2015,"Though it has been proved several times throughout our history that nice guys finish last, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is determined to be a good man and a successful business executive. But times are tough, and it's 1981 — the most crime-riddled year in New York's history. Take the first few minutes of the film, for instance. Just as he's making an important deal, one of his cargo drivers is severely beaten by some enemy henchmen who steal the truck. Abel wants to conduct his company as smoothly as possible (what businessman doesn't?), but fighting violence with violence seems to be the only answer to his problems as of late. Adding to the increasing difficulties is the District Attorney (David Oyelowo), who is certain that misconduct is plaguing the finances of the company.In his third feature as a director, J.C. Chandor pays homage to the neo-noirs of Brian De Palma and Sidney Lumet, mimicking their underlying ferociousness with unwavering detail regarding the human side of the crime world. His other features (""Margin Call"", ""All Is Lost""), unseen by me, were lauded by critics for their virtuosic filmmaking. ""Margin Call"", a fictional account of the financial crisis of 2008, was praised for its crackling dialogue and unwavering tension; ""All Is Lost"", a near-silent depiction of a shipwreck, gave Robert Redford the role of a lifetime and acted as a thriller without the flash of its peers.Three movies into his career, it's clear that Chandor doesn't want to be a director sidelined to a particular genre like Hitchcock. He wants to flow in-between different styles and moods, a Howard Hawks of the 2010s. ""A Most Violent Year"" is a top-notch crime drama, but not in the ways you might expect. It's not the story that compels us, not the dialogue, but the acting, the tone, the directing. The film is as atmospheric as the best of its kind can get. Like a prisoner buried alive in an underground catacomb, ""A Most Violent Year"" traps us in its yellowing, graffiti adorned world; even the good guys mesh with the bad. The sweet smell of success is much too difficult to pass by.I can't say that I was truly entertained by ""A Most Violent Year"" — rather than run alongside its all too rare intelligent characteristics, I instead appreciated them. But sometimes, appreciation can be just as powerful as entertainment itself. Chandor is supremely confident in his writing and his directing, giving us further reasoning as to why he is already becoming one of the best filmmakers of the decade. If we are ever bored with the film itself (which is a seldom concern), we aren't with Chandor, who gives every shot a great deal of grimy beauty and venomous snap.Matching Chandor's rising talents are Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, college classmates whose careers seem to be hitting their peaks at the exact same time; Chastain announced her presence to the world in 2011 with an impressive six movie run (including ""The Tree of Life"" and ""The Help""), and Isaac, coming out of nowhere, made himself an actor for the ages as the titular character in 2013's ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". ""A Most Violent Year"" finds them at the top of their respective games. Isaac jumps from unyielding to exposed, from weak to authoritative, at a constant pace, providing for one of the finest performances of 2015. Chastain, dawning a look only matched by Elvira Hancock, commands every scene she's in as the person keeping Standard Oil afloat as her husband refuses to corrupt himself and his company. ""A Most Violent Year"" is an unbelievably well-directed and well-acted film, but missing is its ability to compel. Though never boring, the atmosphere is more gritty than it is truly tense, and there are a few too many characters that show up with interesting pieces of dialogue but never do much else. No matter: Chandor, in a short time, has revealed himself to be a decade defining filmmaker.",A Most Violent Year

90,adrian-43767,"Waste of Chastain's talent, pointless film",4,19 March 2018,"Frankly, I do not understand how any producer could finance such a pointless film, or how a director could do so little to improve what must have been a poor script to start off with. For one thing, the single most magnetic performer, Chastain, disappears from the film for long spells, and apart from unhesitatingly shooting dead a wounded deer, she makes no significant contribution in terms of character or deeds, and unexpectedly as well as needlessly, uses bad language with a cop, which is not a wise thing to do, especially if that cop produces a warrant to search your house.The most baffling thing of all is, however, the constant attention given to Oscar Isaac, a very limited actor who plays a kind of latter day Hamlet unable to take action against whoever keeps attacking his trucks and stealing his fuel, until he has no option but resort to his own bit of violence. He is obviously a good looking man, or he would not have been the lead to the stunningly beautiful Chastain, but his acting lets him down, and he is not helped by his unremittingly pure character, which is hardly credible under the circumstances. Ultimately, I found his character exhasperating. And then there is the totally pointless re-appearance of one of his drivers who had been the target of attacks, and been absent from the film for a considerable while after apparently succeeding in eluding police, only to blow his own brains out when he could have whacked Isaac. As if that idiocy were not bad enough, in the process he puts a hole through one of Isaac's fuel tanks, and the latter duly tried to block the leak with a useless piece of cloth.Hmmm...Soundtrack, direction, photography all mediocre.

94,lucasversantvoort,A wonderfully old-fashioned crime thriller,7,5 May 2015,"A Most Violent Year is a crime drama injected with a hearty dose of moral ambiguity. The film's sole interest is exploring the conflict between walking the easy (but wrong) path and the straight and narrow path and where these two intertwine. It's not for nothing the film takes place in New York in '81, which apparently was the city's most violent year.Abel Morales (not exactly the subtlest symbolic name I've ever come across) is a businessman running an oil company. He tries to purchase an important piece of land from some Jews, land that will give him a considerable financial advantage over his competitors. He pays about half in advance and promises to pay the rest in a month. However, soon after, some of his drivers start being attacked and having their trucks stolen. Abel realizes one or more of his mobbed up competitors are putting the screws on him and trying to run him out. Not only that, but the local assistant district attorney also announces he'll dig into his company's history to find any indication of wrongdoing. It all gets worse and Abel finds his morals tested more and more. Nevertheless, he constantly strives to resolve any problem in the most righteous way possible.When the guy's last name is Morales, it's obviously referencing the film's moral ambiguity. So naturally you start to wonder whether Abel is a reference to Cain and Abel. The key thing is that Cain owned land and built cities, while Abel wandered, owning nothing. By that reasoning, it's interesting to note the film's central conflict centers around Abel's decision to buy land, precisely what doesn't define the classic Abel. Consequently, the Cains of the world attack him. Because Abel isn't traditionally used to owning land, he's out of his element and finds his morality tested.The film's title is wonderfully suggestive, precisely because there really isn't a lot of violence in it. It takes me back to PTA's There Will Be Blood which of course featured pretty much no blood. A Most Violent Year does have violence, but it's framed by the fancy lifestyle enjoyed by Abel and his competitors as contrasted with the people who work for him. Even the use of the word 'most' in the title is wonderful, because it's a fancy word, symbolizing Abel's desire to remain 'clean' in an inherently 'dirty' world.The real highlight is Abel's struggle to do precisely that. Even when his workers are abused, he refuses to provide them with handguns, sensing it would only escalate matters. No, Abel seeks to run a normal business no matter the cost. Everything proceeds to what appears to be an anticlimax, but is actually a wonderfully ambiguous ending. As the credits roll meanderingly, you're left pondering whether or not Abel did indeed walk the 'right path' or if he was desperately trying to rationalize everything, being too afraid to face the possibility of being guilty of wrongdoing. It's not a typical crime thriller, but definitely for those of us who can handle morally grey areas and unresolved questions.",A Most Violent Year

Chandor (director) is like Shyamalan in the crime drama department. This movie just moved soooo slow. It seemed to have a 10 hour run time. This movie dragged bigtime. I didn't care about any of the characters, and felt zero suspense/drama thru out the film.This movie reminds me of the horror movie ""The Blair Witch Project"". In that movie, you kept thinking something was going to happen to the characters, but very little does. This movie is the same way, very little action/violence occur. (though you keep expecting that it will pick up) When it does occur, its done so poorly you just don't care. At least Blair Witch Project was loaded with suspense (on the first viewing, it doesn't hold up well on subsequent viewings after knowing what happens).People will get reeled in to watch this movie because of the title (I did).

96,rjsf96,A Most Compelling Film,9,30 January 2015,"New York. 1981. The Big Apple drenched with a sickly green tinge. The crime rate is sky high. Murder, rape; you name it. This world is no longer the safe haven it once was. Our protagonist is Abel Morales played with total role commitment by Oscar Isaac. He tells us that ""I spent my whole life trying not to be a gangster"". An Anti -'Goodfellas' if you will. Morales must maintain his oil company. But that is becoming increasingly harder to do as crime reaches its peak and the police are weaker. He has to find new means of transporting his goods or will be faced with life or death consequences. His reputation is far from the only thing on the line.What makes 'A Most Violent Year' work so well is its ability to thrill viewers, even if the title is somewhat misleading. There are dashes of murder here and there by nothing overtly violent. It pulls the viewer in, into its world of crime, deceit and death. This is largely due to its two stars Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. It's like they were always destined to be an on screen duo. You buy that they are in love, that they are a couple, that they will do what is necessary to stay alive.Isaac brings sophistication, confidence and ferocity to his character and fully immerses himself within it; a role completely different to that of 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. He relishes every second that he is in frame and is vastly becoming my favourite actor working today. If he engages in roles similar to the past few then there is no stopping his character defining roles. It is not hard to imagine him as a certain double o agent.Chastain likewise impresses as Anna; a role that I had dismissed and was wrong to do so. She challenges anyone she sees as a potential threat even if it is her husband. Strong willed and minded; she knows better than anyone the danger of NY City. This is reflected perfectly in a scene where she discovers her daughter has possession of a handgun. She is shocked and her resolve hardens.The script by J. C. Chandor who also directed the picture, completely understands character development and its importance in shaping otherwise forgettable cardboard cut-outs into life like people we care about as if we have known them our entire life. Engaging and multi layered character interplay is the key of a film such as this, that centres on many different characters with their own individual traits.It goes without saying that these are some of the best characters from 2014; developed so well, that in fact I could watch them all day. They seem to leap off of the screen and inhabit characteristics that are not bound by the normal conventions of film and scriptwriting. It is a crime that this film was forgotten about at the Oscars and not just the performances and the script are perfection.When you praise a film for its cinematography and many others, people mistake the praise for blandness. Not here. I have not seen a more sublime picture since 'Boyhood', consider that high praise indeed. Every shot is punctuated by cool blues and ugly greens bordering on illness. The composition is exquisite and carried out with precise attention to detail. How the Academy overlooked this factor is beyond me.It can be that little elements in the film make it all the better and this is certainly the case here. The eighties as a time period works wonders and you can tell that the production team had fun. Everything from the art décor to the music has a historic feel to it and makes the film all the more unique.Furthermore, the ominous music builds up as the tension increases; making it difficult for the fittest audience member to draw breath. Little factors such as these reap rewards for avid film-goers and no doubt will make the film even more majestic on repeat viewings.A final factor that would be murder not to state is the editing. Low-key for the most part, later in the film it draws attention to itself and in one of the most impactful scenes. Two oil truck drivers are given separate jobs. We see them simultaneously and flit between the two. It becomes clear that matters are about to get bloody and I could not tear my eyes away from the screen. I have not seen editing as great as this since the baptism scene in 'The Godfather'.It is slightly disappointing that the film can be too meandering at times. I feel that fifteen minutes would have tightened the picture and made it more impressive. But this is a minor flaw in an otherwise flawless film.'A Most Violent Year delivers and splendidly. The film may not be for everyone, the impatient in particular. But for fans of intriguing storytelling, screen-defying characters and killer cinematography it most certainly is. I for one cannot wait to see what film J. C. Chandor works magic with next.",A Most Violent Year

The monotony is occasionally broken up by the film's only saving grace - the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain, who shine in their scenes together. Unfortunately, they are too few and far between, and this insipid drama shows just how little it has to say about any of the themes it touches on but makes no effort to try and explore.

Oscar Isaac, who was quite likable in Inside Llewyn Davis and even stronger here, does a fine job as Abel Morales, head of a New York City heating oil company; Jessica Chastain, always good, plays his wife. Morales's trucks are being hijacked and his drivers beaten up by—who?—shady competitors, ambitious freelancers, organized crime? With his drivers and sales people at risk, the default of everyone around him is to arm themselves (which makes for some pretty scary scenarios in city traffic), but Morales resists. He wants to remain an upstanding businessman, to keep taking the high road despite the growing chaos around him. This includes a lengthy and apparently stalled investigation by the city prosecutor (David Oyelowo) of financial sins in the heating oil industry and Morales's company in particular. Morales is aided in his endeavors by the somewhat ambiguous character of his lawyer (Albert Brooks) who has the patience for long negotiations. As one protracted land acquisition looks about to successfully conclude, the other difficulties piling up put it out of reach again. What was solid about this movie was that the business dealings seemed plausible and important, not just made up in the usual Hollywood way. The film was written and directed by J. C. Chandor, and in our cynical epoch of anti-heroes, he's made Morales someone you want to see succeed. ""There's less violence that you would expect, given the film's title, but the scenes of moral suspense prove just as breathtaking as the episodes of physical jeopardy,"" said Jason Best in Movie Talk. The plot took unexpected turns until the final resolution, and, whatever, viewers have many chances to see the most beautiful (and magically dirt-shedding) camel-hair coat ever!

And I utterly felt bad for one of the characters, about as tragic as it gets for this one particular character, but you'll have to see it to know. All the acting is outstanding from Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain, but I will admit I was annoyed by Chastain's character as she acted like such a hardcore individual that she came across as dumb sometimes, but she make up for it later on.

Throw in Oscar Issac, Jessica Chastain and David Oyelowo and it kicks your anticipation into high gear. That's why when the credits are rolling you feel incredibly duped and want the last two hours and five minutes of your life back!The premise? Abel Morales (Issac) is the owner of an up-and-coming heating oil company in NYC 1991, which has recently suffered the hijacking of several trucks. One driver, Julian (Elyes Gabel) is severely beaten by one of the hijackers. Abel's wife, Anna (Chastain) implores him to fight violence with violence, but he refuses. The head of the local Teamsters tells him to arm his driver's with guns for protection, but he again refuses. In addition, Abel is seeking to expand his business by purchasing a fuel oil terminal on the East River but is having a problem obtaining financing for the $1.5M deal. And somewhere in this convoluted mess is Assistant District Attorney Lawrence (Oyelowo) who is going after the entire local heating oil business for price fixing, tax evasion, etc. If my summation was disjointed, I completely agree ~ as disjointed as this movie was. Aside from Julian having a shootout in the middle of the Queensboro Bridge in the middle of the day (no...really), and Abel punching a hijacker he caught up to after a foot chase, that was about as violent as 'A Most Violent Year' ever got. Gave the movie a generous 3* out of 10...probably because I felt sorry that these great actors were wasted on this 2014 stinker.",A Most Violent Year

Wink.Oxymoronic also considering it's an independent film and a period piece.Elaborately set during the winter of 1981; it doesn't feel very 'independent.'It stands at $4.6M in the box office, according to Box Office Mojo and Rotten Tomatoes; a tragedy considering it's $20M production budget.This may be a reflection of late distribution, finally releasing wide in theaters on January 30.Which is intrinsically tied to its complete lack of Oscar nominations.A gosh-darn-shame, considering the filmmaker's credentials.As the scholars say, J. C. Chandor is an 'auteur.'Which Google defines as, ""A filmmaker whose personal influence and artistic control over a movie are so great that the filmmaker is regarded as the author of the movie.""A less frilly description is writer/director.J. C.'s crafted three flicks thus far, including 2011's Margin Call and 2013's All Is Lost.Both were critically well-received, and particularly the former contains my stamp of approval.In a way, he's comparable to Woody Allen; relying less on elaborate cinematic sequences or stylistic editing, and focusing heavily on story and strong acting.'Great movies for adults' is another way to say it.A Most Violent Year's no different.The cast is phenomenal.Oscar Isaac (of Inside Llewyn Davis fame) is fantastic in the leading role.Albert Brooks is excellent, but did you expect anything less?No; of course not. The man's a master of his craft.Another master, Jessica Chastain, delivers a remarkable performance.The word 'snub' is overly bandied about.But if Laura Dern's five minutes of Wild screen time total up to a Best Supporting Actress nomination, one can easily argue Chastain deserves it more.All in all, A Most Violent Year hasn't received the credit it deserves.It's written well, full of strong performances and compelling throughout.Catch it in theaters while you still have the chance!",A Most Violent Year

109,Mustang92,Meh,5,1 January 2015,"The Good (or semi-good): Strong acting. Jessica Chastain is a joy to watch here, and you will be left feeling she didn't have enough to do in this story. And you are right. She doesn't. The script/story doesn't give her this, she's just a supporting character. Too bad. Oscar Isaac is good too, but he's hampered by this story to show his range. (At least I think he's got a range.) He plays most everything in a very understated way.The Bad: Unsatisfying script/story. This is mostly a ""talking heads"" movie. Nothing wrong with that, I like those. This doesn't have to be ""The Equalizer,"" nor should it be. But there really isn't any arc to any of the characters here. There's no emotional arc, they are precisely the same at the end, as they are at the beginning. And because the obstacles our hero faces are all handled by what amounts to ""conference room negotiations,"" it's a bit boring. (Like when the bank loan fails to come through, he round of meetings with his competitors to get the money he needs is a snooze-fest.)I think the problem today with a lot of writer/directors, is that they don't know how to structure and create a story that will actually deliver an experience for the viewer. Even a good ""talking heads"" movie -- if well written -- will have characters at the end that have gone through something, that the audience gets to experience. ""A Most Violent Year"" doesn't do this. And in fact, I had a feeling the title would be misleading, before even going to see this movie. (There's virtually no violence in the movie.) Not that I needed this, but... this film definitely needed something more.Incidentally, of the 2 action sequences in the film, they both fail. The one with the driver defending himself as he's about to be hijacked: After defending himself and the cops begin arriving, he runs, leaving his oil truck. Runs? Why?? This is 1981. He was simply defending himself, and the worst that would have happened is that he gets probation for possession and firing a gun. No one was hurt/killed. And it was self-defense! This ""little"" story point, ends up causing other things to happen, like our hero not getting his loan from the bank. (Huh? Seriously?? I don't buy that.) Which leads to other things, and eventually to the driver committing suicide. WTF? Okay, I know people commit suicide for many, many reasons. But this has got to be one of the most ludicrous reasons, and it's simply not believable.Additionally, the drivers are supposedly Teamsters. And one of the basic story points here is our hero's trucks (driven by Teamsters) are constantly getting hijacked. Unless there was a point in time where this actually happened regularly, it's kind of a difficult story point to swallow, because the Teamsters were notoriously linked with the Mob. And no one could regularly steal from the Mob and get away with it, and the Teamsters wouldn't permit their drivers to continuously be hijacked.The Ugly: Color timing. It is so muted and depressed, ostensibly to reflect and add to the depressed nature of our hero's struggles, that it's not the most ""pleasing-on-the- eye"" movie. I don't know why so many directors think that muting colors and making their film look somewhat dingy, is appropriate so often. It's dumb. Sure, sometimes it's appropriate, David Fincher loves to do this on some of his films. But I see it way too much nowadays, and often it just doesn't work. (Case in point: Look at all the films Scorsese has done, many that are gritty or dark. The color timing never ventures into the ""ugly"" territory.)Bottom Line:I didn't hate this movie, but it was very unsatisfying. I think with a better script, and giving Jessica Chastain more to do, and allowing Oscar Isaac to ""fly"" a little, it could have been a much better movie.",A Most Violent Year
110,sickofenjoyingmyself,Thoughtful Drama,7,11 September 2016,"'A most violent year' is an extremely thoughtful and measured drama. It isn't remotely violent and instead depicts a self made businessman who is trying to remain calm and make reasonable business decisions in the midst of a particularly violent period in recent NYC history. There are shades of gangster movie sentiments - where Abel wants to make his business legitimate (or seem legitimate). The lack of violence actually engages us in a greater human story about a man with the will to succeed at any costs. A man with vision, self- belief and measured decisions. Behind him is a wife with equal vision and more cunning. What makes the story work is some great acting. Oscar Isaac is very believable and extremely controlled. Jessica Chastain is unpredictable. Albert Brooks seemed too confined in his role but I always enjoy watching him as an actor. I also felt that David Oyelowo was underused and an intriguing story line could have been developed between his character and Abel. They never really came to a head. Overall I really enjoyed it and thought it was intelligent and thoughtful.",A Most Violent Year
111,jkbonner1,More to it than meets the eye (watch carefully),9,16 February 2015,"This movie's a whodunit but the ""who"" isn't a murderer that needs to be apprehended but rather someone trying to put a competitor out of business. That competitor is Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac). Morales has clawed his way up and out of an immigrant neighborhood (presumably Puerto Rican), climbing the ladder of success selling heating oil in the New York-northern New Jersey marketplace where the heating-oil delivery business is dominated by about a dozen big shots, all of whom are teetering on the blurry line separating the legal from the illegal. It didn't hurt that along the way he married the boss's daughter, Anna (Jessica Chastain), whose father was in the same business (we're told he has a bad reputation).It's 1981 but times are tough, 1981 becoming one of the most violent years in New York history. And Morales isn't spared his share of violence. He's poised to complete a real estate transaction buying a storage tank yard having direct access to overseas shipping. This purchase would shoot him right up to the very top, so he's positioning himself to dominate the heating oil business. The price is 2 million (about $5,500,000 today). He puts up $500,000 and has to come up with the remaining 1.5 million or the deal falls through and he loses all his earnest money. But someone has been ordering two armed thugs to hijack his tanker trucks at gunpoint, siphon off the oil, and sell it to his competitors. And to make things worse, Morales is also having trouble with the special adjunct District Attorney (David Oyelowo), who's preparing an indictment against him.Throughout the entire movie Morales asserts his honesty over and over. He insists someone is screwing with him, trying to put him out of business. His drivers are being intimidated by the two thugs. He has the Teamster trucking boss (Peter Gerety) call all the big shots to a meeting. There he tells them pointblank one of them is behind it all. They all proclaim their innocence. ""Stop,"" he says to them emphatically, ""just stop."" Then he marches out, his indignation practically falling off his shoulders and smashing the floor with a resounding thud.Due to all the bad publicity his banker, Arthur Lewis (John Procaccino), tells Morales he can't advance him the 1.5 million to complete the storage tank yard purchase even though he assured Morales he would at dinner the night before. Panicking, Morales pleads with the seller, Josef (Jerry Adler), to give him more time to pull the deal through. He gets three days, pulling together the 1.5 million from diverse sources, including $600,000 embezzled by his wife from their own company for a rainy day. He's furious at her―after all, he's impeccably honest, remember?―but this is the proverbial rainy day if there ever was one. The purchase goes through and he, his wife, and his counselor (Albert Brooks), stand around admiring the new purchase when one of his drivers, Julian (Elyes Gabel), whom he's fired shows up waving a gun and starts berating him. Morales approaches him and they talk in whispers. Morales promises Julian he'll take care of Julian's family. I won't reveal the ending but it is climactic.So who's the who in whodunit? If I knew, I wouldn't tell, but I don't. I can think of several people as possibilities. I only watched the movie once, and probably missed several important clues. But keep your eye carefully focused on Julian. That's all I'll say.Not only a crackerjack whodunit but also an adequate action movie with a great car/truck chase. There are a few loose ends but the acting is great. This is the director's (J.C. Chandor) third movie in four years. It turns out I saw his first two movies when they came out, Margin Call (2011) and All is Lost (2013), but I didn't know he had also directed them until I watched A Most Violent Year. All three movies are outstanding each in its own way (All is Lost is totally unique), and I strongly recommend each of them. I'm looking forward with anticipation to his next film.Sit back and enjoy and see whom you come up with for the who.9/10",A Most Violent Year
112,don2507,A Hollywood Movie That Focuses On An Honest Businessman!,8,27 February 2018,"To me at least, this engrossing film is much more about an independent businessman facing huge hurdles in a (very) tough industry, than it is the crime drama that critics allude to. Indeed, its (mistitled) title, based on other reviews on this site, apparently attracted some violence-aficionados who were expecting a mob film with wise guys decapitating each other, and were thus sorely disappointed. I can't remember many (any?) Hollywood films where the central character is a businessman who is portrayed as honest, decent, wise, and with an intuitive knowledge of human nature, and that frankly makes the film interesting to me. Abel Morales (as portrayed by Oscar Isaac) is the businessman in the film. He's a well-spoken, self-controlled immigrant businessman who's doing reasonably well in the NYC heating oil business, but in the film he plans a major expansion of his capacity by purchasing a fuel oil terminal on the East River. He has 30 days to secure the financing for the acquisition but he's beset by either rivals or freelancers who hijack his fuel trucks and sell his oil, plus an ambitious Assistant DA who's investigating price-rigging and tax evasion in the heating oil business who seems to be (unfairly) targeting Morales. One thing leads to another, allowing his bank to drop his financing, and he's forced to locate other sources of funding in the few days he has left to close the deal. Maybe these business issues don't do anything for you, but the characterization of Morales and his desire to do the right thing made me root for him. His wife, the daughter of a mobster, urges him to fight violence with violence to which he refuses. He even throws her gun away that she purchased for protection. Yes, there's criminal activity in this film (e.g., the hijackings) but it's essentially about an honest man trying to stay on the right side of the law operating in a cut-throat business who has a major investment that will either make him or break him. Eight stars for a rare portrayal of a businessmen struggling to overcome all sorts of obstacles.",A Most Violent Year
113,rddj05,Really Well-Made Film. Not for the Fast n' Furious Crowd,8,17 September 2015,"Once again, Chandor gives us a well-written, well-acted, beautifully photographed film, on a relatively small budget, that winds up being incredibly watchable. I would say he's done this with all 3 of his films. None of them were action-packed film, but that all had a truth and reality to them, that really pulled me in.I've read some reviews on here that complain that the film was too slow for them or that it was ""boring."" Look, despite it's title (which may have mislead a lot of viewers going in), this film is not for the Fast and Furious or Transformers crowd. It's not even for people who loved the blood-soaked Scarface. It portrays violence and the fear of running a business in NYC in the early 80s, in a very real way. And it captures the early 80s look flawlessly. This film may, however, be be for people who loved films like The Godfather or DePalma's Dressed to Kill. Not only does Oscar Issac seem to channel bits of Michael Corleone, but the film is lit and photographed in a very similar manner to the way that Gordon Willis shot The Godfather. Also, for those who think there was a ton of action and killing in the Godfather, outside of the final few minutes, there really isn't. Though very different films, what pulls you into the Godfather and Dressed to Kill is similar to what pulls you in here. Tension, honesty, a simple story, well told. No BS. No shooting up a whole town, with dead bodies falling everywhere, and then cutting to the next scene at dinner. In real life, violence is frightening, finding a gun is frightening, shooting a gun at someone is frightening, having your life savings at stake, and the fear of losing everything you've worked for is frightening. Chandor pulls this all together to build tension, and it results in a very satisfying film.",A Most Violent Year

115,CharlieGreenCG,Bonnie and Clyde - but without the violence.,9,15 January 2015,"It's winter of 1981, statistically the most violent year in New York City's history. Based on that time period, the film, A Most Violent Year, centres on the lives of Abel (Isaac) and Anna Morales (Chastain) as they try to expand their business and capitalise on opportunities. Yet, through the rampant violence, decay and corruption of that year, they slowly become involved as it threatens to destroy all they have built.Rape, stealing and murder are frequent broadcasts over the overly- large car radios. Which, to the excessive-downfall of Abel - who is trying to achieve the American Dream through legitimate means - is forced into situations that are not so legal, as his oil empire is under threat by harrowing competitors. That, plus the ambitious district attorney (David Oyelowo) is sniffing around with hopes of bringing him to jail.It's tense. But writer, director, J. C Chandor's true genius however, is that he establishes a contrasts between an anti-gangster character in an overly-gangster environment. It explores the expected thuggish behaviours, yet with minimal gunfire, car-chases and explosions. Instead of the loud violence, A Most Violent Year focuses on silent territorial wars and atmospheric dealings, which slowly drag Abel into the law enforcement radar.Through the dark underworld of maddening violence, Oscar Isaac's humble-seeming business mogul is not presented as either a hero, or an anti-hero - just a man who is trying to protect what he has. But, whilst Isaac is not physically intimidating – his class and approach to the situations make him much bigger than his enemies. It strongly echoes tones of Michael Corleone in both theme and expressionless monologue; likewise, his distance from crime is tested as his moral compass is slips.Courtesy of Alex Ebert, the film's orchestral score even sounds like something suited for the Corleone family. Visually, it does too, as renowned cinematographer, Bradford Young, captures the iconic palette of mono-tones, dim-lit rooms and 80's city vistas.Jessica Chastain continues her already strong acting streak, as she plays Abel's wife. A pragmatic woman, who displays a Macbeth-esqe hold over him: controlling and manipulating his ideals into illegally inclined methods of success. It's like Bonnie and Clyde, but without the violence.Like Scorsese does, Chandor manages to craft a gritty juxtaposition between crime and survival during an earlier set period. It's like The Godfather, French Connection and various other mafia ventures - smart over loud - and an instant classic.",A Most Violent Year

The film is a character driven story of survival of a an executive ala Michael Clayton.This should be made clear to the viewer and there's no relation to the statistically most violent year. This may have been the reason for its failure. Secondly, the story is wafer thin and two hours is too long a time for very little or more of the same thing.Opportunities where the plot could be made more involved or complex are lost.The movie had to retain a sense of dread like Michael Clayton but is unable to hold the attention despite the impressive first 20 minutes. Thirdly, the some story lines did not fit the tone of the movie.The overlong chase by Abel to track the van driver felt like it belonged to a Bond or Bourne movie.Suddenly, our hero is transformed from an ordinary man to something else! Lastly, the suicide in the end does not add anything to the story and simply adds some vague angle to the story. It's an above average movie but basically a missed opportunity!!",A Most Violent Year
118,raiderhayseed,"A Most Non Violent, Righteous Year",8,1 March 2015,"I did not enjoy J.C. Chandor's film, ""Margin Call"".It depicted the grubby actions of rich bankers, scuttling like cockroaches in the scullery, to protect their often ill-gotten gains from their own injudicious financing policies. Their very determination to protect their personal fortunes at all costs made them unsympathetic characters.He has reworked the formula in ""A Most Violent Year"", by providing us with a moral, but by no means financially disinterested hero, with whom we can identify. The bankers are still an unreliable lot who should be avoided wherever possible, fulfilling that old definition as people who beg you to take their money when you don't need it, and demand it back when you do.It is almost as if Chandor has reworked the film ""Godfather II"" It is almost as if he has reversed the roles of Al Pacino (Michael) and Diane Keaton (Kay). As if he has made Michael Corleone the moral one and his wife, Kay, the amoral one. In ""A Most Violent Year"", self made heating oil supplier, Oscar Isaac (Abel Morales) manifests a lot of the Al Pacino mannerisms while rejecting the 'Corleone family"" way of doing things.His 'daughter of a New Jersey gangster' wife, Anna Morales (Jessica Chastain) sees no real problem with that mindset.Oscar Isaac brings great screen presence to his portrayal of a man with a determination to succeed in business following a moral compass that justifies his faith in the way the capitalist system can be made to work. But there are some intriguing paradoxes that raise questions about the ability of a just man to withstand the forces of corruption when running a business.He refuses to allow his truck drivers to carry guns to act as a deterrent to the hijackers who are draining his resources. But it the actions of the driver who disobeys his directive that brings to light the 'injustice"" of the actions of the 'justice system' that is failing ignominiously in its conduct of its duty to enforce justice. A public gun fight deprives the district attorney's slow and misdirected investigatory process of the anonymity that amounts to persecuting a man who is seeking to act in a just mannerHe uses a gun (as a blunt instrument rather than a fire arm) when he comes face to face with the independent hijacker who has been preying on his drivers. In other words, he conforms to the need to use tempered brute force to combat brute force. But to be fair, he has the self control to use restraint rather than violence to attain his goals. He presents the incriminating evidence to the business competitor who has been purchasing the oil hijacked from his trucks and threatens him with exposure to the judicial authorities if he does not repay him for the losses incurredHe uses his net working skills and access to the criminal underworld as a lender of last resort when faced with financial ruin He refuses to accept the 'standard industry practice' way of doing business. But it the actions of a person who has been following those corrupt business practices, the very actions the judicial bureaucracy is investigating, that saves him from becoming a servant of the criminal underworld who have the money that is necessary to run a business when the banks withdraw their support But director Chandor has created a character with whom we can celebrate the ultimate success of a righteous man when he finally triumphs over the forces of evil and stupidity that beset him. That makes for a satisfying, stimulating and rewarding cinematic experience. And the added bonus is some continuing food for thought as to the way things happen in the real world. Maybe even the way in which sometimes, to quote from the redemption seeking hit man,Jules, in ""Pulp Fiction""""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children....",A Most Violent Year
119,oscarxp25,The Best film of 2014!,10,10 February 2015,"What is surprising about ""A Most Violent Year"" is that is absent from the seven nominees for Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards. It is a shocker because whomever wins the award for best film at The National Board of Review usually wins best picture at the Academy Awards or at least scores a nomination. This film failed to do so on both accounts. The question is why? Is it boring? Did the Academy think that the themes of corruption, crime, and business, all set in the dangerous times of New York City in the 80's, wouldn't resonate with today's public? It would be interesting to hear why they didn't grant it an nomination because it is truly a magnificent picture.Oscar Issac stars as Abel Morales, a business man who owns a oil company, who has finally reaches the big time. His wife, Anna Morales, played by the ever so beautiful and reliable Jessica Chastain, is right by his side to celebrate everything that he has earned. Since the film takes place in New York City, during the 1980's, which was far from the safe and beautiful place it is today, crime is rampant. One of his trucks, which is carrying 6,000 gallons of fuel is stolen. At first, it seems like a one time thing but as the movie progresses, more and more bad circumstances start to happen to Abel's company and personal life. All the awhile Lawrence, who works for the police department, is investigating all his numbers since half the businesses around the city have ripped people off. Abel tries to deal with this like a gentleman, but Anna will do anything to stay afloat and constantly criticizes his manhood for not taking charge and going full force on those who are threatening both his business and family. Can good old fashioned decency even exist in business, especially during this time?Oscar Issac carries this film effortlessly. Abel struggles with doing what is right and what has to be done throughout the entire film. Issac shows this struggle through every grimace, frown, and wrinkled eyebrow. It is a quiet performance but shouldn't be overlooked like it unfairly has been. J.C. Candor, who wrote and directed the film, gives so many poignant and suave lines to Abel. This is a man who you can tell has truly worked for what he has earned, he wasn't given it. Many of the scenes are him conversing and cutting deals with the people around him. Many movie goers love the gun shots and violence of crime dramas, which this film does have, but that life isn't all about those choices. Characters like Abel are smarter and above those choices. His motto is that the best way to stay unnoticed is not to make noise. That motto is not shared by his wife who is played by Chastain. This is an actress who is becoming more and more better with each role she plays. I like to keep the word ""I"" out of my reviews but I think she really is the next Meryl Streep. Every role she takes on she knocks out of the park. Here, she is cunning, sly, and fierce. Yes, she did have the fierceness in 2012's ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but here she seems more frightening. Chastain plays Anna like a lioness protecting her cubs. She is incredibly believable as a east coast mafia girl. The accent, the temper, the guilt, the sex appeal..she has it all here. It is an amazing performance that adds even more to the level that Issac reaches. Both of these actors attended the famous acting school Julliard together and, it has been said, that they dreamed of working together one day. Well, they got their wish and the results are out of this world. Let's hope they do this again with the level of skill they achieve here. The performances are worth the price of admission.J.C. Chandor's last feature, ""All is Lost"", was about a man, played by Robert Redford stranded at sea. The film was Redford all by himself for the entire length of the film fighting to survive. The film divided the people. Some thought it was boring, while others thought it was brilliant. Chandor likes to to tell his time with his storytelling so those of you who are allergic to a slow building story should stay clear of this film. For those who don't mind these kind of films know that films like these usually reward patience. A car chase in the film is thrilling and well shot. Another scene shows a truck driver running for his life from the police and those who are trying to harm him. The foot chase is beautiful staged and perfectly photographed. The cinematography is simple, but adds so much to the straightforwardness of the story. The colors are very basic which adds to the the vintage style it achieves in capturing. In moments where the thrills come through the dialogue driven scenes, Alex Ebert's haunting score heightens the intensity of those scenes even more. It is an all around masterpiece in film making that is captained by Chandor. There is so much morality in this film that Chandor brings out through his direction and masterfully written script.""A Most Violent Year"" has been unfairly forgotten by the most award circuit. Many people who go to the movies always defend their unnoticed films by saying, ""who cares about critics, what do they know""? Well, people who love film also feel like that sometimes. This is a beautiful film that is wise, cool, and intense in its own subtle way. It is a damn shame it has been unappreciated. It is one of the best films of the year.",A Most Violent Year

Not gangsters like in 'The Godfather', no... gangsters like a four year old would write about after an innocent school yard squabble. I'd watch any film with Jessica Chastain in, (hence the three stars) but this film is so slow, so boring, and so nonviolent, that I was looking on ways to sue the makers for misleading me with the title.I'm sorry, but this film is a waste of two hours, so give it a miss.",A Most Violent Year
121,shadowyx12,"Instead of a crime thriller filled to the brim with violence, we get...",8,11 February 2015,"SHORT REVIEW (for people who don't care):The narrative does not takes place over a time-frame as long as the title would suggest - nor does is it contain as much violence. Instead, what we get is a gritty, realistic, meticulously-written, character-driven crime-drama that's mainly composed of dialogue and a fair bit of action (and lots of running). That being said, I figure that people who tend to favour more flashy/action-packed fare will be disappointed (especially with the pacing). For those wanting a film that casts a harsh shadow on the American Dream and forces us to reflect on the ugliness that comes packaged with an unfair society - look no further. Regardless of who you are, I recommend watching 'A Most Violent Year' at least once.VERDICT: RENT IT... then buy it if you think the film is worthy of further analysis.LONG REVIEW: 'A Most Violent Year' stands as another solid entry in Chandor's filmography. Despite this being his third film, this writer-director has already grabbed the attention of the aspiring filmmaker inside me - and has made me keep a close eye on his work.As the two leads give outstanding performances, the rest of the cast tries it best to be just as fantastic. Oscar Issac gives a damning performance as a business leader struggling to keep himself from becoming someone he'll regret. However, what really makes his performance memorable is the amount of restrain he forces out of his character despite the immense amounts pressure heaped against him on all sides of his life. Not only does Abel have a business to run, but he also has to worry about his employees getting hit, securing loans to expand his company, and a really stringent district attorney (played by the brilliant David Oyelowo) who's suspicious of his company's history. Oh - and then there his family as well. Very rarely does Abel ever lose control; when he does, Issac makes it as satisfying as all hell.Jessica Chastain? She plays Abel's wife, Anna Morales. She's the sweet, kind, gentle, caring wife that any husband... okay, you're not buying it, are you? If you watch this movie, you'll know why she was nominated for so many awards for this character.Another element of this film that I really have to commend the filmmakers for is the cinematography. It should be noted that a good portion of the film takes place around snow. As snow is usually really hard to film, Bradford Young did an amazing job of not only composing some of the most amazing wide shots in recent memory, but also reminded me a lot of what Roger Deakins did for Fargo (a film that I really loved). Combined with the production design, it really did feel like Chandor transported me back to what was one of New York's most violent years.",A Most Violent Year
122,twotrybe,A Mostly Boring Depiction,3,24 January 2015,"When a movie is titled A Most Violent Year, you'd anticipate that you would get a depiction of that within the film. This film gives you none of that. You get a woeful tale of a real estate transaction that may or may not go through. You get theft of oil supplies but no redeeming payback. You get a couple who are nowhere near as drawn out like Carmen and Tony Soprano, in fact, you get very little gangster at all. It's gangster lite. The only bloodshed comes from a suicide and that was met with concern over the oil dripping from a tank after being struck by the bullet. There was more concern of the oil being lost versus the live. Somewhere in the middle of this I was ready to bail but thought perhaps, maybe it will be a better payout in this slow paced film about New York in 1981. Apparently, not too much went on.",A Most Violent Year
123,movies-by-db,The consequences of violence,8,12 June 2015,"So I read a lot of complaints about the movie being slow and missing tension and violence. Why? Because of the title? Do the viewers nowadays pick their movies just on title and trailer?The title is perfect: This movie is all about violence. Every single moment in this film is a consequence of- or triggered by violence. Even all the news broadcasts on the radio are about violence. Abel's business is, as he says ""in a rough patch"". There are good years and bad years and this one is a particularly bad one. The fact that the movie doesn't feature a lot of violence makes it an even better one as the threat of it is constantly palpable.As for the tension: my god, what tension did I feel. I won't describe moments, but one particular chase sequence had me biting my nails, and I haven't done that in a very long time. There is constant tension in almost every scene and almost unbearable tension in some. And of course throughout the whole film you keep asking yourself; is he that honest, will he yield, or will he even snap. Oscar Isaac's role as Abel is written and played out so well I can understand the comparisons to Pacino's Michael Corleone in the Godfather. Hell you could even mention the two films in one breath. It has a great classic feel to it, though this is much smaller and more intimate. A modern classic like: ""We own the night"" by James Gray or the recent ""The Drop"" by Michael R. Roskam. Beautiful slow burning masterpieces. This film will stay with me for quite a while. I'll put it away, wait for a rainy day somewhere in winter and experience it all over again. 8/10",A Most Violent Year

Lo and behold, a few hours later I watched this... and he was Al Pacino! But this is no cheap imitation though. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the acting, the pacing and the tension generated by the constant threat of a mafia style shoot-out. No CGI, no stylised thrills/action, and best of all... surprisingly few clichés.What we got instead, was an accurate portrayal of 1981 NYC. Complete with political realities, historical change... and ordinary characters being ordinarily horrible.Films are just entertainment. I was entertained. And it was good to see 'Al' back! Much more enjoyable than many of the pretentious 'oscar seekers' currently on offer.",A Most Violent Year
125,fanbaz-549-872209,Oil tanker theft steals the story,3,27 January 2015,"When you read the press release for this movie, the stuff that tells you what you are going to see, or in this case, not going to see, you will imagine The Most Violent Year is a gripping tale full of old fashion action. It is not. It is over two hours of a plodding leaden cliché packed zero drama that had me sleeping soundly until the hero and his wife hit a something on the road in their car. The crash woke me and I spent another hour watching the scaled down hero in his camel coat being a GOOD MAN while the bad guys and hard as nails cops take him for a ride. The hero has two expressions. Honest and very honest. His wife has one. Tears that say she is a strong woman. Like when she bumps-off the animal that got run down. The story is basic. Someone is knocking off the hero's oil. He is losing money fast. He can't pay his bills. And he has just bought a mansion to go with his camel coat. Hey! Time to call in the heaters. But no. He is HONEST. Even though his old lady has gun, he will not give into the law of jungle. In the closing scene he tells the cop that life is just a series of small steps. Getting there is not the point. It is making the right choices for each step. I wish I'd known that before. I would have stepped well away from The Most Violent Year. Oh, and there is a head-case that that does the current pea-brain movie industry standard with a gun and his brains.",A Most Violent Year

It is quite simply dull and boring, and it's title is misleading because there is virtually no violence in this drivel. The script is seriously lacking in anything akin to exciting. This is perhaps the most dull gangster movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. How on earth people fund disasters like this is a mystery to me. Maybe it's some tax dodge to write it off as non tax-deductible. If this film was chocolate, there wouldn't be enough to fill an M&M. Okay, the actors were very good (that's why I've scored it 3/10), but good acting a movie it don't make. We want drama and excitement, not talk-talk-talk. A complete and utter waste of time. I'm sure it must have went straight to DVD, but it should have went straight to the dustbin.",A Most Violent Year
127,charlesem,Do the Most Right Thing,7,16 March 2017,"In a movie that might have been called ""Do the Most Right Thing,"" Oscar Isaac plays yet another ethically challenged protagonist. Abel Morales is not as cranky as Llewyn Davis or as politically savvy as Nick Wasicsko, the beleaguered Yonkers mayor of the 2015 HBO series Show Me a Hero, but he's another little guy who deserves better than the forces opposed to him will allow. He's no moral paragon: He couldn't have built a successful heating oil company in New York City without bending a few of the rules -- and without the help of his less-scrupulous wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain). It's 1981, and Morales is on the brink of a big deal, purchasing property on the East River that will enable him to eliminate some of the middlemen in the business. But then everything starts going awry: His trucks are being hijacked and the district attorney (David Oyelowo) has decided to make him a target in his exposé of corrupt practices in the heating oil business. It's a gritty urban tale, the kind that the movies haven't seen much of lately, demanding an audience that doesn't demand a lot of glamour and knows how to wait patiently for things to unfold. J.C. Chandor, who wrote the screenplay, resists the temptation to reveal too much too swiftly, building a quiet tension as we begin to bring the story into focus. He also handles action well, as the title suggests, although much of the violence is latent. Best of all, he showcases some fine performances, not only from Isaac and Chastain and Oyelowo, but also from Albert Brooks as Morales's attorney, Elyes Gabel as one of the victimized truck drivers, and Alessandro Nivola as one of Morales's mobbed-up competitors. There are moments when the script's depiction of Morales's determination to go as straight as possible seems a little too much like forcing him into the good-guy role, and the climax is too melodramatic, but on the whole it's a solid movie.

The competition plays dirty while he wants to stay an honest man. Abel's moral struggle is what the narrative revolves around. Jessica Chastain play Anna, Abel's wife and business partner. She is equally as powerful, assertive and dominant as he is, if not more so.The director did a wonderful job at creating a tense, sad and dramatic mood throughout. The cinematography is wonderful, the subtle moody soundtrack plays a big part in creating a feeling of impending doom throughout the entire movie, and I am very impressed by the recreation of a 1981 New York. It's very immersive.While nothing mainstream audiences will drool over, I find ""A Most Violent Year"" an excellent drama.

133,TheUniquePerception,Real look inside business competition,8,25 November 2016,"Sorry to everyone that believes successful businesses are built on violence and corruption. This movie illustrates the pressures and strategies required to build a real business. It never has anything to do with sex, bribes, violence, etc. Not that those stories do not exist, but they are shooting stars which are fast, bright and short lived. To complete the marathon it takes a cool head when all others panic and over react to the stress and chaos. Why did this movie fall short of the expectations of the American film audience? Simple. Nothing was exaggerated. The main character in this film plays the long game. He sees all the angles. He knows how everything is connected. People lie. He floats above it all to maintain his honor. He can still get down and dirty without crossing the lines he has drawn to govern his moral code. He still does this without fear while working towards his goal of ever expanding his business. When questioned as to why he does it all, he fails to understand the question. It is not in his nature to accept failure or a static existence. As a first generation business owner I respect the honesty and reality revealed in this movie. Sex, crimes and car chases produce two results: quickly failed businesses and Hollywood blockbusters. Perhaps the American public does not enjoy films that reflect reality too closely.",A Most Violent Year
134,peter-j-downey,"Not very violent, and about a week long.",3,25 January 2015,"A Most Violent Year stars Oscar Isaac as Abel Morales; an able, moral capitalist, in a corrupt 1981 New York. The film centres around Morales trying to acquire a oil storage facility that will allow him to expand exponentially, but will put him heavily in debt if it falls through. However, everything out of Morales control interferes with this acquisition.Being familiar with all the literary influences for this film made it boring: Oscar Isaac staring across the bay; The Great Gatsby, ""The noble capitalist""; Ayn Rand, are the two that jumped out at me. Consequently, the film feels derivative; even the plots progression follows themes that have been exhausted. About 10 minutes into the film I knew how it was going to end, and even how every scene was going to end. Just to point it out; ""Able Morals"" here is going to finish everything as ably and morally as possible.The historical context also film drains the film of tension; Reganominics was on the horizon, the cleanup of New York, the breaking up of the unions etc. You almost know who is going to be a thorn in Morales side next. You may pick on me for being pedantic, but this film takes itself very seriously, and everything in the film is deliberate, and when you know what they are going for the film loses so much of its veneer.This is also the first film I have seen directed by J. C. Chandor and he did a great job establishing tone. Chandor always places Morales in powerful positions on the screen, he also uses gold tints to give a sense of decay and tackiness. He, however, repeats scenes and this added to my boredom; I think there are 4 running scenes, 6 power exchanges, and many, many negotiation scenes.Acting in the movie was suffocated by everything else. Oscar Isaac has only one motivation in the film; be as stoic as possible. Sometimes he cracks and the emotions are lost in how little impact the rest of the film has. Jessica Chastain character might as well been called Lady MacBeth, and she does make a commendable attempt at adding depth to the character, but I disdained the cliché. All the other actors are just background noise, and secondary characters felt wooden.This is an uninteresting movie, that never fully develops, has no satisfying conclusion, and breaks no new ground.",A Most Violent Year

136,andy-66447,Supremely Interesting Story Highlights Sleeper Hit Of 2014,9,21 August 2015,"J.C. Chandor's A Most Violent Year takes place in 1981 New York City – the year New York suffered more murders than in any other. Without knowing a thing about A Most Violent Year, I looked forward to a police procedural or a mafia thriller, dealing with the homicidal apex to the desperation of the recession of 1980. But I was wrong. Very wrong.Oscar Isaac plays Abel Morales, owner of a New York fuel oil company, in the midst of purchasing property along the East River which would position his company as a major player in the regional fuel oil market. Simultaneously, a rival firm is attacking Morales' truck drivers and stealing their fuel. Morales' wife, Anna, is descended from a mafia family, and she offers their assistance. But Abel Morales is a good and decent businessman, and he resists. At first. As the driver attacks amplify, Morales' salesmen and even his family are soon targeted by the rival businessmen. Meanwhile, an assistant district attorney, played by David Oyelowo of ""Selma,"" is investigating corruption in the local fuel oil industry, including Morales' firm. And the deal to purchase the East River property becomes dubious when his bank backs out of financing it. All this is set against the backdrop of the 1981 New York murders. The murders themselves are not the story, but we hear about them anytime one of the characters turns on a radio.Now this set-up may sound like a glorified TV movie, but A Most Violent Year is so much more. As the tension in Morales' life builds, director Chandor draws us into the story the way Martin Scorsese does. We find ourselves pulling for an honest businessman in an increasingly dishonest world. We wonder how long it will take until he involves his wife's mafia family – or worse, takes matters into his own hands. This could be a story about one man's downward spiral, but with a resolution that will surprise and delight you. And you'll love the thrill ride along the way – culminating in a chase scene through the bowels of New York's subway and rail systems. It's as riveting as Gene Hackman's chase scene in The French Connection.The performances are top-notch, beginning with relative newcomer Oscar Isaac in the lead role. A year ago, he played a folk singer in the Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, a small, above-average picture which got buried in the onslaught of excellent films released at the end of 2013. Isaac really shines here. He should have received a Best Actor nod, but I'm sure his day is coming. Coincidentally, Isaac is slated to appear in the new Star Wars picture, which hits theatres next fall.Jessica Chastain is also excellent as Morales' wife – a decent-hearted lady who wishes her husband were a little more daring in his business dealings. Her character is more than the standard ""wife"" character we've seen many times before. She's intimately involved in the business, and she's not afraid to stand up to adversaries. An almost unidentifiable Albert Brooks plays Morales' lawyer Andrew, again intimately involved in the business, but more than just the ""straight man"" character we've seen before. And I love how Chandor's script allows us to become acquainted with various characters in Morales' life and in his business – a truck driver and his wife, a salesman, the teamster boss who pushes for Morales to arm his drivers, a couple of Morales' business competitors, and so forth. Each character is well-drawn, and serves an important role in this supremely interesting story.I also like the look of this picture. It's a bit of a modern-day film noir, cast in dimly-lit interiors, with characters who speak in hushed tones about important matters, occasionally bursting into the sunny yet unpredictable and unnerving outside world.The only thing I didn't like about A Most Violent Year is its title. Much as the 1987 film Dirty Dancing had nothing to do with pole dancers at strip clubs, A Most Violent Year has nothing to do with violence, per se. In fact, I don't really understand what necessitated placing the story in 1981. The fact that New York's murder rate peaked that year is immaterial to the story.A Most Violent Year is going to be a sleeper amongst Oscar contenders like Birdman, Selma, The Theory Of Everything, and others. But it's well worth a look. They don't make movies like this much anymore, and I'm glad J.C. Chandor has. It's one of this year's best films.",A Most Violent Year

140,Prabhat_KS,Tightly knit script with a captivating performance from all,8,4 February 2016,"To begin with, 'A most violent year' is not an action film at all. It is wrongly mentioned in the sub-heading on IMDb page. It is a drama with a mild thrill. But it is an elegantly made drama with a well-written, tightly knit story. Period details are decently done.As you would have seen or read by now, the movie is essentially about a struggling businessman in 1981's New York. It is his story – how he goes about expanding his business and the problems he faces.The treatment of lead characters in the film (Abel, Anna and Lawrence) by the script-writers is highly commendable. The viewers remain uncertain about probity of characters till the very end. I don't remember seeing such meticulous character development in my recent cinematic experience. We are accustomed to figuring out the good, bad and ugly in beginning itself. But here, we are constantly ambiguous regarding integrity of Abel (Oscar Isaac) and Anna (Jessica Chastain). In the last scene, even the character of District Attorney Lawrence (played by David Oyelowo) breaks down into ambiguity and we are left wondering about rectitude of the characters.The character played by Jessica Chastain - Anna - impressed me the most. It switches seamlessly between a responsible matriarch, an anxious wife, an intelligent escort, a methodical accountant and a gangster's cold daughter. It's like a personification of the Meredith Brooks' song 'Bitch'! It is indeed a dominating role and her presence is palpable all through the story.Overall, this film is a linear drama, a bit slow but with an outstanding script and captivating performance by all actors. It is one of those films you treasure for posterity and recommend frequently to your friends.",A Most Violent Year
141,theSachaHall,"A Frustratingly Exceptional Film That Is Sometimes, Just Plain Frustrating",9,25 January 2015,"MARGIN CALL's J.C Chandor continues to prove how masterful he is at balancing understated boldness with restrained menace in his latest film A MOST VIOLENT YEAR. The film's metaphoric contradictions will have you transfixed from the get go: attentively attuned to the thrilling, fast-paced action one second and then BAM! You're frustrated beyond belief because the pace of this gripping film is so sluggishly steady it'll have you begging the screen 'C'mon – give me something'! It's THE GODFATHER in warm yellow tones, but not. It's about principled capitalism, unscrupulous greed, and veiled menace but it's also about family and respect. It's beautifully drab and uncomplicatedly shot. It's a most 'emotionally' violent year indeed.It's 1981 and New York is in the midst of one of the most violent and deadly crime waves in its history: murders and assaults are reported upon in every broadcast, corruption is rife, and businesses are at risk, testing the fortitude of the city's businessmen including Standard Heating Oil owner Abel Morales (Isaac).An honourable immigrant who worked his way up through the company before taking over the business from his father-in-law, Morales thought he was living the American dream: his business is doing well despite the city's hardships, their family recently moved into a new palatial home, and he successfully negotiated the purchase of a prime port property that will secure the business' future and its domination of the market. With contracts signed and deposits paid, Morales has 30 days in which to secure enough investor funding to pay the balance in full and close the transaction, otherwise he (and the business) will go broke.The story follows Morales and his wife Anna (Chastain) as they take steps to secure investment funding and save their business. Their gamble begins to unravel when Morales and his lawyer Andrew (Brooks) approach the D.A. (Oyelowo) and ask for help in regards to the violent hijackings of their trucks and assaults on their employees. Instead of providing assistance, the D.A. informs Morales that he and Standard Heating Oil are under investigation for fraudulent practices and that an indictment is imminent within days. Shortly after the indictments are served, the bank loses faith and subsequently reneges on their agreement to finance the deal. In addition, one or more of his competitors continue to intimidate and scare his drivers and hijack their fuel trucks at gunpoint. As the time frame narrows down to mere days, Morales is forced to weigh the morality of continuing to run 'a fair and clean business' against his single-minded determination for success. 'If I were you, I'd treat us with a little more respect, or I guarantee, he will make it his mission in life to ruin you' Anna tells the D.A. as the Police search their house.The dynamic between Isaac and Chastain as they confide and ally with each another on screen is intense and mesmerising to watch. Isaac, with his perfectly coiffed hair and serious businessman attire, is arresting as he skulks around the city determined to hold on to his American Dream ideology whilst Chastain, the ball-busting mobsters daughter, commandeers their shadowy world 'doing the things Abel didn't want to know about' ruthlessly. His ying to her bang.Chandor's exceptional film is a tightly wound coil, tensioned to pop but doggedly determined to never get there.Go see it! It's frustratingly good, and sometimes, just plain frustrating. Dammit, now I'm frustrated.You can read more at my Twitter handle or at The Hollywood News.",A Most Violent Year

Not because it's a bad movie, but because the title and the trailer make it sound like it's going to be violent and action filled, that its not. J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost) directs a movie that would be better suited to the decade that the film takes place, as I fear it will be lost in the instant gratification era that we live. Set in 1981 New York during one of the highest years of crime on record, Oscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis) plays ""Abel Moralles"" a sharp dresser and family man who has inherited a heat oil company. Life is going great until unknown assailants begin to hijack his oil trucks, and send him threats. His wife, played by Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) only complicates things as his company's bookkeeper and all around ball buster, constantly belittling him for not taking matters into his own hands. This is a quite, thinking mans movie, all the more reason most people will be turned off by it as it's being marketed as something more violent.",A Most Violent Year
143,daadv,Pretty good film with very strong performances and growing tension,7,10 January 2016,"Abel Morales owns a Heating Oil Co whose trucks are being hijacked, causing the loss of plenty of money just when it's trying to expand. Morales gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble, as he refuses to answer violence with violence.Truth to be told, the trailer and the title cheat quite a bit: If you're looking for a very violent gangster movie, with plenty of bloody and explicit scenes, this is not your film. If you're expecting fast paced action or a new Godfather like film, you're up for a disappointment.That being said, this is a pretty good film, with very strong performances, where tension grows up as time goes by. The pace is quite slow, but if you like this kind of movies, you're in for a treat. Now, don't be fooled. Despite the slow pace, several scenes will make your heart rate's race. The image quality and cinematography are good, despite some kind of weird yellowish tone in certain scenes. Sound is good, but a bit low. Despite the misleading advertising, this is a movie I would recommend.",A Most Violent Year
144,rafael105,A most pretentious load of twaddle,4,22 March 2015,"Very much an attempt to shoot a sitcom as if it were Shakespeare. The plot revolves around a heating-oil executive's attempts to maintain an ethical attitude in the face of nasty competition and the pressures of ambition. The premise could become a worthy exploration of human nature if it were written and directed by David Mamet (think Glengarry Glen Ross). In the hands of J.C. Chandor, it turns into 125 grueling minutes of mood and mannerism without substance. The screenplay is flat and has more loose ends than the awful hairdo they have burdened poor Jessica Chastain with. (She is the only good thing in the picture, by the way.) The characters are uniformly stiff and one- dimensional, parading through a tired range of racial stereotypes and NYC-movie clichés: the politically ambitious African-American DA, the emotionally unstable Latino youth, the orthodox Jewish businessman with a heart of gold, and so on. By far the worst part is the main character, played by Oscar Isaac. It is hard to say if he was directed to do a bad impression of Al Pacino in the Godfather or if this was his own clever idea. Either way, it's excruciating to watch him trying to lend gravitas to lines so banal they could come out of a Brady Bunch movie. Awful screenplay, hiding behind camera and music that try desperately to induce you to lend some sort of emotional weight to what is actually a boring exercise in form and genre. Mr. Chandor should be barred from making films until he apologizes for this.",A Most Violent Year
145,brooklynjm,A fine film - you might need to pay attention,9,20 January 2015,"A thoughtful, beautiful film - fine acting, an excellent script, beautiful camera-work. Interesting to see naysayers complaining ""nothing happens"" - a great deal happens - but no gratuitous beatdowns, no jazzy editing, no hammy scene stealing - and no 'nostalgia' or playing for camp associations II loved American Hustle, but did notice how I had some difficulty seeing the characters behind the costumes and wigs). Oscar Isaac is on screen virtually the entire film, and you can't take your eyes off him - but he is quiet, watchful, smart. Jessica Chastain's role is less visible, but her character hovers over the film - her enmeshment with her husband. Chastain's standout line (from memory): ""You don't want to see what happens if I have to get involved."" Interestingly, the conclusion at first felt like a letdown. But with a few minutes reflection, an unspoken element, based on clear signals earlier in the film, makes for a spectacular denouement: SPOILER: Where did the money Chastain 'skimmed' really come from? What was her background? What does that mean for Isaac's attempts to stay out of the mud? The signals click into place. Also: The title refers to the reallife events occurring in the city that years, quietly simmering away onradio (remember radio?) and TV broadcasts. The violence in the film was occasional, unexpected - and inevitable. The etire film had a stately feeling. We saw an entire distany panorama unfold that had unexpected resonance with events today.

146,dangent280,Sympathy for the Devil,8,28 January 2015,"J. C. Chandor's, A Most Violent Year, is the second of two films released in the past week, the first being Ex Machina, that include Star Wars -bound Oscar Isaac, who is slowly becoming one of my favourite actors. I first noticed Isaac when watching Inside Llewyn Davis, yet after looking at his back catalogue, it's surprising to see the wide range of films he has been a part of, such as Drive and two Ridley Scott efforts; Robin Hood and Body of Lies respectively, all of which are pretty fab, particularly, Drive. Similarly, Jessica Chastain also seems to be in films that particularly appeal to me, such as Zero Dark Thirty, and most recently, Interstellar, yet the third cog in this particular wheel, director J, C. Chandor, hasn't won me over, yet, with his last effort, All Is Lost, not enthralling me in the slightest. Still, two out of three ain't bad. The film is set during the latter stages of 1981 New York, a time in which, statistically, crime rates reached an all time high, particularly those consisting of a rather violent ilk, and tells the story of Abel Morales, who attempts to expand his business by purchasing a new, and valuable, piece of land. In the background however, his oil trucks are repeatedly being stolen and sold on, whilst the DA, played by Selma's, David Oyelwo, is running an investigation into potential illegal activity within his empire. Within my review for Ex Machina, I stated Isaac's performance was, ""top notch,"" and the same can be said for his performance in this film, with his portrayal of a character, who, although the title suggests otherwise, attempts to stay within the boundaries of the law despite all of the ongoing threats to him and his business, being simply brilliant.Adding to this brilliance, is Jessica Chastain, who plays the role of Anna Morales superbly, and who, in contrast to her husband, is no stranger to violence thanks to her father's gangster background. The chemistry between the two leads is explosive, and helps develop the way in which each character changes throughout the course of the movie, particularly Abel, who transforms from an almost reluctant hero into a no-nonsense hard-man. These strong performances help keep the film going, particularly when it is at its' weakest, with the rather shallow plot taking a while to kick in, and just slightly stretching its' two-hour run-time.Overall, A Most Violent Year, is J. C. Chandor's best film to date, helped particularly by two terrific performances from Isaac and Chastain. Although its' rather simple plot is stretched into the film's run-time, the film is an entertaining and gripping crime drama that can stand strong next to other films in the same genre. Overall Score: 8/10",A Most Violent Year
147,gwmdeclare,"Hollow,false and way too proud of itself.",4,30 January 2015,"I spent a lot of time working in NYC in the '70s and '80s. It was a scary place. The danger as real and one did not walk freely about. Everyone had horror stories of they or someone they knew being robbed and/or beaten, raped, groped or menaced in some threatening way. In my experience it was scary in every big city in America at the time but NYC was in a class by itself. Michael Winner's 1974 'Death Wish' with Charles Bronson may seem over the top to today's viewers but it more accurately than not captures the violent chaos of those days. I was looking forward to seeing a recreation of those times as there is a lot of fertile ground to till but here the the fields lie strangely fallow. Nothing, in this movie, evokes, the reality of the time. We hear snippets of news reports. That's it. The movie takes place almost entirely, in abandoned industrial areas, bleak offices or the protagonist's new, modern house isolated deep in some unspecified leafy suburb. For all but one, the locations could be almost anywhere. The movie purports to show the how the competing forces in the heating oil business conducted themselves and our hero's struggle to keep to the moral high ground. This is all, laughably, naive and presented with a plodding, leaden seriousness not helped much by the clichéd stock characters that occupy the supporting cast. Oscar Isaac's earnest, one note, Pacino impersonation and Jessica Chastain's shallow stab at a tough, Brooklyn mob boss daughter are more distracting than engaging. One senses that Chastain was having some fun with it but she really doesn't have enough to do.There's a rich characterisation in there somewhere that never has a chance to be realised even though the movie seems to last forever. All in all JC Chandor is in way over his head here. All he manages to convey is strong sense of his own misplaced self importance.",A Most Violent Year
148,SConIrish,Not to be missed.,9,24 March 2015,"Since the passing of the great Sidney Lumet, purveyor of some of the great films of the seventies, including Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, The Verdict and Network, no American filmmaker has emerged to lay claim to the thrown. Lumet shooting largely on the streets of New York using hundreds of locations to make films about corruption and crime featuring some extraordinary performances from the likes of Al Pacino, Paul Newman and Peter Finch. J. C. Chandor announces himself as one of the most interesting directors working today, with a capacity for complexity and nuance in his narratives. Fresh from the Robert Redford alone at sea suspensor here he delivers one of the best American films of the past year. Sadly few people will see it.New York City 1981 one of the most violent years in the City's history, more murders and rapes in the city than anytime before. It is at this moment that the emerging businessman Abel Morales chooses to expand his business. Unfortunately rival competitors are robbing his Standard oil trucks of their contents. They are also threatening his family, the District Attorney (David Oyelowo) is in the process of bringing a case against him for inappropriate practices in the industry. The unions are demanding their drivers to carry handguns in the trucks, and the bank is starting to lose faith in Abel's ability to payback loans. His wife Anna (Chastain), the daughter of a gangster carefully keeps the books, and he has just moved into a big new house in an upper scale neighbourhood. Progressively his life begins to spiral and the moral question remains, will he resort to violence or calmly use other methods to achieve his dream?Credit must go to Bradford Young the cinematographer who recently lensed Selma. He captures a noir darkness that imbues the film. A scene in a barber shop early in the pic, between Abel and one of his competitors recalls Gordon Willis's work in The Godfather, the light accentuates the face but everything else in the frame is dark and ominous. As the central protagonist Isaac is compelling, Isaac first came to my attention playing Jose Ramos- Horta in Balibo and more recently in the Coen brothers Inside Llewyn Davis. His Abel is an immigrant who is determined to fulfill the promise of the American dream without resorting to the temptation to use violence to solve his problems. It's a clam understated performance rarely resorting to histrionics to carry a scene, and yes it recalls Pacino's work in The Godfather. Chastain is his equal as his more tempestuous tough-minded wife, who would clearly kill to protect her children. Oyelowo and Brooks provide great support.Not to be missed.",A Most Violent Year

Oscar Isaac has done some Stirling work in the past, not least 'Inside Llewyn Davis' and Jessica Chastain in ""The Help"" and ""Lawless"" was flawless, but even they cannot save the slow and uninteresting dialogue in this film. One scene in a room with the two of them is 15 minutes long and there is a hefty pause between each line.

Inside Llewyn Davis was also a beautiful effort. So I guess that means that he gets the benefit of the doubt for any of his future work. He'll need it for this.This movie falls into the laudable sub-trend in Hollywood to try to depart from their lockstep story-driven editing and formula-driven writing. That's what the movie is not. What it is, isn't much. The movie is about an honest business owner in a syndicate-controlled industry being tempted into criminal acts to protect his business, and to make matters worse, he has the same hairstylist as Al Pacino in the first Godfather. So after this setup for the protagonist who is inexorably driven into a life of crime, this movie breaks that cliché, and instead of giving into temptation, the guy just passively allows stuff to happen. Even the idea of waiting for the cops to pick up the gangster who has been harassing his business, instead of allowing him to escape, is too much of an active role for our protagonist. The moral of the story is that non-proactive nice guys win in the end. As for the movie, I don't think that everyone will be awake by the end.",A Most Violent Year

Oscar Isaac is no bad actor, but he is no (the new) Al Pacino either as some people have been trying to portray him as.This film is boring, not badly acted, but then so are many other rubbish films being churned out of Hollywood.

154,lesliecolejr,'A Most Violent Year' is as Real as it Gets.,10,12 August 2015,"""A Most Violent Year"" stars Oscar Isaac as the owner of the Standard Heating Oil home heating business. His wife and Chief Financial Officer is played by Jessica Chastain. Abel Morales (Isaac) after acquiring the company from Anna Morales' (Chastain) father employs Andrew Walsh, played by Albert Brooks, as the company's Lawyer. When rogue thugs violently hijack one of his trucks driven by Julian (Elyes Gabel), Abel is awakened to the possibility that other competing oil companies may be in cahoots. Abel's suspicions are heightened when several more of his trucks are hijacked for the precious fuel and resold at other storage facilities. As if the hijackings weren't enough of a distraction to his nascent enterprise, New York City District Attorney Lawrence (David Oyelowo) hints to Abel that prosecution could be looming. According to the D.A., the Standard Heating Oil company has been breaking the law for years and he can prove it. Abel begins to feel pressure from the Teamsters' President Bill O'Leary (Peter Gerety) to allow union drivers that work for Standard Heating Oil to carry guns. He offers to get them all permits and warns that without being armed, the Teamsters may not be able to supply Standard Heating Oil with drivers much longer. With thousands of gallons of fuel being stolen each week and drivers being sent to the hospital, Abel faces a moral crossroads. He cannot continue to allow his business to suffer financial losses. Arming drivers could put his business in legal jeopardy. Pending litigation may alienate the banks that bankroll his whole operation. What's an oil boss to do? Abel's choices will either catapult his business into the stratosphere of elite oil companies, or bring it crashing down into a fireball of a tumultuous ruin.The most notable aspect of ""A Most Violent Year,"" ironically, is the absence of excessive violence. Instead, conflict resolution through means other than violence establishes itself as the dominant theme of the film. The meticulous, savvy approach of Abel, clad in suit and tie and beige overcoat, is more precise than a laser and scope atop an automatic rifle. Abel possesses the exterior grit and guise of Al Pacino's Michael Corleone tempered by a resolve and restraint that is all of his own making. Abel gets his point across by the gesture of his hands, by the snarl of his top lip, and yes, though fortuitously, with gun in steadied and measured hand. At heart, Abel is content to be a businessman, not a gangster, and employ his most potent weapon at any given moment-killer charm. J.C. Chandor's direction avails ""A Most Violent Year"" a human quality. The film feels real and never overly fantastic or unbelievable. Alex Ebert's score is manifold-as heavy or light as frozen snow crunched upon or first fallen. Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain play out a volatile marriage with as much, if not more, anxiety and potential intensity as a slow gas leak. Cinematographer Bradford Young captures some of the most sweeping backdrops you'll ever see in a film. The recreation of 1980's New York is fun to watch in a phantasmagoria of some real and some imagined graffiti.

The one act of violence is one of desperation and sadness. the main character of this film is a more than nice, good as gold off the boat type. no gangster vive for this guy he is all light colored trench coats and well kept hairdos. Even his wife is more of a crook than he is. He is if I can say it the Ned Flanders of this film. and this is the problem. He is pushed, poked and prodded and does nothing, cause he is the ""good guy"" and really who wants to see that. I was waiting for this guy to lose it and go ape on those punks. but it never happens, the movie just puddles along and he seems to slip though it all with little or no consequence. IK mean OK, I get it its a movie about a man who has some morals, but really, the title asks me to think other wise. I think this movie while entertaining is also annoying, the development of the characters didn't make me care about them in the slightest. things happened that were not fully explored in the plot of the film and we as the viewer were cheated by not having a shock ending or some climax to tie the movie together. so good for a Sunday afternoon but not as a serious film",A Most Violent Year

He has 30 days to get financiers together, in order to close the deal; otherwise he loses his deposit and risks bankruptcy. During this period, as Abel's trucks start getting hijacked and his wife is pleading for him to fight back, his company also becomes under investigation by the Assistant DA. Morales has to sustain pressure on all fronts to attain the success he so eagerly desires.The themes and even the visual style of ""A Most Violent Year"" are reminiscent of many crime films of the 70's and early 80's, in particular ""The Godfather Part II"": not only for the lighting (shadows over the characters' eyes) and color palette (dark yellow and brown), but also due to Oscar Isaac's Abel Morales, whose overall conduct and mannerisms recall a young Michael Corleone.This film isn't another generic crime thriller with lots of explosions and shootouts; it builds on suspense, at a steady pace, as it tries to push its main character over the edge. ""A Most Violent Year"" becomes a sort of meditative observation of a man struggling to maintain his values and ideals while the world he knows crumbles around him. While it is certainly a gritty film and it's obvious that J.C. Chandor has done his homework, I cannot help but feel he should have brought more of his own voice to it. He takes many influences but doesn't bring anything particularly new to the table; Abel is interesting, but I felt the plot could have serviced him (and the other characters) better than it does. ""A Most Violent Year"" stands on the shoulder of giants but doesn't try to reach higher. By the end of the film you're left disappointed, that what could have been easily a great film settled for less. To quote Abel Morales: ""When it feels scary to jump, that is exactly when you jump, otherwise you end up staying in the same place your whole life."" It's a shame J.C. Chandor didn't jump when he should have.",A Most Violent Year

I will answer that and say yes it is, whether intended or not.I just didn't believe these characters-that added to the fact they were not interesting in the least-I've sat though Lifetime movies that were more compelling. I don't think the acting is bad, it's just ultimately an extremely banal story with no climax, or any kind of gestalt to make some kind of point. It just drones on and on as you wait for something exciting or interesting. How about a good old emotion or two, that would have been cool. There are a couple of scenes that try to be exciting, wow a car chase! He's pulling out a gun and ... oh he's putting it away without shooting it. The characters just don't really grab you, and the story is preposterous. J.C. Candor must have paid people to like this movie because I don't get what is so great about it! The most misleading title ever. I like a slow-burn, but this thing is a smoldering pile of poo.",A Most Violent Year

There are a couple of side stories within the film such as the main character trying to raise some cash to close a deal and one of his drivers having courage issues plus the Police wanting to look into his dealings a bit deeper but there's no real drama or interest at all ! I was expecting something much different than what it is so maybe I was just peeved that it didn't have what I would expect from a film with such high ratings. 2 hours of wishing it would end and when it finally did, I was so let down and felt cheated, that's why I recommend that you just don't bother with this one !",A Most Violent Year

165,tjlisson,Complex Characters,9,11 August 2020,"I'm surprised by the reaction most people have regarding the character of Abel Morales. Most people describe him as doing his best to run a legitimate business and lead an ethical life, and while there's some measure of truth to that, the film also demonstrates that his attitude is self-serving and self righteous - just as much hypocritical goody two shoes as the real thing. He is being investigated for illegal business activities, but tries to come off as being unjustly harassed by the District Attorney's office, even though the film leaves little doubt that the charges are at least partially true. Much worse, his drivers are frequently hi-jacked and fearful for their lives, but Abel cares little about helping them; he's basically just concerned about how it affects his business. After one of his drivers is badly beaten during one of the hijackings, he recovers, but returns to the job with a gun (which Abel is opposed to), and much as Abel fears, he panics and gets involved in a shootout with approaching would-be hijackers. But Abel has no empathy for the driver, just himself and his business. Near the end, when the driver, Julian, reappears, Abel makes it abundantly clear what he himself really cares about.",A Most Violent Year
166,Jacobsnemesis,Disappointing,4,24 January 2015,"The skeleton of a good film is here. It does look good and the setting of 80's New York makes for a very good back drop. There's also an excellent cast and a seemingly interesting story at the heart of it.But for me, it was a disappointment. The theme's of the film were overplayed. There was very little subtlety. Yes, we know that people are corrupt. Yes, we know the American Dream is a fallacy. Yes, we know there is a disconnect between the CEO and the normal working man. Yes, we know that chasing wealth and power is ultimately meaningless. The problem is that all of these things are overplayed and overstated in almost every scene. By the time that Jessica Chastian's character actually explicitly says the words ""American Dream"" in the final third of the film, you will most likely have given up caring about these central themes. All of these things have been done better by other films or TV dramas. The Wire dealt with most of these themes and did it in a much more impressive manner. None of it is believable. It has a good cast, but they all feel miscast. Oscar Isaac is the best example. He's not believable for one second as the self made business tycoon that he is supposed to be portraying.Then, there's the gangster elements to this film. At times, the film plays like a parody of the three Godfather films. The meeting of the bosses in the Italian restaurant is hilarious. Then we have the constant referral to Anna's dangerous family and Abel crying to his wife that he never wanted to be corrupted, which played off like a really bad version of the scene in Godfather 3 where Al Pacino says ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.""I could go on, but all I would say is that if you want a gangster film, watch The Godfather Part 1 or 2. If you want a political drama about corruption and the failed American dream, watch The Wire. If you want a crime movie set in the 80's, watch Scarface. Just avoid this overrated film.",A Most Violent Year
167,rickhouska,"If you're gonna do business with sharks, someone with teeth better be watching your back.",7,13 February 2015,"This is the third feature film of J. C. Chandor in as many years, after Margin Call and All Is Lost. My expectations were peaked, perhaps too much. Chandor shines a spotlight on people under serious stress, and we watch them sweat and deal with it. This seems to work best if the storyline aligns with personal experience, which need not be in the exact same arena. In A Most Violent Year we meet immigrant businessman, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac). He is good looking, intelligent, well dressed, ambitious, and the owner of a successful heating oil company in NYC, one that may be crossing lines and under the scrutiny of authorities. He is married to the beautiful and street smart Anna (Jessica Chastain), who keeps the books, raises their perfect kids, and live the good life in a big house in the burbs. All seems well as Abel is about to purchase a large oil storage depot and grow his business big time. About to close the deal bad things start to happen. A home intruder with a gun, the hijacking of his trucks, and the mugging of a young sales associate. None of this ruffles the self-assured Morales. He continues to run on his wits and basic belief in himself, until the bank pulls out of the deal. Unless he can come up with the cash ($1,5M) in a week, all is lost. It looks bleak. Anna is now quite unhappy, most about what she sees as Abel's passivity, and offers the assistance of her mob connected father. Undaunted, but feeling disrespected by his wife, Abel is determined to find a way out, without compromising a set of values which have always worked for him. What happens then to Abel and his family is the substance of this movie.Chandor's storytelling and direction has a certain flair and originality that is quite refreshing, but it is a long way from Bergman. There is violence in the movie, but it is relatively low key, compared with others out there. This movie is basically all about watching Abel deal with his predicament. Some of it predictable, some not. If you like this kind of dramatic emphasis, you may enjoy the movie.",A Most Violent Year
168,asbufra@yahoo.com,In order to beat them you must join them,7,1 January 2015,"** Spoilers** I started watching this movie expecting, Quentin Tarantino, Sam Peckinpah type violence. That is not what this movie is about. There is a fight or two and a gun appears a few times, but it is not violence that drives this movie. It is morality and how Abel reacts to his growing business being threatened by racketeers running New York's home heating fuel delivery industry. Abel's conflict is to stay clean while his enemies fight dirty. His wife, wonderfully played by Jessica Chastain, just wants to win. You decide if Abel succeeded in staying clean.A good movie will make you think, this one does; we all make decisions in our lives that define who we are. This movie is also a nice homage to French Connection and Godfather movies, a great gritty New York chase scene.

It's actually very different.A Most Violent Year is a film about a man's principles and his determination to stand by it. It's about a woman's unflinching support for her husband and her determination to stand by it. It is a character study of two very bold characters, played very efficiently by Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain.J. C. Chandor beautifully creates a study of two people, entwined in the bond of marriage, faith and their determination to succeed. Abel Morales, the character played by Oscar Isaac, has done the dirty deeds in the past to achieve his social status and doesn't want to indulge in any more crime neither leans for support from his illustrious father in law. Surrounded by detractors and competitor, he is an image of restraint and firm believer of his principles. Thereby creating a very different note from the usual gangster image. A markedly different person from the most violent year 1981 as depicted in the film.I feel it's not a classic film, with startling imagery and sequences, but it's a very good film for anyone who can appreciate a film which stays honest to its characters. Not too many films are made like this.",A Most Violent Year

174,potablepictureshow,Don't let this film go unseen just because it was Oscar snubbed,9,4 February 2015,"""A Most Violent Year"" is a good slow smolder full of restrained tension and nuance. It is one examination of the ""American Dream"" and what it takes to achieve it.Oscar Isaac is perfect as Abel Morales, understated at most times yet believable and charismatic. He has his own moral code, following ""the most right choice"". He says that the end result is never in doubt, the trick is in choosing the most right way to reach it. He lives and breathes his personal ambition to the point that it is not ambition but rather a natural thing build into his genetic code. At one point he is asked why he wants all this (success) to which Abel responds that he doesn't understand the question.Abel's wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), provides the on the surface emotion. Where Abel can be cool, calculated, and focused, Anna is the fire in the family. Flashy with her Armani dresses and long fingernails, she is also the mama lion, ready to draw blood when her territory is infringed upon. Her performance is a lot of fun to watch.Visually, the film is great. Plenty of background and depth for the characters to inhabit. This film takes place in 1981 and has somewhat of the gritty feel of films such as ""The French Connection"". The background never overshadows the characters and the framing never constricts the performances. The scenery is there to set this film in a time and place, one real enough to feel, hear, and smell.This film may be ""too slow"" for some, those that need the instant jolts, the unnecessary and illogical twist endings, or unrealistic and over the top shootouts. The few visceral thrills the film provides are very effective within the steady realistic pacing of the film. Avoid this film if you don't like the idea of considering what motivates people and psychologically evaluating what actually makes people tick. Definitely check this film out if you like good character pieces and performances with beautiful yet unobtrusive cinematography. This is a hidden gem among the 2014 crop of films.Blarv Score: 8.8 out of 10",A Most Violent Year

Unfortunately, that is the only glory moment. After having built up great expectations, the plot moves quickly downhill, excavating well past rock bottom.The glacially paced story is about an oil trader who wants to expand his business, but must face ""violent"" competition. However, the violence perpetrated boils down to beating and threatening. It may be scary enough in real life, but from the title one expects much worst when in fact the most violent action is perpetrated off-screen, on an innocent deer.Besides the slow-motion approach, what I disliked more is the unbearable pretentiousness.

177,forty_7,Eh...,6,26 August 2015,"Before I review ""A Most Violent Year,"" a couple of notes. 1) I haven't published a review on IMDb for 6 years and 2) this film is ABSOLUTELY worth seeing for Oscar Isaac's performance alone.Beautifully shot, the substance (plot-wise) of this film leaves a lot to be desired. The story revolves around crime and corruption, and the impending charges against Isaac's character / business. Unfortunately, there's very little crime and corruption in this crime and corruption tale. We pivot from noir gangster flick to whodunnit on a dime, and the whodunnit tale is certainly more intriguing, but is a muted thread within the film. The strength of this film is - without a doubt - Oscar Isaac's engrossing portrayal of Abel Morales (check out the Trivia page if you don't get this on-the-nose allegory), and he delivers a powerhouse performance in a wonderfully shot film that simply doesn't have the narrative power to remain engrossing. The somewhat open ending does not do Abel Morales - or Oscar Isaac's performance - justice, but if you enjoy well-acted, ""small"" (almost playhouse worthy) films, you couldn't do worse than this. Think ""No Country,"" but a ""No Country"" in which you didn't care about any of the characters, except for one.",A Most Violent Year

Men and Women of New York in 1981 try, and fail to keep their selves honest. Few succeed, the ones who do fight tooth and nail to prove that they are good people. Oscar Isaac plays the head of an oil company who is doing everything in his power to prove that he is running an honest business. His wife, played by Jessica Chastain, who having a shady past, stands by her husband through thick and thin. With police charging the company for things the previous owner did, their trucks being stolen and drained of all of the fuel and a wife who is insisting that her shady past could help, something has to break. This film is very captivating; there was no foreshadowing or hints as to what was coming next. I was alert and it had my full attention the entire time. You would imagine that the story would be the best part of this movie; while it is very good, it is not. These performances, especially from Oscar Isaac and David Oyelowo, who by the way has a better American accent than I do. Isaac kind of came out of nowhere and is taking America by storm, and I am not mad about that, every role he is in, weather it be Lewyn Davis, or A Most Violent Year, or the upcoming Star wars, he blends into his role so well that he could be anyone from any time period.Mikes Movie Minute",A Most Violent Year

The biggest conflict is the internal one. This requires a very gifted actor. One who can communicate the torment of the decisions he has to make. We have seen performances like this from some of the great actors of the past, those who can communicate a range of feelings without saying a word. Oscar Isaac is not such an actor. Nor does the husband wife conflict ever result in more than raised voices but certainly not raised emotions. Nor is the prospect raised that the father-in-law could easily get them money they need based on his mob connections. If it had, would have turned this down? We'll never know.

He plans on buying a land right by the river on the east side as it will give him access to open waters. He is going be the best in his business once that land is bought and invisible forces around him are not going to let that happen. ""A most violent year"" is a film about the nature of American capitalism and the dream that comes with it if you win it. that dream doesn't come without a cost however. Abel thinks that he has learned how to operate within this system. he tells his sells people to hold eye contact with the customers in order to gain their artificial trust. He'd like to think of himself as a man of integrity and pride but the game he is playing is not going to allow it. He is soon going to feel the punch in his face as he chooses tea over coffee.This is not an original story where the idea of the American dream is scrutinized and show to be deeply flawed. but J.C. Chandor chooses a very interesting angle and style to approach it. It contains very interesting and intense moments within that are cinematically perfect, but as a whole, the film lacks a certain element to bring it all together.

Yes, those who are overly impressed with their own intellect will find amazing things here - and they will be more than happy to exegete the film for all who will listen. But, the reality is far from amazing. There is definitely some spectacular acting, and the cinematography is superb. There is no doubt that this is NYC in 1981. Past that, you will be disappointed.The violence spoken of in the title, apart from a few gunshots and a pathetic suicide at the end, is nothing more than what you hear on the radio (and that rather muffled) throughout. Otherwise, you are asked to believe that Abel is apparently not the ""gangster with the heart of gold,"" but rather the gangster who is nearly emotionless and, while surrounded by corruption on all sides, is guided by an absolutely unwavering notion of ""the good."" (The name Abel obviously has biblical connotations: the brother who is attacked and murdered because he followed God's will, unlike Cain.) Absolutely nothing - attacks on his trucks and drivers, an intruder that leaves his young daughter playing with a loaded gun, the pummeling of his sales staff, the list goes on - moves him to anything more than raising his voice.At the same time, a most corrupt business run by corrupt families in one of the nation's most corrupt cities apparently has lone thugs stealing from it without fear of retribution, but when a mob family head is confronted by Abel, he nearly starts crying and confesses that others are buying the stolen fuel as well. I've seen more violence, intrigue, and genuine anger at a rural Ohio PTA meeting than in this entire film.If the attempt was either to reveal a deep humanity and noble character in some of those typically thought of as corrupt or to exhibit the pressures of society that suffocate the businessperson by looking at them through the lens of a ""gangster film,"" it fails on both counts.In the end, even with its most redeeming qualities, the film is slow, plodding, and thoroughly unbelievable.

191,marcossarno,"Not as far-out from other thrillers, but worth the watch",7,24 March 2019,"A Most Violent Year got my attention for all the buzz of it being the needle in the haystack among crime thrillers. Not only that but also the cast and the footage I've seen (featuring gorgeus cinematography from Bradford Young) were major components to make me watch this.Now that I've seen it, I must say I am a little disappointed. Which is unfortunate beacause it is a good film, but my expectations were too high.The dialogue often felt too artificial for a movie aiming towards a more realistic and somber tone, and it could also benefit from a slower editing pace between scenes, focusing more on mundane situations that underline the movie's themes rather than just dialogue to dialogue.
And that's assuming the film was heading towards conveying a bigger message, beacuse if the opposite was the case - in which there was no intention to display concern a certain matter or theme but rather tell a specific story about the oil business in that given year, the movie also didn't get there.It almost feels like the tone was very clear in the director's head, but it was forced into a cluster of scenes with no thematic context nor bigger cohesion (remember that making a movie without a ""bigger picture"" is still a decision regarding the thematic context, it never ceases to exist).On the other hand, the action sequences are handled very well by fitting the tone of the movie, that being of a smaller caliber but not lessening the tension. And that's one point where the editing does its job perfectly, just look at the chase sequence that involves Abel.The acting is superb, although the script could have explored other aspects on Jessica Chastain's character, like her constant struggle to face fear and uncertainty through decisions that go against what her husband believes, representing the oil industry's tendencies to illegal activities in contrast to Abel's strive to go the clean way, and how that relation works inside a marriage.Again, a well structured tone inside a movie that doesn't know exactly where it goes. But it's worth your time for bein a lesson on crafting economic and suspenseful action scenes, and also an interesting insight into the struggles of an righteous entrepeneur soaked into a world that does everything to corrupt him.",A Most Violent Year

The scene with her outside the house at their kid's birthday party was just amazing.Oscar Isaac does a solid job too! He is an actor who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine.They nailed early 1980's New York, the music, the tone, the look was all phenomenal. Great job for the art direction and for the director he really crafted a well made crime drama.The struggle Oscar Isaac has to go through to not turn into a thug and the mystery behind who is stealing these oil trucks was just fascinating. They really captured the immigrant seeking the American dream. In one scene Albert Brooks who plays the Andrew (who is also perfectly cast by the way) is walking with Abel behind one of the tanks and says I never knew about this view? As they look at the New York skyline in the distance. Abel says I did.It's subtlety but again a hint at that rise to the top almost reminiscent of Scarface when he sees the world is yours.I love this film and I'm going to enjoy watching this over again.",A Most Violent Year
194,indiglo_syd,Toughing it out in the heating-oil delivery wars of 20th C New York,9,20 January 2015,"This is a sombre, muted, melancholy revisiting of territory not too far removed from The Godfather. It's a highly moral, even intellectual take on the way business blurs into crime and back again. The pace is rather even so that it never shoots up into the stratosphere of a crime melodrama, but that's a deliberate choice. And one I came to appreciate as the story unfolded. It's the story of one man's struggle to say afloat amid a sea of troubles as difficulty piles upon difficulty. And that's where the capacity of the viewer to identify with this very specific time and place comes powerfully into play. I hope lots of people investigate the subtle pleasures of this minor-key masterpiece.",A Most Violent Year
195,lpquig,Slow Burn,8,21 November 2015,"This is a movie I often don't recommend to any of my friends because I truly feel it takes someone with a certain level of appreciation for film and the patience to watch this plot unfold. Now I don't mean for that to come off as snobbish, but this is a movie that could easily be cast off as boring by people who are just looking for an entertaining film. However, if you are a person who possess some level of appreciation for film and would like to see a good, albeit slow tale, I would highly recommend this movie.The first thing of note in this movie is Oscar Issac's performance. He plays Abel Morales, an entrepreneur who runs a fuel company. He is one of Hollywood's best rising stars, and he shows what he's got in this film. He gives a very subtle, even performance that is reflective of his character, and it works very well. Jessica Chastain is also very good as his wife, and her character's primary motivation is her children and their safety. I felt that she really cared about her kids.I don'y want to go too much into the story because it is a good one. But the fine details of the story is not what matters. It is the intricacy of the characters that is the important aspect of this film. To see how hard Abel will work for his family and his legacy shows the drive of man, and a sort of twisted sense of the American dream.",A Most Violent Year
196,sakleo8,A mundane storyline and a slow movie ! Ordinary at best.,3,29 March 2015,"Very Very Very Very slow. A 15 minute story stretched to more than 90 minutes. Not at all thrilling with hardly any drama. The acting is good, however unless you want to watch a very slow movie, give this a skip. It is one of the very few movies that have a rating above 7 on IMDb and in my humble opinion does not deserve it. Story line is nothing out of the ordinary and i would call it an ordinary movie. It is set in new york and the story is not something that would actually pique the interest of the audience and if it was not for the acting the movie would have been unwatchable. Its really a shame that the writer was not able to put in some more effort into making the story a little more exciting.People do not want to watch the mundane activities that are involved in running an business and that is what this movie forces upon you. Ordinary, mundane, badly directed. Scenes are stretched longer than necessary and that is what kills the movie. Having to watch a scene for 5 minutes when it could have been done in 2 minutes.",A Most Violent Year
197,bananaoftheyear,A real slow burner of a movie -,8,14 February 2015,"A Most Violent Year is something of a cross between The Godfather and Macbeth; it's about power, the corrupting influence of it and the constant need to attain more of it. But the film is also about the choices made along the way. Does having power matter if the road to getting it is littered with moral and ethical compromises? Oscar Isaac, looking more like a young Al Pacino than ever before, plays Abel Morales, a heating oil magnate in 1981 New York. It's the most violent year in the city's record and Abel is dealing with a dilemma. He's just put down a hefty deposit for a prime piece of land that will completely evolve his business, but the balance must be paid within 30 days or the deal is off and the down payment lost. However his trucks are being hijacked at an increasing clip and the drivers are looking to arm themselves, which would be illegal. Oh, and the District Attorney (David Oyelowo) is in the midst of dogged investigation into the business for possible violations.A Most Violent Year one of the best crime movies in recent memory. Ultimately it's a film about doing whatever it takes to survive without losing one's sense of self in the process. They don't make movies like this much anymore when they used to be commonplace. A Most Violent Year is truly a rare breed.",A Most Violent Year
198,jinuj,An underwhelming movie,5,30 June 2016,"This is one movie that I kept watching, hoping that it will really become something. But then it ended. I cursed, turned off the projector and went to sleep. The biggest issue is the lack of a compelling story. There are movies that take a slice of out of someone's life and make it compelling. I guess the writer's intentions were the same, but the end result feels like a bland unfinished meal. It is sometimes hard to go by IMDb ratings to select a movie to watch. I guess if you have enough friends to write glowing reviews, you can bring the ratings up to a point. Critics I guess try not to become lone wolves by toeing the most common critic denominator line and rate it above average. After all, its their job. They don't want to look outside the mainstream. So, I have no idea why it has 7.0 rating on IMDb, it should be a solid 6 for effort, cinematography and decent acting. Nothing more. Nothing less.",A Most Violent Year

THIS IS NOT A FILM ABOUT HIS BUILDING A BUSINESS. THAT IS THE BACKSTORY.This film is about the wife and her patience and tolerance of him trying to live in the real world. This film makes fun of his naïve attempt to live in a virtuous world. Her tolerance of his fantasy of real life virtue is continually tried (the deer, the ending) to such an extent that she must solve his problems as the real world hero by continually bailing him out. Just watch her face throughout the film. It is all about her and her amused tolerance of his folly.Watch the film again from her perspective... it is hilarious how in control she actually is while he is flopping around in his pontificating moments. EXCELLENT FILM",A Most Violent Year

I would question whether it actually belongs in the action/crime genre. There's a distinct lack of criminals (except the two hijackers) and I found Abel's remarkable restraint for someone whose business, house, family are being threatened to be slightly implausible. There's no explanation why all this is happening. Is there organized crime involved? And why this big criminal investigation? Its just not very clear and a few truck hijackings are not exactly a huge crime wave either. Yes, we get that 1981 was 'a most violent year' but maybe somebody who lived in New York at that time would understand its relevance. Everyone else though...",A Most Violent Year
202,e-24704,Ending makes the movie pointless,6,20 March 2015,"A Most Violent Year, is a well made movie, don't get me wrong. But what this movie lacks is an end game. It seems like if they put too much thought into this movie, that when filming, they realized that something was completely wrong. In so they just shoved so many things into a bucket, and told us that was the end. So here's the ending: As Abel Morales struggles to earn enough money, last second his wife suddenly says that she has enough money; making the entire movie pointless. Oh and after they buy the new factory, remember the driver that was gone most of the movie, well he's back and very depressed. So of course he threatens his former boss and shoots himself.

So is the photography. As expected, everybody acted just fine. But was there any moment worth remembering or cherish? I honestly can't remember. Are the obstacles significant than other people face? Nope. Hence, I didn't feel like it was a great decision to make the movie. With actors like Isaac, Chastain and Brooks, it had so much potentials. Without question the ability of Chandor, I would say that some factors were missing, the factor that would make the movie special, make the lead stand out. But it wasn't there.It's forgettable just like numerous other mediocre films basted on 'true story'. You can check it out for once though. Because Oscar Isaac looks his best.",A Most Violent Year

It's beautiful, it looks like it belongs, giving a modern take of filmmaking in a time where everything looks daft to us now, and the performances, directing, cinematography and especially the tone were all stellar.Why do I still think it's not a great movie? Because while it gripped me at times, it's always for the anticipation of resolving the question of ""so what?"".The movie never answers that question, it never goes out of it's way to establish what it all meant, what the point was. Is it a character study? Well, then it's a pointless one, because other than Oscar Isaac being the most perfect American ever portrayed on screen, I can't see why we should relate to his struggles, because he only has external ones, not internal. And the external don't comment on their own existence and make a point about a crooked system that promises a dream that can be realized, but solely exist for the character to struggle with. Again pointless.It's so muddled up that what the film was trying to do gets lost. Is it a realistic portrayal of the American dream succeding despite the promise being broken? Is it about the struggle within to do the right thing? Is it about going forward no matter what? Is it about love and partnership and trusting each other?There is no clear yes or no to these questions, and for some people that may be alright. I found that it made me feel that the creative team didn't know what it was about and failed to show it. And if they couldn't bothered to think what it was about, why should I?",A Most Violent Year

Honestly, the plot devices and conveniences are like they've been written by a (profanity removal) 12 year old. I feel as if the director didn't make this or his inner 12 year old allowed the script.

And it comes to such a surprise to him that other mobsters are not willing to go down with his sinking ship and would rather protect themselves and their business.

208,devlam,The Least Violent Year,2,12 February 2015,"Basically its all for nothing, story for stories sake. The whole time your waiting for the violence, yet the worst violence happens when Jessica Chastains character shoots a deer in the head. Despite the fact the film was incredibly slow all the way through, the production value, wardrobe, and acting stood out over a terrible script and narrative to work with. The film follows the protagonists search for $1.5mil to fund an estate of an oil factory. He has 1 month and a further three days to produce said funds to his Jewish associates, otherwise it will be sold to his competitors. CUE THE MOST VIOLENT MONTH! He's constantly having his oil pinched from the 'MAFIA' which turn out to be the least violent members of the mafia ever, in fact it's like the mafia even rang and said we will not be associated with this movie. You could probably get more violence out of a slug on Ritalin moving as slow as the plot. They still manage to snatch his oil and are finally chased down by our protagonist. He beats a 'thug' to a pulp and asked the usual ""who are you working for?"" takes a backstep lets him go and he tells him anyway. Our lead approaches his not mentioned before brother and tells him he's mortgaged his house for $200,000, a scene that is as random as a cloud getting high on flower ranging. It all just happens and for no apparent reason. Plus, in addition to selling part of his company to a lady and her grandad for a loan of $500 grand, when hoping for $1.5mil, the protagonists uses his thug victims information to take back the money from his $200 grand worth of stolen oil. This eliminates any point of the film so far. The rest of the story turns out to be a pointless endeavour because Jessica Chastain has skimmed accumulated $600 grand from the company all along. OH and not forgetting the mob boss and his obsession with tennis, that was going to loan him the money anyway. Don't give me your pretentious bullshit, i know a good movie when i see one.This was like some one went 'hey i wanna write a movie in this genre' and someone produced funds they had all along and let them do it.",A Most Violent Year
209,leary-chris,"Allegory about Americans who are in a ""State of Denial""",9,9 August 2015,"This whole movie is a big misdirection and that's what I love about it. Abel, the ""hero,"" is actually a stooge for the mafia, and he can't even admit it to himself, despite all the evidence piling up.Let's recap how Abel, this ""amazing businessman,"" becomes dominant in the oil industry. Purportedly, Abel has this incredible sales technique where you hold the customer's gaze for an uncomfortable amount of time. This is what he does when he is trying to get people to switch to his company. And this is how he trains his new employees. It's seriously all he tells his new employees: ""Look the customer in the eye for a length of time that grows uncomfortable."" That's it. And it works. Hmmm... Could people be switching to his company for a different reason? Perhaps they are being strong-armed by Abel's in-laws? The mafia? When Abel tries to tell his wife that the company has grown in a wholesome, ethical manner, his wife can hardly keep a straight face. She starts to say, ""You think you did this on your own?"" but thinks better of it, because it's smart business to have this clueless dope as the public face of the business. (On the other hand, what's it like to have a clueless dope as your husband? A question for another review.)The real plot of this movie happens ""offstage"" and you have to pay extra attention to Jessica Chastain's character in order to realize what's really happening. For instance, when the oil company is in a huge jam, Chastain's character mysteriously comes up with 750k, and Abel barely questions where it came from.My reading of Abel as a clueless dope opens up the possibility to read the movie as an allegory about Americans. Americans, like myself, are in a state of denial about where our success (and oil) comes from. We tell ourselves that we are the wealthiest nation on Earth because of our values: home of free, land of brave, so on, so forth. But we are like Abel, the clueless dopes providing the wholesome public face, while violent military tactics do the real work. We refuse to admit to ourselves that our success is enforced by a global military network that ruthlessly protects our economic interests. It's better not to tell us what's really going on, because then we wouldn't be able to play our role as well.",A Most Violent Year

This film takes a story that could easily have turned into the cliché gangster flick and turns it inside out, with a more grounded and relatable approach. The story is fascinating, the dialogue rich, and the acting is spectacular. Oscar Isaac hits it out of the park in this film and the supporting cast is just as good.

And no, she wasn't going to tell him until the final ten minutes of the movie.I found this ridiculous and certainly not very realistic.

The story is also great, not falling into typical gangster styled lines. I don't know if this is a real life story, but surely the doubt comes from finding so much realistic and not exaggerated details together with a great acting from the characters.

Its a used car salesman who sells you that sweet ride and is yelling ""all sales are final"" as it breaks down outside of the lot.This is billed as a gangster movie. Its not. Its far from it. The main character doesn't do anything that would REMOTELY be qualified as a ""gangster"". Its title leads you to believe its ""violent"". Its not.

When deciding to watch this movie, due to the title and genre, I expected to see your typical crime movie filled with lots of action, crime bosses, rivals, shootings, corruption and just plain violence. Instead the only violence and action I saw was a woman shooting a deer, a few foot chases that led up to nothing and 1 brief shooting scene. I so patiently waited for this movie to pick up, but to my disappointment it never did. There were too many odd scenes that left many unanswered questions such as: who was the guy outside the house? Who was he and why was he there? Why were the people robbing his trucks to begin with, seeing as though they weren't working for a rival or competitor or anyone for that matter? Why were the police really trying to build a case against him? Why was the boss running around town asking any Tom or Jerry for a loan to buy a building?
