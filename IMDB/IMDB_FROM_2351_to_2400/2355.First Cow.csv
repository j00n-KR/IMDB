0,SnoopyStyle,deliberately quiet,6,6 June 2021,"In present day, a woman finds a shallow grave with two skeletons. In the 1820's, Cookie (John Magaro) is a meek cook traveling with a group of rough fur trappers going to the Oregon territories. He finds naked Chinese immigrant King-Lu (Orion Lee) hiding from Russians after killing one of them. He helps King-Lu to hide as the group reaches their destination. The big local news is that the Chief Factor (Toby Jones) has received the first cow in the region which he needs for milk in his tea. Cookie and King-Lu conceive a new business if they can steal milk during the night.The story is a bit quirky although it's not actually laugh out loud funny. Right from the start, it's a bit weird with naked King-Lu. I was wondering if this was going for a gay love story but it never goes there. Cookie is such a quiet character that he doesn't have the energy to drive the narrative. The cow is an interesting idea and this is a deliberately quiet movie. It just may be not going to be everyone's taste.",First Cow
1,nogodnomasters,History moves more quickly in Paris,3,4 October 2020,Plot Spoilers. Cookie (John Magaro) is a cook who has found himself in Oregon working for trappers who don't like him. He helps an immigrant in trouble. Later they meet at the fort and become friends. They steal milk from a neighbors cow and cook biscuits with it that they sell at the fort. They get caught and leave. The ending ties into the opening which was typical indie film clever. I was bored and kept waiting for something to happen. Long boring scenes opening with a boat going down river.,First Cow
2,classicsoncall,"""It would appear that someone's been milking your cow.""",6,31 October 2020,"I appreciate the thoughtful reviews of those who found value to this movie, but for this viewer it was a trying experience. It's very dark in terms of lighting, as some pivotal scenes are virtually impossible to see. There's a huge disconnect with the way the story opens and what it's eventually all about, so don't go looking for continuity there. The principal characters, once things settle down, are an immigrant fur trapper (John Magaro) and a Chinese wayfarer (Orion Lee) who hook up by accident, and with no other resources available to them, decide to team up to make a go of it in the 1820's Oregon wilderness. The title of the picture directly relates to the introduction of a cow into the territory by a wealthy trader, and it's jarring each time it's mentioned that the animal lost her 'husband' on the trip over from England. Who talks like that?Essentially, Otis 'Cookie' Figowitz (Magaro) and King Lu (Lee) team up in an enterprise of surreptitiously stealing milk from Chief Factor's (Toby Jones) prize cow and using it as an ingredient in making baked goods that they trade for money at the local fort. This worthwhile venture into capitalism is disrupted when one night, Factor's servant discovers their endeavor, and the chase begins to hunt down the malefactors. Separated while on the run, the pair eventually team up again down river, and the story ends abruptly when the injured Cookie requires some rest and both men fall asleep in the woods. At that point the end credits roll, and the sequel to the movie is left to the viewer's imagination.If you've never heard of a clafoutis, you'll learn at least one thing watching the movie. And if you don't, no use crying over spilt milk.",First Cow
3,Quinoa1984,Kelly Reichardt's film is another in a line of carefully paced studies of humanity,8,28 August 2020,"It may be because of how I watched this - First Cow and Reichardt's films in general call for seeing it in a cinema if at all possible, she simply has that eye and ear for the minutest details and for the time she takes with every shot and many scenes to draw out the feeling of a place as well as for the actors to settle in, that you want to sink in to this film as a sensory experience, and instead I saw it at home where (I don't know about you but) I have too many distractions, not least of which the phone on a busy weekday - but it took me about fifteen to twenty minutes or so to get into the mood of this film. I wasn't sure if it might go anywhere really, as it follows the Cookie character as he is part of this fur trapping outfit (or almost on the outside, just barely with it, but enough to be in it without, say, getting into scraps/fights like the others), and it was frankly slow-going.But then the story, as much as it is, kicks in and it becomes this very simple tale of a friendship and what may be a fairly minor crime in the grand scheme of things - taking milk from a cow that isn't there's so they can make oily cakes, basically the 1820's rural Oregon equivalent of what I assume is Krispy Kreme - and how it gets tested and firms as they become more successful and gain the employ of the wealthiest man in the area (Toby Jones), who... also happens to own the cow that they've been milking. It's so engrossing because of its simplicity, the delicacy and yet the immediacy of the world that Reichardt has recreated for us. Like all the best period filmmakers, she and her collaborators bring this part of America/the Pacific North-west to life in almost a humble sort of way: it isn't ostentatious, it's just... what it was, and that makes it special.Aside from the performances themselves from these two, I have to wonder if the power of this film comes from something that maybe Reichardt was conscious of or maybe she wasn't, but this story makes me think about filmmaking itself, especially of the independent kind (or art creation in general). You have to assemble the right ingredients, and it most often takes some tenacity for it to all come together like it should (and how many times have you heard of someone on an indie movie shoot ""going guerilla"" or ""stealing a shot"" from some such and such a location they didn't have a permit for, etc). It feels like a story that Reichardt has lived at some point in her life, and she gets to deepen on the themes she worked in on Old Joy, also about a male friendship that gets tested by cirumstance.And what's fascinating is how because of the slow-burn-ness of the pacing, by the time it gets to the last half hour or final quarter, it has some real suspense as we wonder how our two great lawbreakers will get out of this as they get hunted down. It's not quite to the same level of poetic grungy-frontier depiction heights as a McCabe & Mrs. Miller, but it has that same looseness and understanding about humanity, and if anything is less pessimistic about equality between people of different backgrounds and races. What happens after the end credits start to roll? I don't know, and I don't need to is the point - they've gotten through some s***, and they're together.",First Cow
4,CinemaSerf,A bit of a milky bromance...,7,14 September 2021,"This is a gently comedic story of a couple of pioneering Oregon frontiersmen. Cook-cum-baker John Magaro (""Cookie"") who falls in with the entrepreneurial ""King-Lu"" (Orion Lee). The pair quickly realise that there is a decent amount of money to be made by indulging the sweet teeth of their fellow hardy companions - and when they discover that the local headman has had a cow delivered - the only one for miles - a clandestine business that involves purloining the milk from said cow to enhance their cakes offers riches, but some risk too - the factor (Toby Jones) is unaware that his is, technically, the manna from which these delicious sweets are being made. What follows is a little bit predictable, but nonetheless enjoyable to watch as they try to stay one step ahead of their increasingly cognisant boss. Director Kelly Reichardt takes her time to introduce us to the pair, and to let the story develop gently and entertainingly whilst still offering us a plausible glimpse of the harsh and tough living conditions experienced by these folks in search of everything from gold to land to, well, milk! It's got quite a pleasingly complementary score from William Tyler and is certainly worth a watch - though it doesn't need to be on a big screen.",First Cow
5,evanston_dad,Outcasts in the American Frontier,8,18 November 2020,"A story about two outcasts who find friendship and a business partnership with each other in the American frontier.John Magaro plays a gentle baker who begins the movie as cook for a prospecting expedition. He's too thoughtful and sensitive to really fit in with the macho wild men he's with, who bully and threaten him. Orion Lee is a Chinese immigrant who befriends him and suggests that they go into business selling the baker's biscuits at a local trading post. The biscuits are a sensation, but the enterprise is a dangerous one -- the only place to get milk is to steal it from the cow (yes, THE cow, not A cow) that belongs to the local aristocrat, played by the always welcome Toby Jones. The film begins in the present day with a hiker in the woods discovering something that hints at how the movie will end, and how the movie then circles back to that find is a small miracle of narrative storytelling.Kelly Reichardt, who's made a career of quiet, understated films, remains true to form here. ""First Cow"" shows much more than it tells, which should please fans of art house fare but will probably frustrate more casual moviegoers who have less patience for the way stories are told. The two main characters don't talk much, but we learn much about them, not from what they say, but from how they act. The first time we see Magaro's character, for example, he's hunting for mushrooms in the woods, and he takes the time to set a salamander he finds back on its feet when it's struggling to flip itself over. And when Lee's character shows him to his cabin in the woods, the first thing Magaro does is find some wildflowers with which to decorate the small space. Little flourishes like these reward the patient viewer, and we come to like the two men so much that the end, though we've been warned of it in advance, feels that much more tragic when it comes.Covid has seen to it that 2020 hasn't exactly been the most robust year for movies, but of movies that have been released so far this year, ""First Cow"" is one of the best I've seen.Grade: A",First Cow
6,ferguson-6,what came before,8,19 December 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. A modern-era woman (Alia Shawkat) is hiking along an Oregon river with her trusty dog. Something catches her eye and she begins tentatively brushing away decades of leaves and soot. Ultimately it turns into an excavation of two human skeletons nestled together. How many years since these two laid down for the last time? Why in this spot? It's a terrific way to begin a story, and does justice to what follows ... all of which takes place in the early 19th century.Director Kelly Reichardt has already made her mark with such standouts as CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), MEEK'S CUTOFF (2010), and WENDY AND LUCY (2008), and this time she adapts the screenplay with Jonathan Raymond from his 2004 novel, ""The Half-Life"". Cookie (John Magaro, also seen in this year's SYLVIE'S LOVE) is initially seen traveling west with a band of trappers. Skirting the law as they make their way in this new world, the men act as bullying brutes towards Cookie, a quiet and sensitive man. During one stop for camp, Cookie is rummaging the brush for food when he stumbles upon a naked Chinese man who is hungry and running from Russians (aren't we all?). Cookie provides King-Lu (played by Orion Lee) with food and shelter, a Golden Rule act that comes full circle not long thereafter.Cookie and King-Lu begin establishing something more than a friendship. It's a life bond (but probably not in the way you might be thinking). It's more natural instinct - a 'two heads are better than one' partnership. Despite the hardships of early frontier days, the two men share their version of the American Dream, and it's about this time that our titular bovine makes her entry stage left. The cow belongs to Chief Factor (Toby Jones) who is eager to create a more refined life in this untamed wilderness. Cookie views the cow's milk as the key to creating tasty biscuits (a rare treat), and King-Lu immediately recognizes the possibility of profit. The nightly heist features Cookie's one-directional conversation with Evie the cow ... presumably making her first screen appearance.Ms. Reichardt's film is not nearly as simple or slow moving as it appears. She fills it with a slow-build tension, especially in the second half. The film requires patience and attention to detail from viewers. How can something so quiet and peaceful be filled with such danger and difficulty? That's the brilliance of the film. Supporting work is provided by Scott Shepherd as a military officer Factor tries to impress, the late Rene Auberjonois (whose presence seems a tip of the cap to Altman's classic MCCABE AND MRS MILLER), Ewan Bremner (whose accent requires subtitles for comprehension), and Lily Gladstone as Factor's Native American wife.This is the first film I recall where a clarfoutis plays a key role, and there are sprinkles of dark comedy throughout ... which plays well off the rugged characters and environment. William Tyler's score and Christopher Blauvelt's cinematographer mesh well with the fine performances throughout. Ms. Reichardt opens the film with a William Black quote, ""The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship"". We witness the friendship, and by the end, we wonder if it's also a web.

7,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - First Cow (2019) 8.0/10,8,3 August 2020,"""The usual undersides of the frontier life, incivility, fisticuffs, treachery, barbarity, malevolence, etc., all transpire in the story, but either on the sidelines (a disgruntled old man with a raven on his shoulder, played by the recently departed Auberjonois, for instance, whose wanton menace never comes to fruition) or in the murkiness (the uncouth trappers' bellyaching), or completely off-screen, like its sublime ending, where Reichardt tentatively intimates us the one who would end both Cookie and King-lu's lives, but she tactfully saves us from witness the gory and cruelty by simply leaving it in omission, instead, focusing on the tender, amicable, wordless moments precede that, especially when King-lu fleetingly contemplates whether to leave a wounded Cookie alone in the woods, before thinks better of it and decides to stay with his pal, come hell or high water.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",First Cow
8,MOscarbradley,Reichardt's most accesible film to date.,8,20 December 2020,"Kelly Reichardt doesn't make movies that move or if they do, they move very, very slowly and ""First Cow"" is no exception, (it has just won the New York Film Critic's Best Picture of 2020). It begins in the present day before moving back in time to the Oregon of the Old West where a cook to a bunch of trappers and a Chinese immigrant he meets hiding in the forest strike up an unlikely friendship before going into business together making cakes with milk which they steal from the cow of the title.This is an art-house western and no mistake, moving at a pace that makes Terrence Malick seem like an action director, (did we really think it would be otherwise?). Of course, you could say that Reichardt, who shoots the film in Academy Ratio, gives us the truest picture of life in the West since Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", though Reichardt doesn't go in for 'star' names, (the nearest we get to 'stars' here are Toby Jones, Ewen Bremner, Scott Shepherd and Rene Auberjonois in his last film role). The cook is John Magaro and the Chinese man is Orion Lee and you will be forgiven if you haven't heard of either of them. and yet for all it realist trappings it often feels like 21st Century people playing at being cowboys. That said, and despite its funereal pace, this is a western like no other, (it's certainly the most original since Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man""). Of course, you might also be surprised that a movie like this is being tipped for Oscar glory but then, 2020 has been a year unlike any other and it's independent movies like this that are stealing the limelight. It's also Reichardt's most accessible film to date.",First Cow
9,gbill-74877,Quietly brilliant,9,5 October 2021,"""It's the getting started that's the puzzle. No way for a poor man to start. ... You need capital, or you need some kind of miracle.""
""You need leverage.""
""Or a crime.""Another excellent Western from Kelly Reichardt, one with high production quality and which quietly subverts the genre's traditional themes. That starts with the two protagonists, King-Lu and Cookie (Orion Lee and John Magaro) who are rational, somewhat timid guys who hit on a plan to make a fortune via baked goods (yes, baked goods). Cookie is quite the domestic for the hero of a Western, and can crank out a clafoutis if necessary. The buddy he meets, King-Lu, is from China but is the antithesis of stereotypical representations, having traveled the world and multi-lingual, including English and the local Native American dialect. How fantastic is it that these guys aren't macho gunslingers, that they cook, sew, sweep the house, and forage while trying to figure out how to take advantage of this ""land of riches."" Meanwhile, the Native Americans themselves aren't blood-thirsty savages, they're people and they co-exist with the colonizers, which is reasonably accurate for the 1820's, a few decades before mass colonization would lead to genocide.Despite the relative harmony, there is a quiet, rather ominous danger everywhere, from a bully in the fur trapping group promising to wait outside the fort after Cookie is paid to rob him, to King Lu describing how his friend was gutted from neck to loin because he was suspected of being a thief, to the more powerful men who debate how many lashes are appropriate in corporal punishment which is clearly at their discretion. There is no real law and order here, just force, and might makes right. At the same time, Reichardt is incredibly restrained in not showing a lot of violence, or reveling in it as a lesser director might have done.Meanwhile, the message comes through that the West wasn't won with frontier spirit or some other aspect of mythical American exceptionalism, it was won with crime. Sure, the two mild-mannered fellas with big dreams steal milk from a rich guy's cow to make some delicious oily cakes, setting up a pop-up food stall (ok food blanket) that's quite popular with the locals, enriching themselves in the process. But the rich guy is stealing resources from the Native Americans and idiotically believes that the beaver can be trapped without limit. When he's told by King-Lu how vast the original beaver population was in the state, he can't extrapolate what greed will do to the population eventually, or doesn't want to (and indeed, the beaver was almost driven to extinction in Oregon). The little thieves end up in shallow graves, the big thief ends up likely lauded in the state's history, with a town probably named after him.The first cow (fantastically played by Evie the cow btw) is thus a symbol of the natural order shifting, and in a profound way. Early on in a small saloon, one man remarks ""This ain't a place for cows. God would've put cows here if it was."" Another replies ""No place for white men either then."" It's notable that the cow is there so a rich man can have cream in his tea, and so he can display his status and sophistication to visitors who might look down on his rustic surroundings. It's a luxury, and reserved for him alone. It's the tip of an enormous iceberg, of many more white men with their precious possessions, of a lifestyle that will ravage the environment for the sake of personal wealth. In the opening shot in the present day, an enormous (and very ugly) cargo barge is seen going down the river. It's a shot I almost forgot by the time the film ended, but it seems to show in a subtle way the result of 200 years of such a lifestyle.That's an aspect of Reichardt's direction I admire most, just how much she holds back and lets the viewer think about. There is a powerful message here, but it's delivered with great subtlety. Most of the scenes are played without a soundtrack in the background, and she doesn't feel a need to include shots to fill everything in for the viewer. There were places where I felt the film could have moved along a little more quickly and it won't be for everyone, but the more I thought about it afterwards, the more I appreciated what she had done.",First Cow
10,Cineanalyst,Bare-Bones Storytelling,7,8 August 2021,"""First Cow"" is slow, quiet and mostly uneventful--milking many little moments far longer than in more mainstream fare, but it won me over in the end. That's not so much for the male leads from different backgrounds bonding in the Oregon territory c. 1820, nor for whatever one might wax poetic for over a simple indie flick. The scenery is nice, the cinematography is sometimes well framed, including through a window here or a mirror there, and the 4:3 aspect ratio seems inconsequential. The story finally gets going when the two start stealing milk of the titular first cow in the forted area. Forget all of that, though--or don't, rather, as there's not a lot here to keep track of--this is a movie buried in a pun.The introductory, framing story features the discovery of literal bare bones, and the main narrative is figuratively bare bones. Get it? This is also from the director, Kelly Reichardt, who previously had us follow around a woman and a dog doing not much of anything for an entire feature, ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008), so that another woman and dog pair discover the bones here is a neat self-reference. And, lest you doubt the intent there, note that the first lead is named ""Cookie,"" which reflects not only that he's a cook, but that from the stolen cow's milk, he makes cookies, or as American and British English were in the process of diverging at the time, what may also be known as biscuits, or cakes for further obfuscation. Indeed, the recipe for them seems to become more intricate over the days, which coincides appropriately enough with their attempts to conceal the food's secret, stolen ingredient.The main ingredient of the picture, though, is the skeletons pun. I've started tagging movies that use this very rhetorical device, as the inference is that film itself is a kind of death, of a series of still images taken from life and brought back as ghosts. Life, death, reanimation. It's a more common allusion than one might suspect and goes all the way back to the earliest drawings for moving magic lantern slides, of Christiaan Huygens's 1659 sketch of Death removing its skull, to the sliding serial images of a dancing skeleton some two hundred years later for Beale's Choreutoscope, and the Lumière marionette film of the so-called ""Merry Skeleton"" (1898). I don't recall having ever seen the entire main narrative framed through skeletal remains, though. Not a meaty story, but that sure is a firm framework.",First Cow
11,westsideschl,Hopes Squashed,3,3 November 2020,"I was hoping for an intelligent Native backed story of interactions with settlers, miners, etc., but the story and acting were just not believable with no focus.

12,ops-52535,a lonely royal cow,6,14 July 2020,"The story are from the wildfrontier in the west, among hunters and scavengers in oregon, where the taste of milk is like the taste of gold. and those who owe the milk can bake a wide variety of buns and cakes, steal the spilled milk, and make a fortune on empty stomachs.its a slow story and its very very dark in its visual presentation, so use darkness when viewing. the filmo and scenic additional photo are lovcely, the acting gears up as toby jones enters the screen otherwise cast and extras work like on a modern day norwegian viking camp at bukkøynå on augvaldsnes karmøy,norway.the most actionlike are the milkstealing, the darkness and the final hunt. it has something stuttering vibes over it, maybe its the lack of white female that lacks from the plot. anyway, the grumpy old man do recommend even though its compressed and slow.",First Cow
13,eddie_baggins,A quiet little film that had more too give,5,25 November 2020,"If you've ever seen a Kelly Reichardt film you know the well-regarded director is in no rush to get her audience anywhere fast or in particular, as she instead lets her camera linger on her characters and setting, well and truly the less is more approach to narrative storytelling.Since her debut with 1994 effort River of Grass, Reichardt has steadily plowed away across her career with character driven dramas that will either have the audience in a trance like state of anticipation or others struggling to stay awake as things ever so slowly transpire in front of their eyes.With her newest effort First Cow, Reichardt doesn't change her style in the slightest in adapting Jonathan Raymond's book, as we follow John Magaro's Cookie and his new business partner King-Lu (played by the films MVP Orion Lee) deep in the woods of the early American Oregon frontier where they search for fortune but settle for a small-scale business venture that sees them stealing milk from the areas sole cow.The film feels and and breathes like its from the era it is set in, there's no flashy Hollywood style over substance here, this is a muddy and lived-in woodlands set tale that is further enhanced by Reichardt's stoic directing and 4:3 aspect ratio but while its alive in this sense of time and place, there's very little energy or enthusiasm coming from its tale or characters that feel as though they had a lot more to give.There's nothing wrong with small and intimate character study's that act as metaphors to much larger explorations of the human condition and our history but First Cow constantly feels as though its beggining to be something more, something that never eventuates, never more so evident than in the relationship between Cookie and King-Lu as friends and business associates with Magaro and Lee doing fine work but finding themselves unable to escape the shackles of a film that doesn't let them fly free.It's a hard film to hate, you can sense that Reichardt and her crew poured their love into this A24 distributed drama (one that I'm sure they will be promoting come awards season) but there's not a lot to love here as our central friendships, characters and story slowly plod along to a destination that never eventuates into a finale that makes it all truly worth your while.Final Say -A sure-fire hit with Reichardt fans, First Cow continues on with the form and product that has made her name but this snail-paced drama feels as though it had more to give with a bunch of colorful characters and situations that feel only half-explored.2 1/2 broken branches out of 5",First Cow
14,howard.schumann,A haunting tribute to intimacy and friendship,10,28 July 2020,"Kelly Reichardt's (""Certain Women"") First Cow is a song to nature, a tribute to intimacy and friendship, and a solid rebuke to Hollywood's image of the gung-ho masculinity of the Old West. As the director laments, ""The heroism of masculinity, white masculinity, it never dies. It just doesn't die, that image in filmmaking always gets a roar of applause."" In First Cow, however, Reichardt quietly explores a male friendship that is built upon kindness and mutual acceptance and offers a vision of an American dream not yet corrupted by self-interest or exploitation.Based on the 2004 novel ""The Half-Life"" by Jonathan Raymond (""Night Moves"") and adapted by Raymond and Reichardt, First Cow is set on the Oregon frontier sometime in the early 1800s. Shot in a boxy 4:3 ratio similar to the Westerns of the 1950s, the cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt (""Meek's Cutoff"") and a haunting score by William Tyler reveals the pristine beauty of the Oregon wilderness as well as the primitive conditions in which most trappers and explorers lived. At the beginning of the film, a quote from poet William Blake, ""The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship"" sets the tone as the opening shot introduces us to a barge slowly making its way down the Columbia River, which is where the story takes place.In a brief prologue set in the present, a young woman (Alia Shawkat, ""Izzy Gets the F*ck Across Town""), out walking with her dog, discovers a human skull partially buried in the dirt. Upon digging, she uncovers the skeletons of two men holding hands. Without further explanation, the scene then shifts to the beginning of the nineteenth century as Otis ""Cookie"" Figowitz (John Magaro, ""Overlord""), a cook for a team of trappers at the Royal West Pacific Trading Post discovers King-Lu (Orion Lee, ""Only You""), a Chinese immigrant hiding naked in the woods. After providing the fugitive with clothes and shelter, we learn that Cookie is from Maryland where his mother died when he was born, and his father died shortly after and he's been on the road ever since.King-Lu is from northern China and claims that he is running away from the Russians who are seeking to revenge the killing of one of their own. After some time has passed, the two men find each other again inside a bar at the trading post and develop a close, if unlikely friendship. When they witness the arrival of a cow with huge, soft eyes (the breakout star of the film) that belongs to wealthy landowner Chief Factor (Toby Jones, ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom""), King-Lu devises a scheme to secretly milk the cow late at night and use her milk to bake honey-covered biscuits which they market to the occupants of the settlement, starved for anything that reminds them of home. Chief Factor noticeably remarks when biting into one of the biscuits, ""I taste London.""The enterprise is successful and perhaps is reflective of the idea that a successful commercial venture in our society requires a certain degree of larceny. This notion is reinforced by King-Lu who proclaims that, ""We have to take what we can when the taking is good."" His plan is to accumulate enough money to go to San Francisco and set up a business while Cookie dreams of opening a hotel for travelers and a bakery. When Cookie is persuaded by Chief Factor to bake a ""Blueberry Clafoutis,"" a special British desert to impress a visiting Captain (Scott Shepherd, ""X-Men: Dark Phoenix""), Factor discovers that the dish requires milk and, in perfect Sherlock Holmes fashion, puts two and two together, sending Cookie and King-Lu on the run for safety.Like most of Reichardt's films, First Cow requires patience and a willingness to explore character development at the expense of a fast-paced narrative. While the film is not religious, the presence of spirit is felt in its journey among the rivers, the woods, and mountains of the Pacific Northwest, and in a narrative attentive to mankind's need for friendship. In Reichardt's 2006 film, ""Old Joy,"" one of the characters shares an old Chinese proverb that ""sorrow is nothing but worn-out joy."" While our society is often permeated by the sense that our joy is wearing out and that we are in danger of losing our connection to other human beings, Reichardt's sensitive and haunting film renews our understanding of the deep and abiding companionship we can still share with each other - in moments of beauty and tragedy,in an age that feels closer to the end than the beginning.",First Cow

16,paul-allaer,Spellbinding 19th century survival drama on the Oregon Frontier,8,11 November 2020,"""First Cow"" (2019 release; 122 min.) brings the story of Cookie and Lu, two pioneers in the Oregon Frontier. As the movie opens, we are today, and a woman is taking a walk in the woods. Her dog inadvertently discovers the remains of not one, but two human skeletons... We then go back in time to the early 19th century. A guy named Cookie is harvesting mushrooms and bumps into a Chinese guy named Lu. They strike up a friendship... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Kelly Reichardt, whose previous work includes the excellent ""Meek's Cutoff"" and ""Wendy and Lucy"". Here she adapts the novel ""The Half-Life"" for the big screen. I have not read the book and hence cannot comment on how closely firm film sticks to the book. What I can tell you is this: ""First Cow"" is a spellbinding look at what life was like on the Oregon Frontier in the early 19th century: a slow pace of life, very rural/brutal/harsh living conditions, lots of poverty, and famine. Get the picture? This ain't for the meek or the weak! It feels as if nothing much happens in the film in the first hour, as we simply get to understand the context of these lives. But then in the film's second hour, we understand which direction this is going, and it all becomes spellbinding, but certainly not for anyone in a hurry. Two technical aspects were striking: one, the photography (in a rather unusual 4;3 picture ratio, instead of the typical 16:9 ratio) is stunning. Each and every frame has a purpose. Two, the film's score, even though only incidental, is absolutely outstanding, courtesy of guitarist William Tyler. Last but not least, kudos for the lead performances by John Magaro (as Cookie) and Orion Lee (as Lu).""First Cow"" premiered to immediate critical acclaim at the 2019 Telluride Film Festival (16 months ago), in what now feels like a different era altogether. It was released in theaters literally the week before COVID-19 struck. I had seen the trailer at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati but the film never made it here, sadly. The movie is now available on SHO On Demand (where I saw it earlier this week) and other streaming services. If you are in the mood for a top-notch indie movie about life out on the Oregon Frontier back in the 1820s, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusions.",First Cow

Cookie, played by John Magaro, is attached to a skinning outfit but due to the scarcity of game, he has to make do w/what he can find which angers his party to no end. During one of his scavenging runs, he comes across an erudite Chinese man, played by Orion Lee, who's hiding out from some Russians who are after him so Cookie does the humane thing & hides him until the threat passes. Once they reach a settlement, Magaro drifts around but in a fit of serendipitous luck runs into Lee & through sheer gumption decide to make sweet muffins or as they call it ""oily cakes"" to sell to a hungry populace who buy them as fast as they make them but their success is hindered by a secret; they're stealing the milk to make the cakes from the only cow in the area owned by a wealthy businessman, played by Toby Jones, who just so happens to love their product so much he commissions a special dish when some influential guests come to dine at his home. Instead of possibly saving up money to buy their own cow or at the very least play their theft by ear, they continue to skirt their own safety ultimately getting caught & chased into the hills being pursued by Jones' men (one of which is played Ewen Bremner of Trainspotting fame). Slight but colorful in the extreme, this effort is of a piece w/all of Reichardt's work which tend to be regional (her films usually take place in the Pacific Northwest) but given the fact no one else is doing what she's doing (maybe Debra Granik (Winter's Bone/Leave No Trace) can stake a claim since her films kind of skew towards landscape melodramas as well), she's kind of cornered the market by delightful default.

23,jadepietro,Traditional American Cuisine,6,18 December 2020,"IN BRIEF: Highly atmospheric but sluggish character study of a frontier bromance, a cow, and the American Dream.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) First Cow is an independent film that celebrates friendship, capitalism, and the American Dream. Set in Oregon Country, circa early 1800, the film is all atmosphere, with minimal dialog and even less action. It is leisurely filmed as it tells its simple tale about two enterprising drifters who try to turn their hard luck into a lucrative business proposition.John Magaro plays Cookie, a baker who may have qualified for Top Chef Frontier Edition, and Orion Lee is his Chinese immigrant friend, King-Lu. The actors are quite good and create a nice bond. Solidly directed by Kelly Reichardt, the movie is written by the director and Richard Raymond and they do provide some fine conversational interludes when prompted. Ms. Reichardt creates a strong character study of two idealistic men wanting more than they are able to achieve and convey their eagerness with some lyrical imagery of a bygone era, reminiscent of Robert Altman's western, McCabe and Mrs. Miller. William Tyler supplies a melancholy guitar-strumming score than adds to the sensitive handling of this movie.But the film is so slowly paced, it could be a movie still. Not much happens in the first 45 minutes until their scheme (involving dear Elsie) takes flight. (Actually, First Fritter may have been a better title. Let's just say...imagine the townsfolk's reactions if our gourmet duo had invented a quiche or a crepe back in those days. Bon appétit!)First Cow would have been a terrific short film, but stretching it out to 3 times its length made this an excruciating journey for me. Its visual look impresses, but it is basically an exercise of style over substance that bores rather than soars. (I must said that I am in a minority with my review, as many critics have surprisingly named this movie on many of their best films list for 2020.). I found the film to be overrated, but well made; a appetizing presentation if slightly undercooked with too many large portions of dull. I just expected more. Waiter...check, s'il vous plaît!

We had two unlikely friends joined together in an ambition to realise their dreams in a time when this was nearly impossible.Unfortunately this ambitious dream rested on the petty theft of a neighbours milk from the only cow in the territory.This was a slow gentle story that made the pairs friendship the central focus, I was entirely convinced by the brotherly love that underpinned this rather unhappy story. I thought the acting was great, it was subtle yet comprehensive. Cookie play by John Magaro was first rate.This movie was a slow burn and not for everyone, no car chase here!, and much of the story was off camera so you had to piece together the facts.Overall it was very memorable despite the narrowness of the canvas.

26,frankde-jong,Don't be fooled by the outward simplicity of this great Nordic Western,8,19 June 2021,"""First cow"" is a remarkable WesternIn the first place it is the location. Not the desserts of Southwest USA (think of the Monument valley location and the Westerns of John Ford) but the mud of Northwest USA (in this case Oregon).In the second place the identity of the settlers. In most Westerns the settlers come from Europe and cross the USA from East to West. ""First cow"" is set in 1820, a period before ""the West was won"". The Oregon trail would only be used intensively some 30-40 years later. In ""First cow"" there are not only European settlers but also people from the East (China, Russia) and native people, who originally came from the North. ""First cow"" is a welcome addition with respect to the history of the nation builidng in the USA.In the third place the action, or maybe more properly said, the lack of action. In ""First cow"" there is no sharp distiction between good- and bad guys and there are no gun slingers. Everybody is busy to just survive and doing daily things as preparing a meal and sweeping the floor. When something is robbed, it is not the bank but the cow of the most wealthy businessman in town that is milked illegaly.The film has a surprising narrative structure. Beginning in the present with somebody walking with her dog, the story jumps back to 1820 after a couple of minutes. The few minutes in the present in the first place make the open ending somewhat less open but in the second place gives us an impression of the changes in the landscape in the last 200 years. Most prominent in these changes is that the river, which meanders in 1820, has been straightened out to facilitate the big cargo ships.""First cow"" is remarkable but not unique. In the beginning of the '70s Robert Altman pioneered with ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" (1971) in what I would call the ""Nordic Western"". ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" has undeniable similarities with ""First cow"", especially with respect to place (situated in the even more Nordic Washington state) and action. ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" plays in the beginnening of the 20th century (80 years after ""First cow"") and the settlers are therefore predominantly Europeans.For director Kelly Reichardt the landscape is an important element of her films. The (muddy) landscapes of ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" and ""First Cow"" have much in common, but in ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" brown is the domineering color whereas in ""First cow"" it is green. In terms of color palette ""First cow"" reminded me of ""Leave no trace"" (2018, Debra Granik), with respect to storyline a completely different movie but also situated in Oregon.",First Cow

He later hooks up with King-Lu (Orion Lee), a Chinese immigrant who is also a fugitive. The two succeed in selling biscuits whose ingredients include milk stolen from a cow that is owned by a neighbouring rich English settler, Chief Factor (Toby Jones).Director Kelly Reichardt (the film's co-writer along with Raymond) successfully uses her usual form of subtle story-telling with prolonged, extended scenes. While it can take a while to get used to this style, it pays off greatly in the film's last two-thirds as it did with another of Reichardt's gems, ""Meek's Cutoff"" (2010).Much of ""First Cow"" is simply the day-to-day events of people struggling to get by in difficult circumstances but once conflict and danger set in, the film turns into a great thriller. And Reichardt is greatly aided by beautiful cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt.As with ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008), Reichardt shows concern for the under-class in a scene that greatly contrasts the classes. When Cookie and King-Lu are in the residence of Chief Factor, they hear a conversation between Factor and a local captain discussing the varying successes in disciplining (aka torturing) insubordinate workers in the presence of their peers. The privilege of even being able to have such a discussion is light-years from the life circumstances of the film's heroes and most of the film's other characters. The same can be said of further discussion between Factor and the captain regarding current fashions in Paris and London.""First Cow"" is an outstanding film in a year with few films released in theatres.

30,kjproulx,A Great Film that Won't be for Everyone,8,13 July 2020,"Half of the audience that watches this film will likely hate it. I'm starting with that because this film is incredibly slow in terms of pacing, which will easily turn off the impatient viewers. Personally, if a film like that has an interesting story, a slow pace actually helps to suck me into a story. First Cow, which is one of A24's most recent releases, has just become available on-demand. While I wouldn't rank it among their best when looking at their stellar catalog of films in recent years, it's still a great movie all around.First Cow follows a highly skilled survivalist/cook in Cookie Figowitz (John Magaro), as he stumbles upon a group of traders. Becoming close friends with King-Lu (Orion Lee), they illegally take an opportunity to earn themselves a profit. Once a cow arrives on one of the farms, they steal milk in order to cook biscuits for the townspeople. All seems well and good, but they can only keep it a secret for so long. This premise held my attention so well because the film continuously gave you reasons to care about the two main characters. It was that, on top of the slow pace that really kept me invested.Films like Meek's Cutoff and Night Moves are what had me keeping an eye on director Kelly Reichardt because I found those films showed her true potential as a filmmaker. She's wonderful at bringing out the best in all of her performers. What kept me from loving those two films overall though, was the fact that I found them to be a little too drab in terms of sound design and music. That's clearly her signature because First Cow once again feels a little too much like that. I loved watching this film and everything that happens felt earned and satisfying, but the overall movie can feel a little lifeless at times. That's really my only issue with most of her film that I've seen. She's otherwise an award-worthy filmmaker in my eyes.Yes, John Magaro and Orion Lee are both terrific and hold this film together from start to finish, but the real star of the show here is cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt. Having worked on her two aforementioned films as well as a few others, his work on Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot and Mid90s is when his name truly jumped out at me. Blauvelt is someone that I will begin researching and anxiously awaiting his next project, simply due to the fact that his work on First Cow was his best yet. The camerawork felt like a character in its own right. From certain ways, characters are framed to extreme wide shots that clearly have deeper meanings, the way this film looks pulled me in more than anything else.In the end, there are things about the tone that bothered me throughout the entire movie, but the story, characters, and especially the way the film is shot held my attention throughout. It's hard to recommend this movie to those who are casual viewers and were looking to be entertained because I can almost guarantee that you won't be unless you're a film buff and know what to expect. If it wasn't for the dour feel of the whole thing just not clicking with me, I might be saying that I loved this movie. Overall, it's a very, very well-made film that deserves attention, but from the proper audience.",First Cow
31,msbreviews,First Cow employs A24's trademark unconventional storytelling to tell a sweet story.,7,8 September 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you should know by now, I love watching films as blind as possible: no trailers and a minimum amount of information about the plot (or none at all). A24 became such a popular studio that I don't even need to know anything else about the movie, I'm always in. Universal, Paramount, Warner Bros., Disney, and Columbia might be the Big Five of film studios, but gradually people are starting to shift their attention to smaller, independent ones who deliver fewer movies per year, but a higher ratio of great films. This is also the very first movie I watch from Kelly Reichardt. The simplest of research will show everyone that her films are meant to heavily divide critics and audiences, so which side do I fall on this time?I'm not trying to patronize anyone, but First Cow belongs to that category of movies that audiences hate and critics love simply due to the slow pacing and minimalist story. Audiences will look at this flick as a dull, long, uneventful story, while critics will not only appreciate its remarkable technical attributes, but also the sweet, simple narrative that delivers quite a nice message about friendship, loyalty, but also greed and power. I'm not on either extreme, but I did enjoy this flick. Overall, I actually agree with each group's praises and criticisms.On one hand, this small story feels refreshing and pretty relaxing, having in mind Hollywood is packed with visually overwhelming blockbusters. It's a weird yet therapeutic couple of hours where the viewer follows two friends trying to get by. Cookie has the cooking abilities and smart ideas, while King-Lu uses his sense of opportunity to bring his friends' ideas to life. The chemistry between John Magaro and Orion Lee is phenomenal, making their characters' friendship feel incredibly authentic. The dialogues seem spontaneous and realistic. The editing (also performed by Reichardt) contains few cuts, letting the conversations flow naturally and the action to unravel at a slow, calm pace (in life, things don't arrive fast one after the other).On the other hand, the simplistic narrative is also rather predictable, and it loses the viewer's attention occasionally due to the constant dragging out of several sequences where nothing truly happens, story and/or character-wise. It's undoubtedly a slow-burn, nothing wrong with that, but it just isn't able to be effective throughout the entire runtime. Christopher Blauvelt's cinematography looks gorgeous, and William Tyler's subtle score is particularly pleasant, but visuals and atmosphere can't carry a screenplay for more than two hours. When the story gets going, it's definitely captivating, but it gets itself stuck during short periods spread throughout the whole film.In the end, Reichardt and Jon Raymond's well-written screenplay transmits a pretty kind message developed through two characters who need to find a way to make a living, to improve their lives. Their personalities are distinct, balancing their friendship with both their personal qualities and flaws. Reichardt picks up the co-written narrative and gives it an excellent direction, which apparently has given this duo great success. Hopefully, they'll keep making movies for everyone to enjoy, some more than others.All in all, First Cow possesses one of A24's trademarks: unconventional storytelling. Kelly Reichardt and Jon Raymond deliver a well-written screenplay, telling a minimalist story that will probably divide critics and audiences due to its purposefully slow pace and uneventful narrative. Reichardt, who also edited the film, takes a simple premise and gives it a realistic, grounded, layered direction characterized by genuine conversations and a true friendship. John Magaro and Orion Lee offer flawless performances, elevating their characters with emotionally palpable chemistry. Beautiful cinematography and a subtle score help the movie create a relaxing atmosphere different from the usual Hollywood flicks. Nevertheless, its runtime features dragged out moments, a predictable development story-wise, and while the film's message is quite sweet, it can become a bit of a tedious journey to experience. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who just wants to peacefully watch a simple movie with a great message without caring about how long it takes to reach the end.Rating: B",First Cow
32,0w0,"Cool story, but very stupid characters...",6,11 July 2020,"In one scene, there's just one idiotic choice after another made by the characters... honestly, no normal person would be so idiotic as what was shown in the film, and that makes for a large plot-hole as far as realism goes (this particular scene happens at night, perhaps you'll know which one I mean).There's also several other plot-holes in the film, that once again deals with the characters in the film making extremely illogical choices, but since I have not read the book that this film is based on, I can't say if that is indeed the way that the story unfolds in the book, or if the director of the film simply took some very idiotic creative-license when they directed the film.Either way, the film is OK.

33,Alexander_Blanchett,Kelly Reichardt's best film to date,8,22 February 2020,"A positive surprise. At first the film feels that it doesnt know where it goes and shows a VERY detailed introduction of its two protagonists. But detail is the key word for this newest feature by Kelly Reichardt. The visuals are extremely detailed and so are the characters in general. We get a lot of information just by watching them in their daily lives and slowly the plot thickens and has some unexpected turns. Kelly Reichardt really did a fantastic job telling that story. She proves a fantastic eye for visuality, showing off some fantastic nature shots that really add a lot to the atmosphere of the film. She did everything right with this film, although she might once in a while loses herself a little bit too much in her details. The actors were wisely chosen and the leading roles filled with rather unknown actors who are usually in secondary roles. First of all there is John Magaro who is very subtle and effective. The better performance came from Orion Lee who is extremely charismatic and does a lot with the role given to him. I think he might have a very interesting future. I loved how he handled that role and gave it many different facettes. There is a good supporting performance by Toby Jones who does wonders with his rather one dimensional character. Ewen Bremner is a bit wasted, but not as much as Lily Gladstone which was insulting. Gladstone was brilliant in Reichardt's previous film, and ended up in my Top 5 Supporting Actresses so I was shocked how misused she was in this film. But thats just one of the very few flaws the film that. Another very positive note goes to the score, which is fantastic and as mentioned before the cinematography.

35,garethcrook,More than just another cow movie.,7,11 August 2021,"I know nothing about this going in, but have vague recollections of seeing it advertised and for some reason it stuck. The poster is quite nice, but maybe it's the title, First Cow, what could it be about. Well it's about a cow, or at least a cow is part of the story. Shot in 4:3 it feels oddly intimate. I say oddly as the location here is wide open and nearly entirely outdoors or influenced by it. Cookie (John Magaro) is in the Oregon wilderness. Foraging. Surviving. He's a trapper. More accurately he's the cook for a gang of trapper's. He doesn't seem all that well suited to his rough and tough group. He's sensitive. Enter King-Lu (Orion Lee), right away despite the cultural differences it's clear these two are going to get along. Cookie maybe timid, but he's resourceful, smart. Qualities he also finds in King-Lu, along with a philosophical positivity. They are the light in what's a generally dark, dirty, damp and sodden world, but it's not a bleak film, it's really quite hopeful. The pace is slow and thoughtful, just like Cookie. It gives it a real sincerity, finding beauty in the sometimes mundane. Cookie and King-lu together find peace. Time to dream... and so to the cow. It's not their's this rare creature, the only one in the territory, but with a stealthfull milking regime and Cookie's baking skills, they find themselves a business selling their ""Oily Cakes"" with its 'secret ingredient' milk. Everything seems to be going well, but... and there's always a but. Things are about to get complicated as Toby Jones steps onto screen as Chief Factor, the boss of the local fort where business is done... and owner of the cow. Jones is brilliant, nearly stealing the show, but all the characters are rich, with an impressive diversity that all coexist rather happily. Including Ewen Bremner going full Scottish complete with traditional bonnet. The Cow is Chief Factors pride and joy. For Cookie and King-Lu their meal ticket to a better life, but getting there won't be easy. Of course, First Cow isn't really about a cow. The same way Jaws isn't about a shark. Bathed in melancholia, it's a real slow burn treat of a film, that will leave you feeling calm, rested and with a renewed faith that good people have always existed and will always exist.",First Cow

This is a slow-moving portrait of two men happening across an opportunity in 18th century Oregon. To be perfectly honest, early in the movie I was not especially interested and concerned it would just meander along, focused on establishing the setting. Thankfully, it develops into an elegant story of risk and capitalistic exploitation. Everyone in 18th century Oregon is there for some sort of venture, and it is just starting to boom with people moving in. Cookie and King Lu seem like unlikely friends, a soft-spoken cook and an opportunistic Chinese immigrant. Both characters are very well acted, drawing out subtleties in how they view the cake making opportunity and how they deal with their guilt. The class divide is clear as they know the Commander is so arrogant as to assume nobody would dare steal from him, as he is so high and mighty. It's quite a simple story, but it's a compelling metaphorical tale, with the cow representing the beginnings of the modern economic era. I'm not sure if Reichardt's style is quite my bread and butter, but I like the ideas and the third act was quite well realized. I'm happy to see this quiet, contemplative movie get such critical acclaim; while I certainly don't like it as much, it reminds me somewhat of 2018's fantastic Leave No Trace.",First Cow

In addition, for me, actor John Robert Magaro here was very unlikable to watch. It might be that Jonathan Raymond novel 'The Half Life' - on which ""First cow"" is based - is more interesting, but now I even do not want to read it because of this quirky movie endeavor.

41,fciocca,A little fairy tale.,7,19 August 2021,"""First Cow"" reminded me of one of those fairy tales that my parents used to read me when I was a child. The scenery is mystical, the movie brings you into another world. I liked the slow pace, the photography, the steady camera movements. I am not a huge fan of the 4:3 aspect ratio, and I think that really few directors understood when and how to use it. In this case it just works and helped me to immerse even more in the story.The plot itself is not particularly original, there are no twists, and yet I appreciated watching such a simple and well conceived narration. The aesthetic is wonderful and I liked the colors and the grainy filter used. Classic instruments such as the acoustic guitar or the violin are used to compose a basic and yet efficient soundtrack, that took me to another time. The director also managed to exploit the environmental sound, such as the noise of a colonial settlement or the acoustics of nature. Everything is backed up by good acting. I am always happy when big names such as Toby Jones take part in small projects like this one, it really helps this kind of cinema to enlarge its audience.""First Cow"" tells a story through small visive and acoustic details. In its simplicity, it is very entertaining and definitely not for all. This is a really slow paced movie and I would have cut some scenes that were maybe too long, but in general I did not feel bored. On the contrary, two hours flew away like nothing. It is truly a hidden gem that I personally recommend.",First Cow

I'm for the second btw.It's not perfect, it's not made of a set of layers that throughout the narrative expose complex motifs that shake the story, but it's more than capable to transmite tranquility, emotion and above all a sense of resilience and unity.First Cow's best moment is the last arc, no doubt for me. The final scenes hits us well, really really well.I'm a sucker for this aspect ratio (1.66:1), with great compositions and color scheme, like a painting in motion.",First Cow
44,sirwillisiv,A compelling and well-crafted slice of life...,9,29 March 2021,"First Cow tells the story of a lowly cook and Chinese immigrant who seek their fortune together in the gritty American frontier of the 1820s. With bountiful production design and durable performances from a cast of fresh faces, First Cow is an authentic slice of life about friendship, capitalism and American dream during the country's more tender and primitive state.It's a slow burner and mostly devoid of a soundtrack, but I think this is one of the few instances where this method works to the film's advantage. This raw and slow-paced approach helps immerse the audience within the era, absorb its risks, understand the character's plight and feel the passage time more effectively. It manages to be sweet and harsh with its artful simplicity, though I understand why this meandering style can be a huge turn-off to select audiences.I do think some shots and sequences go on for a tad too long, but the rich production values and delicate acting manage to keep me involved in a unique, realistic sense. It's unfortunate First Cow flew under the radar because it's solid proof that you don't need to overstylize your craft and rely on melodrama to push a narrative. Realism can be oftentimes more compelling.",First Cow

Cookie Figowitz and King Lee form an odd couple of dreamers who get by on clever schemes and the milk of the lone piece of livestock in the area. Their struggles present the already existent class struggles that an early Capitalist system festers, and though politically intriguing, the core of the film is the buddy buddy relationship born out of necessity, and nurtured by an unspoken craving for companionship.The pair realize that to make money, they need money, and their cash cow could be a launching pad to a grand and profitable future. Along the way they discover a common bond of humanity, which they don't learn to cherish properly until the final, fitting frame.Eschewing grandiose adventure in favour of minute details, Reichardt's pace is deliberate and sure. The result is a gritty western without horses, saloon brawls or gunfights. One that feels pretty damn true to the time. Turns out the early settlers were dealing with a pretty mild mild west, which was pretty sweet and awfully harsh in alternating doses.""First Cow"" is perfectly bovine.hipCRANK",First Cow

As unpredictable as it is gorgeous, Reichardt balances various genres as the film eventually spins itself into a heist-film with high tension and stakes.

47,MovieBuff11732,A Movie Everyone Should See,9,27 October 2020,"Another movie that is glanced over by many people. This movie defiantly deserves a watch if you are a movie fan.The First Cow is about a skilled cook named Cookie (John Magaro) who travels with a group of fur trappers. He comes across a Chineses immigrant named King-Lu (Orion Lee) who has nothing so Cookie helps him get to a good place. Many months later they both meet at a bar and decide to start selling baked goods in town with a cow that has just came to the land but the cow is owned by Chief Factor (Toby Jones) and doesn't know about this yet.The First Cow was a movie that surprised me. I thought it was going to be your typical run of the mill indy movie that wasn't all that impressive. After I pressed the off button on the remote I was quite surprised with what the movie offered. There are many great things in this film. The story was really engaging. It was different than a typical story you find in movies now. The only problem I had with the story is the start to the film. It starts off in present day and then transitions into the time period that the movie is set in. The transition is really good but that scene didn't really need to be there. That was the only problem I had with the movie. The story was really well done. The characters were marvelously written and you felt for all of them. The structor of the story was also different. It did many things you just don't see anymore.The acting was also fantastic. John Magaro had the best performance in the film. His character was written really well, but without him I bet I wouldn't feel the way I did about the character. Orion Lee's character was more of a comedic guy but it didn't take away from the story. Sometimes in films now, the comedy feels like a kid who makes a joke at a funeral. This movie placed all of the jokes in the right place and none of them felt out of place. Toby Jones was also in this film. He does a lot of main stream movies like Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom and Captain America The First Avenger but he still makes time for smaller movies like The Snowman and this. He didn't have a whole lot to do in this film but when he was in the film he ate it up. Overall the acting in this film was just magnificent.The cinematography was enticing to watch. They did a lot of lingering shots in this film. I know it sounds like it might be boring but it never was. Many films do lingering shots like 2001 A Space Odyssey, Unbreakable, and The Visit. Two of those movies were directed by M. Night Shyamalan which with his film, they make the movie even scarier. There were a few suspenseful scenes in the film but nothing on the level of those movies. They used the lingering shot so you could soak up the background. I love when movies do that. It shows how lived in the environment around the characters is. They also added a grainy texture to the picture. At the start they had normal picture but about five minutes in it changed to a more grainy picture. Sort of like what the First Man did. Thats what indicated at the start that this film took place in a different time period.The First Cow was a film I would recommend to anyone because of the great cinematography and the magnificent acting. The story is also something to take notes on.",First Cow

49,theredsky,First cow Review,7,6 September 2020,"The film's visual style is impressive but it's story and pacing is what really drags this film down for me. The cinematography is the one aspect I found to be excellent. The framing is on point and impressive and it adds a lot to the film's style. The production design and costumes are also really good here too. These characters look and feel as if they in the 1820s. The performances are also great too. Each character feels believable and works to help tell the story of the film. Although I like all that, the pacing is not very good. It feels incredibly long and tedious without any real majorly satisfying payoff. It's a 2 hour movie that feels like it goes on for 2 and a half hours. If they had cut down some of the scenes, this issue wouldn't be as major as it is. There were some elements of the story I enjoyed and some I found to be pointless. If you like A24 then check it out but don't have your hopes incredibly high for it.",First Cow

52,movieswithgreg,Good luck trying to milk enjoyment from this udderly glacial marxist Western.,5,31 December 2020,"The other reviews are right -- this is painfully, sometimes excruciatingly slow.
When slow is done right, it glues your attention to the screen. When it's not done so well, it makes you question your self-respect in watching this to the end.It's painfully realistic, like 1820s poor people in the new West would be. It's quiet, like it would be. It's low on words, like it would be. It's a socio-economic moral play, done so gently that no yolks could possibly be broken. It's unusually claustrophobic for a Western, with scarce wide shots we like to see in Westerns. It is, after all, apparently shot entirely in a regional park on the outskirts of Portland, Oregon.The acting and actors are top notch. So there is that. And that sound you begin to hear will be your heart thumping inside your chest. Not because you'll be excited, but because everything else will be so crypt-quiet that it will make a normal heart beat sound like bongo night at Brando's crib circa 1954..",First Cow
53,cappiethadog,The udder Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid,9,8 March 2021,"The first cow on North American soil was spotted at the Plymouth settlement. Europeans brought them over from the old country in the 15th century. A second cattle colony, resided in Mexico; Texas, too, even after the Lone Star state announced its independence. Texan ranchers enjoyed the spoils of a considerable bovine inheritance and became wealthy men. ""The first cow in the territory,"" the Pacific Northwest, either came from San Francisco or San Luis Obispo. Cookie Figowitz(John Magaro), in Kelly Reichardt's ""First Cow"", learns as much from a group of poker players talk about the dairy cow that Chief Factor(Toby Jones) bought, while the pastry chef downs a shot of whiskey at the saloon bar. A Virginia native, the trained cook(specializing in comestibles) was hired by prospectors to feed them on their westward journey. Before the gold rush, men made their fortunes on the beaver, slaughtered for their pelts and oils. Set in the 1820s, ""First Cow"" depicts the real wild west; ""wild"" as in wilderness, not gunfights at the O.K. Corral. The filmmaker's vision of an Oregon untamed is devoid of cowboys in ten gallon hats, guns a blazing, in a war over land with shirtless Indians outfitted with bows and arrows. This is not your father's John Ford western. The iconography associated with the genre is nowhere to be seen in the filmmaker's mis-en-scene. There is nary a horse to be glimpsed in Reichardt's western. There is nary an Indian in ""Meek's Cutoff"", the Portland-based auteur's last experiment in reconstructing the western.Reichardt doesn't need a whole tribe. One Indian is enough. That's the Bertolt Brecht in her speaking. Stephen Meek(Bruce Greenwood), the frontier guide, dressed like he stepped out of a Wild West show with one of those bigger-than-life personalities to match, may or may not be leading a group of fellow travelers to the Oregon Trail in good faith. ""Meek's Cutoff"", with its wagons and horses, inching their way across the expanse of an unvarnished prairie, looks more like your standard western sans an action set-piece. The filmmaker likes her action implied. Out gathering firewood, Emily Tetherow(Michelle Williams) comes face-to-face with a Native American, a Paiute, causing both parties to scurry in opposite directions. Solomon(Will Patton), Emily's husband, joins Stephen in pursuit of the nameless enemy(Rod Rondeaux), leaving the ad hoc camp on horseback. Reichardt subverts genre filmmaking with a feminine lens, choosing to shoot the people behind. Action is presumed, a heated chase, lots of galloping hooves implied, when the two men return with the horseless Indian, made to walk, flanked by both Stephen and Solomon, holding each side of a rope. The filmmaker rewrites the myth of John Wayne and his ilk; men like Ethan Edwards, and in ""Meek's Cutoff"", Stephen Meek, who helped tame the frontier to make it safe for children and womenfolk alike. Ethan Edwards, in John Ford's ""The Searchers"", riding graveside, a hole, shoots repeatedly at the Najavo tribesman in permanent repose, blinding him, the heroic figure explains, forevermore in the afterlife. Cut in the same mode, Stephen, a propagandist, alleges that the Paiutes make eyelid cuts on their prisoners, then made to face the sun while lying down prostrate, blinding them in the process. Emily, the Debbie(Natalie Wood) stand-in, sides with the Indian, saving him from Stephen Meek's gun or slip knot. Claims of being their protector falls on Emily's deaf ears; she diagnoses the hero figure as such: ""All I see is vanity,"" which succinctly demythologizes the cowboy.""I'm Chinese,"" King Lu(Orion Lee), in ""First Cow"", corrects the pastry chef when he mistakes the stranger for an Indian, hiding in the foliage well-past dusk. The two mortal enemies become fast friends, a sort of ""Dances with Kings"", a filmic anecdote. Set twenty years before ""Meek's Cutoff"", Kelly Reichardt reinvents the Western again, this time, employing a man of Asian descent as a Native American surrogate. A bonafide auteur, Reichardt, once again, relegates the action offscreen, using hearsay, encapsulated in King Lu's monologue about watching his partner die at the hands of renegade beaver trappers, and the retaliation, a gunshot to the hunter's face, and escape. Unlike the classic Hollywood western, ""First Cow"" is set on the Oregon Trail, where violence between natives and settlers were rare. This shanty town, by default, is the closest approximation to a sanctuary that the Native Americans could have hoped for after foreigners displaced them from their homes. As aforementioned by the encroaching pilgrims in ""Meek's Cutoff"", at that time, the Oregon territory was independent of the United States; a sovereign nation. Stephen Meek, the Virginians suspect, collaborates with England, and took an unscheduled detour from the main pathway to avert them from their settlement, just like the one in ""First Cow"", probably Willamette. The chief factor, an Englishman, created a small empire of his own by exploiting the native population. The chief factor's wife(Lily Gladstone), a half-breed, and her relatives, had no choice but to persevere the humiliation of their tribe's degraded state through assimilation and social climbing. Against this backdrop of an unhappy, but integrated population, Cookie and King Lu become business partners, selling pastries at the open market.""Doesn't seem new to me,"" Cookie answers, failing to concur with King Lu's assessment, the potentiality of an ordinary, but enterprising man's ability to procure a fortune. The well-travelled man recognizes, accurately, the west as being untouched. ""Seems old,"" the pastry chef adds. In passing, back at King Lu's shack of a home, Cookie tells his cosmopolitan friend about the dairy cow's arrival by barge earlier that day. King Lu, ironically, isn't excited. Milk doesn't agree with him. Cookie sees the bigger picture; he can use the milk for baked goods. Reichardt foreshadows her dazzling use of post-modernist filmmaking. Both men, in a sense, break the fourth wall, from here on, once King Lu realizes the opportunity to make money. The cow is private property. They'll have to acquire the key ingredient for their signature hot oily cakes through illegal means, a crime. Dressed in all-black, King Lu resembles Jack Palance, the gunslinger, in George Stevens' ""Shane"", but the filmmaker, a semiologist, understands that black signifies nothing, since ""First Cow"" posits itself outside the genre, and its conventions. But everything old is new again, stipulated earlier by the Socratic dialogue, steeped in filmic self-awareness between both men, representative of the modernism/post-modernism binary that drives the narrative, a feminist reworking of George Roy Hill's ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".The last horse, that's what the bicycle salesman pitches when he interrupts the sheriff's attempt to deputize some volunteers from the townsfolk, in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". Conversely, the first horse is what the Indians in this Oregon settlement fear; it's easier to get them by four hooves than two feet. They could be potential bank robbers, Cookie and King Lu, but the lack of guns and horses limit the options for these budding criminals. Such are the circumstances, the lack of technology, which finds Cookie milking another man's cow while King Lu stands watch on a tree branch. Whereas Etta(Katherine Ross), a schoolteacher, kept The Sundance Kid romantically occupied, the dairy cow acts as a stand-in for the love interest, in which Cookie sweet talks the bovine as he squeezes her udders. Since there is no woman, the dairy cow completes the love triangle. King Lu, however, loves the bovine, solely for her milk. The lack of a woman vying for the two men's attention dislocates the masculine/feminine binary, then reassembles itself within this platonic same-sex relationship. While King Lu, shirtless and sweaty, chops wood under the hot sun, Cookie remains indoors, sweeping floors and straightening out his friend's belongings, going outside only to collect wildflowers for the vase. Like the desperados in the George Roy Hill classic, both Cookie and King Lu have nothing but disdain for the rich, and that their time is fleeting. They're unofficially the Hole-in-the-Tree gang, named after the cottonwood they hide their money in. Eventually, the chief factor discovers the theft of his milk. The pursuit of these thieves recalls ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". ""I can't swim,"" The Sundance Kid(Robert Redford) alerts Butch(Paul Newman) in the famous canyon scene. Cookie can't swim either, apparently. He stops to look at the river and decides against jumping off the cliff.""First Cow"" is a story about the real west. Not the Hollywood version; the filmic west of train robberies and showdowns at high noon to see who's the quicker draw. Kelly Reichardt is telling the story of legal stealing; the birth of capitalism. The chief factor builds a fence around his dairy cow, a metaphor, perhaps, for regulation.",First Cow

We know the Californian gold rush dragged countless souls to NW ""ex""-Mexico, but before that was the rush for Fur. This film captures that ""Silas Marner"" moment, where beaver-felt in Europe was on the wane, in favor of Silk. You really need some of the frontier on the inside to appreciate how well done & intricate are the details here. A man on foot is far less effective than one on horseback, making our two fellow-pioneers poor; though you'd expect the Squire, at least to own a horse? And I've never met an oriental man who can't cook better than ANY Westerner - a fact of life that's hard to ignore. As for the pace of this artistic film, if you complain about that it's slightly missing the point. You see a lot of this in the work of the French cinematic school, mid 20th Century, long scenes with minimalist dialogue (perfectly spoken) & punctilious for the tiniest of details - something Hollywood ought to consider as an alternative to ""effects for FXs-sake"", big-star Egos, oppressive self-censorship and disarmingly gratuitous violence. I liked First Cow, not only for its cinematic endeavor, but also for its a-u-d-a-c-i-t-y to be different in an age of in-your-face predictable-ness.

It is a bromance for the ages.Pacing is slower than necessary, but no more than one would expect from a Studio A24 production.

Those expecting modern pacing, shootouts, and explosions will be sorely disappointed.I am glad there wasn't much swearing or overt racism except for the scene where everyone stared in disbelief that King dared to talk to the Factor. Every character is a lovely shade of gray. I wanted everyone to wash their dirty hands while eating, but germ theory was still 50 years out.A few caveats- this is shot in letterbox and is nowhere near 4K resolution.

62,steven-leibson,A small film worthy of watching on Amazon Prime,8,21 February 2021,"""First Cow"" is a small film in scope, in format (4:3), and in release - its really only available as video on demand. It's a relatively expensive film to watch on Amazon Prime, but still less expensive than buying two movie tickets to a theater, which is hard in the time of COVID. This is a buddy film set in the pre-territory Oregon wilderness of 1820, when the fur-trading Hudson's Bay Company was the government. The buddies are an itinerant cook named ""Cookie"" and a well-traveled Chinese man named ""King-Lu."" The two accidentally find each other during a trapping expedition. They part quickly and then rejoin shortly after that. King-Lu has a spectrum of entrepreneurial aspirations and Cookie dreams of opening a hotel or bakery. He's a trained baker's apprentice from Maryland. The two hatch a scheme to make money in the wilderness. The scheme involves making pastries using stolen milk from the only cow in the territory, the ""first cow"" of the film's title. As the only tasty fast food available in 1820 Oregon, the donuts sell like hotcakes. However, this movie's not really about the cow nor the resulting donuts. It's about two wanderers finding each other at the end of the world and become fast friends. No explosions. No superheroes. No gunfights. No muddled morality. Just a small, tight buddy film set in unfamiliar and interesting terrain with a fascinating and subtle look at the Northwest Native Americans as backdrop.

That isn't surprising because it was made by my favorite film company, A24, which specializes in strange, unconventional movies (Midsommar; The Lighthouse; Hereditary; The VVitch; Moonlight; The Killing of a Sacred Deer...). It is set in 1820 in the early days of America, and follows the story of two society's outcasts: a skilled cook and a Chinese immigrant, who are both lost in life and looking for a shelter and a purpose. Through small acts of kindness they find true connection to each other, becoming not just friends and each other's ""business"" partners, but reciprocal ""beacons of light"", which brought them both hope for a brighter future. Two people connected not by mutual interests, or race, or any kind of group identity; but by their misfortunes and the way they view life.
I personally thought that their friendship, considering it is the films essence, wasn't accentuated well enough. It all seemed very vague and obscure; and there could have been a lot more subtle, short scenes which would have further explored their relationship with each other. Apart from that, this film is reaaally slow, but it was conceived that way, and many people found it ""unhurried"", ""peaceful"" and ""meditative""; which is really the same thing, it's just a question of subjective perception. To fully appreciate a film like this you have to get yourself in a proper mood, and set your expectations accordingly. I went into this films (just like any other film) knowing absolutely nothing: I don't watch trailers and I don't read descriptions; so naturally I had no expectations in any direction apart from that the film should be good. Looking back on it, if I knew how consistently slow it would be, I probably would have enjoyed it a bit more.

Enjoyable cameo from Toby Young adds to the enjoyment. A couple of wildly OOT plot devices on coincidence or timings are forgiven.

72,organicsocial,Perils of Enterprise in the New World... and yeah there is a Cow!,10,13 July 2020,"Americans have always been enterprising. Sometimes to their own detriment. If anyone ever made a movie about the origin story of the ""American Dream"" then this is it. Its about the hustle in the new world for creating something truly original. Yes there is a bit of a scheme involved. The ""First Cow"" in its whole serene presence and bovine grace represents the vastness of opportunities and the inherent urge of those in power to limit its access to those who may be more skilled, more persevering, more aspiring and perhaps more deserving.The First Cow is a movie set in a time which is often depicted in the confined cinematic universe of gun toting cowboys and the audience is usually never exposed to this side of the wild west which tends to focus on the people who really survived the time preserving their sanity. I think people like Cookie and King were the kind of people who truly built America. Btw, there's a nice ring to the name ""Cookie King""! A restaurant and a bakery by that name may actually work.On a different note, being a Hindu born in India, I'm naturally inclined to call this movie an evidence on how important a single ""Cow"" could be for the community. Divine maternal nature of the Cow which the Hindus have come to worship over thousands of years isn't the least bit irrational.Well, in terms of the acting, the two lead men have done a splendid job. This is the first time I watched a Kelly Reichardt movie and I find it astonishingly rich and character driven despite its slow pace and sparse dialogue. It reminded me of Satyajit Ray movies such as Pather Panchali. It is that visual storytelling and stillness which just pulls you into the story.

I understand from an interview with her, that Ms. Reichardt thought the format would help capture the characters' faces. As someone accustomed to the conventionally wider screen, the narrow frame was only a distraction. I also didn't like the cinematography, which seemed unnecessarily dark and dreary. It went beyond trying to create an atmosphere and ended up looking like the DP had made a mistake in his camera settings. The story itself was very slow in developing. Ms. Reichardt's earlier films also were slow paced, but the pacing fit them so well that it aided their stories. This time it just interfered.

In the screen adaptation one of the character is turned into a chinese emigrant. This works fine for me and doesnt seem to take away from the story in any way.While a lot of people are complaining about the slow tempo of the film i think thats exactly what Kelly Reichardt is going for. If anything, the story actually could be prolonged even more allowing us to see more of the lives and personal philosophies of Cookie and King. The plot is minimalist, but it suits the message.To me Fist Cow seems like a critique of capitalism and a moral story about how we shouldnt take too many chances. You get lucky ones or twise, but you wont be lucky forever so dont push your luck too much. In that sense it is a fatalist story, because were aware that things will probably turn bad eventually. And when they inevitably do it seems like justice is served. Despite that we still sympathize with the main characters because their struggle is not to take advantage of others, but to make their dreams come true and finally get out of the misery they exist in.The movie does a great job of not being black and white with its ethics. A great deed is followed by an act of stealing. People are complex and the choices they make are often the result of their environment and the circumstances they live in.Many people will milk your cow in a lifetime and this story goes to show how you cant really hate anyone that you understand.

She returns to the meditative style of her earlier works which has been absent in the last two movies and the result is astonishing, on up there with some of her finest works.Setting in 19th Century Oregon Territory the story follows two men: a skilled cook and Chinese immigrant businessman who formed unlikely friendship and decided to start a pastry business by stealing milk from the cow of the powerful landowner.While it is the longest film set to date for Reichardt, this might be the easiest film to digest. Reichardt movies are always about time & place/ nature and it's habitats, and here she reconstructs ancient Oregon Territory with meticulous care and vividly portrayed the lives of Oregon's First People and gives a glimpse into an earliest form of capitalism taking place in a wild frontier while covering the growing friendship of two men which got interrupted when they saw an opportunity (Cow) and starting to chase the never fulfilling american dream. As always cinematography is mesmerising and peacefully capturing all powerful natural landscapes (forest, riverbank) and most of the moments of the movie without moving an inch. Direction from Reichardt is immersive and quietly unfold the drama, and as much as I saw it coming the ending still hard hitting and connecting to the opening it is contemplative. Two lead performances are terrifc, I especially enjoyed that from John Magaro and Orion Lee is a delight.

Set during the 1820s, Oregon Territory, a crossroads of cultures and personalities, smack dab on that frontier life as the beaver trapping trade was beginning to exhaust, and the northwest was yet to be cracked open with gold fever and big timber dreams. This is just the kind of period piece post-western (yet proto-western) poetry I've grown to deeply enjoy. A sense of time and history and civilization's inevitable yet ever-ephemeral boots are resounding in this picture. A respectful portrayal of a couple of hearty fellows etching out a life on the unfettered frontier of yesterday, which has since transformed into the much fettered parking-lot of today. And even though I'm giving it my stamp of approval, I understand that this film will not be for everyone, it is a meditative, strolling thing, untroubled by romanticized gestures of western drama, but more so inspired by a messy, yet honest, proletarian perspective. Qualities of director Kelly Reichardt at her best. For if you are a fan of her laid-back man vs. self vs. nature narratives this will be your biscuit.

111,ComityZenThrall,Bovine Perspication,10,2 May 2021,"This movie shares a Samuel Beckettian sensibility with the implacable existential Sisters Brothers Western movie, in a much smaller budget than Big Hollywood Sisters Brothers. Two guys waiting for the ineffable, and the mystery unfolds. First Cow conducts American delusion in the same vein as Sisters Brothers and has a more satisfying resolution. Unlike Sisters Bros where the Illusion of the Frontier individual is reinforced, First Cow was marketed as a 'buddy movie' It is far more than just 2 men with rapport. Just like America is more than simple people living simple lives. First Cow depicts the self-delusion of prosperity. From the opening every scene registers tactile impressions that reanimate memories of wood, weeds (the original kind, not the intoxicants, water, sight, especially touch and sound from my childhood spent outdoors in wild places when I pretended to be an explorer, who I was, in retrospect. This the most tactile movie ever. From the taste of wild mushrooms, the original not the intoxicant, to the metallic vibration of the juice harp to the changes in elevation of steep ravines. It beats any French sensuous film with its kinesthetic vicariousness. All depicted with plausible dialogue, in beautifully damp autumnal Oregon. You can see your breath!The role of women on the frontier as an internal colony is alluded to, as well as native people, and the US Army as enforcers of internal colonies. In this sense alone, First Cow should be shown to every American History Class in every High School just to balance out the Manifest Depravity that is still taught as The History of America.Warning: Movie contains unwed cows giving milk. Only pregnant/calving cows give milk. The movie blurs this fact.Warning: A discussion of fashion is contained in the movie. Fashion as a means of social control is inferred.This movie is multi-valent as a story of the Old-Old West, post Lewis and Clark a story of poverty, immigrant, and the legacy of all those facets. First Cow is also a comedy reminding me that the interplay of poverty, Immigrants, manifest destiny and their opposites extravagance, deluded citizens, and ""Ownership"" has never evolved. America is still a ginormous, internecine, filth farm of tenants. The pioneers/explorers envy the Native peoples, who are the haves while the pioneers/explorers are the have nots, not only materially, but also spiritually. The 'quest' of the explorers is not clear to themselves. In addition to the natural world and its privations, the film reveals the need for the evil men do in the service of control thru punishment and environmental degradation. It is also a tragedy.The cast is superb with many stellar actors in small roles, the kind of character written, to show their chops.I recognized many faces from productions larger than this small movie. Toby Jones as ardent burgher masquerading as arrogant patrician is a good bit of typecasting.The script's use of foreshadowing is exquisite like a short story by O. Henry. O as in Ominous.Visually, the cinematography plays with horizontality to reinforce the expanding directionlessness of people's lives and the conquest of the frontier. Also vertically is used to focus our vision, in imaginative ways, on the promise of better things, which never happen.The soundtrack is an Old Crow Medicine Show ditty Ken Burns would salivate over with. Twanging fiddle to punctuate scenes of mud, penury, and ineffectual lives. These tunes show characters try very hard; America is filled with such people. America is also effectuated with Owners who can exploit the deluded.A fantastic exploration of character, history, eminence and impoverishment. Kind of like today?

The first shot of the cargo ship - a symbol of world trade and consumerism - transitioning into the movie's main period may be a sign that this was the director's intention all along.Both the characters of the Cookie and King-Lu are deep, skilled, and sensitive individuals, who are ultimately killed (we know from their bones being dug up in the second scene) by their drive to fit in and succeed in a nascent capitalist world. Cookie, on the one hand, is a highly skilled baker and hedonist who enjoys the good things in life: drink, food, warmth, and friendship. His dream is to open a hotel or bakery. King-lu is a multilingual traveler whose determination, resourcefulness, and will to survive make him a stand out character. Both find friendship and companionship in each other as outcasts in the harsh (yet bountiful) landscape of Oregon.As far as symbols go, I see the relationship between the two main characters as representing human nature, and more specifically that desire among us all to be loved and give love, to care for and be cared for. The cow represents capital, or wealth. It is hoarded by the only rich man in town, and used not for sustenance or selfless purposes, but as a mere delicacy, a superficial pleasure. Whilst most people in town live in the dirt, Chief Factor uses his cow to flavor his tea.The fact that that Cookie and King-lu need to steal his milk to ""get ahead"" (read: survive) is a commentary that the means of production tend to be hoarded and controlled by the few. The two are eventually caught and pay the ultimate price. Was the punishment proportionate to the crime? What was their crime, really?Their crime was being born into a capitalist society, which rather than rewarding their value as humans and productivity as members of society, pushed them to delinquency and eventually got them killed.",First Cow
117,alicankunt,Slice of life from the 1800s.,7,12 October 2020,"I had heard about this movie by the buzz it created when it first came out early this year and decided to give it a go.The film is basically a slice of life period drama. It's realistic, it's slow, at times it's uninteresting, much like everyday life... in the 1800s.
The characters are well established, the plot is well developed, dialogues are realistic.
And much like real life it doesn't have a simple beginning or an ending.
I understand that this was an intentional decision but after watching the film this leaves one with a feeling like having read some chapters from the middle of a book, but not the whole book itself.Even though I do want to pick up the story from where it left off and see where it goes, the movie as it is, is fulfiling nevertheless.Definitely worth watching.",First Cow

The film sequences, editing is excellent. The camera shots are all quality. Directing is very good, and those uncomfortable silences in the film are brilliantly done.

If you look and listen carefully you will understand where we started to lose ourselves in ""modern life"" and there is completely detailed scenes, clothes, foods, dialogues. You can be amaze with atmosphere. But if you looking for an action, or movie timeline like climax or 3-5 structure, i'm sorry and don't waste your time.

125,elliottmedia-net,Why directors should not edit their films,3,11 October 2021,"The many good reviews of this film baffled me - yes, the story is an endearing one, the script well written and acting professional and credible, the bleak and finally unsuccessful struggle against the odds moving and suitably poetic, a savage indictment of capitalism in a 19thC wilderness - all stuff to get the indie crowd salivating who will also forgive the completely gratuitous 4:3 aspect ratio, a pretentious archaism that, along with the muddy lighting all adds up to an indy 'look' of a sort. OK, I can see how and why this film worked the festival circuit, but my oh my it is seriously baaaaad cinema.For some people, it is good enough to write a good novel, adapt it into a good screenplay, make a series of good casting calls and let that do the work. But at that point it is all a literary exercise, it's no different from theatre. To get an audience to love the film, you have to direct. And the directing in First Cow collapses into a muddy soup which mostly spoils a lot of potentially good plot twists, good dialogue, varied pace, structure, narrative verve and sense of time and place. It just does not entertain in any meaningful definition of the word. If you like this film, you probably would have enjoyed the novel more.The biggest problem is that the director also edited the film, so she adapted the screenplay, directed the shoot and edited the film. This should already sound alarm bells. To have such complete creative control is a burden that only sometimes leads to directors making good cinema. The film therefore looks and feels very hand made, but not in a good way. Scenes that should have been axed or cut right down are 'forced' to work in the hands of an artist who will not admit defeat and must render the scene as it was intended to look before the day of the shoot.Specifically the ensemble interior scenes are *almost* saved by the acting of Toby Jones - a generous, forebearing and kindly presence, but there are too many longueurs, painful clunky moments where the actors seem to be saying 'what do I do now?' and a good editor with sharp scissors would have saved us, the ticket buying public from the director's excesses and given us a comfortable watch.The exterior fur trapper's camp scenes do *not* create the gritty, frontier atmosphere you might hope for, instead we're treated to extras doing 'living history' loops of fur scraping and rock banging and whatever else to try and get us into the mood but the effect is a sort of mime workshop in the woods behind a film school. A good editor would have told Kelly it looked painful and didn't work and minimised it, instead its all over the place.The wretched trappers who torment and bully 'Cookie' are left to their own devices as actors and so do a reasonable attempt at stagey rambunctiousness, but it is loose and sloppy and very obviously improvised and undirected. You get the feeling that the director is just trying to get through the semi-thought out storyboard and, with the help of a patient DOP to make sure there are enough shots to make the edit work, is longing for the day the shoot is over and she can get back to a warm edit, a screen and plenty of time to figure it all out.The result is a decent enough tale, plenty of good stuff, the prettiest cow you've ever seen and some clearly nicely made cakes drowning in a rambling, visually muddled slog whose lack of pace and general flabbiness is hidden behind a figleaf of indie chic.Finally, if you took your dog out for a walk and it dug up a human skull, what would you do? I'd run screaming to the police and demand sedative medication, then probably move out of the area. The prologue figure in First Cow sets about excavating with her bare hands and carefully exposes two full human skeletons. Even the dog looks like it thinks she's nuts.",First Cow

Couldn't there have been a better statement for the ending. Not sure what the author or was it the director was trying to say. In addition, streaming this at home was very disappointing due to the low lighting of the film. Apparently, people were fascinated by the great cinematography, whereas I was frustrated by the inability to see anything during all the night shots. Reminded me of going to an outdoor theater where they started the film a half hour before sunset and all you saw was a blank screen. Not to mention the odd aspect ratio. It made me think of a film student effort where the point was to display mastery of as many different skills as possible in one film.

137,scraker61,Aspires to greatness but just misses. But do see it.,8,30 December 2020,"SPOILER ALERT. First the good. It is a story that holds you until the end. It is obvious that the filmmakers were passionate. The atmosphere created by the film set in the 1800's is believable. Attention that is real was taken to try and authenticate the era and what it looked like. As an independent film, with locations in the wild and budgets that are limited, it is difficult to do this. So I salute you for that. The pace, which is slow, works as development of character. I cared about the characters and I wanted to know how it ends. I dismiss films very fast but I did not dismiss this one. I stayed with it to the end and I am not disappointed that I did. Now the frustrating. The thing that jumped out for me immediately was the language of King-Lu. He is from China by birth, but he spoke English like he was a professor of English. No accent at all and without a hint of hesitation in his words. English was not his first language and anyone from China in the 1800's in the Pacific Northwest, with English as a second language, is going to have an accent that is noticeable. And a vocabulary that is limited more than this. No matter of his history before he got there. I found this distracting. Also, neither King-Lu nor Cookie had a gun. That was unlikely highly. It was necessary for survival against predators, and for hunting your next meal. No one lived in the wilderness back then without one or they would not eat. Trapping squirrels is a way to supplement your supply of food, not sustain it. They needed a gun. And speaking of eating, that is exactly what any of the wolves (shown in the film) grizzly bears, mountain lions and other predators would have done to the cow the first night if it was left unguarded and unfenced as it was. Homesteaders had barns and dogs to guard the property for a reason. Leave your stock to roam alone at night and you won't have stock left in the morning. A big old fat cow like that is a target that is ready for Thanksgiving Dinner for the first predator that got to it. And finally I do not like it when movies end and leave it to the viewer to speculate on what happened. You are the filmmaker tell us what happened in more detail than you did. I wanted to know. The mystery was not satisfying. But still all things being said I would recommend people see this film. A lot of very good things and it does hold you until the end",First Cow

140,pesilat64,Don't watch if you are easily bored,9,19 July 2020,"Thanks to constant mental stimulation due to social media, cell phones, and online content always being available, the majority of people now have an extremely short attention span. If that sounds like you, then don't watch this.I personally consider myself to be a very patient person, and if you are willing to just be patient and actively appreciate the film you will find this film to be a rich cinematic treat. The cinematography is exquisite, meticulously framed in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The performances are extremely watchable - these characters could easily have been rather dull or boring but the brilliant actors elevate them to near-mythological status. The plot, while cliched, is supported so well by the aforementioned elements that it feels like a completely new experience to the other films that have similar plots.If you only watch films for a quick dopamine hit, this is not the film for you. In order to get anything out of this film, you must put in some of your own thought. Under the surface, the film is rich with ideas about capitalism, the American Dream, and especially male friendship. It's left up to the viewer to interpret the work for themselves, which is what I appreciate most about Kelly Reichardt - she doesn't try to force a message down your throat, she just lets you interpret her films however you want to. But you need to be patient if you want to get a good experience, which many people, especially on this website, don't quite seem to understand.",First Cow
141,dwarfgalaxy,Cowabunga!,10,3 November 2020,"Finding myself bored of reading the low-scoring reviews of their purported boredom whilst watching this film, I decided to give it a chance and judge for myself. Happily, I can say this is a thoroughly enjoyable representation of the era the filmmakers set out to re-create. Excellent work there! The pace allows one to be mentally immersed, a sense of time-travel to a previous world, a world which was here before you or I existed.Instead of relying on the cliched Wild West rough-and-tough shoot-'em-up manly man, the film focuses on two intellectual, creative entrepreneurs who, from absolutely nothing but their creativity and wit, made something people wanted, then needed, and paid good money for. Both from extremely different backgrounds, yet through mutual respect built a lasting friendship; something we all can learn a thing or two from. Flawed decision-making led to dire circumstances, but the compassion they had for other living beings, and an understanding of a human's need for relief from harsh conditions (in this instance, through delectable baked goods) is a refreshing reminder for us to be aware of other's needs.Despite the cries of boredom from some viewers, I found this art house piece from Michael Bay full of explosive bovine action: the scenes when our hoofed hero dashes headlong into mobs of knife-wielding thugs and thrashes them with her whip-tail; when our courageous cow leaps off of thatch-roofed structures and drops cow patties onto the masses of violent men; and especially the scene when First Cow uses her laser vision to disintegrate the covered wagons, shacks, outhouses, and feeding troughs of the human's makeshift village of idiots. True to form, Bay's direction in these action sequences is unsettling, confusing, yet ultimately satisfying.If you have even an inkling of desire to engage yourself in a film tackling the existential dilemmas of life on the western frontier, genuine themes of friendship and compassion, and large-scale napalm-like explosions all along the Oregon Trail, then this film comes highly recommended.",First Cow
