0,Leofwine_draca,Much better than I was expecting,7,13 July 2017,"MECHANIC: RESURRECTION is a sequel to the first film, which itself was a remake of an old '70s vehicle for Charles Bronson. Jason Statham returns as the bald-headed assassin for a new story in which he finds himself forced to assassinate a trio of targets in order to save a kidnapped woman. The story is nothing special, merely a template for lots of globe-trotting stylistics and plenty of well-directed action sequences.I notice this film has been panned by critics and audiences alike, but I feel puzzled and as if I saw a different movie. There's nothing majorly wrong with this movie. Sure, it's a little CGI heavy at times, but it has a lightness of touch that makes it a fun watch, and plenty of hard-hitting fight scenes that have great choreography. The opening fight, inspired by the likes of THE RAID 2, is by far the best part of the movie, and it never again quite reaches the same highs, but the rest is still engaging.Statham's kill missions are suspenseful and one of them has a jaw-dropping, laugh-out-loud denouement. Statham is his usual brooding presence and looks bad-ass with a beard, while Jessica Alba isn't too annoying. The villain is weak but Tommy Lee Jones has an amusing minor role as a quirky character. Best of the lot is Michelle Yeoh, underutilised yes, but it's still good to see her. MECHANIC: RESURRECTION is noisy and dumb, but also exciting and fast-paced. I really enjoyed it.",Mechanic - Resurrection
1,SnoopyStyle,lots of problems,4,3 April 2017,"Assassin Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) has been living in Rio after faking his own death. He is approach by Crain's associates for a job to kill 3 men. He manages to escape and hide out in Thailand with Mei (Michelle Yeoh). They find Gina (Jessica Alba) being abused. After rescuing her, she is kidnapped by Crain and Bishop is forced to take the job. The last target is Max Adams (Tommy Lee Jones).The movie jumps around a lot which leaves the flow disjointed. The bigger problem is that the wrong character gets kidnapped. Despite her hotness and her sob story, Bishop doesn't really know Gina. Crain would hold more power by kidnapping Mei. On the other hand, Gina would be much more compelling as a constant companion especially after already showing some fighting skills. Her back story is also wrong with her previous run-in with Crain. In addition, the first target is completely wrong. It's too easy to kill somebody in a prison. Crain could have infiltrated or hired some of the guards to have him killed, accidentally or not. I do like the opening wild action sequences like a Fast & Furious copy but it's downhill from there.",Mechanic - Resurrection
2,Prismark10,Needed a better service,4,31 March 2019,"Ace assassin Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is thought to be dead.In Mechanic: Resurrection Bishop has been tracked down in Rio de Janeiro. after faking his own death. His former associate Crain (Sam Hazeldine) sends some goons to force Bishop to do three assassinations and make them all look like accidents.Bishop fights them off and flees to Thailand where he comes to the rescue of abused Gina (Jessica Alba,) She is the bait that Crain kidnaps in order to force Bishop to carry out his tasks.This is a globe trotting action film, Brazil, Thailand, Australia, Bulgaria all enhanced with CGI. Some of the action scenes are fun such as the fight on the way to Sugar Loaf Mountain. The glass swimming pool job sticks out, but too much of the movie is generic and forgettable. The film grinds to a halt without the action scenes.",Mechanic - Resurrection
3,nogodnomasters,I spent all my life setting people up to die. I'm setting you up to live.,6,16 October 2017,"Bishop (Jason Statham) is found retired in Rio and is requested by Crain (Sam Hazeldine) to kill three people or his cover will be blown. He manages to escape to a remote location in Thailand where he is quickly discovered with Jessica Alba, who was planted there by Crain...against her will. After a one night stand, Crain captures the two of them and ""forces"" Bishop to assassinate three people or Jessica gets it. With Alba being the best squeeze on the market, Bishop succumbs. The swimming pool murder scene was a little better than the first one.The film has some minor twists at the end, but nothing major, being closer to a Seagal film, than ""The Usual Suspects."" Other than a bikini, Alba didn't bring anything to the screen as most of the acting was bland. Even Tommy Lee Jones phoned it in. And where does Bishop get a water proof cell phone that works anywhere in the world, even on remote islands? Guide: F-word, brief sex. No nudity",Mechanic - Resurrection
4,kosmasp,"By the numbers (1,2,3)",5,12 January 2017,"Have you seen the other Mechanic? It was better no doubt about that, but if you liked that, you will probably enjoy this too. And while I still haven't seen the Charles Bronson Mechanic yet, I don't think this will take away anything or add anything to this movie experience. There also seems no way that Jessica Alba will end up being convincing in her acting abilities anytime soon. But she is pretty.Story doesn't make sense (did you expect it to make any?) and there would've been a lot of other ways to resolve certain things. But you have to leave those things aside, otherwise you won't have any fun at all. And fun is what the movie wants to bring. Doesn't really succeed fully in it, but I've seen worse movies. If you like Statham and some nice action set pieces you will be entertained to a degree",Mechanic - Resurrection
5,jboothmillard,Mechanic: Resurrection,4,13 September 2020,"I watched the original, a remake of the film starring Charles Bronson, a few years, I saw the trailer for the sequel and had a feeling, despite looking fairly cool, it would be disappointing, but I decided to go with it anyway. Basically, since faking his death, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) has been living quietly in Rio de Janeiro. Renee Tran (Rhatha Phongam) is a courier who knows his true identity and approaches him. Her employer wants Bishop to kill three targets and make their deaths look like accidents. Bishop manages to escape her and the mercenaries and flees to Thailand. He stays at the resort island beach house of his friend, Mei (Michelle Yeoh), and learns that Tran is working for his former childhood friend Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine). Some time later, Gina Thornton (Jessica Alba), comes to Mei wanting aid for her bruises before returning to a boat anchored nearby, where Mei sees her being beaten by a man onboard. Mei calls Bishop, and together they rescue Gina. The two men fight, and Bishop accidentally kills the man, and is unable to identify him, after this he sets the boat of fire. While Mei tends to Gina's injuries, Bishop finds that Gina is also connected to Crain. She reveals that Crain had threatened the children's shelter in Cambodia that she runs unless she got close to Bishop in an effort to force him to do the assassinations. Over the next few days, Bishop gets to know Gina better and they fall in love. As expected, however, Crain's mercenaries arrive and abduct them. Crain keeps Gina hostage to ensure Bishop completes the assassinations. The first target is a warlord named Krill (Femi Elufowoju Jr.), who is being held in a Malaysian prison. Bishop gets himself imprisoned, and gains Krill's trust saving his life. Bishop then kills Krill himself and escapes with the help of Crain's operatives. The next target is Adrian Cook (Toby Eddington), a billionaire and former trafficker of underage sex workers. Bishop climbs Cook's penthouse apartment to evade the tight security, and breaks the glass bottom of his overhanging pool, sending Cook plummeting to his death. While giving details of the third target, Crain lets Bishop speak to Gina, who repositions the camera so that Bishop can identify Crain's boat. Bishop attempts a rescue, but Crain thwarts it and demands Bishop to complete the last assassination, giving him 24 hours. The final target is Max Adams (Tommy Lee Jones), an American arms dealer in Varna, Bulgaria. Bishop plans the job, but realises Adams is Crain's only major competition. Bishop instead approaches Adams to warn him and get his help. Bishop fakes Adams' death and reports to Crain that he was successful. Bishops is directed to Crain's submarine pen, where he decimates Crain's mercenaries then makes for Crain's boat. He fights off more of Crain's men and rescues Gina. He discovers the boat is rigged with explosives and puts Gina in a diving bell. Bishop kills the remaining mercenaries, then overpowers Crain and secures him to the boat. Crain and, seemingly, Bishop, are killed when the boat explodes. The remains of the boat are salvaged boat. Gina returns to Cambodia and to teaching and is surprised when Bishop appears. Adams discovers how Bishop survived and destroys the evidence in gratitude for sparing his life. Also starring John Cenatiempo as Jeremy, Anteo Quintavalle as Frank, and Bonnie Zellerbach as Headmistress. Statham is suitably tough, Alba looks great, and Jones is an interesting choice as a hipster arms dealer, it is fairly simple but also predictable story, but there are some set pieces and cool chase and explosive sequences that get your attention, just as silly as the predecessor, a daft but alright action thriller. Okay!",Mechanic - Resurrection
6,rmax304823,"Rolling, Speed, ACTION!",4,30 March 2017,"This shouldn't take long.Jason Statham is an experienced hit man. An evil doer kidnaps his girl friend, Jessica Alba, and demands that before she be returned Statham kill three extremely wealthy targets surrounded by armor and hundreds of armed body guards. Statham pulls it off with panache, except for the last target, Tommy Lee Jones, dressed like a medieval court jester and full of engaging wisecracks. With two down and one catch-and-release, Statham knocks off the kidnapping evil doer in the bargain. And for all of his impossible feats, not a drop of blood is drawn from Statham, who is in desperate need of a shave. A few years ago it wouldn't have been Statham in the lead, but Stallone, Schwarznegger, Willis, or Van Damme. It wouldn't have mattered.The number of shredded bodies must be up in the googles. No impossibility in their dispatch is spared. One falls through the bottom of a swimming pool that stretches out over the city streets from the penthouse of a Sidney skyscraper. Most are simply shot to death or blown to bits as Statham goes about his business in a black T-shirt that puts his cartoon-like muscles on display.Statham looks mean all the time. He tries to smile as he snuggles up with his girl friend at the end but we can almost hear the squeak of long-unused facial muscles. At the same time, it must be admitted that snuggling Jessica Alba is enough to make any man at least TRY to smile.You enjoy action movies? Then this is for you.",Mechanic - Resurrection
7,Tweekums,Fun action sequel with Jason Statham,7,19 August 2019,"After the events of the previous film hitman Arthur Bishop has faked his own death and retired to Rio de Janeiro where he lives under an assumed name. Unfortunately for him he is tracked down by people working for Riah Crain. Crain is an old friend turned enemy who wants Bishop to assassinate three people for him. Bishop manages to get away and move to an island off the Thai coast. Once again he is found; this time by a woman, Gina Thornton, forced to work for Crain. They fall in love then Crain's goons grab Gina and tell Bishop that if he doesn't take the job Gina will be killed. These hits will entail going after one man who is in an island prison off the Malaysian coast; another who lives in a secure penthouse in Sydney and finally a man who lives in a cold war era bunker in Bulgaria... then there is the problem that Crain might not keep his end of the deal.This film might not have a complex plot but it does serve to deliver a succession of exciting action sequences. This action is nicely varied with Jason Statham dispatching henchmen with knives, guns, grenades and his bare hands... there are a lot of henchmen that need dispatching! The main targets are each unpleasant in their own way so few viewers are likely to think Bishop is wrong to kill them to save Gina. Jason Statham is on fine form as Bishop; a fairly typical roll for him which should please fans. Jessica Alba is solid as Gina, getting in on the action a few times. Michelle Yeoh was somewhat underused and sadly took no part in the action... something that I'm sure will disappoint her fans. As is often the case in such films we are treated to a variety of stunning locations. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of good mindless action.",Mechanic - Resurrection

Jason Statham with his usual hard acting displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives . It's certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Statham's side in spite of being a cruel killer . Statham as a wealthy murderer for a powerful magnate offers the sort of strong acting as always. Furthermore, appears a nice secondary cast such as Jessica Alba as Bishop's love interest, but the romance isn't what this movie offers , it is about action and violence and director knows his work , as well as Sam Hazeldine , Michelle Yeoh , John Cenatiempo and special mention for veteran Tommy Lee Jones in a brief appearance as the millionaire Max Adams .

9,paul_haakonsen,Almost as good as the 2011 movie...,7,15 October 2016,"A sequel to the 2011 ""The Mechanic"", I was sort of thrilled to sit down and watch this 2016 movie, especially because I really enjoyed the 2011 movie quite a lot. ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" was actually a worthy follow up to the 2011 movie.Without being blinded by enjoying Jason Statham's movies, then it should be said that you know what kind of movie that you are in for here, as his movie are essentially made from the same recipe; much like Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van Damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone back in the day. But with that being said, then I will say that I enjoy these types of movies as I grew up with them, and Jason Statham rarely fails to deliver.The story in ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is about Arthur Bishop (played by Jason Statham) who has put his turbulent past behind him and is living a quiet life in Asia. But when Gina (played by Jessica Alba) is kidnapped, he is forced to complete three difficult assassinations in order to have her set free. But no one crosses paths with Bishop and lives to tell about it.Sure, the storyline was generic and predictable, as they usually are in movies such as this. But it was still very entertaining and enjoyable, because there is a lot of action throughout the movie, and it is kept in a very fast pace, which ensures lost of adrenaline and thrills.The acting in ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" was good. Sure, you know what you get here, but I did enjoy it.While ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is a fast-paced and entertaining movie, it was not fully up to par with the 2011 ""The Mechanic"" movie. But it was a close run.I am rating ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" seven out of ten stars.",Mechanic - Resurrection

11,LeonLouisRicci,Empty Entertainment...Fun in the Sun...The Lack of Creativity is Breathtaking,6,29 December 2016,"The Cliché is ""By the Numbers"". Here it is Literally ""By the Numbers"" that this Numbing Action-Fest Unfolds. Kill #1...Kill #2...Kill #3...Are You Asleep Yet? Probably Not. Because Jason Statham is one of those Mumbling Action Heroes that is Fun to Watch Ply His Trade. That Being ""Will Kick Ass...Will Travel"".This Travelogue is Set in Beautiful Locations. The Hand-to Hand Fights are Visceral and Not Overly Edited or Shaken. Stirred but Not Shaken, and if this Movie Reminds of James Bond it's because it's very much Like a James Bond Movie without the Humongous Budget.In Fact when the ""Mechanic"" Escapes from Atop a Lift High in the Mountains onto a Human Kite, there is a slight Twangy Guitar on the Soundtrack that Evokes 007. Probably an Intentional In-Joke.The Movie Looks Great, and Jessica Alba still Looks Great, but the same cannot be Said of Tommy Lee Jones. He Looks Awful.The Movie isn't Awful it's just Awfully Flat and Formulaic. Worth a Watch for Statham Fans and Action Enthusiasts, but the Potential is Wasted and Delivered so Dry it becomes like so much Bright and Shiny Wallpaper.

12,CinemaSerf,Mechanic: Dereliction,5,20 June 2020,"I really quite enjoyed the original ""Mechanic"" (2011) so was quite looking forward to this... unfortunately, despite a decent enough cast on paper - this is not a very good film. When Jason Statham's girlfriend is kidnapped he is charged by nemesis ""Crain"" (Sam Hazeldine) to carry out three nigh on impossible murders and then to make them look accidental. Now one of his tasks - with a bloke in a cantilever swimming pool 80 stories up was quite good - it reminded me a bit of ""Diamonds Are Forever"" (1971) and there is quite a quirky appearance from Tommy Lee Jones in some fun slippers, but otherwise this is an overly digitised, sanitised and poorly constructed sequel that really makes little use of the star, nor of Jessica Alba or Michelle Yeoh who shows up for about three minutes too. The effects are well executed, and the thing looks OK, but it has nothing to get your teeth into and it is episodic style is quite sterile. It also happens to feature possibly the ugliest super-yacht ever built. Let's not have a third...",Mechanic - Resurrection
13,zardoz-13,Jason and His Adversaries,8,28 August 2016,"So many allusions to the James Bond franchise occur in German director Dennis Gansel's explosive, slam-bang, actioneer ""Mechanic: Resurrection,"" that you wonder if brawny Jason Statham wasn't auditioning for the coveted role of Agent 007. Five years ago, Statham inherited the role of hired assassin Arthur Bishop from the late Charles Bronson in ""The Mechanic"" (1972), and Statham displayed more than enough gritty aplomb and compelling charisma to make you believe he could play Ian Fleming's British spy. Gansel's sequel to Simon West's ""The Mechanic"" (2011) boasts all the elements typically seen in a tense Bond thriller: exotic international locales, Adrenalin-laced action sequences set variously on land, sea, ship, and double-digit body count. Statham eludes a murderous, gun-toting dame in Rio de Janeiro by catching a ride on the roof of a cable car to scenic Sugarloaf Mountain. This scene evoked memories of ""Moonraker"" (1979) where Roger Moore's James Bond swapped blows with Richard Kiel's hulking Jaws atop a cable car. Later, Statham collaborates with a global arms merchant played by Tommy Lee Jones who owns at least two submarines armed with lethal weapons like the villain in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" Finally, in a scene after he hooks up with the bodacious Jessica Alba, a hard-bodied Jason Statham emerges from the surf looking like Daniel Craig in his first 007 outing ""Casino Royale."" Mind you, ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is no more a James Bond epic than it is a Tom Cruise ""Mission: Impossible"" extravaganza. Nevertheless, Statham performs stunts like either Bond or Ethan Hunt might and dispatches adversaries right, left, and center without pause. Compared to Simon West's Louisana-lensed ""The Mechanic,"" Gansel's belated sequel surpasses the original in several respects, mostly in the gunplay category. ""Mechanic Resurrection"" does something crucial that good sequels should; it provides audiences with more information about the characters. Anybody who remembers Jason Statham's first outing as Arthur Bishop in ""The Mechanic"" knows that Steve McKenna (Ben Foster of ""Contraband"") tried to blow him to kingdom come at a gas station. Of course, McKenna failed, but he didn't know what had happened until he got himself blown to bits when he tried to cruise off in one of Bishop's prize cars. McKenna sought to kill Bishop because he discovered that Bishop had killed his father Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland of ""The Hunger Games"") as part of a contract commissioned by the criminal syndicate that kept Bishop on its payroll. You don't know have to know any of this when you watch ""Mechanic: Resurrection,"" but a little knowledge never hurt anybody. At the end of ""The Mechanic,"" somebody found CCTV footage of Bishop rolling out of the truck before McKenna ignited that incendiary blast. For the record, Bishop never believed Harry had been guilty of what he was accused of doing by his high-level associate, Dean (Tony Goldwyn of ""Ghost""), who double-crossed not only Harry but also Bishop. Since this unfortunate mishap, our eponymous assassin has been on the lam. When ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" opens, Bishop has been hiding out in plain sight in Rio De Janeiro on his yacht for five months under an assumed name: Otto Sanchez. No sooner has Bishop gone to grab a brew at his favorite hang-out than a gal with a gun (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) and five henchmen confront him. She informs him her boss wants him to ice three rivals, but the killings must appear accidental. Bishop relies on his ingenious ability to improvise, and he escapes from them. Mind you, Bishop literally obliterates this restaurant during a fight with the thugs before clambering atop a Sugarloaf Mountain bound cable car. The thugs storm the cable car and blow holes in the roof, prompting our hero to dive off it and luckily land atop another girl out flying her hang glider for kicks. This opening scene is worthy of either a James Bond or an Ethan Hunt. Once he has eluded these pugnacious ruffians, Bishop travels to a remote collection of islands off the coast of Thailand. He goes back to see an old friend, Mei (Michelle Yeoh of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), and learns that a former friend requires his unique services. Along the way, Mei encounters a bruised and battered damsel-in-distress, Gina (Jessica Alba of ""The Fantastic Four""), who has been roughed up by her cruel boyfriend. Mei persuades Bishop to intervene on Gina's behalf, but Bishop inadvertently kills the boyfriend, Frank (Anteo Quintavalle of ""Hard Target 2""), after he boards the boat where the couple are quarreling. Initially, Bishop doesn't trust Gina. She confesses that she has been forced to seduce him because a ruthless criminal without a shred of morality, Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine of ""The Brothers Grimsby""), has terrorized the co-workers at a school that she runs in Cambodia for children victimized by the sex trade. Bishop shares with Gina that he was an orphan himself who was sold into slavery to an East End London mobster and trained to be a kid soldier. Bishop, it seems, escaped from the mobster, but his childhood pal Riah wasn't fortunate enough. Riah was punished for his part in Bishop's breakout, and Rian yearns for payback. He abducts Gina and bargains to release her if Bishop will kill three unsavory gents. Clearly, ""Survivor"" scenarist Philip Shelby and freshman co-scripter Tony Mosher have written a thoroughly convoluted thriller. The twists and turns make their screenplay look like a pretzel. The dialogue doesn't contain a quotable line, and most of the Rio de Janeiro CGI work looks mediocre. Nevertheless, ""We Are the Night"" director Dennis Gansel doesn't let this nonsense loiter during its nimble, white-knuckled 99 minutes. Gansel stages some daredevil fistfights and firefights that compensate for its contrived screenplay. The skyscraper swimming pool scene 76 floors up is breathtaking. Sadly, Michelle Yeoh and Tommy Lee Jones languish in supporting roles with little to distinguish themselves, while Statham tangles with inexhaustible adversaries. If you enjoy watching Jason Statham kick ass, ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is an ideal diversion.",Mechanic - Resurrection
14,oscaralbert,There was a movie in the 1900s or something . . .,8,1 September 2016,". . . with Demi Moore's father Dudley called ARTHUR. Jason Statham plays ""Arthur Bishop"" in MECHANIC: RESURRECTION. This begs the question: WHICH ""Arthur"" is more like Secret Agent 007--Bishop, or the earlier Art? I think that the first Art held his liquor better than this year's, which is an essential element of being Double Oh Seven. Art of the 1900s also was more observant toward the Rules of the British Realm. He'd never think of missing anything REALLY important to Queen and Country, such as Tea Time. On the other hand, Mr. Statham's Arthur is a prolific killer of dozens, as well as being a master at blowing things up. He also seems to attract a better class of women than the Older Art: Jessica Alba could practically pass for a Bond Girl (and I seem to remember that Michelle Yeoh actually WAS one). With Art the Younger hanging out near the James Bond Island in Thailand, when he's not off on side trips to Rio, Malaysia, Australia, and Bulgaria, it's pretty much of a toss-up as to which Art makes a Better Bond.",Mechanic - Resurrection

16,neil-476,Ronseal,6,2 September 2016,"Don't get me wrong - I like Jason Statham, and I know exactly what to expect from his films, and that's exactly what I got here. But there were two elements (aside from the utter predictability and complete lack of any surprises) which annoyed me.One was Jessica Alba's complete lack of screen presence. She's usually at least cute to look at - here she was drab and ordinary as well as unable to act. Awful.And the second was the fact that, for much of the second half, I might as well have been watching a shoot-'em-up computer game as Statham engaged in a linear progression taking out hordes of unnamed black-clad target-fodder in endless combat scenes which carried no suspense at all, because there was never any sense that Statham was in jeopardy no matter how many men came at him.Disappointing.",Mechanic - Resurrection
17,FlashCallahan,Picks up after a terrible pre-credit scene....,6,9 October 2016,"Hit-man Arthur Bishop is forced to come out of retirement and commit three difficult assassinations in order to rescue his kidnapped lover. The hardest part is that he must make all of the killings look like accidents......The first film was a fun throwaway action film, that pretty much sums up Statham's Filmography, they are nuts and bolts action films with at least three set pieces that display his ability in martial arts.So even though I was surprised that a sequel was in the works, I was kind of excited because it would be familiar territory and we don't have to bother with any kind of history for the main character as that was all sorted in the first instalment. Plus Alba is very easy on the eyes.And this is exactly what I got. Eventually....Because the opening sequence is one of the worst action scenes I have ever seen. It's almost as if they have shown the trailer for his next film and then start the film proper after the credits.This opener has some of the worst green screening, lethargic action, and some seriously bad acting. And to top it all off, it has one of the most unbelievable but altogether poor excuses for a stunt.Seriously, the opening of Die Another Day would be ashamed.Luckily the film really picks up from there, and the film consists of Michelle Yeoh playing Morpheus, him meeting Alba, her getting kidnapped, and then Statham interacting with three, more difficult than the last set pieces.It's almost like its a video game version of Taken meets 12 Rounds, but my gosh, is it a lot of fun. The stand out scene is the second kill with the swimming pool. The cinematography is first rate, as is the stunt work. And the payoff is hilarious.Tommy Lee Jones pops up on the third level, as the makers couldn't top the second set piece, so get special guest star in the mix, and he's okay, but totally irrelevant to the plot, but wears cool glasses.And to top it all off, the film has not one, but two scenes where Statham stealthily boards a boat and starts to kill everyone on it, but the bizarre thing about this is that it's the same boat!! Who's driving the boat?!!If your a Staham fan, it's more of the same, which isn't a bad thing, but they should have never put that pre-credit sequence in the film, it's terrible.",Mechanic - Resurrection

You get everything you want from this kind of movie - invincible hero and lots of action. Liked the way he planned and executed the hits. Really stunning filming in the exotic locations from Rio to a idyllic island in Thailand to Sydney to the Black Sea city of Bulgaria.Jason Statham is approaching 50 but he can still look convincing in his action sequences. Jessica Alba is still smashing in a bikini. High caliber supporting cast from the always serene Michelle Yeoh who is quite lovely as an old friend who runs a hotel in Thailand. Tommy Lee Jones is here too.The story is okay not convoluted or pretentious.

20,JamesHitchcock,Just don't look too closely at where its moral compass is pointing.,5,8 September 2016,"""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is a sequel to ""The Mechanic"" from 2011, which was in turn a remake of another film of the same name from 1972, but I must admit that I have never seen either of those films. If I had done I might have understood more of the beginning of this one, but it would appear that the main character, Arthur Bishop, is a former contract killer, now living quietly in retirement under an assumed name in Rio de Janeiro after faking his death. Only he has not faked his death well enough, and some people know he is still alive- people who have no intention of allowing him to continue living quietly in retirement. A man named Riah Crain 2016 makes contact with Bishop, asking him to kill three men and to make the deaths look like accidents. When Bishop refuses to cooperate, Crain kidnaps his girlfriend Gina to force him to do so.The film, like a number of tough-guy thrillers, shows the clear influence of the Bond franchise. It was shot in a number of exotic locations such as Rio (possibly chosen to tie in with the Olympics), Malaysia, Sydney and Varna, Bulgaria. (This last is not normally thought of as one of the world's most exotic cities, but possibly the Bulgarian Tourist Board had a stake in the film). Gina, played by the lovely Jessica Alba, is a heroine in the Bond Girl mode. (A former Bond Girl, Michelle Yeoh, also makes an appearance).What the Bond films have, however, and this film lacks, is a clear-cut sense of morality. Bond may kill people- the death toll in the average Bond movie can be quite high- but he does so in a good cause. He is essentially a soldier in a Just War, fighting to save democracy and civilisation from the forces of evil and chaos. Bishop is not. Admittedly, the three men he has been ordered to kill are all despicable individuals. Krill, currently incarcerated in a Malaysian prison, is a brutal African warlord and drug dealer. Adrian Cook, an Australian, is ostensibly a legitimate businessman, but the real source of his wealth is the human traffic in underage prostitutes. The third, Max Adams, is an American arms trader living in Bulgaria. Gina, by contrast, who when she is not being kidnapped runs an orphanage in Cambodia, is portrayed as an absolute saint, a younger, more glamorous version of Mother Theresa (albeit without the vow of chastity).Crain, however, does not want his enemies dead because he is a humanitarian eager to rid the world of three notorious evil-doers before they can do more evil. He has his own self-interested motives for wanting them out of the way. At one level Bishop may be killing in order to protect the woman he loves, but by doing so he is ultimately furthering the interests of a man every bit as evil as the men he kills. The film never really tries to resolve the moral dilemmas raised by this situation. Indeed, it generally ignores them and treats the story as just another action thriller with our hero overcoming tremendous obstacles, and performing the most unlikely feats of derring-do- another Bond trademark- in order to take out the bad guys.And, actually, at this level it succeeds rather well. Jason Statham has a limited range as an actor, but within that range he can be good, and has enough presence and charisma to make an impressive hero in an otherwise unimpressive film. (""The Transporter"" is another example of this ability). When Daniel Craig retires as 007, the producers could do worse than look to Statham as his successor. Unlike the Bonds, or at least the better ones, however, the film lacks a decent villain. Sam Hazeldine's Crain will never be a Goldfinger or a Blofeld. Most of his threats are uttered via intermediaries, and when he does make an appearance he seems a rather bloodless individual. As her character spends most of the film being held prisoner off-screen, Alba seems rather wasted.The action sequences, however, are well handled. The way in which Bishop disposes of Cook is particularly ingenious, if also particularly implausible even by the standards of this film. (Even more implausible is the idea of him getting away with it without the police at least suspecting that Cook's death may have been down to foul play. Did nobody notice Bishop acting suspiciously near the top of a skyscraper in a busy city like Sydney? And in broad daylight too?) ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is a reasonably exciting action-adventure movie. Just don't look too closely at where its moral compass is pointing. 5/10",Mechanic - Resurrection
21,KineticSeoul,"Basically ""Hitman"" with Jason Statham",5,23 October 2016,"This is just another Statham movie. It's not one of his top movies but not one of his awful ones either. It's like in the middle, so in another words it's watchable at best. Just about everything about this movie is so typical Statham and it's very predictable. I noticed that Statham movies are good when it goes balls to the wall crazy. Minus his only really dramatic and emotional film he was in called ""Hummingbird"". For the first time I could tell that Jason Statham is getting old. It seemed like the director tried to make it a throwback to the 90's action movies. But it just doesn't work in this, because nothing about the story or the action sticks out all that much. Maybe the swimming pool assassination scene but that is about it. I will say it's better than the ""Hitman"" movies. As a matter of fact this could have worked as a ""Hitman"" movie if they got the license from the company. It just seemed more like the ""Hitman"" games than the actual live action movies so far. Overall this follows the generic Statham formula, so if you like the generic Statham formula that brings nothing new to the table you just might enjoy it.5/10",Mechanic - Resurrection
22,Hellmant,"Extremely clichéd, and horrendously cheesy.",6,31 August 2016,"'MECHANIC: RESURRECTION': Three Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2011 action hit 'THE MECHANIC'; which is a remake of the 1972 flick (of the same name). The film once again stars Jason Statham, as the retired hit-man named Arthur Bishop (played by Charles Bronson in the original 1972 flick). In this installment, he's forced to come out of retirement and kill three criminals; in order to save the woman he loves. It was directed by German filmmaker Dennis Gansel; and it was written by Philip Shelby, Tony Mosher, Brian Pittman and Rachel Long. The film costars Jessica Alba, Sam Hazeldine, Michelle Yeoh and Tommy Lee Jones. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics (of course), but it is meeting the usual Jason Statham B-movie Box Office standards. I thought it was OK.Arthur Bishop (Statham) has been retired, and living under a fake name in Rio de Janeiro, for some time (after faking his death in the last movie); until he's visited by a mysterious woman (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam), and some mercenaries. They want Bishop to do a job for a secret employer. He refuses, and flees to Thailand. There he meets an abused woman named Gina Thorne (Alba). He falls for her, as he learns the mysterious employer wants him to; and when she's kidnapped, he's once again forced to murder three criminals (and stage their deaths as accidents). The movie is extremely clichéd, and horrendously cheesy (at times). It does have some decent actions scenes though, and Jason Statham doing what he does best. The celebrity supporting cast is mainly just there as extended cameos though, and their talents are wasted. I also wasn't impressed by Gansel's directing. The original remake was much better; I actually don't think I've ever seen the original 1972 film (possibly an edited version, on TBS, but I don't remember).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Xm22965_JOo",Mechanic - Resurrection
23,thesar-2,Resurrect His Career!,8,12 November 2016,"Annnd here's another sequel far too late and no one asked foror how I normally start reviews of movies such as this. Mercifully, while both statements are true, this is still a MUST-SEE.Mechanic: Resurrection is not just oodles better than the first one, but is possibly one of Jason Statham's best films to date. Yes, there are clichés abound. Yes, there's very little new here. And yes, it mirrors even a ton of his previous works. But, damnit, I haven't had this much fun since The Expendables 2 or the original Transporter. Basically and spoiler for the first Mechanic, he survived an assassination attempt and is now living out his retirement. Of course, he's called back to ""fix"" things, but he rejects the invite until he's given a (sorry, movie, only-on-paper) motivation to kill three men in his fashion of making them look like accidents. While the original Mechanic was good and wasn't terrible by any means, it just was very slow and had only an ounce of action that I yearn for in Statham films. Tons of talking, debating and its own clichés filled up that running time. It seems the pitch here to make a sequel years past its time included the promise of more guns, bad guys, action and missionsMission: Accomplished.These kinds of movies are simple. If you love Statham (I do) and you love action movies you don't need to think much in, this is for you. Personally, I loved the first two Transporter films, but balked at the over-silliness and terrible CGI. Luckily, you can escape those this time and just have a 90s style, action-packed thrill ride and never regret it.***Final thoughts: Too bad this made so little money in the USA. Definitely enough to warrant another chapter when you include its overseas take. Just a case of too-little, too-late in conjunction with ""who the hell was the Mechanic, anyways?"" mentality. Skip the box office talk and have yourself a fantastic Saturday night home with a double feature of this series' two gems. Especially since you'll end on a high note.",Mechanic - Resurrection
24,FeastMode,my notes,4,1 July 2019,Some cool scenes but pretty stupid overall (1 viewing),Mechanic - Resurrection
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Despite occasional fleeting enjoyment and the potential to be 'so-bad-its-good' for some people, this is a bad film that's not only generic and stupid but also boring as well.",3,1 September 2016,"'Mechanic: Resurrection (2016)' is the latest cinematic snooze featuring the never charismatic Jason Statham, sequel to the incomprehensible montage that was 2011's 'The Mechanic (2013)' - a film featuring seemingly less action than 'Sleepless In Seattle (1993)'. Is it better than the first one? Well, yes it is, but that doesn't mean it's any good. It is so generic and clichéd that it not only seems as though the writers ticked off every action movie trope in the book, but that they then proceeded to viciously beat the audience over the head with it. Seriously, I wanted this to be a fun time but it really isn't. Sure, there's some limited enjoyment to be had, but the majority of the film was just plain dull.As I said, the worst crime this movie commits is simply being boring. By the time it gets going you're already checked out, so anything that happens seems even less interesting. The plot - if you can call it that - is hackneyed, hokey and honestly absurd. The first act crawls along at a snail's pace and, once the film does settle into itself, the rest of the piece plays out like a poor excuse for a video-game. Statham receives a new objective accompanied by some very expositional (and often impossible, in a 'when was he told this?' kind of way) narration, does the task incredibly easily and then rinses and repeats. This repetition really hurts the proceedings, as nothing is unpredictable and it all feels too familiar. The best parts of the flick involve the eponymous 'mechanic' planning and executing these missions, but all of them come across as a walk in the park despite the thing's attempts to convince us they are quite the opposite. A lot of the plans rely too much on coincidence and contrivances to be convincing, with a lot of what happens being laughably trite and candidly stupid. On top of that, some scenes exist for no real reason and often feel very inconsequential. There is occasional enjoyment if you are prepared to revel in the general silliness of it all, and some people may find it 'so bad, it's good' (a woman in my screening was consistently laughing at the more outlandish moments).The acting, or lack thereof, is some of the worst I've seen all year. Jessica Alba is more wooden than a pirate's false leg and Tommy Lee Jones has 'pay-check' written across his forehead in bold letters. Statham himself isn't bad when he isn't speaking; he is physically convincing and comes across well in the action scenes. Every time he opens his mouth as this character, though, I just want to yawn. To be fair, that probably isn't his fault this time as he has to deliver some honestly awful dialogue in one of the year's worst screenplays. He isn't an inherently bad actor (I've seen him give better performances), but he has so little to work here that it's almost inevitable he comes across as a poor screen presence. Some lines are downright cringe-worthy while others are either boring or genuinely annoying. The characters are seriously undercooked and two-dimensional, as well. We get the typically mundane 'British bad guy', the generically mean main-henchman, the overdone 'retired assassin brought back into the game' premise and the monotonous kidnapping/ black-mail combo commonly seen as an excuse for a belated sequel. There's not a lot to like in the script, even the (hopefully) purposely cheesy one-liners lack in impact. I don't get a sense of self-awareness or satire from the flick, even if the filmmakers may try to retroactively convince us that was the intention, and thus don't feel any real joy at any point. It never provokes a smile, but always provokes a face-palm.Technically, the film is mainly competent despite some jittery and occasionally muddy cinematography. The action sequences aren't egregious, but they lack any real impact and cut frequently at odd moments. There is also some obvious speed ramping, noticeably artificial camera tricks and several skipped frames. The hand-to-hand is where this is most apparent, with the longer scenes feeling a little tiresome and technically unsound. The shorter moments of close combat work well, especially when mixed with the surprisingly efficient gunplay - which looks decent most of the time and is framed a lot better than the fisticuffs. A lot of lead is slung, and a lot of people provide ample targets for it, but ultimately the shooting lacks any real impact as wave after wave of speechless meat-bags pile on top of one another in a hilariously inept fashion. There is occasional and fleeting enjoyment during these scenes, though, especially when the focus is firmly on the excessive action. The movie's CGI here is really rather poor, with every explosion being either an obvious piece of stock-footage or a mid-2000s level 'fume' particle effect. In either case, they are poorly implemented into the live action, with overt wirework and weak on-set interaction compounding their unbelievable nature. There is some hazy green-screening as well, which look as though someone keyed out the green and then cranked the feather setting up to 100 - either that, or they slathered the screen with enough Vaseline to completely undermine Ice Cube himself. It may have just been me, but I also noticed some artefacts in a couple of shots: small black cubes and minor pixilation. It feels like the shots in question were unfinished but rushed into the final product anyway. The music is really bad, too, with the theme being incredibly cheesy and sometimes out of place.Overall, 'Mechanic: Resurrection (2016)' is a bad movie. It's poorly structured, often boring and generally uninspired. Plus, it's being blatantly stupid and excessively generic. The dialogue is terrible, the plot is nonsensical, the acting is phoned-in and the CGI sticks out like a poorly-rendered thumb. There is some limited and fleeting enjoyment in the action set-pieces, and some people may like it in a 'so bad, it's good' kind of way, but I don't enjoy it wouldn't recommend it: 3/10.",Mechanic - Resurrection

27,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,14 November 2016,"Mechanic: ResurrectionBefore you go and resurrect a retired mechanic remember that there's a huge service fee attached.

28,tabuno,Becomes more and more by the numbers,6,27 January 2019,"This movie starts out really well, nice execution of energy and action. There are some nice parallels at this point with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in Bourne Supremacy (2004). Jason Statham's martial art or fighting form at this point is even more fascinating for its more realistic street style. Yet as the movie proceeds along, it becomes more and more by the numbers as even the odd, unnecessary use of a villain kidnapping and the attempted rescue on a large boat only seems to detract from the action. Jessica Alba gets to do a bikini reversal of the famous Ursula Andress reprise from James Bonds' Dr. No (1962). Statham's Arthur Bishop's intriguing use of weapons and bomb, however becomes more boring and tedious and even supposedly this assassin kills don't seem to have the riveting death scenes as even the mechanics don't have the same thrill as say Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible exploits. The movie eventually settles down by kill by the bullets eventually and unlike Hitman: Agent 47 (2015) the energy and power seems to fizzle more and more until a more pedestrian ending occurs.",Mechanic - Resurrection

30,Reno-Rangan,"Falling in love is a trap, but some men risk everything for it.",6,24 November 2016,"This is an unexpected sequel. Actually, I was looking for other sequels from Statham's filmography, particularly the third 'Crank'. I think the idea of going for it was good and the film was not that bad, if your purpose of a watch is time pass. The story was so bad, but the filmmaking was excellent. Because it was made by a renowned German director. Only if he had got a better script, the outcome would have been different. So it's the actors and the director makes it watchable. Other than that, this film falls into the average category.The story follows after Arthur Bishop was found living in Brasil by some people who know him. Then he narrowly escapes from there and lands in Southeast Asia, where he meets Gina, a woman struggling from domestic violence. But he soon discovers that's a setup. After she was taken captive by an international criminal, now he has to follow his instruction to set her free. So the action begins where he takes a series of missions across the globe and how it all ends follows in the rest of the narration,It's good to see Jason Statham back to his signature role. This is what he's good at. Even if the story is not good, that's okay, because Statham's presence is a very comfortable to watch without any trouble. Jessica Alba as well, I haven't seen her in any major hit film at the recent time. Even though the film was received below average, it kind of puts them both back on the track.Definitely they both needed this breakthrough. There's a third film is coming, it's not official yet, but the conclusion was a hint where Tommy Lee Jones can be seen in an important role in the next part.

Once again Statham takes on the role of Bishop, a skilled assassin who niche is his ability to make it look like his marks were killed by accident. ""Retired"" since the last movie, Bishop is forced back in the biz by a frenemy called Crian.And the clichés begin real quick (Well the movie actually begins with Statham kicking some much needed ass in a boss action sequence using the backdrop of Brazil). Bishop is set up by Crian to fall for a battered woman, played by Jessica Alba, and despite knowing what Crian is up to, purposely pointing out the flaw in this action movie cliché, Bishop falls for it, and now has to work for Crian to get her back when she's kidnapped.Though the Mechanic is suppose to be this real cleaver assassin in his ability to get in and create a death trap for his victims, I have to say, the traps go by too fast to seem cleaver at all, but I did not go to this movie to see Statham be cleaver, I went to see him be bad ass, and he does this in-between missions.It's not the best action sequences I've seen Statham do, not by a long shot. As a matter of fact, the action starts strong and strangely gets weaker as the story goes by. Not to the point where they suck but you will notice the dwindle in quality.Jessica Alba plays perfect eye candy in this film. I'm a little surprise that after such a long time of not acting that she would pick a role like this, but if you only want to see how well Jessica Alba aged (or rather has not) than this is the movie.I'm mostly disappointed that Michelle Yeoh (My personal eye candy) did not do much but stand around as well. I know she's aged (Still looks good), but I would have loved to see her just take on one room full of bad guys using a coconut or something (She plays a beach resort owner who is an old friend of Bishop's), but I guess Statham really needed all the action scenes for himself.There is another star in the film but even though he has a key part as one of the Mechanic's marks his part it too small to be played by someone as big as he.The Mechanic: Resurrection is something you'd expect to go Straight-To-Video (Or whatever the kids called that type of movie these days) ,with it's cliché story arch you see in every action movie ever, and it's simple action parts, but hey, it's Jason Statham!

The premise of the film sees after somebody he cares about is kidnapped Arthur bishop is forced to go after three targets. As mentioned before Jason statham plays the lead in this film and you get what you expect, he is very brooding in this and plays the tough guy well, which helps sell him in the action scenes. However, I found his character to be way more interesting in the first film and I felt him to just be there with me not caring about him in this film. The supporting cast is big let down, Jessica alba plays his love interest in this film and she is simply eye candy not providing much more then that, it doesn't help that her and statham don't really have any chemistry together in this film. Tommy lee Jones has a small role in this film and if his role had been expanded it might have worked but he just wasn't given enough time to get his performance across. The villain is the ultimate cliché and feels like they didn't even care to try and think of a compelling villain for this film. The story is also as cliché as you can get, it feels pretty repetitive as statham goes for his targets and I just ended up not caring about anything story related in this film. The script has some pretty cheesy dialogue in it and all I'll say is that I didn't care about any of the drama and I never laughed so this script truly failed.

I find what Bishop encounters in this film much more riveting than what happens in the 2011 production, it's class watching him go piece by piece; even if you have a fair idea what's going to happen.The aforementioned lead is notably joined by Tommy Lee Jones (Adams), Jessica Alba (Gina) and Michelle Yeoh (Mei). The latter two are unfortunately pretty basic characters, but Jones is very good in his role - I love the look and behaviour of Adams, entirely thanks to the actor himself. Sam Hazeldine (Crain) isn't a great villain, mind... kinda dull in fact.I always enjoy seeing films travel the world, as this visits numerous countries including Brazil, Malaysia, Australia and Bulgaria - it allows the story to feel global, as opposed to being limited to a random American state. I like the music, also.This beats its predecessor, which I did enjoy by the way. I'm not saying it is anything incredible, or even one of Statham's best, but all I can state is that I had a fun time.",Mechanic - Resurrection
41,kirbylee70-599-526179,Slick Statham,8,22 November 2016,"I'm surprised at the career of Jason Statham. When he began it appeared that he would be on a meteoric rise to stardom comparable to the likes of Stallone and Willis. And yet while he continues to make movies at a steady pace the results are not near the level they should be. It puzzles me because each movie he makes has been excellent when it comes to action fare and more so when you watch things like REVOLVER, a personal favorite of mine.When Statham took on the challenge or recreating the role of Arthur Bishop made famous by Charles Bronson I thought it was a perfect match. Both men had a rough good looks and handled themselves well in action films. The film did well and seemed to raise Statham but who would have thought a sequel would be in the works, even more so when *SPOILER* the character dies at the end of the film. So color me surprised when this film came out.MERCHANIC: RESURRECTION returns Bishop to the world of the living, taking it easy on a cabin cruiser in Rio only to find himself set upon by an old friend turned adversary. The film opens with an operative working for Crain, the ex-friend, telling Bishop he needs his set of skills for three killings. If you didn't know already, Bishop was the perfect anti-hero, a hit man with a conscience who could make any murder seem natural. Refusing to take the job, Bishop takes on the operative and her henchmen, escaping and heading off to a secluded island in the South Pacific.Under the protection of Mei (Michelle Yeoh), Bishop leads a simple life. Then one day a woman names Gina (Jessica Alba) shows up on the island, bruised by the brute of a man she's sailed there with. When it appears the man is about to kill her, Mei asks Bishop to step in. He does so ending in the death of the man and Gina taking up residence on the island. It isn't long before she tells him her back story and reveals to him that she was sent by Crain to bring him back. Not by choice though as Crain is using the school of young girls in Cambodia where she was working as hostages. When Crain's men show, Bishop obliges him.Crain tells Bishop he wants him to use his unique abilities to take out three targets. Only giving him enough information to handle one at a time, he first sets Bishop to a Southeast Asian island prison, an impassable location with little hope of getting in and out of let alone killing someone inside the prison. Let's be serious, if this assassination failed then we'd be watching a very short film. With each target assigned to Bishop he moves closer to freedom for Gina, but only if he trusts Crain. He does not.The movie works on a number of levels. To begin with Statham does a great job of portraying the calm, cool collected character of Bishop to the max. Bishop is all business on the surface but there is more than that cool exterior to the man. He is a knight errant, a man with a soul who tries to steer clear of battles that are not his but who will step forward when he sees a damsel in distress. He can't help himself. It adds levels that many action starts find difficult to pull off but that Statham does with ease.The character of Bishop is a fascinating one in the way he works as well. Not only is he a cold killer when the need arises he is meticulous when it comes to how he carries out his tasks. Bishop makes plans and then goes over them again and again, looking for the cracks in the wall that his targets all have somewhere. He uses those faults to drive a wedge in that results in their demise. While some use just a gun in hand, Bishop uses a pictures, calipers and high tech gadgets he can purchase anywhere in pure form and then adapt for his needs. While Bishop has the hand to hand skills and weapons that he uses to take out a target, it is his mind that is the deadliest weapon he possesses.The supporting cast here does a fine job as well but in truth the word supporting describes them quite well. Statham takes center stage from start to finish here. Alba does a great job in her role, showing that she's not a one note actress or just a pretty face. She carries off the role of Gina quite well making her a sympathetic character caught in the middle of thigs who falls for a man who once made a living killing people. Now his skills come into play to help her.The movie is rated R for language and violence. Had they dropped out a few words my guess is it would have rated a PG-13 but action films feel the need to have that R rating there in order to draw more viewers or so they think. It doesn't matter in the long run. What does matter is that Statham has turned in another great action film that entertains from beginning to end.",Mechanic - Resurrection
42,lukem-52760,AWESOME ACTION PACKED THRILLER & ONE OF STATHAM'S BEST FILMS!!!,7,28 April 2020,"Jason Statham is Awesome & one of the best out there making these old school type action Thriller flicks just like Schwarzenegger, Stallone & Van Damme would've made back in the day & Statham fits in with the Action Legends now in his own right.Statham is back as the best of the best contract killer, Arthur Bishop & this time he's made to take out three big league targets for an old enemy of his & to assure he does as he's told, they've captured his new love, the beautiful Jessica Alba.
This sequel hit like the excellent ""Equalizer 2"" as a film that i put off watching for ages because i thought no way will it be as good as the first film & seemed like they was just trying to make a franchise out them for the sake of it but i was so wrong with both sequels because i ended up loving the sequels more than those Excellent first films!!!
""Resurrection"" is a fantastic slick & beautiful looking Action Thriller that often feels like a fun Spy film in the style of of ""James Bond"" a little as our pumped up hero is super smart & quick thinking & gets into the most secure places easily like a super spy but of course he's not, he's a super Assassin & is one of if not, Statham's best characters.
This fast-paced non-stop action fest has it all with beautiful locations & tropical waters & breathtaking stunts & action set pieces. The Action is quick & bone cruchingly fun with Statham kicking Ass the skilled way he does & plenty of gun play too.
Resurrection is definitely one of the most pure enjoyable & fun action films of Statham's Career & bringing a higher level of quality to this slick action film is a nice role for the ageing Hollywood legend, Tommy Lee Jones & he's Awesome here as an Arms dealer with morals & Jones gives him a likable quality even though he's basically a wacky bad guy but shares some nice scenes with Statham & just lifts the film up by his presence, i smiled whenever he was on screen.All in all this fun sequel is more entertaining & more re-watchable than it's grittier first film. Had a great time watching this thrill ride & is my favourite Statham film next to ""The Meg""",Mechanic - Resurrection
43,TdSmth5,Great sequel,8,5 February 2017,"Turns out that Bishop didn't die at the end of the first movie. Surprise, surprise. He's living the good life Brazil under a different name. But of course the bad guys catch up with him at a restaurant/bar. Their employer, Crain, wants Bishop to do three hits, but he's not interested and a thrilling scene ensues with him escaping.He ends up in Thailand were a friend helps him out. This friend sees a girl appear who shows signs of abuse and implores Bishop help the girl out who's on a ship off the coast. Bishop reluctantly agrees when they hear her screams. He gets on the boat and ends up killing the abusive husband and takes the girl to his place. He's a bit suspicious and for good reason. Crain did send the girl to track him down, but she's also doing it against her will. Soon enough Crain's thugs appear and grab the girl. Now Bishop has no choice but do the hits.The first is against an African arms dealer in a Malaysian jail. Bishop does his thing and makes it look like an accidental death. Next is an arms dealer in Australia living and working in his fancy high rise. Afterwards, and with the girl's help, Bishop decide to take on Crain but fails. So he does have to take out the third guy, some arms dealer living in a Bulgarian communist monument. And of course Bishop will have to find a way to rescue the girl and get rid of Crain whom he knows very well from his youth.It's good to see a sequel go way beyond the first movie. Mechanic aims and reaches the next level, taking it closer to Bourne/Bond level. There's the globalist globe-trotting that many movies aspire to these days. And we do get to see some cool sights in Brazil, Thailand, and Bulgaria. The intro scene is very thrilling, but things go downhill from there with the romance in Thailand and pick up again for the Australia mission. I would go so far as saying that we haven't seen this much Statham signature action since Transporter I. But Mechanic: Resurrection suffers from some odd dissonance in that it lacks a cohesive feel. Perhaps because for some reason there are 3 editors or because the second unit director ended up having a far too preponderant role in a heavy action movie. The villain isn't particularly evil. The story is of course nothing special but in telling the story we get tons of cool action and scenery. Mechanic: Resurrection is an excellent sequel and I hope it turns out to be franchise.",Mechanic - Resurrection
44,s3276169,Mechanic needed.......,4,18 October 2016,"The reason I enjoyed the first Mechanic film is the reason I have little time for Mechanic: Resurrection. The first film wasn't doing anything that had not been done before. There's no crime in that. Most action films draw on a finite pool of ideas. The reason the original worked, for me, is the story was well considered and the action scenes made sense. The net result, a satisfying action film that felt polished and complete. By contrast, the latest outing, in my opinion, holds together about as well, as a $100 dollar motorbike. The story line and action scenes seem hurriedly bolted together, with little consideration paid to consistency in the story and the action, that flows from it. All in all, a waste. The casting is on the mark and some of the promising action scenes could, I believe, have worked better, had a little more care and attention been paid to the overriding story and narrative. Four out of ten from me.",Mechanic - Resurrection
45,peterp-450-298716,You can enjoy Statham's fighting moves in this simple action flick. That's it!,4,8 December 2016,"""I spend my whole life settin' people up to die Let's set you up to live.""Believe me, I'm an avid fan of Jason Statham and won't refuse to watch a film in which his muscularity appears. In addition, I also realize that a real Jason Statham movie won't ask much effort from your brain. Most of his films are brainless movies in which a lascivious, well-formed beauty occurs from time to time. In addition, Statham's talents as an action figure and practitioner of martial arts is extensively demonstrated in these movies. And that's exactly what you can admire in ""Mechanic: Resurrection"". The film has just begun and Statham already needs to dig up his fighting techniques. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is of a pitifully low level. It's rather a mind below zero movie with a totally meaningless and paper thin story, ridiculous developments and forced interactions between the main actors.Well, there's always something to complain about. Statham playing a character part as in ""Hummingbird"" with less emphasis on the action, is also a reason for some to start grumbling. And in this movie there's a lot of fighting going on. But isn't that actually the main reason why we watch a Staham movie? Those brutal fight scenes where he uses every attribute he can lay his hands on? An absence of high quality dialogues and his static facial expression is part and parcel. The problem lies in the overarching story interwoven with the three subplots. The three murders Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) has to commit in a sinecure way (so that it looks like an accident) have been worked out masterfully. It's like watching three ""MacGyver"" episodes. And the second one is the most hallucinatory and impressive one.The movie's weaker half is the romantic part where Statham needs to show his sensitive side. He can use his triceps and biceps convincingly. But this stands in stark contrast to the use of his heart muscle. It seems rather contrived. However, if you look at the appearance of Jessica Alba, you totally understand that the adrenaline in Statham begins to function in a very different way. Alba is a beautiful appearance and luckily (for the male audience) there are many exotic beaches used as a scenery, making it mandatory for her to walk around and swim in bikini. Sadly, her part is limited to playing as a bait for Bishop. And obviously she demonstrates her feminine vulnerability constantly. Until a fury in her emerges and suddenly she masters effective combat techniques.Ultimately, ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is just a pure action movie that serves as demonstration material for Statham's ability as an action figure. The landscapes are beautifully portrayed. The three murders technically may not really be feasible, but are still imaged in an ingenious way. Jason Statham plays the cool guy who's forced to rescue the damsel in distress. Jessica Alba looks appetizing. And Tommy Lee Jones shines as wealthy arms dealer who has the appearance of an old hippie. These are all the positive remarks in a nutshell. If you have no problem with the fact they've put the focus in this movie solely on the mindless action moments and the rest is nothing more than an empty box, you'll be safe with this film.

46,valleyjohn,A resurrection we could have done without,4,10 October 2016,"The best way I can describe my feelings about Jason Statham movies is that they are a guilty pleasure. Sure they are dumb for the most part but on the other hand they are entertaining. Mechanic:Resurrection breaks that rule. It's still dumb but this time it's really really dull. Statham returns as Arthur Bishop who is forced into carrying out a series of seemingly impossible assassinations to save his girlfriend played by Jessica Alba. The first half hour of this feels like a vanity project. We see Statham and Alba going in and out of the sea , James Bond style , in exotic locations looking like they have just come out of the gym. It's cringeworthy at times. It's obvious that they have both got themselves in good shape for the film but do we have to have it rubbed in our faces? The rest of the film is a series of action sequences with below par special affects mixed Jessica Alba pulling silly faces pretending badly that she is in peril. This is probably the worst thing I have seen Statham do and to be fair I would rather see Harold Bishop than Athur Bishop if it means me sitting through something like this again.",Mechanic - Resurrection

This was pretty good action sequel to the 2011 Original!The film follows Arthur Bishop who wanting to live a quiet & easy life is brought out of hiding & threatened to be killed if he doesn't assassinate 3 targets which have to look like accidents! But there's a catch in the plan & Arthur must take out those who have tried to get him killed!I found the film to be pretty action packed! I'd say it's just as good as the first film!

49,bkrauser-81-311064,Absolute Rubbish,4,25 August 2016,"Mechanic: Resurrection doesn't need to exist in any way shape or form. Let's get that off the bat right away. In fact, The Mechanic (2011) didn't need to exist, yet like washed up ambergris or a second season of Reaper (2007-2009), it just showed up one day. Now we have another one only this time instead of a grizzled revenge story, this second helping of the sordid life of Arthur Bishop (Statham) involves a soapy romance and a brother against brother story so recycled it might as well be compost.Since last we saw him, Bishop has been keeping a low profile living in a modest yacht off the harbor of Rio de Janiero. That is until an old villain named Crain (Hazeldine) tracks him down and asks him to take out three people and make them look like accidents. To up the ante, Crain uses a clichéd do-gooder named Gina (Alba) as a carrot in a plot-line that should have come across calculated but just comes across as silly. With no choice, Bishop's unique set of skills are put to the test, pitting him against some of the most vile humans on the face of the earth.Now let's face it, a movie like this shouldn't exactly be plot- heavy. What anyone can reasonably expect is some close-quarters brawling, kinetic gun-play, massive explosions and kick-butt one- liners all to the tune to a soundtrack of pure bluster. Plus, given the amount of supervillain flunkys dying horrifically and shooting for s**t, it's pretty much a given the script for this film was in a producer's back-drawer somewhere marked ""Arnold Schwarzenegger Vehicles"".Yet Mechanic: Resurrection tries to be so much smarter than it really is. The intricate planning of each of the protagonists marks demands audience attention, painstakingly creating a collage of premeditation. Yet with each passing moment, it becomes clear that Bishop's meticulousness is less a character detail than a plot device; an excuse to be showy for showy's sake. It's like the film is trying to be A Colt is My Passport (1967) but doesn't have the benefit of having anything interesting to say so it just regurgitates something resembling a low-rent Mission: Impossible (1996-2015).Mechanic: Resurrection writes a check it simply can't check, providing a-typical action sequences that include a gondola top brawl, a Devil's Island-type prison break and an amphibious assault of a luxury yacht...twice. The shoddiness of the film shows itself most plainly with each successive explosion which look like they were made by Final Cut Pro students for a senior editing project. The supposed showstopper is Jason Statham grappling against the bottom of a penthouse pool, yet while he was dangling there with superhuman swagger one can't help but think, there's got to be a simpler way to do this and for god-sake light the green screen better!If fun can be had from Mechanic: Resurrection it's purely unintentional. The fighting choreography is solid though much of its impact is spoiled by flippant gore and rudimentary gun-play. The clichéd romance between Bishop and Gina is syrupy enough to coax giggles, that's if the first twenty minutes of their Thai coast courtship doesn't put you to sleep. Finally, while Bishop is painted as a smart, strong and resourceful character, his actions are commonly anything but. He's pretty much like the scimitar wielding thug in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981); he's flashy sure but next to any audience member with a brain, he's only fun when he's unceremoniously shot down.",Mechanic - Resurrection

53,Richie-67-485852,Let this NOT Resurrect,5,3 June 2017,"This is what happens when people do things exclusively for the money. Jason Stratham the star is a player in the movie industry and has made some impressive films based on his ability to make fighting look good. I remember him in an interview emphasizing how he is in it for the money or something to that affect and I thought nothing wrong with that as long as it is a win-win. He managed to hold my attention steadily until this movie. At first, I was intrigued expecting to see him do his thing but then I saw how he took his niche and just maxed it out as in more bang for the buck in a shoot it all up anything goes yahooooo I was disappointed.. Of course the viewers get the bang he gets the buck. It starts to get a little old when you get into the movie as we are asked to believe that anything he wants to do he does and mind you, he has no super powers either! That's taking it a bit too far but it manages to hold your attention until 2/3 into the movie where you might find yourself wishing he dies or the movie ends. In other words, overload on the premises of super-fighter never gets a scratch and always wins. I couldn't help think about Daniel Craig's James Bond who doesn't push it too far and he still needs luck to come out and not just movie magic even though you wonder but its done in a subtle way. The Bonds prior to that sort of got corny and comic bookish only because they couldn't do martial arts. Here, he does martial arts until you wonder how long can you keep this up? That's where the viewer gets tired and wants out. Perhaps Stratham wants out too but with all the movie money he can garner? How about leaving with class? Give us some fine performances, good story and memorable scenes so we can have fond thoughts of your career. You already have the money. Here's an idea. Time-out may help Jason here. He may get bored, want to do another flick and insist on quality or no deal. Lets hope so. Is this worth seeing? Yes only because he does do a nice fight scene but if he always wins against all odds without effort and never gets a scratch or can't be stopped, maybe he should start his own comic book. The woman in the movie doesn't capture your heart and I find it hard to believe it captures his on screen too. Story is weak and well enough said...See it so you can say ...Yes, I saw it. Popcorn will help here to keep you satisfied when the movie doesn't plus a tasty drink",Mechanic - Resurrection
54,drjgardner,Seen it all before,4,2 September 2016,"Apparently Hollywood is completely out of ideas. How else to explain this film?

The hero stabs/shoots/kicks/hangs/blows up and otherwise creates mayhem, and no one else in his path can shoot, throw a knife, or otherwise match his skills.

55,phubbs,Mechanic: Resurrection,5,28 February 2017,"The first movie was a remake of the classic 1972 Charles Bronson thriller starring Jason Statham...and was reasonably acceptable to remake, I guess. Of course they then got carried away (as always happens) and thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel to said remake...of the original 1972 classic. Now everyone knows this would all end in tears and complete failure...accept the makers of this movie it seems. So once again we have yet another movie all about a super agent type bloke that is virtually invincible and that's about it. Bishop (Statham) is now living in Brazil after faking his death in the last movie. He is approached by some bad guys who work for another bad guy (Crain played by some bloke called Sam Hazeldine) who wants Bishop to kill three specific people. Bishop refuses, a fight breaks out, Bishop wins and escapes. Bishop is now living in Thailand (as you do) when he rescues a sexy blonde (Jessica Alba) from some drunk bloke. Turns out she has been blackmailed by Crain to meet up with Bishop and seduce him so Crain could then fake her kidnapping so he would carry out the hits. Well low and behold, in time, Bishop and Gina (Alba) do fall for each other and low and behold Crain's goons turn up and kidnap them both. Now Bishop must carry out the three hits to save his new girlfriend...zzzz.Seriously could this be anymore clichéd and predictable? Who wrote this? How did they even get paid for this unoriginal tripe?? How did this even get a green light for f*cks sake?! For starters this doesn't feel like an action flick, oh no, this feels more like a holiday destination video. The camera work is honesty stunning, Thailand, Rio, Sydney, Malaysia etc...all look beautiful, wonderful. If you're watching this on a good TV in 1080p, 2K, 4K or whatever, then these exotic locations will burst through your screen into your living room in bright, sharp, crisp, vivid colours. I lost all interest in the films plot and was more interested in the possibility of going to one of these places for my next holiday. What's more all the scenes on the beach in Thailand are enough to make you sick. The most perfect beaches you've ever seen in your live, the most perfect weather, and everyone in shot is tanned and beautiful (with the exception of Statham perhaps).What actually happens in the movie is of course ridiculous and crap, but that really shouldn't be any surprise. For Bishop's first hit he must infiltrate a prison in Malaysia, well get himself locked up. He does this by acting drunk and being a bit rude to a Malaysian cop. Apparently this is enough to get you banged up in this horrendous maximum security prison that looks like it holds the type of people that have eaten someone. All these hits have to look like accidents by the way, as you can guess this doesn't really seem to happen in my opinion. Pretty sure the first hit would look like someone strangled and suffocated the guy...because that's what he did.The second hit is what you see on the movies poster. It involves Bishop having to scale the outside of a skyscraper in order to break a glass bottom swimming pool that overhangs the building. In all honesty this is probably the best part of the movie because you see a lot of technical hit-man type jiggery-pokery as Bishop works out how to make it look like an accident, and then how he manages to scale the outside of the building. But Tom Cruise this ain't, its all greenscreen and CGI. Once again the hit goes without a flaw but I'm pretty sure the guy could have gotten out of the pool in time.In between all these Bishop does try to rescue Gina from Crain's super posh yacht out at sea. He locates the yacht, gets on-board and manages to wipe out a good number of faceless henchmen. Alas he is eventually caught, given a good slap with some verbal from Crain, and then sent on his merry way to carry out hit number three. So basically, this entire rescue sequence was completely and utterly pointless filler that didn't amount to anything.The last stage on this video game escapade sees Bishop going up against arms dealer Max Adams played by a very old Tommy Lee Jones. In order to make Jones look somewhat hip and trendy he wears bizarre clothing, some stupid coloured circular glasses and has some earrings. But because Jones is an A-list star they can't just have him killed off, so he teams up with Statham's Bishop to take on Crain. This naturally leads to the big final showdown on Crain's posh yacht where Bishop this time wipes out all of the faceless henchmen and (spoilers!) kills Crain. He does this without really breaking sweat or taking any injuries because he's got his invincibility cheat code switched on. You wanna see a one man army situation, well it doesn't get much more one man army than this crapola.I think you gotta be a hardcore Jason Statham fan for this one. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good action flick and I've got nothing against Statham, but the man makes the same sh*t over and over and over again. He's becoming the new Steven Seagal but with bigger budget flicks. Every damn movie he makes he's either special forces, or an undercover super agent, or an ex-special forces/ex- military/ex-super cop or whatever, with super martial arts skills of course. I mean honesty, did the movie really need to take place in exotic locations across the globe? Or was that just the excuse to enable everyone to get a super extravagant holiday that's all paid for, plus you get a wage and you can call it 'work'.5/10",Mechanic - Resurrection
56,phanthinga,a nice 90s action movie tribute,8,23 December 2016,"Mechanic: Resurrection maybe one of the most hated movie in summer 2016 because it came from a movie that nobody want a sequels and probably think it just a cash-in movie for Jason Statham but for me this is one of the best Jason Statham flick beside the The Transporter series which i enjoy a lot.If you go and see this movie do not expect a good plot and good character development.This is a 90s action movie in the core with unlimited ammo,beautiful girl,over the top action scenes and enough action one liners to make you cringe.The movie opening with Jason beat the hell out of a bunch of guys then jumping from a Ski Lift and landing perfectly on a glider if that not awesome i don't know what is it.The minus for me is i wish their could use Michelle Yeoh and Tommy Lee Jones more than just a side character and turned Jessica Alba character into actually Jason wife to make the whole kidnapping and revenging make more sense because the romance in this movie is just too blank that i'm not feeling enough to care for the character.Over all it a fun popcorn flick to invite friend to watch when you have a party",Mechanic - Resurrection
57,jon.h.ochiai,Jason Statham Delivers,6,1 September 2016,"Jason Statham is much better than ""Mechanic: Resurrection"". Statham returns as retired master assassin Arthur Bishop, who is forced back into the game. In the opening 10 minutes of the movie set in spectacular Rio de Janeiro, Statham dispatches 6 skilled killers using mixtures of muay thai, jujitsu, aikido, boxing and more. He executes his powerful kicks, punches, and locks with grace, fury, and immaculate precision. Yes, this has the spectacle of an Olympic event— apparently timing is everything. Unfortunately, the screenplay by Phillip Shelby and Tony Mosher is absolutely silly, and displays little of those Statham fighting qualities. The written material is feeble; going for complicated instead of simple is a critical mistake. Statham is the best martial artist in movies, and a commanding actor. Director Dennis Gansel squanders the opportunity to leverage Statham in a compelling fashion. Gansel does provide breathtaking scenic views of Thailand, Rio, and Australia. Really that is all just pretty window dressing for an inept story. ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" also virtually wastes Michelle Yeoh, who is a great martial artist as well, and a charismatic actress. She plays Bishop's former lover Mei. You have Statham and Yeoh in the same movie, and don't capitalize on this? Jessica Alba as Gina is the contrived love interest in peril. She is beautiful, but is handcuffed by the ridiculous script. She is not strong enough of an actress to overcome these odds. Tommy Lee Jones as flamboyant arms dealer Max Adams is the exciting foil for Statham. Admittedly, I had read the movie reviews, and expected a stupid story. So I watched the movie to see Statham kick some ass. That fulfilled expectations. However, sometimes the movie itself distracted from the electrifying Statham fight scenes. Also Statham's nemesis Crain played by Sam Hazeldine, is not a formidable force for Statham. I enjoyed the movie, and it could have been a lot better. Jason Statham also deserves a lot better.",Mechanic - Resurrection

One according to IMDb cost an estimated $120M to make.. the other a paltry $40M. And watching both there is absolutely no doubt which is which. Spending so much just to produce films is sad commentary on our commercialized world. And it doesn't mean they're ever going to stop making them... but as long as they are, you'd hope they would be worth watching. Well IMHO, one is very much so, and the other is just formula-boring. Liking all the actors has little to do with the production's overall appeal, and they all do decent work in both films. But the story-line has to get the audience involved and on the edge of their seats. Watch them both.. you'll probably see the same... or maybe not.",Mechanic - Resurrection

60,bankofmarquis,Pretty much what you would expect,6,28 August 2016,"When one goes to see a Jason Statham action film like THE MECHANIC or THE TRANSPORTER, one does not expect an Academy Award winning character study with intricate plotting. One expects that you will see Jason killing bad guys in the vein of 80's Arnold and Stallone films - films that have been called ""body count movies"".So, when Statham decided to return to his roots and reprise his role in MECHANIC: RESURRECTION, I had my expectations on the right plane.And, this movie met these expectations, for the most part.The plot is simple, Staham's assassin, THE MECHANIC, is forcefully brought out of retirement to assassinate rivals of an arms dealer. These 3 targets are played by two guys I've never seen before and Tommy Lee Jones. Guess which one of the three gets the bigger, juicier part?The plotting, even for this type of movie, is paper thin and the dialogue and character development almost non-existent, which is fine with me, for I wasn't expecting anything good here.So, how was the action? Were the killings interesting/original?Not really. Besides a death involving a hot tub and a hand grenade, there was no real ingenuity in any of the killings and it looked like Statham, as game as he tried, was going through the motions. Early on, he is aided by veterans Michelle Yeoh and Jessica Alba, but that didn't provide any spark to this film. Only when Tommy Lee Jones showed up did this film have any kind of spark - Jones looked like he was having fun playing a character far removed from anything he's played in a long, long time.In the end, this film is entertaining enough, certainly a good Saturday afternoon popcorn flick. Go for Statham doing what Statham does best, stay for Tommy Lee Jones' antics.6 (out 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Mechanic - Resurrection

Jessica Alba's character was painful to watch. A school teacher with martial arts skills out of the blue like that? I don't think so. Tommy Lee Jones could've played his role in his sleep. As a matter of fact, he WAS asleep since he was shown in his pajamas. Skip this turkey and look for action elsewhere.",Mechanic - Resurrection

They had known each other for a couple of days at best.The action scenes I really enjoyed, some good camera work and it was just fun to watch. That's what this film is isn't it? Just an hour and a half of action, I don't expect an overly interesting story (although I thought the plot was more than fine) that makes you think too much.
It's a typical Statham film, an almost brainless action flick. But that's what I enjoy and I need films like this.Ps Alba just wasn't it this film. Thought her performance wasn't fantastic won't lie. But after the first 20 mins or so she is barely in it.",Mechanic - Resurrection

Now he is forced to travel the globe to complete three impossible assassinations, and do what he does best, make them look like accidents. so basically they were tracking him down, villain Crain (Sam Hazeldine) wanted him to do mission or else they will kill Gina. so they wanted 3 people to be dead so they found right guy to do it, it's not anything like Mission Impossible style it's more of him planning things before he guys into possible mission, not's like mission Impossible. the action scenes are very enjoyable specially the prison breakout scene, glass Swimming pool foot story high building break's a glass crack's, breaks guy falls down that was great scene then first movie in swimming pool scene that's opening but that's not opening for that scene in film, and boat scene was really good a lot of shooting, fighting, explosions i love that but in my opinion i didn't like villain in movie Crain (Sam Hazeldine)i thought he was lame actor, lame villain not weak but he doesn't do anything in film that much i didn't really care about villain. (Tommy Lee Jones)Max Adams who is an arms dealer in Bulgaria Adams and Bishop decide to work together against Crain. doesn't appear in film until 50 minutes he doesn't do much in film since he is not in it as much like Jason Bourne or any film he is just a cameo role in movie. last 50 minutes of action later on Crain wanted Arthur dead so that's why he didn't kill No Point of Killing Max because anyway Crain is going to kill Arthur witch he will do anyway so that's why Arthur and Max going against so thank god they didn't waste Tommy Lee Jones character. i love set up twist at end of film like first one but it's tricky ending but you will understand what i am trying make you guys understand twist ending plus he kill a lot of guys in movie more then first film witch there is some of amazing action scenes body count a lot. cast is pretty good the ones i care about more. i loved Jason Statham always Expendables,Transporter, Crank, Safe much more,Jessica Alba my last movie i loved Sin City Dame to kill for i have no problems with Jessica Alba as actress still hot and sexy on her 30's still good i also liked into blue witch is some little bit of scenes of movie is Into blue but similar , Michelle Yeoh i don't know there's not much to say because she didn't do anything in movie not really part of it but her character was likable. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't appear until 40 minutes of movie until end so he is in it for 30 or i should write more minutes in movie. but he was good in film, you will enjoy movie if you love Jason Statham or first movie Mechanic this is highly recommend for action fans i know script is little bit silly but it's not a Oscar academy Award winner. this is action fans only highly recommend it",Mechanic - Resurrection

70,rooee,In need of a full service,3,27 August 2016,"""Mechanic"" is quite an unsexy title. It conjures images of low-slung jeans, exorbitant MOTs, and overbearing pop radio bellowing out of a sidestreet garage. But it also means ""hit-man"" in mafia language, and Jason Statham's Arthur Bishop is the best of the best. The 2011 film was a pretty mediocre remake of a Michael Winner/Chuck Bronson vehicle (get it?). To say that this sequel – whose belated nature is right there in the title – is an ""original"" work would be pushing it. Bishop is trying to lead a regular type life on his bomb-rigged yacht when he's dragged into a plot devised by Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine), an old orphan buddy. They were separated back in hit-man training school – Bishop got out but Crain turned into a cold- hearted empire-builder. Now Crain wants Bishop to murder his business competitors.Crain needs leverage, so he kidnaps Bishop's girlfriend, Gina (Jessica Alba) – she'll die unless Bishop completes three contracts. The film almost finds its stride during this trio of setpieces; and indeed the plot on paper is silly and simple enough to be a serviceable carriage for Statham's very specific talents. Naturally the trail of destruction leads Bishop to an explosive showdown with Crain himself. The problem is that Mechanic: Resurrection just isn't a very well written, directed, or edited film. Those are all the fundamental phases of film production without a lick of real quality, and the result is there on the screen, from the cheap opening with its poor superimposing, through its arbitrarily globe-hopping narrative, all the way to its bungled non-event of a final revelation. There's no real characterisation to speak of (explaining convoluted plot elements to each other doesn't count) and the whole enterprise is scuppered by the complete lack of chemistry between Statham and Alba. By the way, she's a rote damsel with an angelic tendency for rescuing foreign kids and a penchant for kicking henchmen in the balls. The action is too slow coming, and messily edited when it does arrive. Retrograde in all departments, I couldn't help thinking of Goldeneye N64 as The Stath stalked guards on the bad guy's boat. (Weirdly, we get two of these sequences and they're virtually identical.) Speaking of video games, the other touchstone is surely the Hit-man franchise. As Bishop goes about his business, never under any real threat, it's like watching a speedrun on YouTube.The violence is of the toned-down, CG blood style that has crept into this increasingly PG-13 action culture. Yet we still get a laughably coy sex scene where the stars do it in clothes. It's not like director Dennis Gansel is shy – Statham's body is the temple that his camera worships here, far more than Alba's. The first movie had Donald Sutherland to bring gravitas, and here Tommy Lee Jones is thrown into the mix – albeit very late on and briefly. Laid-back and sporting shades, as though his baddie from Under Siege is all grown up. It's a dead easy pay cheque for Jones but we get precious little of his time. Obviously there are no grey areas here with regard to goodies and baddies. We're not looking for that. But some kind of inventiveness or a narrative curveball wouldn't have gone amiss. Because it's not like we have blistering action to fall back on. There's a scene where Bishop is climbing a skyscraper using sucker pads, and it's so poorly staged and phony; it had me yearning for Ghost Protocol and a proper bit of high-rise stunt work. Resurrection is for Statham completists only. It's worse than its not-great predecessor. A guilty non-pleasure – think Cobra rather than Commando – whose rightful place is the small screen, and last on the watchlist.",Mechanic - Resurrection

72,coreyjdenford,Revenge is sweet,6,25 August 2016,"This is my review of Mechanic: Resurrection (spoiler free)*** (3/5)Cast: Jason Statham, Jessica Alba, Tommy Lee-Jones, Michelle YeohPlot: Arthur Bishop (Statham) thought he had put his murderous past behind him when his most formidable foe kidnaps the love of his life (Alba). Now he is forced to travel the globe to complete three impossible assassinations, and do what he does best, make them look like accidents.A lot of people say that whenever Statham is in a new movie the only person he can play is himself, but maybe that isn't so much a bad thing. The world's most athletic assassin is back with more action and more heart stopping stunts than ever okay not than ever because there has only been one Mechanic. The first Mechanic (2011) saw Bishop kill quite a few people so you may be thinking what's the difference between the movies? Well this has been done on a much larger scale especially when in one scene you see him dangling from the bottom of transparent pool almost fifty stories up a building, to kill one unfortunate McGuffin. This is technically called Mechanic 2 but the only reason why it is called Resurrection is because Bishop has been resurrected from the dead. This sounds very familiar to another movie done before this well there is, Crank (2006) which saw Chev (also Statham) fall from a helicopter 14,000 feet in the air and then he comes back for revenge in Crank: High Voltage (2009). But don't blame Statham for wanting to do a sequel of the Mechanic because that ended on such a cliff-hanger. This is a pretty good continuation from the first film he goes out in search of revenge and he does it with such grace and formality, well the grace being death defying jumps and the formality being they look like accidents. This shows to be a fit for Statham though especially considering it's the first time working with German director Dennis Gansel, but again it's done well or moderately well. Unfortunately the script is a bit wobbly in some places and the other actors don't have a sense of tone in voice but sometimes if the action is good and fast-paced you don't have to worry about the scripting, unless in Gods of Egypt's (2016) case when it doesn't have a plot. But because of the wobbly scripting it turns out that the performances aren't particularly great either, although Statham tries to the best of his abilities but the real performer is the action, the stunts and the bullets, also the story is a little bit flat it does take a while for the action to get started, although in some areas it starts pretty much immediately but it takes a while for him to get the assassinations sorted, and finally when it gets to them they are too quick to end not necessarily a bad thing. Of course just like in the first one Bishop is very clever especially when he uses surveillance to scope out the people he wants to kill, but that's another story he is clever in the way he devises his plans to end people's lives mainly his enemies, and also the use of explosives which is the key element to this movie but then that is the key element to action movies, well some actioners. There is a way this film is done better this is kind of like the first one as well everywhere Bishop goes it is absolutely stunning with the gorgeous landscapes and the beautiful women, but he doesn't go there for women, he's not James Bond. Sometimes whenever Bishop plans his kills it doesn't always go well like last time when one of his targets killed him, but ignore that. There are several Heart stopping stunts in this blood filled actioner, the main stunt let's call it a jump happens very early on when he is in Rio de Janeiro and he jumps straight down from a cargo lift to a hand glider in the air, that stunt will literally stop your heart but not everything in this movie is stunts there is also quite a unique story to it a bit flat but it's there. Character development as this the second in the series we already know what there is about Arthur Bishop, but what about the other characters? Do we learn about them? Well not really, not much anyway there is a little bit to learn about the characters especially one of the targets, which strangely enough Tommy Lee-Jones' Max Adams in his most ridiculous outfit yet, but also he doesn't say much which again is weird because in most of his movies he's quite the talker.Now finally the one thing that is missing for all you Statham fans there is no martial arts, whenever Statham stars in a new film there is loads of martial arts spectacles to behold but unfortunately that is the one thing that is missing but don't let that disappoint you there is still plenty of blood filled, guns blazing action to peel your eyes at. So don't get too upset about the martial arts being missing. In conclusion this is an enjoyable action packed ride with plenty of blood guns and beautiful women, and even Statham's gruff demeanor is something to enjoy weirdly enough. Even though Statham has done some disastrous disappointments this surely isn't one. Certainly not as manic as the Crank series but still fun and enjoyable and probably one of the best ever Statham actioners.Verdict: Statham delivers to the best of his abilities in this long-awaited sequel which feels very familiar but it's an enjoyable actioner nonetheless.6/10 action packed gold.",Mechanic - Resurrection
73,jackmeat,"Well, it is a sequel",6,22 October 2016,"My quick rating 5,8/10. Bishop (Jason Statham) is back, retired, but back. This film uses the fairly tired yet usually effective, ""retired, but drawn back in"" storyline. Being a highly sought after assassin tends to lead to some problems for Bishop. As expected, a bad guy comes calling (Sam Hazeldine) and has a job for him. The delivery of the message comes by way of Jessica Alba, which is always a treat. Of course, there is your fall in love, obligatory romance that needs to be thrown in. Well, the job is simple: Kill 3 targets that happen to be guarded in very difficult places. This leads us to insanely elaborate action sequences that tip the scale of reality plenty. But that is why we watch, not for the sensibility of it. The locations used, and film work to add to the visuals is stunning. That is for sure. I am sure you can guess this entire movie before even seeing it, so I won't bother any further explaining. Flix such as this are meant for watching in awe and disbelief. Escapism if you will of all the things you can't do, and places you will not visit (yes, I have been to Sydney, but I doubt I am going to see a pool hanging out from a skyscraper 57 stories high). It is nothing new but polished action that delivers exactly what it was supposed to. Sprinkle in a very strange looking Tommy Lee Jones with a small yet effective role as well as Michelle Yeoh (criminally underused) to wrap it up, and you have a solid action film that doesn't rewrite the genre but just gives you a good 1.5 hours of action and scenery.",Mechanic - Resurrection

75,Jerghal,As cliché as action movies get,6,12 November 2016,"Jason Statham has a monopoly on the action movie market because he seems to be in every single one of them and seems to play the same character every time. The film is not really a sequel to the mechanic remake in which he also played so there is no need to having seen that one - it works stand alone. Mechanic Resurrection is as about cliché as action movies get: a bad guy kidnaps Statham's girlfriend so he has to do some assassinations in interesting ways on far away locations. The plot is full of holes (you really have to stop thinking if things in this movie would work or be possible in real life or you'll get really annoyed by this flick) and the dialogue is cookie cutter stuff. The film was made on a shoestring budget and shot mostly in Bulgaria with the 1134 VFX shots also done by a Bulgarian company...and you can tell coz when for example a boat blows up they just composited the explosion and flames onto it, the boat doesn't move an inch and there is no debris flying around. A lot of scenes where shot on a blue-screen stage and you can easily tell which ones coz they have this overly bright 'studio lighting' look. The fight scenes are descent but like I said nothing you haven't seen before in another Statham film. So conclusion: you won't see anything you haven't seen before here and the film is mediocre at best. You won't be bored but this is definitely NOT a must see by any stretch of the imagination.",Mechanic - Resurrection

The Resurrection is a very (very!) bad movie, with a concept more appropriate to Steven Seagal or Van Damme or even Bruce Willis. Except for the main character and some good performances by the cast, this one has nothing to do with the original Mechanic. I think that the idea behind the first movie deserves much much better approach to a sequel (if any). This is, to put it simple, cheap. Corny. Cheesy. Stupid.

79,BigGuy,"Some good action, some bad action and a simple plot",5,25 August 2016,"Mechanic: Resurrection at times felt like watching someone play a computer game. Unlike the predecessor, the plot in this movie was very bland and lacking in nuance. It was like a series of gates, break into place 1 and defeat boss 1. Break into place 2, defeat boss 2. Obtain clues, break in and defeat boss, repeat.The other reason the movie felt like a computer game was that the CGI was a bit too obvious in a lot of scenes. Fire that spreads perfectly and regularly. Every bullet that hits someone creates a minor fountain of blood (that doesn't seem to hit the ground or soak into their clothes).The movie did start off with what could have been a great action scene, but ended up being so-so. The reason it was only so-so was because it was impossible to see what was going on. Too much jerky camera work and jump cuts made it hard to see. Statham has the chops to do action scenes without making the scene more frenetic with cheap cinematography.One comment I overheard leaving the theater was why cast Jessica Alba. I won't say she did a bad job, but she wasn't particularly compelling either and had little chemistry with Statham, which undermined the motivation for the whole movie. I would also comment that I was very sad that Michelle Yeoh didn't get a more substantive role.Overall, it was a bit disappointing. There was some good action, although it was usually undermined by the camera work. There were a few minutes of wittiness, but overall it's a summer action movie that will be forgotten.",Mechanic - Resurrection

81,SpoilerAlertReviews,Distorted Arthur Bishop. just a Statham movie,3,1 September 2016,"German film maker Dennis Gansel takes over from Simon West (Con Air, Expendables 2) filming the sequel to a remake, The Mechanic. Jason Statham returns as Arthur Bishop with that awful husky voice. Yes, it's a London accent and not the pretend American one, but it grates on me. What makes it worse is that the bad guy pulling the strings (Sam Hazeldine) is also an East End orphan with the same husky voice which actually gives the film an English dubbed feel. It's a step backwards story wise as the original plot was actually quite good. Just lacking some John Woo emotional turmoil as the basis of the first was very much the relationship battlefield. This one just becomes a mess, like the studios were just looking for any reason to bring Bishop out of hiding. It doesn't make sense character wise, but I could be wrong. I thought Bishop, especially the Bronson original was a cold-hearted assassin, a loner and would kill his own friend, which they both did. So, Statham falling in love with Alba whilst knowing it's just a ploy to get him to knock off a few major arms dealers just doesn't make any sense. I think the studios must have listened to Statham fans, like myself, with regards to fight scenes. As this is certainly was an improvement on the first, knowing Statham's martial arts capabilities. The film opens well with a good choreographed punch-up and whilst going a little classic James Bond cheesy I was hoping the film was going to carry on like it. But no, instead, Bishop goes agent 47 with MacGyver style precision. The final fight wasn't so bad but everything else in the middle was just mediocre. It's bad acting all round, Jessica Alba was not convincing at all, and though she flaunts off her body, it's the usual Alba we all know. I have no idea what Malaysian super-star Michelle Yeoh was doing there, though, not actually a trained martial artist she is incredibly talented, yet she did little else apart from provide a story anchor. I'm use to seeing Tommy Lee Jones pop up for these smaller, out of character roles, but surely it would have made more sense to sack both Jones and Yeoh, getting smaller stars for the smaller roles and get a badder bad guy. Hell, Jones could have done it! I think where it attempted to be clever just made it dumber, unrealistic and clichéd. It was borderline spoof comedy with the amount of passports, safe houses and secret caches Bishop had. I was actually hoping for a double cross like the first but no, just Bishop being sneaky again. Even from the poster, I just see Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell. I'm a Statham fan and I tried my best to not take this too seriously, but unfortunately I don't think anyone behind the movie took it seriously either which is a shame as the Bishop character, like The Jackal, is a great character.Running Time: 5 The Cast: 4 Performance: 4 Direction: 5 Story: 2 Script: 2 Creativity: 4 Soundtrack: 3 Job Description: 1 The Extra Bonus Point: 030% 3/10",Mechanic - Resurrection

Some plot holes when he planned the assassinations of the 3 men. The blueprints, the bombs, the escape equipment and the perfect timing of everything. He must have shot and killed over 100 men! AND the guys he shot were terrible guards, bodyguards, elite fighters as portrayed in this film. They couldn't fight, couldn't 'hit the side of barn' and even Jessica got the better of a couple of them. Also no chemistry between them, an unlikely pairing of of these 'high-paid' actors. I will not recommend this to anyone. The others I liked were HOMEFRONT, CELLULAR, TRANSPORTER(1), and a film he did with JLo.",Mechanic - Resurrection
83,rutzelb,It Was Okay,5,1 December 2016,"Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a retired assassin who faked his own death to get away from all that madness is contacted to kill 3- people, but must make it look like an accident. Bad guy Crain (Sam Hazeldine) will kill Gina (Jessica Allba) if Bishop is not successful. No doubt the CGI and fighting stunts are spectacular, but here's the thing: remember the Mission Impossible TV series where we saw many, many minutes taken up to put everything together to get the scene exactly the way that was needed? In many ways we had no idea what they were doing until the actual scene to fool the bad guy was ready to go. Well, almost the same thing here. Bishop does a lot of this kind of thing (Call it busy work) and this took up a lot of time, and did we care? Of course not. We just wanted to see how he does his job when he actually does it. We can assume that a lot of planning went into the stunt. We really didn't need to see all these nebulous details. Why make the movie longer than it has to be?It was the length of the movie that caused all the above to be looked into. Why was it so long? Well, now we know. Of course the romantic dalliance between Bishop and Gina went absolutely nowhere. The chemistry just wasn't there. Again precious minutes were wasted on something no one cared about. Don't get me wrong, Jessica Alba as Gina is really good eye-candy and we don't mind that, but the chemistry was a no go. Now late into the movie we see Tommy Lee Jones (I didn't know he was in this until I saw someone who almost looked like him) as Max Adams, who is supposed to be the 3rd kill. Well, he was a breath of fresh air and wished he had more screen time. But here's the thing. We didn't see Bishop make the preparations for this 3rd kill, they were already in place as the Director saw that he was running out of time. See, it can be done.To be fair Jason Statham is a very good actor and deserves more credit than he is given for these Action-Hero movies Jessica Alba is just now returning to the movies and we are glad of it. Yes, even if she just stands there we are okay with that. And Tommy Lee Jones is always a breath of fresh air.But, here's the thing: we see Jason Statham's name and we just know we will see fantastic fighting choreography and spectacular CGI and we are not disappointed as it was okay, but the wasteful preparations to make the kills and a no-go chemistry between Bishop and Gina bring all this down.

He's still one of my favorite actors but some of the films he's been playing in really weren't my type of hype, this one especially. This sequel to the original film ""Mechanic"", which was actually pretty good, shouldn't have ever been a resurrection. Where should I start?! The story- line was too simple, the plot was too weak and there should have been more riveting action scenes to keep the viewer interested. If this film was written and directed by someone else with action movie expertise this probably would have been a more decent film. The acting alone was O.K. Like I said previously, Jason Stathom is one of my favorite actors but he could have done better than this and I'm surprised that Tommy Lee Jones would have even looked at this script! The type of actor Tommy Lee Jones is I wouldn't have imagined in a million years that he would star in something like this and as for Jessica Alba, I do enjoy seeing her in films but when the film is only worth watching just because Jessica Alba is in it I wouldn't recommend it except for that reason.

90,urthpainter,"Because it has Statham, Alba & Michelle Yeoh",7,13 January 2017,"Judged on any measure of film acumen, Mechanic: Resurrection may garner a 3 or 4 stars out of 10. But because it has Statham*, Alba* & Michelle Yeo*? Thats three more stars + another star because it has Statham, Alba & Michell Yeoh. Just wanted to clarify my rating.In the vein of the Ringo Lam masterpiece the one with JCVD and the hot blond actress where he has a twin, but NOT Double Impact damn  MAXIMUM RISK!!! (always forget that one's name) While nowhere near as good as Maximum Risk, Mechanic: Resurrection has that same kind of feel. Excellent action scenes strung together with a love interest who is involved with the wrong people. Where as Maximum Risk maintains a consistent style and pace throughout every scene, Mechanic:Resurrection is comically bad in terms of writing, acting - really anything involving the story. Luckily the action scenes do sparkle, and have a really fun brutality. The action also escalates from the beginning to the last scene, which is nice - many half assed action movies place the best action scenes early or in the middle, when they really should follow this model of growing intensity throughout the movie.What should not be followed is the script written by someone who played a whole lot of Metal Gear Solid, Hit-man, or any of a number of stealth/tactical espionage video games. There is a really artificial feel to a great deal of this movie, and while I fully recommend video games borrow content from movies I'm not so sure going the other way around is such a good idea. I'm sure many people would find this movie unwatchable, but not meBecause it has Statham, Alba & Michelle Yeoh.It also has Tommy Lee Jones, but I won't hold that against the movie - 7 out of 10",Mechanic - Resurrection

95,yourfavoritecritic,Someone Should Have Called the Mechanic to Resurrect this Film,2,29 December 2020,"Mechanic: Resurrection, sees the return of Jason Statham as the badass Arthur Bishop, who after the events of the first film, fled to South America to live a seemingly normal life. However, thanks to an old friend, the ex-hitman is forced out of retirement and contracted to carry out three assassinations. Alongside Jessica Alba and Tommy Lee Jones, the stakes have never been higher for Statham's character, or that's what the film wants you to believe anyways.Directed by Dennis Gansel, Mechanic: Resurrection, released in the summer of 2016, five years after the release of the first film. This time around, the film shed its gritty nature of the predecessor in favour of a broader colour pallet, more action and even goofier dialogue. However all that culminates into what seems like a very cheap, poorly made film. The first act to this movie is absolutely dreadful, it is so ridiculously slow to the point where you feel bored to tears, and the action in the opening sequence is laughingly bad. The CGI and green screen work was absolutely abhorrent, that would make you think you were watching some movie made for under a million dollars. The way the action is presented during this sequence is so weirdly directed that it was difficult to comprehend how bad the film was. It features these shaky-cam moments with the subjects clearly in focus and just the background is unstable. It's super disorientating and left a bad taste in my mouth.It doesn't help that the film screeches to a halt for 20 minutes, as the filmmakers force a relationship between Statham and Alba, as to set up the plot for the rest of the film. Luckily the film does get a bit better in its final two acts. The plot is very videogame-esque, with Bishop tasked with completing three separate assassinations, that appear to be near impossible. The big baddie is someone that blackmails Bishop into completing these tasks and does not have his best intentions in mind, and taking him out also seems unlikely due to his influence. All this just seems like a plot to a Ubisoft game or something, and the action that follows also feels like it would be cool to play. Although it is quite goofy, I did enjoy the mindless action, I found the the three targeted missions to be dumb but also a little fun.Despite the change of pace, Mechanic: Resurrection cannot escape its brutal opening and poorly executed presentation, with so many fade-to-black moments making the entire film feel so choppy with pointless scenes. The acting isn't also something to write home to about, it's serviceable given the goofy dialogue and plot, which I must add is incredibly questionable. There is a sequence in the film wherein after Bishop completes one of his assignments returns to try and take out the guy that's giving him orders, however all this just leads to nowhere outside of a 7 minute action scene. It just feels relatively pointless outside of establishing that the antagonist is well fortified and that it will take Arthur a lot of effort to kill him. Much of this movie is littered with moments like that, where Bishop makes questionable decisions that sort of oppose the characterization that he is a ""smart"" guy.Mechanic: Resurrection, is bad. Sadly it's not bad enough to categorize as a ""so bad its good film"". There were sequences that I enjoyed but there were also moments that were particularly difficult to get through, most notably the first act, which was so obscenely bad that I was preparing myself for the worst. Although the film does pull itself out from the putridness of its opening 30 minutes, its still not enough to save the film as it is very poorly made and for that reason I am giving Mechanic: Resurrection a 2/10",Mechanic - Resurrection
96,northernpaladin,Dismal,3,25 July 2019,"I watched this one night on TV just because it happened to be on - I had seen the first one. I'm not part of the Jason Statham fan club but equally they can be quite entertaining, this however is not.
The basic plot is simply ludicrous; ultra assassin (Statham) is coerced into killing bad guys for another bad guy to save the life of a girl (Alba) he's known barely 48 hours. Each kill is 'impossible' but Statham achieves it with ridiculous ease and the body count of goons just becomes a blur after a while - helped immensely by a silenced pistol that never runs out of bullets!
In the final showdown doing the obvious - kill the girl! seems to elude the bad guy and a sadistic death awaits him. Hero & Heroine reunited.
This was clearly done solely for the money and I'm sure Jason Statham did very nicely out of it while Alba, Yeoh and Jones are utterly wasted although I guess their pay check was pretty good.

Essentially he goes from one killing to the next in fairly rapid succession.The scenery is nice with locations in Rio, Sydney and South East Asia. Jessica Alba's character is not really at all relevant and is a hard sell that this is the reason he is bullied into doing the killings. The romantic connection between the two is nil.

100,ActionFan-Reviews,Statham Shooting & Beating People Up Again? Count Me In !,6,22 August 2016,"With a movie like Mechanic: Resurrection, you won't expect Oscar worthy acting or dialogue and it certainly isn't going to reinvent the action genre or an established formula.This unexpected sequel, is another decent entry into Stathams filmography and further cements him as one of the top action stars of this generation. Plenty of bad guys get wasted in a number of ways by Statham, which is always entertaining. So for fans looking for there action fix, don't look far as this movie racks up a healthy body count. Although the film met expectations, I felt the overuse of CGI in some action sequences instead of more practical, stunt driven action brought it down a notch. I also felt the original 2011 remake was a more lean, fast paced action movie that managed to pack more solid R-rated action. Ben Fosters performance and his chemistry with Statham added more to the film and story whereas the sequel may have a great cast on paper, the supporting roles and characters they play are either forgettable or little used. Overall, if you want some Statham fueled action, you can't go wrong with this movie on a Tuesday show or a lazy night in.

101,infoalwaysacritic,Run of the Mill with a couple of moments to shine,4,18 April 2017,"The premise isn't bad, even if it has been done before. A retired hit-man is coerced into returning to the job in order to save a special someone from an enemy from his past. The result is plenty of hard-hitting fist fights, gun battles and some interesting creative deaths. This is of course because the main character is supposed to make each death look like an accident.What this film does right is primarily in the choreographed fights. Hard knocks and some quick use of his fists, Jason Statham's physicality, already exhibited in many of his other films, is put to near constant use. The rest of the movie, however, is pretty rough around the edges.The story falls apart on several points as character's only motivation to behave as they do is to morbidly push the plot along, which is especially frustrating when deaths that are supposed to look like accidents are clearly murders. The motivations of characters are foggy at best, especially the impetuous relationship between Jason Statham and Jessica Alba's characters.In addition to the poorly conceived plot line, the effects department and production team failed to blend green screen stages, background sets and simple explosions in a convincing manner.Have a watch if you're looking for a quick action film with lots of people getting shot, large amounts of time dedicated to fruitless attacks that result in getting characters nowhere they want to be and lots of Jason Statham without his shirt on, punching people in the face.",Mechanic - Resurrection
102,pendenquejohn,Correct but seriously not the best...,4,28 December 2016,"My gut sentiment after this movie was that it was a decent action movie but not the one I would have expended a lot of money on. The landscapes are quite amazing in general and the action scenes are very interesting. I would not call them the best but they do make sense -; with a mix of Hit-man and secret agent. There was a variety of ways with which Statham dealt with some situations that made them quite surprising though as always you kind of knew who was going to be winner resulting from all of this.I'm not completely aware of Statham's acting since I kind of avoid his movies, and, Jessica Alba, seems like an eternity since I've last seen her in a movie. I think they were average and I'm pretty sure, anyways in Jessica's perspective, that she could do much better. Her talent is there, she can convey such a wide variety of emotions and faces in comparison to certain young overrated actors that she's always a solid deal for almost any kind of movie.The plot was obviously really simple and you could kind of see where this was going from the start. I don't really think it affected the movie that much since there was a good dynamic, and, these actors being experienced ones, it did not completely fall flat unto its face as some average movies do usually do because of atrocious acting.In conclusion, this is the type of movie where quite frankly you do not really know what to write. It could have probably been better but it's not that bad per se in comparison to others on the market. So there's this mixed feeling.I really do believe that it's the type of movie you would watch with friends as a quick alternative if you have nothing else available or probably the genre you would watch if you are on a long trip.

I am a huge fan of Jason Statham but he was predictable in this movie because all his movies are basically the same...I do give credit to Jessica Alba though she was probably the only good thing about it to me.

105,ultimatenexus,A hilarious action film with an inept plot.,5,16 August 2018,"If London Has Fallen came out last year instead of this year, Mechanic: Resurrection would be considered the London Has Fallen of 2016. Three months from now, I probably won't remember much of this other than the fact that Statham was in it and a bunch of boats explode, and not just because it's forgettable and incredibly stupid. The story was pretty weak and despite the fact that I just saw this like three hours ago, I've already forgotten the villain's name.Oh yeah, and I guess Jessica Alba was in it.Luckily, the stupidity this film proudly wears on its forehead is one of the many types of stupidity I can thoroughly enjoy if done right, and I can safely say that Mechanic: Resurrection was both pleasingly stupid and probably the most decent a film with 'Resurrection' in the title could possibly be. The reason why I keep mentioning this and London Has Fallen is because both movies pretend to take themselves seriously and feature protagonists that are so humourless that they essentially become the opposite. Just look at those frowns on their faces. They are deadpan comedy acts, scowling their way through over-the-top carnage and jump-edited fight scenes. While Gerard Butler has shown some range in his other films (including a couple other action films), Jason Statham continues to prove that he's only got one act--which I'm sure he's well aware of, given that the Crank films utilized his knack for uber-seriousness to full comedic effect. This act of his is actually one of the reasons why his fans (including me) find him so entertaining to watch. He's like a lowkey Schwarzenegger with a British accent.So when I mentioned that the story was weak, I meant that it involves some dude from Arthur Bishop's past kidnapping his girlfriend and then telling him that he has to do three impossible assassination jobs in a specific number of hours in order to get her back. Oh, and they have to look like accidents.But see, here's my problem with that plan. I don't usually do this, but anyway; if you consider these spoilers, you can skip the next three paragraphs, and I've set the spoiler button on just in case, but since they happen in the first twenty minutes of the movie and set the whole plot into motion, I don't really count them as spoilers, so whatever.Our villain wants Bishop to do these jobs before he even kidnapped his girlfriend, but he refused because he wants to stay ""dead"" after the events of the first movie and then flees to Thailand like every sensible action protagonist does when they need to live a new life under the radar. The villain's solution? 
 He kidnaps Jessica Alba and sends her to the island Bishop is hiding with an ""abusive boyfriend"" whom Bishop kills and saves her from. But if it weren't for a horribly misplaced Michelle Yeoh (seriously, Ms. Yeoh, why would you let them do this to you?) with whom Bishop is also friends with noticing the scuffle on a boat floating a good distance away from the island, Bishop would've never even known about it. And if poor Ms. Yeoh didn't turn his attention to it and give him a quick moral motivation sentence to get him to change his mind about minding his own business, he wouldn't have gotten involved even if he DID know about it. And since our villain knew him since childhood, one would think he would've seen the flaw in the first step of that plan.But it gets even better: the villain not only expects Bishop to save Random Jessica Alba, but he also expects him to fall in love with her in such a short amount of time so that when he eventually sends his goons to kidnap her, he'll be too scared for her life to say no. His entire plain hinges on this cold professional assassin falling in love with a random stranger in the course of two days. He didn't stop to consider that maybe the man he blames for leaving him behind in a war zone so many years ago wouldn't care about what happens to Jessica Alba when he kidnaps her? He didn't think the amount of time he gave Bishop to fall for Jessica Alba might not be enough? What if Bishop didn't care what happened to Jessica Alba? Would he let his goons try to use brute force to persuade him like they failed to do in the opening scene? Why wouldn't he just try this honeypot thing with Jessica Alba first so that he could get Bishop when his guard is relatively down instead of trying it when he's already chased him off to Thailand with his guard raised to maximum? And why Jessica Alba? Was Eva Green too busy?It would make a little more sense if he mentioned that Bishop still has some kind of moral code that would keep him from letting Jessica Alba die, but throughout the whole movie, he goes on about how he would do anything to save Jessica Alba because he's so in love with her or something. He's THAT convinced that part of his plan worked. The rest of the movie's preposterousness at least makes sense compared to this one stupid detail. This plan should've already failed before it even started! The best thing about this is that the villain died believing that his plan actually worked, and never once was corrected by Bishop or anyone else with any shred of common sense.Anyway, the three jobs Bishop has to do are fairly clever in a low rent Jason Bourne/James Bond kind of way. They're probably the few highlights the film actually has, aside from the boat battles and the hilariously stupid glider scene at the beginning of the film. It's a good thing this movie didn't take itself so seriously, or else I might not have had nearly as much fun as I did. The action scenes are entertaining, but not all that engaging, and the music is serviceable at best. Tommy Lee Jones stuck out a bit as an eccentric gun runner with far too little screentime, and despite this being intentionally deadpan-comedic in its presentation (I hope), I feel as though they missed an opportunity to explore some of Bishop's background to make him seem a bit more human and add a more personal connection to the villain whose name I've unregrettably forgotten. Because of the nonexistence of that element, the villain just comes off as a whiner with a big boat and a chip on his shoulder. ""You left me to die"" is about as fleshed-out as his character gets, and that does a service to the film's short runtime, but a disservice to its already shallow, unoriginal plot.Having caught this on closing night, I felt kind of lucky, because I didn't even know that this was showing in my local theatre until I walked by it earlier today and saw ""ENDING THURSDAY"" slapped across its poster.

110,kevin_newdirections,"Should not disappoint Statham fans, but it badly needs a plot overhaul",6,12 September 2016,"Watching this film without having seen the trailer made me ask these following questions: Is this the film where Statham is a no-questions-asked transporter of precarious things? Or maybe this is the crazy Statham film where he needs to constantly keep his adrenaline flowing either by getting into fights or electrocuting himself? How about that Statham movie where he stars along with a bunch of washed-up 90's action stars? As I sit in the theater, deliberating which premise I should hold on to before the movie starts (a film titled Mechanic: Resurrection definitely sounds like a sequel), a realization struck in my mind: Maybe, I keep getting confused which Statham film is which because Jason Statham is a typecast actor who ALMOST plays the SAME character EVERY movie.Of course, there are a few exceptions to this, like last year's Spy, where Statham shows his comedic quips. However, with the excessive amounts of killshots here in Resurrection, he steps back again into being a relentless killing machine. Then again, this film won't fare better without him – he's mostly better than most of the films he's in, no matter how stereotypical his character can be. He may not be have a vast emotional range but his brute finesse along with his cockney accent warrants credibility to the anti-hero roles that he usually play. Still, one actor can only do so much.To answer my question earlier, apparently, this is the Statham movie where he plays Arthur Bishop, an assassin who terminates his targets in a way that it will look like an accident. (Don't bother remembering the first film, this one feels like a stand-alone.) In here, the retired mercenary is blackmailed into killing three elusive criminals by some generic villain named Crain (Sam Hazeldine). If he fails to do so, the bad guys are going to kill his girlfriend, Gina (Jessica Alba), a woman that he basically met several hours ago. The two bonded over a Thai song and next thing, they hook up, they're in love and they're willing to die for each other – that level of cringe-worthiness. Neither does flaunting Statham's and Alba's beach bods help in pleading an appeal to their chemistry. If you don't buy the feeble romance subplot, the rest of the action that follows will have no drive at all.What's shocking is, despite all the globe-trotting this film has to offer (Brazil, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia and Bulgaria), Resurrection still comes out as flat. Director Dennis Gansel clearly tries to outdo bigger tent-pole action films like James Bond, Jason Bourne or Mission Impossible with all the over-the-top action sequences but plot-wise, it won't even match by an inch. Even the direction and cinematography look as uninspired as its screenplay. I enjoyed, however, a showstopper Ghost Protocol-inspired scene where Bishop flushes out a man from a high-rise pool. Apart from that, it will be hard to suspend disbelief in all of the far-fetched tricks. Especially in the film's opening sequence where Bishop smoothly jumps from a cable car to a flying paraglider. As if it's as simple as playing hopscotch.Mechanic: Resurrection should not disappoint Statham fans and I will still put this in my bin of guilty pleasure mindless action films, only to re-watch if I have nothing better to do. If only the film had a flash of ingenuity, this could have turned out different. Otherwise, if you want this to be both high on adrenaline and intellect, send it to a screenplay mechanic for it badly needs a plot overhaul.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/mechanic-resurrection",Mechanic - Resurrection

112,klheintz,Not very good,3,1 November 2016,"I was excited to watch this movie after enjoying the original a few years back and I have to say that I was severely let down. I understand that story is not really a focus in a Statham flick but come on, it's established that he makes his hits look like accidents but all I am seeing is crazy action scenes in very public places with tons of witnesses! So, yeah, the story is definitely weak in this one. What's also weak is the acting ability in majority of the characters. Alba and Statham display the best acting in the film and that's not saying much at all. If you go into the movie only expecting an action movie with basically no story then this isn't a bad option but if you're looking for anything more than some flashy action scenes... look elsewhere.",Mechanic - Resurrection

Direction and editing are definitely something you can't compare with a pro..there are some passage that you can't even find in an amateur wedding tape. I don't want to spoiler a lot let's say that there are different occasion where the camera stay a bit to much and without a reason on Jessica Alba when she's doing the bath,when she's walking, when she's making love ..too much of a nice girl to put some spicy on a movie that is terrible and doesn't have a bit of rhythm during all the editing. Photography it's OK outside but it's poor in front of green back you will notice a lot so are definitely poorly done the visual effects.

He plays practically the same character in every one of his films and the plots (what little there are) are usually interchangeable. That being said, the action is usually good and they films don't outstay their welcome.Which is why I was disappointed with this film. It started so well, with a great action scene to kick things off, then it crashes to an abrupt halt.Whoever was in charge of pacing for this film needs a talking to, as the island scene with Jessica Alba was so long and drawn out that I nearly considered leaving, and this is only a ninety-minute film!After that some stuff happened which advanced the 'plot' (which was weak, as expected). I think they missed opportunities to add some plot twists with Alba's character, as she could have actually been the bad guy (which would have been awesome) and instead went for the expected path.It seems mean to pick holes in the story (it feels like criticising a dyslexic's spelling), but the whole point of getting Statham's character (the Mechanic), to do the kills was to make them look like accidents (presumably so that the other targets didn't realise they were being targeted), but the third target (Tommy Lee Jones' character) immediately knew that Crain (the bad guy) was going after them, kinda rendering using the Mechanic a moot point.Anyway, the action scenes were good, but not enough to raise up this very mediocre film.

I was hoping they put on the new Woody Allen movie or Hell or High Water, which looks very promising. When I saw Jason Statham his name on the screen I realized which movies I was going to watch.The trailers didn't interest me at all, so I was skeptical prior to watching this flick. This is one of the most generic films I have seen in a long time. There are many problems and just a few things that are actually ""good"" about this.Characters: As many filmmakers know, characters are key for moving the plot. The only person who moves this plot is the antagonist, who's name I have already forgotten. Jason Statham and Jessica Alba are not very good leads in this. They have done some promising things in the past, Statham did great in Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Jessica Alba was pretty good in that time she appeared in The Office and she was promising in Dark Angel, which I gave up on quite quickly. The actors are not the ones to blame though, the writers and the director are. Character development is barely in this movie and none of the characters except for Tommy Lee Jones are interesting or intriguing in any way. Now I know there are people out there who think characters do not matter in an action flick like this, but I think it does. Go ahead and look up an action scene from a summer movie that you haven't seen yet. Pretty unexciting right? That's because you don't know and don't care about the interaction of the characters in that scene, and that was one of the biggest problems in this entire movie. Everyone is bland and forgettable. Plot: It's like I was watching Killer Elite, from 2011. The story is exactly the same with the same lead actor: -A hit-man who makes his kills look like accidents stars in both movies -A loved one is captured -The antagonist tells the protagonist to kill three targets and the loved one will liveThat's how generic this is: it's been done exactly the same years ago. Action: Action gets bland and boring quick. It's uncreative and uninspiring, there is nothing original, cool or crazy about it. There is not much to say about it, except that you can find this action in any summer action movie.Now why did I rate it three stars instead of one? Well, the skyscraper scene was entertaining for a minute and Tommy Lee Jones's character was the best character in this film, every time he was on screen the film felt much better. And that's not because Tommy Lee Jones is a good actor, it's because this character had a personality unlike the rest of the cast.Don't waste your money as this is another pathetic attempt of Hollywood trying to earn a few more dollars. Go watch Killer Elite if the plot sounds interesting or if you want to go to the cinema go watch something that isn't this. I'll do you a favor.",Mechanic - Resurrection

The reason that i wanna see this sequel is the cast. Is not just Statham alone but along with Tommy Lee Jones (Academy Award winner), Jessica Alba and international martial actress from Malaysia - Michelle Yeoh. The story begins with Bishop that begin to enjoy his retirement - tired and sick of all the murderers he planned but then a beautiful Thai girl approached him and offering 3 jobs or get killed. but off course Bishop easily handled this girl and the thugs she bring along with her through a brutal hand combat and escape.Then Bishop move far away to Thailand and warmly welcomed by his old friend - Mei (Michelle Yeoh).Then soon Bishop reluctantly have to save an attractive girl - Gina (Jessica Alba) whom being beaten by a guy named Frank - just to find out that all was just a set up to spying on him. But, Bishop got another plan, since he already know who behind all this, he intend to finish this once and for all. Then Bishop meet Crain, a man who hold his grudge upon Bishop for so long - but want Bishop to do 3 hard tasks - murder high profiles villains - but with his expertise - the killing must look like accident.Bishop easily finished his 2 first tasks - but then he realized that Crain got something behind this all schemes. So,he decide to collaborate with the 3rd target - Max Adams (Tommy Lee Jones), the most powerful gun dealers in all Europea Continent.Again, that this sequel still far from my expectation. I was hope that this sequel will bring more escalation on every aspect, the characters, the conflicts, character development. But, turn out to be only 2 element added to this sequel 1)Bishop's love story and 2)action package.I do really like some ""humour"" elements inserted but still not enough to make me Laugh Out Loud. Also i was really keen when Bishop finally find out that Gina reluctantly ""working"" for Crain, but then just so easily Bishop finally fall in love with Gina. A person like Bishop. I really enjoy when Bishop create the accident to kill Cook. And that was really original idea (at least from where i belong). But the funny thing is : the terms of the assignment was the killing must 100% look like accident or Crain will kill Gina. The 1st task was done not really look like accident. The other thing, i always enjoy Tommy Lee Jones perform as Max Adams. His performance reminds me of his perform in Under Siege...eccentric but i can feel the vicious behind it. But then, that just it..this sequel didn't give enough space to develop Max's character.Guess, The Mechanic Resurrcetion is just another typical action movie will be soon forgotten as you put your feet into your doorstep or maybe soon as you leave the building.",Mechanic - Resurrection
143,archyros-30909,This was fun!,8,1 May 2017,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It was just a fun romp, nothing deep. Of course we know that the Mechanic, as portrayed by Jason Statham, is going to succeed in every mission/hit/assassination, but the fun is watching how he goes about it. And we get to see some beautiful locations, and beautiful actresses to go along for the ride. This is James Bond as a private assassin for hire, instead of the usual government employee, but with just as many gadgets. If you want to waste a couple hours watching mindless excitement, this one is for you!",Mechanic - Resurrection

145,abadguy44,A Rush...but not in a good way,4,28 November 2016,"The Mechanic ""franchise"" should be about an assassin that plans his kills in a meticulous manner and the process of the actual kill, not a James Bond ripoff. The story is too thin. Bishop is forced out of ""retirement"" by a childhood acquaintance and meets Gina, who after 2 days falls so in love with her that he wants to risk his life for her. This is not in character of Bishop. So the thread that was woven in the first Mechanic is completely destroyed. The kills are so rushed that it takes away from the suspense of the actual kill. All the kills lack the suspense that made the original Mechanic movie great. Statham is perfect for the role but the story needs to stay true to what made this a success in the first place. This movie lacks the feel of the life of a professional killer and his kills. It feels more like a James Bond movie and less like a hit-man movie. The kills should percolate and the story revolve around the hit not some girl in distress needs to be saved by a hero movie.",Mechanic - Resurrection

I struggled to remain interested in anything that was going on during the film, way to many plot holes. I love the old 80's style of action films, this tried a miraculously fails at capturing what made those films so great.

147,etheesdad,A big dip in quality for a Statham film,2,11 November 2016,"Wow, this really was a cynical exercise in taking a name-brand movie franchise and just whacking together a bunch of action sequences interspersed with moronic dialogue. Usually I love anything with Jason Statham in it as the films to date have been made to a standard thats worth watching. Not this. I switched off 30% into it. It was just too stupid to watch. The start of the film made no sense - there were so many plot holes it was just a total waste of time. In fact the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it had Jessica Alba in it. Even with her charm and looks, there was not much that could be done with the sheer dumbness of the storyline. Cmon Jason! Yeah you must have got paid but you really let your fans down on this one. I will definitely be thinking twice before paying to watch another one of your films after this. disappointing.",Mechanic - Resurrection
148,cmtrisket,I love Jason Statham!,7,27 April 2018,"First off let me tell you this as a disclaimer. I have a bit of an obsession with Jason Statham. It must be said before I continue, and yes it is hard to be objective about a movie that he stars in.Ok on to the specifics! the movie itself is 98 minutes long (1 hour & 38 minutes). Sometimes I want these movies to last longer, but they also have to have the content to extend them. So I believe, even though I want more, that this length is perfect for this type of movie. It is set in the genres above and that is spot on. It has an R rating, due to the nature of the violence and the language used throughout the movie. The language is generally sporadic and not the main reason for this rating. This is indeed the sequel to the 2012 movie ""The Mechanic"" (which I also loved). Jason Statham plays Arthur Bishop who is an assassin that specialized in accidental deaths. Jessica Alba plays his love interest Gina, and the curve ball of the group is Tommy Lee Jones who plays Max Adams one of Bishop's targets.So the story line is simply this: Bishop left his old life and assumed a new name. He is found by his old frienemy Crain (Sam Hazeldine). Crain wants Bishop to come out of his hiding/retirement and assassinate three high profile targets to keep his secret identity safe. Clearly like any movie he doesn't respond well, but is later put into a situation where Gina, is captured and held hostage until he eliminates the targets. Of course like always he has to keep each kill looking like an accident, in order to ensure the safety of Gina. You will have to watch and see about Tommy Lee Jones, I don't want to ruin it. That is about all I can say about it without giving anything away. I for one don't know if Jessica Alba was the right choice for this role. Yes she is/was a high profile star for some time. Yes she is attractive, but I feel like they shot too high for the roll in a way. I feel like it would be a better movie if there wasn't such a household name, so to speak, in that role. So in a way that is a compliment to Alba haha.Jason Statham has been my favorite actor for years now. I like, in a way, that he has stayed a 'B' list actor all while continuing to be the star in movies. His fight scenes in any movie are amazing. They are well thought out, well written, and very different than most. He opts to fight by hand to hand combat and use his soundings to his advantage. His slight accent makes him perfect for a ton of roles, as well as his physique, and demeanor. This movie, does have plenty of action, unlike ""Atomic Blonde"" which I reviewed previously. Yes is had fight scenes, but it also has helicopters, explosions, dangerous people, risky stunts, and more. This movie was never received well, partly because it isn't as main stream, and partly because it is a sequel to another movie that wasn't received all too well. That doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie.There are a couple negatives about this movie as well. This is the hard part for me to admit haha. Some of the explosions and fire graphics are far too fake. They really seem like they took no time at all to make them seem any bit real. Again being a bit picky, movies like this tend to allow pistols to hold 50 round magazines without having to re-load. This movie is guilty of that, unfortunately. The sound track is just blah, as it is your typical action suspense sounds. It was never there to be a hit sound track, and it won't be. I like to have a well rounded movie and that does in cooperate things like music and CGI. I want the whole package and this movie, like mannny others falls flat at times. In summary I love Jason Statham. I love his movies. I think his love interest was casted wrong, but it is only a minor thing. It is a typical action movie if that is what you are looking for. It has every piece you want to see, and you should watch it at least once. that way you can judge for yourself! :DThat all being said I would recommend watching this movie in any capacity! I personally give this movie a 6.5/10",Mechanic - Resurrection

The Statham does his thing, he's not worried about the plot, why would he be?

I don't have to conclude if something that's happening actually can. But with this movie it really forces you to see ALL the mistakes. There is no logic to the story what so ever. The action scenes are just meh... nothing anyone of us haven't seen numerous times and better.I hope that this movie is really a fluke and that the next movies are off the usual quality that we expect from Jason.

The scripting isn't an award winner but Statham is a true action actor. The real performer is Jessica Alba. Beautiful and sexy as always. The story maybe a little bit slow it does take a moment to get the jest. but in some areas it starts pretty much immediately. It takes a while for him to get the assassinations figured out, If you liked Jason in any of his other rolls, you'll enjoy this. Great cast and great action.

At 1:04:24 of the movie Jason Statham pulled the safety pin of the bomb and used the security guard as a human shield this move is unrealistic. This explosion would lead to Statham's death, which cannot happen as our lead character cannot die, he will pass gun wounds, knife cuts, bomb explosions and will survive but the enemies will not.

This was not one of those times. To be fair a Jason Statham movie comes with certain expectations of action and more action, however this was so over the top it was utter nonsense and by the end of the film I found myself looking to see how much time was left, a very bad sign. All in all a disappointing film that in my opinion should not have been made. Jason Statham is good for one action movie and then move on to the next project. I was hoping that he would have learned this from The Transporter, Crank and the Expendables. All good action flicks but forget the sequels.

Mission to killing the people were seems playing contra in childhood. by the first half only you will loose the charm. talented cast like Tommy lee was just a cameo as well as Jessica Alba and Michelle Yeoh. i am going with 3/10. 3 is just for appearance of the jason statham. go to theater only if you are die hard fan of jason. else you can skip this movie.,Mechanic - Resurrection

This movie turned that.Mechanic: Resurrection is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Although line-up crew promised that this movie should, at least, be worthy of spending some money, it turned out that this is not at all true. The filming locations were really great and that's about it when it gets to this movie. Bad acting (predominately by Alba and Lee Jones), combined with unconvincing story line (superficiality of good and, especially, bad characters) and mixed with non-imaginative CGI sequences turned this film into my first 1-star movie on IMDb.Luckily, I brought a phone with me so I could play some games during this projection.",Mechanic - Resurrection

Fight scenes resemble something from a Marvel television series,with the camera shots being swapped so often to hide the fact nobody can actually fight act you will get dizzy trying to watch it. The bad guys are all straight from a comic. The script; even Stan Lee wrote better for 12 year olds. Imagine a James Bond film made with 28 dollars and you get the picture.The hero is supposed to be an ex assassin yet does several dangerous jobs for the life of a woman he barely knows.

Jason Statham continues to carry enough weight for three man cards, at least. Jessica Alba is a marvelous woman of truth, strength, and resolve in both her character and her acting skills. Although the conversational writing occasionally showed juvenile tendencies, lacking the subtle art of ""show don't tell,"" I was more than willing to forgive this as the plot avoided any painted and forced points that typically push romance in similar movies. Tommy Lee Jones, of course, is marvelous Tommy Lee Jones and rounds out the cast with color and devious fun.

194,TeaLeavesAU,An unbelievable plot and a cheesy movie,3,22 December 2016,"The writing in this movie is bad from beginning to end.Like myself you are probably here to enjoy a decent Jason Statham action flick and this movie is anything but decent. The action parts are not bad, as expected I feel Jason has experience and good input into this area. The directing is average and done well, expect nothing less or more.The only reason I dislike this so much is because the writers could not pull off even an average plot for an average action flick. For some reason they let the writers get away with this because at some point the experience Jessica and Jason has must have hit and made them question whether this line or the plot should be executed in such manner.It's not the worse movie out there but certainly not one I would play and sit down with focus. This movie in the first 20 minutes made me realise the writing is pretty bad so I started to work out and do some cooking which is what I advise people do and you'll get through it and enjoy the few action scenes that you primarily wanted to see in a Jason Statham flick - it's an easy to follow movie.I'm not expecting good acting - I just want to see kick-ass Jason in a decently written/directed movie.It's so bad that I ended up finding who wrote it just to see their other works. Fact is Tony Mosher doesn't seem like he has done anything and Philip Shelby did Survivor which speaks for itself. Now both these guys have nothing superb under their belts but they're pretty old too which confuses me unless they just look old.How on earth did they come up with this movie is beyond me unless they were high and drugged up.This movie could be made better by ditching the love affair and damsel in distress and setting Jessica Alba as the antagonist who kills Jason and his local friend for information in the beginning. A true resurrection as Jason survives the hit and finds her organisation and begins to dismantle it with one inconspicuous death at a time.Cast Jessica into a bigger role, put her as an antagonist and even if we don't see great acting from her at least a fight scene between her and Jason would offer a great moment.Point is, an average plot for some kick-ass Jason moments - these writers couldn't even do that - it's below average work.",Mechanic - Resurrection

That one was fine but the sequel is just rubbish. Terrible story, terrible actors and no point of this even being a movie. They did Mechanic because the story was already there from Bronson's original so with this sequel it's like they hired a glodfish to write this movie. Two writers to write this garbage? Both you writers couldn't even write a food label let alone a movie thats how rubbish it is. I would have given it 0/10 if i had an option to. How Jason agreed to this movie is beyond me.

196,moshimaiya,Not as terrible as everyone says,7,2 July 2017,"I don't know if it was down to a timing limit or whether the fast pace needed to be there throughout the film, but I have to agree with those who say its a bit unbelievable from a plot standpoint. I feel like the whole establishing of a relationship between Statham's character (Bishop) and Alba's (Gina) happens too quickly. They go from having a mutual problem to sleeping together to boy friend and girlfriend within minutes. If this was down to a timing restriction, then I do believe that it was dealt with fairly well and in an acceptable way. I do, however, wish that the relationship could have had more time in the beginning.From an action standpoint I think Statham excelled at fulfilling his wish to make it seem as if Bishop was working with his environment. Not once did I believe that someone of his skill set wouldn't be able to get out of the position he was in. The action aspect of the movie provides a lot of it, and it does bring one to the edge of their seat, even if there are no mishaps. So perhaps maybe a few should have been included, so that an audience member is left with a firm belief that nothing can go wrong. A little mishap would have increased the levels of suspense, like perhaps when vacuuming to the bottom of the pool Bishop slips up and one handle doesn't attach properly. Ultimately I enjoyed this movie and it provided a fairly decent story.",Mechanic - Resurrection

He is found by his old friend who have a proof that he is alive and in return have a task for Bishop, three kills to look like accidents.

Statham played so well as always and ALba was good too. the main problem of the move was the story line which everything happened so quick that i felt they were in a hurry to make this movie. for example a TV series like Prison break can't be summarized into a movie and mechanic resurrection felt like a prison break series summarized into one movie with only 90 minutes.

For a long time I did not see such a bad movie and I do not remember watching a god movie recently. Really bad casting, no story at all. The movie is keep switching between boring, awfully sweet, to hyper actions. This movie actually remembered me on the Raging Sharks movie. The story is completely without a common sense. The same ship was in Sydney harbor and on the next day was in Black see? Guys what did you smoke? Did you ever see the globe? From today on Bishop (Statham) is my new supper hero! After one day in Sydney he had its own mobile laboratory! I am not sure how did he get so much equipment in such a short time. Not that I expected much from Jason Statham, but this was less than zero. Like he was forced to act in this movie. The only good part of this movie was Jessica Alba lying on the beach and her jump into the see. Please if you have 100 minutes of your time, try to do something else than watching this movie.

One of the biggest flaws of the movie is that nothing is well thought out. It seemed as if they just shot random scenes with required plot lines, such as love and revenge just to quickly fit it in to the overall story.One of the craziest things is the fact that Statham is absolutely invincible in the movie. Not once does it seem like he's in any kind of danger. Another glaring weakness is after he has made two kills and then decides just to go try to kill the main protagonist of the film. He tries this and fails, and then gets to just continue on with the third kill as if nothing happened.

Bishop takes a picture of her and fights off her mercenaries before escaping. Bishop goes to Thailand and takes shelter at the beach house of his friend, Mae. He investigates the woman and learns that her employer is a man named Riah Crain.An attractive young woman named Gina Thorne arrives at the shore and, when she asks Mae for some first aid items, Mae notices a split lip and bruising on her arm that suggest she is being treated badly. That evening, Mae notices the young woman being attacked in her boat and convinces Bishop to go out to help. He boards the boat, but his attempts to warn off the man go unheeded and in the ensuing altercation the man falls, hits his head on a piece of the boat's equipment and is killed. Mae arrives, to take Gina to shore, and Bishop quickly explores the ship for clues before setting fire to it to cover his tracks. Bishop learns that the young lady is called Gina, and is working for Crain and confronts her, who reveals that she was working in a children shelter in Cambodia and Crain threatened those children and forced her to arrive at Bishop's location. Bishop deduces that Crain's plan was to make him fall for her before she is kidnapped and thus Bishop will be forced to accept the mission. Later, Bishop notices Crain's operatives watching him and gets intimate with Thorne. He reveals to her that he and Crain were sold to a gangster when they were orphan children. They were trained as warriors until Bishop escaped. Bishop and Thorne end up having sex before they are both abducted the next morning. Bishop is brought to Crain, who gives the identities of the three targets.The first target of Bishop is a warlord named Krill, who is incarcerated in a Malaysian prison. Bishop travels to Malaysia and gets himself imprisoned to access Krill. Bishop gains Krill's trust by killing a man already planning on killing Krill. Bishop meets with Krill and kills him and Bishop escapes the prison with the help of Crain's operatives.Bishop is informed that he only has 36 hours to kill the next target, Adrian Cook, who runs an underage trafficking ring in Sydney, Australia.

They arrange a meeting; but Crain is revealed to be planning to have Bishop killed.Bishop kills Crain's men before heading toward Crain's boat, where he fights more mercenaries before getting to Crain. Bishop finds Thorne, and they discover that Crain has the boat rigged to explode. Bishop puts Thorne in an underwater escape chamber pod to let her escape and goes to find Crain and defeats him in hand to hand combat. Bishop leaves Crain chained with an anchor chain to the boat and escapes moments before the boat explodes, killing Crain. Thorne is told that there have been no survivors.Thorne returns to Cambodia to continue her work. She is surprised when Bishop shows up.

Enough - we want ass kicking, blowing up stuff killer effects etc in these kinds of movies with story lines that move with fluidity from scene to scene, not this crap that looks like it was given to a bunch of HS students as a ""here's how you put together an i movie project for your final in theater class"". It seemed like towards the end of the movie after they intro's Tommy Lee Jones, thank you very much for that BTW - things started looking up, but heaven help us until then things were moving at such a glacial pace that even a turtle would have given up on this one! Oh and don't even get me started on Jessica Alba and the 1000 x's she yelled out ""BISHOP"" - seriously did she have any other lines in this movie?",Mechanic - Resurrection
226,keegancoutriers,Contender for worst movie I've ever seen!,1,24 January 2017,"This movie should not even be considered B grade because it's much worse than that. Tommy Lee Jones is looking for a easy pay day and Jessica Alba has never been much of an actress, Jason Statham tries to deliver but falls flat as well. The directing along with the poor and predictable script writing is utterly appalling. This combined with the standard of acting makes this movie almost unbearable.Has to be the worst Statham movie ever!I'm sure 90% of people who watched this film feel ripped off!Cannot believe that this movie grossed more than 3 times its budget!",Mechanic - Resurrection
227,tallinen-93319,"No logical movie at all, full of stupid actions and things that just don't make sense",2,12 March 2017,"Jason is falling deeply in love with a girl he just met and it comes the main purpose of his quiet and secret life to rescue this woman Thailand, Australia, Hungary...? Why? What was the reason? They're jumping from the place to another, diving with a single tank and cheap DPV, navigating underwater from Hungary to some tropical island? Jail island...w t f? most stupid scene I've ever seen. You feel stupid when you watch this, but when you forget that - just laugh and wait for the next cheap action in the movie. Tommy Lee Jones's high security submarine center, no one can enter and many people have tried and died, but they just drive in with a speedboat and it's empty.Dennis Gansel should change his profession, that's definitely not directing movies. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Only positives are Jason's acting as a action hero and Jessica's ass. Her acting was like a soap opera, which this movie actually was.",Mechanic - Resurrection
228,turnipbeet,Why?,1,3 January 2020,The plot makes no sense at all. It's just unbearable to watch till the end.,Mechanic - Resurrection
229,GreatGGirl,awful awful awful,1,1 August 2017,This movie really is really awful. When it started in Brazil I thought great. Nice scenery. Lots of attractive men. I should have known when the location changed from Brazil to Thailand.I got as far as the first sex scene. Why use abused children as a plot contrivance while the lead is banging a woman who looks young enough to be his daughter. Really offensive.As it turns out Alba is 36 not 16 to his 50 but the dreadful image is still there.Doesn't Thailand have any normal women? Or attractive men?,Mechanic - Resurrection
230,tompazuelo,Horrible movie.,1,25 September 2017,"Horrible movie. Poor effects, script, acting. A movie with zero intelligence and respect for it's viewers. Everything from start to finish is so predictable, all problems are solved easily, it's just not reliable. Too bad Jason f***ing Statham, who is, imo, a very talented actor, chose to act in this poor movie. 1/10",Mechanic - Resurrection
231,iannish,Bad portrayal of Penang ...cheap movie,1,13 January 2018,"Depiction of Penang where John stay looks like a run down shack, which does not exist. Penang streets depicted in the movie looks like a back alley of new York, dirty, trashy and disgusting. Penang is nothing close to that. Please do not misrepresent my island just so to fit in a profile to suit your western mindset. This is a disgusting movie.",Mechanic - Resurrection
232,ahmedakter-30081,Love for Alba,10,11 April 2020,Two of my most favourite actors in a film is enough for me to give 10.,Mechanic - Resurrection
233,luxuryrenovations,Right up there with the Mission Impossibles series,10,15 October 2018,"I'm completely perplexed by the bad reviewers on this one. No one is tougher on movies than I, and I'm not even all that much into this (sometimes mindless) action movie genre, but this one had me in the first 5 minutes. Gorgeous exotic locales, a great plot, good acting by all, awesome action sequences, and fun gadgetry, and the gorgeous stars . . . . what in the heck was there not to like? I highly recommend this movie!",Mechanic - Resurrection
