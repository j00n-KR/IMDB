0,MartinHafer,An agreeable time-passer for those who usually hate Jim Carey's over-acting,7,25 November 2006,"Okay, I won't keep it a secret. I am not a fan of Jim Carey and think most of his films are designed for a very undiscerning audience (especially teens). Subtle, they are NOT! However, I did mildly like BRUCE ALMIGHTY--mostly because Carey's usual ranting and raving is under some control. This still isn't Masterpiece Theater, but it's a far cry from DUMB AND DUMBER or ACE VENTURA!! I think what I liked best about the film (other than restraining Carey) was that this film had an actual plot and a message--and surprisingly enough, one that probably WON'T offend most religious people despite its premise. Bruce is a self-centered jerk who tends to blame God for his problems instead of looking at his own contributions to his predicaments. Again and again, he says it's all God's fault that his life is a mess. Apparently, God has a sense of humor and approaches Bruce with a proposition--""if you can do better then the job is yours!"" As an almighty deity, Bruce does not do that many funny things that you probably didn't see in the film's previews a few years back. But, he does learn a valuable lesson and the film is pretty entertaining, though slight in its aspirations. A very good time-passer, but not as interesting or having lasting appeal like THE TRUMAN SHOW.",Bruce Almighty
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Does have its hilarious moments, and is performed well, but it doesn't sizzle as much as it should have done",7,1 November 2009,"Bruce Almighty is a decent movie. It is no masterpiece, but it is still entertaining, is well performed and has a sense of fun. The reason why I don't think is a masterpiece is mainly because of various factors it didn't quite convince as much as it should have done.The movie has a good soundtrack, and a great premise. The performances are what made the movie as entertaining as it was, with Jim Carrey in his usual over the top performance pitch-perfect as Bruce Nolan and Jennifer Aniston as lovely as ever as Grace. Steve Carrell has his moments as Evan Baxter. The real acting kudos though has to go to Morgan Freeman, who is such an exceptional actor who rarely disappoints in anything he's in, and he was great as God. There are as I have said some hilarious moments, the news station scenes were particularly hysterical.However, there are some problems that marred an otherwise decent movie. The middle act is rather slow moving and not very much of interest happens sadly. I also found it rather short for a comedy, if it were fifteen minutes or so longer it could have had more scenes to develop the characters and story more. And while on the whole the movie worked there are parts in the script that are overdone.On the whole, despite being disappointingly uneven, it is a fun and decent comedy, that is well performed and has a nice message. Plus the ending is a tear jerker. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Bruce Almighty
2,SnoopyStyle,Jim Carrey vehicle,6,9 November 2013,"Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a disgruntled small TV reporter in Buffalo. Everything seems to be going against him, and he rages against God (Morgan Freeman). To teach him a lesson, God endows Bruce with all his powers. Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend Grace Connelly.Jim Carrey's manic behavior can be quite grating. He's not that likable at the start. He is full of himself, and does too much complaining. Once he gets his powers, his attics are much more funnier. He and Jennifer Aniston are actually fun together.This movie is funnier as a premise. When you get down to it, Bruce is selfish. The constant referencing of 'It's a Wonderful Life' just reminds me how much nicer George Bailey is. Bruce is no George Bailey.",Bruce Almighty
3,Hitchcoc,What Would You Do As God?,6,11 January 2017,"I suppose what this film is saying is that given the opportunity Bruce is given, the natural thing to do is to act entirely selfishly, feathering your own nest, and being crass and insensitive. He uses what he has been given to be self indulgent and selfish. I guess there is some religious message in all this, since God actually appears (the soft spoken Morgen Freeman). I guess because Jim Carrey's persona is at the center, we don't get took see God pick a person who has lapsed into despair over the state of the world, the treatment of women, the abuse of children. Yes, i know it's a comedy, but it has that heavy handed stuff in it that says, ""There is only one way."" Of course, Carrey will eventually have too much of a good thing and abuse his powers because he never had any character to begin with. He learns at the end, but only after he has a bit of guilt for causing death and destruction. Mostly, he is clueless. By the way, is Morgen Freeman an American Christian God or does he represent the world in general? Just asking.",Bruce Almighty
4,claudio_carvalho,I Expected Much More Than That,5,26 December 2003,"Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is an external and funny TV network correspondent, competing with his colleague Evan Baxter (Steven Carell) the position of 'anchor' in the TV news. He lives with Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), a teacher of children, who loves and wants to marry him. Bruce is a very selfish, grudging and envious man. While presenting a live event in Niagara Falls, he is informed that Evan was chosen as the new anchor man. Bruce gets crazy, says a lot of wicked and non-sense things to the audience and is fired. Bruce blames God, and sooner he is called by Him. God (Morgan Freeman) decides to go on vacations for a week and gives all His powers and duties to Bruce, but the power of changing the free will. With his greed, Bruce commits lots of mistakes, but in the end he is redeemed. The plot of this movie could be funnier. However, the nasty personality of Bruce does not help much. Jennifer Aniston is beautiful as usual and performs a nice character. I myself expected much more of this movie. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""O Todo Poderoso"" (""The Almighty"")",Bruce Almighty
5,kosmasp,Some laugh out loud moments,6,10 October 2007,"Quite some few I'd say. The pairing of Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman seems to be a genius one. Throw in Steve Carell for good measure (and a beautiful newscast scene, where Jim Carreys character is ""playing"" him) and you're good to go.The story(line) is simple and there's not much to it. Still it takes some time to take off, maybe too much, while introducing all the characters and some of Bruce's (Jim C.) flaws. But overall you can't stop wondering, what's wrong with this guy. I mean he kind of has it all and still isn't satisfied. While that might be acceptable as a fact, any other actor might have had much more problems selling this to the audience. Even Jim quite can't hold this up. But maybe, I'm thinking too much ... my niece, her brother and their friends really enjoyed this ... so there you go. A family comedy that does deliver!",Bruce Almighty
6,lee_eisenberg,God bless this movie!,8,16 July 2005,"Some people say that comedians should do more serious roles. ""Bruce Almighty"" proves that Jim Carrey works best in comedy. He plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who can't make it to anchorman. That is, until he meets God (Morgan Freeman), who gives him divine powers for a week (with a few precautions). So, Bruce uses his new abilities to take revenge on all who have wronged him, including giving one man an unpleasant experience with a monkey. But Bruce also figures out a way to make his fiancée Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) really fall for him.The whole thing is completely silly in the same way as ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"", ""The Mask"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"". But mark my words, no part of ""Bruce Almighty"" is ever dull. God bless Jim Carrey!",Bruce Almighty
7,jboothmillard,Bruce Almighty,6,20 February 2011,"The leading star hadn't made a slapstick comedy since The Grinch, and the concept of this one sounded really good, and it was good to know he was reuniting with the director that made him a star, Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Nutty Professor, Liar Liar). Basically Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a news reporter for Channel 7 Eyewitness News in Buffalo, New York, with girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), and he dreams of one day being the new anchor, but this is taken away by the annoying Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) who rubs Bruce's nose in it. Bruce has a series of really bad luck and feels like he is being picked on by God, and when he really breaks he lets rip with blasphemy and insult to the big guy in the sky. Then he gets a message from an unknown number, inviting him to a secluded building, and that is where he meets God (Morgan Freeman), and eventually he says he is going to give Bruce the chance to do his job better, by giving him all his powers. When Bruce has mastered the use of the powers of the almighty, he uses them to his advantage, to make himself a bigger name in the news reporting stakes, but leaves little room for time with Grace and the meaningful things. God also reminds him that with all his powers he has responsibilities, most importantly answering people praying, so Bruce sets up a Yahweh! account on his computer to answers prayers as emails, but he is lazy and just says ""yes"" to all, which slowly causes worldwide chaos. When Bruce gets the opportunity to be the new male anchor, after making Evan look a fool, he lets it go to really sort out the world's problems, and then he finds out Grace is one who prays too, and he gets upset with what he hears. In the end he decides he doesn't want to be God anymore, God takes the powers away, and Bruce goes back to normal with a seemingly improved life with Grace. Also starring Philip Baker Hall as Jack Baylor, Catherine Bell as Susan Ortega, Lisa Ann Walter as Debbie and Tony Bennett. Carrey is really likable as the newscaster using God's powers in a cool way, Aniston is appealing as his slightly unappreciated girlfriend, and Freeman makes a very cool and majestic God. Obviously all of the best jokes come from Carrey using the divine powers, best part being making Carell talk gibberish, and also making Aniston's boobs bigger, blowing a woman's skirt up, and much more, a fun comedy fantasy. Good!",Bruce Almighty
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Lightweight, Fun Look At Thelogy",8,17 February 2008,"As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah!Theology-wise, puh-leeze!!! God is still made to look and think like humans...and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. Being the lightweight comedy it is, it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. There are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, audiences - from Christians to atheists.- got something out of this besides a few laughs, such as what prayer should really be all about. Kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message.Overall, it's a good-hearted film that should offend very few.",Bruce Almighty
9,Tweekums,Jim Carrey becomes God,7,4 June 2018,"Bruce Nolan is a news reporter working for a TV station in Buffalo, New York. He isn't satisfied with his life though; he is fed up of getting the more lightweight stories to report on while his rival Evan gets the more serious stories. When Bruce learns that Evan has been promoted to a job he wanted just before he presents a live report he finally snaps. This cost him his job and soon it seems as if everything is going wrong for him; the only thing good in his life is his girlfriend Grace although he somewhat takes her for granted. As more and more things go wrong he starts to blame God for all his woes... then one day he receives a strange message offering him a job. He goes to see what it is about and finds himself face to face with God! God proceeds to give Bruce his powers and tells him to do his job for a while. At first everything is great as he uses the powers to his own advantage but there are consequences; when he tries to help others by answering their prayers things get even worse... Bruce learns that being God isn't easy.If you are a fan of Jim Carrey then I expect you'll enjoy this as he is on fine form as Bruce. His gurning style may be too much for some people but for the most part he is funny rather than annoying. The story is entertaining and despite the subject matter I don't think it will offend too many people... it is never stated that God is the god of any one faith and his depiction is respectful; the fact that he is played by an on form Morgan Freeman helps of course. There are plenty of very funny moments; the best being a slightly crude scene involving a gang member and a monkey. The supporting cast is solid; most notably Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell as girlfriend Grace and rival Evan. The film's conclusion is hardly surprising but that isn't a problem; we can enjoy the journey even though we know the destination. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh; especially if you are a fan of Jim Carrey.",Bruce Almighty
10,moonspinner55,Comic-fantasy preys on the undiscriminating viewer...,3,28 February 2007,"Fans of Jim Carrey, who enjoy him on-screen no matter what he does, will no doubt like ""Bruce Almighty"" for it is designed to be a Jim Carrey vehicle, a showcase for the actor and nothing more. He plays Bruce, an unlucky news-reporter for a Buffalo TV station who blames all his troubles on God; after a meeting with the Almighty himself, Bruce gets a chance to see how tough God's job is by being blessed with extraordinary powers. Naturally, this being a Jim Carrey vehicle, he gets silly and parts the Red Sea--actually, his tomato soup--in his soup-bowl, causes a co-worker to lose control on live television, and turns himself into a romantic stud with his girlfriend. This all works for awhile, but when prayers start piling up and Bruce makes the lazy decision to grant everyone his wish, the movie runs out of comic steam and becomes a sticky mess. Out of three-million-plus prayers answered, the troubles which quickly result seem to happen only in Bruce's town (are residents of Buffalo the only God-seeking people on Earth?). The milieu isn't Buffalo anyway, it's a distinct movie back-lot, and the artificial mechanics of this plot matched with the phony look can make one defensive and angry--but only if he or she isn't a Jim Carrey die-hard. It's a movie assembled by agents and managers and stars, and fans will no doubt enjoy it. *1/2 from ****",Bruce Almighty
11,studioAT,An almighty comedy,8,3 August 2010,Love him or hate him Jim Carrey is a master at what he does. He's showcased that in films prior to this (Liar Liar) and in his newer films (Yes man). Much like Bruce he has the ability to bring joy to so many people.The basic concept of an ordinary man being given the Lords powers is funny on its own but what Carrey and the writers do is create a film that has all the big laughs that a comedy needs while also creating characters that we care about and can relate to. The film also has a moral and a tenderness that Carrey can portray in.While it's clear that this is Carreys film he his ably supported by Jennifer Aniston and the then up and coming Steve Carell who would later become the lead in this films sequel Evan Almighty.The casting of Morgan Freeman in the role of God is also inspired and there are few actors who could play this part with such grace.Overall a great comedy that really acts as a vehicle for the fantastic comedic talent of Jim Carrey.,Bruce Almighty
12,sunwarrior13,Jim Carrey Is God,9,23 September 2012,"Bruce Almighty is a fantasy comedy about a down-on-his-luck TV reporter who complains to God that He isn't doing His job correctly, and is then offered the chance to try being God himself for one week.It stars Jim Carrey together with Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, Catherine Bell, Lisa Ann Walter, and Philip Baker Hall.It was directed by Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.Bruce Nolan is a TV reporter working in Buffalo, NY, who has been growing increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and after an especially bad day, he flies into a rage and curses God for making his life miserable. To Bruce's great surprise, the Supreme Being Himself appears, and tries to convince Bruce of the enormity of his task. Bruce, however, isn't buying it, so God gives him a chance to find out what he's up against.Also,He bestows all of his powers on Bruce for a week, to see how he'd handle things. At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace, but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum wherein he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void. Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes being the Supreme Almighty and it has an interesting premise wherein he plays God.Also,the film mostly succeeds at fusing his talents as a comedian which makes it a funny and heartwarming movie.It is the kind of movie that is made for Jim Carrey himself and no one could play the main character perfectly except him.",Bruce Almighty
13,bevo-13678,Similar,10,26 January 2021,I like Jim carrey movies because they are all exactly the same,Bruce Almighty
14,hitchcockthelegend,Being God can be Hell.,7,11 August 2014,"Fans of Jim Carrey can't go wrong with this fun filled picture that's not without serious undertones as well.The Premise is flimsy as such, Carrey plays Nolan, a harried and fed up TV reporter who feels that all of his problems are God's fault. Having enough of his whingeing, God (Morgan Freeman) summons Nolan to his ""residence"" and bestows all his powers to him. This is where the film hits its stride, the makers letting Carrey loose for a number of funny sequences as he plays God to further his own ends.It goes where you expect it to, and nobody else gets a look in as Carrey does his stuff, but the journey is a most pleasant one. 7/10",Bruce Almighty
15,jotix100,Buffalo Bruce,5,30 May 2003,"If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie!If you hate to part with $10.00 for a mediocre film, buy a paperback book and stay home.If you must see a tired formula film, please wait until it's shown on TV and think what a clever decision you made.",Bruce Almighty
16,Hey_Sweden,Hilarious Carrey vehicle.,8,30 June 2013,"Jim Carrey gets an ideal showcase for his comedic and dramatic talents with this endearing fantasy-comedy. He plays Bruce Nolan, a Buffalo reporter obliged to do silly fluff pieces. What he really desires is an anchor position, and when it's given to jerk character Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), that pushes Bruce over the edge. He's already convinced that God is out to get him, and curses God, prompting the Almighty to take the form of Morgan Freeman and appear to Bruce. God decides to grant Bruce all of His divine powers for a week, to give Bruce a chance to see if he can do any better.This is a Hollywood movie, of course, and there is a formula to be found in these things, and Bruces' story is at its core a tale of a guy who ultimately learns a lesson and becomes a better person. Before we get to that point, there are some absolutely priceless bits where a confident Bruce delights in his abilities, first just testing them out and then using them strictly to his own advantage, contriving news events so that he can be on hand for them and become a reporting star. Soon, Bruce learns that there is a tremendous responsibility in being God and that he will have to put selfishness aside. He can't take the job lightly, either, although some of his attempts to solve the problem are a howl (that's such a memorable visual when everything in his apartment is covered in post-it notes). Also, with Bruce interfering so much in the course of events in the universe, there will be consequences that he didn't consider.Freeman, with his effortless charisma, screen presence, and sense of authority, is a natural choice to put a human face on The Almighty. He gives Him a sense of humour and works very well with the energetic Carrey. Jennifer Aniston does a fine job of grounding the material as Bruces' sweet girlfriend. The excellent Philip Baker Hall leads a fun supporting cast in which the always amusing Carell stands out. He, of course, got promoted to star status for the sequel ""Evan Almighty"".This is fairly manipulative, to be sure, but that's also par for the course with this sort of thing. Still, it's likable and has enough good laughs to size up as another solid teaming between Carrey and director Tom Shadyac, who worked with Carrey on ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" and ""Liar Liar"". Anybody who's a fan of the actors should find this to be quite agreeable overall.Eight out of 10.",Bruce Almighty
17,Boba_Fett1138,A great comedy! still too bad about its second halve.,7,26 January 2007,"This is a greatly crafted and funny comedy, starring Jim Carrey in top-shape.The premise is a great comedy one. A 'normal' every day guy getting God's power, who of course at first start using it for his own benefit and pleasure but soon starts to realize the great responsibility of it and of the ability to help out people. It of course gives the movie plenty of material to create some fun and hilarious sequences around this premise. The movie is also filled with comical moments like this, which makes ""Bruce Almighty"" a very enjoyable and fun to watch movie. Definitely better than 90% of the comedies being released in cinemas these days.Jim Carrey really makes the movie funny. He plays his character in a great comedy way and provides the movie with a couple of hilarious sequences but he also is great and convincing in the more 'serious' moments in the movie. But it seems a bit silly that he's spoofing some of his old previous comedy roles. It's never a good sign when a comedian starts to spoof his own previous roles. It often means that their careers are over, though I don't expect to be this the case with Jim Carrey.Too bad that, like always, Jim Carrey has to carry the entire movie on its own. Sure, the movie features many other big names, such as Morgan Freeman, Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston and Philip Baker Hall but when it comes down to the comedy of the movie, Carrey is mostly on his own, although I think that this is also the way he likes it. Morgan Freeman is a good and fun God and Steve Carell also provides the movie with a couple of laughs. And regarding Jennifer Aniston; Sorry. Never have really been a big Jennifer Aniston fan, not even of her looks.The second halve of the movie becomes way too moralistic and preachy toward the ending. The movie tries to bring over a moralistic message in a too forced and obvious way. It causes the second halve of the movie to be less fun, though it obviously still features some great comedy moments. This sort of moralistic movie and story can only work once, so I also don't have very high hopes for the sequel ""Evan Almighty"". I just don't think it will work out.The movie is well directed and has some excellent comedy timing. It shows that Tom Shadyac knows how to handle the genre and should definitely continue making genre movies like these (but just not if it are sequels!).A recommendable comedy, despite the more annoyingly preachy and moralistic second halve.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bruce Almighty
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,OK Jim Carrey comedy,6,21 February 2004,"Jim Carrey hasn't been in a comedy for a couple of years; in fact, he hasn't done anything but some not-too-good dramas, so naturally, his fans were expecting a lot from the film that would mark his ""return"" to comedy. I believe that a lot of people, especially Christians, are offended by this, because of the somewhat comic portrayal of God, among other things. I didn't find said things offensive, though I can understand how some might find them offending. However, if we forget about the immediate offense some will take from the very theme of this film, and look further, we'll find an okay attempt at explaining faith and God, without simplifying or mocking. Yes, the attempt is hidden behind a lot of (so-so) comedy, but if you look closer, there are a lot of references to Christianity and perhaps even a few metaphors. It's not a particularly funny or effective comedy, in spite of director Tom Shadyac's track record with working with Carrey, but it's not awful. The jokes are found more in special effects, and situations we accept because of the power harnessed(and given that, one might have expected more interesting things to happen) by the title character... rather than Carrey's performance, the dialog or other material. I'd recommend this to any fan of Jim Carrey. Just don't expect it to be as funny as his best work(I maintain that Steve Oedekerk is unfunny and ought to stay away from Jim). 6/10",Bruce Almighty

Bemoaning his lot to God, he is astonished to discover that God is not only listening, his solution is to give a full set of powers to Bruce. But will this solve Bruce's problems?No, of course it won't. It will simply create more but, hopefully, along the way, he will gain an insight into what he really wants and, maybe the best way to get it.Jim Carrey, as Bruce, gets another opportunity to indulge in some physical humour as he tries out his divine powers, not always in the most philanthropic of ways. Morgan Freeman is a likeable God, Jennifer Aniston a satisfactory love interest, and Steve Carell steals the show with some rogue speech.This film is good fun.",Bruce Almighty
20,ferguson-6,Not so mighty Bruce,6,28 May 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  High expectations mean more critical grading.  This one really fails to deliver because it was presented as a return to comedy by Jim Carrey.  Very few laughs, other than the obvious gags shown in the previews.  Director Tom Shadyac is making a career of working with the best known comics: Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy.  He seems to have very little control.  Jennifer Anniston shows she may be ready for movie stardom, otherwise not worth 2 hours.",Bruce Almighty
21,anaconda-40658,Jim Almighty.,7,19 June 2015,"Bruce Almighty (2003): Dir: Tom Shadyac / Cast: Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Philip Baker Hall, Steve Carell: Film about the suspension of self. Bruce Nolan works for a news network where he is bypassed for position as night anchorman. He lives with his girlfriend and a dog that uses the sofa as a toilet. He blames God for his misfortunes until God meets with him and proposes him his job. Bruce enlarges his girlfriend's breasts and makes his dog literally use the toilet. Provocative yet predictable with a touching climax. Directed by Tom Shadyac who previously collaborated with Carrey on the inferior Liar Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Jim Carrey displays our frustration and lack of understanding of who God is. Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is straight forward seeking to move on to the next stage of their relationship. She is merely a prop for sexual sight jokes. Morgan Freeman plays off the wisdom of God who steps aside and allows Bruce to realize the true nature of God although Bruce becoming the likeness of Clint Eastwood fails because it is the media concept of Eastwood instead of God's creation of him. Philip Baker Hall also makes an appearance, and Steve Carell is also featured in a sabotaging segment that doesn't elevate his comic potential to the heights it would later reach. Film demonstrates God's power and our inability to fathom it. Score: 7 / 10",Bruce Almighty
22,HotToastyRag,Jim Carrey's last hit,5,12 June 2017,"Bruce Almighty had such a promising premise: a man, disillusioned with God, suddenly meets The Man is given his powers. Prayers come in to Bruce, and he has ""almighty"" power to do whatever he wants, which, since this is a comedy, includes adjusting his girlfriend's breast size and destroying a co-worker's career.This movie marked the last Jim Carrey movie that most people saw in the theaters. After this came his dramatic turn in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the quirky, hard-to-market A Series of Unfortunate Events, and finally the less-than-stellar remake of Fun with Dick and Jane. So, if you're an old-school Carrey fan and want to see his last hit, you can rent this one. It does have a few funny gags in it, but it's easy and sad to tell he's on the decline.",Bruce Almighty
23,movieman_kev,"not the best Carrey, nor the worst",6,2 June 2005,"A lowly newscaster (Jim Carrey) who's stuck doing 'human interest' stories, very unhappy with his lot in life after getting fired and curses God for his misfortunes, meets up with the big G himself (Morgan Freeman) when he's continuously paged by him. Seems that god wants to give him all of his powers to show him how hard it is. Jennifer Aniston is really not good in the part as Bruce's girlfriend in this one. And Carrey spends too much of the time acting.. well like typical crazy Carrey. But I guess the message is sweet enough to warrant this watchable, if not particularly funny. But quite frankly the best parts belong to Steve Carell and the great Philip Baker Hall.My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Tom Shaydac; The Process of Jim featurette; 17 outtakes; 15 Deleted scenes with optional commentary; an ad for Mastercard (???

24,Wuchakk,What would you do with God-like powers?,7,21 January 2016,"Released in 2003, ""Bruce Almighty"" chronicles what happens when God (Morgan Freeman) gives His powers to a complaining news anchor (Jim Carrey) and takes a vacation. Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's girlfriend and Steve Carell his rival anchor; Catherine Bell and Lisa Ann Walter are also on hand.In my opinion this is better than 1977's ""Oh God!"" because Morgan Freeman is superior in the role of the Almighty. Plus, how can you go wrong with Jim Carrey? While the movie starts off rather dull it perks up as soon as Bruce (Carrey) acquires God's powers; and for a solid half hour there are loads of laughs. At the end of the second act, however, the movie sorta nosedives, but then recovers in the last act with some surprisingly moving and even inspiring material. The movie runs 101 minutes and was shot in Buffalo, New York City, San Diego and the Los Angeles area. GRADE: B",Bruce Almighty
25,Sylviastel,A Crack at Taking God's Job!,7,12 June 2008,"Bruce Nolan was an aspiring journalist who wanted nothing more than the local anchorman job in Buffalo, New York instead of doing funny bits of news like the introduction where he is at Polish bakery celebrating the city's largest chocolate chip cookie. It starts off smart but it wears thin overall. Bruce is played by the unforgettable Jim Carrey who is brilliant at physical comedy much like John Ritter, Don Knotts, and Jerry Lewis in this film. Morgan Freeman plays God who transfers his powers to him to see what it would be like to be God. So Bruce is now God and he must hear prayers and confessions of everybody. God's job is not easy if you are believer. He has a lot of work but I take this comedy as is rather than serious drama. Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend (how did Brad Pitt trade her for Angelina is beyond me?). She is equally superb in the straight woman role. There are supporting players like Steve Carrell, Nora Dunn, and Sally Kirkland to name only a few.",Bruce Almighty
26,namashi_1,Wonderful...,10,9 September 2010,"How would you handle the most awesome responsibility in the universe? Asks, the 2003-classic 'Bruce Almighty'. Some films have a certain feel to them, and this is amongst those films.Jim Carrey stars as Bruce, who often complains to the man above, of how unlucky and how unkind he's been to him. One fine day, the Almighty appears, played by Morgan Freeman. He gives his powers to him see if he can do a better job.'Bruce Almighty' is a film that I've loved ever since it's release. I remember watching it in L.A., Universal City Walk. I was awed by it, it's such a touching & moving cinematic experience. It has it's share of hilarious moments, but its the penultimate 30-minutes, when the goings-on get serious, those are the portions that leave a strong impression. You weep in your seat and you exit the auditorium in glee.Steve Oedekerk, Steve Koren & Mark O'Keefe's Screenplay is legendary. Tom Shadyac's execution to the genius Screenplay is completely justified. Dean Semler's Cinematography is super.In the acting department, Jim Carrey proves his caliber, yet again. He becomes Bruce from scene A itself. He is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman as God, is wonderfully relaxed. Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's Lady-Love is remarkable. This truly ranks amongst her best performances! Steve Carell fumbles beautifully. Catherine Bell looks ravishing! Her performance is just right.On the whole, One of the Finest Films of 2003. A film that not only entertains, but also leaves you enlightened. Two Big Thumbs Up!",Bruce Almighty
27,StevePulaski,When a sketch would've done justice to the material at hand...,5,20 January 2013,"Bruce Almighty could very well be the one film where Jim Carrey gives everything he's got, making a character so over-the-top and goofy that it would go on to be one of his best performances. Not in my eyes. From the first few frames with Jim Carrey's character, I knew this endeavor may not go so well and, sure enough, I was correct. It has taken me a long time to warm to Carrey the same way I've warned to actors such as Jack Black, but his crazy personality is something that has left me quite annoyed in many of his films. Upon seeing it, I was a little disappointed by how bumbling and idiotic both him and Jeff Daniels were in Dumb and Dumber, yet the film now seems to be one of Carrey's stronger works when put under the same light as this film.To put it simply, this is a tired comedy exercise, unsuccessfully blending its religious premise with slapstick, and tacking on mawkish sentimentality making the last thirty minutes a gooey slog to watch. We follow Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), a second-rate reporter for a news station in Buffalo, New York, who has just lost an open anchoring positioning to Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), the conniving, smarmy man who loves one-upping Bruce. Frustrated and angry, Bruce throws a fit while interviewing people at Niagara Falls, costing him his job, which causes him to yell at his wife (Jennifer Aniston) and focus all his blame on God for shifting focus on him.Bruce then receives persistent pager messages from an unknown number, which he begins to ignore, until caving in and realizing that it requests him to go to a deserted warehouse to meet the one and only God (Morgan Freeman), who tells Bruce that keeping up with several pray requests and helping out so many in need is a difficult job that is often taken advantage of or under-appreciated on the grandscale. He then gives Bruce his position, equipping him with all the divine powers (IE: walking on water and possessing the ability to accurately imitate people), and the unprecedented, unearthly responsibility of keeping those in touch with their faith happy and joyous.But before we get into the sentiment, let's explore the infinite comic possibilities of Jim Carrey being God. In the relative beginning of the film, to end off of Bruce's bad day at work, he is beaten up by a group of local thugs when he attempts to protect a harmless bum. When Bruce now possesses powers, he intimidates the thugs and the one thug makes some sort of comment involving ""monkeys flying out of his butt"" and you can bet your bottom dollar Bruce makes it happen in a ridiculously unfunny scene that channels the worst comic tendencies of a PG-13 screenplay. It too doesn't help that Bruce's character is an ungrateful man of little charm and so much zaniness that he induces a headache every time his mouth opens.There's Carrey's hyperactive tendencies, and just the obligatory fact that this story practically extracts every laugh and every tear (there will be audiences, quite possibly those who are religious, but not enough to where they can't laugh at the form of satire) with a premise that basically concocts this very anemic, tired tale of redemption and ""putting yourself in the shoes of the person you criticize."" This is the third time director Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey have collaborated on a film, with the first two being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Liar Liar. Both films expressed Carrey's style with the same rabble-rousing, uncontrolled behavior this one showcases, but with more of an emphasis on humor and spontaneous enjoyment rather than heavy-handed religious satire. I also learn it took three people to pen this story, Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe, and Steve Oedekerk. One thing I could've guaranteed from the start, if I knew the writers, was a nice emotional third act, which Koren churned out to his advantage in Click but in a too little, too late fashion in A Thousand Words. Those films centered Adam Sandler and Eddie Murphy, respectively, in their madness, where this one victimizes Jim Carrey showing that he can be funny, if taken in smaller doses.Yet I can see devoted fans of Carrey's anarchic comedy embracing this film with an open mind and a willingness to laugh. There's a larger audience for this film than I can estimate, yet in the small world of satirical comedies with religion in their crosshairs, I can assume why studios aren't cranking out more of them, and I don't believe controversy is the prime reason.Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, and Philip Baker Hall. Directed by: Tom Shadyac.",Bruce Almighty
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""B-e-a-utiful!""",8,23 November 2003,"Even though I didn't think that this was the best Jim Carrey film, it's one of his better one's since ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". For a comedy, this gets it's even amount of laughs and fun for a watch with friends or family. I just loved Morgan Freeman playing God, he was just hilarious and perfect for the role, him and Jim did terrific together.Bruce is a man who isn't having much luck in life. When his girlfriend tells him just to keep faith and pray, he has his doubts and just thinks God is a phony who can't pull it together for his people. He gets a mysterious message telling him to call God, when he denies the response, God just gets his butt over to him. He tells Bruce that he's upset at his mockery of doubting his power and ability to help people. So, he decides to teach Bruce a lesson, by letting him be God for a few days and see if he can do the job. Sounds great, right? He's having better sex, better luck in traffic, better work, just a good life in general... until, he hears the prayers by other's. ""Please, let me die"" ""I want to win the lottery"" ""Please make my life better"" ""Please"" ""Please"", it goes on and on. Bruce figures to make it easy and just says ""yes"" to all the prayers, unfortunately, everyone then wins the lottery and gets job promotions leading to riots because there isn't enough. He tries to organize his prayers, but just can't do it. When he finally realizes that he can't solve everyone's problems and knows that God can't get to everyone in time.With some fun humor and a great cast, I think any Jim Carrey fan will enjoy this. It's a fun movie and just a nice drama. So, go ahead and just have a good time with the movie, who knows what more Jim Carrey has to offer? 8/10",Bruce Almighty
29,=G=,Bein' God ain't easy,7,27 November 2003,"""Bruce Almighty"" tells the story of a man who becomes God, with some restrictions, and learns that his actions have consequences and being almighty isn't as easy as he thought. Panned by the critics and a mixed bag for the man in the street, it's safe to say that if you like Jim Carrey, you'll probably like this flick. However, what most people are missing are the very positive messages about selflessness this film has to offer...something all those people who submit comments about this film might want to heed the next time they use the personal pronoun ""I"" in their commentary. Fact is, we don't care what they think. We only care what we think. So, are they thinking about us? Perhaps an occasional reminder about selflessness can be a good thing in a movie.

30,blanbrn,Funny and filled with laughs. Neat and crazy concept to become the big man upstairs!,7,20 June 2007,"Really one of the best and better movies of 2003, and maybe tying with ""Anger Mangement"" as the funniest of 2003. Jim Carrey is at his best playing Bruce Nolan who's a down on his luck Buffalo, NY television reporter who's always picked on and overlooked for promotion. About the only thing Bruce can look forward to is his main squeeze Grace(Jennifer Aniston who's just as cute and sexy as ever!)then one day things get worse when he's canned from the station, then the depression sets in. Never fear though the unexpected happens when Bruce's cell phone rings and he answers it sending him to a empty building to meet the big guy himself you guessed it God! And Morgan Freeman plays him so graceful and in a classy way, anyway Bruce is given the role of becoming God! The special powers he acquires are great, they work to his advantage it gives him pleasure and fun while messing up and hurting others. Some scenes are funny like his parody of parting tomato soup in the diner just like ""The Red Sea"", and his fishing and pulling of the moon's gravity. Finally in the end he becomes a god of love and caring by helping others and answering their needs and he finally becomes the successful reporter and lover he always wanted with help from up above. Steve Carell and Catherine Bell have cameos as news anchors. Overall as always great acting from Morgan Freeman and Jim Carrey is funny as ever in this funny and moral comedy a real winner.",Bruce Almighty
31,MovieAddict2016,Almighty Then,7,26 June 2003,"""Bruce Almighty"" is a lot like Jim Carrey's other projects. Which isn't to say it isn't funny, but it is quite recycled and doesn't pun some of the things it could and should have. Now don't get me wrong, it is anything but boring, and anything but unfunny...but it is a lot like his other projects. A funny down-on-his-luck loser (""Dumb and Dumber"") gets a supernatural power (""The Mask""), and in the end wins back the girl (""Ace Ventura"") and makes a good name for himself (""Me, Myself and Irene"").But in the same context, it is more clever and thought-provoking than his other projects. Jim Carrey plays Bruce, a generally happy, soon-to-be-married man who desperately wants to be a news reporter. Unfortunately, he ends up being fired from his job, and when this happens, he curses God. The next day his pager beeps, and Bruce calls up the number. He is given instructions on where to drive to. He follows them and ends up finding God's temporary headquarters.God is a black man (Morgan Freeman) surprisingly enough. I like Morgan Freeman, so I won't get into the racial technicalities. Anyway, God gives Bruce his powers for one week to see how well he can handle being the master of the earth, and immediately afterwards Bruce finds he has more than odd capabilities.However, much is the case with most things, Bruce finds his world also shaken by his newfound powers. He has to answer prayers, for one thing, and his relationship with Grace (Jennifer Aniston) starts to suffer due to his ever-growing greed. In the end, Bruce starts to realize it's not so easy being God.""Bruce Almighty"" is a very engaging, sweet, and harmless film, but like I said before, it is so much like Jim Carrey's other films that he seems to be making an Adam Sandler mould out of his career. One of the things I liked so much about ""Groundhog Day"" was how it showed what your average Joe would do given the power to repeat one day over and over and over again. ""Bruce Almighty"" has a very interesting and original plot, something uncommon for a comedy these days, but it unfortunately doesn't show Bruce using his newfound powers as much as he could have.But regardless, the scenes where Bruce is experimenting not only entertain you, but actually make the time fly by. I really enjoyed this movie. It isn't exactly as great as it could have been, but I don't think that was the intention. Learning from their mistakes on ""The Majestic,"" Jim Carrey (and ""Bruce Almighty's"" filmmakers) achieved their goal of making a thoroughly entertaining, if somewhat repetitive film that doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't: A Jim Carrey movie. Yes, they could have made something more interesting, dramatic, serious and hilarious, but I don't think that's what the Jim Carrey audiences want, and I think that the filmmakers are smart, in a way, for paying attention to this.4/5 stars -John Ulmer",Bruce Almighty

33,OllieSuave-007,Nobody does it better than the Almighty.,7,10 April 2014,"Discontented television reporter Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), on his worst day of his life, rages against God. He responds by appearing in human form (Morgan Freeman) and gives Bruce divine powers, challenging him to take on the big job of being the Almighty.As the divine-powered Nolan using his new gift, it is actually very hilarious to see him playing tricks on people that annoy him in his life, including the sidesplitting scene where he makes rival reporter Evan Baxter blunder big time on live TV. Makes me wish I have some special powers to counter some of the people that annoyed me to no end.The film's story also proves that it is not a walk-in-the-park to serve in God's shoes, as he has to listen to all the voices of the people's prayers around him and see what chaotic things actually happen when all people get what they wish for. I think this is cleverly depicted in this movie's solid plot.Overall, this is one of the better Jim Carrey comedies I've seen, where he is funny, but doesn't go overboard with the slapstick and silliness. Mixing in the humor with some doses of drama, you'll get quite an entertaining movie.Grade B",Bruce Almighty
34,sddavis63,A Hilarious Movie With Some Thought-Provoking Moments,8,5 June 2003,"At one point in this movie - as Bruce (Jim Carrey) gets his revenge on Evan (Steven Carell) - I was almost rolling around on the floor of the theatre in tears, the scene was so funny. That one scene alone made it worthwhile to see this movie, but having said that there's far more to this movie than one funny scene. It is a well-put together, well directed and well acted movie which is very funny and yet at the same time manages to address some very serious philosophical and theological questions along the way.The story is surprisingly (and misleadingly) simple. Bruce is always complaining that God never gives him a break, so God (played extremely well by Morgan Freeman) decides to teach him a lesson by letting Bruce play God for a while. Bruce is given two restrictions on his power: you can't fool with free will (and I'm embarrassed to admit that I can't remember the second.) For a while Bruce finds his new powers fun, but then discovers the challenges. One person's free will can impact negatively on another's, and there's nothing even God - who grants free will out of love - can do about it. When Bruce finally sets himself to the task of trying to help others rather than just amuse himself, he also discovers that saying ""yes"" to every prayer (which so many people seem to think God should do) doesn't work very well, because some people's prayers contradict others. As a clergyman, I thought these points were made well - in a humourous vein, but noting the seriousness of the issue.There were only a couple of things in the movie that didn't appeal to me. As I said, I can only remember one of the two conditions God placed on Bruce's use of His powers, but I am sure that one of them was NOT ""you have to use your power to help other people."" And yet, after Bruce amuses himself for a while, God comes to him and lectures him because he hasn't used his powers to help others. Huh? That was not one of the conditions. God became inconsistent in that moment. Also a note abut Jim Carrey: he is a very funny actor who falls into the trap of over-acting. He should let his humour flow a little more naturally. Sometimes he comes across as forced.However, this is a great movie (also featuring a good performance from Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's girlfriend Grace.)8/10",Bruce Almighty
35,cherold,unrealized potential,5,18 December 2004,"This movie really ought to have been funnier. It's not that it's a great premise - it's pretty daft, actually - but it's a workable premise. You've got Carrey with ultimate power, which offers all sorts of opportunities for humor. Yet the film rarely made it above mildly amusing and often couldn't even manage that. I think much of the problem was the movie was torn between wanting to be funny versus wanting to be touching and profound (since they throw in a scene from It's a Wonderful Life I tend to suspect they were hoping for something with that feel). The end result is a movie that fails to succeed comedically or emotionally. Bruce is not an especially sympathetic character, he's so petty and self centered that it's hard to take much of an interest in his problems or his life or his decisions. I thought Freeman made a pretty decent Lord Almighty and the bits with the dog were cute, and it wasn't so bad that I gave up on it, but it's really a movie where you just wonder, why did they even bother making this?",Bruce Almighty

38,dromasca,God as mainstream comedy item,7,7 February 2004,"I like Jim Carrey, and consider him the big comedy star of the American screen nowadays. Yes, he does remind us Jerry Lewis, but this is a tradition that goes back even farther, to the days of the mute comedy, and I do not find this a problem - quite the contrary. 'Bruce Almighty' is a(nother) comedy about God being busy, or just tired, and relenting some of his powers to earthy creatures. The lucky winner (or victim) is the very human TV reporter played by Jim Carrey, a typical mix of egocentrism and good sentiments, as any of us is. Some of the gags are really good, and the film develops well for the first two thirds of the time. No deep philosophy, but decent morality in the clothes of good comedy. Unfortunately, in the last third the movie really goes in the very center of the mainstream, trying to make happy all the family viewers in the most fundamentalist homes. This does not help the level and impression the movie makes as a whole. Jim Carrey is good as always, Jennifer Aniston prepares her post-Friends career and may catch soon the place that Meg Ryan just left free as the US cinema sweetie of the decade. My grade for this film is also 2/3 -  or 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",Bruce Almighty

As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as supporting actor/actress. The plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point. This movie can be funny(Bruce's dog) as well as sad(the ""break-up""). The script worked well, too.

It is very fun from start to finish, a very unique comedy. There really is not anything quite like it, as we follow a man who is given the powers of God. We see how someone behaves when they have unlimited possibilities. I did feel, however, that Bruce and Grace's relationship could have been developed better. There was not a whole load of arch to their love life, and we really learn nothing more about them other than they are a couple who are struggling financially, which did disappoint me. If you are a fan of Jim Carrey you will certainly enjoy it, it is the perfect vehicle for this comedic great as it gives him absolute freedom to cause mayhem, which he does best. Morgan Freeman as God is equally satisfying, his powerful demeanour suits this role perfectly and I feel it will always stand as one of his most unique performances.It's filled with memorable quotes and many big laughs, as well as a lot of heart, Bruce Almighty is a very funny movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.

This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script.

43,The-Sarkologist,What would happen if we had the power of God?,7,18 October 2013,"When this movie first came out I was really excited about it because it was one of those movies that focused on God and I thought that it would be a good movie for Christians to watch with their friends to help us spur conversations about Christinaity. However, now, ten years after this movie was first released, and having watched it now about five times, I am not so sure as to whether it really is a Christian movie. Since there are 586 reviews for this movie I will simply focus on the Christian content of this movie, and whether it is really what one would call a 'Christian movie'.To put it simply, it is not. While it does deal with the themes of the existence of God, and of God's love, as well as God's unwillingness to intrude on our free will, and also touching on the idea of why God does not necessarily answer prayers they way we want him too, I feel that the Christian element of this film is sadly lacking. The reason that I say this is because there is no mention of Christ, or even of the Trinity. Secondly there is no mention of human sin, or of our need for redemption. Rather it portrays our spiritual reality in a form in which there is really only God (and yes, he is a God of love) and Christiaity is not the only monotheistic religion with a loving God. In fact, I feel that what this movie is simply doing is merging the Christian and Jewish faiths, and is probably more Jewish than it is Christian.The interesting question that is raised in this film is the question of what one would do if one woke up one morning with the power of God. I think the film answers this question brilliantly in that one would probably do things that simply served one's own purposes. We see this happen almost right from the beginning where Bruce gives himself a Ferarri, teaches his dog to use the toilet, sets himself up as 'Mr Exclusive' and then sets the rival TV network up for smuggling drugs. Further, he decides that he thinks that it would be better if God answered all his prayers with 'yes' only to discover that chaos results.However Bruce does come to understand that with great power comes great responsibility, and it is a responsibility that he does not feel that he can handle. For instance, he pulls the moon closer to the Earth so that he might have a romantic evening with his defacto wife, only to discover that this causes a tidal wave in Japan. He also causes a meteor to strike so that he might capture the story, only to discover that it results in constant black outs. He also ends up setting up his rival, and snaring the coveted anchor position, only to discover that he does not want it. Finally, even with all of his power, he cannot change his defacto's heart after she walks out on him.I suspect that many of us out there would love to have the power of God, and would think that if we did then we would use it to make the world a better place. However what we do not have is God's wisdom, nor the desire to really make the world a better place. To many of us in the post-modern world, the whole concept of 'the world as a better place' really only focuses on our own particular world. Especially here in the wealthy and industrialised west, we don't actually see that what we have is actually pretty good – we actually want more. We see this with Bruce at the beginning, where he does have a good life, and wealth, but he is not satisfied with what he has, and it is only after he loses what he really wants, that he ends up learning that what he had was all that he really needed.",Bruce Almighty

46,johnnyboyz,With great power comes great responsibility.,6,3 January 2008,"If Tears for Fears' 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' hadn't already been used in Adam Sandler's 2006's comedy 'Click'; then I might have been forever associating that piece of music to this; Bruce Almighty, which apart from being one of lead actor Jim Carrey's best films; also doubles up as director Tom Shadyac's best from what I've seen. Bruce Almighty is a film with a heart; with a true heart. Its idea is that of one where the hero, who is of course down and out, would get the opportunity to play God but it isn't a film that merely gives Carrey an excuse to act stupid in a manner that may have anyone under the age of sixteen laughing but the rest of us cringing; oh no, it's something a little more than that.From very early on, it would seem both Carrey and Shadyac are harking back to their old ways. There is a massive billboard advertising Bruce Nolan (Carrey) half way through the film which is a promotional photo from Liar, Liar from what I've read; Bruce also references Ace Ventura with the 'Hi-Ho Away Silver!' quote and you could well change 'allrighty-then!' into 'Almighty-then!' But there are deeper things than that. The set up revolves around one man and his tragedy in a way reminiscent to 1994 Carrey master class The Mask and like The Mask, Carrey's character is given superhuman powers which enables him to turn his life around from zero to hero as well as help out other people now and again. But whilst The Mask was a little lagging in its narrative what with its clichéd mobsters and so forth, Bruce Almighty makes up for in heart and realism. At a time when so many big budget films are being made and distributed, it is great to see a film like this not take advantage of its budget. The film's idea of God is not a spectacular vision of light, CGI effects and so forth but in the form of Morgan Freeman; himself chipping in with references to his previous work: ""You'll need room se7en on the se7enth floor"" he quips. Heaven as a filmic space is fascinating to look into and parallels with Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure spring to mind but the film's idea of heaven is not this vast, expansive space with people entering all the time but this tiny office floor inhabited by nothing and nobody bar Nolan and God himself.It would seem strange of me to say so, but the film acts better as a character study of one man; not a comedy. It's now apparent that Carrey can play the serious role what with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but here, he is breaking through into that 'serious' mould by taking on a subject matter and certain characters in their own psychological jeopardy whilst mastering basic one-liner comedy and giving us a performance; this is why you could argue that this is Carrey's best film over the likes of The Cable Guy and the Ace Ventura films: he begins one person, progresses and finishes someone else. The Mask did this on a basic level but much of that was on a far, far higher comic level. Another subject the film tackles with relative ease is the topic of God himself. Whilst maintaining the perhaps outdated theory that God is both male and inhabits a white beard; people will be quick to point out God is indeed black. Some interesting points arise here; namely the fact we have to assume Freeman is playing the Christian God and not Allah; a Roman God or anything else. Secondly, notice how things such as the slave trade in centuries gone by have perhaps been overlooked: if God really is black, how does he justify how black people have been portrayed and used throughout history? It's interesting to note that the gang of thugs featured were of the Hispanic variety but whether what has anything to do with anything remains too ambiguous to comment on; as do the multiple theories behind casting Morgan Freeman.Due to my feelings on having this film labelled a comedy; which I feel is wrong, I think it fails at certain times when it tires to be funny. Carrey is of course his usual smart, fast and quirky self who cracks a couple of jokes and attempts to make us laugh but how much of it was scripted? Did Carrey make a few additions in the process? Because it isn't as hilarious as it would've been had actual writers spent time to come up with material. Consequently, the scripted humour comes in the form of Nolan and Grace's (Aniston) pet dog constantly peeing on the furniture as they pick him up and carry him outside: genitalia and urine in clear view  not funny. Also, Nolan's telepathic foreplay with Grace through the walls gives us a crude inside look of what it's like to make love as a 'God' but it isn't funny and feels very out of place in the film as it acts as an excuse to produce meek, juvenile laughs  as does the urinating dog re-occurring joke.I think that with humour aside, Bruce Almighty works as an inventive and challenging film with a heart at is centre built on a great premise. The humour in the form of Bruce using his powers to win Grace back after certain events was weak as was the way the film stopped for that entire segment. But the film has some fantastic ideas and some interesting moments that have you laughing at the inventiveness rather than the jokes. A clever and thought provoking film but don't expect to laugh too much.",Bruce Almighty
47,filipemanuelneto,"Constructive, positive and fun.",8,23 November 2016,"This is one of the most iconic comedies of the turn of the century, and it's probably Jim Carrey's most notable work, along with ""Lyar Lyar"" and ""Ace Ventura"". The movie revolves around Bruce, an ordinary man who suddenly receives from God all the divine powers while the Creator himself is allegedly on vacation. It could only end in a great mess. Jim Carrey was at his best, and is truly the pillar of the film, with jokes of all kinds and for all tastes. I think his comic vein has had a great influence in the direction of the script, and I do not rule out the hypothesis that some of the jokes have come out on the spur of the moment. Veteran Morgan Freeman has played God, and it's delightful to see the laid-back, positive way he looks at Carrey with a great sense of humor. Both are great actors, but the truth is that we are so used to seeing Freeman in action movies or ""Seven"", just to give an example) that we are very pleasantly surprised whenever we see the actor in a more relaxed, As is the case with this film. The story, the script itself, is very good. It's that kind of movie that seeks to convey a positive message to you while it makes you laugh. It talks about how we can have a positive attitude towards the problems of our life, and that usually what comes easy is easily lost.Good movies with uplifting and truly human messages are increasingly a rarity nowadays. Therefore, I commend the work developed in this film, which educates besides amusing the whole family.",Bruce Almighty
48,Petey-10,What if God was Jim Carrey?,9,30 November 2006,"Jim Carrey plays a Newsanchor called Bruce Nolan.Bruce has lots of complaints in life, even though his girlfriend is the beautiful Grace Connelly, who looks a lot like Jennifer Aniston.Bruce blames God pretty often for his mishaps so one day God appears in the form of Morgan Freeman.God gives Bruce the opportunity to replace him while he takes a vacation he has so desired.It's not easy being God, Bruce soon realizes.People with their prayers and all.Tom Shadyac's Bruce Almighty (2003) is mighty funny comedy.There's Jim Carrey to make sure we won't watch this movie with a straight face.Then there's also Steve Carell playing an other Newsanchor called Evan Baxter.He's not any less funny than Carrey.Morgan Freeman makes a terrific God.Jennifer Aniston was great in Friends as Rachel Greene and so she is in this movie.Of course because of that show Jen has been type-casted a lot and her character here isn't too far from the character she played in Friends.Philip Baker Hall is great as always playing Jack Baylor.Catherine Bell is brilliant as Susan Ortega.And so is Lisa Ann Walter as Debbie.Nora Dunn is Ally Loman and Sally Kirkland is Anita Mann.They're both great.There's Tony Bennett singing his sweet melodies.What else do you need for a movie? You can't fail with these people.I'm not saying Bruce Almighty is a masterpiece, not at all.But it is highly entertaining, and most importantly it made me laugh.It's awfully funny watching Jim Carrey using his powers.One time he makes Steve Carell look like a total fool live on TV.They're both terrific comedians who have been blessed with the ability to make people laugh.They say there's going to be a sequel for this next year called Evan Almighty with Steve in the lead.We'll see what's that going to be like.This may not be the most critically acclaimed movie but I acclaim it.And I praise the Lord for giving us Bruce Almighty.",Bruce Almighty
49,leplatypus,"For one time, Devil is missed (TV)",4,13 March 2007,"This movie is about an unlucky loser (Jim Carrey) who blames God for his fate. As a try-out, God gives him his almighty powers for a while. This new god turns his love, his life, his town totally upside down to finally understand what he has to doI admit: this was the movie teaser that motivates me to see the movie. But I was a bit afraid that the good jokes of the teaser could have been ""the best of"". But, surprisingly, the period while Bruce is almighty is the less interesting part of the movie: the jokes are fun but his ambition & egocentrism bite the nail of the enjoyment. In other words, the script lacks here some deep sense. On the opposite, the beginning of his unsuccessful life & his final revelation are more balanced: the jokes are hilarious & I care for his fighting spirit! It was all the more enjoyable than i got the feeling of ""déjà-vu"": Believe it or not, last year, on 1st June, St Justin day (!), after a f#ck! day (shootings from my boss, a dear friend hangs up at phone), I came back to my accommodation, saying the same lines of that movie: ""what do you want God ?"" ""when did I act so badly to feel such pain!!!"" Then, opening my letterbox, I find a printed ad: ""You want help! Ready to help!"". Again like the movie. I didn't phoned the office, just keep the letter as a fetish luck.Lately, my fate get worst but, with the help of a great collaborator, I had a revelation & make sense: bad luck, worries aren't the work of God but the work of the devil. If you believe in God, you can't ignore the devil. So my opinion is the more you stay sincere, honest, honorable, helpful, the more you signal to the bad one. You become then a first in his list of harassment. Life is thus balanced: what God gives you, Devil tries to take it back.The sign that this is a good path for thinking is that my belief (Zen) translates this also: Life changes: Be ready for that!!! So, in spite of all the good fun, this comedy is unable to propose an active thinking. Its almigthy flaw is the side of bad things When Bruce becomes crazy or when people riots, if god is sad, the other one should have a good laugh, because all the pure things (love, compassion) have left Maybe this more profound vision in the sequel.. In all cases, Jim Carrey is an enthusiastic actor. His energy is a great help to clearly understand how the character feel: When he is confused, he is madly furious; when he miss his girlfriend, he really seems pitifulMy conclusion would be from Pope Benoit XVI, who answers the question: ""Has God the sense of fun?"" with: ""Absolutely, but he is very subtle, the signs hard to appear, but when the pieces come together, it is a way to return for more humility!!!""",Bruce Almighty
50,helpless_dancer,Carrey does it again,8,19 June 2004,"Well, was Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns? This film sure was better than that bore, ""Oh, God"". I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. I, for one, don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I was rolling over this one. Well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best.",Bruce Almighty
51,Anonymous_Maxine,"Wait, you mean all I have to do is become God to solve all my problems? Why didn't I think of that before???",9,9 July 2003,"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that  things like that shouldn't be ignored. I'm reminded of the episode of Michael Moore's brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere (a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film). Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie. He's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague. You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freeman's massive talent as an actor. He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers (as well as the viewers of this movie) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life. I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. There are a lot of people in the world (maybe more than our share in America) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion. I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live. But despite the fact that I don't believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come. If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura (both of which I loved, by the way) or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it's amazing how far he's come. He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic (easily one of his greatest films ever). Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie (as she did in the side-splitting Office Space) as Bruce's girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him. There is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura's friend Spike make a cameo appearance. As Stephen King very well knows, it's always nice to see familiar characters. It's almost like seeing family again.
Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him. The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers. The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.
The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene (who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records), the scene where Bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking. The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God (who reveals that he's the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc) that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home! I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law.
Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection. It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie (which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy), it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. Don't miss this one.",Bruce Almighty
52,Vartiainen,Good humour and a good moral,8,29 June 2017,"In one of Jim Carrey's best films he plays Bruce Nolan, a news reporter that nurses hopes of one day becoming an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor.In all seriousness though, this is a good comedy. It mixes Carrey's usual facial antics and high energy with good special effects and gags that actually make sense within the story. The story of course going that this everyday guy gets powers from God (Morgan Freeman) himself. He promptly uses these powers to improve his own life, ruin the career of his competitor and make his girlfriend's breasts bigger. Because that's what we all would do, whether we admit it or not.And therein lies the beauty of this film. It actually has a good message to deliver. And this all culminates in Morgan Freeman as The Big Kahuna himself. Fantastic, heartfelt role and a message that goes unsaid too often. Because it isn't enough that you wish for something to happen. You need to go out and be part of the solution. Don't just wish for a miracle, be the miracle.Is this film a bit clunky? Yeah. Is it immature? Oh yes. But it's also funny, surprisingly thoughtful and has its heart in the right place. Can you really ask for more?",Bruce Almighty
53,taylorkingston,A great movie...,10,15 April 2015,"This movie is really just awesome. It's so good. It's funny, obvious it should be, as it's a comedy, and it's not over the top. It has great, serious moments, but you love the comedic ones more, which you should. I'm going to say that if you don't like comedies, you will not like this movie. And if you don't like comedies, why are you wasting your time watching one? This movie is about a man named Bruce, who is TV reporter in Buffalo, New York. He is disconnected with almost everything in life. Even though he is very popular and has a girlfriend, Grace, who really loves him. Bruce has the worst day of his entire life and at the end of it, he gets really mad at God. Saying very bad things in the heat of the moment. Unexpectedly, except to anyone who saw the trailer, God responds to Bruce and gives him the power and responsibilities of God. He challenges Bruce to take on the job and try to make everyone happy. Which we all know is impossible. Bruce accepts and does his very best, but he's just not cut out for being God. Favorite Part Of The Movie: When Bruce is figuring out how to get all of the prayers and read them all. He makes the come up in many different forms, such as letters and Post-Its. Then he does them in emails, which works way better. And he tries to grant everyone's prayers, but it just doesn't work. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Bruce Almighty

Bruce Nolan(Carrey) is a reporter for a news-team in Buffalo, New York who seems to be anything but happy. You got a job, you should be happy. Not Bruce! He gripes and groans at everything, including to God(Morgan Freeman). So when God talks to him, he gets the message, GOOD!! He gives Bruce his powers, and he does total mischief at first: Making the fire hydrant blow, blows the woman dress up, takes care of the gang which wasn't bad. And the one that busted up my insides, is where he makes his rival, Evan Baxter(Steve Carrell) look like a total idiot on live TV! It took me a while recover from that. Other than that, it's a very awesome movie. Great cast, great plot, great storyline. This movie will leave you in stitches all the way. Lisa Ann Walter killed me on ""Pyramid"", that's another story though. Look up, and watch ""Bruce Almighty"" 5 stars!",Bruce Almighty
56,FiendishDramaturgy,Beats you over the head with dogmatic religious ramblings.,3,27 November 2003,"Carrey vs. Stewart. Is this an attempt at a modernized remake of ""It's A Wonderful Life?""Bruce is a schmuck reporter who has blown every chance he's ever had, until he finally cracks and starts yelling at his deity of choice to do a better job. Since he feels he's got a good bead on what ""god"" should do to make things better, he is given the chance to do it for himself.I found this movie to be entertaining...if you are of mainstreamchristianity. If you are not, then it will be a colossal waste of your time as most of the movie shows what NOT to do with supposed God-like powers, and the remainder shows what you should ... again, from a mainstreamchristian standpoint.There IS however, a very strong ""New Age-y"" message in the theme of this movie, in spite of the obvious proselytization; to look to yourself for your own miracles.Other than that, if you are not mainstreamchristian, I suggest you absquatulate to the action section of your video rental store and pick up Laura Croft: Tomb Raider 2; the Cradle of Life. It is far superior to the first installment, and a fun adventure.Or...X-MEN United (X2). Again, better than the original, which was not a bad endeavor to begin with. The sequel gives you much more character development and a much better adventure than the first. There are a few new additions to the Mutant fold, as well. So have fun, and avoid this almost-reverent look at neochristianity at all costs. However...if you are of that persuasion, then you'll either love it or hate it. It promotes prayer, piety, and attempts to generate pity for an overworked, under-appreciated deity. It didn't work for me, but it may work for you.I would have rather rearranged my garage, frankly.If you are a die-hard Carrey fan, it rates a 6.7/10 for Carrey's great performance.If you are nonchristian, it rates a 2.1/10 only because Carrey IS good in this movie, but the content is 100% christianoriented and is an impudent promotion of those religious theologies.If you are a comedy fan, it rates a 3.2/10 for a couple of good laughs (don't miss Carrey's parting of the ""Red Sea."")If you are of the ranks of neochristianity, it rates a 7.2/10 for shameless monotheistic proselytization.As a whole, it rates a 3.1/10 from... the Fiend :.",Bruce Almighty

Mr M.Freeman isn't quite as cool as Mr S.L.Jackson but he's cool enough to steal this movie from under the nose of Mr J.Carrey quite effortlessly.Miss J.Aniston - game as a young Debbie Reynolds - plays Lois Lane to Carrey's Superman(for what is God but Superman after all?)and is - in my opinion - a far better actress than she is given credit for.She radiates intensity and determination and it is not her fault that she is required to replicate Miss M.Ryan in a totally unnecessary and faintly embarrassing sequence where our Jim tests out his supreme power in a predictable manner. ""Bruce Almighty"" does not travel well.Mr Carrey is an acquired taste. When he demands of Miss Aniston ""Love me,love me,love me"" he is echoing the command many American comedians issue peremptorily to their audience ,one which does not settle too well with the more delicate stomach of the average Brit.

So I watched it and to my complete surprise actually enjoyed the show. This movie had humor, a good story, solid acting and and overall endearing quality lacking in most, or more accurately practically all movies churned out of the Hollywood movie-making machine. Jim Carrey was actually FUNNY and Jennifer Anniston was wonderful. Morgan Freeman was commanding and Steve Carell was funny too. The scenes with Mr. Carrey and Mr. Freeman were really excellent, well scripted and well acted, making for a compelling movie worthy of positive attention. There might be some who may object to the movie's portrayal of God, but those objections notwithstanding, it's a respectful portrayal and one which helps the audience to better appreciate the pitfalls as well as the benefits of divine power.

But too many people seemed to have missed the message.,10,6 December 2003,"OK, it's clear that ""Bruce Almighty"" has stirred up quite a storm of controversy apparently on all fronts for its views of religion (I've read it's been banned in several countries) and the fact that the powers of God can be trusted upon an average joe, who is in this case, Bruce Nolan (played by Jim Carrey).  I have no beef against ""Bruce Almighty"" because I feel that anyone can relate to Bruce's situation, and I think that is what a lot of this movie's attackers have missed.  Yes this is a comedy, but it has a heart and it's in the right place.  As for the storm, however, the question of whether or not this movie is truly blasphemous in any kind of way, I'll leave to the scholars but don't look past the message that this movie is trying to convey to the audience. It simply tells a story that you should love yourself for who you are and that God (or some force higher than Man) has a plan for you and don't think that you are insignificant.  God (or a higher force) always answers, but the answer you receive may not always be the one that you desire.

61,meeza,Almighty Carrey!,8,26 May 2003,"`Bruce Almighty' will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass `Titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would possess the powers of God. That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carrey's new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty'. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the `Gift of God'(his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do God's job any better. Obviously, Bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not `mis.pittiful' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty' is not the most in-depth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `Carreyism'! **** Good",Bruce Almighty
62,GiraffeDoor,It's not god awful but it's not divinely inspired either.,7,23 June 2019,Very crude and rather stupid comedy that thinks it can get away with trashy humour because it pours on the sentimentality.And it sort of does.

63,Chris_Docker,Carrey on form,7,27 June 2003,"Now either you like Mr Carrey's humour or you don't. Me, Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film. If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie.Carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot. God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey gets into the swing of having all of God's powers by making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston)'s breasts bigger, getting himself promoted, and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands.This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders.On the more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes. His most accomplished 'straight' role, the Man on the Moon, is less well known that his comedy romps - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey).",Bruce Almighty

When Bruce (Jim Carrey) was taunted, I felt really touched. It's hard for me to explain why. Still, he was very funny. If you ask me, he was just as funny as God was. One of the funniest things about this film was Bruce singing ""One Of Us."" In case you're wondering, that song is performed by Joan Osborne. Grace (Jennifer Aniston) was funny, too, especially when she asked Bruce if her b****** looked bigger. I felt a little weird, though.

And then there's Jennifer Aniston, she was OK, I am an Aniston fan, but it's kinda hard to be a big fan of her in Bruce almighty, because like freeman, there just isn't much to her performance in the film. Also this movie is just hopelessly UNfunny, I mean I didn't even chuckle once during the entire film, and let me just tell ya, the movie is too long, the runtime is just simply too long. The movie should've been funnier, much funnier, especially since it stars comedic talent Jim Carrey, go figure. Bruce Almighty stoops to childish mediocre stunts to gain laughs, but fails miserably at it. Steve Carrel, another comedic talent, is in the movie, but he is a flop here as well.

An overall good comedy for Jim Carey, it is funny for both a child and an adult audience. The only complaint I have about the film, other than it was not shot entirely in Buffalo, is that the studios marketed the film as a Jim Carey comedy. Even though it was the only smart choice to make, Jim Carey being a giant comedy star, the film is not your typical Jim Carey ""make them laugh"" movie. Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman are terrific and make the film stands up on its alone without Jim Carey. Much like Liar Liar, audience members may have passed on this film thinking it was a typical Jim Carey film. In fact, Bruce Almighty is one of Jim Carey's better films with a good story and great cast of characters.",Bruce Almighty
69,Agent10,"Brings up some interesting questions, and is funny too!",7,24 May 2003,"Sure, Jim Carrey nearly ruined his career with The Majestic, but he returns to form with this great comedy. It also posed the inevitable question: What if Jim Carrey was God? This should have been a horror film, but that's for another movie. Nonetheless. Carrey's inexorable physical humor made this film what is is, a sweet little comedy that doesn't get too preachy. While I wanted more to happen in the last 15 minutes of the film, one can't complain about the rest of the film. To say the least, it was pure comic genius, and for all of the religious nutbags who claim this film is sacreligious should lighten up. This is nothing more than a popcorn movie with enough great visuals and plot to keep you entertained.",Bruce Almighty
70,questl-18592,Oh God,7,29 December 2020,"This movie really came out at the perfect time to win me over. Back in the glory days of '03 I was still pretty darn religious and I grew up loving the rubber faced antics of Carrey so this movie had my number from the get go. Now, almost 20 yea- Good lord, it's been almost 20 years. Anyhow, watching it now I still find it pretty funny. Carrey is great and he's surrounded by a serious cast of talented people. Where this one has waned for me is in the serious moments. It's gets a little too dramatic, a little too religious at points and watching it now, it feels awkward.Still, solid comedy with some really great bits and quotable material that I have used since it came out. Solid recommend here. Worth a rent at least if you're not sure but if you're a fan of anyone in the cast list then I'd say it's worth buying.",Bruce Almighty
71,triple8,"As good as I expected it to be, maybe even better.",9,28 August 2003,"Some people might Think I'm crazy for giving this a 9 of 10, but I thought it was great as both a comedy and a sweet, involving story.I had seen the previews for this and couldn't wait to see the movie. I was afraid that the movie wouldn't live up to the previews(something that happens QUITE frequently in movie land.) Boy was I wrong!This was very enjoyable from start to finish. The movie is very moving and funny and also manages to make a quiet statement about not taking what you have in life for granted and being happy with yourself and your choices.Some people may consider Bruce Almighty corny but I thought it was done very well and managed to make it's point without coming across as preachy.What also surprised me was how much I enjoyed Jim Carey's performance. I had seen some of his other work and couldn't say I was very impressed but he was very good in this. Maybe it's because, for the first time I felt rather then just being very in your face funny he was actually ACTING-and he proved himself to be a pretty good actor. Anniston to did a surprisingly sweet performance as Bruce's girlfriend and Morgan was PEREFECTLY cast as God.This was a movie that had me laughing SO hard but crying too-beautifully done without being at all overdone Bruce Almighty is a perfect movie choice. 9 of 10.",Bruce Almighty

73,rosscinema,Film squanders Carrey's talent,4,28 June 2003,"Jim Carrey is a very talented actor and he has done some amazing things on camera in other films but this script never allows him to showcase his abilities. The story is about a television news reporter in Buffalo named Bruce Nolan (Carrey) who wants to get the anchor job at his station but is instead given jobs like covering the worlds largest cookie or interviewing someone at Niagara Falls. He feels that his life is not going the way he expected and after several bad luck incidents he is blaming God for ignoring his needs. He lives with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) and she dreams of marrying Bruce. Bruce keeps getting paged and finally he calls the number that tells him to go to an address. He goes and meets God (Morgan Freeman) who tells him he is sick of Bruce blaming him for his problems so he is being given all his powers while he goes on vacation. Bruce and his new found powers go out and try to fix some of the things in his life. He teaches his dog to use the toilet and he also gives Grace bigger breasts. He also uses the powers for some unexpected happenings when he is reporting like a comet coming to Earth or discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body! Bruce tries to make everyone happy (Especially himself) but loses Grace when she see's Bruce's co-worker Susan (Catherine Bell) kiss him at a party. The films story should have given Carrey all sorts of opportunities to use his natural comedic gifts but unfortunately it does not. Instead, the script only gives him opportunities to react to humorous situations going on around him. The story is simple and silly but thats okay. The story of ""Liar,Liar"" was silly also but that script gave Carrey the chance to show some of his best physical comedy put on film! This script wastes the enormous talent that it had to embody the story. This film does have some genuine laughs in it like when Bruce uses his power to make the news anchor sputter gibberish on the air or when he turns on Grace before a night of lovemaking. Only in a few moments do we see Carrey's real talent and the one scene that stands out is when he does his Clint Eastwood impersonation while in his car. Thats Carrey using his natural gifts but these are only fleeting moments. I wasn't a fan of the ""Ace Ventura"" films but they did one thing right. They allowed Carrey to explode with his natural comedic talent. This film doesn't do that. Instead, the script harness's Carrey and all he has to do is react to the situations at hand. Film does deliver some real laughs but the rest of the time I was waiting to see if Carrey could emerge from the contrived story. Unfortunately, he does not!",Bruce Almighty
74,invisibleunicornninja,Could've been good.,4,10 January 2019,"Honestly this story really could've worked if it wasn't focused on appealing to the lowest common denominator. The humor is all cringy and impossibly juvenile. Half the jokes barely make sense. Also the protagonist is insanely unlikable. If there was a better script, and there was more of a coherent story then this could've been something great.",Bruce Almighty
75,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A fun Carrey romp with a decent message,7,3 January 2019,"Believing in a higher power isn't always people like to think. To some it sounds corny, others it seems useless, while others actually feel it does them a world of good. No matter what religion you have or don't have, life has a way of working itself out. How people deal with this though depends on the personality. Some feel they're doomed to suffer bad luck constantly, while others think if they pray, it'll change their directional course. When in fact, there's more to take away from this kind of situation and what better way to explore this with a little Jim Carrey team up with Tom Shadyac. Surprisingly unlike his other features, Shadyac produces a feature a slight bit different in tone, however it still works in favor for the audience. It actually is quite thought provoking.Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), a news reporter looking to do more than just cover fluff pieces is frustrated with how things are going. While his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) thinks things are adequate, she doesn't see that Nolan's adversary Evan Baxter (Steve Carrell) keeps getting more and more promotions. Finally having enough, Bruce comes in contact with the one and only God (Morgan Freeman) and gives him a taste of his power to help take care of business ; since Bruce thinks God isn't doing anything right. Written by Steve Koren (Seinfeld) and Mark O'Keefe (The Weird Al Show), the script to this feature brings on a narrative that's funny and may actually have the viewer realize something about themselves when the end credits roll. That's pretty good for a Jim Carrey film.Seeing Bruce Nolan go through the expected emotions of attaining god-like powers is funny. When gaining that kind of ability, of course one will take matters into their own hands and right their own wrongs first. But of course having such incredible powers, comes great responsibility as cliche as that sounds. But it's true and the writers help put that into perspective not only for Nolan but the viewers themselves. There's only one major plot hole that came about that didn't make much sense. When God gives Nolan his powers, he says no to do two things. First, not to tell anyone and two, that he cannot affect free will. Yet somehow, Nolan can make his dog do things for him. So is it just human free will he can't control? If not, then he lied because a dog is a living being too, just not as sophisticated as a human.The actors are no doubt comical in their roles. Jim Carrey makes plenty of funnies throughout using his usual brand of humor. While Jennifer Aniston is nowhere on the comedic level as Carrey, she has some very deadpan moments that help ground the situations that ensue. The same could also be said for Morgan Freeman who stares down Carrey's character with truth and honesty in every word that he says. Even Carrell who has a much smaller role, gets his moments to do some crazy things. There's also appearances from Philip Baker Hall as Nolan's boss, Catherine Bell as a co-anchor of the news company Nolan works for and Lisa Ann Walter as Grace's sister, who also talks some sense to Nolan. Considering this is coming from director Tom Shadyac, who made Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), it's a surprise change in execution.When it came to visuals, things were pretty good for 2003. The tricks used to make things look believable do not look put together last second. Things like added hand digits or walking on water all looks very well done. However, one thing element that doesn't look anything special is the cinematography. Which is odd because it was shot by Dean Semler, the cinematographer to The Road Warrior (1981), City Slickers (1991), The Three Musketeers (1994), We Were Soldiers (2002) and later on Maleficent (2014). The shots of the city and other streets are just boring and lack anything that stands out. However the film score provided by John Debney did a wonderful job. The music is light and energetic, just like the main lead and the antics that come about. Not anything shy of what he's done before.While there's one noticeable plot hole and the cinematography isn't anything to be impressed with, the rest is a fun feature. The actors all give entertaining performances, the comedy is funny and the writing behind it not only gives some good laughs, but also has a message about taking on life and what do to about it.",Bruce Almighty
76,Rob_Taylor,Harmless fun,7,2 June 2003,"Jim Carrey has shown in the past that he can do serious comedy (The Truman Show), and he can do whacked-out comedy (The Mask). I get the feeling he wasn't sure quite how to play this one, and as a result his character comes across as a little schizophrenic, jumping from the aforementioned Truman to Ace Ventura at the drop of a hat. However the farcical comedy is kept to a minimum and this works to the movie's benefit.I didn't find it hilarious, but it was an enjoyable, fun film to watch. Not one of Carrey's best, but not a stinker either. Morgan Freeman gave a most restrained (I suppose dignified is a better word) performance as God and Jennifer Aniston wasn't too bad as Carrey's love interest.Not destined to be a blockbuster (but then, some blockbusters shouldn't be, in my opinion) but a solid enough film and a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.",Bruce Almighty

Jennifer Aniston is an underrated actress. Morgan Freeman gives a great performance playing God, himself. He has some of the greatest lines in this films.This film is funny. Very enjoyable. One of the great things about the film is that it gives an important message. Individuals, like you, can improve their life. This film is not very religious.

Does anybody still laugh at him? That man is a parody of himself and has been so for years.

80,uds3,Presumably God bequeathed us HIS sense of humor. I doubt this tickled his fancy!,5,5 July 2003,"Ok guys, I too am a Jim Carrey fan from way back....but MAN, he and Shadyac are completely off the rails with this mess!The first 30 minutes are fine.....vintage Carrey and right up until the Niagara Falls sequence - brilliant. Can't fault the acting, direction, script or general entertainment quotient. Somewhere just beyond the half-way point however..perhaps around the advent of the moon-roping sequence, the film  starts to disintegrate. The makers, obviously using LIAR LIAR as a template, find they haven't the story or depth to sustain what is basically a one-joke film. The fault is not Carrey's in fact he sustains a high level of acting throughout..even when the film is irredeemably lost by the three-quarter mark! Incredibly...BRUCE ALMIGHTY enters into a phase of utter BOREDOM as we are treated to a pseudo-religious sermon that just refuses to kerb its pretension.One fault - for me at least - was the casting of Jennifer Anniston. Whereas Maura Tierney made such a smart, attractive and cute feminine lead/wife in LIAR LIAR, Ms Anniston looks like a really middle-aged if not totally bedraggled love interest for most of the time..she does absolutely nothing for the picture. The ""highlight"" of the movie...the ""newsreading sequence"" WAS funny admittedly but would even have been more amusing had not Rowan Atkinson done it way better and funnier in JOHNNY ENGLISH.The last thirty minutes plays out like some out-takes from THE MAJESTIC which also found itself with nowhere to go at a critical point. In summation therefore, I have to agree with so many others who rightly commented that the film could have been soo much better given the premise and yeah...if you've seen the trailer...don't bother with the film!",Bruce Almighty

Or the fact that Morgan Freeman is playing God. I don't know, but it was really funny and enjoyable. It is a film that shows us that we don't need a sequel sometimes. Like with most movies, beside Kill Bill and a few others. Evan almighty was just a silly film that was far from Jim Carrey's film and not very funny. Bruce almighty has humor that everyone can laugh at, while Evan almighty had humor that only children could laugh at. Did I think that Bruce Almighty was Jim Carrey's funniest? Not quite, but it was a pretty funny film. Thumbs up for Bruce almighty. I didn't think it was his best, though i've liked every film he was in. Besides Rubberface, but we'll let him go on that piece of sh*t. Jim Carrey is my favorite actor and I will be sure to see everything he is in. In the near future anyways. I think that Bruce Almighty has a bit of a heart and deserves a lot of credit. There are many good performances in this film, by Jennifer Aniston, who I love, Jim Carrey, and Morgan Freeman, who we know will be fantastic in everything he is in, so I didn't even have to mention that one.

86,RNMorton,Pop religion takes a hit,5,11 April 2005,"The idea of Morgan Freeman being God and loaning Jim Carrey his powers is such a neat idea. But I guess making an entertaining movie about it is harder than it looks, kind of like being The Almighty. There's about enough good scenes for an attractive trailer (which this movie happened to have). Beyond that and a couple of funny jokes from Morgan you're on your own. For the most part Jim uses his new powers to help his ""romantic life"" and get ahead in the local news grind by playing cruel practical jokes on his competition. No fun there. So they squander some great comedic opportunities and deal out lousy ersatz religion all at the same time. I would get more upset about inappropriate and bad religious movies like this and Michael, 'cept they're so bad in their own right there's little danger of anyone taking them too seriously. Maybe God is more active than some people think. At least a Friend-less Aniston (the way we like her) rises marginally above the material.

It does get better.  And in some cases you might end up tearing up.  Although clearly The Truman Show is Carrey's best, this isn't too bad.  But the director in charge overshot the movie.  So it's a bit choppy.  Skips around.  Many of these details come out by watching the 30 minutes of deleted scenes.  Some I thought should have been kept in.  But many never should have been shot.  So the director stunk as far as overshooting the movie.  The editor stunk because he took too much out.And the sexual overtones knock this movie way down, because it could have been a decent family movie.  Aniston is probably better here than Along Came Polly, but having dialogues like.  Hey are my boobs bigger?  And guys praying for their schlong to get bigger.  Just too many innuendo to suit me. That is... for a family movie.  I'm surprised this movie wasn't rated R. The amount of language in here is astonishing... for pg -13It sure is a laugh.

The film does have some funny moments but a lot of the jokes are best seen in the trailer.  Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective direction is good as always and Shadyac knows the comedy genre very well. But it seems like in the editing the decided to go back and make the film a little kid friendly.

I've been rewatching this for some time, but can say that although it may seem bit unreal for todays age and older population who know difference between fake and real, I can say it is ideal for bit younger population and religious people interested in God. The age I watched it for the first time. Emotional and human. Also Morgan Freeman has that specific godly look which made him maybe the most interesting actor here. And Jennifer is for emotions.

90,hall895,God is a funny guy,7,6 August 2014,"Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck Buffalo TV reporter for whom things just never seem to go right. Soon after we meet him Bruce is passed over for the big promotion to the anchor desk. He reacts...poorly. And gets himself fired. Who does Bruce blame for this latest misfortune? God. Well, God isn't going to take that lying down. God summons Bruce to an empty warehouse. Hey, if you're God where else would you rather hang out than an empty warehouse in Buffalo? Anyhow Bruce doesn't particularly believe the strange man he meets in the warehouse is God. But God has his ways of convincing Bruce. Turns out God is a bit of a showoff when it comes to using his powers. And now he is going to give those powers to Bruce. If Bruce thought God was doing a bad job well here's his chance to prove he can do it better.So being given all of God's powers seems like a pretty good deal. And Bruce wastes no time putting those powers to good use. He is able to impress his girlfriend in all sorts of ways. He's able to sabotage his rival and get that anchor job he so coveted. He's even able to get his dog to stop peeing on the furniture. All well and good but all these things he's doing are just for his own personal benefit. When you're God you have to look out for everyone. There are a lot of prayers out there waiting to be answered. Bruce is more than a tad overwhelmed and inevitably he makes a mess of things. And that mess extends to his personal life. Issues with the girlfriend arise. Well that's easy to solve when you're God, just snap your fingers and make her love you again right? Nope, not even God can mess with free will. Turns out being God is no fun if you've lost the love of your life.As with any Jim Carrey comedy there are plenty of antics from the star. Nothing over-the-top though. And, it must be said, nothing that's really outrageously funny either. This is an amusing movie but not a hilarious one. But what it may lack in huge laughs it makes up for with charm. Carrey is very endearing. Jennifer Aniston does well with the role of Bruce's girlfriend, Grace. Aniston doesn't get many chances to showcase her comedy chops, those moments are pretty much reserved for Carrey. But she's so charming, eminently lovable. And Morgan Freeman is the perfect God. Sly, witty, but with the sense of authority required of someone who is, you know, God. Maybe Bruce Almighty could have been just a touch funnier. Maybe the movie lays it on a bit thick with its efforts to show that Bruce has really learned something. Most people aren't looking for life lessons with their comedy. But the movie does have significant charms. Bruce Nolan is a guy worth rooting for. The love he has with Grace is worth fighting for. And his attempts to play God are worth enough laughs to enable this movie to succeed.",Bruce Almighty
91,Beta_Gallinger,Still makes me laugh six years later,7,9 October 2009,"I first saw ""Bruce Almighty"" in late 2003 and recognized the star, Jim Carrey. I was seventeen years old at the time, and thought this was a good movie. There are some comedies I saw around that time and found really funny, but watched again several years later and happened to find them very straight-faced, such as ""Johnny English"", a film I saw on the silver screen that year. However, that hasn't quite been the case with this particular comedy. I watched this again in early 2007, and it seemed to be just as good as before. Over two years after that, I've seen it again, and this time, I was slightly disappointed to find that I didn't like it as much as I did during my previous two viewings, but still can't join those who say it's not funny.Bruce Nolan is a news reporter in Buffalo, New York who lives with his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. He does human interest stories, which he is tired of, and hopes for the position of anchorman. Unfortunately for him, that position goes to his rival colleague, Evan Baxter, and after Bruce loses control during a live feed from Niagara Falls, he is fired. After a very bad day, Bruce blames all his problems on God, and is soon confronted by the Almighty! Since the fired reporter has been complaining to God so much, He has decided to give Bruce His powers for a while, to see if he's any better at ruling the world. At first, Bruce takes full advantage of his new powers, and his life appears to be improving. He even uses his powers to get Evan fired so he can take his place, and he doesn't have to worry about his dog urinating on things inside anymore. However, his luck doesn't last, as doing God's job gradually gets harder.Every time I've watched this film, the part where Bruce uses the powers he has gotten from God to make Evan really screw up his report has made me laugh so incredibly hard! There aren't too many comedies I've seen with gags I find THAT funny! That's definitely the funniest part, but there are other memorable gags, such as Bruce freaking out during his live feed around the beginning (which is what leads to his firing), the way the main character gets his revenge on a group of thugs (though I didn't find that one quite as funny as I used to), and Bruce's meeting with God on Mount Everest. Jim Carrey sometimes goes a little overboard with his goofiness, such as the several times when he says, ""It's good. It's goooooood!"" Fortunately, for the most part, this isn't an issue. Also, ""Bruce Almighty"" is not all comedy, as there are serious parts as well, plus some life lessons, as others have obviously pointed out already.Not only does this 2003 release feature the same star as 1997's ""Liar Liar"", both films were also directed by Tom Shadyac. As popular as ""Liar Liar"" is, I just couldn't get into it with Jim Carrey's voices and sounds. The main reason why I think ""Bruce Almighty"" is much better is because Carrey doesn't do that as much here. If you can't stand Carrey as a comedian (it seems he has a lot of critics, which I can understand), and/or you can't stand to see God portrayed in human form (played here by Morgan Freeman), this is definitely a movie you should stay away from. However, if you're a fan of Carrey (die-hard or moderate, I guess) and you want a combination of goofy, sometimes crude comedy and drama/life lessons, you could get a lot out of this film. There's obviously no guarantee you'll like it, but if you ask me, it's worth a try.",Bruce Almighty
92,educallejero,"Ultra predictable, but entertaining",5,13 April 2020,"This movie rest in the shoulders of Jim Carrey. There is almost literally nothing more.
We see a bit of his life before getting ""God's powers"" and then the adventure and predictable tale about ""thinking well what you wish for"", basically.
Carrey is not ""The Mask"" or ""Ace Ventura"" level of obnoxious, so the movie flows well with mostly dumb jokes, some better than others, and a bunch of actual real written jokes too.
Jennifer Anniston is there. It doesn't matter.

93,tim-764-291856,Wishful Fantasy just made for Carrey & Morgan,7,25 January 2013,"This neat idea works on many levels and if like me, you haven't always enjoyed Carrey's OTT mugging and frankly annoying persona at times, it just works better here.We all know the structure to this, where Bruce (Carrey) is given God's powers, by God, a regal white-suited black man, Morgan Freeman, giving the Lord an accessible and friendly, even 'human' persona. Once he has these, Bruce breezily sets about getting what most of us men would be tempted by, bigger breasts for his fiancé (Jennifer Aniston), a new stylish wardrobe and many other slightly dubious wishfuls, pushing the boundaries of taste, but, in my view, not over-extending them, the certificate 12 pointing at this.Revenge to street punks after they laugh and mock his wish for a peaceful world is wreaked in imaginative and witty ways, done with good SFX. Some fairly obvious musical links could mar (Barry White when Bruce pulls the full moon closer, when he intends an ultra-romantic night with Aniston) but generally these are fun and don't outstay their welcome.However, when Bruce kind of uses his powers for his own uses and gets his old job back and things go swimmingly but as backlashes and repercussions from his spontaneous 'miracles' backfire and he loses the love of his fiancé, his powers disappear. The film obviously intends this to have a moral resonance but the light-hearted nature of the comedy obviously dilutes this and some might miss it altogether, whilst the religious will suitably feel that some justice has been done.It does get rather mushy and a bit sickly as Bruce finds that Grace, his fiancé has been praying to the real God (God has an extremely popular and busy email address for prayers that Bruce has access to, another nifty idea!) that her Bruce can find the errors of his ways etc etc. Get over this rather icky patch and you'll bask in the afterglow as the film concludes.",Bruce Almighty

God hears Nolan's complaints and comes to earth and gives Bruce all of his powers in this charming and humorous romantic comedy.Comedy genius Carrey is on top form as Nolan with sharp wit and sophistication in the role of the news reporter. His timing in executing his lines produces brilliant comedy and the physical humour he uses excels brilliantly with great direction from Shadyac.Carrey steals the show, but great support is given from established actors in Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption) and Jennifer Aniston (Friends). Though hardly challenging roles, both do well in their respective roles to achieve the necessary humour to make the picture enjoyable. Steve Carell (The 40 year old virgin) established himself as one of the current greatest comedians in a supporting role as Evan, a fellow news reporter who is excellent in a live TV broadcast, the funniest moment in the entire film.The plot is usually predictable and there is plenty of cheesy dialogue but nonetheless but Carrey simply goes beyond belief in perhaps his most likable role, if not his funniest. His partnership alongside Freeman works a treat and is a reason to watch this film.Although I love Carrey and his comic genius, I would like to see him do more serious projects, like Eternal Sunshine and the spotless mind.Carry on watching the credits as some hilarious outtakes are included.The contrasts with normality and fantasy add to the humour and are an interesting side story to the film. The use of free will and the unusual activities caused by Bruce's behaviour are interesting to see, such as what happens when you mess with everyday normality such as the moon and a meteorite hitting earth.Though following many conventions in the romantic genre, the comedy and the characters are enough to keep the film going and is a real light-hearted good natured comedy.",Bruce Almighty
95,gbheron,"Old Time Religion, Modern Hollywood ***Spoilers***",4,8 September 2003,"This is an odd movie; its values are strictly social conservative, but the story takes place against the backdrop of a large city television newsroom. Seem a little incongruous? Its even more so when you realize the primary actors are Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Anniston. And the films style is essentially a slapstick comedy accentuating Carrey's patented rubber-faced, self-effacing schtick. Strange, yes, but a winning combination scoring an $80M opening weekend. Big money maker or not, I found the movie unfunny and boring. The premise that God would select a failed TV newsman to replace Him while He took a vacation is just too absurd. Someone like the Marx Brothers could have had a field day with this premise, but you sure wouldn't have found them developing a maudlin, sappy conclusion like the one that Bruce Almighty serves up. After an hour and a half of mostly unfunny Jim Carrey pratfalls, the movie presents its ""come to Jesus"" revelatory moment and Bruce is saved (in the religious sense).  After all the damage he'd done playing God, you'd have thought him more deserving of a one way ticket to Hell.",Bruce Almighty
96,jon.h.ochiai,"In Jim, We Trust",8,16 June 2003,"Tom Shadyac's ""Bruce Almighty"" starring Jim Carrey is flat out funny. Jim Carrey is totally in his medium-- comedy. ""Bruce"" has a surprisingly good story by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe, and Steve Oedekerk. Jim Carrey is awesome as Bruce Nolan: wannabe news anchorman and over all whiner. Bruce's life is not what it ought to be... Someone get him a tissue. Anyway, God (wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman) is listening to our whining hero and grants Bruce his powers, so God can take a vacation. The only catch is that Bruce cannot mess with free-will. Jennifer Aniston is absolutely charming, and funny as Bruce's suffering girlfriend. Where else can you see great visual gags, and still address the eternal question: How can you make someone love you, and not mess with free-will? Even God would like to know. Shadyac and Carrey have done their job. They make us laugh big time, make us think, and they never take themselves seriously. Now that is close to godliness.",Bruce Almighty

Watch this movie, it's really, really good.",Bruce Almighty
98,eminkl,Jim Carrey is the Grinch; Jim Carrey is God.,4,17 April 2020,"It's not specifically what he asked for; cursing the Creator over a particularly bad day (humiliated during his flunky comic-relief-TV-reporter job, fired, beaten up, etc.), Carrey just wants to know why God hates him so. It's the suffering of Job reloaded for the media age (will many Americans sympathize with the angst of a presumably well-paid TV personality?), and God, in the person of Morgan Freeman, calls Carrey to Him and offers him a job. ""I'm going on vacation,"" God says, blithely leaving the universe in Carrey's jittery hands. The message is clear: If you think being God is easy, you try it.Bruce Almighty is interesting only insofar as it proposes God as a basically well-meaning if remote deity, not the maddening Shaper who drove William Blake to wonder if the same God made the lamb and the tiger. Fundamentalists whose noses are forever tilted for the scent of sacrilege won't find much in the movie to object to. Morgan Freeman, for instance, embodies God as a hip update of George Burns' avuncular, amused Lord in Oh, God. Both actors are a stroke of casting wit, but a wilder, funnier movie might've given us, say, Danny DeVito or a tipsy, irritable Eddie Izzard as God (heck, we've already had Keanu Reeves as both Buddha and a neo-Christ, no pun intended).Essentially, this is another of Jim Carrey's surefire vehicles that can be whittled down to a phrase: Jim Carrey is the Grinch; Jim Carrey is God. I like the guy, and I wish his box-office failures with The Majestic (understandable -- that was a stiff) and Man on the Moon (I had the poster hanging on my wall for years) hadn't scared him into such bland, unchallenging material. What would Jim Carrey do if given ultimate power? The question provokes a grin of anticipation, but he pretty much does what you see him do in the trailer. There is one spectacularly funny bit when he sabotages the newscast of snotty rival Steve Carell, but the big laughs in the scene belong to Carell, not Carrey.The movie seems squarely aimed at a large audience (check the opening-weekend figures) that might be wondering, in these harrowing times, if God knows what He's doing. Bruce Almighty is here to reassure doubters and put them in their place at the same time. The godlike Carrey fritters away his power and can't even hold onto his girlfriend of five years (Jennifer Aniston, being a good sport). Only God, the movie says, knows how to use the power, and He uses it mostly by not using it: ""You all have the power,"" He lectures Carrey. What should be a wild, unruly, possibly sacrilegious fable think Life of Brian becomes a didactic companion piece to The Truman Show, with Carrey as hapless puppeteer instead of hapless puppet. And it says essentially the same (humanist) thing: Take your life into your own hands.Carrey does get off some good riffs, mostly in his pre-God fits of pique; I enjoyed his obscene jazz-pantomime gesture, destined to be copied by giggling kids from shore to shore. The subtext, though, shows us a man with the power of God who's still insecure and, as the movie spells out, wants to be loved.",Bruce Almighty
99,Rogue-32,Not exactly B.E.A.-utiful,3,2 June 2003,"I was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions: Jim Carrey with Godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me. As a huge fan, I was sure he'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong?  Yesterday, my bubble got burst big-time, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. The first act (where it's set up that he hates his life, he's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against God) is serviceable, the second act (where he's summoned by God via telephone and receives Powers Almighty) is GREAT - Carrey gets to have fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to watch, really funny.  But the third act is wretched beyond belief.The rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who comes off EXCEEDINGLY well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device; even her NAME reeks of unsubtlety) - she thinks he's gonna pop 'the question' but instead, he tells her (on bended knee, yet) that he's finally getting his news anchor job, and isn't it so exciting?She doesn't think so.  She wants him to marry her, see, so she winds up leaving him, see, even though she still LOVES him very much, see, and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic, beyond-heavy-handed spiritual-sounding cliche after the next, until by the end I was praying, too. . .for it to be over. I didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, Bruce prances into the room singing ""What if God were one of us, just a slob like one of us"", blah blah blah), and I was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us (for openers, Morgan Freeman - a/k/a GOD - tells Bruce he can't violate anyone's free will but he does this, a lot). Those choices were forgivable - this is a Jim Carrey comedy, directed by Tom Shadyac - it aint The Remains of the Day. Or rather it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy.  When the script writers lose track of that (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of (gag) Message Movie, what we get instead is hell on earth. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that GRACE is his saving - have to say it - grace, and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued.   All this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy-handed way, however. The film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points.  Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever, light-handed way, so they went the bang-'em-over-the-heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice. They even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out-takes at the end, in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste.  It didn't work for me.",Bruce Almighty
100,aesgaard41,Movie Over-Rated,7,2 January 2004,"I went into this movie liking the idea that God would put his power into a simple mortal and the concept that said mortal would use the power to get into mischief. But why did it have to be Jim Carrey ? I still don't think he all that funny; he mugs, he grins, he makes noises and hams it up and somehow he's considered a comic genius ? What am I missing ? The saving grace in this movie is Morgan Freeman as the Almighty; he is very enjoyable to watch as he spouts pearls of wisdom and portrays the Lord as I would see him; not as a Puritanical dour-faced creator of worlds but as a father figure with a sense of humor. Jennifer Aniston is also in this movie and what better reason to see this movie than to see her boobs get bigger. The comedy is fair, the special effects enjoyable and the plot struggles to stay aloft as Carrey camps it up, but it does have a message without being too preachy and it ends with a wry sense of humor that even Carrey can't foil.",Bruce Almighty

As a result, God gives him much more than a sign that he requested. Bruce is granted the powers of His, thus he starts playing around town. What he's about to find out is that it's much harder than he expected and that free will cannot be influenced in any way.It's a very interesting movie which presents a common person who receives superhuman abilities but soon realizes that life becomes out of a sudden a lot harder as every action of his has terrible consequences. It's presented in a very comical manner thanks to the skills of Jim Carrey, being able to make you laugh with almost every action he undertakes. Apart from the entertainment, it manages to be sad and emotional when required, thus creating a very pleasant atmosphere which you follow eagerly towards the finale. A very good comedy overall, thanks to some very good actors and a very well written and implemented plot.",Bruce Almighty
103,Atreyu_II,What if God was one of us?,6,19 August 2008,"You know that famous Joan Osborne's song ""One of us""? This movie is a vision of what if God was one of us. It was directed by Tom Shadyac, the same guy who directed the great ""Liar Liar"". While ""Bruce Almighty"" is an okay movie, it isn't a great movie. ""Liar Liar"" is far superior, more clever and way funnier. Not that ""Bruce Almighty"" isn't funny. It has its comical moments, but it never is as strong as ""Liar Liar"".The story is original, different and has its funny side, but can be offensive for some people. It isn't offensive for me, however.This film casts Jim Carrey as the Bruce Almighty of the title, who isn't that almighty as you'll see all over the movie. Morgan Freeman and the pretty Jennifer Aniston also star in this film.The best scenes of the film are, in my opinion, the following: when Bruce inserts stars in the sky and pushes the moon closer to us; when he's testing his new powers at the sound of the cool song ""The Power""; when Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman are standing still on the sea and then we see Jim Carrey running above the sea. I mean, can you imagine the sensation, what would it be like if us humans could walk and run above the sea as if we were doing the same in any ordinary street? And imagine how far could we go and what we could explore...Overall, it's an okay comedy but nothing special. It is, however, recommendable for those who like Jim Carrey's humor.",Bruce Almighty
104,mario_c,"""I got the power""",7,23 February 2008,"It's an entertaining comedy with a clear and nice message: it's not easy to be almighty! I enjoyed this movie because of two main reasons. First, it has some funny jokes, especially in the ""first half"" of the film. Second, its main message: the great difficulty of being too much powerful. In fact, should not be easy to have the power to control everything, because we can never please everyone! People are so different that is impossible to please them all! On the other side of the message there's the point that many people don't even know want they want to themselves, so how could they be God and rule everything? That's the case of the main character of this movie BRUCE NOLAN (played by Jim Carrey).This movie, and the kind of comedy used, was done in Jim Carrey's measure, as he fits perfectly the character. Though, and in spite of the good message I did refer above, it's a ""pop corn comedy"" done in Hollywood's standards, so I can't score it more than 7/10 (and a great part of this score is for the jokes!). A story like this but with another kind of cinematography I think I would give a better score! However, it's an entertaining and enjoyable film.",Bruce Almighty

The movie manages to take a serious topic and make it funny, but not in a bad way. Instead of making fun of God, it shows how impossible the job of being God really is. I like that it brings out how complex it is and by giving everyone what they want, the world would be a mess, but by doing things for yourself it really messes things up too. The film does a great job showing different aspects of it while keeping it light and funny at the same time.",Bruce Almighty

Well, he has been a psycho pet detective, he has been a liar, he has been a peculiar fellow, but this time heactually plays God! Well, to be correct he plays a man with the powers of God.The movie shimmers something pretty special, but it doesn't egt that funny,or, let me put it this way; the movie has the opportunity to get  very nice and hilarious, but it doesn't grab the chance. It doesn't use the entertaining plot, it almost pushes it away and makes instead a nearly bad romance story between Carrey and a lady that looks like Jennifer Aniston, and is his girlfriend. Well, the thing where this movie misses bigtime is in the pity part for Bruce Nolan (Carrey), that he is like having a such bad time with his fellow reporter doing so much better, you really don't feel pity for the guy.Bruce Nolan is a maybe a bit sad reporter that has a girlfriend, house, nice car and dog. Well, he keeps complaining to God that he is having such a bad life,well, so one day God gives him his powers. So, God (or Morgan Freeman if you like), gives him almighty powers!

As a concept, ""Bruce Alimighty"" could have gone in a number of directions--- a few good, many bad. But the course the movie takes is charming, winsome, wholesome, and remarkably reverent. It is hilarious, but also was ""about"" something. I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie was about redemption, and self-empowerment. Love themes, and consciousness expanding themes, are usually met with derision and scorn by some lifeless, ego-tripping critics who consider themselves tragically hip, and somehow ""Cooler Than Thou."" Not surprisingly, there have been a few negative reviews by these members of the self-conscious Undead. However, many excellent critics have praised the movie, and I totally agree. It is life-affirming, funny, heart-warming. Thoroughly bright and entertaining.Jennifer Anniston is such a great actor! Who knew her TV gig would evolve her into a real person with amazing grace, wit, and heart? Yaay Jennifer! And Jim Carrey is equally amazing here, as is the always magnificent Morgan Freeman. Go see it with a loved one, or someone you hope will become a loved one. You'll be uplifted and very, very glad you went! ""Bruce Almighty"" is a total 10 out of 10!",Bruce Almighty

Yup!Bruce is a Buffalo, NY, TV reporter stuck with all the funny human interest stories while he yearns to be an anchor.  He lives with Grace Connelly, the lovely Jennifer Aniston, (wonder why IMDb gives only Grace's first name in the cast list while providing Bruce's last name, Nolan). The couple have a somewhat un-housetrained but adorable pooch, Sam.  Ms. Aniston really brings her role to life. So does Sam.Bruce encounters God (the real McCoy) played by an impish Morgan Freeman. Now this God isn't your fire-breathing Jehovah nor is he a sad-with-his-creations's-follies Lord.  He's a Deity for Our Time, a well-dressed and soft-spoken fellow - decidedly non-denominational - who does a mean job with a mop on a big floor (he probably can do windows too but that wasn't in the film).  Yes, THIS God could pull me away from my agnosticism.  The only thing I expected Freeman to do that he didn't was roll out a fundraising scam.This is a comedy with a nice dollop of romance.  And it works because the action is fast and the acting first-rate.  The story - God comes down to check things out - has been done many times but this is the first film where he transfers his power and authority to a mere mortal.  Given it's Jim Carrey, a goofball misuse of the great power is inevitable.  But Carrey pulls it off nicely.No great message here - just some good fun.8/10.",Bruce Almighty
110,movieguy1021,Bruce Almighty: 6/10,6,24 May 2003,"Bruce Almighty has more continuity errors than an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. Most have to do with the ending, so I won't spoil them, although I'll guess that you will be able to tell what the ending will be. It has its moments, some very good ones at that, but it can't seem to get over its cocky tones. It seems like a vehicle to get Jim Carrey back on target, teamed up with director Tom Shadyac again (Ace Ventura, Liar Liar), and an easy $100 million or so for Universal, and a possibility for a sequel.Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past two months knows the plot: man revolts against God; man gets God's powers. That man is Bruce Nolan (Carrey), angry that the anchor position at his news station didn't go to him. He's just a lowly reporter who has to get into ridiculous outfits. After he curses God once too often, God Himself (Morgan Freeman) turns up and gives Bruce the chance to have His powers, to see if Bruce can do it better. At first, Bruce uses them to his advantage, but must learn to cope with them.Jim Carrey can be funny when he wants to be, and he can also be a good actor when he wants to be. He returns to his mid-90's slapstick, while incorporating his acting from The Truman Show, and, dare I say it, The Majestic? Although the humor isn't as broad as his earlier work, and the acting isn't as strong, there's still good doses of both. There's as much crude humor as one-liners.However, Bruce Almighty can't keep away from the clichés. Bruce can't climb up the ladder, his pretty girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) is a kind preschool teacher, his coworkers are mean, et cetera. If that wasn't bad enough, it also tries to be another `classic' Carrey movie. There's a new `catchphrase' (B-E-A-utiful, which it REALLY stupid), and there's symbolism and meaningful characters and objects that just keep on popping in for no reason, like the prayer bracelet and the bum.Something that always strikes me as odd is all of the complaints against the film. It seems that movies like The Last Temptation of Christ, Dogma, and now Bruce Almighty have Christians boycotting the film for `mocking God.' As the saying goes, God has a sense of humor, look at the platypus. It's just extra marketing and publicity.It had some pretty funny scenes, and at times the laughs were pretty big. I don't, however, understand why the audience was cracking up at the `seven fingers' joke (it's just like `You've got me straight trippin', boo,' from Bringing Down the House). I thought that most scenes were funny, except for the last quarter, when the laughs slowed dramatically. Also, I thought that the cinematography was surprisingly good for a slob comedy like this. It worked best when Bruce was `parting the Red Sea.'Could Jim Carrey be coming back to what made him famous? Could Morgan Freeman be billed higher for being in about three scenes? Will Jennifer Aniston ever be cast in a role other than the `cute girlfriend'? We may find out as Universal will probably release Bruce Almighty 2: Heavens Above!My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for language, sexual content and some crude humor.",Bruce Almighty
111,LebowskiT1000,Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac can't go wrong!,10,18 July 2003,"Jim Carrey has got to be one of my favorite actors, I have yet to see him in a role that I didn't like.  He's nothing less than hilarious and I don't care what anyone says, he's a fantastic actor.  On top of that, Tom Shadyac is a superb director, making his third film with Jim Carrey (the previous two being: ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""Liar Liar"").  The instant I heard they were working together again, I knew I'd love the movie.  So opening day rolled around and I wasted no time in getting myself to the movie theater to enjoy the film.  And of course, I was not let down, I laughed myself silly and had an all around great time.The story is beyond far-fetched, but it's all in good fun and actually has a good ""moral to the story"" as they say.  The film is mainly about doing what it right and being happy with yourself.I'll admit though this is the first movie where I thought Jim Carrey was a little too nutty at times.  Like the whole tantrum on the bed when Jennifer Aniston is telling him to get out of bed, and a few other cases.  But the scenes where I was laughing so hard that the tears started flowing more than made up for those few ""too nutty"" scenes.On top of the great story and the hilarious comedy, there is also a fair amount of special effects in the film, which are nothing less than great and work very well with the story.  And of course, there is the lovely Jennifer Aniston, need I say more?  She's looked better, but she did a fine job in the role and I enjoyed watching her performance.  Morgan Freeman was another fine addition to the cast, doing a very nice job with his role.What it boils down to is this.  If you liked ""Ace Ventura"" or ""Liar Liar"", then you definitely ought to check this movie out.  If you like Jim Carrey in general, see this movie!  If you aren't a fan of Jim Carrey, I'm not sure what to tell you, I guess I'd say see it anyway...you never know, you might like it.  Thanks for reading.-LebowskiT1000",Bruce Almighty
112,Horror-yo,Good comedy about God and love,8,20 May 2016,"Jim Carrey meets Morgan Freeman, God, and gets to take on his responsibilities for a while. Jim Carrey gets to be God, and we get to watch that on the big screen. Only with great power, comes great responsibility, that old chorus, and quickly Carrey discovers the burden of it all. He quickly walks up the social ladder and forgets the things that are more important in life, more important to him. This film is about opportunity, and living in the present moment, being there and standing strong before the things we love dissolve out of our own fingers, and no quick fix can bypass our own effort. Along the way there are good laughs, we all remember that scene with Steve Carrell being out of control with his speech as the anchorman, and Carrey delivers the goods as he always does. Morgan Freeman, superb as God. Very believable. It's a well made little mainstream comedy with a few points, and good ones; that lets itself watched.

113,policy134,"Basically a repeat of Liar, liar but compared to the Truman Show quite enjoyable.",5,24 March 2005,"Yes, Jim Carrey could probably act in this movie and sleep at the same time. He has played this character under different aliases so manny times that it seems that he just wanted to cash in his check this time. Maybe he was tired of being rejected by the Academy so many times that he just threw in the towel and said: ""The hell with it!"". Even so, this is a somewhat worthy effort. Bruce, as Carrey calls himself this time, would probably never get out of the rut he is in (much like Carrey's role in the Mask) if fate hadn't stepped in, actually the personification of fate, God. Somehow, we laugh more at people's misfortune than charm (think Homer Simpson, Al Bundy etc.). When Bruce gets the powers of God we are only slightly amused but kind of bored. I can't really speak for everybody but I think many will agree.The performances are what we expect in a movie like this, even Morgan Freeman gives a somewhat limited performance (congratulations on finally winning an Oscar). Jennifer Aniston is underused as Lisa Kudrow was in the two Analyze films. The one surprise is Steve Carell, who has a new show premiering tonight on US TV. In the scene where Carrey makes his usual grunt noises and makes them come out of Carells mouth, it's astounding how well they play together. I don't know how many times they retook this but it's the best part of the movie.The endless last 30 minutes seemed tacked on by Carrey himself to make some kind of statement to the audience. What a waste of film, we didn't want to see another retread of ""It's a wonderful life"" for the umpteenth time and I think Carrey should stick to one formula at a time. The same happened in Liar, liar but they only wasted 10 minutes in that movie. I understand that Carrey had a new film in theaters with a serious role again. I can't figure him out but maybe i'm not meant to because then there would be nothing to write about him.",Bruce Almighty

I remember I first appreciate Jim Carrey in ""The Mask"" (1994) with the talented Cameron Diaz in her debut role.     ""Bruce Almighty"" is a parable without a doubt. Jim Carrey back in his elements, with partners in fun - Jennifer Aniston as Grace the girlfriend desirable, and Morgan Freeman as God the friend indispensable. Together they delivered an entertaining tale about how Carrey's character Bruce eventually learned his life lessons and became the model citizen aspired by all. Yes, the comedic tempo basically is 'driven' by the manic energy of Carrey's, but both Freeman and Aniston contributed their subtle humorous touches with just the right dosage to the mix. It was amusing watching the trio, and (not forgetting) the dog, along with the supporting cast, making this Tom Shadyac movie another Hollywood hit.  Director Tom Shadyac's other endeavors include: Patch Adams (1998), a rather serious film with Robin Williams - another manic energy unlimited; and The Nutty Professor (1996 remake) with Eddie Murphy - yet another genius in hilarity.Morgan Freeman is a prolific actor since his famous role as Miss Daisy's chauffeur opposite Jessica Tandy in Bruce Beresford's ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989). I found his two 'Charlie' roles most delightful: he was Charlie in Neil LaBute's ""Nurse Betty"" (2000) opposite Renée Zellweger and co., and as Charlie Grimes opposite Ashley Judd in Carl Franklin's ""High Crimes"" (2002).
I first appreciate Jennifer Aniston's acting in Edward Burns' ""She's The One"" (1996). She carried the central roles in Glenn Gordon Caron's ""Picture Perfect"" (1997) opposite Jay Mohr; Nicholas Hytner's ""The Object of My Affection"" (1998) opposite Paul Rudd; and Miguel Arteta's ""The Good Girl"" (2002) opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and co. She gave steady supporting roles to Mark Wahlberg in Stephen Herek's ""Rock Star"" (2001), and to Ron Livingston in Mike Judge's ""Office Space"" (1999).Jim Carrey's more serious drama roles include: Frank Darabont's ""The Majestic"" (2001) opposite Martin Landau and co.; Peter Weir's ""The Truman Show"" (1998) opposite Ed Harris, Laura Linney and co.; and the controversial dark menacing role of the cable guy opposite Matthew Broderick in Ben Stiller's ""The Cable Guy"" (1996).",Bruce Almighty

118,FilmFanInTheHouse,Fun Idea in a Fun Film,7,15 January 2008,"Bruce Almighty (2003, Dir. Tom Shadyac) Bruce Nolan doesn't think the world is treating him fairly. He is a news reporter who keeps getting the worst stories he could ever get, and life just doesn't seem to go right for him. The one person he blames the most is God. But when God responds, Bruce finds himself the responsibility of God's. Now his chance to make life perfect has appeared, but as he enjoys his new found powers, he starts to mistreat the things that matters the most.If you ever seen a comedy film of Jim Carrey's, then you know what a talented improviser he is. And this film goes not let him go to waste. His facial expressions and how he says things can actually crack you up. There are some scenes in which his performance feels cheesy, but every actor has one of those. It's actually fun to see the many ways in which they have decided to show God's powers in this film, and Jim Carrey obviously enjoys performing with such a script. Morgan Freeman is a delight to watch as always, but the best scene in the movie goes too Steve Carell, who's 'possession' scene is priceless.

120,acedj,Extremely enjoyable film.,8,19 November 2019,"The is the story of Bruce Nolan, played by Jim Carrey. Bruce is living with his girlfriend Grace played by Jennifer Aniston, and they have a comfortable life together, but Bruce wants more. Constantly looked over for more serious work as a news reporter because of his naturally goofy demeanor, he covets the news lead job that is coming open. When this falls through, Bruce goes on a self destructive rampage, cursing out God the entire time, even taunting him. As luck would have it, be it bad or good, God was listening. He bestows unto Bruce all his powers, to see if Bruce can do a better job of being God than God does. Bruce goes down the path of fixing his life to where he feels he should be, but looses Grace in the process.
Morgan Freeman who plays God, is about the most talented actor out there, and does not disappoint in this albeit small role. The story is great with a lot of laughs thrown in. And yes, there is a moral to this story as well.",Bruce Almighty
121,lagudafuad,fun,7,21 December 2012,"What if you had the role of God, do you think you would have done a better job?Bruce Almighty may not be a critic favorite, with a weak CGI, a not too perfect script and many loose ends but it is one funny movie. The wonderful chemistry, between Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston made them a beautiful on-screen couple trying to cope with the things life dishes out at you. And my favorite line in the movie came from when Bruce was trying to stop Grace (Jennifer Aniston) from leaving him: Bruce: You can't leave me, I'm the Alpha baby, I'm the Omega lady.Bruce Almighty is a slap stick comedy, something that Carrey fits just easily, the movie is funny and the ideas that the writers brought to the screen to show the height of selfishness in the heart of a man who had power, was something that I found to be true.One of the ideas that can be said to have taken from Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), is when Bruce actually lassoed the moon, something George Bailey said he was willing to do for Mary, in the scene (in the movie it's a wonderful life) where both walked home singing buffalo girl.Directed by Tom Shadyac, whose first directorial film was also with Jim Carrey in the Ace Ventura series, which is the only movie that Jim Carrey did a part two of.The movie revolves around Bruce (Jim Carrey) who complains about how God is not being fair to him, so one day he gets a visit from the Almighty God (Morgan Freeman), who gives Bruce his powers to do as he pleases.But things turn from sweet to sour when Bruce learns a hard lesson, that being God is not just as easy as he thought.Although highly criticized the movie has a huge cult following, (I included as I have seen this movie countless times) in the box office it made over 480 million dollars (its production cost was 81 million) in its theatrical run, no matter what the critics say you just want to see what Bruce did with God's power.A sequel Evan Almighty was done in 2007 with Jim Carrey refusing to reprise his role as he doesn't like playing the same role twice, the movie did have Morgan Freeman reprise his role as God and this time the center character was Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), the antagonist of the first film. Evan Almighty was a financial blunder, not recouping its production cost in the box office. I have seen it and I can just advice that you just stay away from it.Bruce Almighty is funny and fun, although not much of a family fun but you will like it.www.lagsreviews.com",Bruce Almighty

Unfortunately he doesn't, and this leads to some really annoying moments, where you wonder what is going on and why.Like some of the catch phrases, the stupid faces and over emphasised movements, and the scene where the newsreader copies his facial movements, and it goes on, and on, and on.There are a few snigger touching moments, but they are few and far between, and the setups and the eventual plot finish, are so Hollywood formula you want to weep.Give it a miss.

While this film may be pretty brainless and simplistic it is yet another top draw comedy from the rubber faced king of comedy. Jim is on fire here as Bruce who complains about god a little too much and so is endowed with Gods powers to see how he fares running the world. Jim is typically hilarious mugging his way through the film which has its fair share of riotous moments, most usually with Jim on screen.Morgan Freeman stars as God (could anyone else?) and is good and Jennifer Aniston is infectious and combines well with Jim in her first box office success. The film has the sugary ending that Liar Liar did although not quite as bad, however the rest of the film isn't quite as strong as Liar Liar. Still a cracking comedy. ***",Bruce Almighty

(Please note I liked The Truman Show and moments of Ace Ventura).Bruce (Carrey) is fed up with life, continually getting shafted by people and his dog. After one big outburst and a cry to God, he finds himself face to face with the Creator (played excellently by Mr Class, Morgan Freeman). God decides to let Bruce have a go at ruling the world for a while while he takes a break. Bruce is obviously initially wary, but as he soon discovers he does indeed possess incredible power, except to change free will. Bruce starts off fixing his life, but soon discovers it's not all about him.A well written and well done movie. Carrey does a solid job, with plenty of great lines and scenes, the highlights being the the ""I've got the power"" sequence, ruining Evan's news reading carrer and his sudden ability to land scoop stories.Well worth seeing.

Soon, however, he starts to get paged and after awhile he calls the number.God (Morgan Freeman) meets Bruce in an empty building and after a hilarious sequence of 'how many fingers I'm holding up' Bruce receives God's powers. The movie becomes side-splitting funny after this point and continues on until a very strange yet important ending in which the city riots over four hundred thousand lottery tickets that are all the winning ticket.Carrey brings out a hilarious character in Bruce and Aniston perfect for the role of Grace. The message some may overlook that (if you believe in God or any creator) that it's not always the creators fault and job to make us happy. It is our responsibility. The acting is fine in the movie. The sequences of Carrey news reporting are ingenious. The movie (in my opinion) is Carrey's best since The Truman Show (1998) and Aniston is actually acting in this film (suprising!). Bruce Almighty.

The plot: Carey is a newsman in Buffalo whose frustrations over his unmet aspirations to be a news anchor cause him to challenge God himself. God, in the form of Morgan Freeman, accepts his challenge setting up a pretty decent opportunity for some laughs. The choice to put Carrey's character in Buffalo rather than the New York City where most movies are set, seems to resonate in a symbolic sense, as the world Carrey inhabits always seems to be a little off the norm. Aside from Carrey's comedy, and a convincing performance by Morgan Freeman (as convincing as humanly possible, that is, considering he's playing God), I liked this movie because at heart it's very uplifting and speaks great truths about the power of love and `being a miracle.'",Bruce Almighty
131,SonicStuart,Very Very Funny!,10,9 May 2004,"Bruce AlmightyStarring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Steve Carrell and Jennifer AnistonGenre: ComedyRated: PG-13Jim Carrey has done it again with this really funny and successful comedy!This movie is about a man named Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) who is a news-reporter for one of the news stations in the city of Buffalo, NY and he lives in his apartment with his girlfriend Grace, (Jennifer Aniston). One day, he has a very bad day because he didn't get promoted in his job, he lost his job and plus he got beaten up my some hoods and Bruce thinks the God (Morgan Freeman) is picking on him. So then the next day when Bruce visits God they discuss things and so Bruce was offered to be God for 1 week so Bruce got to have God's job which I think sounds really cool! So while Bruce is God, God is out taking a vacation. I thought this movie was just very clever with all the jokes and all. One of my favorite parts is where Bruce was in God's office and he opens the file cabinet and it was shooting out really long! Another one of my favorite parts is where Bruce was getting even with the hoods and one of them said the day that they apologized would be the day when a monkey came out of his butt and obviously it did! Another funny thing was that Bruce also used his powers to help the NHL team, the Buffalo Sabres win the Stanley Cup. The most hilarious part in the entire movie is when Bruce is missing up one of the other news casters when he was reading a report! This movie was just laugh-out loud hilarious!

132,TheHonestCritic,"This is the best comedy movie in cinema, in my opinion. (Yet, it's so much more than just a comedy).",10,1 August 2019,"""Bruce Almighty"" (2003), when I first watched this movie, it changed my outlook on the genre of comedy. It's yet another example of what I consider a perfect movie. ""Bruce Almighty"" also happens to be one of my top 10 all-time favorite movies! While ""The Three Stooges"" is my favorite comedy TV show and my all-time favorite TV show overall, ""Bruce Almighty"" is my favorite comedy movie. It's my favorite comedy film of all-time for one big reason; Jim Carrey. He makes this film, had this movie been cast with someone else as the character of Bruce Nolan, this movie might not have worked. Jim Carrey is not the only A-list comedy actor in this movie, Steve Carell; one of my other favorite comedy actors, is in this movie also. These two actors play off each other very well, put them both together and hilarity ensues! Before I saw this movie, I always wondered what it would be like if Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell were in a movie together. Sure enough, it works brilliantly and dreams really do come true! They may not be together during the whole movie, but when they do a comedy scene together it's comedic gold, and in this case less is more. Jennifer Aniston is great as Grace, the fiancee of Bruce. She and Jim Carrey have great chemistry in this movie! Also, they could not have picked a better actor to play God. If any actor could pull off that role, Morgan Freeman is definitely the best candidate for the part. This movie has a great story, great special effects, great sets/locations, great soundtrack, and of course great acting. It fires on all cylinders! As I mentioned, this movie is much more than just a comedy. It has a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, and a touch of action to keep it interesting. I will not reveal the ending, truth be told, it's one of the best endings in cinema. You'll laugh and you'll cry when you see the ending, but I assure you that you're going to have tears of sadness, but also joy. If you're watching this movie for the first time, bring a box of tissues for the ending. Even though I've seen this movie countless times, I still get choked up watching the ending. This is Jim Carrey's best movie, bar-none. It expands on his true complexity as an actor, and it shows that he can do much more than just comedy. I can watch it 1,000 times in a row and laugh just as hard, if not harder, every single time I view it. Without question, I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""Bruce Almighty"", what are you waiting for? I guarantee you that you'll laugh, and be moved like you've never been before in your life!",Bruce Almighty
133,bix171,Carrey Shines But The Film Doesn't,6,15 June 2003,"This should probably be a fine vehicle for Jim Carrey--a hard-luck soft-news anchor is given the reins while God takes a vacation--and his enormous comedic skills are very much in evidence (which alone makes it worth recommending) but there seems to be a bit too much restraint and tidiness on display, a classic example of Universal Studio's sanitized version of America; ostensibly set in Buffalo, it could be Anywhere U.S.A. as long as it's the spotless, W.A.S.P. Anywhere U.S.A. the studio insists on force-feeding the world. (The fact that God is played by African-American Morgan Freeman seems meant to throw us off the track but doesn't--God may be black but He apparently has little interest in anyone other than His white followers.) Carrey throws himself into the project, capitalizing on the apparent desperation he's exhibiting while trying to recover from his disappointing serious work (`The Truman Show', `Man In The Moon') and his physical comedy has never been better; but while it's a pleasure to watch a master craftsman at work, the material he's given works only sporadically, most notably in extended scenes such as an on-air meltdown at Niagara Falls and his tormenting of the anchor who's passed him over for the top job. (The anchor is nicely played by Steven Carell, displaying the same crack timing as Carrey.) While Carrey makes the movie worthwhile, the overall pacing is slack, thanks to the lackluster direction by Tom Shadyac, who, as in films such as `The Nutty Professor', prefers to just point the camera and let his stars bring him the glory.",Bruce Almighty

This is not his best film but this is in my top ten favorite Jim Carrey movies. I must say, though, this is one of his more, how shall I put this, more dramatic and sad movies, especially the end. This movie also has some solid acting by Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman as God, not to mention Jennifer Aniston. I also found that the It's A Wonderful Life parody to be cheesy yet funny. Here is the plot of this movie. Bruce Nolan does not exactly a great life. He is fired from his job and he lives with his girlfriend. Then he meets God. God tells Bruce that he can be God to see how it is like. Bruce discovers that being God is not exactly easy. He has to answer people's question and so forth. He also discovers that being God can be fun. He can get a new car and he can do anything that he wants. Then his girlfriend leaves him. Bruce then gets hit by a car. He is not God anymore. His girlfriend comes back and he has a better life, and he marries his girlfriend. Overall, this is a very good and funny film. There is really heart-wrenching moments yet there is some moments that you laugh so hard until you twitch on the floor. I also like the moment with the gangsters and the monkey. Anyway, this is a great movie with cheesy moments and some very solid moments but either way they are moments and this is a solid film overall.

138,cinephile-27690,A Heavenly Comedy!,10,25 September 2018,"I first watched this when I was 8, which surprised me since it was PG-13 and my parents restricted many movies from me for religious reasons.(Witchcraft, nudity, language, etc.-some of those are fair but others seem far fetched.)Anyways, I'm 20 now and this movie is even more enjoyable. Part of that is understanding adult jokes that originally went over my head. I'll get back to that.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a news reporter who is mad at God. And why not? He lost his job, gets beaten up by a gang, and is seen as less superior to a co-anchor. Well, God(ironically played by atheist-agnostic Morgan Freeman) comes to him and gives Bruce his powers for a week to see if he can do a better job.This-at first-seems great. Now to deal with his problems or have fun, he can lift a woman's skirt, part red soup(in reference to Moses), lasso the moon(in reference to It's a Wonderful Life), view prayers on a computer file, make his girlfriend have an intense orgasm, and much more. (I don't want to spoil for you what he does with a monkey.)But then Bruce gets a taste of how hard being our Maker is. Maybe being a human isn't so bad.I mentioned that there were adult jokes. If I did not get them when I was 8, your kid probably won't either. I recommend kids around there and up to see this. (If they don't know the F word-there's one use to watch out for).One joke that used to go over my head is when Steve Carrell's character Evan annoys Bruce, so he says, ""Do you like Jazz, Evan? Let me play some for you."" He makes sounds and twiddles his fingers like an instrument, and raises his middle finger when he holds a note. As a kid, I was like ""Why are the others in the room laughing?"" Now I laugh at that as well.Theist or not, Bruce Almighty is a very comedic and fun movie that really is heavenly.

140,Stompgal_87,One of Carrey's finest,8,19 August 2013,"I've seen this film a few times already. Sure it's not quite as funny as 'Dumb and Dumber' but it still has its laughs and memorable moments.The best-known cast members in this film are Jim Carrey as the titular character, Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend Grace who is a kindergarten teacher, Morgan Freeman as God (a rather unusual choice but supportive nonetheless) and Steve Carell as Bruce's colleague Evan (who went on to star in his own film as a sequel to this one). As for its memorable moments, these include the giant cookie world record attempt at the beginning, Bruce's dog 'using the bathroom' in the house and Bruce eventually getting him to 'do his thing' outside, Bruce reporting at Niagra Falls whilst wearing an umbrella hat (which I thought he called New York by mistake), a long drawer coming out of a filing cabinet and pushing Bruce along, Grace noticing that her boobs had got bigger overnight, Grace preventing a child from eating paste at kindergarten, another child overhearing Bruce say a** and Bruce telling him he was talking about a donkey, the homeless man holding signs with phrases like 'R EWE BLIND?,' 'THY KINGDUM COME' and 'ARMAGEDDON OUTTA HERE,' and last but not least Bruce causing Evan to mess up during his news report, which was probably the most amusing scene in the entire film.Overall, this is a fine outing from Jim Carrey with a talented supporting cast. 8/10.",Bruce Almighty
141,stormhawk2021,This film is cool.,8,13 May 2017,"In the comedy, ""Bruce Almighty"", Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is passed over for a job as anchorman on their local news channel. He believes that God is forgetting his needs and blatantly ignoring him. God (Morgan Freeman) contacts Bruce and gives him all his powers as a test for Bruce to show that he can do a better job. With his new powers, Bruce uses them for himself until he realizes the world's prayers are being unanswered. Before writing this review, I have watched Bruce Almighty countless times. It's my favorite movie, it's funny, and my sister and I enjoy watching it together because it's a very family friendly film. Based on the first category, Action, I would give this movie an A. There's little suspense, but the comedy in the film keeps the viewer interested. A good example of action in this film is when Bruce runs into a group of gang members beating on a homeless man, later he runs into the same group, this time, scaring them off using his newly found powers. This movie deserves an A in the category, Actors. Jim Carrey is so funny and outgoing but also believably serious when he is needed to be. A great example of this is when he asks Grace (his ex girlfriend) to come back to him and give him another chance (serious). When she refused he tried to use his powers to make her love him again even when he knew he couldn't go against free will (goofy). I gave Bruce Almighty an A in the category, storyline. The story is wacky, funny, and easy to follow. An example of putting comedy into this movie is when Bruce went to the cafe right after gaining God's powers and prating the tomato soup, resembling the parting of the red sea mentioned in the Bible. In my opinion, this film is an A in length.The runtime is about an hour and 40 minutes long. The movie is not extremely long but it's long enough to keep the viewers interested and you definitely feel satisfied by the end. In the category, cinematography, I rated this film a B. It doesn't have horrible editing and effects but they're not extremely impressive or believable. An example of this is when Bruce was filming a segment on his news channel and wanted to bring interest, so, using his powers, he made a meteorite crash down in the distance. Not fabulous editing but it made it funny. As a result, in my opinion, this move has 4 A's and 1 B. It's a great family movie and it's funny, Interesting, goofy, and some-what sad at times. It's perfect for late movie nights if you're looking for a good laugh.",Bruce Almighty

143,tributarystu,"The name's Almighty. Why, Bruce, of course!",7,27 August 2003,"As soon as I heard about this movie I knew it would be interesting and controversive in the same time. Just the idea of someone ( not to mention Jim Carey) playing God seemed a little outrageous especially after pondering on what unorthodox things he might do. The movie had to have a comedy flavor, because that makes up for most unorthodox ideas, still I did wonder if they didn't go to for with this one. I guess not, but I am sure there are people who would condemn me for my appreciation...those people who dare to actually think Harry Potter is evil(check the Witchcraft repackaged thing).SPOILERSHow many times did you give the fault to God for all the bad things that have happened in your life? I can't recall. It's something quite natural, as most are of the opinion that He created, He gives and He takes. Of course the people who do not bother to think beyond that will hardly understand why things aren't always peachy. In a way, Bruce was one of those people. Sure, he had suffered setbacks despite being good in what he did, he had to live with the treachery he had suffered, but haven't we all had such? Definitely what brought Bruce in the ""God business"" was the fact that he was a good person, even if egocentric at times, and he had the ability to help many people. He just had to learn that. We all have this ability, but we are sometimes too bothered with ourselves. Once Bruce gets the chance to be God, he does all he desires(only for himself, of course) and learns, as was expected, that it isn't as easy as it seemed. It's all a very strange problem. Difficult even. The human mind can hardly conceive the term of ""God"", of someone alone who takes care of all. So it is practically impossible to be a human and play God...and play God well. That's not possible, it just ain't, because He is not just ""something"". At least that's how I see it. Morgan Freeman is God, a funny and not entirely distasteful twist. He's just such a good guy all the time, I guess he deserved to play God as well. Jim is just tremendous, despite some usual over-hyped scenes, but he usually brings comedy to a new level, with his characteristic faces. And as a couple with Jennifer, it can only get better.""Bruce Almighty"" is, obviously, far from serious. It's a bit of silly fun with a few simple teachings at the basis of the story. I mean I haven't seen anything I didn't expect, labeled ""message"". It was all as we learn at school God would do it. You are offered the chance to laugh pretty often, so just take advantage of it! Sure, some things are too silly, but that's all about having fun. So just get to see Bruce.",Bruce Almighty
144,anxietyresister,Funny in parts but too mawkish by half.. SPOILERS,5,24 June 2005,"Jim Carrey is a funny guy. I've seen him in a lot of productions, and he has never failed to make me chuckle. This role is no exception, he has several hilarious moments involving his new-found mystical god powers, including when his partner gets an unrequested prompt boob job, he forces a girl's skirt up in the street and the whole business with the alphabet soup in the cafe. But for me, by far the greatest part in the film is where he loses it on a boat after finding out a rival anchorman has beaten him to a top job, his facial expressions and bitter, twisted attitude to everybody around him are priceless. Yep, for the first 45 minutes or so, life is good and the movie is consistently amusing.Alas, when we get to the middle of this particular morsel we discover a very gooey centre. Not a nice, sweet taste but a horrible, saccharine concoction that will send all self-respecting diabetics into sugar shock. The script requires Jim to experience a 'spiritual reawakening', so he stops messing about with his abilities and starts using them responsibly to help those less fortunate than him. This may be a laudable aim, but it sucks all the humour out of the proceedings like an extra-strong vacuum cleaner. We begin to wonder if we are watching an after-school special rather than a comedy, and the film is derailed irrevocably. Patricularly painful is the ""Answering Wishes On The PC"" sequence, which may seem warm and tender to some but to me the cloying sentimentality almost made me taste breakfast again. Mind you, at this point you get the impression that the unimaginative screenplay writers had run out of decent jokes anyway.Morgan Freeman has a couple of unimpressive cameo appearances as the Lord, Jennifer Aniston is largely wasted as our hero's long suffering partner and there are more dodgy dog jokes than you can shake a stick at (Arf, Arf). And of course the ending is happy, as our protagonist learns that he must not take life for granted and to treasure those that are close to him. He even apologises to those who treated him like a jerk in the first place. Give me a break!! What a pathetic, sappy little man he is.. and how hard it is to care about his fate or build up sympathy for his plight. Sorry Jim, you had me at first, but you really went and blew this one. Next time, try and cut down on the cheese, and just concentrate on making us LAUGH. Not too much to ask, is it now? 5/10",Bruce Almighty
145,herbqedi,Adequate comedy-fantasy,6,27 June 2004,"This is an fast-moving and engaging comedy-fantasy with enough gags that work well to make you overlook the equally abundant duds and the relentless lack of restraint applied to Carrey's performance by both director and actor.  There's no question that Carrey is a genius at goofy comedy, but even genius must be applied appropriately. The rest of the cast fares much better. Morgan Freeman is, of course, magnificent as the Almighty feeling the need to teach Bruce some humility. His scenes are the best in the film.  Catherine Bell (from TV's ""Jag"") is both provocative and luminescent as the co-anchor Susan Ortega.  She gives memorable dimensionality to what could have been a caricature.  Jennifer Aniston continues to prove her mettle as a versatile and aware leading lady. She is perfectly aware that she is merely the obligatory lead female in Carrey's star vehicle, but puts her all into fleshing out Grace as an independent person that we care about.  Philip Baker Hall and Sally Kirkland are solid in important supporting roles while Tony Bennett has a fun cameo.Given the plot's immense possibilities, I am disappointed that the movie chose to channel its energies so narrowly, but at least, in doing so, it made me laugh.  I give it 6/10.",Bruce Almighty

How bout lots? How about rearranging every bit and piece of your life, and making it to your liking. But soon your going to realize that everybody else wants change to, but your soon going to realize your being selfish with your powers... Bruce Almighty is exactly that, and a bit more. It depicts the message, mixing in a little vulgarity, and making it quite a picture. The acting in this film was pretty good. I didn't expect the best, but I got more than I wanted. Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, and Morgan Freeman make this film; even the parts with Steve Carrel. Then we have the next stupendous act, the message. This is why the film gets an 7 for me, because it shows something while not trying to put it out there too much. It's heartwarming, and a bit hard to see through. It shows life, but tries not to. I love that. Everything else was projected pretty well too. The reason the film isn't a 10 for me is because the film tends to be a little childish with it's humor. I mean there's LOTS of hilarious scenes, but sometimes they set the boundary a little too high... or a little too low. Either one, it didn't do it for me. I loved how they showed Morgan Freeman as God (while also making a point) but hating the fact that Jim Carrey had insects flying out of his mouth. All I had to do was get through it, and you will too. I highly recommend this film for people who love films with a message. If your not to fond of crude humor, you might want to stay away, but also know that the film is making points with and within.

To have a man being offered a chance to be God is a great idea, and it is hilarious how this idea is brought to the screen with Jim Carrey being His Holiness for one week. There are some absolutely unmissable scenes that make for a riot of a viewing - check out the scene where Bruce gets his revenge on the gangsters. But the good thing about this film is that it manages to incorporate its outrageous moments into the plot - Bruce's abuse of the moon to impress his girlfriend leads to floods in Japan - very good attention to detail. This film is something special - it is, literally, a godsend. With a famous cast - Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman as God and Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's suffering girlfriend, this film has something for everyone, and numerous moments in this film hammer this fact home - all actions have consequences. If you were to become God one day, would you use your powers right? (Of course there's an absolutely fat chance of that, though it will be much more fun to visualise yourself as Him after you've seen this.)

I came to it with midling expectations, just hoping for some laughs at someone learning about the corruption of power and his own life.However,this movie actually made me mad. Not just disappointed that it wasn't good, or that I wasted two hours. It made me mad because I realized I was watching one big Latter Day Saints commercial (remember the ""who broke my window"" moralizing segments on TV?)I could accept the ""stop whining"", ""stop asking god to fix your life"" ... sort of message. However, this movie then preached the need to ""surrender your will to god"" and that you need to ""trust that god knows best about how your life should be"" - in other words the same old accept your place in life argument of many organized religions. A lecture about my need for blind faith in some supernatural being was NOT what I was looking for. I don't believe bad things happen for a ""good"" reason or as part of some larger plan and should just be accepted.Nor was it amusing to be preached to.I'm actually mad it was aired on TV. I'm mad it was made. I'm hoping Jim Carey & Morgan Freeman are ashamed they made it. And I'm annoyed they made a sequel (that I will avoid like a biblical plague).",Bruce Almighty
150,kyle-cruse,Actually better than you might expect,7,18 September 2008,"""Bruce Almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and ""be the miracle."" The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.*** out of ****",Bruce Almighty
151,David_Frames,There is no God,2,4 July 2003,"High Concept bulls***, peppered with Smaltz and a ruinous injection of sentimentality from Jim Carrey and the usual suspects. A one note premise for Carrey's familiar blend of hyperactive slapstick, gurning and shouting. Basically this is the script for Liar Liar with a different conceit. Once again through the course of the story Carrey redeems himself by realising whats really important and putting others first (Its the family stupid). Ahhhhhh. We're asked (again) to feel for the woman (this time Jennifer Aniston)who fell for this immature misfit but now realises hes not interested in a mature, responsible relationship. Well I say tough. They fell for him because he made them laugh of course, after all as God reminds Carrey in a scene saturated in back slapping egomania from the star in question, Carrey makes the whole world laugh - thats his gift. Oh yeah? Well God why isn't it working on me? I'd pay him $20M just to retire.Spending time with Jim Carrey in this kind of thing is like spending two hours in a public place with your highly embarrassing friend who insists on showing off and acting like a six year old. Your desperate to be somewhere else and during a film in which the jokes, hilarious stuff like urinating dogs and Monkeys exiting arses and so on, disappear 30 minutes before the end, I looked to the exit more than once and prayed for divine intervention - a lightning bolt hitting the projection room or something, which i'm sad to say never came. This kind of star vehicle by numbers is nothing short of the work of Satan himself and I encourage you to avoid it at all costs. Incidentally, and I don't suppose it matters, but should God necessarily be the Christian God by default in this picture? Isn't America a land of multiple faiths? Incidentally if you have faith I suggest you get on your knees tonight and pray for no more of this witless vapid sludge.

153,ilovedolby,The film lacks an element that audiences love Jim Carrey for-comedy.,6,2 June 2003,"After Jim Carrey's unsuccessful attempts to create a serious acting career with films like `The Majestic,' and `Man on the Moon,' he has decided to return to his old brand of slapstick humor in the new film `Bruce Almighty' from director Tom Shadyac (`Patch Adams'). Unfortunately, the film lacks an element that audiences love Jim Carrey for-comedy. The movie's highest points have already been seen in the trailers for the film. Ironically enough, audiences seemed most amused by those same jokes: the dog using the toilet, Carrey stepping in a pothole, etc. It just goes to show that most comic films are nothing more than rehashed, simple jokes, rather than something that is actually funny. `Bruce Almighty' is the story of a man named Bruce (Carrey), who hates his life. He's a reporter who gets the crap jobs at his station, and it seems like the whole world is ignoring his talents. His negative attitude is even starting to affect his relationship with his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). After loosing his job, Bruce starts to blame God for his lot in life. Low and behold, God (Morgan Freeman) shows up and gives Bruce all of his powers. Naturally, Bruce indulges in all the incredible abilities that God gives him and his life starts to improve. But what Bruce doesn't realize is that being God involves a lot more than improving his own life; he needs to help others who truly need it, as well. The plot is as trivial as they come. After about the first hour, some people may want to leave the theater. But things start to turn in favor of the film towards the last half-hour, as the film takes on a deeper, more meaningful tone. Ergo, the last thirty minutes of `Bruce Almighty' proves to be its own saving grace. Carrey is a great comedian, but one can't deny that the one-liners and old jokes are becoming boring. Instead of `alrighty then,' we now have `b-e-a-utiful.' The film isn't devoid of some original jokes, however. One scene shows Bruce on the rise in his ratings in which he earns the title 'Mr. Exclusive' because he finds the body of Jimmy Hoffa. Another scene shows Bruce doing an interview when all of a sudden, a meteor hits the earth in the background and since he's the only reporter around, the story becomes his. But when a film runs for 94 minutes and all it can depend on upon are moments of humor, it shows that someone should go back to the drawing board and start over. Shadyac is a fair director whose primary claim to fame have been comedies. Shadyac's `Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' was Carrey's first hit comedy, pushing him into the public eye. Shadyac's problem though is that all of his comic films are alike-they involve characters that are unhappy with their existence and through a blend of humor and emotion, they rise above themselves to become better people. Nevertheless, this scenario is old. If Shadyac wants to be remembered as a really good director, he needs to become more diverse in the film's he chooses. The only dramatic film that he's done to date has been 'Dragonfly' which starred Kevin Costner.`Bruce Almighty' has proven to be a big hit at the box-office. Perhaps most people just want the same thing over and over when they see a film. If this is what you are interested in, `Bruce Almighty' is the right ticket for you. If not, rent something that is actually funny like `Best in Show' or `The Naked Gun.'  **1/2",Bruce Almighty
154,MF210,Has some funny moments but is overall a mediocre film,5,30 November 2003,"My Rating: ** out of ****. Jim Carrey is one of the most consistently funny actor/comedian working today. He was hilarious in films like The Mask, Liar Liar, and Me Myself and Irene (to name a few). Such a hilarious performer would be welcomed in Bruce Almighty, but the Carrey that was in the films I named is not here.
Bruce Almighty has an interesting premise. What would you do if you were God? The film explores this and has one hilarious moment from exploring it. That scene deals with a news broadcaster. However, thats one of the few laughs you get from this movie. The movie is 100 minutes long and that is waaaaayyyyyyy too long. Jim Carrey is obviously not in top form here. His character is a brat and not very likable. Carrey does not seem to be enjoying what he is doing either. Jennifer Aniston has no chemistry with Carrey and does virtually nothing. No other actor really makes a difference either. Phillip Baker Hall is underused. Like Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty has an uneven script. The Comedy was strong in Liar but weak in the dramatic areas. Carrey took advantage of the comedy parts and was consistently hilarious. However, the comedy is not really strong here, its mostly stupid and not in a good way. The drama is horrible too, much worse than Liar. At the end, the screenwriters intended for us to feel sorry for Bruce. Bruce is a jerk and the ending was very corny.
The film also came off a bit selfish. Carrey's character was selfish but it was more than that. An interesting premise and one or two good laughs followed by a very weak script, uninspired performances, and an overlong running time do not mesh well.",Bruce Almighty
155,Gideon24,Carrey has definitely done better work,5,30 November 2015,"Jim Carrey's comic charisma almost makes 2003's Bruce Almighty sitting through...almost. But if you're a hardcore Carrey fan, your tolerance of this film could be a little higher.Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a TV anchorman who feels that everything in his life is turning to crap, triggered by the loss of a promotion to an obnoxious co-worker (Steve Carell), who starts being very vocal about the way God is ruining his life and that everything that has gone wrong in his life is because God is too busy to pay attention to him, which results in God (Morgan Freeman) appearing to Bruce and offering Bruce the challenge of running the world by transferring all of his powers to Bruce.Despite solid direction from Tom Shadyac, who also directed Carrey in Liar,Liar and Carrey's ability to make the most lame material funny, this film is about as predictable as they come, which includes Bruce's initial selfish use of the power he's been given, the abuse of the people in his life he cares about, and his eventual epiphany about how hard God's job really is.Carrey generates sporadic laughs, as does Steve Carrell as Evan Baxter, Carrey's obnoxious colleague and Nora Dunn as Carrey's boss, but Jennifer Aniston's role as Bruce's girlfriend, Grace, is thankless. The best thing about this movie is the classy presence of Morgan Freeman in the role of God. His performance alone makes this movie worth sitting through.

161,w00f,"Some Good Moments, But Uneven",6,23 May 2003,"""Bruce Almighty"" starts out as a comedy, and a very funny one at that.  The first half of this movie has many laugh out loud moments, and the news broadcast scene is one of the funniest five minutes of film shot in a long time.  I laughed so hard that I cried.Unfortunately, the movie gets too caught up in delivering its message in the last half.  The pacing slows to a crawl, and its stops being funny and starts being preachy.  We get speeches instead of laughs.  The ending is trite and it hurts the film.  The message is, in fact, a cliché.  There's nothing new or different about it.  It's been done so many times that one wonders why the director and writers feel the need to beat the audience over the head with it.Jim Carrey isn't nearly as over-the-top as he's been in the past.  His acting in this film is more like what he did in ""The Truman Show"" but with more of his physical humor.  Morgan Freeman as God is unconvincing.  His acting seems too hollow, and he just doesn't seem to be into the role. There's something missing from his performance.  Jennifer Aniston takes up space on the screen; there's not much to be said about her.  Any number of actresses could have been cast in the role of Bruce's girlfriend.If the movie had stuck to comedy and not tried to deliver its message in such a heavy-handed way it would have been a terrific film, and it's worth seeing just for the newsroom scene.  However, done the way it is, I give it 6 out of 10.  It's above average, but not by much.FOR ALL THE FUNDAMENTALISTS WORRIED ABOUT THIS FILM MOCKING GOD:  It doesn't do that.  In fact, it points out what a tough job an anthropomorphic deity has in dealing with the human race, that being God is no fun, and that humans aren't good substitutes for the real thing.  It does, however, beat us about the head for a good deal of the time that the idea of ""surrendering to God"" is a pointless thing to do, and in fact (SPOILER ALERT!), when Bruce does it, he gets run over by a truck.

He just can's accept the fact that he's an absolute bastard living a pretty nice life. Enter God, who teaches him a lesson about life by letting Bruce (Carrey) temp for him while he's off on vacation. Hilarity ensues.Bruce Almighty is essentially a mix of previous Carrey films Liar, Liar and The Mask. If you've seen those two, you can pretty much guess what's coming. Most of the time, Almighty is a horribly bad film. Carrey's manic tantrums and crazy antics were never that funny to begin with, and by now it's been done to death.The film is divided up into three parts: An introduction where we get to know (and hate) Bruce, a middle part where Bruce has fun with his powers, and a third part, where Bruce learns the errors of his ways and becomes a better person. The beginning is bad, the middle has some fun bits, and the end is half an hour of excruciating torture.Instead of entertaining, the film raises some questions. Does anybody want to see this kind of sappy endings, where the protagonist gets a moral education in order to become a better human being? What made Aniston's character Grace (see what they did with her name there?) fall in love with Bruce in the first place? Why are the effects so cheap looking? How much money did Morgan Freeman get to sign on for this mess? It's doubtful that this film would have been made if Carrey hadn't starred in it. It's just not funny.

Besides superb performances from Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman also delivers a compelling performance as God as in one of the most memorable scenes in the movie, he appears as the janitor,electrician and boss of the building Bruce goes to visit after receiving a mystery number that was paged to him but Steve Carrell's sort of short but memorable performance is one thing to look out for as well as Philip Baker Hall's character as Bruce's boss Jack Baylor.",Bruce Almighty
170,mrskywalker,Carrey's best,10,30 June 2003,Funny but meaningful story with secret referrals to movie history.  This is Frank Capra like with a very good story and not cynical.  Carrey shines through out.  This is great for all ages especially for believers.   This film could make you one.Carrey is himself here and you can see that the role is probably how he really acts in real life.  Comic talent shines here in this funny but sincere film.,Bruce Almighty
171,Sfpsycho415,"Best Carrey flick since Liar, Liar---7/10",7,1 June 2003,"Although i liked Liar, Liar a little more than Bruce Almighty, that doesn't make this a bad film. It is a hilarious comedy starring one of the funniest men alive. Jim Carrey stars as Bruce, a down on his luck news reporter who begins to blame God for all his misfortune. Then God contacts him and gives Bruce his powers to show him how hard being the master of the universe is. Jim Carrey is laugh out loud funny in this movie. His mix of physical comedy and comedic dialogue is great. Some of the funniest parts in the movie are scenes of him ranting about about how God ignores him or snapping on live television and insulting everyone. Morgan Freeman plays the man upstairs and Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's girlfriend. They both have some funny moments, but Carrey steals the show as always. 7/10",Bruce Almighty
172,Phil_H,Glad it wasn't me with the power,6,25 May 2003,"Occasionally, I've been known to utter things like ""If I were in charge,"" and I must admit the idea of power is appealing I will equally admit that I am not capable of handling such powers as Bruce is given in this movie. We're all very fortunate that it wasn't me.That being said, we could have done worse than have God imbue Bruce with omnipotence. Naturally, with Carrey, hilarity ensues. But there is a great, and important, message in ""Bruce Almighty,"" that being: be content and nobody (even God) is out to ""get you."" The idea that God would give such power to a mortal as a ""lesson"" is great, and mankind not being to worldly the sort of messed up things that happen are pretty plausible--even if it is a comedy. I don't see this as an attack on beliefs, and I don't see this as your average Jim Carrey movie either; it's a little bit more than that. And that makes it more worthy of viewing than any other Jim Carrey movie to date. Sufficiently so that I believe I can say this might be his best work (even more so than The Truman Show.)Solid ""6"" out of ""10."" There's a good story and it's pretty funny too. Check it out.",Bruce Almighty
173,thniels,Uninspired (or is that over-inspired?),5,6 July 2003,Jim Carrey is great in this type of movie but this type of movie reqires some sort of originality which this movie didn't have. The script writer should've stayed in bed or changed carrier or something along those lines. Expecting to see Jim Carrey at his best? Well I'm sure he is. Expecting to enjoy it too? Not this one!,Bruce Almighty
174,mwendel,Harmless Humor With Messages,6,28 January 2004,"In this movie we see a toned down version of Jim Carrey and some indication that he could actually have some true dramatic talent beyond his renowned comic antics.  In a nutshell, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) complains to the almighty until the almighty makes him the man in charge.  The movie depicts Nolan's (Carrey) ensuing reactions and behaviors for the next seven days after being put in charge.  The end results are chaotic and humorous.The movie also sends a strong messages that life is what you make it, look inside yourself for the answers to life's questions and all actions have consequences and you are the only one accountable for your decisions.  All which this reviewer believes are true and that I feel many people tend to lose site of in the hectic world we all live in.",Bruce Almighty
175,AzSumTuk,Just idiotic,2,9 July 2009,"Let me tell you something. I like Jim Carrey. I really do. I loved his performances in the Ace Ventura movies, I liked him in 'The Mask', he was great in 'The Truman Show'. I liked him even in 'Batman Forever'. I am not kidding. I think he is a very talented actor and could give us some great comedies. He has done it before. That is why I thought he could do it again. That is why I saw 'Bruce Almighty'. That was a big mistake. Really.The trailer was kind of impressive and the idea sounded very interesting when I heard about it for the first time - Bruce's life is miserable and Gods helps him by giving him the power to do everything. We expect some great humor, some interesting moral, something worth wasting time. What we are left with is just idiotic.I guess we were supposed to feel sorry about Bruce's miserable life. But how could I feel sorry about a man who acts like him? How can I feel sorry about a man who just refuses to show some control over his emotions? How can everyone feel sorry about a man who is losing everything just because he acts like an idiot and for no other reason? Then he got his Awesome Super Powers but instead of trying to do something real he just tried to take another man's job. First, I think this is like going shopping with an airplane, and second, the way he did it is really bothering me. He was causing natural disasters. I repeat it. He was causing natural disasters. He risked many people's lives just to become ""Mr. Exclusive""! And I am supposed to like this man?!?! Well, come on... Then he made all of his neighbors dreams come true. But what were their dreams? It was like all of them were dreaming about the same thing - winning the jackpot of the lottery. Well, come on. Again. People are different. Sometimes they dream about money, they want all of their problems to be solved, they dream about love... Somebody may dream about the death of his boss, other might want his neighbors to disappear magically because they annoy the hell out of him, other could beg for a date with Miss Universe... Where were that kind of dreams? The other problem with the character of Bruce is Jim Carrey. That's right. He is overacting all the time. It was like the director was constantly asleep and there was nobody to tell Carrey something like ""Hey, man, ACT NORMAL FOR JUST A FEW GOD D**N SECONDS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!!!"". Even when Bruce was supposed to be normal Carrey was not. I know, he does the same thing in all of his comedies but has never been so annoying. Never. There were, of course, other important problems. We were supposed to think Evan is an a$$****. That's what one of the characters said. But why? He didn't do anything bad. Anything. He was just better reporter than Bruce and that's why he got the job. Yet after Bruce got his power he humiliated him in front of the cameras. That was mean. Like... Like Bruce was taking his revenge for the fact that Evan is a better human being than him. And Morgan Freeman... Don't get me wrong, I like him. I think he could play even a piece of wood and make it a great role but his character here was... Just nothing. They could have had anybody for this role with absolutely no difference. The same thing could be said about Jeniffer Anniston. She was just pathetic. And there were just no other characters. Well, I will stop here. I still think the idea was interesting and could be great for a good dramatic movie. That's why I am not giving 'Bruce Almighty' 1/10.",Bruce Almighty
176,v_kumar3@yahoo.com,Bruce Almighty,6,23 June 2020,"When you have a star cast asJim Carrey, Jennifer Anniston, Morgan Freeman playing as supernatural God, we may expect some hijinks.

177,AmyJenson1995,Jim Almighty,9,6 May 2015,"If God would confide you his Mighty Power, what would you do? Who never ask himself or herself that question at some part of our life? Jim Carrey is playing Bruce Nolan, a reporter working for Eyewitness News, a Buffalo TV station. He has everything to be happy: he has a nice job, is appreciated by the entire community and his girlfriend. But when the anchorman position becomes available, Bruce got frustrated because his main competition, Evan Baxter (Played by Steve Carell), arrogant as hell, is collecting the good stories and sweeps while he is doing the low grade ones and he's making a fool of himself at each of the stories he's going through. So when Evan is officially promoted to Anchorman while Bruce is doing a live feed, Bruce loses it completely and get fired. The same evening he crashes his car into a light pole and as angry as he can get, blames God for all his misadventures. God, exceeded by all the critic and blame he got from Bruce, decides to challenge Bruce to do a better job than he does. Discovering unwillingly his new powers, Bruce starts to use them to get his life better. But soon, he also have to deal with the other aspects of God life and understands progressively that Being God seems much harder than it looks.The main source of fun in this movie is not the plot himself but Jim Carrey himself. It's just a pleasure to see him using God's power against the people around him or in various aspects of his own life. This role was made for Jim Carrey and his craziness. We can see how much fun he took playing Bruce Nolan and he literally is carrying this movie on his shoulders. There are several memorable scenes which just make you laugh to tears. It's hard to not laugh watching this movie, really hard!",Bruce Almighty
178,deadsenator,Yikes! One of Carey's worst. - 4 of 10,4,21 June 2003,"I can't recommend this film.  Sure, it's got some laughs, but overall the plot is rife with holes.  Carey yucks it up some of the time, but it ain't enough to Carey this turkey!  Aniston and Carey are NOT a good on-screen couple and the prime drive of the film end up a love story.  I don't think so.  Ug, I could go on with all the problems with the plot, but why bother. See for yourself, if you like.  You'll laugh a time or two, but in the end, you'll wonder why Carey didn't do X number of other things while he was God. Then you'll stop by a church on the way home just to pray since they drilled this into your head at the end.  Eck, 4 of 10.",Bruce Almighty
179,Mr_PCM,Comedic but Christian!,8,15 March 2012,"After experimenting with more serious roles and flirting with critical acclaim in films such as 'The Truman Show' and 'Man On The Moon', Jim Carrey made a (relatively) toned-down return to comedy with this 2003 smash, showing flashes of the comic brilliance that made 'The Mask' and 'Ace Ventura' such massive hits. Bruce Almighty is at once a simple but also potentially tricky premise; a downtrodden journalist (Carrey) complains one too many times about God's role in his life, and is thus imbued with all the powers of the Creator – along with all the hitherto unconsidered responsibility that goes with it. What follows is a film along the well-trodden typical rom-com path; jokes, puns and sight gags for the first half, before giving way to more serious stuff. As a result, partly due to the weighty subject matter, Bruce Almighty gets somewhat bogged down at the halfway point by questions of morality and philosophy as well as the usual relationship issues, which causes the film to drag and sit heavy before returning to the path to the ending.So, what would it be like to be God? Serious question! Fortunately, thanks to Carrey's presence, there are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments (in between typical gags of sledgehammer subtlety), as the lead is given the opportunity to wisecrack, gurn and impress as only Jim Carrey can, while still pulling off the hangdog everyman he perfected as Stanley Ipkiss. There is enough zing in Carrey's performance to remind viewers of his similarity to a young Robin Williams – fortunately minus the Chewbacca-esque body hair! Meanwhile, even in comedy, Morgan Freeman still exudes the same air of confidence, trustworthiness and gravitas that typifies all his roles, thus adding credibility to possibly the most impossible role of all: God. Yet, after his convincing turn as the President of the USA (Deep Impact) several years previously, it seemed like a logical career progression. And would you really want anyone else as the Alpha and Omega? As it turns out, Freeman is given little do but play straight man to Carrey's funny man, yet he still manages to steal the film from right under the lead's nose, all the while occasionally espousing pseudo-moral message. Plus, he wears a sharp suit so slick he makes Humphrey Bogart's Rick look downright shabby! As always, Jennifer Aniston isn't taxed in her role, playing her usual variation on 'Rachel from Friends' - sweet, lovable and attractive but with little more depth than a kiddies' paddling pool! But then, why would they? It's Carrey's show.However, where the film seriously starts to falter is when the 'com' portion of the film takes a back seat to allow the 'rom' portion to take the wheel. In a typical rom-com this would be predictable but acceptably sappy, but with the added questions of personal responsibility and morality – something not new to Carrey films (Liar Liar). Add that to the film's skirting around the edges of religious questions such as the existence and power of God, and no wonder the film is used in R.E. lessons up and down the country! But, if you can forgive the occasional holier-than-thou message which sometimes veers into outright preaching, what you have is a classic Carrey comedy that can be easily enjoyed.Just try to see it as a film, not a sermon!",Bruce Almighty
180,qball_82,The formulaic Carrey vehicle.,7,26 June 2003,"Typical Carrey fare - he gets to pull faces, contort his body in numerous ways and make bizarre noises.  It provides an enjoyable hour-and-forty minutes worth of viewing with some great laughs (ironically the star didn't get any from me), although it does seem to ""run out of puff"" toward the end.  This is pretty much an 'everyone' kind of film.  Definitely recommended for the Carrey buffs but even just the every-movie person.  Worth catching on the big screen.",Bruce Almighty
181,Mitch-25,One of Carrey's better movies,9,29 May 2003,"I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan.  I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura.  I also like him in his serious movies, especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between his VERY funny side, and his serious side.  He is of course VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease.  he is truely a multi-function actor.As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston's acting.  I think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass.  Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God.  As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene.Overall, I would have to rate this a 9.  Good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good film.",Bruce Almighty
182,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Bruce Almighty,8,23 May 2003,"It is amazing knowing that Jim Carey has not had a new comedy, intended for the young adult crowd, in about three years. The man who was once declared a king of comedy seems to go through a bit of a dry spot in his career. Me, Myself & Irene was not the big hit everybody expected it to be especially from the directors of There's Something About Mary while his dramatic performance in The Majestic was critically hailed but the film itself was a big flop at the box office. Though he had his failures in the past four years, Carrey found success in the family hit, The Grinch. Now after some time off, Carrey returns to the comedy scene looking in top form. This time around he takes on the role of a man who thinks he can do a better job at being God then the big man himself. The question is, though, will this film do a better job then Carrey's previous misses or will his trend of failure continue?The story goes that a man named Bruce Nolan is miserable and unhappy with his life. Granted, yes, he does look to have a pretty average life with a beautiful girlfriend, a good apartment and a steady job but he is going nowhere in his life. As a human interest story reporter, Bruce is passed on promotion after promotion which are given to people that flaunt it in his face. And whenever he tries to do something nice for somebody, like helping a homeless man on the street, bad things happen because of it. Continuous bad luck drives Bruce to the breaking point and he calls upon God himself. He shouts that God is not doing his job and claims he could do a better. Hearing his shouts, he gives Bruce the opportunity almost anybody would love to have: To be God and have all his powers. There are just two rules that come with this power: First, Bruce can't tell anybody he is God, and second, he can't affect a person's free will. Will Bruce help the poor and unfortunate? Sure, after he straightens his life out first, which could take awhile. The story of Bruce Almighty is pretty good though it is not completely perfect. The film does tend to slow down quite a bit in parts of the film which can be a problem for the overall effect.
The cast of Bruce Almighty is pretty good for the most part. Jim Carrey is once again in top form as the lead character in the film. Carrey's dramatic emotions like he used in films like The Majestic actually come into use in parts of the film when serious issues are dealt with. The fact that Carrey can be so fun and then change unnoticeably into a serious state makes him an outstanding actor that is rarely seen in comedy today. Morgan Freeman is the perfect fit as God. Freeman, who has appeared in such dramatic films as Deep Impact and The Sum of All Fears, has rarely been seen in a comedy especially with the likes of Jim Carrey but he pulls the role off perfectly. Freeman's comic timing is so perfect that you wouldn't believe that he hasn't performed in many comedies. Hopefully the film's success will give him more reason to test the genre. The only real problem with the cast would be Jennifer Aniston. Granted she does look pretty in the film and presents some emotion in the film, she really does show any exceptional acting talent. For most of the film either she is crying or showing no emotion what-so-ever. She really doesn't present something to the character that the audience hasn't seen before or different from her character on Friends. Perhaps she should just stick with roles like The Good Girl, which was a critical success for her, because her comedic acting is not anything to laugh at.Overall, Bruce Almighty is another good comedic popcorn flick but nothing extraordinary. There are too many small problems that plague the film to give it huge approval. The story is good but like it was said earlier, it is not spectacular. There are many funny elements within the course of the film but the story strays into too many moments where it just falls flat while the audience waits for the next hilarious moment to appear. While talking on the subject of jokes, when is Carrey going to get off the fart and potty humor to get laughs. There are a lot of moments where he uses witty lines and such to make the audience laugh but then later in the film strays into making fart noises interrupting a news anchor. Another problem with the plot of the film is that when it does go to the serious moments, it becomes way too sappy and pushes away a lot of the audience that just came for the comedy. If you have seen any romantic comedy before this film, you basically know how it ends. Most of the film is too predictable which sort of hurts it. Not to say the film is not funny. Jim Carrey saves the day for most of the film while Morgan Freeman helps with his rarely seen comedic whit. Bruce Almighty doesn't even come close to The Matrix Reloaded but does give some laughs for those too young to see the big hit sequel.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B)",Bruce Almighty
183,tomb_92,"A really well written piece that conveys some important messages, and very funny",9,23 February 2010,"I like some of Tom Shadyac's previous work, I loved The Nutty Professor and Liar Liar, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was enjoyable. Of course Even Almighty, which followed this film was no-where near as good as any of these. Jim Carrey is one of my favourite actors, but Bruce Almighty sees him in one of his finest roles. I always maintained that he is a fine actor, verging on the genius (especially in comic-value). Morgan Freeman was also brilliant to watch in this, he was the wise Lord of all, with a sense of humour. Together with these terrific performances is a really well written script which not only has some really prominent things to say about religion and faith, but also about relationships and about ourselves. At the end of the day the film is very humbling, especially as we see Carrey's character develop. Jennifer Aniston normally annoys me, but I feel she gives a good performance in this, Steve Carell can also be annoying, but it fits his character here. And the thing that amazes me most is that it gets the balance perfectly- it still manages to get all its points across whilst still being very, very funny.",Bruce Almighty
184,Ryu_Darkwood,"Funny comedy, despite its religious undertone",7,8 July 2007,"I'm not really a religious person and I certainly don't like it if Western film makers put a clearly visible Christian message in their movies. This being said, I must say that I wasn't annoyed by ''Bruce Almighty''. Though its intent is clearly to make people feel more positive about Christianity and their God, it does have enough funny jokes in it and a decent enough storyline for a broad public. Even an atheistic person as myself can enjoy this charming movie. Jim Carrey gives a perfect performance as the loser that's blaming God for his misfortune, not using his plastic face that often to generate some cheap laughs. Jennifer Aniston is, well...Jennifer Aniston. I loved Morgan Freeman's God as the wise father figure with a cruel sense of humor.",Bruce Almighty

187,raymond-massart,A rather entertaining movie,6,2 February 2004,"Why does it seem so difficult in this day and age to make a movie which aims at amusing an audience by means of good innocent fun? Fun has tended to become obsolete in present day motion pictures and any attempt at restoring light-hearted amusement should be encouraged. Bruce Almighty gives us a great feeling from the very beginning on: it's opening scenes are very promising and we get the impression that this is going to be a worthy sequel to movies such as ""Mask"": fast and hilarious.All this is relatively true:some great gags and visual virtuosity right up to the moment God points out to Bruce that he's basically an irresponsible and unworthy human being.After this moral reprimand, Bruce is never the same any more and neither is the movie. It slumps, becomes sluggish and loses its appeal. A real pity as both Jim and Morgan were seemingly enjoying themselves immensely up until the moment the script really let them down. All in all a rather entertaining movie",Bruce Almighty
188,GHCool,GOOD film,7,26 May 2003,"After a slow beginning, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say.  It wasn't one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still OK.  Morgan Freeman was just right as God.  Jennifer Aniston had some good moments.  I miss Steve Correll on ""THE DAILY SHOW!""I like director Tom Shadyac's choices of movies.  He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.  In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him.  A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie.  My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people.  That's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.My Grade:7 out of 10",Bruce Almighty

Let's put it this way.

I'll explain why it is terribly flawed, even though it made several hundred million dollars:-I am not a Jim Carrey hater, but he was totally miscast for this role. You needed more of a straight man to pull off the transformation to having the powers of God. Instead, Carrey seems only mildly different from before.-The movie was for some reason set in Buffalo, but it looks to have been mostly filmed on a back lot in southern California. This was very disconcerting to me - Buffalo is a very gritty, post-industrial landscape, and blue screening a few shots of the skyline or the falls doesnt make it. And that street set looked like something out of ""Singin' in the Rain"".-It had no edge, despite the whole work conflict and breakup with Anniston's character. An edge would provide better contrasts and better comedy - instead, it comes across like a rated G film with a few sexy jokes.Only good thing was Morgan Freeman.",Bruce Almighty

Now if something (anything) happened that I didn't expect, then it could have been a really really good movie. Oh well. If you like Jim Carry or ""Friends"" then you will like the movie.

If done as straight drama, it would have been an ingenious way to show how tough it is for God to exist and answer our prayers, while not interfering in free will. If done as a straight comedy, it would have been very smart in offering tons of gags about changing people's lives. Putting the two concepts together weakens the movie.

197,Clive-Silas,"The guts of this movie were ripped out - see how in the ""Deleted Scenes""",4,2 February 2004,"Obviously we've seen this kind of movie before - the hook here is Jim Carrey and how his manic persona handles the responsibility of infinite power. Unfortunately the one bit of true Carrey-fication is the one you've all seen in the trailers where he mimes ""I've Got The Power"" and sets off the fire hydrant.This film resolutely steers away from exploring even the tiniest potential in the ordinary Joe who is given the powers of God. I was shocked when I realised that the entire movie was going to more or less be about Bruce and his relationship with girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston).The structure and story arc made no sense; the first thing Bruce does with his Godlike powers is engineer a night of superb lovemaking, but there was no hint that this was a problem between him and Grace. When Grace and her sister start talking about how ""tonight's the night"" that Bruce will propose, you wonder if Bruce is actually in the same movie, since a reluctance or otherwise to commit to Grace was completely absent from his characterisation. When their date turns out to be the most romantic dinner in the world, you the viewer know that it is in the way of these things that he isn't going to propose, but you are left mystified as to why, and when it transpires that it is all just to announce that he got the Anchor job you are left feeling that Carrey has suddenly turned Bruce into a completely different character. Later on in the movie Grace rounds on him and sarcastically yells that what she wants is a ""Boat, and sacks of cash"". This is puzzling because he had not manifested any particular materialistic tendencies around Grace - we didn't even know if she had seen the flash new sports car he was driving. And why was the only apparent consequence to answering everybody's prayers in the affirmative being everybody winning the lottery, ending up with $17 each? Surely a high school kid would have written a few more scenarios into a script about an omnipotent guy?However upon viewing the Extras on the DVD, we discover that a lot of this important stuff was contained within scenes which were deleted before release. The restaurant scene actually ended with Grace berating Bruce and pointing out that she had been waiting for a proposal; subsequently there was a scene in which he took her to a mansion he had created for them, in the car he was now showing off - setting up Grace's sarcasm later on. It has to be said that the mansion scene in particular was poorly thought through and unconvincing - he just got a promotion at work and now he can afford a multimillionaire mansion? And she ""buys"" it? On the other hand, there should have been *something* in its place. All those prayer consequences had been shot, but were cut ""for pacing"" (although it may have been to eliminate a plot hole - God shows him the bad consequence of one decision which is actually down to God's foreknowledge of what would have happened if Bruce Almighty hadn't intervened; but if Bruce has *all* God's powers, then presumably he would already know this?) The director's commentary on the deleted scenes reveals director Tom Shadyac to be two things: talentless and spineless. If he wasn't cutting essential plot scenes for pacing, he was doing so because ""Jim was coming across too dark, and preview audiences didn't like it"", or ""We were worried that people might get offended."" For heaven's sake, Tom, any director worth his salt would at least *pretend* that these changes were forced on him by the studio, instead of on his own initiative having gone out of his way to make his own movie suckier. One consequence of this cutting was to dramatically weaken Grace as a character, leaving Jennifer Aniston completely wasted.Morgan Freeman as usual is just money in the bank. There is nobody you'd rather have play God, but it is a shame to see it happen in this movie. Carrey does his manic facial act with no context other than that it's Jim Carrey so you expect it of him. In the outtakes his crazy mugging has the whole crew in stitches, and you can't help feel that they must be laughing because he's the star. That consummate professional Jennifer Aniston scarcely cracks a smile during these events, I notice, particularly when Carrey practically molests her while making his silly face. And Carrey can't do schmaltzy redemption, upon which at least a third of the movie relies, to save his life.One final point - every visual aspect of this film screams Los Angeles and Southern California, even to a Brit like myself. There is not the slightest feeling that this movie is supposed to take place in northern New York State.",Bruce Almighty
198,MyOpinionIsFact,Interesting watch,7,19 December 2003,"This movie starts off bad. I'd say it was well-below average for the first quarter. By mid-way through, it was growing on me and by the end I was really caught up in it (to the point of almost tearing up in one scene!).I will say this: watch the DVD extras! Some of them are extremely funny. I laughed harder at them than during the movie. There are also some good scenes that didn't make the final cut (because they didn't fit in with the rest of the movie but work by themselves). Take for instance the report where Carrey is dressed-up as Mark Twain -- I was rolling.",Bruce Almighty
199,stiva,A movie for entire family and mankind...,8,10 January 2008,"Honestly, I don't believe in God's existence. But, I believe in the message this trying tell us.This is quite a remarkable movie in a nutshell. The story is simple. A man having bad luck one after the other. He really gets angry on the God. The God (Morgan Freeman) comes to him in human form, hand him his powers to see whether he can do the job better than him. In the end, he understands the true meaning of life.Bruce (Jim Carrey) at his best as usual. The scene where Bruce makes Evan Baxter read the news is the best. I was literally in tears and laughing my ass off. This is a very good comedy movie for an entire family to watch. Morgan Freeman as God also did a splendid job. He was perfect for the role. This movie not just has humor alone. It has a very good message. The people around us in this world were so absorbed into their own things and money and jobs and so on, but forgot to feel their inner nature, humanity. But, it's about humanity. Caring for others. Put the others in front of you. It deals with mankind. Bruce might have a job he doesn't like, but, instead he has something he likes more than his own life, Grace (Jenifer Aniston).I would recommend this movie if you haven't seen it. It's a very good very movie and is going to come into my personal collection.",Bruce Almighty
200,elu5iv3,"Disappointing, but okay...",5,4 July 2003,"Bruce Almighty: 5/10I'm a big Jim Carrey fan, so decided to see this the day after opening. The concept was cool, Jim Carrey with the power of God! The execution... not so good. The heights of this movie were TREMENDOUS, I was nearly in tears of laughter at points. But like Just Married (only this was better), there were times where I didn't laugh for a long time, and was so of passively entertained, but not outright enjoying it. With a stronger script, this could have been a classic comedy, because whenever he was given something good, he ran with it and made me laugh hard. Morgan Freeman is typically good, playing a comedic God. Special mention has to go out to Jennifer Aniston for the wrong reasons, as they was absolutely atrocious as Carrey's wife in the movie, coming across as phony with her whiny tone. Overall, it was an okay flick, but very disappointing.",Bruce Almighty
201,bluzman,Suprisingly Good Fun,7,24 May 2003,"I went to this movie with modest expectation of a few good Jim Carrey laughs and stunts.  I was surprised to find a very entertaining movie with a fair enough story line and some good lessons in life.Jim Carrey was, as expected, funny, spontaneous and unpredictable. I wanted that and was satisfied.  The big surprise was Morgan Freeman as God.  I am not sure whose idea it was to court and land him for this role, but it was genius.  This was so far from his normal role, yet a perfect fit.  He was wonderful.  However, at the same time, I could here the redneck bible belt panicking and the state of Utah flipping out at the notion of God being anything but that lily white guy we always see depicted.Jennifer Aniston, dolly that she is, was often lost in the mix.  However, she did get off a few good licks.All in all, I had a really good time and a very glad I saw it.  definite thumbs up with a bullet, star or whatever you prefer.",Bruce Almighty
202,Workin_Man,The Best Jim Carrey Film To Date,10,26 February 2006,"Bruce Almighty is hilarious. It is by far the funniest movie of 2003. Jim Carrey is absolutely priceless in this one. He is by far the funniest person on the planet right now. His movies are always entertaining and fun to watch.Anyways, more of this movie. The scene where Bruce Nolan makes Evan Baxter talk like a blabbering idiot just brought me to tears. It was so funny! That scene is the work of a genius. The acting in that scene was excellent by the way! Actually the whole movie had great acting.In general, this movie was great. It had great acting, genius comedy, and it was just really fun to watch. I will definitely be watching this again and again. Bruce Almighty will become a classic movie no doubt. It will be a classic for at least another 50 years.10/10",Bruce Almighty

Then I saw it and it wasn't half bad. I actually liked it. Jim Carrey, who I'm not that big of a fan of, did a great ob. He's wacked out and crazy in this movie just like all the others. But unlike all the others I didn't feel that he went over the top. Sure there times that he was really wacked out. But I thought that he stayed true to the character that he was playing. And I'm glad that they didn't make it were everything was perfect just cause he was God, cause even though God has the power to do so, he gave us the freedom to make our own choices so I'm glad they stuck with that. I thought all the actors did a good ob and even though working with Carrey they did a wonderful ob staying in control and character. The bloopers are always fun to watch though.",Bruce Almighty
204,ivony,Predictable but enjoyable,6,29 May 2003,"Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan who is leading the average life. However, he wants more:  better apartment, better job, better car, etc. and basically blames God for his mediocrity.  God answers Bruce's call and gives him the chance to be ""Bruce Almighty"", thus taking over the responsibilities of God.  It's not long before Bruce realizes God's work isn't as easy as he thought.While it's true that many funny scenes were given away during the trailers, that didn't detract from the overall enjoyment derived from the movie.  And although Bruce Almighty is not a laugh-a-minute, it does have it's hilarious moments.  However, coupled with the humor is a more serious and heartfelt message which is delivered unoffensively and without being over the top. I'd say the only real drawback for me was the predictability of this movie. But even with the predictability, the movie was no less enjoyable and worth watching.As for the acting, Jim Carrey did a splendid job as being jerky, rude, whiney, pitiful, kind and caring all in one.  Furthermore, it's quite nice to see his ability to do more serious work shine through with the necessary bits of comedic relief.All in all, Bruce Almighty is a movie I would recommend...especially if you enjoy comedy with a side of serious.  I give Bruce Almighty a 7 out of 10.",Bruce Almighty
205,drunken_critic,Bruce Campbell Almighty,7,21 November 2003,"Was this part 4 of the Evil Dead series?  Throughout the film I kept thinking that it was shot in the same style as early Sam Raimi work.  The action was fast paced and cartoonish like Dark Man and Evil Dead.  I think this movie should have been called Bruce Campbell Almighty.  Jim Carrey who played Bruce must have watched Evil Dead for inspirational acting ideas. His character had the same manic personality as Bruce Campbell.
This movie started out great.  Bruce's life is not going very well.  He keeps blaming his problems on God's spite.  He loses his job, but is nice enough to help a homeless person in need.  He gets an offer by God played by Morgan Freeman to do his work.  Gods reasoning is that he needs a vacation. This means he will have God's power.  The best and funniest scenes of the movie take place when Bruce uses the power for his own amusement.  He makes his girlfriend's breast bigger, he makes her horny, he gets a sportcar, and uses his power to sabotage his enemies.  The first part of the movie was funny, but then comes script block.  The second part of the movie felt stagnant.  It involves him becoming depressed because his girlfriend leaves him, and he wants to use his powers for only `good'.  I was disappointed that it started out so funny and zany, but ended up trying to prove that God's power is too much for a mere mortal.  I think this would have been a great movie if it kept up the fast paced tempo that it had in the beginning. The director seemed scared to make a movie with no point.  It would have been better if he kept the movie irrelevant.  At the end it had the corny happy Hollywood ending.  Why not have Bruce stay happy with the powers of God?  Is it too morally wrong and unethical to think that maybe a mere mortal human could handle great powers?  I personally would have liked to have seen him handle the powers without any problems.  It ended up being a cliché.  He was given the power, but he could not handle it.  Too bad, I could have handled it!  But then again I am the drunken critic. 7/10",Bruce Almighty
206,tramsbottom,Some hilarity but far from a classic,7,3 July 2003,"Much as I like Jim Carrey, isn't he getting a bit old for this?  Pulling faces at 40 just highlights his wrinkles.On the other hand there is a childish delight at seeing Ace Ventura: TV Reporter.  The film takes a while to get going and some of Carrey's mugging smacks of overkill (or maybe desperation), but when Bruce Almighty gets the jokes right... boy does it work.  Witness Bruce influencing a rival TV man to speak in a squeaky voice during the news, or Bruce's breakdown and use of the F-word live on air.  Morgan Freeman has some fun with the role of God, but when the film stumbles under its own theological weight and turns semi-serious in the third act, things become predictable and stale when you just want Carrey to do something funny.  Aniston's role is underwritten to say the least.Bruce Almighty has some laugh out loud moments, but it's no classic.  Oh well - at least it's better than Shadyac's last two films.",Bruce Almighty
207,jerome_horwitz,Too typical for Jim Carrey in 2003,4,22 February 2005,"First I'd like to say, I'm a huge Jim Carrey guy. Since In Living Color I always thought he portrayed some excellent characters and is very funny.However, Bruce Almighty really just seems like a culmination of the last few movies Carrey has done. He's an antagonist and protagonist, all in the same movie.The gist of the movie is God switches place with Carrey, then leaving him in charge of everything I guess. This even includes answering prayers. Of course Carrey is overwhelmed by all the responsibilities he never realized that God has.Morgan Freeman plays God, and is excellent as always in this supporting role (will we ever see him as the star?). If there was anything very enjoyable, it's Freeman's presence on the screen for short times that occurs.What happens during the course of Carrey being God is just too typical. Yes, some of it's funny, but really it's just kind of average. For example he 'splits the red sea', he poofs in himself a race car, and he get's his news casting nemesis busted for possession of several pounds of pot. You know, all the stuff we would do if we were God.Unfortunately the typicalness continues throughout the movie. For example the 'now for Carrey' obligatory rain scene too common in Carrey's movies these days (The Majestic, The Truman Show, etc.).I found ""The Majestic"" a much more refreshing movie. As for this movie, I really think we've seen a better Carrey-god character in ""The Mask"". I'm sure Carrey liked this role, but to me as a fan it just seems like another giant paycheck for an underwhelming effort. 4/10 (maybe 4.5)",Bruce Almighty

210,schmimic,Jim Carrey delivers his trademark antics in this little comedy gem about the responsibility of playing God.,9,23 April 2005,"Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore.Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low down.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)",Bruce Almighty
211,ClarusTheDogCow,Average Movie,7,2 June 2003,"Bruce Almighty was pretty much an average movie.. Jim Carrey was his usual goofy self.  I don't think it was worth the $8 to see, a $4 movie rental charge seems more appropriate.The whole religious thing was obviously a mockery of more orthodox religions.  It was boring that Hollywood used the typical stereotypes of God and his surroundings... white light, clean, and of course the utter disregard for the laws of physics.  This movie is a no-brainer.. meaning, it doesn't involve much mental activity to watch.. It was funny though and that is always a good thing!7/10.",Bruce Almighty
212,mikel weisser,The film you saw isn't nearly as good as the one they cut,8,31 May 2004,"Sometimes watching the deleted scenes on the DVD of a movie leaves you hankering for the film that could have been and suddenly disappointed with the film you had thought you liked. Like the DVD for John Dahl's ""Joyride""(2001), the DVD package for Tom Shadyac's ""Bruce Almighty"" reveals a whole other movie that was shot, but underperformed at the test screenings and got chopped down to a simplistic version of itself. Don't be confused, ""Bruce"" still amply earns it's 8 of 10 rating and that's an 8 tending toward 9 due to the reasonable attempt to discuss philosophical issues amid Jim Carrey's rubber faced mugging and fart jokes. The plot: ""what would happen if you got to/had to be God?"" is rife with possibilities and the finished film reels like a Marx Brothers telegraph of a Tolstoy novel. Pretty darn good, but Oh what could have been. Watch the deleted scenes and the ""Method of Jim"" reels on the extras portion of the DVD then pause to imagine the film that ""Bruce Almighty"" was before ""Shady-hack"" went to chopping. It's an editing job that trades divine for dividend.",Bruce Almighty
213,noelcox,unqualified rubbish,1,26 September 2003,"Doubtless fans of the title actor will disagree, but I couldn't find any redeeming features in this film. What starts with an interesting subject (a man given unlimited powers by God) - if we ignore the far superior ""Man who could work miracles"" by HG Wells, which pre-dates this trash by a hundred years - becomes an excuse for 'jokes' and the crudest humor.
But ultimately what disturbed me was that the moral seemed to be that Bruce himself was free to exercise his 'God-given' powers for his own amusement or to better his own life. Is mankind so enfeebled that it never occurs to the character - except in a token and perfunctory moment - to actually do good with his newly acquired omnipotence?",Bruce Almighty
214,eternalsea,Enjoyable Carrey romp,7,2 April 2006,"Bruce Almighty is exactly what you would expect from a Jim Carrey movie.Silly. It builds itself around Carrey and his arsenal of stupid expressions with the occasional laugh out loud joke and the occasional awful one. Carrey plays Bruce a news reporter who thinks God has a personal vendetta against him. However after all Bruces whining God, who is expertly played by Morgan Freeman has had enough. He grants Bruce all his powers for a period of time so Bruce can correct all the wrongs he ""thinks"" are in the world. The supporting cast throughout the film is a mixed bag with Steve Carrell on awesome form as Bruces enemy at the work place, but Jennifer Aniston is not convincing as Bruces long time suffering girlfriend. As for Carrey himself well he plays the same role he always does, that of the flawed but lovable goon. He is effective but if Carrey isn't careful he will kill that character and that could seriously effect his future in the industry. The jokes keep a smile on your face and make the experience of watching the film enjoyable, but there just simply aren't enough gut busters in the script to keep this film long in your memory. To conclude Bruce Almighty is a decent film, but not one worthy of purchasing on DVD are making a sequel to.",Bruce Almighty
215,biba_yu,What is the message here...again? Anyone?,3,11 April 2005,"When I read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a God, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, I though that was clever and original concept. Casting was promising too, Carrey, Freeman, Aniston... How can movie with a good idea and good actors, not to mention costs of filming, can be bad? It can. Idea is good, but script and story itself is terrible. Bruce Nolan is, let's be honest, a pretty mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story of a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the Niagara report is complete fiasco!), he's a man with a job he completely DESERVES (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and OH HORROR!!!! Dog who is not house trained!!! Yes, as soon as Bruce, at the beginning of the movie starts addressing GOd in a ""God, why do you hate me!"" manner, average viewer must think: ""Why, what's wrong with your life, Bruce?"". Bruce is not, and definitely NOT the man with real problems in life. Most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes, and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity. Most people have really big problems, worth of attention, most people are more worth of attention that Bruce, who doesn't seem too human after all, doesn't look even realistic, too goofy and neurotic, but God still addresses to him. Why? Though Morgan Freeman looks nice as a God, I can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie. And what does Bruce do when God gives him his powers? God in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference. No, wait, a smart kid would probably use his God powers better than Bruce. What does Bruce do? Pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!! No more, Bruce, please! What Bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie, that doesn't happen, because this is ""nice, family, little movie"" and doesn't make any sense at all!!! Not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!! Nothing. Just Carrey playing silly, which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor. Aniston here is understated. She plays pale, undeveloped character of Bruce's girlfriend Grace, and stays completely forgettable in this movie. Nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them. When Grace says prayer for Bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely false. These two are not meant to be together. I would give three stars, but I doubt movie deserves a one. Bad script, lame dialogs, lack of real humor, wittiness and any sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated Freeman's and Aniston's roles, total lack of boldness and sarcasm, it all makes movie hardly worth ***. But OK, there were few funny moments, and Freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars.",Bruce Almighty

219,Oliver-50,How the mighty has fallen,2,22 November 2003,"Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. Or, in the case of 'Liar Liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show.' The guy is remarkable.Then comes 'Bruce Almighty,' an ideal vehicle for Carrey, and a premise that should have worked; Carrey, after complaining about God and how his life stinks, is enabled with God's powers. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad a script is, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. He seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it's really just annoying.I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends' and she was superb in last year's 'The Good Girl.' She too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.'Bruce Almighty' should have been a comedy that works. But it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. A few minor giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails on nearly every level. That's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it's close. Any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems. But hey, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it.",Bruce Almighty
220,FranktheRabbit,...And the Lord did grin...,6,20 December 2003,"`Bruce Almighty' (2003/Tom Shadyac) **1/2 out of ****Many people (myself included), at one time or another, wish that we could obtain the powers of God himself. And that is the concept of `Bruce Almighty'. A wacky TV reporter, who is trying to take his career seriously, while his life seems to be going down hill, gets the opportunity to use God's powers to see if he could do a better job. But, like most `what if?' comedies, this film runs out of steam before too long, and the ending is as satisfying as one might hope for.Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a good reporter, he just is not taken seriously. So when he loses the big promotion (and his job), and gets the shit beaten out of him in the same day, he starts to lose his faith in the big guy upstairs. And who could blame him? But then, he gets a visit from someone he never would have expected.GOD (played by Morgan Freeman). Then, for the next few weeks or so, he gets to take God's place while he takes a vacation. What follows is a sometimes funny, sometimes routine comedy that does not add up. But part of if it is fun. Especially when in references `Dirty Harry', and when Nolan takes revenge on the people that did him wrong on the worst day of his life.Jim Carrey does a good job, but it is not his best comedic performance. However, it is good to see him in his old form, for he has not made a decent flick in quite awhile. For all the actors (and even actresses) who played God in other films, Freeman is funny in the role, but he is not given that much to do. Joining these two is Jennifer Aniston, who in my opinion, is one of the sexiest actresses out there today. Despite these two well known faces, this is Carrey's movie.`Bruce Almighty' is your average 'what if?' comedy. It contains the usual funny moments that you might expect from other films with a similar concept, but after all is said and done, this ends up as one of those 'ok' comedies that you should rent first, instead of going to see it at the theater.-30-",Bruce Almighty
221,miguelsanchez69,horribly boring film,3,25 June 2003,"This is a horribly boring and morally sententious film. It reminds me of a really awful frank capra film with Jim Carrey ad-libbing gags. Personally, I really like Carrey (I think ace ventura is some of the best physical acting ever and adore that film) but he doesn't have much to work with here. This movie is just not funny and even Carrey's way over the top performance (in a part for which he is somewhat miscast)can't save this dud. The message of the film, which is essentially know your place and believe in higher powers since they know what's best for is undeniably fascist and ignores centuries of discourse on theodicy as well. There are so many theological plotholes its staggering, but granted it's only a film. I probably wouldn't have had the time to notice the inconsistencies if the movie wasn't so BORING. Horribly written with saccharine dialogue and an ending that made me want to gag, poorly edited (most of the shots and sequences with gags run too long) and no chemistry between carrey and aniston. Not recommended at all. One or two funny gags do not a film make. The only funny scenes in this film were already in the trailer. Bruce in the film might be divine but Bruce Almighty is very flawed",Bruce Almighty
222,SnobbyDude,On par with Jim Carrey's other fun movies,7,27 May 2003,"Ok, so it's not a masterpiece like the Godfather, but it doesn't have to be. The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times. If it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times, it has accomplished its purpose. I laughed out loud and left with a smile.  I feel like I got my money's worth.",Bruce Almighty
223,experten,A masterpiece that will become a classic.,10,11 August 2003,"In my opinion Dumb and Dumber is Jim Carrey's funniest movie but Bruce Almighty is his best.BA is not a pure comedy like Dumb and Dumber, one that only works because of the comedic genius of Carrey (together with a brilliant Jeff Daniels).BA has quite a few typical Carrey scenes that indeed are very funny, but BA is more than the sum of those scenes, it is brilliantly acted, masterfully directed and the story is very clever too.BA is a feel good movie in the tradition of Stewart/Capra, enhanced by the comedy genius Carrey in top form. It is very good to see Carrey back in the comedy genre, even though his more dramatic movies has been very good (Truman Show) or good but easily forgotten (the rest). Comedy is what Carrey does best and he does it like no other.The casting of Morgan Freeman was perfect. He is always good, but here he is perfect. The only pity is that he will never get a Greater role :) . Jennifer Aniston was also good and it is irrelevant that she has an easy role.My rating is 10, according to the IMDb rating scale of course.Finally some remarks to other reviewers: If there is a God I'm sure He/ She/the Neutrum is mighty enough to take on whatever form or color God wants, no matter descriptions of God in the Bible. In front of Bruce God may have found it best to look like Morgan Freeman, in front of you God may want to look like a pink elephant. Who knows? The answer is not in the movie. The purpose of BA is not to answer teological questions or support one religious belief in front of another. (BA is based on the monoteistic belief, but that is hardly the purpose of the movie). The message of the movie is not, like at least one reviewer stated, the conservative thought that we should be content with our place (other than being content we are not gods). If you have to try to find messages in a comedy movie I think they will be more like this in BA: You do not have to be content with your place, but don't expect God to fix everything for you (a more radical thought, maybe BA is unsuitable material for you americans) and there might be other things than your position that are more important. But the movie is not about sending out messages, it's purpose is to entertain and it is a success.If you are looking for symbolism, messages and such you may be better off watching another kind of movie. If you don't like Carrey, Seagal or Eastwood why do you watch their movies? Does not seem very intelligent to me.",Bruce Almighty

227,psychprofessor,Not Godawful,6,6 June 2004,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, determined not to be influenced by the two stars it was given in TV Guide. After seeing the movie, I decided that that was about right. The movie was funny in spots but kind of dragged in others. Also, it was pretty predictable.
The always attractive Jennifer Anniston seemed underused, and I think the scene in which the anchor woman tries to seduce Bruce could have been funnier. She could have been the devil, for example, rather than just a beautiful woman with the hots for a coworker. My advice would be to watch this one on HBO but not to pay money to rent a DVD; you're likely to be disappointed.",Bruce Almighty
228,lists-9,Bit of a missed opportunity,5,15 November 2006,"This could have been dazzling but, for me, was a misfire, mainly because the Jim Carrey character was so hard to like. I'm a Carrey fan, but in this case, the script and direction seemed to be against him.Near the start of the film, Bruce's boss refers to another character as ""an asshole"" and says ""You couldn't be"". However, he behaves like one through most of the film, with his whining and complaining seriously overdone. You have to wonder why his girlfriend sticks with him for so long. As often, the dog (when he appears) steals the show. The best scenes are the ones a third of the way through, after Bruce first gets his powers. Here the film shows energy, with Carrey doing what he's best at - being an amusing ""wise guy"". After this, though, it all gets a bit tedious. The performances are fine, particularly from Carrey and Morgan Freeman, but the filmmakers don't seem sure about where they're heading, or what the moral (if any) is. Ultimately the film is a bit of a mess.",Bruce Almighty
229,redbirds525,A surprisingly funny movie!,8,24 May 2003,"When I first saw the trailer for ""Bruce Almighty,"" I thought it was going to fall into the category of ""Corky Romano"" or ""A Night At The Roxbury."" You know, those movies where the trailers reveal the only funny parts in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised with ""Bruce Almighty."" I don't think I've laughed so hard in a long time.Jim Carrey is teriffic as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck Buffalo lighter side of the news reporter trying desperately to get an anchor's job. I also enjoyed the performance of Jennifer Aniston in this film as Bruce's girlfriend, Grace. Aniston has proven with this, last year's ""The Good Girl"" and the funny ""Office Space"" that she has nicely evolved from TV to the big screen.  Morgan Freeman is PERFECT in this movie as God. I don't think they could have found anyone else to play that role to a T like Freeman did.
This movie is a lot more than just a series of gags. There is a well written story behind the gags and it keeps you interested. But the gags in this movie are EXTREMELY FUNNY, especially for a PG-13 movie. The part with the monkey almost had me falling out of my seat in laughter.I would highly recommend ""Bruce Almighty."" They even threw an ""Ace Ventura"" joke in there that, surprisingly, only a few people in the theater I was in caught. This is a fun comedy to see if you're in need of a good laugh. Carrey's best work since ""Me Myself and Irene."" I give ""Bruce Almighty"" * * * 1/2 stars.",Bruce Almighty
230,jeffreyjets,A Good Romantic Comedy,8,6 June 2007,"This was never designed to be more than an entertaining, sweetly uplifting movie. There have been many movies that attempt this genre and many have failed. Bruce exceeds at both the comedy and the romance, eventually. The comedy is a given since it has Jim Carey in it as long as you find him funny. I know 1 or 2 that do not. The romantic part is supplied by the one of the most gorgeous woman alive who has perfected pouting lips. (Still don't understand Brad's choice.) Bruce does go the extra effort to illicit misty eyes from most of the viewers.It could have been better, if it had used the more than capable supporting cast more effectively. Unfortunately, the storyline does not allow for close friends, since Carey's character is self centered and self pitying.",Bruce Almighty
231,bubbathom,Very funny!,8,11 July 2008,"This movie was one of those comedies where there's a lot of hilarious parts, but a lot of boring parts. Usually those movies kind of get on my nerve, but this one had a pretty good storyline behind it. That made most of the boring parts have a bit of a point. So, it was a bit unbelievable, but funny. Also, unlike most comedies, the main character goes through a change. Bruce starts out as a bit of a jerk who likes to blame God for most of his misfortunes. Then, God notices this and meets Bruce, giving him his powers for a while. At first, Bruce uses the powers to only his advantage. He then notices how he can help so many other people and be a good person. So by the end of the movie, Bruce has gone through a massive change, now praising God for his good fortunes.Overall, a very entertaining and funny movie. 8/10",Bruce Almighty

Since the ordinary Jim Carrey is just a bunch of silly grimaces and silly jokes, this might be seen as heaven compared to such horrible movies as Ace Ventura and stuff. But the story in this movie is fairly ridiculous, right? But at the same time, its funny really funny. For the first time, Carrey makes a good job as actor. And so does Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman, but those two does practically a good job in any movie they're in.But the movie still is far from perfect. Some scenes might be too long, and the funny parts in them are dragged on. And when they go on like that, they become ridiculous. But its still worth seeing.

Why on earth would she want to be with this guy, he was just a self absorbed jerk.3. There seemed to be not much ""helping"" of others going on in this movie. Some bad events happened to people in other countries and stuff, and nobody around seemed to care at all, not God or anyone.  As if the characters and Buffalo NY were the center of the universe and who cares about anything else.Jim Cary was his usual funny self, but this movie just stank because it was just not consistent and Jennifer Aniston's character was just a prop.Get a clue people! Make movies where women have brains puh-leeze!  Women ARE smarter than you in real life so why don't you reflect that in your crappy movies?Oh and the ass humor never was funny, it is just gross.

Well, I must admit, I'm not exactly a fan of romantic comedies, so of course the end was way too overdone for me.

241,LadySailor1975,"As Usual, Carrey Delivers Laughs with a Moderate Plot",7,1 May 2012,"I did laugh a lot. I will be honest about that.Bruce Nolan is a selfish and conceited man who does not think of the needs and wants of others and does not consider consequences of his actions. All he cares about is ""me me me me me."" Bruce constantly complains about God and says that God is ignoring him and maybe even laughing at him. One day, Bruce meets God face-to-face and is given God's powers. The first thing he does is set the wheels in motion to get back what he wants; such as lead anchor at the news station and getting his rival fired. He does eventually ""help"" the people that pray to him, but he simply answers ""Yes"" to all the prayers and this sets off catastrophe, such as hundreds of lottery winners all at once and each winner getting only 17 dollars. Riots break out and things go just as bad for Bruce himself as he realizes what he has done.Becoming God would not solve all your problems. God is not a lucky horseshoe or rabbit's foot. He does not interfere with free will, which is just what the movie does state. The biggest mistake the movie was that God says ""they have the power"" as if saying ""they don't need me."" Prayer and action go together. People who do follow the Bible will tell you that. You cannot just pray and expect to get what you want. If you need a job, pray and go out and apply. Take the right actions and pray, and God will lead you to the right job. You cannot just pray and wait and expect that somebody will ring your doorbell and say ""I want to hire you for my company!""Sometimes, God does say ""no"" to what you ask for. Maybe he has something better for you later. God helps those that help themselves. If you were just to pray and do nothing, you will not obtain what you want/need. The plot holes in the story did have to do with free will. Bruce does seem to interfere with it, such as making Tony Bennett wave at him as if he knew him. But, all movies have plot holes. Altogether, this movie is fun. It can be funny and amusing to even the atheist population. I would not buy it, but I would rent it every once in a great while.",Bruce Almighty
242,Jeremy-124,An unholy dud,4,15 January 2004,"I'm glad I saw this movie for one reason only, and that reason is a hysterically funny scene where Bruce (Jim Carrey) uses his powers to make his rival newsanchor (Steven Carell) babble like a crazy person on the air.   I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face during that scene -- Carell steals the show here.I think that Carrey is truly an original genius who is capable of sublime slapstick, and also of being very good in movies that offer more, like ""The Truman Show."" But just about everything about this movie feels tired and labored.  The TV news stuff is bad satire (except for that one great scene) because it has no relation to reality whatsoever -- it's just silly without being funny.   And the movie has a very irritating musical score (very similar to ""Liar, Liar"") that telegraphs everything, helping to spoil what little humor there is.Morgan Freeman hits the perfect note as God, underplaying his role nicely.Jennifer Aniston is OK, but the role is undeserving of her talents.Worst of all, the movie goes sickeningly sentimental toward the end.

243,caamich,Charming but Silly,7,11 June 2003,"Morgan Freeman's portrayal of God was very endearing in this movie. I enjoyed it quite a bit. A lot of the movie was just plain silliness, which, I must admit, was refreshing in the midst of all these smash-em, bash-em action/suspense/thriller movies that are overtaking the industry these days. With all the *real* violence going on in the world, I prefer to watch a movie that helps me *escape* it for a couple hours, not bury me in it. It's hard enough to face reality once I *leave* the theater.I was also relieved that this movie didn't contain Jim Carey's tendency toward what I call toilet humor. (See the Ace Ventura movies for an example of what I mean.) No, this was, for the most part, just good, clean humor tossed in with--gasp!--tough decisions based on morals.It's at least worth one viewing. I won't pay theater price to see it again (that's where I saw it this time), but I'd watch it again on video if someone I knew hadn't seen it and was in the mood for a lighthearted comedy.Warning, though: Several parts of this movie could be considered blasphemous to those who are seriously religious.

Got me. Why did God pick him? No idea. And all this comes down to him proposing to his live-in because she's unhappy with their arrangement?

We are made the way we are for a purpose, and always, the reason is to maintain the balance.This movie rocks 2003 because it got nearly everything: love story, extreme comedy, romance, drama, tragic, and Satanism (just kidding).8/10 because it shook the comedy world, so does ours.*If you believed that, i don't know what to say.",Bruce Almighty

I watched the whole thing from beginning to end and didn't laugh a single time. In fact, I didn't find one thing in the movie worthy of even remembering. Most of the time I was trying to figure out why Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman agreed to do this film. They must have gotten a bundle of money out of it up front. They were both overpaid. I know why Jim Carrey is in it. This is a film suited to his silly antics. Well, it turned me off. He didn't even do a good job.",Bruce Almighty
247,BlackX,What if God was one of us? It would be pretty funny.,8,19 December 2003,"I really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites. It's not preachy, it's not anchored by it's moral, it shouldn't be controversial. It's just God. Any possible God, no matter the religion. And it's really funny.Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself (more or less TO himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job. This drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. When the final straws are executed, he's quick to not laugh, but yell in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he's guilted into helping others, where he then continues to miss the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground.OK, that was kinda long. But as a plot, it works well. The step-by-step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems together, and is able to hide itself fairly well.As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carrey's pitch-perfect acting stays in character (which, luckily enough, is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution. And the humour is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, it would kinda feel like a It's a Wonderful Life wannabe.Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. At least, you don't think that when you see her. She gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple.The movie feels ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carrey's career (which wasn't goin' anywhere.).",Bruce Almighty

The film from start to finish was amazing as usual, the effects were awesome and the music to the film fit perfectly with what was going on and of course Morgan Freeman was amazing as god. One of my favourite characters has to be of course Bruce, he is funny and also he is such a genuine character. My favourite moment has to be when Bruce is walking along testing out god's powers and the song 'I Got The Power' comes on, funniest, moment ever in the film.

Although I was somewhat hesitant about what I have heard of this movie at first, it turned out to be pretty darn good. Bruce (Jim Carrey), an aspiring TV anchorman, goes through life struggling and blames all of his misfortunes on God. Bruce then meets God (Morgan Freeman) and is given his powers for a time. Bruce then uses these powers to his own advantage to raise himself, but ends up losing his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), in the process. It is only after losing the woman that he loves so much that Bruce realizes what he really wants in life and gives in to the will of God. Then he regains the love of Grace and succeeds in his work life as well.At first, this movie seemed somewhat sacrilegious as Bruce goes around doing whatever he wants in the world, but the movie ends up having some very true, and very strong lessons to it. I especially like the play on words with Grace being the name of Bruce's girlfriend, but also being the only thing that he wants from God by the end of the movie. The line about being the miracle is especially true as many people thing that all they have to do is sit back and everything will be taken care of the way they would like it. So get up, do something, and make your life what you want it to be!Bruce Almighty is a good movie that is funny, but also solemn when appropriate.

Some people that are Christian might think that, but it isn't. It's about Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey, Liar Liar) who is an anchorman who's life is going horrible until God (Morgan Freeman, The Shankshaw Redemption) shows up. God gives his powers to Bruce and he impresses Grace Connely (Jennifer Anniston, Picture Perfect), his girlfriend. The funniest scene I liked was when Bruce kept typing things that weren't true and that made Evan Baxter (Steve Carnell, The 40-Year Old Virgin) fart and speak gibberish.

However I only scored the film a 6 because I'd seen most of the funny visuals in the film's trailer but didn't find this a spoiler unusually so much as to find Carrey's character dislikeable, being so self-centred but what a mope his girlfriend is. She didn't communicate well with the Carrey character.

In the beginning, Jim was a little over the top when one considered that this character was supposed to be a fairly normal person (as opposed to the mask or ace ventura), but somehow he makes it work.  B-E-A-Utiful was stupid.  Note to Jim Carrey and agent: he doesn't ALWAYS need a catchy line (All righty then, sssmookin) to pull off a movie. My only real complaint about the film, however, was some of the worst editing I have ever seen in a movie.  I counted painfully obvious boom mikes appearing at the top of the screen at least six times, including set cutouts for the ceiling of his and J.Aniston's apartment.  Also, during the scene where he meets god on top of Mt. Everest, there are taped 'X's on the backdrop in several scenes.  Terrible. Overall, a 6/10.",Bruce Almighty

I have watched it already at least four time sin three days! Plot summary: Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), is down on his luck, when he gets a mysterious call on his pager, so he goes to a building, and meets God (Morgan Freeman) face to face, and God gives Bruce all of his powers.I like the message of this movie. It's a story of not complaining about God, and to have faith in him! I kept laughing out loud at this movie, especially at the part where Bruce is looking through prayers and he has over 3,000,000, and he says ""What a bunch of whiners!"" and the part where he makes Evan embarrass himself! I couldn't stop laughing! All in all, it's an incredible movie! I recommend seeing it!",Bruce Almighty

Jim Carrey as the title character is really funny. Jim Carrey gives a really good performance in this movie. Morgan Freeman does a really good job as God in the movie. The movie also has a lot of funny moments. The film does a really good job on pace. The movie always goes on a good pace and never feels like it is going too fast or too slow. Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston also have really good chemistry with each other. Bruce Almighty is a great comedy that gives us great funny moments with a good performance by Jim Carrey and a really good script. My only problems with the movie are there are a lot of plot holes in the movie that bother me, and the ending is honestly cheesy, but this is still a great movie that I recommend.",Bruce Almighty
257,stimpil,Jim Carrey is a funny guy...,6,13 September 2005,"I just don't know why he keeps trying to concentrate on pronouncing words incorrectly. That's not comedy, that's a speech impediment.Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a struggling reporter for a local TV station in Buffalo. After some pretty terrible things happen to him, like he's passed over for a promotion, and he gets beaten up by a bunch of Hispanics (Congratulations to Noel Gugliemi for landing the role of 'Hispanic Thug #1' yet again). These kinds of things would ruin anyone's day, I'm sure. He blames God (Morgan Freeman, in another fresh and original role unlike any he has ever undertaken) for all of his problems, like most rational people do, but God has a trick up his sleeve: he's going to give Bruce his powers! Oh, what fun! Instead of making himself master of the world, or a multi-billionaire, Bruce instead abuses his powers in less creative ways, such as to make the dog pee in the toilet, which is probably just what I would do if I were ALL-POWERFUL.Well, if there's one thing I can't get enough of, it's heart-warming comedies where characters learn something. This is just the type of movie that is just too absent from Hollywood.Oh, wait, every damn movie that comes out follows this exact same formula. I've been fooled yet again! Damn you Hollywood!

The plot gives you something to think about and the humor is top notch. The ending is a little sappy but that doesn't detract much from this fine movie. Recommended viewing!My rating : @@@@ (out of five)",Bruce Almighty
260,cestlavie03,Different Than Expected (possibly spoilers),8,22 July 2003,"But still good. Jim Carrey offers a funny yet serious performance as a man who has lost faith in God. After spending a while in God's shoes, he discovers that the job ain't that easy and has trouble figuring out how he's supposed to help so many people who are praying to him every second of every day. Meanwhile, he's having problems with his job and his girlfriend (Aniston).In the end, this movie completely shocked me. I expected it to be ALL fun and laughs and nothing really serious. As it turns out, Bruce (Carrey) turns out to be a sensitive man only willing to please his girlfriend and make her happy even if that involves him not being in her life. He also learns that the people praying to God, need to have enough faith in themselves to figure things out themselves, and believe in themselves. It holds for a very strong and possibly very emotional ground for those that have extreme faith in God. Some may be offended by some of Carrey's remarks when angry with God; others may find this movie insightful to their own faith and prayer.
If neither, you still have Carrey to give you a couple of laughs along the way!",Bruce Almighty

And I have to tell you this film looked pretty funny. Let me tell you it was more than that! This has to be another one of Jim Carrey's best & funniest films!! It was Hilarious!!! Now, yes it's kind of an insult to be sort of making fun of god, even though it was funny it was kind of edgy, but it was still good. No doubt about that. Oh, and another thing I don't the film needed to have an f-word or be rated PG-13, but despite that this film was great. Weird and little mean, but great & very funny.

Actually, ""Bruce Almighty"" is not a bad movie, but it's so terribly mediocre that it just gets tiring. The worst thing is, the premise is fantastic and this could have been great, but of all people Tom (Patch Adams) Shadyac got the directing bid. Yes, this is the man that also helmed ""Ace Ventura"" and the decent ""Liar Liar"" but even the latter film had a tinge of syrupy wholesomeness that undermined the that film's comic premise. Basically, ""Bruce Almighty"" needed a little edge, and Shadyac was not the man to deliver it. What is the point of this film? What humor there is turns maudlin and dopey before we're even out of Act II. Hollywood just gets sadder and sadder. Do you know what would of made this film great? Imagine Woody Allen directing.

269,stuckfly,Go see it with your family and friends!,10,3 June 2003,"Jim is back, and better than ever!  I'm glad Jim Carrey has explored more dramatic roles.  Although not as entertaining or profitable, his more serious acting endeavors have clearly allowed him to refine his unique talents.Bruce Almighty showcases a perfect balance of touching drama and hillarious comedy in his peculiar style.  Emotional moments are just long enough to make things personal, and short enough to break up the laughter so as to give your ribs much needed rest.Aside from a little profanity, which actually fits the situations, it's a very clean film (contemporarily speaking).  It's not a deeply religious film, and it doesn't come off overly preachy.  God is God; not a one-size-fits-all, nameless, genderless being.  He's Morgan Freeman, and there is no more comfortable guy in all the universe.The movie promotes common-sense spirituality, such as taking responsibility for the bad and good in life (rather than blaming God), praying to God earnestly and personally, and lightening up (a message present day clergy should pay attention to).  Surprisingly, the feel-good messages do not have a plastic feel; they're sensible and thought provoking.  One gets a sense that maybe God isn't such a big party-pooper after all.Jennifer Aniston's performance is excellent.  She makes the movie work by showing the unfair effects of Bruce's selfish behavior on her innocent character.  She gets to display a much wider range of her acting talent than TV roles permit.God's vocation provides the framework of the movie, but the story has more to do with situational comedy and drama; a series of errors and their consequences.  It answers the question we all daydream about: What would you do if you had God's powers?  Answer: You'd adjust things to your liking, settle scores, and do good deeds from your limited perspective; basically screw everything up!If this film doesn't delight you and make you ponder your attitude, there's something fundamentally wrong inside of you.

270,jmm509,This movie is almighty!,7,22 June 2003,BRUCE ALMIGHTY-*** What can we expect when we go to a Jim Carrey and that is two things success and laughter.  In one of latest hits Jim Carrey plays Bruce who always seems to be down on his luck and is recently fired from a huge mistake at the News channel.  He survives only from the support from his girlfriend who is played by Jennifer Aniston.  Something beyond belief happens next Jim Carrey has a meeting to go to.  He meets God who is played Morgan Freeman.  Bruce expresses all of his anger towards God and gives Bruce a job of a life time and that is his job.  We see Jim Carrey use the power for all sorts of reasons and to turn his life back around. The performances were nothing more and nothing less than an average Carrey film and I thought especially that Morgan Freeman who had the role God gave the movie more of a better attuitude and sensation to our feelings on the film.,Bruce Almighty
271,JacquiQ,Trying too hard is the main feeling. Yet I did come out smiling.,7,23 May 2003,"Bruce Almighty  was uneven, but mostly fun.  It seemed to be trying too hard. Some of it was predictably Jim Carrey slapstick stuff, which just didn't feel didn't feel spontaneous. The movie spent alot of time trying to show Bruce as a totally narcissistic character who blames God for EVERYTHING (even mistakes of his own making) and yet it was trying to keep us feeling that Bruce isn't  --really --  a bad guy, just a completely self-centered goofball. Trying too hard is the main feeling of this movie. Yet I did come out smiling.   Morgan Freeman (as God) was marvelous.  I really liked Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's love-interest; she was a realistic character and we got to know and like her. The movie had a number of unexpected turns and was overall worth seeing.  Even more worth seeing if you wait and see it ""at the $1.50 theater"".",Bruce Almighty
272,mrmunkoms,All Hail Jim,8,28 November 2003,What a great movie.  It's kind of sad it didn't get the ratings it should have.  Anyway this is a very funny movie that I highly recommend to anyone. The comedy is there and there is actually a sense of feeling in the movie which some people probably wouldn't expect.  The milk part at the beginning is probably the funniest part.  Solid comedy that's one of Carey's best. 9/10,Bruce Almighty
273,imdbalopexci,Very Funny,7,31 May 2003,Bruce Almighty was better than I thought.  If you had to see one Jim Carrey film you should see this one.  It was really funny.

274,elevator_opratr,"Idea very similar to ""Groundhog Day""",6,10 June 2004,"Two things about this movie:1) Did anyone notice how this movie is loosely based upon the same storyline as Bill Murray's ""Groundhog Day"" from a decade ago? Both are about sarcastic and cynical TV personalities disgusted with their current position in life. And both are about being granted with some sort of supernatural power or affliction to help teach them a lesson. Both characters at first abuse that power, and then learn to use it to the betterment of their own attitude and helping society. 2) This has got to be the most juvenile adult film I've ever seen. It's almost like a ""kid's mentality"" film for adults. It still doesn't get as many kudos in my book as ""Groundhog Day,"" but it's worth seeing. Warning though, this movie is very stupid, but in a good-hearted way.",Bruce Almighty
275,joe-elliott2,Averages out to be pretty good,7,5 November 2008,"Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10",Bruce Almighty
276,livealot,An Almighty Movie,7,15 August 2003,"What If Jim Carrey was god? POSSIBLE SPOILERSBruce Almighty explores the issue, while trying as hard as it can to not spark any religious debate. This is a enjoyable and funny movie, while trying hard to provide a message, though they don't really deliever on that.Jim Carrey plays a disgruntled news reporter called Bruce Nolan who flips after not getting the Anchor job, he gets fired and he blames God, God responds to this by giving Bruce his powers hence the trouble begins.The acting is good, Jim Carrey could play this role with his eyes closed and his arms tied behind his back. Morgan Freeman is perfect as god, I can't think of many other actors that can say ""I am god"" and have me believe it. Jennifer Aniston plays her normal role, though she could have done with a little more screen time. The supporting cast is excellent, Catherine Bell doesn't get any screen time. Steven Carell plays Evan Baxter, who is Bruce Nolan's arch enemy. Baxter got the anchor job ahead of Bruce and features in the best scene of the movie - where Jim Carrey makes Carell do some typical Carrey moves. Everyone I talked to had this scene as their favourite.So it was a fun movie, it could have been better but it delievered on what it set out to do.7/10",Bruce Almighty
277,Citizen_Cam,"Is it a comedy or not, guys?",6,28 March 2005,"There are two directions in which you can take a movie with the premise of Bruce Almighty. That premise, in which a mortal man is endowed with all of God's powers, is certainly an intriguing one, and lends itself to one direction or the other. Either you can make it a wild, outrageous comedy, with the comic premise being that the hero can do whatever he chooses without consequence, or you can make it a drama about the burden of power and show that every action does have a consequence. Bruce Almighty unwisely tries to do both at the same time. The hero of the story is Bruce (Jim Carrey). Now, to me, his life seemed OK; he has a job as a reporter for a Buffalo news agency, a beautiful girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) and enough money to see him through, given the amount of fancy stuff in his house, at any rate. But Bruce isn't happy - he wants to be the network anchorman, for example. When everything in his life starts to go wrong; the office jerk gets the anchor job, Bruce cracks up on air and gets fired, he curses God for allowing all this to happen. And before you know it, God turns up, in the form of Morgan Freeman. God offers Bruce a deal: have all His powers and see if he can do better. For a while after he gets them, Bruce does all kinds of crazy things, and for that while you think the movie is taking the outrageous, wild direction, thus far seen in many of Carrey's other films, notably Ace Ventura. He parts his soup, for instance. He enlarges his girlfriend's breasts. He brings the moon closer to the earth for romantic purposes. He gives his un-housebroken dog the ability to use the toilet. And, most amusingly, he sabotages the jerk news anchor's first time on-air, making him spout gibberish. But then, suddenly, halfway through the movie, the jokes all stop. It suddenly becomes a drama, with the usual maudlin scenes, and the usual girlfriend leave/emotional crisis/win her back/crying scenario results. By the end, I was waiting for Jimmy Stewart to show up. I've seen all that before. There is, of course, a moral, which is jammed down the throat so hard it comes out your rear (not unlike a monkey in one of the film's more humorous scenes). Bruce Almighty fails because of identity crisis. It can't decide what it wants to be - comedy or drama. The cast make a good fist of it; Carrey has already established he can act, in films like The Truman Show, but here he shows that he can still flail his limbs with the best of them. Freeman is well cast as God, and does a nice job of being sufficiently divine. Aniston is less impressive, but not unbearably so. The jokes the film does have, heavily concentrated in the first half, are often hilarious. I just wish they'd gone on longer. Good-o-meter rating: 6/10",Bruce Almighty

279,EdMatt13,B E A utiful,7,5 June 2021,"Bruce Almighty has no right to be as good as it actually is; and indeed a film of it's nature would not normally be a film I would actually get emotional over.Jim Carrey's Bruce Nolan is a news anchor who often finds himself being underutilised and underappreciated in the workplace (Or at least that is how he perceives it) and longs to prove himself to the world- an aspiration which he finds much easier to achieve after being gifted god like powers.The core of this film lies in its comedy- the over the top performances from Steve Carell and Jim Carrey elevate the already well written comedy, providing arguably one of the funniest scenes put to film.The more emotional heart to the film can be easier to miss but the more genuine moments provide a nice moment of respite amongst the exaggerated comedy of the rest of the movie, the growing conflict and eventual split between Bruce and Jennifer Aniston's Grace culminates in an emotional final moment between Bruce and God.The film does lack many important emotional beats, none of the characters outside of Bruce and Grace feel particularly well developed and the comedy is very hit or miss and does rely on the viewer having a very silly sense of humour, but I don't really care because I don't think the film needs to be excellent to be enjoyed and the comedy- which is all that really matters- hits the mark in most places.I would recommend Bruce Almighty to nearly everyone, just maybe don't go into it with high expectations or expecting a masterpiece. Also a definite recommendation for Back to the Future fans- look out for the clock tower in the background of some scenes!Thanks for reading :)",Bruce Almighty
280,Dario_Gino,A must see!! Look past the obvious humor and find the deeper meaning as well.,9,10 September 2008,"This movie is amazing! While being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception. In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him. As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was truly there. This movie was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, ""Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?"" and my humble addition, ""May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out.""",Bruce Almighty

Not only was it not blasphemous, it actually could strengthen one's faith in the higher power. There were several scenes that were very deep in spiritual meaning, even if delivered thru the most annoyingly silly actor in Hollywood. Now granted, Jim Carrey is way over the top in this one sometimes (even by Jim Carrey standards), but move past it, laugh at some toilet humor, and be sure and catch the deeper meaning!If you're going just to laugh at someone talking out of their butt or hitting themselves in the head with a hammer, then you've chosen the wrong picture.

282,Arsenic Drone,"Great concept, poor execution",4,15 January 2004,"How can you mess up a comedy about an ordinary man (Jim Carrey as a somewhat self-centered reporter) being given the powers of God? I suppose a better question is how to do it right, and on that subject the creators of Bruce Almighty missed the mark.This film takes an idea that almost everyone has wondered about in some form, in one of those ""what if?"" daydreams, and gives it a specific incarnation. The viewer is treated to some very well-done effects, like Bruce parting traffic, instantly coating everything in sight with Post-it notes, and driving girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) wild. Don't forget the scene that makes the movie worth watching: Bruce forcing his competitor, anchorman Evan Baxter (Steven Carell from The Daily Show) to ramble and babble like a lunatic while on the air.However, the plot comes up kind of short. It gets somewhat fragmented with all of the funny physical comedy, and then when it tries to hit on an emotional level (and a somewhat sappy, unoriginal one at that), there hasn't been enough buildup. In particular, Grace and her relationship with Bruce aren't given enough exposition to expect the viewer to naturally care about them, so some things come out forced. For the most part though, this is forgivable, since the film is really a comedy with a spiritual message, which it does get across.The real problem is the soundtrack. The orchestral score is distracting and too demonstrative. It's reminiscent of cartoons or pure slapstick comedies: too many musical sound effects. It's almost surprising that there's no trombone going ""bwa bwa bwaaah"" when something bad happens to Bruce. On the other hand, the film isn't actually for small children like the score would suggest, since there is a fair amount of cursing and mature material (for example, Bruce driving Grace wild). Perhaps it might have been better served going with an R rating, exploring the idea more thoroughly, and tossing out the cheesy sound effects. Since the creators didn't make that movie, we don't know. In any case, the one they did make is passable, but does not live up to the high standard set by the concept it's based on.",Bruce Almighty

288,Christeen,Awesome!,9,24 May 2003,This movie was very funny and made me cry. There was surprising depth here. I left the theatre feeling uplifted and inspired. One of Jim Carrey's best movies. He and Jennifer Anniston had great chemistry. A movie everyone should see.,Bruce Almighty
289,stevefisher,Wow! Jim Carrey's best.,8,25 May 2003,"This is a very difficult movie to pin down. Odds are you've seen the trailers so you have a basic idea already, so I'm not really going to describe the plot.Bruce Almighty is a funny story, but it is not devoid of drama and emotional impact. It really is a better balanced movie than anything he's done so far.This movie takes a share of the craziness of the original Ace Ventura, adds a bit of The Mask's over-the-top physical jokes, slides in the an approachable, lovable everyman like we saw in The Truman Show, and adds (at last!) a mature romance. The result is somehow much more than the sum of the parts, and is fresh despite the influences of previous movies. Unless you need a high dosage of ass-talking or toilet humor in a Carrey movie, I think you'll find that this is him at his best. Something I really don't think we've seen before.I really hope this is a sign of good things to come from him.",Bruce Almighty
290,bigv82,Reduced to tears!,8,29 May 2003,"Well not actually. This movie is very entertaining though. Went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the ""I think there might be something in my eye"" routine. The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. In fact all the characters are great. The movie is not overly funny or sappy, good flick to go see with the wife.All in All 8/10....note * I am not an easy grader. Thats all from BigV over and out!",Bruce Almighty
291,seangd,Good topic for a comedy,6,15 June 2003,"This movie was fairly entertaining.  I really like the topic that they chose, and my personal feeling is that it takes some level of guts to produce this thing.  There were several points during the movie where I ""belly-laughed"" (a rare occurrence), and truthfully I really gauge a comedy's worth by how much I do that.  I really liked ""Old School"", so much that I bought the DVD, and this movie nearly hangs with it. 6/10.",Bruce Almighty
292,kgsmith1,8 FOR A JIM CARREY MOVIE?!?,7,27 June 2003,"I kind of questioned myself when I checked in an 8, but the movie is simply that entertaining.First of all, I don't go into movies looking for something the movie shouldn't be.  This movie is a comedy; so if I can laugh through it and enjoy myself, it has served it's purpose well.  There were plenty of funny scenes in Bruce Almighty, but what really impressed me was the storyline and execution.For once, a comedy's storyline actually works well and holds interest throughout the movie.  While more could have been done with it, the major points were covered, and everything that needed to be there was fit in within the running time of the movie.I thought the acting by Carrey was quite good, and Anniston was adequate. Morgan Freeman, as always, played a superb role and it may have influenced my opinion on this movie somewhat because my vision of God is very similar to how Freeman portrays him.  The scene where God asks Bruce to help mop the floor is something I could very well see God doing.Regardless of whether you believe in the more humorous portrayal of God, it will not damper your interest in this movie.  With a good plot and a lot of laughs, it's a cant-miss for the summer.  If your date is going to drag you to a movie, you can do a LOT worse.",Bruce Almighty

I guess these lessons of life can be applied to any religion in the world. But a few times I was afraid that what they did in the movie would become blasphemy.Anyway, Jim Carrey was amazing as Bruce Nolan and really carried the movie well, although a few times I felt he was a little bit too much Jim Carrey.Nevertheless an excellent movie and when it's done, you are happy and really have a feeling you've actually seen a good movie that was worth your time.",Bruce Almighty

Next day he starts receiving calls from a no. on his pager.When he calls the no. he gets a message which rouses his curiosity, and he goes, without knowng that the encounter is going to change his life. There he meets ...God!(played absolutely superbly by Morgan Freeman) He gives Bruce 2 weeks to be God, and see how difficult his job is.Although suspecting some elaborate practical joke, Bruce gradually realises that he is in fact God The next 30-45 mins are easily the most enjoyable of the movie, with Jim Carrey in his elements, playing cocky arrogant but yet sooooooooo likable the way only he can.He extracts vengeance on all those who had wronged him. the goons, his rival, has the most amazing sex with Grace , gets himself a car to die for, and so on. u get the idea.However, like all romantic comedies, it loses steam halfway through when it goes into the love story gone sour part.The second half basically drags on to a conclusion which everyone already knows.

297,ohioguy24,The Theatrical Trailer Fooled Me,5,28 May 2003,"First of all, I'm glad Jim Carrey is back at what he does best, comedy. But Bruce Almighty is not a good movie as a whole. The previews and theatrical trailers group all the good parts of the movie and get people to come in by showing the highlights of the film. But the rest of the movie they don't show you during the previews is empty and just not worth the money. I don't blame Jim Carrey one bit, there were times I lost it and crying in tears he was so funny, but it couldn't save the final cut. You will laugh, no doubt about it, but it will only be for like 3 minutes total. Save your money and rent it later.",Bruce Almighty
298,stile1973,Very good God spoof,7,1 February 2007,"Plot summary: the plot is fairly simple - Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) finds his life in the gutter, but for some reason God (played by Morgan Freeman) decides to give Bruce His powers for a while to see how difficult it actually is to be God.Comments: The movie is perfectly cast - Carrey, Freeman, Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston, and Catherine Bell are all perfect in their roles. Steve Carell shows his comic genius during the anchor scene, which you have to see to appreciate. Jim Carrey is also an incredible comic actor, regardless of the bad press that he receives, I think he is a talented and diverse actor with extraordinary comic range. The story idea is original and well constructed, although slightly predictable at times. It also suffers from a lack of an exploration of God's powers and His role in the world - there was a great deal more that could have been done with this idea.Overall an entertaining and highly watchable film. Worth checking out if you haven't seen it yet.",Bruce Almighty
299,elmonose,AWESOMELY FUNNY + NOT offensive,10,24 May 2003,"It is one of Carrey's finest as he mixes his mania w/mellow for a winning combo.

It is also a chick flick to some degree, but no one was complaining. I was stunned to see a LINE for this movie!! That is so rare...only the Matrix Reloaded has done it so far this year. So, the word on the street is...SEE THIS MOVIE !!!It's worth your time abd money!!!",Bruce Almighty

The story was good enough, not brilliant, but it did have some surprises with a few lines and actions catching me off guard.This is not a movie about religion and it barely touches the subject, however it does deliver a clear message towards the end, which was pleasing.I gave this movie 7/10 simply because I was entertained, had a smile on my face for most of the time, laughed out more than a couple of times, and completely forgot I had children for nearly two hours (parents will understand this).  Good job all round.",Bruce Almighty

302,Thomps2525,Funny but perpetuates a myth,10,25 May 2003,"""Bruce Almighty"" is clever, funny, thought-provoking, and filled with Bible-based sight gags that will easily be overlooked by those who aren't familiar with God's Word. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of God was done as righteously (pun intended) as a human could do it. I won't spoil the ending, but there are lessons learned about God and prayer and power, lessons that should far outweigh anyone's fears that the film is sacrilegious or blasphemous. My only complaint involved a reference to someone being ""frozen stiff"" like Walt Disney. This gag just perpetuates the myth that began shortly after Walt's death in 1966. Walt's body was not frozen but was cremated and interred in a Forest Lawn cemetery. Shame on the filmmakers!",Bruce Almighty
303,suntorytime10,Bruce ALLLLLLLLL-Mighty then!,8,24 June 2003,"If you could be God for one week, what would you do? This are some the questions highlighted in the films trailer, and have made us all start to wonder what we would each do with the power beyond power. Well, you could take some tips from the film that can proudly be crowned the year's classiest and funniest comedy.The enigmatic Carrey stars as local news reporter Bruce Nolan. Though having a girlfriend to die for in Grace (Aniston), Bruce is becoming tired of his meaningless existence, and after he is rejected the job of anchor man at the news station, blames God for his demise, claiming that He has had it in for him for a while. However, hell hath no fury like the Almighty p***ed, and soon enough, God appears in the grandiose and charming form of Morgan Freeman. Bruce, as you can imagine, is not won over by His attempts to convey his almighty prowess. But soon enough, Bruce bows down before his Maker, and starts off his new job in earnest. So what would you have done? Blowing up a woman's skirt, giving Grace the most powerful `pleasurable' experience ever, and teaching his rival news anchor how to effectively `clear' your throat before every transmission, are just some of Bruce's `preferences'. Nevertheless, Bruce soon learns that and the awesome challenge that faces the Man Upstairs, isn't a walk in the park by any means, and sets out to right as many wrongs as he can, while trying to discover the true meaning of his being.Audiences rarely lye, and with a Stateside gross of over $200 million, it's easy to see what the fuss is all about with this one. Carrey, wrongly criticised for his recent move away from comedy, has never been better. His performance is not only one of his effervescent and vivacious jesting loved by so many, but also recalls the sincerity and earnestness of his turns in ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Majestic"". Carrey is on screen virtually the length of the film, with his natural charisma in tow, he is effortlessly watchable. The same can be said of the other two-thirds of the films main trio. Freeman is always reliable, and here as the All-Powerful, he is as magnificent and compelling as ever. And Aniston effortlessly slips into her role, and although she has little to do at times, provides the film with its sassiness, lighting up the screen with a glow that very few present day actresses can produce.
Director Shadyac proves his worth as a comedy director, managing to give the film some clever and neat guidance throughout. The scriptwriters too know their comedy, and although Carrey's input is obvious, still manage to effectively combine the slapstick with the meaningful impeccably. And although the religious undertones and the clichéd ending may put some people off, don't let it hamper one of the most enjoyable movie experiences you'll have this year. ****",Bruce Almighty
304,Pandabear419,There is no racial dicrimation in this movie,8,3 August 2003,"Did you notice that GOD was black and Bruce was white?!!!!  Do you think that was done on purpose??  No racial discrimination here.  The real world should be so racially liberal.  I am sure that the director did this on purpose.  I thourghly enjoyed this move.  I  AM glad Jim Carrey went back to comedy after his attempt with drama in his 2001 movie ""The Majestic"".  It was ok, but comedy is his genre.  The cast was strong Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemotion) was great, as was Jennifer Aniston ""are my boobs getting bigger?"" I give it **** out of a possible(*****)  Very watchable and alot of laughs for all of us Jim Carrey fans",Bruce Almighty
305,tomsandlin,merely observations,5,9 June 2004,"I thought the movie was funny but I believe Jim Carey did carry the movie. There are not enough well developed characters in the movie so it is hard to really care about them at all or have a sense of who they are because all you get are glimpses of characters. I love the fact that they had a black actor play the part of God because so many times he is assumed to be a white man with a long flowing white beard and it is good to break stereotypes. Also I can imagine that many of us might react the same way in the beginning if we were bestowed with the powers of the almighty.The key thing to remember is as they said in the movie that we all have free will, and how does God get people to love Him when there is free will to contend with. For that matter how does any of us get someone to love us? You have to get to know that person first right? How do you get to know God? Just a thought to ponder.",Bruce Almighty

308,Sasha_5,"The Power of God, In Unlikely Hands...",6,28 August 2008,"What would you do if you felt that everything in life was against you? That no matter what you did, it was never good enough for anyone or anything. Would you persevere? Just plain give up on trying? Or would you lash out at God, after all when it seems the entire universe is against you, only one being could even possibly help you out of that kind of trouble. If you chose the option of lashing out at God, which under some circumstances isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it's done in proper context and with respect for God. By lashing out at God do you think that would solve your problems? Do you think that God would snap his fingers and make your problems simply disappear or that maybe God would sort of take a vacation and give you His powers for a while to see if you could do His job better? If you thought the answer about God giving you His powers was correct, then clearly you haven't been reading your Bible all that closely, but you have probably been watching or at least heard of the movie starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, ""Bruce Almighty"". ""Bruce Almighty"" is the story of a down-trodden news reporter, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), who believes that the entire world, nay the universe, is against him in all that he does. Bruce's girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), tries to assure him that one of these days things will begin to turn around for him, but Bruce doesn't believe this to be true. So after lashing out at God in anger, accusing Him of not doing His job properly, Bruce is given a life-changing opportunity. A personal visit with God (Morgan Freeman), leaves Bruce endowed with all of God's powers, and God challenges Bruce to see if he can do a better job than the Almighty God can. Truly one of Jim Carrey's most hilarious performances since ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"", this over-the-top, laugh until you hurt comedy will leave you wanting to go back to watch it time and time again. ""Bruce Almighty"" may come off as blasphemous to some, though I'm a Christian and I found it to not be blasphemous, but that's my opinion and not everyone agrees with me. Though this movie is truly hilarious, there are some deep issues regarding faith, and man's relationship with God that get explored here. Even though I don't believe this movie was written by a devout Christian, it still manages to deal with issues of free will, the corruption of absolute power, surrendering to God's will, and God's love for mankind, in very real and engaging ways that can be taken to heart by any Christian. I truly believe that Christians should watch this movie, but bear in mind that there are moments that may be offensive to some, and times that tread on borderline blasphemous, but in the end this film steers clear of that territory, and comes out on top. I did say that I feel that Christians should watch this movie, but actually anyone who is looking for a movie that will have them laughing constantly should watch ""Bruce Almighty"". I guarantee you will enjoy it.",Bruce Almighty
309,jakebriggs-69109,"Juvenile comedy, made for low brow audiences",3,22 December 2018,"Why did I hate this movie? Because it insults intelligence. Had Bruce Almighty been content to follow the well-trodden path of mindless comedies, it might have worked. After all, the scene in which Bruce embarrasses a TV anchor is genuinely funny. But director Tom Shadyac can't resist slipping into Patch Adams mode. The result is a painful final act in which Bruce learns the hard lesson that the greatest power of all is to help others. Also considering what Bruce does with God's powers, he must have an I.Q. of about 10. About a hundred good plots could have been written with this backstory - anything from a straight comedy to a tragedy, with various stops in between - but Bruce Almighty misses them all. What does Bruce do with his great powers? Use a gust of wind to flip up a woman's skirt, pull the moon closer to Earth, and move aside traffic. No stopping time. No visiting other planets. The gag of Bruce doing silly little things with his powers is amusing for about 60 seconds, then it loses its appeal.",Bruce Almighty

While Carrey's character in this film is a little less goofy than most of his parts in other movies, he still has a great way of creating crazily funny humor. I'd have to say the potty jokes are the funniest of them, but they are only one of the many different types of great comedy that helped pull this movie off. Many people, for some reason, have been disappointed by this movie. Well, I find that very ridiculous, to tell ya the truth.

It gets a little better when he starts to come to terms with the consequences of having God's powers, but the ending is predictable, saccharine in the extreme, and, worst of all:  Not funny.

It's a thinly disguised sentimental snoozer with Jim Carrey in it. ""Oh, that Jim Carrey! He's so wacky!"" Unfortunately, his act begins to seriously grate in 'Bruce Almighty' and when the inclusion of him spouting various clumps of nonsense is the only thing REMOTELY funny in this film you know it's in trouble. The music is far too syrupy and floats around in the background in a kind of ""Isn't everything so great?"" way.The plot, as I gathered it before my brain went walkies, is that Bruce fails at everything in life and decides to blame God. So God (in the form of a criminally under-used Morgan Freeman - I had a theory that any film featuring Morgan Freeman would be, at the VERY LEAST, watchable, but 'Bruce Almighty' has just blown that out of the water) comes down and gives Bruce super powers in order to show him how hard being a deity is. This opens up a huge can of worms and plotholes.Like I said earlier, this is not a comedy. There is nothing worth new or interesting in this film, except for Jim Carrey cemented his place as The Most Irritating Man Ever.",Bruce Almighty
314,Garp23,Funny but sappy,6,29 January 2004,"There are three Jim Carreys. There is the insane Jim Carrey, who starred as Ace Ventura and got `Dumb and Dumber'. There is the serious actor Carrey, who headlined `The Truman Show', `Man on the Moon', and `The Majestic'. And then there is the blended Carrey, where he takes a little of both and winds up with films like `The Mask', `Me, Myself, and Irene', and especially `Liar Liar'. All three Jim Carreys can be great, and all three Jim Carreys can be awful. `Bruce Almighty' lets Carrey blend his serious and comic sides again, and as directed by frequent collaborator and director Tom Shadyec, the duo hits more often than they miss.Some of us handle life's big disasters smoothly but flip out if we drop a pen. Others ignore the small stuff but get overwhelmed by the big stuff. Carrey's titular Bruce lets both drag him down. Like many of us have at various ages and stages in our lives, he blames God for not doing a good job of people management. He is drowning at work, his girlfriend seems ready to call it quits, and life's traffic jams and potholes filled with water, waiting to be stepped in, surround him constantly. God, here portrayed (naturally) by Morgan Freeman, calls Bruce on his complaints and hands over His powers. Bruce now, literally, is a God.At first, he focuses on getting even with those who have wronged him and making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) fall back in love with him, ignoring the prayers of all the poor schlubs like the one he used to be. The film has kicky fun letting Bruce flex and show off his powers. But he soon realizes that he actually has to help other people, and he messes everything up even worse, sending the world into utter chaos.Eventually life lessons are learned and the film gets sappy. There are many ways this film could have gone: Bruce using his powers to duke it out with God or having kinky adventures. But `Bruce Almighty' takes the mainstream road, and this is not an insult. It does everything it is supposed to do, and it does it well.Carrey provides a solid center to this film, although his mugging occasionally feels forced in a way it never did in `Liar Liar'. He introduces new catchphrases: `B-e-a-utiful' and his way of saying `It's good' and stretching out the 'oo' sound as if he were the Swedish Chef. These too seem forced; Freeman underplays an `Alrighty, then', a nod to Ace Ventura, so well that most audience members miss it, and this works much better than Carrey's antics. Aniston is saddled with the girlfriend part, in which she plays with little kids, obsesses over a photo album, and reacts to Bruce Almighty's crazy stunts. But she plays the part with such warmth and genuineness that when she hits her personal crisis, we actually feel it. This part, like `The Good Girl', proves that she should have a wonderful career after `Friends' takes its final bow.There is nothing new here. The wheel is not reinvented. But this film delivers exactly what it should: some big laughs, some good characters, and a nice day at the movies. Thank God.",Bruce Almighty

Jim Carrey delivers a hilarious performance, as always, and I believe that this is important for everyone to watch because there's a message in it. Bruce is basically a guy who thinks God is pathetic at ruling the universe. So one day, God comes along with a challenge for Bruce: He will give Bruce all of His almighty powers for Bruce to use any way he wants. Sounds pretty sweet, huh? Pretty simple? So does Bruce. As Bruce gets used to his new powers, things get much better in Bruce's life. He gets back at his backstabbing co-worker, trains his dog to use the toilet, and becomes the greatest reporter in the country. Things are great for Bruce, sounds like? Finally God tells him to answer all of the prayers people are sending him. To save time, Bruce says YES to all of them. That's when things begin to fall apart.The message this movie has for the world is that we underestimate God. We're constantly thinking of what a terrible job God is doing controlling our lives, but if we look deeper, we'll see that every link is connected to another link, and if one link breaks, the entire chain comes tumbling down. God makes our lives the way they are for a reason, and no matter how many times we think that God is not exactly doing a bang-up job, He knows what He's doing, and if we were to fix it, everything would get much worse.

Previously Jim Carey's films have seemed a bit cheesy from the trailers but the films have turned out really well. This one was the other way around.Although morality is difficult to avoid with such a strong religious theme, the film got too moral too soon. I don't really mind having a religious theme, but this presented with a detriment to the comedy.

I usually will say no to comedies targeted towards teens (i.e., stamped with a PG-13 rating), but I've never been disappointed by Carrey before (except for ""The Grinch""), so why should I now? Better than usual, really.For a Carrey film, this one is nearly flawless. Everyone's told you the plot, I don't need to tell you it. I suggest that you get yourself out of that chair in front of your computer, get into your car (or scooter, or bike, or if you're close enough, walk) and go to the theater. It's worth the ticket price, believe me. Especially if you have a choice between this and ""Dumb and Dumberer"" (*shudder*)Overall, I highly recommend this. And I'll be the first to reserve my copy of this when it comes out on DVD.My review: *** (out of four) (see my profile for details on how I rate movies)",Bruce Almighty
319,pokapamaz,Jim Carrey's Best,10,13 June 2003,"I can't believe how much this movie is underrated! This movie has excellent humor, good rhythm and straightforward plot. Some reviewers mentioned the ""religious nature,"" but this movie is not at all a ""religious cult movie,"" and it is actually the opposite. ""Bruce Almighty"" is a good example of the fact that ""humor makes sanity.""Although I noticed some resemblance to ""High Strung"" (1994, starring Steve Oedekerk), this is definitely Jim's best work so far.",Bruce Almighty
320,Ulleskelf,Jim Carrey Not Being Jim Carrey,7,22 June 2003,"I don't normally go and see Jim Carrey films.  Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey isn't good enough reason for me to get the bus to the movies and pay for popcorn.  But occasionally, he'll do a film - like as 'The Truman Show' - where he doesn't goof around - and this is one of them - and it's good.Carrey plays Bruce, a local TV reporter, who has a run of bad luck and takes it out on God, who promptly turns round and challenges him to become the Almighty for a while.  There are some really good moments and plenty of laugh out loud scenes.  The concept's good and the writing and the special effects are excellent.Jennifer Aniston's a bit of a disappointment but Morgan Freeman is fantastic as God - which, lets face it, is a role that he was born to play!  And a real life God, Tony Bennett, makes a cameo appearance.Worth going to see (and watch out for the parting of the tomato soup!)",Bruce Almighty
321,bassn99,Could have been hilarious,6,23 July 2003,"I waited for this movie with such high hopes. I was really disappointed in most of it. Don't get me wrong, it is worth watching, it has some moments. It just could have been so much more fun with a little more creativity on the part of the directors and writers. I think they missed a huge opportunity to make a hilarious movie. Instead you got just an average Jim Carey flick. I give it a 6/10.",Bruce Almighty
322,famo14n,Does Bruce Almighty have bad morals?,8,25 August 2003,"NO WAY! This movie actually has pretty good morals.  It teaches people to help other people instead of just caring about your self.  I thought it was a great movie.  It was very funny but there were only two things I didnt like about it.1)It was kind of like all other movies a guy gets a good job and a big power to control a lot of stuff but then he loses a person he loves. like a girl friend, family member or friend.2) Also the illogical part.(which I dont have a big problem with because there are a lot of illogical movies)But God would never let a sinful human ever be ans high as him and have as much power. Also If any one saw god that close they would be in awe and it would be much more dramatic. But I didnt have a big problem about it because it was just a movie.But there were things I did like about it.1)  It had good morals like I said earlier2)  It was exteremly funny.lol3) It had good acting
So your probably wondering ""so does this guy say this movies is worth watching or not?""  I would say yes it is worth the $8 to see it at the movie theater.",Bruce Almighty
323,tiff_strauss,"If you like your movies stupid and preachy, they don't get much better than this!",1,4 October 2003,"If some studio head, or person who was ivolved with this film ever reads this, I must apologize for my harsh comments which will ensue. I know that it is very difficult and time consuming to make a movie, whether it's good or bad. It demands time, more money than I care to think about, and the combined efforts of hundreds of individuals. Yet despite all the effort that goes into the production of a film like this, so many films fall under the aforementioned bad category. Bruce Almighty only supports my statement. If one were to read any of my other comments, it would be immediatly apparent that none of them are positive. I don't like to think of myself as an overly cynical person though, rather, I only review movies which in my opinion were overrated. Bruce stands proudly in line with the best of them. It could have been funny, and in fact, some parts were, yet they were all shown in the previews, and so, the movie was entirely predictable by the time I saw it. Not that this would have really mattered. This film tries to blend comedy and drama which movies like Heaven Can Wait have done in the past, and it fails miserably. You don't care what happens to Bruce, or any of the other characters, so when it goes treacly, the hands on your watch begin to move all too slowly. I feel bad putting down Bruce, for it could have been something-yet it wasn't. In addition, it had terrible production value(look at all the streets-they are all on the backlot). I am really off put by movies which act like they are important, and aren''t, and this was one of them.",Bruce Almighty
324,thefreeway2003,Being God...,8,15 April 2005,"""Bruce Almighty"" is an amusing film, which is all about a man, who basically has terrible luck in everything he does. Everyday.Produced by T.Shadyac, the cast includes Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, Jennifer Aniston as Bruce Nolan's girlfriend Grace, and Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman as God. One must say it's a darn good cast.The story begins with Bruce Nolan's daily routines. He doesn't enjoy his job, at a television channel's studio. Suddenly, someone retires from ""Live News"", and Bruce's dreams come closer. -- He passionately wants to replace him, as a new caster. All he wants to do is representing the show, and become famous around the city. But he has no luck! He couldn't be promoted. On the other hand, he starts fighting with his girlfriend, and tries to cope with his pet. Even his dog doesn't listen to him. Thus, he decides to talk to God, and tell him his troubles. Finally, and miraculously he manages to have a conversation with God. After that incredible event, Bruce gains some powers to rule the whole world for only 24 hours.The film is definitely full of funny moments, and you can also see some special effects such as; running through the sea, organizing the moon and stars, hearing the prayers of people all around the world.The cast is good, as I've pointed out before, actors give a superb performance, and the special effects are entertaining. So, I highly recommend it.",Bruce Almighty
325,Musicop,Jim Almighty,5,14 August 2003,"I don't really care to waste too many words on this film. Suffice to say that Jim Carrey plays Jim Carrey in a very one-dimensional performance. The great supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, acquit themselves nicely in fine performances. But since you, as the audience, are basically forced to empathize with a one-tone, jerk of a main character, it's very difficult to get behind the phony sentimentality of the climatic scenes. I highly recommend reading Mick LaSalle's review from the San Francisco Chronicle (www.sfgate.com and on the external reviews link of this web site) before you waste your time on this film.",Bruce Almighty

327,slint70,Throwback movie with great special effects,10,31 May 2003,"If you could take ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and add 50 million in special effects you'd be in the ballpark.  Yes Jim Carrey is funny, yes Jim Carrey is self asorbed in the beginning of the flick and yes Jim Carrey somehow gets the powers of God and Jennifer Anniston to love him.  BEAU-tiful.  This is a really good film and Morgan Freeman is perfect for the role of the Almighty. Just watch it.  SPOILERS.There were a lot of great lines , like when Bruce asks God ""how do you get someone to love you without affecting free will?"" to which God replied ""Now you know what it's like in my world, if you can answer that one let me know.""  Pretty powerful stuff.  Jim Carrey represents most people in that they are searching for things that truthfully they can give anyways, like devotion and heart to their fellow man.  But  in the beginning he is most of us in that we would love to impress our significant other in out of this world ways when in fact if they truly love you this doesn't really matter. A lot of good messages in a very entertaining format.  The script is really good in my opinion and any actor could have pulled this out as Bruce but Jim Carrey and his comic talent a plenty make this a tour de force that will be up there with the greats.......",Bruce Almighty
328,Forests,A Genuine Person Would Not Waste Absolute Power Like That,6,12 June 2003,"This movie created an idea that a screenwriter with vision and important messages could have used.  Absolute power in ""Bruce Almighty"" is wasted on a misanthrope.  The movie fails to explain how the source of all wisdom could lend its power to get things done to someone that hates his rivals and opponents.  Most irritating is the depiction of God disapproving of Nolan when he says his greatest wishes are that no person go hungry and that all mankind live in peace.  The Morgan Freeman God retorts that he is not a candidate in the Miss America contest and asks him to wish for something he really wants.  I heard a ranting political conservative in the background persuading the screenwriter to portray a God who is trusts only those so egotistic that they are incapable of emotions for people outside their own individual experience.  Perhaps Carol caadison, among others, is right: it is just a silly movie, to get a few laughs, to escape some daily grind.  I just think that escapism is already plentiful in American movies.  This was a theological idea of enormous potential.  Why does the leading critic, Roger Ebert, claim he is incapable of contemplating the theology?  Who cannot fail to perceive that God, by definition, whether actual or not, within His domain, is good?  That this serious oversight significantly detracts from the humor of ""Bruce Almighty""?",Bruce Almighty
329,Margie83,Funny...but a little risky.,8,11 June 2003,"Okay, I was very hesitant to see this movie. It looked completely sacreligious and totally out of line. I heard good things about it, so me and some girlfriends went to see it. I have to admit, it was absolutely hilarious.  There were some things that bothered me. Now, all people who have no idea about what God isare now going to have a completely wrong image of a Morgan Freeman typecharacter who doesn't take things very seriously. BUT, I MUST say, the message was good and strong. The ending strongly delivered the message of the powerof prayer to the audience. It showed how we ARE reliant on God and we oughtto just place our lives in His hands because he's the one who knows what he's doing. He's got our lives worked out and we should just accept that and trust in Him and when we screw up, He's gonna take us back. No matter how much weturn our backs, He's right behind us, holding out his arms. Bruce Almightyshowed this in a comical way. I hope that it gets across to the audience theREAL message in it. But don't worry, it's HILARIOUS! Jim Carrey is showing that he is still here doing funny faces, impressions, and being absolutely hysterical.",Bruce Almighty
330,koyaanisqatsi81,"Save yourself some time, just watch the preview.",5,23 July 2003,"I consider myself a Jim Carey fan, and I think that over the years America has fallen in love with his limber movement and unrestricted expressions, but Bruce Almighty delivers nothing more than a 41 year old Ace Ventura trying to prove he can still do it. The jokes push the envelope and leaves the religious side of the theater shifting in their chairs. The plot? What plot? There is no plot. In the end he realizes, hmm maybe I shouldn't mock God, he really does have a tough job. Keep the $7.50 in your pocket and sit on your couch. Sooner or later the preview will pop up, have a quick laugh and then go to bed. Jim, you still got it, don't let this movie get you down.",Bruce Almighty
331,nornoc19,"A moment of silence for what could have been, please",2,26 May 2003,"I looked forward to Bruce Almighty as much as the next guy. It was to be the triumphant return of Jim Carrey to the slapstick silly humor that made him famous. Instead he and the rest of the cast opened up a big old can of suck. As the movie goes, missed oppurtunities pile up, very very high. The messages preached are contradicting at times, and just plain unnecesary. Why saddle Carrey with messages when he's proven to be better without them? Ace Ventura and Dumb & Dumber are much better than LiarLiar, which Bruce Almighty is just a carbon copy of. Should've just called the film LiarLiar 2:When God Calls. Oh well, if you wanna see a good comedy, Anger Managment should still be out, and if you wanna see a good sequel which I suspect Bruce Almighty really is, see The Matrix:Reloaded. I could live the rest of my life without ever wanting to see this again, but I can't say the same about Anger Management or Reloaded. Peace out.",Bruce Almighty

The ending was a little too serious for a Jim Carrey movie, and I think that someone with God's powers would have handled his situations differently, but overall it was funny. It was probably not as funny as Ace Ventura or Liar, Liar, but it was the best movie that I have seen this year.",Bruce Almighty

334,ThiMoN,Entertaining for an hour,6,28 July 2003,"Jim Carrey may be an overrated comedian/actor, but it's in parts like this one he's just plain superb. The first 45-60 minutes of Bruce Almighty is highly entertaining. Morgan Freeman may seem wholly out of place - and he is - but you'll still get a laugh out of it if you like Mr. Carrey.Unfortunately, the last 30 minutes tend to degrade into a sloppy, sentimental hollywood-esque rubbish romantic comedy. The film loses most of it's glory when becomning too mainstream and cheasy.Carrey's as well as Aniston's performances are faultless, I suppose, but the story, which is very interesting in itself, leaves you wanting something more. Not just that run-of-the-mill ending.6 out of 10 in my booth.",Bruce Almighty
335,stnecniv,divinely well done,8,11 July 2003,"Jim Carrey is playing the 'goofy news reporter' (Bruce Nolan). He wants to make it to anchorman of the studio but is being rejected as such by the management. This reflects Carrey's successful comedy acting in real life, and when he wants to play a more serious role, 'the audience' (in general terms) doesn't recognize him in it. Jim Carrey is actually referring to his own acting history in this film and that's what gives the whole an extra dimension.Like in the Truman Show, Carrey proves in Bruce Almighty that he is a great actor and not only good at playing blimps. In my opinion he should be offered (again) a role in some good drama movies, ones in which the audience sits down and after five minutes casts aside the thought of Carrey as a comedy actor. I'm convinced that that could be a turning point. Carrey has climbed the comedy ladder to the very top that he is forced to make a giant fall to level up with an actor like Williams when he plays a drama role. This last one is great at comedy, but he also has an audience for the more serious roles (which can still contain some humor) like in Good Will Hunting for example.Go watch this movie, you won't regret it! If only to enjoy the great (and cute) acting of Jennifer Aniston.I rate this movie a positive 8/10.",Bruce Almighty
336,melaniejbaker2003,"If this is a comedy, shouldn't it be funny?",4,11 September 2003,"This is a nice idea, and has some funny moments (Bruce teaching the dog to pee, and testing his godlike powers of seduction) but really isn't as funny as it should be. It relies far too heavily on Carrey's frantic mugging and face-pulling for laughs, and doesn't bother to flesh out the characters. We are clearly meant to sympathise with Bruce and find him fundamentally decent, but the character is whiny, self-obsessed and petulant. Jennifer Aniston is completely wasted as his girlfriend, in a part that is criminally under-written, and the movie's tone veers uncomfortably between slapstick and sentimentality.The film's problem is that it's too formulaic. It ends with a typically hollywood ""isn't it nice how we've all grown?"" moment that will make the more cynical viewer (in which category I include myself) feel a little queasy from the sugar overload.",Bruce Almighty
337,nvdw,Could someone pass Shadyac some cojones?,4,14 April 2005,"(Repeated line in the DVD director's commentary: ""We cut that scene, 'cause we wouldn't want to hurt any people."") Tom Shadyac seems to have a knack for completely inoffensive, high morale, family valued, junk food comedy features: hence Liar Liar, Ace Ventura, you know the bunch. Bruce Almighty is in the same league, but fails to be funny for the entire length of the movie. Instead, it is a moralizing piece of bull that could have been so much better, if only Tom Shadyac wouldn't have listened to his stupid focus group audience.Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a reporter for the Buffalo local news station, but he's fed up with making reports about low-rent, trivial subjects like he's (apparently) been doing for the last few years. Instead, his goal is to become the anchor of the news station and become Buffalo's own Walter Cronkite. When his slimy colleague Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) snitches his beloved job opportunity from under his very nose, Bruce starts a rage against God, blaming him for all the misery he's in. Consequently, God (Morgan Freeman) grants Bruce all his powers, so he can prove that he can do a better job.Of course, this leads to the usual series of hilarious events, but suddenly, the script demands a more serious approach. Enough with all the mild Bible jokes, it's time for some tear-jerking morale! I don't mind the morale, but why does it take Shadyac half a movie to make his statement? There is absolutely *nothing* to laugh about in the second bit of Bruce Almighty, and that's the first reason why it fails to be a good comedy.The second reason is Shadyac's enduring fear to offend people. The film would have been a lot better if only he had the bloody cojones to ignore the complaints of the ruddy focus group. How could a simple God joke be offensive, when thousands of Christians approve of a movie where Jesus Christ is beaten to a pulp for two hours (Gibson's Passion of the Christ)? The only thing I find offensive about Bruce Almighty, is the way Carrey's character behaves to his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston in a stereotype cast) and gets away with it. Just like Maura Tierney in Liar Liar, Aniston has to play a woman who simply loves an insulting, betraying, generally mistreating jerk. For that I don't blame God (for I'm not Bruce), but Shadyac. Family values, tssk.",Bruce Almighty
338,teem,Funny and dramatic despite Jim Carrey,6,28 May 2003,"What a pleasure seeing a summer comedy that didn't gross me out or insult my intelligence. And despite the over-the-top scenes in the trailer and the premise the movie actually follows through on the messages that actions have consequences and that you need to learn what is important in life.Morgan Freeman was great and was able to swing between the serious and the silly with Carrey. Jennifer Aniston was really good with her somewhat limited character. The rest of the cast were nice in the various character roles. I just think the movie could have been improved by substituting some other comedian for Carrey. His over-the-top style actually slowed the movie down in places--for example, the diner scene or his remote-control payback at the TV studio. I will admit that his reaction when everything comes crashing down around him was really nice, though. In fact, the climax gave me the welcome surprise of not copping out of the situation that had been set up. It was a better film than I expected.Rating: matinee with popcorn (7/10)",Bruce Almighty

I wanted this movie to be funny, but in reality very few scenes were. I thought this movie would be a comedy, and stay a comedy, but by the end of the film, it was a dramatic film about true feelings.

After all, any movie with Freeman as God has to be pretty good, right?  Perhaps not.  While Freeman did once again fail to let me down, Carrey's performance was below average.  However, when given a script that wasn't all that spectacular, one man can only do so much. Perhaps had I looked a little closer to see that Steve Oedekerk had been involved in the script, whose other cinematic failures include Kung Pow (also known as The Dumbest Movie in Existence), I wouldn't have been let down that much.  Carrey was the best he could have been, but there's only so much he could do to save this.  Steven Carrell had one of the best scenes in the movie, but even that was only able to entertain briefly before the gag just kept dragging on.

352,claws0922,Carrey is just right,8,25 May 2003,"I really wanted to like this movie. However, I admit I was worried that all the good stuff was in the trailer. My fears were laid to rest in the first 10 minutes, and I settled in to Carrey's best movie since Liar Liar.
Jim Carrey seems to have finally found the line where being too zany hurts his work, and he does not cross it here. His Bruce Nolan character is very believable and a likeable guy. He doesn't dream of being a big star in New York, he'll settle for Buffalo. I thought his reactions to not getting the anchor job, and his general feeling of ""God is against me"" were right on target and something a lot of us go through at times. I'm not saying Carrey shouldn't do straight drama, but this type of film his obviously his niche.I do not, however, want to forget Jennifer Anniston. I've read some reviews that have basically said ""well, she's not bad for the film, just not good for it either"". I disagree. Yes she's beautiful, but in my opinion she's got an every woman quality to her that make her seem like someone you could know. I believe she's got a long, lucrative film career ahead of her.Finally let me add these things:If God really is the way Morgan Freeman portrays him we're all gonna be ok. - Catherine Bell is gorgeous and I think she'd be a great bad girl/seductress in a film even more so than she is here. -Everyone should give proper credit to Steven Carrell for the on-air scene where Bruce messes with him.

I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG!!!Now don't get me wrong.  Little kids will love it and the religious right will embrace this movie as an undeniably factual document proving the existence of a higher power, but there isn't much here for the movie-goer who's looking for something genuinely funny. Most of the humor boils down to Carrey enunciating a certain word, people falling down or getting hurt, and a ""zany"" catch phrase delivered by Bruce at the end of his newscasts.  There's not much else except for a few very random yet mildly clever moments.  Oh yeah...Carrey curses God excessively throughout the first half of the film to the point where it completely obnoxious and unnecessary.  (I don't even believe in God and it got on my nerves.)This movie is disappointing and weak on many levels.  Don't believe me? Go see for yourself.",Bruce Almighty
355,starchild81,Very good,8,5 June 2003,"Bruce Almighty is a very good movie.  It's full of laughs and is just an all around good time...although I must add that Jim Carrey has without a doubt made funnier movies.  In my opinion My, Myself & Irene was better, but you really should go see Bruce either way.  8 stars!",Bruce Almighty
356,SingingAnalyst,"funny, sensitive, entertaining",7,25 May 2003,"Jim Carrey's role in Bruce reminded me in some ways of his role in The Truman Show: He plays a lighthearted, joy-giving TV personality in a movie which touches on issues of the divine and free will. Perhaps Carrey enjoys these roles; I certainly think he is funny and I liked his role in Bruce, just as I liked his role in The Truman Show.I also thought Jennifer Aniston did well as Grace, devoted (and devout) and tender partner to Bruce.I thought the movie was well put together, featuring humor and sensitivity. Aniston's character goes through quite a range of emotions with respect to her relationship with Bruce. Jim Carrey, though, carries the film with his humor, passion, sensitivity and his portrayal of a character with an innocent love of life.",Bruce Almighty

Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one which just happens to be Jennifer Annisten being the funny one.  It is typical Jim Carrey humor and it is really funny.  Just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised.  All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies this is a must-see, otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied.",Bruce Almighty

The movies I have seen, I usually get sucked into by accident. I like when he tries dramatic stuff. The Majestic was one of the best movies I had seen in a long time.I wanted to see this because I like Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman. It had an interesting premise that I was drawn to. My fiancée made comments about hearing me giggling. He was in another room.It was fun and made me feel good when it ended. I loved it. I'm a Little House on the Prairie fan, too.

360,BubblyHoopla9,Hilarious! Loved every minute of it!,6,23 May 2004,"I always love Jim Carreys movies, and this is one of his greatest. I've seen How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Liar Liar, The Majestic, The Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and have loved them all. He never ceases to make me laugh. For example, if some other actor tried to do a remake of Bruce Almighty, it wouldn't work because it is impossible to copy Jim Carrey even if you were his clone. But on to another actor. Morgan Freeman is a great God. He is just so calm and cool and you just can't help but love him. God really must have blessed him, because he had a superb performance, Oscar worthy in my opinion, but of course the Oscar will go to Jim Caviesel as Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ"". Jennifer Aniston did a great job in the role she has done 19 times. Don't get me wrong, Jennifer's great, but she just does the same ""Rachel"" role over and over and over. But who doesn't love Rachel on ""Friends"". I thought this movie had a great plot, i mean ""What if God was one of us?"". They carried the plot greatly, showing a man on the verge of suicide, not getting the recognition he deserves, then gets Gods powers and fixes everything wrong in his life, while getting ample air time on the news and earning the name ""Mr.Exclusive"", but then realizes the job is harder than he thought because, turns out, you can't just help yourself. Is on the verge of suicide again, and doesn't want the job anymore, and tells people that you have to ""Be the Miracle"" and fixes his life by helping himself. Great movie, a great Shadyac film, i give it 10/10.",Bruce Almighty

If you're looking for Jim Carey the good actor (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Lemony Snicket's), you won't find that either.What you get here is a cookie cutter Hollywood comedy which is cute, obvious, and doesn't make you think too much.. or at all.The plot is simple.. ordinary nice guy becomes unhappy with his life, complains about the lousy way that god is running the universe... ZING, in pops Morgan Freeman to teach him a thing or two about what being god is all about... Which he does.. but there are no particularly deep ideas here, just pure sitcom entertainment. The major characters are all fairly well acted and there are some cute scenes eg where ""Bruce"" tries different ways to deal with gods huge backlog of prayers to be answered. In short, I would watch this movie again if I was really bored or home sick from work and it happened to be on TV. It's cute, as far as it goes.. which isn't too far.

362,WannaKnow,One of the worst films I've seen,3,7 March 2005,"Bad, bad, bad. I expected more of Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman. Those are great actors, but the film is horrible. I expected more of this film. The story takes place in Buffalo, with Bruce (Jim Carrey), that works on a news channel. He gets fired and says that God is the responsible of everything. Eventually, God calls him and gives the work of being God to Bruce. I though that this would be a great film, but it wasn't. After watching it, I though I had lost two hours of my life. And it was true. It's not even funny. I don't know what happened to the director, the same who did Liar, Liar (another with Jim Carrey). Liar, liar was a great movie but this wasn't. I think Morgan Freeman should think more carefully the next time of picking a movie for acting. The only good think of the movie are the actors, that's why I voted 3. But everything else, it's horrible. Don't watch this movie. You'll lose your time. Seriously, this is one of the worst films I've seen.",Bruce Almighty

It's a pretty comic film filled with fantasy. However, from a religious point of view, i cannot fully accept it as a ""legitimate"" idea to put the Lord in a human form (Morgan Freeman), or tell that He was ""on vacation"" during the dark ages !!! Actually i would have appreciated posing the same idea of the film (which is great by the way) in a less abstractive form if you know what i mean.

When I left, I was absolutely amazed by this simple film, in the midst of all the over-the-top box office thrill rides, and sequels.  I'm not a Jim Carrey fan per say, but he certainly hit it out of the park with this one. I don't want to give the story away, but if you want to see a great movie, this is a must see.  Stop what your doing and do yourself a favor, and go and see it!!!",Bruce Almighty
367,dragonfire_777,You have Prayers ...,9,29 May 2003,I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal.  His character is like all of us.  Wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliver.Morgan Freeman made a great God.  With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry's basically self-centered TV anchorman wanna-be but that's the way it was written.I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened.I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep.  This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.A funny film.,Bruce Almighty

They really worked well together!  The had moments of humor, and surprisingly some touching scenes as well!  Morgans performance was also very solid!  You would think there would not be much to do with this kind of character, but he brings a certain presence to the character...(I think it's in his voice!).The film is good hearted and made me want more of Jim's antics when I left the theatre.

The film overall was extremely funny, witty with an interesting fantasy storyline, some of the scenes had me in stitches, one being the tv report at the falls. I thought Carrey played the part great showing as much enthusiasm to make people laugh as he does in his other films. If you like Jim Carrey, without a doubt you should see this film. I gave it 8/10, it's really good and enjoyable, it's perhaps not on the same par as dumb and dumber (but what comedy's are?).",Bruce Almighty

Bruce almighty is not just a typical Carrey slap-stick comedy.  It's much more than that.  I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan but I found this movie to be both funny and thought provoking. Like when Bruce asks God why can't you make somebody love you and God answers, ""If you figure that one out let me know"".  The whole prayers ordeal was also powerful.  I found myself misty eyed toward the end as Bruce Almighty changes as he sees things in a different light.  I loved this film for how it made me think and feel. I gave it 9 out of 10.

None of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end, I dont know what the writers were thinking. Somehow I couldn't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re-creating Liar Liar.On a positive note, The Daily Show's Steve Correl is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast.

He uses his powers basically to get his own career back on track, I won't say anymore but I would recomend seeing it with maybe some mates os you can talk during to movie.But I would say wait for it on DVD, Video or TV. Its not unmissable and not the type of film that would have you rushing to the cinema!6/10",Bruce Almighty
377,HowlingSnail,"A ""pleasurable"" film with a lot of lost potential.",8,4 May 2015,"I'll admit, my experience with Jim Carrey movies isn't large, but of the ones I've seen, this is definitely my favourite of the bunch.The film follows Bruce Nolan, a news reporter who's fed up with his life. He's stuck doing the boring stories, such as reporting on Buffalo's biggest cookie. What he really wants is the job as an anchor on the evening news. When the job opens up, and he doesn't get it, he vents his rage, which results in him losing his job, and getting beaten up by a gang of thugs.Bruce blames God for his misfortune, so in response, God decides to teach him a lesson, by giving him all his powers, with his only two limitations being that he can't tell anyone about it, or affect free will.What follows is about half an hour of Bruce indulging in his powers. Whether it's making his girlfriend orgasm from the sound of his voice, punishing the gang of thugs that beat him up, or messing with the man who stole his job to get him fired, if Bruce wants it, it happens.The problem is what happens next. Bruce girlfriend Grace becomes disheartened with how much of a selfish dick he's become (Or rather, how much of a selfish dick he's always been, but now he can express it more), and leaves him. After that, the entire rest of the film becomes about Bruce moping around, and trying to get her back.Now, I have no problem with having a little bit of romance in this movie. The problem is the mix. The movie spends just as much time, if not more, on Bruce's failing love life, as it does on the promised Godly antics. I watched his movie expecting a man to have fun being God, rather than it being about him losing his girlfriend and trying to win her back.The thing is, it didn't have to be that way. Between the deleted scenes available on the DVD, and more scenes that are in the script (some of which were filmed, as revealed by production photos), there was plenty of content that could have been done to stretch out the ""Bruce enjoys his powers"" bit of the movie, so that the movie was closer to what was actually advertised.Because that's my biggest gripe with the movie; it's unrealistic. Now, I can understand that, despite it being the most realistic situation, this movie can't be 90% sex, since age ratings and all, but I don't believe what we got was realistic even with that proviso. I've mentioned before that the entire last half hour of the movie is Bruce trying to win his girlfriend back. He can't just force her to take him back, due to his inability to edit free will, but did it never occur to him to just erase her memory of what he did? Or just re-wind time to stop it happening in the first place? Especially as Bruce himself said that God could just ""clean everything up in 5 minutes if he wanted to"".It's these faults that ruin the movie for me, and prevent it from being perfect. Despite this, it's one of my favourite movies, and I do recommend it, if only so you, like me, can wish God would give you his powers too.",Bruce Almighty

385,aireent,Heavenly Funny !!!,10,2 June 2003,"Jim Carrey's 'Bruce Almighty' was downright hilarious and funny. The movie's heavenly entertaining.This may sound like a cliché but the film somehow sends a timely message (well at least for me). Let's bring forth selfish versus selfless, almighty versus humanity and the simple pleasures life offers. Grace is a woman who totally commits herself in full support to the man she loves. A life that is considered mediocre though somehow content and living a day at a time underplays this. And in the heart of this a man named Bruce constantly whines, constantly seeks self-fulfillment and self-satisfaction. A man who upholds the I, ME, Mine principle. A man always wanting more and getting more without realizing his self-worth in giving laughter and simple joys. Yes, he is Bruce Nolan, a local Eyewitness News TV reporter in Buffalo, New York, best known for doing humorous, homespun, human interest stories. Yet this being a job doesn't carry and make him feel up in cloud nine. There's nothing wrong with making a goal and dreaming big but at the rate he's handling it? I guess not. So when he doesn't get that much-anticipated promotion he boils down on national TV and eventually gets fired. So as that 'fateful' day goes out bad, string of disasters follow through. And how does Bruce handle it? As much as he never misses to whine about it. That's what exactly he does best. So he takes it out to God when things do not happen the way he expects it to be. There he goes, blame it on the Big Man upstairs. So then what happens? God in a nondescript utility outfit beckons him and reveals himself. He then willingly obliges to endow Bruce with His powers and tells him to be in charge. Lucky Bruce you'd say. Except sometimes it's not easier as it seems. Soon Bruce discovers that being God and being in charge is more than meets the eye. Learning how to weigh consequences is indeed as paramount as to giving in to everyone's whims and desires. It entails command beyond power. And as he learns to deal with the voices in his head he realizes that getting more and wanting more aren't precisely his life's intent.Jim Carrey's tailored fit role as he alone does so well is perfect as the Almighty reliever. He's naturally endearing as this cocky and flamboyantly self-centered newsman. He carries himself in such charming ways his bemused and outlandish funny role. Meantime Morgan Freeman plays God in all his might as effortless as ever and somehow possesses this Omni presence that hovers mankind. Jennifer Aniston does her character well as Grace the simple and patient girlfriend of Bruce.I guess Bruce is in each of one us as we challenge God from time to time and try to be in control of our lives. Only then do we trace back our humanity, trust our heart and discover real happiness. So trust your humanity to the almighty. Because after all we can all become our own miracles.",Bruce Almighty

Bruce's career is in jeopardy and -strangley- decides it's all god's fault.  Finally he meets god and god tells him that he will be endowed with all his powers.  However, this leads to many philosophical problems.First of all, god is supposed to be omnipotent...why is it god has to follow the 2 rules: no one can know you're god, you cannot mess with freewill. By this very reasoning, the idea of god-omnipotent is defeated.
This movie is fundamentally flawed on so many levels...so many loopholes. I won't even get into the Yahweh(Yahoo) email service!!! I did get a couple of chuckles out of the dog/bathroom scene...and the monkey flying out of that guys butt, but the philosophical problems were too distracting for me to really enjoy it.See this if there is nothing else to watch.

Brilliant man. However, this movie is sadly half- um... donkeyed. The story is incredibly uninteresting and ultimately anti-climactic. People often describe disappointing comedies by saying, ""All the good jokes were in the preview,"" and in this case it's true. Which is even more pathetic when you consider that the preview was pretty unamusing. A dog using a toilet! ha. ha. Seriously, it is a crime how much screen time is wasted on that dog. Somehow the creators seemed to think that the humor of this film was in the lame special effects, and not the brilliantly funny comedian who stars. Morgan Freeman is at times, well... embarrassing. Who does he think he is, Jim Carrey? Toss in some sickly saccharine lessons of morality and there's your big summer blockbuster Carrey comedy. It's really a shame when the funniest moment in a Jim Carrey movie comes not from the star, but from Daily Show anchor, Steve Carell. His scene of vocal manipulation had me with tears in my eyes. But rather than redeem this film, it made me wish I was watching the Daily Show instead. Unfortunate.",Bruce Almighty

It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths.  He won't get an Academy Award but the film itself will last longer than many of the ""awarded films"" of the Academy.  He is at the top of his form in this most recent film - it's like the return of an old friend.Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, superb comic timing, and obviously having fun together but without the ""hey mom - look how funny I am"" type of comedy.  A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrey's nemesis (Carrell of The Daily Show fame), who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film. I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the past three years.I can foresee the religious nuts in the US will be up-in-arms over the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will.  Without Married With Children t o complain about, this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities (who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on Sunday morning and late nigh television, selling prayers to God).  And, again, about 0.5% of the country will care and 80% of the media will report it.The bottom line: this a purely entertaining film, each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do, and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion.  A walk down any major street in America has to confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor.  What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry.Thanks again, Jim -- it's GREAT to have you back!!",Bruce Almighty
394,tom-760,Very entertaining film,7,26 May 2003,"I had seen various trailers for this movie, and I liked the premise and had high hopes that it would be an enjoyable movie.  I was a little worried that it might border on heresy, but it looked like it would be very funny.  I was not disappointed.  The movie was quite enjoyable from start to finish.As for the heresy part - I was certainly not offended in the least by the portrayal of God in this film.  While I certainly don't think God would ever turn his powers over to someone like Bruce, everything else about the way Morgan Freeman portrayed God was perfectly acceptable, and in fact I thought his was the best performance of the movie.While some felt the message of this movie was sappy or overdone, I really liked it.  I really don't have a problem with a comedy trying to be something more than just humor, in fact I appreciate it when a movie of any genre tries to encourage people to be more than what they are.  The message about prayer in this film was dead on, IMHO.One final comment, the news anchor scene with Steven Carell was one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any movie.  I laughed so hard that it hurt (and so did most everyone else in the theater), and there are only a few comedy sequences I can ever remember that even approach that.  That scene alone is worth the price of admission.Tom",Bruce Almighty

Me likey.Morgan Freeman plays God, a good choice, Freeman is a premier actor. With all these names, this movie should be top notch.... Too bad it isnt. The laughs come, very few and far between. When I did laugh, I laughed hard, but when I didn't... I wanted to die.

397,madmark118,Liar Liar Imitator,8,25 June 2003,"If you liked Liar Liar you will like this movie.  First of all let me say that I found both Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty extremely funny.  There are many parallels between the two movies. For example, they both:1. use a fantastic premise to set up most of the comedy2. are extremely funny for the first half of the film, and have almost no laughs during the last half hour while they wrap up the plot3. star Jim Carrey4. feature a love interest played by a female star from an NBC sitcom5. have a sexy, malicious woman trying to sleep with Jim Carrey6. end on a syrupy-sweet Capraesque note7. were directed by the same person, Tom Shadyac8. show the main character the error of his ways through the absurd premise9. feature a series of outtakes during the end creditsSo while I can appreciate Bruce Almighty on its own I'd like to see a slightly bigger difference between them.  As for picking the better of the two, I think Liar Liar was outrageously funny more often.There was one scene in this movie were I laughed so hard I cried.  It's just too bad that they had to have a lame plot to string the scenes together. Also there are two scenes in the movie, when Jim is using his Godlike powers, where they seemed to spend a lot of time and money on bits that weren't even funny (tomato soup and Post-It Notes).  In the end there's one undeniable reason to see this movie: Jim Carrey is hilarious.",Bruce Almighty

I'm pagan myself and try my best to understand and accept other religions, but this was WAY too ""in your face"" blatant christian preaching for me.

Mexicans (Latin's etc.) are the new danger. They are dangerous gang members - lets ridicule them. Russians are unhygienic cynical and are to be avoided.The film is full of it.

The movie is very moving and funny and also manages to make a quiet statement about not taking what you have in life for granted and being happy with yourself and your choices.Some people may consider Bruce Almighty corny but I thought it was done very well and managed to make it's point without coming across as preachy.What also surprised me was how much I enjoyed Jim Carey's performance. I had seen some of his other work and couldn't say I was very impressed but he was very good in this. Maybe it's because, for the first time I felt rather then just being very in your face funny he was actually ACTING-and he proved himself to be a pretty good actor. Anniston to did a surprisingly sweet performance as Bruce's girlfriend and Morgan was PEREFECTLY cast as God.This was a movie that had me laughing SO hard but crying too-beautifully done without being at all overdone Bruce Almighty is a perfect movie choice. 10 of 10.",Bruce Almighty

403,prabato,Bruce.. I am God :),10,2 October 2005,"OK, I love this movie. I like that it has a deep spiritual message that is conveyed through simple symbolism. Everyone of us is trying to fight back and have some resistance against Life's will that is naturally for our good. This movie is just for everyone. Rarely does anybody stop fighting life back. We should all submit to Life's will.I guess this movie succeeds in bringing the message clear and effective without mixing it with any sort of religion. I give it 10/10 for:1. The power of the message (a spiritual message). 2. The true sense of equality (God is black. Why not?) 3. Simplicity of symbolism & Good Acting!",Bruce Almighty

Blech!",Bruce Almighty
406,bhartman33,"A Really Good Film, For What It Is",7,25 November 2006,"First of all, a little suggestion: If you're expecting ""The Mask"", or ""Ace Ventura"", then just move along. Nothing to see here. This isn't that kind of comedy. (It's arguable, in fact, that it's less a comedy than an idea movie, of sorts).Carrey gives an admirable performance as a self-absorbed mediocrity in the beginning of the film. He's having a bad day, and towards the end of it, you start to wonder what Anniston's character (""Grace"", fittingly enough) sees in him. At that point in the movie, it's pretty difficult to watch, because you don't have any real sympathy. So Bruce gets a page (on his pager) from God, and after the requisite (for this kind of movie) skepticism, takes on God's job for a week.There are obvious problems with the premise. If someone ever really did acquire the omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence of God which is presumably the heart of His job, that person would be able to handle the tasks put before Bruce. It's one of the movie's conceits (essentially mandated by the Christian philosophy undergirding the movie) that Bruce is given God's responsibilities without being given his omnipotence. If Bruce were given true omnipotence (let alone omniscience), there wouldn't be much of a movie, so that is a necessary evil.In my mind, this movie isn't so much a comedy as it is a love story -- albeit mostly an unrequited love story. Grace, Bruce's long-suffering girlfriend, obviously loves Bruce, and is there for him. The cliché breakup and their even-more-cliché reconciliation aren't really the climactic points of their relationship, within the movie. That climax happens when Bruce listens to Grace's prayers after their breakup, and in how he reacts to them (which I won't spoil for anyone). I've seen the movie twice so far, and that scene towards the end of the film always makes me tear up.In short, the comedy in this movie isn't great, and Anniston herself isn't given much to do. (A significant amount of her character's depth comes from what Bruce sees or hears *about* her, rather than *from* her.) The physical comedy is good, but not great. (i.e., it's not ""The Mask"") The thing that, to me, makes the movie worth watching is Bruce's initial fun with his powers, watching the consequences of that fun, and his eventual epiphany at the end concerning what it really means to love Grace.Not a perfect film, but certainly worth watching.",Bruce Almighty

This movie is no different. This movie is funny, in fact very funny at times but is sometimes just plain stupid. There is too much focus on the love story and way too much god cliché. If the movie cut back on the clichés and had more jokes and less philosophy it would be much funnier. I also feel that there should have been more steve carrel and morgan freeman in the movie to make it better. I would finally like to point out that morgan freeman fit the god character the best out of any actor that i have seen play god.

There is an important underlying message made clear when Bruce asks God ""How do I get her to love me?"" God says, ""When you figure that out, let me know"".  Does God really not know? I'll let you decide, but FREE WILL is a powerful force.  We see this same struggle carried out in other films that make no mention of God.  Two people struggle to find out if they truly love each other.  The man is a selfish jerk and the woman tries to wait for him to get real.  Remember Hugh Grant in 9 Months?

As a fan of Jim Carrey's films, I usually enjoy his bathroom onomatopoeia, sophomoric rants and physical comedy.  However, I found myself wanting to laugh at this film with its great premise, but just couldn't bring myself to.  Morgan Freeman was quite good as God, but Carrey seemed to be trying to be even more self-consciously funny than usual (and that's saying a lot)!

413,nic_o,Disappointing,4,3 July 2003,"Why did I go to see this film? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? Additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston's involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside  encouraged me.However, as my ""one line Summary"" suggests, I was Disappointed. For various reasons;Reason 1: It wasn't funny. In a 2hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking ""I really should have got some ice-cream"". I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gem's such as 'The Truman Show' , 'Liar Liar' , 'Me, Myself and Irene' , 'Dumb and Dumber' , 'The Mask', and the 'Ace Ventura' films then produces, in Bruce Nolan's own words, such a mediocre film?Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! She's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.Reason 3: One word - ClichéReason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal. ""A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!"" God tells Bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. Additionally, I still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.",Bruce Almighty

That may be a lot to ask from a stupid movie and Not-So-Mighty Bruce isn't able to deliver. It doesn't realize that just by having Jim Carey involved makes it a Holy Endeavor. They stupidly have to overshadow Jim's natural comedic superpowers with humbling Almighty Power. The idea that grown people believe in a Being whose role is more vital than that of a common human is both infantile and depressing. If you believe in a higher power in a human form, you're too silly for words. If you need to believe in an all-knowing, all-powerful man-like master, then you will ALWAYS be deceived and scammed... Just like when you willingly gave up your hard earned $10 for this bit of tame, uninspired, predictable, Christian pablum.

Like the rival anchor man contender being forced to talk nonsense and make funny faces (which is technically messing with free if you ask me, still funny though), the Jimmy Hoffa discovery and the Clint Eastwood imitation are all simply hilarious. These miniature Carrey-sketches saves the movie from being just totally ridiculous. None of the other actors make great appearances and the plot is more or less the blueprint of 10,000 other light Hollywood comedies. It gets sappy and uninspiring at the end too.

You should not watch this movie if you get offended, or don't like the idea of movies portraying praying,and spirituality. It does have some innaproprate things but still, Jim Carrey, as always will make it more humorous.",Bruce Almighty
429,hannah-158,Not as good as I thought it would be,4,6 February 2006,"When I went down to the local video shop as I do most Fridays I happened to glance upon Bruce Almighty. I had of course heard of it before but that day was the day I decided to finally watch it. Being a Jim Carrey fan I was excited and thought it would be a good movie as the plot was original and I also happen to like Morgan Freeman. I'm not sure if it was my high expectations that ruined the movie of the fact that is just wasn't that great. A few 'run of the mill' type jokes, and it dragged on a bit without much interesting happening a couple of times. Still, it is a good 'blob out infront of the TV' type movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who has nothing to do, or wants a movie to fall asleep infront of.4 out of 10 (and yes, I still like Jim Carrey)",Bruce Almighty
430,honor2god,Great Movie,10,16 August 2018,"I loves the movie as it shows the truth about people complaining to God, Who is always near and ready to listen, but people prefer to try doing thing the hard way. Great play of Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman.",Bruce Almighty
431,emallla555,Funny stuff,9,22 April 2006,"The thing about jim carrey is that he makes most movies pretty entertaining. This movie seemed a little shallow though. I think the more important question. If you were given the powers in this movie. How would you play god? Well anyhow its an interesting premise. Funny how the god was saying he needed a break from work. The dark ages, lol. I think also the part about parting soup was great. Just really a funny and lovable movie for some quick laughs. I think the little transitions of the movie are also quite good. the way jim changes stuff and they move the camera to show the instant change. Funny. This certainly will be fun for the whole family. Watch.",Bruce Almighty
432,lesb-2,All the laughs aren't in the commercials or trailer,6,22 May 2003,"I either like or hate Jim Carrey.  I thought ""The Mask"" was genius, completely enjoyed ""Liar, Liar"", ""The Majestic"" was good, but I haven't liked most of Carrey's other flix.  I was not looking forward to ""Bruce Almighty"".  Still, when my wife and I got the opportunity to attend the world premiere of the movie earlier this week right here in Buffalo, I found myself very pleasantly surprised.  The movie was very, very funny. Despite myself, I was laughing nearly all the time.  There were moments of over-the-top mugging, but they were blessedly short.  Carrey's character hit close to home - who of us hasn't had ""one of those days"" and felt God wasn't on our side.  Jennifer Aniston, provided a real character far from her Rachel personna, and was lovely to look at besides.  I've heard Morgan Freeman doesn't want to discuss his portrayal of GOD, but I think he handled it well - far differently and with more humor than others who have attempted the same role.  Supporting cast was good especially the fellow who played the news anchor whose job Carrey's character felt he should have - the news broadcast scene is howl.  All round a fun movie with humor and a message - I recommend it.  It's a shame neither Carrey nor Aniston attended the premiere - but then again this is Buffalo and much as for Carrey's character, Buffalo gets no respect.  4 of 5 stars.",Bruce Almighty

436,nstauffer,That's the way the cookie crumbles.,10,1 October 2006,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. It follows the life of Bruce, a typical 30 year old who lives with his girlfriend. One day, when his life seems to be going down the tubes, someone pages him. Bruce ignores the paging. The paging continues however. It hardly seems to stop. One day, Bruce tries calling the number that keeps paging him. It leads him to a warehouse that turns out is like a gateway to heaven. God shows Bruce the sins he's committed. Bruce thinks that God sucks, and God gives Bruce all of his powers to give Bruce a chance to redeem himself. At the beginning of the movie, Bruce thinks the powers are for playing with. He ""parts the Red Sea"", makes a monkey come out of a guy's butt, and other nonsense like that. Then, he starts to realize that being God is no piece of cake. He accidentally lets everyone have whatever they want, and the world turns into hell. Bruce realizes then that he has to fix this all. He doesn't know how to. When he goes back to the warehouse to get God's help, God is not there. Bruce is all alone, the world is hell, and all of a sudden, Bruce gets hit by a truck. He goes up to heaven and tells God he's sorry. When God asks Bruce to pray. Bruce starts by goofing off, but then realizes that's not right. He says he wants his girlfriend to be happy, to find someone that's good to her. God grants his wish, and all of a sudden, he's back on Earth in a hospital bed with his girlfriend by his side. This movie made me laugh, cry, and taught me spiritually that, as hard as life on Earth is, its harder to be God. This is officially the greatest movie of all time, and ""that's the way the cookie crumbles""",Bruce Almighty
437,GreenDay3144,Bruce,8,26 November 2006,This movie shows a lot of good that the way that Jim Carrie can act. I thought that although it was very funny this movie also had some meaning to it that many people did not see.When it starts out Bruce is a guy who always thinks that the world owes him and that he is owed something by some one. He is a simple man searching for a simple meaning to life and all he wants is a better life because what he thinks is that he has a bad one right now even though he does not. The bum with the signs is almost a play by play of what Bruce is not really seeing when he should be. He thinks his live is average and wants a boost so god played by Morgan free man wants him to take his spot for a little while to see if he still thinks its easy and to understand how hard someone else life can be. After a tough time with having the powers of god Bruce finally figures out that he should have been thankful for what he had because he might not ever get it back even if he really tries because sometimes bad decisions can last for ever. I thought that the acting was really good in this movie and it showed how Bruce converted from being someone who wanted a lot of like to someone in the end who knows that he should just take life one day at a time and be thankful for what he has,Bruce Almighty
438,biggameballer226,Review,7,7 December 2006,"After first watching this movie at the theaters, I thought that Bruce Almighty was a complete waste of my money because it was not nearly as funny as I thought it would be. I felt like all the good parts of this film was shown during its upcoming previews--I hate that. Once I saw this movie for a second time in my writing class, however, I now feel like Bruce Almighty actually features some intriguing aspects in relevance to conversion. Throughout the film, it appears as if Bruce's problem is that he loses the love of his life, Grace, and is desperately urging to get her back, but, in reality, Bruce's real problem is his utterly egotistical nature that virtually blinds him of seeing all the good that he already has in his life. Also, when one thinks about it, Bruce's selfishness is a virtual mirror image of what American society has become and been for quite some period of time: all about me, me, and me first.",Bruce Almighty
439,peterandcarlie,A very enjoyable movie and a great conversation starter,8,28 December 2006,"This is a good, fun movie. It does what it says on the tin and does it well. It has lots of laughs with Jim Carey as his usual funny self, and Steve Correll as the comedic icing on the cake. Morgan Freeman is great as God. Yes, it is slightly clichéd in parts (see the stereotpyically stupid street gang) but, hey, it doesn't claim to be Shakespeare! It is also a great discussion starter on matters of faith as it deals with a number of Christian themes: why does God allow suffering, free will, God's providence, our fallen state, being content with the gifts you have been given, to name but a few.",Bruce Almighty

Only Bruce's underwear lowered my pleasure of this movie.Anyway, this was a good movie of how selfish and self-centered one can be. Maybe this raises a question, is that why also we are blaming God for all the bad thinks there are in our lives?And those pearls for praying - where does that come from? And every time there comes a religious movie, it's packed full with God-stuff, like parting the red sea, walking on the water...

Jim Carrey is at his best here. He is WAY more likeable than I've ever seen him. The supporting cast deserves a lot of credit too. If you like Carrey, you'll like this movie. If you don't like him what's wrong with you? Ah well, to each her/his own. For those of you who rush out of the theater, stick around for some hilarious outtakes, you dodos.",Bruce Almighty

Oddly though, this sense of the divine doesn't limit the use of profanity in the movie very much.  However, despite its crassness, the message in the movie of humility in questioning God's wisdom in the decisions He chooses to make is strong.  There are plenty of humorous moments in the film, although it falls a bit short of being hilarious.  I recommend the movie, but not without reservation.  Don't take small children to see the movie, but its worth viewing once.",Bruce Almighty

It has a few funnies as shown in the trailers, but for the most it is just another offensive attempt of spreading faith based moral and all the associated religious bulls***.

It was used once in a scene in which Bruce calls a group of hoodlums ""f***ers"" loud and clear. It was unmistakable and gratuitous.  Any other word could have been used and would have been just as funny.  There was multiple use of the ""s"" word and ""a"" word.  Although the movie doesn't really promote religion or the lack thereof, it does offer some good messages about God and people's relationship with Him.

I first saw this on TV, then later I bought the DVD and kept watching.Sometimes we really think about why god do some things to us, or why he let things happen to us. In the movie, you'll see almost the same question being lived by a character, 'til god offers him to have his powers and he sees that is not that easy.His live turns upside-down and he finally understand god's way to manage the life, when he lose his wife and all.10 of 10, perfect movie.

As a MASSIVE fan of Jim Carrey, it was a must see for me. I think that Bruce is a typical character for him, and you can usually always tell if he will suit the part before the film has even begun it's production! I particularly enjoyed the scene on the 'Maid of the Mist', where he doesn't even have to open his mouth and causes a lot of hilarity, the other people in the cinema were roaring at this stage. The best scene, in my opinion, was when Bruce causes Evan Baxter (Steven Carell) to go completely mental at the news desk, fantastic work from both the actors, as both of them had to work hard to look like Bruce was causing Evan to do the crazy things. I love it when Carrey does that kind of stupid thing, a little like Liar Liar. He is a credit to the world of entertainment, and I look forward to his future films. I especially look forward to 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' in 2005, having found out about the story line, it is another typical Carrey character.",Bruce Almighty

The beginning was so bland that I could scarcely believe that this was a Jim Carrey movie. My hopes briefly rose during the only memorable part, when Bruce's (Jim's) life/career really comes unglued on the Niagera Falls boat. Hope quickly turned to despair again as the movie plodded on. Kind of reminded my of Mr. Destiny redone with a ""Better say your prayers message"" painfully drummed into your head.

Jim Carrey with God-like powers, and the best he can do is make a monkey come out of a dude's ass?  Give me a break.  There were no jokes to speak of, unless you think giving a man a speech impediment or creating natural disasters to report on are funny.  Even the cookie and milk scene felt tacked on, a last, desperate attempt to make at least one audience member chuckle.  It failed, miserably. Ha ha, you danced to a cheesy 80's tune that smacked of failed irony and blew up a fire hydrant, what a larf!! Oh, sorry, I meant Barf. I know Carrey is a funny guy, but this piece of crap should have been bagged long before it went to film.",Bruce Almighty
465,cathyvoscu,Ingenious,9,12 March 2012,"Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)",Bruce Almighty

As well as having a really funny side, it also has serious side in some parts, and moving parts ( for me anyway) in other parts. everyone did a FAB job in the film, and Jim Carey did himself proud! I'm not used to seeing him doing a 'serious' film, but the parts he did in this film were excellent! i would say the best bit in the film is when Evan is live on air and Bruce does 'mind control' if you like to make him say what he wants him to, i creased up so much when i first watched it! the most moving bit for me was when Bruce got run over by the lorry and his in hospital and grace goes to see him, and they make up blah blah. i found that really moving.",Bruce Almighty

Here he is being funny and yet getting across some good points about how we bug God for everything instead of taking care of business ourselves. I bought this DVD from home cinema movies.com where they seem to have just about everything. Jim Carrey is becoming one of our finest actors and proves it more with each movie. In this one he delivers a performance laced with comedy but also shows a serious side rarely seen in previous movies. He screen presence outshines everyone except of course Morgan Freeman who is in a class by himself. This is also the type of movie you could watch over and over down the road and not be bored. I would rate this movie 8 stars.,Bruce Almighty

Even in ""Hard Rain"", he was a criminal, but one with character. I really liked that. I've enjoyed every role he has played. His performance made the entire movie enjoyable. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. I don't think it's possible for an actor to play such good parts without those parts truly being some part of his character. Believing that, I also believe you must be a wonderful person to know.

The only exception was Steve Carell's delivery of the nonsense that bruce made him spew (as if you couldn't see that coming). I got the feeling that this movie was made in a bad movie factory. Just press the button and out comes the movie- Bzzzt! shallow hal. Bzzzt! bruce almighty. Bzzzt! bad santa Bzzzt! speed. Bzzt anything with vin diesel. And so on and so on, it's a busy factory. Last year I remember around Emmy time people were wondering why the academy never takes comedies seriously (on behalf of Lost in Translation). I think this might be your answer; it's the crap they can just shovel out. Just come up with a semi or totally unoriginal plot and a few predictable jokes and there you have it *poof* a movie.

472,bobbyfishlegs-1,moronic,1,16 March 2005,"Quite possibly the worst movie ever with a man in it. Everything about this film, from the lazy, unimaginative script to the perfunctory performances, lead one to the inevitable conclusion that everyone involved in the making of it should be locked up and shouted at.It's a movie with a message (ah how sweet) and that message seems to be something to do with not complaining about your lot in life, but just accepting that maybe failure, poverty, sickness or whatever stands between you and a better life is simply what 'god', in his infinite wisdom, has in mind for you. For example, as Carrey's life falls apart, Anniston comforts him with a nauseating, ""Gee Bruce, you know everything happens for a reason"". Infant mortality, car crashes,unwanted teenage pregnancy, war and race prejudice don't happen for a reason, at least not a satisfactory one, and neither, it seems, did the making of this movie. But apart from that I really enjoyed it.",Bruce Almighty
473,magneto_noel,indeed...a superb movie..,8,11 May 2005,"after seeing the trailer of the movie in the theater it just made up my mind to go see the movie.when it came i and my buddies decided to go and i can tell you that such a hilarious,dramatical and sentimental movie you must not have seen.there is so many incident in the movie which is or was a part in my life.the director must have taken pains to create such kinda films and i am sure he'll be awarded from the audience in the future. another funny thing is that a Hindi movie is also set to release based on the same apical concept. but due to some technical problems they couldn't shoot the movie.i wish the director would have some plans to shoot the sequel of the movie but with a different taste,like if he included some action scenes.",Bruce Almighty
474,lei0004,Unique and fun,8,20 April 2015,"What would happen if a normal person got given god-like powers? That's the question this movie revolves around as Bruce, a down on his luck news reporter finds himself with said powers after he blames his misfortune on God. As Bruce comes to terms with his powers, he does what everyone would do- improve their life massively. Hilarity ensues, with monkeys coming out of butts, traffic clearing instantly, etc. Along with all the gags scattered throughout the film, it also gives a good insight into what would occur if someone came across such power, making you question if it really is such a good thing. This is clearly Jim Carrey at his finest- he expertly slips into the role of Bruce as if he was born for this role. The cast is great and the writing is greater- this movie is definitely worth viewing just to see Jim's character become overwhelmed with power. 8/10",Bruce Almighty
475,magicboy99,Even Jim Carrey couldn't save this.,6,5 January 2015,"First off, let me just say I am a huge fan of Jim Carrey. I loved him in Ace Ventura and The Truman Show. So when this got put on Netflix this past New Year's I couldn't grab my iPad fast enough. But let me tell you I finished the movie with a sense of confusion, but not like the confusion you get if you watch a Christopher Nolan movie. This was more of a, ""so, what did I just watch?"" The plot was all over the place, I couldn't figure out if this was a story about Bruce's claim to fame as a news anchor or a love story between Grace and Bruce or Bruce's struggles with his religion. The writing was cheesy in some spots and really took away from Carrey's performance. Also, the movie got really preachy towards the climax when God tells Bruce that the true miracles were in our control and being able to do the supernatural like levitate or read minds were just magic tricks. I really did not appreciate having a lesson shoved in my face during a comedy. Oh, and what was with the homeless man holding up random signs? It really took away from the story and made it hard to catch back up. The comedy was had its moments when Carrey did what he does best and I cannot emphasize enough how great the cast was. So if you're looking for a cinematic jewel, I would look somewhere else (like Good Will Hunting, the best movie of all time and is also on Netflix), but you will enjoy this as a family or friends movie or if you just have no other movies to watch.",Bruce Almighty

477,GabBrousset,Best,7,30 September 2015,"Bruce Almighty is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac, written by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk and stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck TV reporter who complains to God (Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly, and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week. This is Shadyac and Carrey's third collaboration after working together on Shadyac's first film, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, in 1994 and Liar Liar in 1997.When released in American theaters in May 2003, it took the #1 spot at the box office, grossing $85.89 million—higher than the release of Pearl Harbor, making it the second-highest-rated Memorial Day weekend opening of any film in motion picture history (until the release of X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006).[3] The movie surprised media analysts when it beat The Matrix Reloaded after its first week of release. By the time it left theaters in December 2003, it took in a United States domestic total of over $242 million and $484 million worldwide.",Bruce Almighty
478,ottar_imdb,Much too sweet,1,19 August 2005,"Everything is so sweet and correct that the movie is best suited for small children. You can safely watch this film together with a priest.Carry's face is as usual on film. He is a clown with a limited repertoire, not a actor.The concept / idea could have worked if not everything was so predictable and if Carry could stop making funny faces.Aniston plays the same role as in Friends. She is the ""beautiful"" American girl, with a good heart and maybe not to bright.I've seen some of Carry's other movies and this one is definitely the one I like the least.",Bruce Almighty
479,g00dbye_k1tty,See It!,8,13 December 2005,"See It! I recommend you see Bruce Almighty because it is a very funny film and because it is detail oriented. In addition, the story contains many thought provoking scenes.I watched Bruce Almighty at my house, and I knew that it was a romantic comedy. Also being aware that it starred Jim Carrey, I was a little prepared for the strange thematic tones of the film. It also stars Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston who both add a refreshing realism to the film with their excellent acting.I recommend you see Bruce Almighty because it is a very comical film. This is a fairly obvious assumption, noting the star. But the humor does play a huge role, taking into account some of the more serious issues that are brought up in this film. These issues are evident from the very start; one of the first lines is newscaster Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) blatantly asking while being filmed for the news, ""God, why do you hate me?"" A possibly controversial and definite strong statement for an opening line and without Carrey's candor and goofy smiles this line never would have worked. Another example of the role humor plays in this film is during a scene when Grace Connolly (Jennifer Anniston), Bruce's girlfriend, urges Bruce to donate blood during her workplace's blood drive. Grace gives blood but Bruce refuses, stating, ""All that stuff just ends up in warehouse somewhere, anyway."" Later on in the film when Bruce finds himself in a hospital and owing his life to the blood transfusion he has received, Grace walks in and says softly, ""I hear all that stuff just ends up in a warehouse somewhere"", with a camera shot highlighting the blood Bruce is receiving, ""O negative"", Grace's blood type. These examples show the necessity of having the right cast to match up with each character. Bruce Almighty encompasses many genres and also demonstrates the diversity one film can display, including being funny as well as portraying a serious message. Jim Carrey's humor, along with that of other actors, takes this film up a notch from films that strive for solely a message or comedy.I also recommend you see this film because it displays an amazing attention to detail. There is a certain homeless man that silently narrates the story for the audience, and his image is slipped in before every main event in the plot. In the beginning of the story this man, with the sign, ""R Ewe Blind?"" is saved from a group of thugs by Bruce Nolan, pre-God powers. In a scene directly before we witness the destruction caused by Bruce's selfish use of power, the man holds a sign, ""Thy Kingdumb come"". This sign communicates the extent to which Bruce has abused his supremacy and allows the audience to realize the damage it has caused. The attention to detail and theme is also demonstrated by the closing shot, of the homeless man with sign ""Armageddon Outta Here"". An intriguing twist thoroughly in keeping with the theme of this movie ties up the homeless man subplot in this scene, and also explains the actions of key characters. These continuities and details are what takes the film to a higher level and make it very much worth seeing.In addition, the story line is thought provoking. While it is in no ways subtle, the plot still manages to engage the audience intellectually. What is really going on here? What are all of these scenes supposed to communicate to me? These were a couple of the questions I continually asked myself while viewing, and throughout the film I came up with answers. A film that engages the audience in this way is the kind of film that I enjoy, and I believe many others enjoy films that have this connection of certain actions to precise meanings with an overall theme as the result, as well.With a decisive message communicated through a series of singularly insignificant events and humorous scenes, Bruce Almighty is a film worth seeing and analyzing.",Bruce Almighty
480,yanoshevitz,Bruce Almighty - God's creation!,10,17 February 2017,"The movie makes you think that god really does exists and his name is Morgan Freeman! It is One of the best movies i have ever seen. A movie with actors such as Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Has to be a winning Title. If you haven't watched it yet - Just do it!

481,bigdas1,Jim Almighty,7,3 December 2005,"Yes, agreed, Jen is pretty but that's about it. Nuff said. As for Jim Carry, this movie is a good vehicle for his brand of humor, which is from the old Jerry Lewis school of cinematic chicanery, but not quite as annoying. At least, he knows how to present it. God help us if he ever decides to direct his own film. As for the movie itself, it bears the usual Carry theme (ala Jerry Lewis) of a born loser finding retribution from the supernatural (refer to The Mask), and he does it well, which seems to be his only stock and store. His outtakes probably outnumber his intakes, and perhaps he can splice them together to make featurette, don't rush to the video stores soon. Supported by the talents of veteran actor Morgan Freeman, the hotness of Catherine Bell and the cuteness of Jennifer Anniston, he manages to pull off a barely passable parcel of fun shlock which shall live in the suitcases of that guy selling rips in the subway terminal station. Thanks, Jim, you've done it again.",Bruce Almighty

My sister and I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time, and being huge Jim Carrey fans we had tried to find all the information possible that had any link to the film. I felt that this movie was one of his best yet, it has everything, romance, some fantasy and hilarious comedy that had both my sister and I laughing throughout the film. This film is definitely one of Jim's best and as well as being hilariously funny it has a deep meaning to it and has quite a powerful moral which makes it entertaining and a good movie for young and old. Overall a must see movie for everyone!",Bruce Almighty

It would rate at least a ""7"" if this were done.",Bruce Almighty
