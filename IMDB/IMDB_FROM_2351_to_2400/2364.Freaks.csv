0,SnoopyStyle,intriguing origin story,7,24 December 2019,"A man (Emile Hirsch) keeps his daughter Chloe locked up in their home. He insists that the outside world is dangerous and has even covered the windows. Her mom (Amanda Crew) is supposedly long gone. Ice cream man Mr. Snowcone (Bruce Dern) and little girl Harper Reed try to lure her outside. Her curiosity gets the better of her and she sneaks out of the house.Since Chronicle, there has been many sci-fi indies trying to deconstruct the superhero origin story. There are a couple of questionable choices but overall, it is a well told story. The movie could start with better misdirection. I keep going back to Harper's ice cream cone. Harper should be afraid and angry like she is later in the movie. I don't understand why the ice cream is dripping. Some of the powers may not make sense. The movie needs more action for the third act. In the end, this is an intriguing origin story.",Freaks
1,claudio_carvalho,Intriguing and Suspenseful Film,6,22 March 2020,"""Freaks"" is an intriguing and suspenseful low-budget film that keeps the viewer in tension until the very end. It is difficult to write a synopsis without spoiler. The cast has great performance and the screenplay is well written, but the conclusion is disappointing. The gorgeous Lexy Kolker is a promising actress and viewers should follow her future works to confirm her future in the cinema industry. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Freaks
2,nogodnomasters,Tell me you love me,8,5 January 2020,"PLOT SPOILER.Chloe lives with her father in a secluded house that is very suspicious to begin with. He tells his daughter not to go outside that there are bad people out to kill her. There is a man outside (Bruce Dern and not Clint Howard) who drives an ice cream truck. As it turns out Chloe is actually the freak ""X-Man"" type person in hiding as they are being hunted down and exterminated.Not much of a spoiler as you can figure that much out from the blurb.

And why would your own father ... well the story is quite complex, especially if you haven't read anything about it before you watch the movie.Which is a nice way to enjoy it, since this has a few surprises ahead. For a low budget movie, the effects are quite nice. And the story is more than interesting and holds the tension throughout. Some things may be easy to spot and predict, but it's still quite original and very entertaining.",Freaks

5,paul_haakonsen,"This was, uhm well, downright boring and uneventful...",2,30 November 2019,"I didn't know anything about the 2018 movie ""Freaks"" from writers and directos Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein prior to sitting down to watch it. In fact, I didn't even know about the movie's existence before stumbling upon it by sheer random luck.Now, normally I am not overly keen on sci-fi movies, but I must admit that the movie's cover lured me into sitting down to watch it. It could just happen that this was a gem in the sci-fi genre and I was missing out on something grand.Turns out that I wasn't missing out on anything except for the last 45 minutes or so of the movie. I managed to endure 1 hour of torment of sitting through ""Freaks"". I was tempted two times well before hitting the 1 hour marker to give up and turn it off, but I had resilience and stuck with it. Then as the movie didn't get better and just continued on trotting ahead in a monotonous and uneventful pace, I just gave up.Two things were working in favor of ""Freaks"", and that was the production level and quality of the movie, and the fact that Bruce Dern starred in it. Sadly neither of these two things were sufficient to salvage the movie from the boring wreck it turned out to be.I have no idea what the purpose or point of this movie was. Nor can I really claim to care, because the storyline was abysmal and downright boring. And the characters had all the appeal of wet cardboard.One question comes to mind; how did this movie score well over 5 stars?This was a massive swing and a miss of a movie. I have zero interest in returning to watch the remaining 45 minutes of the movie. I mean, why would I want to throw any more time down that drain? My rating of ""Freaks"" is a more than generous two out of ten stars.",Freaks
6,Calicodreamin,"Interesting concept, annoying main character",5,16 March 2020,"I really enjoyed the concept behind this movie and felt it was very well executed in what was obviously a low budget film.

7,view_and_review,Easily Rivals Marvel,8,8 March 2020,"""Freaks"" is a little bit ""Firestarter"" and a lot bit ""X-Men."" In fact, it is very similar to the X-Men and the Marvel ""Civil War"" story arc (the comic, not the movie).The X-Men comic is about mutants who are generally shunned and disdained by society. ""Freaks"" has a similar scenario. In Marvel ""Civil War"" a few young and inexperienced superpowered teens were chasing down some supervillains, Nitro being one of them. Nitro, in response, detonated himself and blew up six city blocks in Samford, Connecticut. That caused widespread fear of the superpowered and the creation of the superhuman registration act.It seems from the movie ""Freaks"" that at some point a ""freak"" or ""abnormal"" destroyed all of Dallas. That's enough to scare anybody. The ""freaks"" were then summarily killed or locked up in a super secure facility. The ""freaks"" are known by their eyes bleeding (hence the ""Firestarter"" comparison).Chloe (Lexy Kolker) and her father (Emile Hirsch) are ""freaks"" and they are in hiding. The dad keeps drilling his daughter to get her to practice being normal. If she can pass as normal then she has a chance at survival. Unfortunately, Chloe is seven-years-old and seven-year-olds aren't good at keeping up a facade. Not only that, Chloe seems to have a temper. A temper on a powerful seven-year-old is a scary thing.""Freaks"" was slow at times and a bit misleading. Maybe misleading is not the right word--I'll say that it had me guessing and wondering. As the movie progressed the picture became clearer and it was a wonderful picture. The performances were on point, the action was just the right dosage, and the visual effects worked just right. I think this is a movie that Marvel would be proud to have in its arsenal if they could.",Freaks
8,Wizard-8,"Watchable, though has many plot holes",6,21 March 2020,"I will say this about ""Freaks"" - it's one of the more watchable and entertaining Canadian films I have seen, probably because it had some American involvement that prevented it from being somber, dry, and boring like most Canadian films. It has an interesting story with colorful characters, and good production values despite the limited budget. I certainly don't regret watching the movie, and I am giving it a recommendation. However, I should say that my recommendation is a marginal one. One big flaw of the movie is that this particular world is not fully defined and explained. While I did appreciate that the world was not spoon fed to me, at the end I was at a loss as to several aspects concerning how this world came to be. Another big flaw is that there are some glaring plot holes. Whether this was because of key explanation being edited out before the final cut was completed and/or inadequate writing, I cannot say for sure. But as the movie was progressing, I thought a number of times, ""If so and so can do this, why isn't he/she doing it now to get out of the situation?"" I kept seeing that the various crises would have been solved quickly had the central characters simply done the most logical thing. Also, some of the characters' connections and relationships to others were not made clear. I should make clear that ""Freaks"" is still worth seeing despite the murky plot and characters, but you should all the same be prepared for some real gaps when you sit down to watch it.",Freaks
9,deloudelouvain,More stories like this one please.,8,14 January 2020,"I'm glad I didn't read anything about the story before watching Freaks, so it was all a big guessing what the hell was going on. You can't deny there is a lot of mystery in this story and that made it more than entertaining. There are no tons of action scenes, but the few ones are spectacular. The movie has it more from the suspense building and the intriguing story. The acting was really good, especially from Lexy Kolker, what a great performance for a nine-year old, she has definitely a future in the movie business. Her interaction with Emile Hirsch, who was also excellent in his father role, made Freaks stand out in this genre, it's slightly better than a good sci-fi movie. I wouldn't be surprised if one day they made a sequel, I would definitely watch it.",Freaks
10,thesar-2,Get Your Freak On,7,17 May 2020,"Not even close to being a remake. Doesn't even look like they had the budget to recreate the 1932 American Horror Story inspiration.If I liked the main character little girl a fraction of what I was supposed to and they didn't spend 90% of the film having us catch up on their fantastic world-building, I'd love this movie way more. That said, I bet I could lighten up on those two complaints of mine in a second viewing. And I'm not opposed at all to seeing this again.But, yeah, for now, I really didn't like to girl. Totally great acting. I absolutely saw a girl of her age on screen - completely believable. I just didn't like the character at all. Couldn't stand her and that's too bad. She's pretty much the glue in this exciting sci-fi action/horror.If you like Black Mirror/Twilight Zone/10 Cloverfield Lane-type stories, I'd totally recommend this Freaky tale of a Father protecting his daughter from the outside world when all she really wants is: chocolate ice cream. Personally, I prefer Cherry Ice Cream, but I guess, to each their own...Freak.Yeah, I'd watch these Freaks again and any sequel they throw at us.",Freaks

14,ops-52535,i think i got it,6,29 November 2019,"But i'm not sure, because this was a kind of weird little flick to put rather far away back in my cerebral ganglions, because youre all the time hit in the face with a story that is not very well told at all, and what we shall be frightened by is never really defined.its a story about a charming stubborn and eager little girl, and her overprotective and paranoid father, who for all it takes and costs tries to keep the world from coming inside, and his daughter shaded away from the world.the keyword to this film is supernaturality. because apart from the forementioned charm, this little girl posseses physical abilities that every science tutor/teacher wouldve given an arm and a leg for to posses. but this is also what makes this film stressful to follow, and through several occasions where the girl hallusinates, there are also a socalled mum appearing. if shes dead or alive is hard to say, but shes in real dire straits, with something or by someone....one thing is for sure, theyve spent some money on this project, thats reflected through wide use of visual effects, and theyve done a great job on the filmography. the childacting are splendid and so are bruce dern too, which i hope will get some sane caracters to act in forthcoming productions.the grumpy old man cant tell who ''won'' or who were '' defeated'' in the film, because i didnt get it. but i guess you all do, so take a look. its a survivable flick to watch.",Freaks

16,paulclaassen,Wow...!,7,9 December 2019,"'Freaks' is unlike any film of this genre you'll find out there at the moment. The film contains elements of 'Jumper, 'Room', and '10 Cloverfield Lane', yet it is unlike any of these films, and definitely not trying to be like anything we've seen before.'Freaks' captured my attention from the very beginning - for being so different, and so mysterious. Well past the halfway mark it is still not clear what is actually going on, and this is what makes 'Freaks' so different and captivating. It grabs a hold of you to the point where you can hardly contain your curiosity any longer.Lexy Kolker is excellent as 7-year old Chloe. My goodness, this girl can act!! She completely sold her character to me. She is sensational! For a sci-fi movie, there's not really much in the line of CGI - or obvious CGI for that matter - and that's a bonus. The subtle effects throughout the film are effective and stunning. 'Freaks' is a freakishly weird and brilliant movie that you'd want to watch again and again. Wow, this was incredible.",Freaks
17,eddie_baggins,An above average independent offering,6,24 February 2020,"A tricky film to talk about, due to the fact many of the great moments within it come from not knowing what is coming or where you are heading, independent sleeper hit Freaks is a solid attempt by directing duo Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein at crafting a unique offering that should be applauded for doing a lot with nothing more than an idea and some solid actors to bring it to life.Advancing from various TV works and director for hire roles, Lipovsky and Stein mess with a somewhat familiar yet refreshingly unpredictable sci-fi/thriller landscape, as they thrust viewers into the mind and world of Lexy Kolker's young girl Chloe, whose home imprisonment at the behest of her father (played by an as good as his been in years Emile Hirsch) is either a needful move by her protective father in a world he says is too dangerous for her to enter or the move of a madman whose bonkers view on the state of the planet is disallowing Chloe a chance of a normal life.Who is right, what is happening and where the film is going is all brilliantly set-up in a tension riddled and well-played out first act that gives both Kolker and Hirsch a chance to really gel together in what's an impressive double header and while the likes of Bruce Dern, Grace Park and Amanda Crew all have various roles to play in Freaks story, this is at heart a story about a father and daughter in an extra ordinary situation that's at its best when the films main stars are allowed too hog the limelight.Sadly for Freaks, as the film begins to morph into something else entirely and its genres begin to expand with it, Lipovsky and Stein lose sight of the more confined and well-rounded set-up that grips us tightly at first instance, as its increasingly far-fetched and over-reaching narrative starts to take over and become more of a generic offering than what we first expected of it to become.It's unfortunate that Freaks best work is found in its first half, had the film been able to sustain its energy, character building and mystery that is to be easily found in its first half, the film would've become a very worthy break out hit.As it stands, the moments of brilliance that are scattered throughout this duel directing effort suggest an exciting career ahead for two filmmakers who have showcased here, with very little fanfare or budget, that their imaginations and directional nuance could well deliver a genuinely special feature event in the future, while Sci-Fi acolytes in particular are sure to enjoy the delights that Freaks has in store for them across a largely unpredictable ride.Final Say -A small film with big ideas, not everything in Freaks works but there's enough here (particularly in a strong first half) to suggest this likely future cult favourite will find its fair share of ardent fans.3 chocolate ice-creams out of 5",Freaks
18,digitalbeachbum,"Great idea, but poorly executed",2,27 March 2020,"This is a story about freaks who have super powers. Another cookie cutter, lack of attention to detail movie about people with superpowers hiding from the public.The movie is interesting in the beginning. I thought it was holding its own. However, it quickly went downhill after more characters were being introduced.First, being able to control space and time is a difficult power to relay in a script. Time travel always a story killer if it is done wrong, but also the slowing down of time or other forms of manipulation have to be perfected before they make the story turn into a cartoon.Second, super flight doesn't make you invulnerable to damage or the elements. It is sort of like The Flash having super speeds. At first it was pointed out that is clothing should burn up when moving so fast, but then they creators gave him special costume to wear, but then it was pointed out how time really works scientifically so they made him a manipulated of time and space, thus making The Flash a cartoon character rather than a human with super powers.Thirdly, having the power to force people to do something that they don't want to do is a great power, but it needs a range limit and it also needs to have a weakness concerning will-power of the subject. There are a few good things with this power but the attention to details was lost thereby nullifying a good character.Lastly, why is it the local cops? Where is the government agents? Why are local cops commanding drones with Hellfire missiles? And how does an old man who can turn invisible know the amount of time it takes for a Hellfire missile to reach its target?Overall I was bored as the story fell apart and became predictable. It is sad, because this could have been a pretty good movie.",Freaks

22,jtindahouse,Mildly intriguing but lacks purpose,6,17 December 2019,"I hate it when potentially good movies ruin themselves by having kids playing their lead roles, and they consequently play it safe in terms of language and violence. I also equally commend any films that don't fall into that trap. 'Freaks' would have been a really bland movie if it didn't have the levels of violence it did, but because it does it becomes a must more watchable film, albeit far from a perfect one.The movie starts out a little like 'Room' with a child being kept inside a house 24/7 for unknown reasons. That's about the only thing those two films have in common though because 'Freaks' divulges into the sci-fi genre from there and never looks back. It's a kind of interesting world, but the whole movie also feels a little hollow. There isn't really a purpose to anything other than survival. One comes up near the end of the movie, but until that point we don't even know about it.It's a risky thing to base your movie around a child lead actor because they can be very annoying to watch. Lexy Kolker does her best, but it has to be said that the movie does lose a lot with not having the charisma an adult could bring to a similar role. 'Freaks' isn't a bad little escape movie, and if they do a sequel I suspect it will be better than this one because it will likely give them more purpose in whatever they're doing than this one did.",Freaks
23,stevendbeard,Paranoid or Over Protective?,7,15 September 2019,"I saw ""Freaks"", starring Emile Hirsch-Lone Survivor, The Girl Next Door; Bruce Dern-The Peanut Butter Falcon, The Hateful Eight; Grace Park-Hawaii Five_O_tv, Battlestar Galactica_tv; Amanda Crew-Charlie St. Cloud, The Haunting in Connecticut and Lexy Kolker-Shooter_tv, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._tv.
This is a sci_fi thriller with some twists. Emile plays a man that has hidden his daughter, Lexy, in their house for 7 years-she is 7 1/2 years old. He tells her that she has to stay hidden because there are people outside that want to kill them, the same people that killed her mother, Amanda. Emile makes runs outside for supplies and tells her not to leave while he is gone or even talk to anyone if they come to the door-when she does, she is punished by being locked in a closet. Sometimes, when she is being punished, Lexy sees Amanda in the closet with her and doesn't know if it's a ghost or what. Is Emile being paranoid or just being a little over protective? Bruce plays an ice cream truck driver that hangs around a lot in front of Emile's house, selling his wares. Grace plays the leader of a group of armed government agents that Emile seems to be afraid of. Like I said, there are lots of twists, but everything is explained by the end.

27,kirbylee70-599-526179,ANTI HEROICS,8,27 January 2020,"With the rise in popularity of the super hero film it was only a matter of time before the negative side effects of super heroes were seen as well. The first film in this genre was BRIGHTBURN and it was an amazing film, a look at Superman had he not been the all American Boyscout that the comics have him to be. Now a second film in the genre arrives, FREAKS, and it has not as harmful a look but one that draws questions as well.Seven year old Chloe (Lexy Kolker) lives in isolation with her father (Emile Hirsch). Their house is boarded up and the windows have newspaper over them, preventing not just anyone from looking in but Chloe from looking out. He warns her not to go anywhere, not to step outside the door and if he thinks she has, she's punished for it. While some might suspect the movie is about a kidnapper the truth is he honestly is her father and wants to protect her. But from what?When dad steps out to take care of items their survival depends on, Chloe begins getting curious. That curiosity is egged on when a book is dropped though the mail slot, a book about an ice cream truck. While reading it she hears the bells of the truck, peeks out and sees it parked in front of her house. Disobeying her father, she steps out and talks to the man in the truck (Bruce Dern). A friendship develops and it isn't long before Chloe begins to wonder if there isn't something wrong with her father.But strange things with Chloe make the viewer wonder just who has the issue. She talks to her friends who suddenly appear in her room, or rather her room transforms into theirs. She also sees her mother somewhere looking haggard, troubled and tied down. Their conversations talk about warnings and being careful, much like her father's do.On one expedition outside dad returns wounded, shot in the side. When he passes out Chloe takes advantage of it and goes for a ride with the ice cream man. They visit and park and he talks to her about pushing herself, releasing her true potential. When a policeman approaches the pair and draws his weapon, Chloe gets upset and screams which causes the officer to holster his gun and walk away. It also causes her eyes to bleed tears, something her father warned her of earlier and that she saw advertised on a sign.So somewhat of a spoiler her now. If you don't want to know any more, then stop. What we discover is a world in which mutants have been born, called freaks, who have different powers. When one such person had an accident killing a number of people, it was decided to round up these powered folks and provide them with a location all their own to live in. Or so it seemed.With each passing moment we learn more about these people and how Chloe, father, mother and the ice cream man all have ties to them. We also learn why Chloe is so special and how she will be the turning point for all the ""freaks"" from here on forward.Super hero film? Of course. This provides a take on the mutants of comics, a mild riff on the X-men without actually calling it that or saying the phrase mutant powers. But that is indeed what we are watching here. A world where those who are different are captured and locked up by a world fearful of them. They have every right to be afraid but had they chosen a different path then what.The movie unravels a bit at a time, never revealing too much and allowing the actions on screen to tell the tale. The performances are superb here, especially young Kolker on whose shoulders the film rests. Had she not been able to pull off a believable performance the movie would have bombed. Instead it soars with her performance alongside those of her co-stars.The movie was not released in a way that garnered it much attention but now that it's on disc it makes up for that mistake. Now the film can be discovered by a public that will appreciate the film. And while there are other more major releases appearing my suggestion would be that this be the film you give a watch this week.",Freaks
28,kluseba,Intelligent contemporary science-fiction drama,8,24 August 2020,"Freaks is a fresh contemporary American-Canadian science-fiction drama. The story revolves around a seven-year old girl whose mother died in her early childhood and whose paranoid father overprotects her. As she grows older, she starts questioning her father's restrictive rules as she desires to discover the world outside her home to find a new mother figure and make friends. She ultimately escapes from her home and befriends a mysterious ice cream truck driver. As the girl learns about the strange man's real identity, her own past and her dangerous supernatural capacities, things start dangerously spinning out of control.This dynamic movie convinces on numerous levels. The story comes around with a few interesting twists and turns and ends on an intense note. The film impresses with a gloomy atmosphere from start to finish. For a science-fiction movie, Freaks has a surprisingly human vibe that makes the different characters quite attaching. The excellent acting performances increase this connection between the audience and the characters and especially child actress Alexa Kolker does an excellent job and becomes one with her role. The special effects aren't overused and employed very efficiently throughout the film.There are very few things to criticize. The movie's opening third has an at times slow pace to introduce the different characters and settings. Bruce Dern plays the grumpy old man he seems to play in every recent movie these days and it would have been great for him to get a more diversified role.Still, Freaks is a movie that should appeal both to younger audiences due to the excellent lead character and actress and older audiences due to the serious tone and story of the movie. Even cinephiles who usually dislike science-fiction movies should like Freaks if they are looking for a profound drama with a clever story. It's great to see so many intelligent science-fiction films such as A Quiet Place, The Witch and Vivarium being made these days. This genre can be so much more than aliens, battles and space. If you are looking for a creative contemporary science-fiction movie, look no longer and get started right here with Freaks.",Freaks

This is another world where mutants are feared, persecuted and imprisoned. They are referred to as Abnormals. Time bubbles, invisibility, slowing down bullets and missiles are just some of the mutant powers which are displayed. But there are means of suppressing them and the Abnormal Defense Force which hunts them down shoots first despite their claims of wanting to help. The action scenes are well executed and Hirsch, Kolker and Dern (at his demented best) put in good performances. Interesting and worth watching but doesn't really add anything new to the Maltreated Mutants trope. Co-Written and Co-Directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein. 7/10. On Netflix.",Freaks

It's a wizard performance. This is a highly intelligent and well thought out sci-fi thriller. It begins with both a natural (because of the girl's age) and heightened sense of danger. There are three main revelations in this movie, all of which are handled with considerable care. This is movie is so exciting it almost kills me to resist spoilers at this point. Suffice to say each is a gratifying escalation of both intrigue and of looming peril. It's all truly brilliant. I've seen an episode of Legion (2017) and also the movie Midnight Special (2016), to name two examples where you could compare, but the real competition for Freaks is Brightburn (2019).

But they bury it entirely.I went in not knowing anything, I think I got a glimpse of some interesting auto-play. And normally that's a great experience, but not building the world premise until the 2nd act shaves a little bit off. Now, that shouldn't spoil anything, it just explains why I thought I got tricked into watching a kidnapping movie for almost the first half.Once they start opening up and communicating, the movie picks up in the right direction nicely. And the movie is filled with familiar faces: I'm not going to tell you that you'd know their names, but they're all good actors, and a lovely surprise to see Amanda Crew rounding out her acting range in this.I do want to call out Lexy Kolker (the little girl), who attempted to carry the lead role in this movie, it's her movie (despite being listed 5th on IMDB) who did a great job for her age.

I liked the overall idea and in truth, it was well-directed with great acting performances, quite unexpected from such a low budget flick. However what is taking 1 or even 2 stars off for me is the very poorly written script. The characters are extremely unlikeable, especially the little girl; how are we supposed to care what happens to them? And many elements of the story just don't make much sense when you think about them a little too long.

45,abisio,Be ready for 90 minutes of nail biting,10,16 September 2019,"Freaks is not an horror movie even when there are some very terrifying situations. It is a science fiction movie with a mystery, the less you know the better.
But the most important; is basically a great (I assume) independent movie; with an outstanding cast specially the incredible Lexy Kolker who deserves Golden Globe and Oscar (and whatever prize you could imagine). She plays a 7 years old girl; trying to understand her father paranoia (Emile Hirsch never better) ; her mother assassination and some strange characters appearing around (like Bruce Dern ) or inside her home.
Let's just say that after the very dramatic and intriguing first act; things start getting more scarier when the girl is able to get out of her home against her father orders and when we finally understand what happens; tension grows even more up to finale that avoids any politically correctness.A few months ago; Brightburn converted Superman's beginning story to an horror tale; this one uses the X-MEN concept on more realistic and suspenseful way.If Freaks creators would have made X-MEN Dark Phoenix; it should had been a must see; but the message was clear. To made a great movie you need intelligence; not only money.In brief; it is the one of the best movies around. For sure the best about X-people but without the X-MEN and the comics.",Freaks

After that there is nothing left for you to expect of it. You know how it is going to end, everything is super obvious and if you are a sci-fi fan you will get bored pretty fast. And you will still have about an hour of it left.I can forgive the movie for obviously cheap effects and amateur-looking sets. But I can't really enjoy it because it was way too obvious and boring. They spill everything out too early and drop the subtlety. The script also has tons of holes and is mostly driven by our characters doing very stupid things.I'd even prefer a disappointing twist to just the expectation of an obvious ending.
I am still, however, grateful for the effort. It didn't quite work out now, but the directors might do something better and refined in the future. They also managed to put in a couple of cool scenes though.I wanted to rate this lower, but the girl was just too good, I enjoyed her performance, she is very good by child acting standards.

The result being (spoiler alert) about 20 people die in order to save 1 person which just made no sense at all, despite them smiling at the end it certainly didn't feel like a happy ending.

Not exactly 'Hard' Science Fiction in the sense of it being real technical, but serious in the sense of it being in my lowly and wretched opinion, a DAMN good story!I have no bloody idea who this little actress is, but if hopefully she can survive the dangerous rigors of Hollywood, she is going to be a PHENOMENAL actor...

However, as the story unraveled, sadly, it turned out that the questions asked were more interesting than the answers received. The filmmakers had nailed the world-building during the first half, structuring the plot carefully, giving it piece by piece. Themes like childhood curiosity, extreme parenting & dystopian horrors are explored. The lesser flaw is the pacing, it's a slow-burn long before it is action, but it's never really boring. The big flaw, though, is how actually straight forward and routine the story is, hidden carefully behind the aforementioned world-building. Clever choices, but the resolution/s in the story are therefore less surprising and less impactful. Nevertheless, we have an interesting main hero, Chloe, a 7 years old girl whose head we live in throughout the movie. Most of the characters were decent if a little (or more) clichéic & the performances carrying them - great. For one I feel like Bruce Dern literally never fails.

She can't quite carry the whole movie, but she comes mighty close.",Freaks
79,pinkarray,Just all kinds of wtf,3,20 January 2021,"For the 45 minutes or so, I was like, eh... it's okay. There were a lot of questions and interesting things coming up that made me want to watch more. Still I felt confused as to what was going on.So we start off with a 7-year-old girl named Chloe, who wants to go outside and get ice cream but is disallowed by her father, who for some reason wants to keep her locked in and warns her of the dangers of outside. It turns out later, that he's keeping her in hiding due to his family having superpowers that label them as ""freaks"" and are hunted down for it. Nice page turner huh? Well, you're in for disappointment.So, one of my problems start near the beginning of the film. Even though the old man out of nowhere turns out to be her grandfather, it's still creepy to see a young girl riding an ice cream truck with her old man. Like for a man as protective as the dad was, he never taught her stranger danger? Like did she ever get that into her thick skull that he could be a danger or was she too selfish to care?Anyway, when she gets to the park, all of a sudden, she gets scared of the old man and says she wants to go home. Then WHY DID YOU EVEN GET IN THE TRUCK ANYWAY, KID?!?!That night, the movie starts to play tricks on the audience where Chloe meets a ghost who turns out to be the same woman in the picture her grandfather gave her, her mother. Chloe tries to tell her mom that it's her even though she hadn't met her since she was a baby. Her mom still doesn't recognize her yells ""GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE I RIP YOUR THROAT OUT!"" This part led me to think that the mom was crazy too, only to find out that she actually isn't crazy when her daughter comes into her closet the next day and gets her to realize that she IS her actual daughter. So... why was she saying that anyway? Why was she threatening a little girl, saying she wants to rip her throat out? Like that part was just pointless then. She's not a villain, she's a good guy.She also tells her that she needs a new mom. Well, spoiler alert, she turns out to not be a ghost and has been alive all this time so why does she need to tell her that she needs a new mom? Like I really don't even know what is going on in this movie anymore.But don't worry, it gets much much worse. The next morning, the movie starts going into a completely different direction. So before that night, I believe, Chloe starts yelling at her dad, saying that there's no bad people outside and saying she wants to kill him. At first, I thought ""Ah, she's just a little girl. She doesn't actually mean that. Still, my jaw dropped. And then THAT NEXT MORNING! The girl gives her father juice to make up for her argument the other day. When the dad is about to drink it, he realizes that there's poison in it. So he chases after her, trying to attack her but she stands out the front door, yelling ""Go to sleep"" multiple times until her dad passes out.And no, these aren't the only awful things she does, oh no. The things that she does to her father? She does to EVERY SINGLE PERSON who doesn't give her what she wants. She mentally (and when I say mentally, I mean MENTALLY) attacks her neighbors, her dad and her grandfather to do what she wants them to do. She crashes another little girl's slumber party. She almost killed her dad by giving him a cup of poison juice. She manipulates her young neighbor's mom to act like a mother to her and this is where she becomes so unbearable to watch. She's the epitome of a selfish brat but over-exaggerated in movie form to be more creepy and powerful. Yeah yeah you want a mom and you want to go outside but why are you trying to kill your parents and show off your powers to people who are AFRAID of you and want you DEAD?!After these scenes, I stopped watching the movie. There is too much needless melodrama and an unbearable child character for me to go on. I felt with some more drafting, cutting scenes out, and more focus on trying to become ""normal"" while being a freak plot, it would be a more enjoyable film. Like I would've loved to known if there were other freaks besides this family.What is there to say about this movie? It's just an awful mess. First minute it's a thriller/horror movie about a group called ""Freaks"" being hunted down and then the next, becomes a cliche family drama where a girl wants a new mom. I advise you not to watch it. Don't let the interesting storyline fool you, it's a terribly executed movie. I mean, if you're the type of person who will eat up any superhero, thought-provoking, and mystery stories then by all means, go watch it. It might be a good time-waster for you. Just be warned there is convoluted plotting and an annoying child character in there who btw is played amazingly by Lexy Kolker as well as the other actors.",Freaks
80,scb_coldsteel,An interesting and Innovative look at the mutant mythos,8,19 September 2019,"So I saw the movie Freaks at Central Cinema. This was another blind watch on my part. I went into the movie knowing absolutely nothing about the film's content. That being said I walked away quite pleased. While not a perfect film, Freaks is certainly an ambitious and interesting look at the oversaturated superhero genre that's worth seeing.The premise of Freaks reads like classic Chris Claremont era X-Men. A super powered man and his daughter lock themselves away from a world that both fears and hates them. While the father fights to keep his daughter's identity protected, she simply wants to live an ordinary life and have a family. From there the film evolves into a slow burn science fiction film that takes an interesting look at the superhero mythos, while also acting as a coming-of-age family drama.While Freaks doesn't exactly have the most original premise, the manner in which the story is told really captured the imagination. In a genre packed with big budget special effects and over the top action Freaks is populated with dialogue-driven character interactions. This isn't a story simply about powers as much as it was about blind hysteria and discrimination against certain groups. It's exactly why I love Classic X-Men stories and Freaks really does a great job utilizing the idea.The film was also a refreshing veer away from the formulaic superhero genre in that the main cast was populated with realistic characters believably interacting with each other. All the main characters felt very real and human and not simply cartoon caricatures. The entire film was a very emotional and character-driven ride overall. It was a very nice change of pace compared to the traditional over the top action popcorn flick look at the genre.Despite the minimal budget I was impressed with the way the film was shot and directed. The director made use of the characters powers without appearing flashy while still demonstrating the range of the characters powers. The film really made dialogue above powers and that certainly helped with some budgeting choices. The film also kept the locations to a minimal, but managed to incorporate that into the story quite well with its screenwriting choices. Overall a very well made film with a minimal budget.Acting-wise the performances ranged from mediocre to good with the two standouts being Lexy Kolker and Emile Hirsch playing the daughter and father duo. Hirsch just perfectly played the paranoid yet protecting father and provided some of the film's most memorable moments. I'm not familiar with Kolker, but she is certainly someone to keep an eye on. Bruce Dern also poped up and I simply love him in everything at this point.As much as I liked Freaks it was still far from perfect. While the presentation may have been different, the premise was certainly unoriginal. At times it almost felt like a really well-made fan film on the X-men lore. I did enjoy the leads of the film, but unfortunately the rest of the film was populated by cardboard characters with very little redeeming qualities. The film can also be quite heavy-handed in pushing its underlying concept regarding discrimination at the expense of the film itself. There were also a number of world building ideas introduced that really never got answered.That being said the pluses certainly outweighs the minuses here. While the premise and world may have been unoriginal, the film still managed to tell an interesting and relatable story that I had a blast watching. Freaks is all around a great example that you don't need a massive budget and CGI through the roof to take on the superhero genre. A 7.5 out 10.",Freaks

And required greater effort to develop the script,Freaks
83,js-66130,SCI-FINE,8,16 September 2019,"Taking on a well worn mutant story line that's been part of the mighty Marvel universe from day one, where the line between good and bad is hazy grey, ""Freaks"" is less about showy CGI but more about familial relations. And that's why it works. The daughter, mother, father and grandpa family tree that forms the film is a messy tangle of branches and unwieldy roots, which slowly align as the plot unfolds.Lexy Kolker as single digit aged Chloe, brings a charming naiveté of someone new to life, who might have access to a mysterious super power. The movie rests on her tiny shoulders, and she pulls it off. Whether dealing with her sketchy dad (Emile Hirsch) who may or may not be crazy, or her ghostly mom (Amanda Crew) who may or may not be real, or her sketchy grandpa (Bruce Dern) who may or may not be the neighbourhood ice cream man, Chloe is the central magnet and is damn easy to root for.Adding another late career feather in his well worn acting hat, Dern is devilicious in his rambunctious retiree role, offering equal doses of creepiness and blood line dedication. Chloe's confusing and changing allegiances to her dad and grandpa is a clever device that spices up this top notch thriller.My biggest problem with Emile Hirsch is that he looks and acts like Jack Black. It's distracting. But that's a personal qualm, and one that shouldn't detract from the performance, which is manic good.Yes the story gets a little wacky, after all we are talking about an apocalyptic mutant scenario, so wacky is par for the course. There's enough heart, relatability, and thankfully a lack of superhero posturing (no silly costumes!) to make ""Freaks"" a winner.Yup.",Freaks

This is more like a horror sci fi due to all the message and subtle details and plot that very slowly opens up and you are getting more and more information as to who/why and what.
I was skeptical at first, but in 10 minutes it got sucked into the plot which didn't let go.
See my other reviews to see what I like. I feel like some reviewers have to tell the whole story with their nonsense long reviews or give long trailers which you can already see.
If you like Sci-Fi, this is it! This is not a B-rated low budget flick with bad acting. This is one of the best movies out there and in my top 25 movies of 2018.",Freaks

88,asage19,"Disturbing, fresh antidote to films like X-Men",10,17 May 2020,"I love the X-Men films and have watched all of them. This film is rated as sci-fi/mystery, and it is those, but I think it is also horror. The story and the perspective are quite disturbing, and kind of the flip side of the organized, genial presentation of 'abilities' in the X-Men movies. There is no kind, avuncular man in an academy for 'gifted' young people defending and educating both the students and the public, in this film.
This take on it really had me asking questions about whether I would be troubled by people who have abilities, if I were one who did not. There really are no good guys and bad guys. The people with abilities are persecuted, to be sure, but they are ordinary people, with the emotions and mindsets of ordinary people, caught in their particular situation. They aren't superheroes, and they aren't heroes.
The 'issue' is not presented in black and white. For a short film, it covers a lot of territory, sometimes in brief, informative strokes, like the destruction of Dallas. Also, the film focuses on the child and her abilities, and her use of her abilities. The film has presented a kind of horror film. Where I might ordinarily feel sympathy, I feel dread and fear, at such abilities being used, unbridled, by someone who is not old enough to really understand the world, and life, or to have very much control - she's a child, she's emotional, *she* sees the world in black and white and in terms of *what she wants* and behaves accordingly. The adults in the film are pretty much all focused on protecting her, or using her, or allowing her to direct their movements. It kind of reminds me of the questions raised by the episode of Twilight Zone called ""It's A Good Life"".
There is a 'happy ending' (but at such a cost!), yet I can't feel that it's something to cheer about. It's an interesting, disturbing film. I tip my hat to the directors and cast.",Freaks
89,plasticanimalz,Okay for an Indie,6,28 January 2020,"Maybe if I hadn't already seen Brightburn, which is a similar theme, or Bird Box, which this also reminded me of, maybe I would have liked it better? I'm not sure. For an indie it's decent, but, it could have been stronger. This is clearly very low budget, so, I realize they don't have as much they can work with, but, overall, this kept my attention but I wouldn't say I was necessarily rewarded for that. I just thought it was going to be better.It had been on the iTunes top rentals for a while, but the trailer while somewhat intriguing, just seemed not good. Based on discovering Amanda Crew was in it, and one friend saying it was good I decided to watch it. It was fine. Not bad, and good is a bit of a stretch. Okay is the best summation. Emile Hirsch being weird for the first hour of the film before it starts to ramp up is not enough, or the mystery of what the young girl keeps seeing. There needed to be more. The mystery before the payoff of what is going on, was just dragged on for too long. So, when you do get the payoff, it's not that great. A lot of build, draaaaged out, not enough payoff delivered. Cloverfield Lane, yet another film very similar, with very few sets, that worked. In fact, the majority of Cloverfield Lane had only 3 people and a handful of sets is 98% of the film. So, they did a lot more with less.Freaks is basically a business card for the actors and directors to show they can do something at least passable, in hopes of getting better work. Most indies these days are basically bad, mediocre, or occasionally good student films. The quality of indies has really plummeted since the digital cameras are affordable, opening the field to more directors, and the closing of a lot of art house films due to indies not being particularly profitable. The only one to really make it work is Blum House. Frankly, I'd rather watch the occasional good Blum House film where they have a slightly higher budget and it's done by a director on the verge of going big, using Blum House as their stepping stone. The problem with starting small, doing SyFy films like a Leprechaun sequel, is execs see you only as a low budget director. All the directors I know who did SyFy monster films and sequels to get their start, like Lake Placid 3, or whatever, couldn't get of that level. James Cameron is one of the few exceptions, starting off with doing Piranha. But he was a genius, and I hardly think the directors of Freaks have that in them. They just seem like your run of the mill guys around LA who think they're exceptional but are telling the same old generic story, adding nothing particularly interesting or new. I just think there is better out there to watch, but if your bored, give Freaks a try.",Freaks
90,Golden_Hope,A Solid Movie Worth Watching,8,26 June 2020,I hadn't really heard much about this movie for some reason which is strange considering it came out last year. I'm also shocked that it didn't have any buzz because it is really great.It is slow at the start and kinda confusing but just enough so that you are not annoyed by it and want to find out more about what is going on.It is an interesting premise and after watching it i think this would have also made a great tv show as i feel like i want to know this world and explore what else is going on it in.It looks great too and the effects look pretty clean. It also makes such good use of the sets in a cleaver way. The majority of the move takes place on one set and i think they found a great way around spending lots of money and it is really effective.I think this film should have got more notoriety than it did and i think people should watch it. Keep in mind that the first 10 to 20 are a little slow and maybe put you off but work through them and I'm sure you will enjoy this movie.,Freaks

96,babyjaguar,"FREAKS: MUTANTS, ANTI-HEROES, ETC.",6,18 September 2019,"FREAKS co-directed/written by Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein tries to be different and original, but too much obvious references to X-Men (the idea of ""mutants"" being feared and hated by the human world). In this case, the ""freaks"" or ""abnormals"" are similar to ""mutants"", they are feared and hated by the ""normals"".What may keep one interested in watching this film, is probably the good performance by Bruce Deen and a nice debut of young Lexy Kolker playing the role of 'abnormal"" child, Chloe. Her looks and performance are reminiscent of a young Drew Barrymore as a pyro-kinetic child in the 80's film, ""Firestarter"".The story drags abit, but Dern's performance kept it steady, eventually the action gets better but the plot doesn't really go anywhere. Some of the optical effects are decent, again I give them credit in trying to reinvent the idea of ""mutant"" and the ""anti-heroe"" story, but it just wasn't a complete success.Also I add here a prior and really underrated film, ""Fast Color"" is almost the similar idea of a broken family (suggesting ""mutant"" and ""anti-heroes"" themes) with supernatural powers, who are trying to live in a normal world (while trying to be in control of their talents).",Freaks

106,GreyHunter,A nice little gem of a movie,7,11 March 2020,"This movie is yet another allegorical piece about intolerance and paranoia and/or the issue of terrorism. In itself, that's not a terribly original movie/book/comic book/TV concept. What makes this one stand out, however, is that plays out as a slowburn horror/thriller rather than an action movie or broad sociological drama. For the first half of the movie, the plot could go in so many directions that the intriguing possibilities keep the viewer's attention. Is there something off about the outside world? About the father? About the daughter? Is the surrealism of the initial 50s-ish suburbia viewed through the window going to play out in some unexpected manner? It's a genuine mystery made intriguing by the canny traversing of the line between suggestion and reality made possible by dialogue that is straightforward in its application but ambiguous in its actual meaning.As noted above, the first half of this movie plays out as a slowburn mystery; the second half becomes a more traditional action sci-fi, and while I don't mind a decent action sci-fi (Terminator, Total Recall, other movies that may or may not star Arnie), it is the weaker and less compelling part of the movie. It's not bad by any means. It's just less interesting than the original mystery.One last thing, regarding the child in the main role: The odds overwhelmingly favor the likelihood that the ""OMG KID SO ANNOYING!"" crowd barely in their teens themselves. It's astounding that so many people expect a 7 year old not to act like a 7 year old. Kids get angry, kids get scared, kids act out, kids have trouble understand the deeper issues (especially when the only adult in the given kid's life never tells her what's going on or why things are the way they are. We can, however, question the severity of the dad's approach.) Most mature adults, even ones without kids themselves, grasp this. There was nothing about Chloe's behavior that wasn't perfectly normal for a seven year old kid. And, yes, the premise of the movie require a younger child; it doesn't quite work if the lead is a 40 year old virgin.And the young actress handled the role phenomenally, incidentally.",Freaks

We've seen this kind of thing before, but the way this movie tells its story was actually really interesting. It throws you into this world and slowly gives you information about what's really going on, like an unfolding mystery. This made for a very engaging and entertaining film. I actually see real franchise potential, there are all sorts of stories that could be told that take place in this world that I would love to see explored, like a low-budget MCU. The performances in this movie are all really good, even the child acting was tolerable! The effects were decent and this movie has a lot of genuinely suspenseful, scary and shocking moments!

This is peak netflix originals garbage. It's the ultimate. Its THE movie that shows what digital distribution has done to the industry. It's a catastrophe from frame 1 to rolling credits. It's spectacular in its failure.I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. Actually it should be shown at film schools to show what NOT to do.20 minutes in and you're still in blatant exposition mode with no character development to speak of.40 minutes in and you're still stuck in a bizarre story about ice-cream that just wont conclude (more about that later).60 minutes in and there's a pyjama party complete with instagram-obsessed 9 yos I am concerned now, considering this is the network that produced 'cuties'.Thankfully grace park comes out of nowhere in some pointless development and ... point her gun at things that aren't there. I wish i was making this up. A magic bubble appears. We're told there's a mountain somewhere. Nothing makes sense anymore. The writer is on strike or had a stroke, it's impossible to tell the difference.It's not that the acting is bad - is that the script is braindead, actually it's zombified-level dead. It was written by an ice cream perhaps. Or worse. The dialog is outright laughable, that's for certain.The whole thing plays out as if the director was obsessed with the use of HDR , steady-cams and ice-cream. There's no story in there you haven't heard a million times. But in fact there's no story in there, period.First time i'd say this on imdb, but i want my hour and half back. If you get irritated at nagging children in psych-horror movies, let me tell you - your'e in for quite the a ride.I guess my favorite part was when the child rummage through the shopping cart for ice cream while his dad visibly bleeds to death in the kitchen (?). Then magically opens the safe full of glocks (?) so she can take 100 dollar for getting said ice cream (?). Then that same 6 yo child gets called a 'pussy' by a kidnapping creepy ice cream vendor (?). Then there's an argument about ice-cream (???). This is an hour in. The dad survives and the little girl yells at him for not giving her ice-cream (???????) The mind seriously boggles as to who wrote that and if they were in their right mind.Seriously this is really bad. The real horror is that this cost $310,000, 6 times more than say 'upstream color' or 44x the budget of 'primer'. I guess 305K went to the 'fake positive review' department.

And generally although there were some slightly weak moments, they didn't hurt the flow much, perhaps a bit more editing could help.
But the main characters delivered beautifully and all I could say is ""Bravo"", to the producers/writers for this interesting story.
Superpowers are a somewhat exhausted theme, but this was a nice take, the young lead was pleasant to watch, and was fun to slowly submerge in the moment of life of this weird father-daughter pair, which turned not what it seemed to be.Overall - very nice! 8/10",Freaks

As far as she knows according to her father the world outside their home is a dangerous place to be. The mysteries surrounding why that is a fact escapes Chloe while she struggles to find the truth of their situation. Desperate to be freed of her fathers paranoid controlling nature she decides to seek for this truth on her own terms. Chloe is drawn to a old man who appears in his Ice Cream truck music illuminating the cul-de-sac everyday. One day she sneaks away while her father sleeps and seeks out the source of the music, the old man reveals a shocking revelation that shows that either her father is vastly paranoid over nothing or is there something far more nefarious happening.This is one review that i won't indulge too much on a synopsis as i went into this film completely blind after seeing the trailer and heard everlasting good things about this film prior to watching. That mystery going into this film quite honestly makes it that much better. It starts a little slow which just only adds to the conundrum of what you're seeing, stick with it and everything falls right into place nicely for a satisfying conclusion. For such a low budget this film was executed beautifully. In my opinion buckle up for the reveal in the final act, it certainly delivers.",Freaks

I wasn't exactly sure what it was about but tonight decided I'd watch it. I really enjoyed it.Yes it is limited by it's budget. It feels more like a play at times with simplistic sets but it works. Yes it is a mixture of different movie tropes but it is a good mixture.The acting overall is very good. Since a 7 year old is the main protagonist then that actor has to carry it and she does. I believe she was actually 7 at the time. But I liked most of the characters although it was hard not to think of the father as a thin Jack Black. And then he puts the shirt and glasses on....The storyline felt odd at times but I thought they tied things up well. For example it wasn't clear why she'd go across the street if the father didn't come home. Or the first images of the woman in the closet. Although there were some story elements that were fairly superficial especially why grand dad was so anxious so soon to take Chloe into the mountain. He didn't even know the extent of her powers but on their second visit, he takes her to see the Agent. Even if Chloe had remained quiet in the restaurant, at some point she's going to break cover on the way to the mountain since granddad didn't tell her anything.I wish the last few minutes were slightly different. I still liked it but maybe too simplistic? I did want to see more of what had happened to lead up to all of this so there is great room for a prequel and with this ending, a sequel as well.Definitely worth watching.",Freaks

But I think too much weight was put on the young girl to carry scenes. She was not bad, I am not dissing her, but some directorial choices forced her to emote beyond what was necessary to carry the scene and those moments tended to lag.

FREAKS is somewhere in the middle.After seeing the decent ratings and reading some of the glowing reviews, I must say, I had somewhat high expectations going in to the movie. After about 45 minutes of very slow build-up, I was almost ready to turn it off (and I suspect many people will stop watching after 20 or 30 minutes). I'm glad I didn't though, because it did get better.At times the little girl can be quite annoying, but then she does something really evil and the annoyance goes away. There is some interesting scenes and some good ideas; I can see why some people think it could be turned into a TV series. But, by the end, it still seemed to be missing something. Perhaps different writers could have made a difference; or maybe it was just the budget that held it back. Whatever the reason, I just feel it didn't quite live up to the glowing reviews, my expectations, or its own potential. I give it a 5 out of 10.",Freaks

The first ten minutes or so are a little confusing but after that the pace picks up and your attention is gripped for the full duration of the film.

When things begin to unfold the story is complex and interesting, and the movie keeps the suspense until the end with constant surprises in events. In line with the series Heroes and could even be something like the early days of X-men. The acting is great, especially the little girl.

Yes, the acting is sub-par at times, unfortunately the young Lexy Kolker (Chloe) is not delivering the performance at a professional level that is needed for a character that is on screen 80% of the time, and the other actors have their faults too. The first scene looks like somebody pointed a camera at their daughter and told her to ""look scared and surprised"".
A word about the special effects, they are definitely not at the level of a large studio Marvel movie and some of the camera angles were a weird choice. The thing that works well for this movie is its plot. It keeps you in the dark in regarding to what is gong on for the first 15 minutes or so, and then slowly more and more details are reveals so that the weirdness turns up to have some logical explanation behind it. You will be intrigued and entertained all the way to the end.A movie like this is bound to have some plot holes in it but please don't let that stop you from giving this movie a chance, since overall this is a very impressive attempt by the writer/directors Zach and Adam and everybody who is slightly interested in this genre should watch it.

They have been quoted as saying they wanted to tap into ""paranoia about immigrants, Muslims, people of color, and various other outsiders who become victims and targets when a dominant population becomes afraid"". In saying this they display bigoted and prejudiced views about millions of people that they obviously have never met. Also, it must take a lot of cognitive dissonance to not even realize that they are portraying the ""immigrants and Muslim"" as mind controlling murderers. Yet according to their quote they think we are supposed to feel sorry for the ""freaks"" (immigrants and Muslims) I did have empathy for the freaks for the first half hour or so.

Although slow, it is interesting if a little underwhelming and could have done with a slightly faster reveal as it did start to drag on.The second half is slightly faster paced but could have been so much more with a few tweaks to the script, though perhaps the budget wouldn't allow for more.All in all a very good job from the 10 year old Lexy Kolker. I would recommend this just to watch a good performance from a child actor.Also, disregard any 10/10 reviews offhand.

The ending also felt rushed.I did read some reviews online (not imdb) prior to watching so maybe picked up the wrong vibe there as we all have different opinions and one persons ""hectic"" is not what bothers someone else.

She was cast as a Colon sleeper agent amongst the crew of the Galactica where she was in essence a 'freak' among the normals.

And i cannot take emil seriously for this role.Anyhow, this movie wants to a bit like cloverfield lane but it doesn't pass the creepy test.The first 30 minutes you are trying to figure out what is going on.. is her father insane, is she insane, is it some sort of a zombie apocalypse... none of that is clear and i feel that for 30 minutes of run time, they should have done a lot more with the setup.Then all of a sudden you get the matrix feeling. Again, the setup is pretty bleak and could have been executed better.And then basically after 30 minutes of nothing, in less than 10 you are bombarded with everything at once. The flow is as disjointed as this review itself. Basically we have some ""aliens"" who can control people after some accident. And they are targeted for extermination if they dont move to their reservation.. A little bit of a political bite here with the actual terminology used in the movie, but i want to say it wasnt meant to be real life parallels. And these aliens/whatever unlike in other kid becomes superhero movies, are a bit evil and lack morals as we define them.The movie starts now. 40 minutes after it actually began..The acting of ""chloe"" is brilliant. The changing facial expressions are spot on, but then there is emile hirch who ruins everything. Did i mention he was completely miscast in this?

If the first half was anything like the rest, were talking a great gem here. The last half makes up for it though. And the last 20 minutes will knock your socks off. The acting is surprisingly good for an independent film. Lexy Kolker as Chloe is the obvious star and gets all the attention and rightly so,with a convincing performance at such a young age, but Emile Hirsche and the obviously great character actor Bruce Dern are also extremely convincing in their roles. The effects were credible as they blended with the story, whereas many extraordinary abilities genre films, tend to overpower the story instead of serving it. They also allow you to suspend your disbelief far better than many of its kind. The producer and writer credibly illustrates the age old human reactions towards differences within humanity. Is it worthy of a sequel? Yes and no. Bigger budgets and the awards that they garner, seem to result in a lesser product on sequel. Especially in sci fi. Unless the producer and writer really has a handle on the story and suspense, with the effects that serve the story, and can rigidly hold to it, then the answer is no.

149,Her-Excellency,Pretty Enjoyable Ride,9,29 November 2019,"Freaks starts out (or so you think) as a film which promises to deliver some uncomfortable moments between an overprotective dad who may or may not be outright crazy as well as possibly dangerous, and his cute, socially-inexperienced, defenseless and mostly awkward little girl. If you know nothing about the film going in, like we did not, upon viewing the first few scenes, naturally, your mind can't help but run to all kinds of dark places, wondering where the filmmaker is going to take us.Well, where it goes, although the ride hits a couple of small bumps, are dark and eerie places touching on the horror genre, and then surprisingly, it pulls back and takes an unexpected left turn into something completely different.Much of the supporting cast is okay, but the real revelation is the outstanding performance by Lexy Kolker as the little girl, and just slightly less-so, although still great, her dad, played by Emile Hirsch. They pretty much carry the film. Bruce Dern also delivers, if not a riveting performance, at least a mentionable and memorable one. His role in their lives unravels slowly and is not completely understood until somewhere in the middle of the film. It takes a while to discern what his purpose truly is and for the viewer to see the entire picture. I enjoyed that.I also liked that the film lets the viewer decide for themselves if what they've witnessed is abuse, trauma, or something else entirely. I also like that while I believe the characters are used as a stand-in or metaphor for discrimination, it isn't anything that is heavy-handed or overtly pushed.All in all, I found Freaks to be entertaining, and that its concept had been well-executed and delivered.

Even if we assume that the average has the same ability strenght as the invisible grandfather, it is absurd that they are forced to hide. The father is able to manipulate time for God's sake! Sure, only within a small zone, but that is an unimaginably powerful ability in itself, and as we've heard, compared to the raw power of freak kids (who can destroy cities...) it's like nothing. Add to this the fact that humans can only identify freaks by the blood that pours out of their eyes (which can be easily removed, by the way) when they use some OP ability, it is simply absurd that ""mutants"" were forced into such a tragic situation.I don't want to accept that everyone as incompetent as Grandpa and Dad who were shot by a random detective. I would like to believe that the vast majority of the freaks are not completely retarded and are able to use their abilities meaningfully, at least to a minimal extent.

The acting itself was decent, but the characters designed for Emile Hirsch and Bruce Dern didn't elicit any sort of empathetic response from me.I liked the time warp stuff.

So you spend the first half of the movie wondering what's going on and the second half waiting for it to get moving again, which adds up to only a mildly enjoyable viewing experience.The performances are good, including the young girl who is the main focus of the story, so the quality of the acting keeps the movie from slipping into negative-rating territory -- but since it takes a while to get a handle on what the world of the film is like, it's difficult to feel invested in the characters or their situation.This storytelling technique is definitely preferable to opening narration, but jumping in at a point when a lot of unexplained events have already occurred can easily leave a viewer impatiently looking ahead for clarity rather than absorbing the story as it unfolds. It isn't until about halfway through when the characters start giving out exposition, but by then, everything they're saying is already understood, and it's just wasted dialogue delaying narrative progression.Worth watching on Netflix for those who like family drama mixed with low-budget superpowers, but doesn't break new ground in terms of storytelling and fantasy.",Freaks

Let our imaginations kick in. The acting was brilliant and Emile did a great job as the father. Reminds me of Jack Black in this movie. Many of you will remember him from Into the Wild where he played Chris McCandless.A friend of mine and myself do ""Netflix and chill"" once a week or so. She lives in Serbia and I live in Canada so we start the movies at the same time and talk about it as it's playing via Whatsapp. Very cool way to spend time with someone you've never met and may not ever meet.Anyway, there were some unexpected twists and abrupt violence but it wasn't gratuitous. Also, Grace Park is gorgeous. She looks like Michelle Malkin and many of you may remember Grace as ""Boomer"" from Battlestar Galactica(2004).

Nothing interesting, and too annoying.",2,25 March 2020,"First, the perspective of the girl is too limited - we only see things through her perspective, even though she is mostly restricted to the house alone. We get only a highly filtered version of what's going on in the world, and it's not enough to really understand anything. It's also very distant, so there's no sense of danger or urgency. It's just a girl stuck in the house wanting to go outside and get ice cream. Not very compelling.Second, once we do start getting an idea of the setting, it's very cliche and exaggerated. Some people have special abilities, therefore everyone else in the whole world is terrified of them and hates them and wants them all to die.
When every character in the movie, other than one naive little girl, is a foaming-at-the-mouth lunatic, it's kind of hard to connect to anyone or to suspend disbelief. Yes there are some extremists in the world, but when you try to make 99% of the population look like extremist nutjobs, it doesn't feel very realistic.Finally, without an engaging plot or likeable characters, the only thing left is the preaching.

The film is a multi-layered complexity of various themes - love and sacrifice, truth and deception, perception and misperception, righteousness and depravity, blurred by the agendas of the various characters.Academy Award nominee Bruce Dern is involved with a stellar cast that includes an especially strong performance by Emile Hirsh.

210,leonweis,"Good, but not freaking good",6,19 March 2020,"As some mentioned here... the main part of the movie one tries to figure out who are the goods and who are the bads. In the end this line seems very thin. One could argue that the freaks are only protecting themselves, but to be honest, that's not true. This also the reason I don't see any relation to Nazi-Germany. The Jews were innocent, while the freaks are in fact weapons.But leaving that beside I didn't know anything about the movie before. Maybe I was expecting more an horror movie or thriller, but not an superhero-slatter movie. That's maybe my fault, but I think they could have told the truth a little bit more in the middle, so that one can more enjoy these great powers.
Some aspects of the main story were unclear:1. Why was the grandpa so in hate with the dad? 2. How could anyone catch the mother with these strong abilities? 3. What kind of species are they and why
are they here?After all the movie tries to show the protective environment of an loving father disrupted by external rassism, but fails in its main thesis by giving the racists a reason to do so. It seems ""good"" that they can strike back, but due to their emotions these leads to tributes (like the innocent neighbors) which shows the moral dilemma.

Thoroughly enjoyable movie all the way through, I won't give any spoilers but have to say I fell in love with the Chloe character and actress portraying a 7 year old.",Freaks
242,grim2005,Glad I Saw This Overlooked Gem,7,26 January 2020,"Freaks is about a little girl named Chloe and her father, who keeps her locked in their house to protect her from the people outside who he says are trying to kill them. But her desire to venture into the outside world causes her to start rebelling against her father.I went into this movie with low expectations, because I actually mistook it for a different movie that's also about persecuted people with powers, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually really enjoyed it. (I wish I'd known about it while it was in theaters so I could have supported it, because I imagine Hollywood considers this sort of movie a risk.) It may even be in my top 10 for 2019.The movie feels somewhat like it was plucked out of the X-Men universe, comparable in many ways to Logan. A dark, grounded story with a lower-budget, smaller-scale and an R rating, about genetically-mutated people with powers. And just like Logan, I'm glad they made it R-rated, because, at least for my tastes, it definitely added an enjoyable dash of spice.Freaks definitely appears like a lower budget film, spending most of its time in a single location, with probably fewer than a dozen actors with any significant amount of screen time, but there are a lot of movies that do a good job with these limitations, and this movie is definitely one of them. The first half of the movie is almost entirely set inside the Chloe's house and from her point of view, so we are drip feed information about what is going on. It does a very good of setting up tension, and even when Chloe finally ventures out into the world for the first time, it feels surreal - almost dream-like - which just adds to the feeling of uncertainty about what is going on and where the movie is headed.It certainly isn't a perfect movie - hence my 7/10 rating - but what holds it back is less flaws and more just failing to reach the highest peaks in certain areas. The most obvious would be in originality. Its execution is great, but it's ultimately just another movie about some super-powered people hiding from the man. I'm also conflicted on the ending. Once everything has been set up fully, the direction we go, while it is interesting to watch, is a pretty standard affair. We don't get any twists or turns and no really unexpected events. You can pretty much tell where the movie will end up, which is not bad, but just not as interesting as it could have been.Overall, I'd highly recommend it to anybody who likes the sound of a tense, R-rated thriller about super-powered people. Definitely glad I watched it.",Freaks

247,whitetigerzone,Great Holocaust Allegory,8,16 March 2020,"To me, the most chilling scene in the film, and the best acted, was the scene where Dad has to try and calmly deal with the cagey ADF agent who comes to the door. It was reminiscent of the early scene in Inglorious Basterds in which Christoph Waltz ever so politely terrorizes a farmer whom he knows is hiding a Jewish family under his house. The plot really seems to have been inspired by stories like the Anne Frank story, and the stories of Jews who avoided being murdered by hiding or passing as gentiles. You don't know it, as you don't know what's going on, in the early scenes of the movie, with all these really weird games the father and daughter are playing, but you ultimately realize he's training her to do exactly that - pass as a gentile. And with good reason. The part where he takes her to the family that has agreed to shelter her in return for money, and they chicken out and turn around and betray them, that totally had the feel of something that could have happened under the Reich. Very chilling also when the little girl and her Grandpa pass a billboard urging people to turn them in and he has to explain it away so she's not scared. The X-Men like powers given to main characters in this story is really just a throw-away, the real power of this film is the exploration of people wanting a normal life in a society that wants to hunt them down and kill them.",Freaks
248,dylanworkowski,Underrated,8,29 March 2020,"I felt this movie had great acting and world building. Now i am one that can enjoy a slow build up, I know many friends who would have probably fell asleep during this movie but I was on the edge of my seat the whole way. I loved the child actress as I have felt most children stars can not capture the emotions, and I felt like this is what a child would do. She is seven years old and we follow her story, therefore we are learning these things as she does. The world is built upon slowly through the tv, the boards on the way to the park, and characters that act paranoid around them. The design and of the house and the effects they used for power gave me a more realistic environment and I loved this movie!",Freaks

It's Firestarter mixed with X-Men. Cannot call it an Evil Children film. Gotta think that this was a rejected X-Men script that was so awesome that it had to be made. Think it is going to disappear though and be forgotten. It has a horrible title. Freaks is the name of a another film. ""Abnormals"" would have been better, but still bad.

252,patsulli99,Wait For It,9,2 October 2020,"If you want a sci-fi or superhero movie that starts with a bang and never loses speed then you're in for an unpleasant smack to the kisser.
This is a slow burn. A horrifically realistic sci-fi-fi movie that has the balls to actually take time to show you what's going on rather than just telling you right off the bat. Admittedly the first half hour or so is pretty tedious but it is for a reason. It leaves you in the dark as to where it's going and when the pieces start fitting, then it starts clicking and then you realize that the not so amazing setup was actually really clever.
This one takes giving a chance but if you stick with it and you're a sci-fi fan, superhero fan or even just a fan of good old school not flashy storytelling, I'm willing to bet you'll enjoy this.

What I can say is that Freaks combines drama, psychological thriller, action, sci-fi and even horror beautifully.The story twist and turns; it encourages you to think one thing then gives you something better. The pacing is expertly managed with continual drips of minor revelation to hold your intrigue. The story is complex, but the excellent direction, acting and screenplay save it from being complicated.This is the kind of movie that could've failed in 101 different ways. It really had to be handled deftly, and it is. Every cliche and pit-fall is avoided while the execution is superb.See it, support it.",Freaks

Suspenseful, sci fi tale with strong acting and great visuals, some great emotion too.The magic of the first half keeps you guessing. However as with most good starting movies it does become a little undone and a little anti-climatic towards the back end of the movie. Otherwise a nice fresh twist on the sci fi genre.The movie follows what appears to be a father and holed up in a house in some kind of apocalyptic setting but you aren't sure what has caused this or what this is. You wonder at times if the father is the bad man and has kidnapped 'his daughter' but the true intent and setting slowly starts to reveal itself. It allows your mind to wander with the possibilities of how it will turn out and which way the writing will go. This actually gave me as writer a bunch of good ideas for future sci fi writing.No more risk of spoilers! If you like suspenseful sci fi tales you will enjoy this and the visuals are great too. The quality of acting is above par also which is nice for a new age sci fi movie. I was quite surprised how good this was! Along with a hauntingly nice soundtrack it makes for an overall movie that leaves a very little something with you (but not too much).Definitely worth a watch.Thanks MM.",Freaks

However, as the movie progressed and layer after layer was peeled back, I was rewarded with a very engaging tale. I feel like so many other reviewers are ""letting the cat out of the bag a bit"" by mentioning things that I did not know going in and might have spoiled that layer peeling I mentioned. So if this is the first review you read, STOP reading reviews. If you like Sci-Fi dramas and are good with a slow start but escalating and engaging story, then just go watch the movie, you will most likely enjoy it.

The script leads to a stupid ending and the way to that was chaotic, too. Circa the first half is acceptable, because the viewer doesn't know what's going on and so it is fairly mysterious and suspenseful. But the solution at the end of this movie is really dumb. In comparison to this piece any X-Men movie is a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the script.

Lexi Kolker is an amazing new talent and carried the whole thing.But I think the problem was in the directing and/or the editing. Character personalities became disjointed, inconsistent with their own character development, sometime so bad the story became incomprehensible.The first half of the movie was so unnecessarily S L O W it was a directorial crime. I would bet money a lot of people just turned the movie off after about a half hour. This left no time to flesh out the protagonists of the story, whoever they were supposed to be within the poorly defined plot.Again, this is a shame because it could have easily been an 8-star movie without spending one more dime.

The pragmatic husband character works very well with the curious girl who just wants to be normal while the best part, in my opinion, is the build-up of facts which make you realize what is real and what is not in their world, including their powers. Perhaps a bit too slow and cringy in the beginning which might put some off, but definitely escalates to in-your-face instant karma events and other thrilling scenes which make you cheer for this supernatural family every step of the way.

I've seen this movie suggested a few times but finally got around to watching and I'm pleasantly surprised by its complexity.THE CHARACTERS:
There is a trend of sacrificing character build in order to mash in action and mind-numbing plots. This movie doesn't do that. The opening scene drops us in to this Father/daughter, adult/child scenario. The beginning is a tense scene that grabs your attention. Other characters are slowly introduced at a rate that makes you not only question motives, but engages you in unraveling the mystery of these ""Freaks"". You are able to experience the dynamic growth of each character along side of them. But the most interesting spin of this movie experience, is the plot development through the innocent & precocious eyes of ""Chloe"".THE PLOT:
Its an old tale with an 'origin story' feel. The balance of what has been, but yet hasn't been; because of her inexperience with the world around the main character....is intensely clever. Just when you think you've figured it out, the plot twists just enough to be plausible. And though the ending is a tad predictable, it's still organically gratifying; in a poet way.
I didnt find many plot holes that reduced the quality of the premise. Though there were some unanswered questions, it was just enough to leave it open for a sequel; while not creating too many that this movie couldn't remain a Stand Alone.THE ACTING:
The acting by the ""Chloe"" and her ""dad"" was absolutely phenomenal.
The acting of ""Icecream man"", some felt was unnecessarily creepy. However, I felt, given his motoves, it made sense. And lent to the raw emotions of guilt riddled man.
The acting from main & supporting ""Agents"" was acceptable. Ive seen worse & better. As a whole, the actors portrayal of the ""Agents"" was fine. As far as decision making- I felt it was plausible and spotlight the juxtaposition of what government lackies SAY-versus-MEAN.
Overall-- I felt that any poor acting didnt overly detract from the movie experience.THE ENDING:
Predictable. Like every origin story, the hero/heroine/anti-hero has come in to their own, and the movie ends on a ""happy"" note; respectively.
BUT! Its not so predictable that someone will roll thier eyes at the over-used Hollywood formula. The growth of our young protagonist feels natural; understandable, given the circumstances. And despite the potential consequences... there is enough raport that someone might accept the characters paradigm shift.FINAL THOUGHTS:
All in all- I enjoyed the movie very much.
And if you like NOT being spoon-fed the entire movie during 'the Trailor'-->
You will probably enjoy this movie that starts off slow.... builds the characters... twist you with slow-burning suspense, sucker punches you in the face with unexpected action... and then leaves you scratching your head while simultaneously asking for more.",Freaks

She's a talent to watch.Everyone in the film is great, especially Bruce Dern and Emile Hirsch as Grandpa and Dad. Well cast overall.Lovely blurring of reality vs fantasy here. And the sets help that sensation. Major kudos to the set construction/decoration crew: really gritty and detailed.The CGI fits the film -- well-integrated and not gratuitous at all. Minimal exposition (very little info dump lets audience imagine the origin of the presence of the freaks). The major exposition half-way throught the film is a nod to that done within the original Night of the Living Dead -- tiny spoiler: news reports on TV.Pretty absorbing and enjoyable.",Freaks

325,rhett-46260,Slow-Boiled Mutant Sci-Fi,9,30 March 2020,"There are many reasons I enjoyed this film. Before I write reviews though I like to read other reviewers comments to get a sense of what people are holding onto. Let's start with the negatives, since I have many positives.This movie has one main problem that ""The Village"" and many other M Night Shyamalan films have which is that it can be extremely enjoyable the first time, and that you have to suspend certain realities and possibilities and trust the narration. For me personally, that's very easy because I enjoy the process of someone else's storytelling as much as the story itself, so I rarely come with any expectation. Certain aspects of the front end of the story would fall apart in a rewatching of the film, but to me, that's part of the beauty of the storytelling, because through much of the movie, we are seeing everything from the eyes of an isolated girl whose entire reality has been shaped to fear others. When she does experience the outside world through her powers, she becomes untrusting of the only person she's ever known.What we get on the flip side of this film is a full picture of a world that despises these ""freaks"" with powers and have systematically lied to them, imprisoned them, and zealously work to exterminate anyone remaining. The government being the government though wants to take the children to weaponize them, creating a clear sense of motive for a father who seems a bit paranoid.What worked well was the believability of all of the characters, the major themes of the world, and the struggle between people who are normal and those who aren't. What didn't work as well in selling all of these ideas was the dad didn't seem paranoid, he seemed genuinely compassionate and tired, the girl seemed unnervingly hateful, and the Agent seemed untrustworthy. I think some choices could have been made to sell the contrasts from the opening acts to the climax, but ultimately, what was successful for me is a scary world that I ultimately want to see these ""freaks"" thrive in. Plenty of room for subsequent films, and overall really well executed.",Freaks

Superb acting from all actors and actress.
Either you are normal or abnormal, the way and the sacrifice how the parents make for their child is always a tear jerker for me.

The young girl is an amazing actress.
The movie meanders through various film genres. Many of the negative reviews comment about the weird characters, but if you imagine it from the girls point of view, and how surreal her life would be it makes sense.
I'm not100% a fan of the ending. I think the rest of the movie was so well done that they could have taken this in another direction.

If you don't understand what is going on right away, be patient and pay attention. Also, use your imagination to answer some of your own questions. This is a movie and not a show so not everything can be answered in 2 hours or so. It's a little different and I quite enjoyed it. If you're not into sci-fi then I wouldn't recommend this movie. For the other reviews where some of you find the kid annoying must not have kids. Granted, I don't have kids myself but I didn't find the child as annoying. She's just a kid. Her father kept her in the dark and she had no clue what was actually going on until later. It's natural for a kid to want something if her father paints her this perfect world and tries to shield her from reality.

I initially wanted to see it because im a big fan of mr. Rumsfeld...i mean bruce dern. Hes gotta be about 114 years old at this point and yet still slowly..very slowly truckin along. But acting is what makes it such a great sci fi movie. Im not certain but it seems like the young lead actress is improvising a lot of her lines which for a 7 year old wouldnt typically be the anything worth writing home about. But she is simply perfect. Very believable along with emile and Amanda crew and of course mr. Rumsfeld. And really glad to see Emile in something this solid . Its been a minute.

You have to watch this movie, this movie have each different atmosphere as minutes go by.

I kill time by watching 3 or 4 movies per day, mostly was boring or forgettable plot movies. Believe me, this movie is special.
At first I thought this movie genre was like Saw, or hostel (Dad was not her real dad, a kidnapper that want to abuse her. But it turned to be wrong??). Then I'm guessing the grandpa was just an selfish oldman who want to sell this girl and it doesn't. And the final ending? Well, you have to watch it by yourself.
Praise to this 2 actors :
At the end,
1. I got a sad feeling to the girl for how she is being discriminated, hunted and peoples out there justify to make genocide of her kind. Her act is marvelous

Imperfect parents/grandparents, a suffering child, the intense and core desire for change, and magic. This movie has all that... and it matches perfectly to a fairy tale.I rate it 10/10 because, for a movie, I'm sorry but it's a very well-made movie.

There's clearly a growing fan base.
Original Review: I became entranced watching this film as it ever so slowly unraveled. Highly creative and dark, this is the kind of film you'll want to watch again to see how the clever foreshadowing all adds up. Keeps you guessing until halfway through, only for things to crank into high gear. I don't want to ruin anything for future viewers, so can't really explain much. Emile Hirscht is great as the seemingly crazy father and the young girl in the lead is fantastic. Also loved Bruce Derne. The title might make you think of a demented circus or something, but that ain't it. It involves a familiar concept, but in a Harsh, frightening and unique way you've never seen before. This film deserves more credit. I want a sequel! Or better, a prequel!!
Seriously, if you like weird, dark, cool, violent and epic all rolled into one? Watch it
(And now my answer to those that don't understand the majority of good reviews: your stupid, lack depth and creativity mainly. I'm baffled that people didn't like the movie because of how the girl behaved. Seriously?! The girl was raised isolated for seven years in a dilapidated house with a paranoid father preparing her to change her identity because the world wants to kill her! ( Which is true). Of course she's not behaving like a normal seven year old you idiots! Of course her mind has been twisted too early and she becomes angry and violent realizing the world hates her for how she was born when all she wanted was a normal life (til the end at least). I have a feeling most of these people are Marvel lovers who want everything super clear where the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are the bad guys, blah, blah, seen it a hundred times already. It's supposed to confusing at first of course (but there's clever clues - for the clever only apparently) and if you still couldn't figure it all out by the end? Check your IQ, everyone else got it. And anyone that really bashed the acting, let me guess, you let loved ALL the performances in the Twilight saga (Robert Pattinson been kinda proving himself okay tho). I want more of these realistic takes on the outright fear, violence, corruption and hatred that would probably likely occur if ppl really did have super powers in reality and not in a comic.

It starts a little slow and takes it's time to gain momentum, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, particularly given where it ends up.

They don't explain anything upfront and so you're left to try and figure out if the Dad is actually trying to protect his daughter, is she even his actual daughter, had the dad lied about the world outside, or are people actually trying to kill him Etc. But once the world falls into place it quickly turns into a chore to finish the movie. The father is probably the only character who feels like an actual human being. The grandfather starts out creepy which is understandable (since we don't know if we can trust him or not) but then he never changes, he gives of this dirty vibe for the entire movie. The daughter comes off as bratty and annoying, constantly yelling, not listening to her father etc. you would think a girl who was raised to believe people would kill her if she stepped outside wouldn't leave the house over something as simple as ICE CREAM. And the mom at the end lets the daughter save her, instead of the other way around.There are a lot of plot holes, the characters could have used their powers to get away multiple times and then safely saved the mom.

415,tmacmichalak,"Criminally underrated, Freaks continues to impress.",9,2 April 2020,"While the concept of the movie is nothing new (cloverfield), the staging, the pace and the story itself are so well intertwined. The characters are captivating and feel organic in their roles of the story. Good performances across the board. Lexy Kolker who plays ""Chloe"" is a tremendous child actress and steals the spotlight away from a very convincing performance from Emile Hirsch who plays Chloe's father.Freaks crosses genre boundaries often and does a good job of keeping you alert, it's not a film that can be lazily watched with a phone in your hand browsing social. Because of this it rewards the viewer with a rollercoaster experience that in the end is very satisfying if not bitter sweet.",Freaks

Had to look for a trailer online because I'd never even heard of it, and I keep up with new movies. Looked interesting and I said that this was gonna be either amazing or horrible. Luckily, it turned out really good. A scifi movie of the super variety, but it's more than just a power-fest, though there are very nice usages of them in there. A bit slow in the beginning (not necessarily all bad), but it ramps up fast afterwards (not necessarily all good). Also keep an eye out for the underlying, troublesome trait of the lead child. It'd be an interesting line to follow for future movies or a tv show (preferred). 8/10 on here, but a solid 8.5 on my scale.",Freaks

489,apple886,Not Sure About the Top Reviews,3,17 May 2020,"Some of the top reviews keep stating it's comparable to Firestarter or X-Men and seemed to be the same user under several accounts.Curious to know what Freaks had to offer I pressed play on this film and made it to the end (barely). The beginning led the audience confused with what was going on and what was the story. Only towards the end those questions were answered.For the entirety of the film I was not captivated and could not handle the main girl character the writers portrayed her as. This didn't had to do with the actors/actresses themselves. Acting was good but the dialogue, character development, and script was lacking.They built the character as unlikable, spoiled, unsympathetic or empathetic to reasoning. I'd expect being an only father realistically for 7 years to this child she would have developed a close father-daughter bond she wouldn't want to break. This was not the case in this film. Even towards the end the child still wanted things her way.Another high reviewer stated there was no obvious CGI. Most of the film can be seen as having CGI.Some outside scenes had overexposed lighting.Overall I'll give this film a 3.",Freaks

At first everything seems mysterious and nothing indicates this is kind of a X-man movie. I love how the things are getting disclosed step by step. This movie is a way better than any of those blockbusters. It is more personal movie where you can get in touch with the psych. It is not as all the other movies where everybody is trying to kill everybody, and where nobody is actually killed, or you really don't care about it.",Freaks

I say it deserves an 8.

Let their storytelling prowess strip away the blockbuster bombast and comic book hype. What's left is this distillation of thrilling discovery and yearning, carefully unwrapped over just 100 minutes.Pacing is perfect. In the beginning, we feel the frustration of Chloe. We want the truth just as she does! As the true nature of her world is revealed, the story quickens to a tremendous climax. I hope for a sequel of equal quality.

I've always said watching trailers spoils too much of the movie. I was right in this case. I didn't watch it and was oblivious to what was going on the entire time. I loved it!! It was so thrilling and confusing. It had me questioning myself over and over. And some point in the middle of the movie everything clicked. I started freaking out and it was the best feeling I've had in a long time watching movies. This is a true hidden gem that I'm so lucky to have found at my local library.",Freaks

I highly do not recommend it!",Freaks

516,pointblank7494,Desperately needed fresh air in today's political cinema,9,12 January 2021,"This movie refrains from following in the footsteps of so many movies today and remains mostly apolitical, focusing more on creating excellent character development, cinematography, and a very satisfying plot. Emile Hirsch, just as in the Autopsy of Jane Doe, delivers an excellent performance as the father of Chloe (Lexi Kolker-who may well have given the best children's performance in acting that I have ever seen) during this fantastic psychological thriller.",Freaks

519,j-zam02,Finally much anticipated movie I've ever seen,10,14 September 2019,I've been seeing the ads on Facebook and was super excited to see this movie way before it came out. Couldn't believe the day was here and the movie did not disappoint at all. Without a doubt going to see this movie again.,Freaks
520,majster-811-780988,Just meh,2,2 October 2021,"Solid cast and good performances by all the actors. Unfortunately someone pitched the idea of ""Let's do a movie where 'Firestarter' meets 'X2' but with a really limited budget and production values and see what happens."" And then it got the green light.",Freaks

524,emmie_h,Had such potential...,3,14 November 2021,I'll keep it short.The biggest ruiner of the film was the girls 'shouting ability' & her whole bratty attitude ...made me nearly turn it off several times. She just whines & screeches throughout the whole thing. Completely takes away from everything else the film has to offer.,Freaks
525,nvidiaboy87,I seldom write reviews.,3,6 April 2020,I seldom write reviews but when I do it means my soul Is saying to do it. So here it is. Whole movie was ruined by the kid. Such a poor character. So bratty so miserable. And clearly showing that since the kid has the power so she can kill. She literally got her dad and grandad killed. I mean as a kid we should feel emotions for her but I strongly feel she should be hunted down because she gives puts the f in freaks. She really is a freak for whom I only felt negative. And the last line of the movie was so bad that it shows if anyone bothers them then the kid is going to kill them. Yes go ahead make killing the solution of all your problems. There should had been a better way to put the side of freaks or abnormal. Bad portrayal of the kid. She is a great actor but her character was annoying and if that was my kid I would have done her upbringing in a very smart and positive manner. Also no history and build up for who are the freaks. They are living among us. It's like the movie starts in the middle and ends. But you are always searching for the start. Damn it. I am annoyed.,Freaks

527,karmsyndia-26414,"Great Plot, Great acting, Great special effects",10,2 April 2020,"Usually i would say a few positive feedback with at least one ""But"" this time, I have nothing to say. it is really well done and the lead actress Lexy Kolker did a fantastic job considering her age. She offered range in her performance. Even though this plot has been around (X-men, the gifted) it felt good to explore yet another aspect of it.",Freaks
528,sergiosousaa,Just another Firestarter,7,10 January 2020,"Had the privilege to see Drew Barrymore in 1984 ( Firestarter ) in the theather firing things up.
This story is almost the same, and i think that the producers thought that someone forgot Miss Drew on that movie.
Not a waste of time but a constinuous certainty that Movie makers are running out of ideas and betting in reruns or similar.
Love the cast though...",Freaks
529,csvt,Unwatchable,1,25 January 2020,The extreme overuse of the shaky camera technique is nauseating. This movie is absolutely unwatchable so I will give it the lowest possible one star rating. Stirling Bancroft should go back to film school so that he might film something that doesn't make people sick trying to watch it.,Freaks

538,rsneep,"Not a ""Hidden Gem""",5,8 March 2020,"I don't understand all the ""Hidden Gem"" reviews. Does they allow fake reviews?
I wanted to like this but I couldn't. The potential was there but the story fell flat. Bruce Dern's character was creepy and Emile Hirsch looked like Jack Black. I couldn't get past that. The girl's acting was good. All the other characters were were boring and the acting was fair.",Freaks

541,smartin-23542,Suspicious of the positive reviews,1,19 July 2020,"The fact a 10/10 review above had to declare itself ""not fake"" is suspicious enough in itself. I just had the misfortune of watching this.The little girl was so unlikeable, no disrespect to her acting abilities but producers, for some reason wanted to portray her as a spoilt, entitled brat. In one scene, trying to force her Dad to drill through his own face in order to get her own way. For some bizarre reason this was just accepted by the Dad, who hours earlier didn't even know his bratty daughter had any abilities. I don't understand why the Granddad was portrayed as a creepy, unwashed, dishevelled man...were producers going for suspense here? Trying for a plot twist?It seems a large portion of the problems faced could have been prevented if they didn't try so hard to emphasize the need for secrecy. The secrecy plot that ended up being dragged out within an inch of its life and then absolutely beaten to death.There was potential for something but the need for secrecy prevented any real plot progression. Not one likeable character in the bunch (a possible exception maybe for the mother who was the least unlikeable) and both parents completely indifferent to the fact their 7 year old has no problem forcing others to commit murder when things aren't going her way. Dad didn't even bat an eyelid at his seven year old daughter's new murderous tendencies. I don't know how I stuck around until the end.The positive reviews are just bizarre. Family and friends of actors and crew perhaps?",Freaks

543,ozball-05372,A thrill ride of suspense,10,11 September 2019,Best not to know anything in advance. Freaks is surprising at every turn. Don't miss seeing it on the big screen. Lots of emotion in this drama/ sci-fi mystery.,Freaks
544,ludmilasaputhanthri,A jewel!,10,4 November 2018,"You will be in a bubble in another word during the whole movie. The scenario, the rhythm, the colors, the actors... Are perfect. I do not want to say more about it because it is the kind of movie you have to experience by yourself.
Thank you to the directors for this master piece.",Freaks
