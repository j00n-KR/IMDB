0,phd_travel,Cute cast can't save mediocre writing,5,6 December 2019,A knight from the Middle Ages is transported to present times. A woman who knocks him over takes him in to live with her. Very plausible! Vanessa Hudgens is sweet as ever. Her costar Josh is an alright actor too. This movie could have been funny with the difference in time periods but the writing isn't high quality enough. Wasted comic potential. The ending isn't well explained. Is he just going to stay in the present and forget about his life in the past?,The Knight Before Christmas
1,A_Different_Drummer,A home run ... by Canadian standards,9,24 November 2019,"Canada has been churning these out for decades but this one is smoother and sweeter than most. Credit to the leads, esp. Hudgens who gives one of her better turns, adding an almost-Hepburn touch of class. Canadian accents barely audible.",The Knight Before Christmas
2,tabuno,A Typical But Much More Stress Free Holiday Entertainment,7,24 November 2019,"This Netflix Christmas holiday comedy romance offers up the by now typical time travel turmoil of a knight in the 14th century Norwich, England transported to 21st century Bracebridge, Ohio (though supposedly the actual location is the city by the same name in Ontario, Canada). What's a little different in this time period mix up between the possible romantic couple is that the surprising and relatively stress-free storyline that somehow even so keeps its audience entertained with a lot of time period oddities and peculiarities. It's nice for a change, in today's high-tension socio-political environment to come across a movie that doesn't require and involve a lot of melodramatics and instead offers up a pleasant and uplifting theatrical experience at this time of year.",The Knight Before Christmas
3,cruise01,Terrible.,2,28 November 2019,"The Knight Before Christmas (1 out of 5 stars).The Knight Before Christmas is a terrible romantic Christmas comedy film which plays around with the fun idea of a knight being sent to the future to find his quest. Which he runs into Vanessa Hudgens character and they both fall for each other. The film felt more like a lifetime channel straight to tv movie with its terrible acting, direction, and poor dialogue.The plot is cliché for a romantic comedy movie. A medieval English Knight Sir Cole (Josh Whitehouse) and his man are riding out for sport when he runs into a woman who has magical powers. Which for some reason she sends him to the future to go on a quest. For what kind of quest? And why? None of it was explained and it never comes back to it. He is sent to 2019, were he runs into Brooke (Vanessa Hudgens). Who she is love hopeless after a bad relationship. She finds love to be a joke. She accidently runs him over and she tries to help him. Thinking he has some amnesia and thinking he is a knight. She cares for him at home and tries to update him about the modern times. While he is trying to find a quest.The plot is dumb. Cliché. And stupid. Sir Cole helps Brooke out with a lot of errands. While they both are learning from each other. The script is filled with cheesy dialogue. The direction is horrible. The acting is terrible. Vanessa Hudgens is literally smiling in every scene. Even when she is expressing her hatred towards her ex boyfriend. She is stuck in one emotion which makes it unbelievable. Josh Whitehouse performance is even worse portraying a knight.Overall, The Knight Before Christmas is a terrible and one of the worst films this year. This is one sappy romantic Christmas movie that is not worth your time watching.",The Knight Before Christmas
4,matthewssilverhammer,So Bad...it's bad,2,11 January 2020,"Vanessa Hudgens is so thirsty, she'll let a dangerously insane homeless man live with her if it means she might get laid. Half a star upgrade for ""Before Christmas"" though, which is pure poetic genius.",The Knight Before Christmas
5,lisafordeay,Decent film with a familiar story,5,21 November 2019,"The Knight Before Christmas is the newest 2019 Netflix movie starring Vanessa Hudgens and Josh Whitehouse and tells the tale of a 13th century knight named Sir Cole who gets transported to modern day Ohio and falls for a young woman named Brooke who is a science teacher that doesn't believe in love(Enchanted and Kate and Leopold anyone). Of course Sir Cole has till Christmas Eve to find his quest and go back to Norwich England,but will he stay with Brooke or go back to Norwich?.
The story has been done to death,since the last fish out of water film was Enchanted which is one of my favourite movies and I also loved Kate and Leopold. Both films are better than this film but hey if you are looking for a silly romantic comedy with a hint of Christmas than check it out on Netflix. Personally I thought Vanessa Hudgens last Netflix movie(her netflix debut) The Princess Switch was better.C+",The Knight Before Christmas

7,joelwatchesmovies,"Hey Alexa, this movie's a dud",3,26 December 2020,"Hey Alexa, I don't mean to be a boiled-brained cod piece but this movie's a dud and your lifeless cameo only makes it worse. Cole's nonchalant fish-out-of-water chival-schtick is insufferable, and what exactly was his quest? To kiss a woman before Christmas? Cuz that's what it seemed like. There's no tension here save for Brooke's baffling heartbreak; instead, we get awkward conversations and grocery shopping and a shoehorned subplot about a down-on-his-luck dad. Nice production design though.",The Knight Before Christmas
8,laragi,The absolute worst holiday film,1,24 November 2019,What a waste of Christmas. It's so bad I had to watch Elf 2 times in a row to forget it.,The Knight Before Christmas
9,spasek,Passable Film...But Not By Much,6,22 August 2021,"I get it. With films like this, you pretty much have to suspend you disbelief and just go with it. Forget logic or even common sense. Half the time, films like this are just light, delightful fun. The other half, they just don't work.A 14th century knight comes across a woman who sends him to 2019. To Ohio under the premise that he fulfill a quest before being allowed to return to his time.Never mind the endless questions and astonishments that a knight sent almost 700 years into the future would have. A few are addressed, but again, just go with it.Sir Cole meets Brooke, a lonely and somewhat cynical high school teacher who has given up on love. Sir Cole has yet to find love at all, and so, as you can easily predict, they are a match.The movie would have actually really worked if there had been even a little bit of chemistry between Hudgens and Whitehouse. Hudgens looks like she's trying hard not to clinch her jaw half the time. Whitehouse looks as though he's determined to make the most of his role and have some fun.There are scenes where Hudgens makes her character come across as annoyed...even in scenes where her character isn't supposed to be. I've seen Hudgens in roles where she's immersed in her character and she makes it work. This isn't one of those films.Now Emmanuelle Chriqui, who plays Brooke's sister, is far more delightful and believable. Perhaps Hudgens and Chriqui should have been allowed to swap roles. It would have worked better for the film.It's hard to enjoy a movie when one of the actors clearly isn't invested in the role. Most of the emotional scenes look forced and disingenuous from Hudgens, and the film suffers because of it.",The Knight Before Christmas
10,skpn123,Fun Nonsense,8,2 December 2019,Do not expect any logic or intellect here however in contrast to other Xmas movies I watched today this one is not grating and irritating. So if you are looking for no-brain enjoyable fun this is your movie. It is a somewhat unique and fun story.,The Knight Before Christmas
11,LukeCustomer2,Reasons,4,26 November 2019,"Very poor movie imho. I would sum it up with one word... ""reasons"". The story is so glaringly bad I just can't watch it unless I say ""reasons"" when my thinking mind wants an answer. A knight from the 1300s is sent to modern day to complete a quest... (say it with me) why? Reasons. Said knight speaks perfect modern english... I mean they don't even try to have him have trouble with it.. and ends up in the home of Vanessa Hudgens who isn't the slightest bit concerned about having a total stranger in her home, why? Reasons. Knight is in no way freaked out or scared of the modern world.. why? Reasons... oh I am sure the rest of the plot was riveting but I couldn't make it past the scene where Vanessa comes out in a slinky skin tight red dress and this man from 1300 doesn't say anything (or do anything) politically incorrect. Frankly, I hate to offend but Josh Whitehouse is not right for a leading man. He is goofy looking and thin hardly someone you would think would be a knight. His character is nothing more than an over grown man boy, as you know, you would find in a 1300's warrior.",The Knight Before Christmas
12,Ahmedfadil00,My opinion,6,23 November 2019,Funny light film .. Love always triumphs .. It made me very happy this film,The Knight Before Christmas
13,snowfre,A movie that grows - very slightly on you - but still leaves you with a completely bland taste,4,3 January 2020,"""The Knight Before Christmas"" (only that title discourages me from watching it) is a film of the medieval knight Sir Cole (Whitehouse) who arrives to modern-day America and falls in love with a girl named Brooke (Hudgens) in the days leading up to Christmas. That's the very delicate plot that leaves you with, basically, no questions. You see, we know how this film will end from the very start. And the start will make you hesitant to continue watching it. The scenes taking place in England, featuring some horrific special effects (few but still horrendous) almost made me turn of the film. But I kept watching it and somewhere along the line I felt like I could raise the score from 3 to 4. The chemistry between Hudgens and Whitehouse is indeed very good and I assume they do the best they can with the uninspiring script. However, the whole premise of a young woman letting a man claiming to be a medieval knight sleep over in her house is strange, and unsettling even. The scenes (that are supposed to make you laugh) in which Sir Cole stands clueless in front of modern era everyday things are not really that funny either and at the end this whole film stands and fall with the romance between the two main characters. And they pull it of quite well in that sense as there are several charming moments between the two. Could ""The Knight Before Christmas"" become a yearly Yule tradition? NEVER! Does the last scene hinting a possible sequel frighten me? More than anything else and suddenly, the holiday spirit was long gone.",The Knight Before Christmas
14,royhectorkabanlit,Mediocre Christmas Movie,4,25 November 2019,"Derivative and predictable, your typical ""Fish out of Water"" movie that has been before to death. I guess this one is for the new generation, but it just felt overall flat to me. Vanessa Hudgens does turn on the charisma a lot in this movie, but even her was unable to save it for me.",The Knight Before Christmas
15,edicionccq,The Cliche Before Christmas... What were you expecting?,6,23 November 2019,"Netflix is known for many things. His awesome fairytales of Christmas aren't one of these reasons. Usually, when it comes to live action movies for Christmas, Netflix releases average movies with known actors like ""A Christmas Prince"" with Rose McIver from ""iZombie"" or ""The Princess Switch"" with Vanessa Hudgens or ""Let it Snow"" with a full cast of Netflix's All Stars.
But the case today is ""The Knight Before Christmas"" with again, Vanessa Hudgens. This movie is a total cliche and with the format that we already have seen this year with ""Noelle"" from Disney+.
The movie is so repetitive you already know what's going to happen and how its going to end. But you still give it a try cause it's Vanessa Hudgens and you need to make the price of that Netflix account worthy. The movie is hardly decent, the characters doesn't even have weakness, they are almost perfect. There's not fundamental problem in this movie. The only reason why this is almost decent is the acting. Hudgens and Whitehouse has such chemistry that you support them, and the message is excellent for kids. So this movie is basically to watch in family these holidays.",The Knight Before Christmas
16,jml1988,Expectedly cheesy but cute and unique,7,25 November 2019,This was a bit of a different concept than most cookie-cutter clichéd Christmas movies. It was charming and enjoyable despite me not being a fan of the main actress.,The Knight Before Christmas
17,novux,A cute and fool film,4,28 June 2020,"The vast majority of romantic Christmas movies are stupid but at least they are a guilty pleasure, this is a shame, nothing interesting and the big problem of returning is solved in a scene like ""oh you're right, although the whole movie was about that""Anyway, yeah It was a cute, funny, cheesy and romantic film that it's easy to watch with ice cream and pizza on a Saturday in December.",The Knight Before Christmas
18,ScoobySnacks66,"Vanessa Hudgens becoming the Netflix Christmas Queen, and that's a good thing.",7,27 November 2019,"Another Netflix Christmas original starring the ever lovely Vanessa Hudgens. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should the viewer. The sets are beautifully decorated, Vanessa's outfits are stunning and the warm Christmas magic and silly romantic jokes are amplified by the charming co-star, Josh Whitehouse as Sir Cole. This film has many plot holes and ridiculous, even eye-rolling, moments, but seriously, just suspend some disbelief, pour yourself some Noel Nog and enjoy the charming chemistry and warm Christmas spirit the two leads bring.",The Knight Before Christmas
19,liderc,"Great production values, horrible script",3,4 January 2020,"The production values of this movie are amazing - also on a large TV the costumes and setting are a feast for the eyes. The two cute leads also charm their way amazingly well through a script that is neither funny nor intelligent in any way. The thin and bland plot full of ""romantic"" stereotypes is further riddled by clicheed dialogue in nearly every scene and cardbox characterizations. The most unintentionally funny scene for me was when the mother tries to soothe her daughter with the tired old feminist / narcissist mantra: ""You can be anything you want to be!"" And what if she wants to be a toaster ;o)
So, this Christmas movie is really not worth wasting your time on, even as family entertainment.",The Knight Before Christmas
20,tocanepauli,It's a Xmas movie.. enjoy,8,24 November 2019,"A wonderful Christmas story ! Sit back, grab a glass of mulled wine and enjoy the lovely tale. Great story with lots of Xmas feel good meaning. Well acted and fun.",The Knight Before Christmas
21,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,This was really bad,4,24 November 2019,"Vanessa's acting never changes from film to film. Where is her depth? I don't want to nit pick but there were too many things about this movie that left me like ""come on, man!"" And yes, I realize that it's a Christmas/Hallmark/Lifetime type movie, but still. For example, he clearly has no license but yet she allows him to take her SUV? He somehow manages to drive and that entire scene makes absolutely no sense. When he gets back home he just leaves his entire life and his brother, and the brother doesn't ask him where he is going, will he ever see him again, etc? He doesn't tell him about how he time jumped? Nothing?Yes, the movie is cute however, it's only fluff, nothing more so make sure you have your expectations in check.",The Knight Before Christmas
22,GavWaskett,The clues in the title!,7,12 September 2020,"Did you see what they did there? It's about a Knight and it's set a few days before Christmas. A Knight gets sent forward in time to complete a quest, but also sent to the other side of the world to a country that wasn't recognised in the 14th Century and he takes the whole ordeal really well to be honest, not fussed at all and even loves a bit of Netflix(with added little advert for Holiday in the Wild thrown in). I haven't got to the end yet, but reckon I watch enough films to know what is going to happen. Somehow Medieval Knight and Modern-Day Science Teacher will fall in love and be able to spend their lives together - prediction made! A bit of Christmas Eve nonsense for the family.",The Knight Before Christmas
23,lenusme,It was expected,7,17 May 2020,"It's one of those cheesy Christmas stories so taking that into consideration it was not that bad. Actually, I enjoyed Vanessa Hudgens charisma even with such an absurd plot.",The Knight Before Christmas
24,CelluloidDog,Want to like but so weak all over,2,28 November 2019,"Sometimes a movie isn't worth making or watching. Sometimes we think a Christmas movie has an excuse to be bad since it's a naive family movie. In reality, It's A Wonderful Life, Home Alone, Miracle on 34th Street, A Christmas Story or...even Bad Santa are superb examples of Yuletide quality. Acting was weak or almost horrible with a poor, uninspired script; only Sir Cole's lines hold any chance at redemption. Vanessa Hudgens is so likable and cute but drowns in a flood of terrible lines and expressions. Joshua Whitehouse stays a bit above water as he occasionally is given moments of light wit and comedy. Production quality and direction is very weak. One feels like it's a pharmaceutical commercial, so innocuous and bland. Cinematography is...well, nonexistent. I would strongly recommend watching the very fine Kate and Leopold - with Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman - which Knight seems to copy inferiorly adding a Christmas flair. 2.5/10.0",The Knight Before Christmas
25,hmb-51778,One star off for the sad wigs and clothes on the female lead,9,14 December 2019,"This movie has sufficient female gaze and the male lead is in transparent tops and lovely clothes, which is odd - since the female lead's clothes are so terrible I kinda wonder who's clothing line this might be.There's so many bad wigs on so many featured roles it becomes a running theme.But if you can look past these C-grade issues, and the typical overreliance on Christmas Movie tropes - the really unredeemable Ex to the Let's be Nice to the Less Fortunate schtick. It follows a tried and true recipe.I would go after them for the central conceit but it says right on the label: Knight from the Middle Ages is transported to the current day. So that's what you get.Our leads are adequate to the job. The secondary folks are underwritten to the point of caricature. But they give it their all.Our male lead fills so many of the requirements: drop dead beautiful, plays sincerity and the more obnoxious elements in the script, and has the presence to play his subtlety when ham might have been served.I even enjoyed the sequel setup.Mindless Christmas entertainment.",The Knight Before Christmas

27,t-09253,Good for x-mas...,4,6 December 2019,"Yes, the movie has many flaws as far as writing, directing and acting go.Yes, it is cliché (a lot).But it perfectly depicts what a Christmas movie should be about. Seasonal movies, in my opinion, are not meant to be works of art, but instead a tool/device/vehicle to remember the public what the season should be about. Add to that the chivalry code, honor and bravery and you have this movie.",The Knight Before Christmas
28,Lew777,It's so bad.........it's good !!,6,17 November 2020,"I tried hard not to like this film. It was certainly corny & cliqued with an unbelievable script. However , it was definitely cute and had good showing from Vanessa Hudgens & Josh Whitmore as the eponymous Knight. It had all the usual time-travel analogies, some totally ridiculous too ! However, there's a lot of people who'll love this film, the scenery, the good-looking actors and feel it was a fine time to while away an hour or two ! Yea Verily !",The Knight Before Christmas

30,Pete-Claus,A glitch midway through,6,30 December 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie, and even well into it, I did. It is charming. It is fun. The lead actors are likable and appealing. I had no problem applying the ""Willing Suspension of Disbelief"" in order to enjoy an interesting plot.Problem is, at the 37 minute mark, the scriptwriters went overboard and had the female lead character make a stupid, dangerous, illegal decision merely based on an assumption, which the character made no serious attempt to check out, and for which no good reason had been provided in the plot to believe in the first place. This was also out of character. It went way beyond the extent of disbelief I could willingly ""suspend"", and it also broke the charm of the movie for me.I enjoyed the remainder of the movie after that, but not nearly as much as I would have without that bad decision scene. (I would say more, but then it would become a ""spoiler"".) If you watch the movie, my advice is to just ignore this little bit of idiocy, if you spot it, and carry on with the rest of the plot, which is nicely done.",The Knight Before Christmas

32,olivewahh,So bad that it's good,7,23 December 2019,"A year has past since Netflix released it's Christmas film, The Princess Switch, and while we wait for the sequel to be released in 2020, we are provided with yet another Christmas themed film staring the one and only, Vanessa Hudgens.When Sir Cole (Josh Whitehouse) participates in a royal hunting game, he finds himself alone in the woods where he encounters an elderly lady shivering from the cold snow. Offering his service to help the lady to shelter, she sees the kindness in his heart and gifts him with a glowing object that time travels Cole from the 14th Century to the current modern day.Being transported to the middle of a Christmas festival, Cole wanders around in confusion and finds himself bumping into Brooke (Vanessa Hudgens) where the two have moment that only two strangers could experience in a romantic film as they share a long pause and stare into each others eyes.The two go their separate ways, but it's not long until they find themselves bumping into each other once again where Brooke learns quickly that the man she just met has no where to sleep. With no concern of what could happen, Brooke offers her guest house to the handsome knight which he accepts with a gentle smile.As the days get closer to Christmas Day, the two bond as Brooke teaches Cole on modern day devices and surroundings, while Cole shares details on his family history. However just as the chemistry starts to rise, time becomes shorter for Cole and he must quickly learn how to use the glowing device to travel back to his century or be stuck in the present.It seems Vanessa Hudgens has found her calling, and that is staring in Christmas films, which I am here for. I find her choices in roles to always have a very likeable character that boys and girls can relate to.
I do wish that in future films, she would change up her appearance as they all share a similar look. However Vanessa always delivers an impressive performance in each role, separating her characters from one another.The Knight Before Christmas is an enjoyable film that provides plenty of cliche scenes and heart warming moments that whole family will enjoy.",The Knight Before Christmas

Sure, it is cliche and predictable but if you are looking for a feel good, romantic Christmas movie then look no further!The leading actor and actress are simply adorable together and I really enjoyed their chemistry. Truthfully it seems like this movie could have worked with or without Christmas but taking place during Christmas time just makes it all the more magical.I wish they would have gone into more detail about who exactly the old crone was and what her deal was. Obviously she was a sorceress of some kind but why would his ultimate quest be to fall in love with a girl from the future? I feel like maybe it would have been better if he had to be propelled forward in time to save her from something. But maybe the witch was just able to somehow tell that his soulmate was in the future. Regardless, it is very enjoyable.I was very pleased that in the end it shows the old crone targeting his brother too because it made me very sad that the two brothers would never see each other again. This scene obviously implies that they are going to be reunited but again, I don't really know why this old woman is so intent on sending knights into the future. Maybe she foresaw that the future world needed them more than the current world?Very funny and inoffensive humor throughout the movie as well. Well done by all!",The Knight Before Christmas

That must be seriously confusing, but there was no room in the story for any depth in to dealing with this matter.The movie felt superficial, robotical and incredibly staged.

44,malpasc-391-915380,Formulaic Festive Fun,7,13 November 2021,"What would we do without Vanessa Hudgens Netflix Christmas movies?! She's done what seems like a hundred of them in the last few years!That said, they're generally fun and feel-good. This is no exception. Horrible historical inaccuracies included. Firstly how a knight from 14th century England and a woman from modern day Ohio (actually Ontario) would remotely understand one another given in Merrie Olde Englande back then people didn't actually speak English the way we do now, and that even if time travel were possible someone from mediaeval times crashing into the modern world would be more than freaked out and probably require serious psychological treatment for the shock!Anyway, this doesn't matter. What we have is a fairly formulaic tale of a lovelorn woman taking in our time travelling knight after he suddenly appears in the middle of the road of a small American (actually Canadian) town and hits him with her car which he thinks is a steel steed.Nothing particularly unexpected happens. The true meaning of a small town Christmas movie Christmas is what happens - people doing good deeds for those less fortunate than them, a small amount of drama about some kids needing rescue, and both Brooke and Sir Cole realising they're in love with one another. Totally formulaic with almost no surprises.That said both the leads play their parts very well and do seem to have genuine chemistry. The whole thing plays out as quite snappy and fun. And ultimately that's what you want in a Christmas movie. It doesn't need to be high art or high drama. Instead you get pretty scenery, great looking charming leads and a sweet story that gets you in the mood for the festive season.You can see the ending a mile off. In fact you can see most of what happens in this movie a mile off! It doesn't matter. It does what it says on the tin and pulls it off quite well.",The Knight Before Christmas

Why not for adults too, if you are looking for something easy and light and just want to relax.But for me the acting was so clumsy (well, Vanessa was kind of okay) and dialogue was written so badly that I just couldn't enjoy it. The knight wasn't natural at all and and didn't have any charm even though he tried so hard to be cute and charming. And the main couple had so little chemistry that it felt forced.Even when there is everything you want in a Christmas movie, is still lacks that magical and fairy tale like feeling. There is magic in the plot, but the viewer doesn't feel it and the movie is overall flat and boring. It didn't make you feel anything, it just passed by.",The Knight Before Christmas

You know I don't have any plan to love you but I did! It's my life's worst decision. Even I don't know what you feel for me. Indeed I love you more than I loved myself. Nowadays you are the most important thing to me. Why I fall In love I don't even know. When I see your eyes I just feel my heart is stopping betting. Never criticize love and compare anythings.Always romantic movie has their own feelings. If we see this type of movie we think if I was there. The same things happened to me. This movie is awesome and has fantastic own vibes. This movie's plot is stunning. Some things different we see this movie through. A romantic movie means a lot of love seen we think but that's not true. Every romantic movie is fantastic in its own way. If I talk about this movie I can't tell any word of this movie. This movie's plot stands from 1330 to 2019. A knight comes from to find his goals and fall in love with a girl. He even doesn't know what is a modern world is. Not even know about modern technology. This movie is tell me why I can't love a girl like that or fall in love. But the reality is another dimension. Movie love is always fantastic but real-life love is dangerous for health.

In the 1300s yeast was not invented, they were using sourdough for bread making. Commercial yeast was invented and used in the mid-19th century.But in the meantime the story was entertaining and it had some funny parts of how a 14th century knight acted in the 21st century. It was sad, funny and happy.However, when the Knight meets the old sorceress the make up and costume could have been done better. I mean that the eyebrows looked like its been glued down and painted with white. Why would you do that?Also the setting doesn't make sense... A 1300s knight from England ends up in Ohio in AMERICA (!!?)to the 21st century. The two thing is just weird. Why did he needed to time travel 7 centuries, and to a totally different continent to find his true love?",The Knight Before Christmas
75,ChristmasMovieReviews,"Feels like a ""title first, script second"" affair",5,24 November 2020,"In the past few years Netflix have realised that there's a huge market to be captured by muscling in on the Hallmark Christmas movie formula. Generally the streaming giant have been reluctant to tamper overly much with that formula, which has its good and bad points. Largely, though, it means predictable cosiness all round with a script that could have been written by a bot being fed festive pun titles. In fact, The Knight Before Christmas strongly gives the impression of a Netflix exec conceiving of a title first and only commissioning someone to flesh it out into a screenplay as an afterthought.What that title points towards is a fairy tale romance where all a modern gal is missing is a really, really old fashioned guy, like centuries old. Yes, we're firmly in Kate & Leopold territory here with time travel allowing us to indulge in a fantasy of old school chivalric gentlemen without any of the problematic, messy parts of history.Yes, history pedants are going to need to get off here, because Sir Cole (a man with the least medieval English name imaginable, at least Sir Chad would have shared his name with the medieval Saint Chad!) comes from no recognisable version of the actual Middle Ages. Mind you, such pedants probably struggle with the whole time travel genre, given that the characters speaking different languages would provide an instant stumbling block for a ""realistic"" take. This is a cosy romantic fantasy, so you've just got to roll with its fantasy version of a medieval knight as well. Having said that, and as this is essentially a fairy tale fantasy, it is a bit odd to give Sir Cole such a specific point of origin: Norwich in the 1330s. That was an era in which King Edward III waged war with Scotland and France, so there's probably knightly duties that range beyond a spot of falconry and time travel. Given that there's a name check for fantasy kingdom Aldovia (from A Christmas Prince, there's a lot of synergistic cross-promotion for other Netflix festive offerings here), why not just have Sir Cole be a knight of medieval Aldovia instead and remove any concerns about this fantasy's disconnect from reality?Even the non-pedantic will find a few of Sir Cole's culture clash, fish out of water moments don't entirely make sense. His solution to needing food is to hunt a skunk with his sword (I'm pretty sure medieval knights understood the concept of buying things from a shop). Meanwhile, he views cars as ""mechanical horses"" (and not the far more obvious comparison ""horseless carriage""), but is nevertheless completely capable of driving one a few scenes later. Like I said, there's a lot you just have to roll with.Most clunky is Sir Cole, whose whole point in the story is to be a paragon of old fashioned chivalry, keeping referring to women as ""crones"". That's just not polite. Otherwise, Josh Whitehouse (romantics may recognise him as the poet with poor eyesight from the BBC's Poldark) acquits himself pretty well at the clean cut gentlemanly manners and charm part of chivalry. (Albeit less convincing as someone who'd have to be an elite battlefield troop. It's hard to imagine Whitehouse in his rumoured role in the cancelled Game of Thrones prequel).Our heroine is Vanessa Hudgens as a teacher in an Ohio small town that's, let's be real, barely less fantastical than the movie's version of medieval Norwich. The erstwhile High School Musical actress is just the latest in a long line of former teen stars whose long term career prospects lie largely in formula genre TV movies. It's a good fit for Hudgens, though, who has a warmth and down-to-earth likeability that make her a good fit for unchallenging romance leads. It's no surprise that this isn't even her only Netflix Christmas movie.Hudgens and Whitehouse don't exactly have sizzling chemistry, but they do seem cute together. And that's kind of symptomatic of the movie as a whole: nothing spectacular, but does its job well enough. If you're a sucker for a festive fairytale and don't ask too many questions about how any of this is supposed to work, then this is the movie for you. For anyone else it's basically formula fluff.There's sequel bait at the end for Another Knight Before Christmas and, honestly, it's hard to imagine it not just being the same movie again. It could work, though, if instead someone from our time went back to this movie's version of the 1330s. Now that I would watch.",The Knight Before Christmas

79,barnandkaren,"As Christmas Fluff Movies go, they don't get much better than this.",8,21 November 2019,"The Knight Before Christmas (2019) 12 NetflixOK, Christmas Crapola fans, what is it that elevates the good cheesy Christmas movies from just plain old crapola? The Knight Before Christmas provides us with the simple answer. It's acting. In terms of content and narrative, this Christmas film is no better than the likes of Santa Girl, but it is so much better. A knight from 14th century Norwich, England, time (and distance) travels to 21st Century Ohio, USA to fulfil his quest, with predictable consequences. That's it. However, producer Vanessa Hudgens uses a decent budget well, providing a lovely festive backdrop, an entertaining script and, crucially, actors that aren't embarrassingly bad. You've got Hudgens herself (her off of High School Musical) who has previous for elevating Netflix Christmas Crapola having done it in last year's The Princess Switch, and Josh Whitehouse from Poldark. Both can actually act and have plenty of that elusive, crucial quality needed in a Christmas film: charm. Seriously, how difficult is is for casting directors to find actors that can, you know, act? It makes ALL the difference.Other plusses: The Englishisms (pronouncing Norwich correctly, saying Father Christmas and 'Happy Christmas') show that someone had a clue and an eye on the details, Vanessa Hudgens splashed a fair chunk of her budget on her wardrobe which will be of interest to some, and we have a handsome cast.In a nutshell, The Knight Before Christmas is top notch Christmas Crapola.Christmas Cheese Rating: 10/10 Not a single opportunity to display Christmas lights, trees, wreaths, jumpers, baubles, candles, ribbons, wrapping, hot chocolate in red mugs, holly, etc. is wasted. The fairy lights budget must have been astronomical. Excellent work.Snow Rating: 8/10 Lots of snow, and it mostly looks legit, but there's the odd scene that close inspection shows they were filming out of season and someone had to get handy with the fire extinguisher. But mostly it looks good.Actually Any Good Rating: Always remember that this mark is not given by measuring it against The Godfather and Schindler's List, but by comparing it to other Christmas Crapola. Which means The Knight Before Christmas is comfortably 10/10.",The Knight Before Christmas

I love that this is a time travel movie where the driving force isn't how confused and freaked out the traveler is, over and over again. Cole is clearly a renaissance man, looking for his mission as a knight. He keenly observes everything, and learns quickly from his observations. It's clear that he doesn't spend too much time questioning what he doesn't know or understand, and is open to the fact that just because something can't be logically explained, doesn't mean it isn't possible. Instead, he focuses on the moment, and what matters. Being kind, compassionate, and level headed. I also like that Brooke is accepting and accommodating. I think Vanessa did a great job.Is this movie perfect? No. But it's cute, funny, enjoyable, and very sweet. It's not a 10, but I've already watched it twice with my wife and enjoyed it both times. For that, it's a 10 to me. Not to mention all of the ridiculous grinches who give this great, feel good flick such a low rating. It certainly deserves better.Bring on the sequel!

107,banjo-peppers,Silly But Cute,7,26 November 2019,"The bottom line is, if you like romance novels, and you like Hallmark Christmas movies, you'll probably like this. If you're someone who notices every continuity error and also you're an English history buff, you'll probably be too distracted to enjoy this film (the titular knight is from the 14th century but speaks perfectly understandable English? The women in the 14th century have some crazy heavy makeup on - although the costumes are actually close to accurate, they aren't in generic Renaissance garb).Being mostly familiar with Vanessa Hudgens from her work in the High School Musical franchise, I was pleasantly surprised. Nobody's performance is Oscar-worthy, but everyone including her was charming and believable.I love Christmas movies, especially silly romantic ones, and I'm definitely adding this one to list of ""cute movies that I don't have to pay a lot of attention to when I'm in the mood for something Christmas-y"". Like I said, if you enjoy Hallmark channel Christmas movies, and romance novels (that aren't bodice-rippers), you'll most likely enjoy this film.

I'm a sucker for feel good trashy Netflix stuff from time to time and this fits perfectly on that list.
The screenplay wasn't bad and the main actor (Vanessa Hudgens) is an absolute treat to watch (I've got a bit of a crush xD).

It was cringe seeing Hudgen's character take a complete stranger in her home like that's so weird and unrealistic. I feel like the movie could've added flashbacks or a backstory to maybe make sense of why the time travel to another time was necessary to find love as well as why the knight was so adamant about fulfilling some dumb quest. Honestly it felt rushed not gonna lie I wasn't feeling the chemistry tbh but I think it was really cute movie but should've added more thought through without making it so clichè and predictable because I swear nowadays these so called Christmas movies now don't have the same warm fuzzy feeling like the ones in the past because they lack creativity and uniqueness,The Knight Before Christmas
115,scharlesstrickland,The Knight Before Christmas is...WILD!!!!,7,12 December 2019,"In the 2019 romantic-comedy film, 'The Knight Before Christmas,' by Monika Mitchell and screenwriter Cara Russell, the film follows the Knight Sir Cole (Josh Whitehouse) as he is transported from the medieval ages to present day in order to fulfill his destiny of receiving true love's kiss. Overall, the movie had great writing throughout, only to be left feeling let down by the plot and the cinematography. So, what went right and wrong here?Well, let us start off with the plot of the movie because it's a simple premise that works okay. Although the plot of the movie is very unfocused and in which certain tropes and plots are reused from different Hallmark movies there is nothing inherently wrong about being predictable. After all, if it isn't broke, don't fix it right? Well, the problem I have with the Knight Before Christmas is simply the fact that there is no tension because of its traditional nature. For example, Sir Knight Cole has to fulfill his destiny before Christmas or else he will never be able to go back to the time from which he came. This premise alone is great but because I know prior to viewing that this is going to be a feel-good movie (as all Hallmark movies are) the tension is gone. But other than the plot being predictable, the pacing in the final 10 minutes of the movie is satisfying but questionable. Yes, Sir Cole gets back to his time period but all he does is go up to his brother after he was thought to have been lost in a winter storm to say, ""Hi, I'm back, see you later."" and comes back to present day to live happily ever after with the love of his life. It makes you really question why the plot of needing a kiss to come back was really a necessary plot device if he was only going to spend 5 mins to just grab his horse and say goodbye to the thing he worked towards for the entire film.But other than my gripes with the structure of the story, everything else I thought worked fantastically. In particular, my favorite part was the comedy part of the rom-com, particularly Sir Cole and how he referred to present-day items using medieval terms. You would think that guy would learn how to say car instead of 'metal steed' considering how he immediately figured out how to use a remote. The continuity of the character role isn't always consistent but it is executed well since it leads to scenes that are very funny and/or adds to the romantic relationship between Cole and Brooke.The lighting was great I liked how it was changed every now and then with more shadows to convey more intense emotions, and more light in the shots to convey happier ones which benefited the cinematography by allowing each scene to be viewed easily. Speaking of cinematography, I thought the movie could have used more varied scenes. For example, I think I counted 5 times throughout the movie where they are at the Christmas town and if they are not there they are back at Brooke's house. As a result, It got a little stale in terms of fresh environments.The thematic content works well although like I said earlier, the composition of the movie is very traditional. Nothing really felt out of place except the Knight in the movie but since it was intentional it worked out to make the movie more appealing. These elements work well, I never felt like I cringed over poorly executed scenes.Overall, the movie is good. The plot could have been less traditional and added more tension. The cinematography was great although nothing mind-blowing. Finally, the relationship Cole and Brooke have in the movie really builds up well throughout the movie only to be diminished with a lackluster and questionable ending.",The Knight Before Christmas

Acting was poor at best.If you are looking for a fun, relaxing movie I would suggest not to watch it because it is not fun, it is not entertaining. It just doesn't work.

145,evaslife,Cheesy but pretty good,7,12 December 2019,"Monika Mitchell's The Knight Before Christmas sounds like another one of Netflix's cheesy romantic holiday movies, however, it is quite amusing. The screenplay written by Cara J. Russell, The Knight Before Christmas is the most recent installment of Netflix's holiday movies, having been released in November 2019. The film stars Vanessa Hudgens and Josh Whitehouse as it's main characters. Overall, although the movie itself appears cheesy, it is really not as bad as it sounds. There are some pretty good parts to this movie, as well the bad, just like any other movie.
In The Knight Before Christmas, Vanessa Hudgens plays a recently dumped science teacher named Brooke who gets her whole world turned upside down in an exotic romance during a magical Christmas week, just when she believed that true love did not exist. Brooke stumbles upon a fourteenth-century knight named Sir Cole (Josh Whitehouse) who gets pushed into time travel by an Old Crone he meets in the woods that tells him his destiny. In what feels like the blink of an eye, Sir Cole leaves 1330's England to a modern-day (2019) Bracebridge, Ohio. Brooke is the first person that the disoriented and confused knight meets. Its almost like they fall in love immediately, as their meeting is pretty typical for a romantic movie (guy spills a drink on girl or vice versa). For a science teacher, she quickly believed that Cole's time-traveling story. She even lets him stay in her home since he has no place to go. Although Brooke and Cole have strong differences, like every typical holiday movie, they fall in love. As with all romantic holiday movies, it's purpose is to entertain people, mostly of the teen and young adult age group.
While watching this film, although I did enjoy it, it had none to little appearance of logic. For one thing, medieval English and modern English are different enough that Sir Cole would not be able to communicate with Brooke, let alone use American slang. Another thing is that Santa is not thin, does not have a white beard, and does not ask children what they want for Christmas with Mrs. Claus. Seriously, Netflix? However, the biggest breach in logic is Cole's magical time portal. And even with that, it is the easiest thing to look past considering time travel is not an unpopular subject in movies. Even some of the most popular films of all time include time travel. With all this put into consideration, my impression of the film was pretty good.
The film's formal techniques and thematic content work well together. The pretty Christmas lights and romantic atmosphere aide in setting the mood for the film in order to make it more effective. The Knight Before Christmas has a main focus on cinematography, lighting, and genre then thematic content. The film, however, includes a very small amount of ""history"" as it begins with England in medieval times. It had an interesting plot, along with good editing that improves the quality of the film.
The Knight Before Christmas is no doubt just another cheesy holiday movie, it effectively gets its audience in the spirit of Christmas. I believe that this movie is worth seeing because it is a sweet, and romantic movie that is also appropriate for families, which is rare nowadays. It is also worth it to watch if romantic and holiday movies (or just one of the other) is your cup of tea. I would recommend this movie, not because of the beautiful Vanessa Hudgens or because it is romantic, but because it leaves you wondering whether or not Christmas really does bring magic.",The Knight Before Christmas
146,kirzmin,Not the best but not the worst,5,12 December 2019,"If you are looking for your classic romance cliche movie than The Knight Before Christmas is the movie you should watch. The Knight Before Christmas, directed by Monika Mitchell, released on November 21, 2019, first begins with a high school teacher, Brooke, who thinks that true love does not exist and that people should not waste their time thinking it does. However, the movie then goes on to focus on a knight, Sir Cole, who is looking for his quest to become a true knight. An old lady in the woods tells him that she knows how to fulfill his quest and to do that he must travel to a land ""far away."" Throughout the movie, they begin falling in love. The movie's main actress is Vanessa Hudgens (High School Musical, Journey 2) who plays Brooke. The movie's main actor is Josh Whitehouse (Poldark, Modern Life is Rubbish) who plays Sir Cole. The movie's intended audience teenage girls who believe in true love which then it also makes sense that the movie's genre is romance. Overall, the movie was a cringey and cliche story but was executed well enough for the viewer to not get bored and be entertained for awhile.While watching the movie there were times where I personally could not keep viewing the movie because of the amount of cliche there was in the movie. Not only that but before even reaching halfway into the movie the viewer is able to tell how the movie will end which causes the viewer to lose interest. While watching the movie I was impressed with how the filmed looked like since it did seem that the creators put a lot of effort into finding locations that actually went along well with the plot. I can also say that the sounds that were used in the film were not excessive and went well with the movie.Overall, the movie's cinematography was actually really good. For example, the shots that they chose to use in the movie were very beautiful. Not only that, but the editing in the movie was actually good as well. The scenes did not cut each other off and the transitions were done nicely as well. During the movie, you could also tell that a lot of thought did go into lighting since there were not any scenes that were not aesthetically pleasing. As for the thematic content in this movie, it can be said that it was trying to display that true love is still something that exists and people should still believe in it. I think all of these elements do work together because it does let the viewer be pleased with how the movie aesthetically looks.The Knight Before Christmas is a movie that focuses on a love story which overall is commonly seen in a lot of other movies. Would I recommend this movie? Yes, I would if you want to keep kids entertained or if you have time to waste and have nothing better to do. The plot might be a cliche but it is still a movie that allows the viewer to be entertained throughout most of the movie.",The Knight Before Christmas
147,selizabethgarcia-lagunas,I loved it,9,12 December 2019,"The Knight Before Christmas, directed by Monika Michell, was released on November 21, 2019. It is a romantic christmas movie in which the main characters are Vanessa Hudgens (Brook Winters) and Josh Whitehouse (Sir Cole from Norwich). In the movie, Brook Winters does not believe in true love. She has had her heart broken before by her ex boyfriend, but when the Sir Cole shows up in her life she has no choice but to start believing in true love. These two characters come from different backgrounds. Brook is from the present time and lives in the United States, Cole, on the other hand, is from the past and he lived in Norwich, England. When Sir Cole still lived in Norwich he found an old crone who assigned hi a quest. The problem was that the old crone did not tell him what this quest consisted of. He had to find out for himself. Sir Cole was required to fulfill the unknown quest before midnight on christmas. As christmas night approached, Sir Cole (Josh) still had no clue what this quest could be and how he could possibly solve it.
This specific film was created for all the people who like or are interested in christmas movies, magic, and love stories. It's purpose and the thematic content was that everything you desire can come true and can exist, even things that one may not believe in or that may seem impossible. The scenes in the movie were very well planned. The lighting was always on point and coordinated with the mood of each one of the scenes, and even whether it was taking place inside or outside. The mise-en-scene was also very creative. Since the theme of the movie was christmas, the scenes were always involved around christmas stuff and backgrounds. Throughout the whole movie the characters always spoke about the magic of giving which is kind of another theme to the movie.
I personally enjoyed the film very much. I love romantic movies as well as christmas movies. I feel like combining those two topics was a good idea. Although there are a lot of love movies that involve christmas, I think this was one of the best. Not only did the film project the love the couple had for one another, but it also informed the audience about real-life problems. For example, when Brook talks about how that single father never has enough money to give his children christmas presents, yet he makes sure that they are aware that gifts are not the most important things about christmas. I feel like this film can relate to the audience because everyone has either gone through this, or has known kids who don't get to enjoy christmas like all the other kids do due to economic reasons. Also, I enjoyed this film because, as previously stated, the characters make sure that the audience gets the message that christmas is not about receiving, instead, it is about giving, bringing joy to the people around you and helping those who may be in need. Sometimes something as simple as words or small gestures can help and impact the people around you in a positive way.
Overall, the movie was amazing. The creator of the movie was able to get his point across while also entertaining the audience with magic, love and laughter. Not only was the theme wonderful, but also everything that was included such as the scene set up, makeup, costumes, lines and lighting were exactly how they should've been. I have no negative criticism, for I believe the movie was definitely worth watching and I recommend it to everyone.",The Knight Before Christmas
148,ChingChongBingBong,A great poopcorn movie to watch with your 12 year old niece,5,12 December 2019,"The Knight Before Christmas, directed by Monkia Mitchell, is the all new seasonal Christmas Movie that is surely to be forgotten by the time January rolls by the following year. With the genre being a rom-com, its primarily targeted audience is most likely toward young girls with a life resume of 10 to 15 years. I say this assumption with great confidence because of how laughable the romance in the movie turns out to be. When closely analyzed, you can see that the plot of the story is even more cliche than the typical cliched Hallmark Christmas movies. Sure, most of us watch these popcorn movies for the cliched plot and the obvious ending, but I would say The Knight Before Christmas is definitely one of its own, with a plot so obvious that it might cause you to fall asleep if viewed in a comfy couch. The plot goes like this: A 13th century knight from England gets transported into modern day Whiteville Ohio to fulfill his quest as a true knight, and soon falls in love with a teacher of whom he very first met while arriving. And... it turns out his true quest given by this mysterious old lady is actually falling in love and kissing your significant other. Surprise. Although the romantic tension arising between these two as they interact during the movie is surely entertaining to watch, the story is so character heavy that it is almost too reliant on the sole ability of acting to the cast members. I would give The Knight Before Christmas a score of 5 out of 10, as it brings some pleasure and joy into watching the development as a popcorn movie, but it fails a memorable film because of its poor plot and awkward pacing.",The Knight Before Christmas
149,aljunaibi-76601,Masterpiece,10,20 December 2019,"Many claim that this movie is too romantic and unbelievable but it is after all fantasy, moreover we have to admit though true love is very hard to find these days, why not give people a hint of hope at a merry time, to be honest this is quite underrated compared to other movies! Rarely does any movie deserve a 10/10 but this one definitely does!",The Knight Before Christmas
150,glyndajones-87459,Not Good,3,10 December 2020,Was excited to watch based on the premise. Sounded like a cute storyline and preview looked cute. Movie was boring and I found the characters to have zero romantic chemistry.,The Knight Before Christmas
151,mricewallace,Bland 5/10,5,8 December 2020,"This movie is like how Emma Thompson acts like in front of her children in love actually
But on steroids... Hide the valium.",The Knight Before Christmas
152,shrutiagarwal-29641,Where is the storyline?,5,14 December 2020,I just created an IMDB account to review this movie. How possibly can a knight's true quest can be to fall in love with a woman who is born centuries later? I get the fantasy and everything but I cannot digest the fact that a man leaves his duty of being a knight just so that he can fall in love with a woman who gives advice to her student about love after being heartbroken.,The Knight Before Christmas
153,onepirate,Cute movie,9,23 November 2019,"But...a goof.
There are glass windows in the 1334 castle. Glass windows were not created until 1700s. Hehehe",The Knight Before Christmas

155,amyleo6423,"Same old, same old",1,22 November 2019,Your average corny movie. I'm a little disappointed in Vanessa. She could do better.,The Knight Before Christmas
156,yotakis,Happy Christmas movie.,8,3 December 2019,It shares nice christmas messages . Nice christmas romance movie.,The Knight Before Christmas
157,hoaixinh94,A good watch for this Christmas,9,22 November 2019,"I had a pleasure time watching this movie. Though the plot is not something novel, there is sure plenty to enjoy with your loved ones. Romance, humour and a little dash of medieval taste make an attractive combination for this time of the year.",The Knight Before Christmas
158,micharcle,Disappointment,5,24 November 2019,"I absolutely love Vanessa Hudgens. She was great, but this movie made me cringe.",The Knight Before Christmas
159,jane-patterso,Just awful,2,23 November 2019,"I Adore Romanic Christmas films and can suspend reality and accept most things, but this... was too much. Zero effort made in terms of research, clearly.
It makes no sense, for example a 14th century knight gets in a car and knows how to reverse and drive, but struggles with steering straight? Mittens leave finger marks? Windows in a castle? Etc etc etc.
It's just an utter joke, and more than anything I'm disappointed because I love this genre and feel a bit cheated, it could have been done so well, with a bit more care and attention to detail. This just feels slapped together.",The Knight Before Christmas

161,s267453,Quite Charming,8,24 November 2019,Lovely Romantic Comedy that reminded me of Kate and Leopold. My favorite Christmas movie so far of the season.,The Knight Before Christmas
162,beachgirl369,I loved it!,8,28 November 2019,"I thought was a sweet love story, and Sir Cole is adorable!!!! Worth watching over and over!",The Knight Before Christmas
163,peerie_bradders,"Cheesy, warm, Christmassy!",9,7 December 2019,"A feel good film, typical cheesy christmas one, but really good and a good difference it!",The Knight Before Christmas
164,karenknotts-85624,Still Feeling Good from this Movie!,10,25 November 2019,"This is one of the most enjoyable, original Christmas movies I've seen in years. The story blends together two disparate timelines to create a satisfying fantasy on many levels. The characters are really fun, too. There's a lot of humor when the knight (played charmingly by Josh Whitehouse) is catapulted from the year 1334 to the present and must rely on the Magic Box (TV) to tell him how to relate to these humans of the future. His love interest, played by Vanessa Hudgens, is a character on two levels, hungry for love and at the same time disdaining it. I actually watched it three times because there was so much going on in the the story. Great fun for the family!",The Knight Before Christmas
165,crystalrenae-83854,Love it,10,22 December 2019,My daughter and I loved this movie! We hope they make a part 2 💗🎄🎁🎅🤶,The Knight Before Christmas
166,brittanyannkurtz,Pretty cheesy,5,13 December 2019,"Acting is mediocre overall, although I think josh whitehouse does a convincing job. It's inconsistent at best.",The Knight Before Christmas
167,smarlowe-83358,Watchable,6,29 November 2019,"This movie is cheesy but you expect that going into it. It's cute, feel -good, Christmas movie. The mindless tv you need sometimes. Only specific feedback is that they should probably have thought more about the name choice for Sir Cole, it sounds like they're saying 'circle' the whole movie.",The Knight Before Christmas
168,ewok-63477,From modern day Norwich.,10,21 November 2019,"Honestly,, the main draw for this film had to be the fact that I'm from Norwich in England myself, and it's a bit more than a castle and a barn now, but all in all enjoyed the film. Lighthearted and amusing like Enchanted before it.",The Knight Before Christmas
169,kacmcconnell,So cute,9,25 November 2019,"Yes, it's a bit farfetched but the theme is the same no matter where (or when) you are. The casting was perfect too. Definitely will watch again and again.",The Knight Before Christmas
170,akuray-58702,very bad,1,4 December 2019,I don't know why i am finish watching this movie. Maybe i am hoping that would happen something miracle but until the end i feel so frustrated. really bad never watch vanessa movie anymore,The Knight Before Christmas
171,mkatelopez,Adorable But Not Realistic,6,29 November 2019,"I'm picky about cheesy Christmas movies & enjoyed this one, but I might be bias to the fact of how adorable the character Cole is in the movie. There was one thing that bothered me though, & that is that her home did not reflect in anyway what a teacher could afford. As an elementary teacher who struggles to make ends meet, this is not reality. But I think that if you enjoy mindless, cheesy Christmas movies then it is definitely worth the watch & will put you in the Christmas spirit! :)",The Knight Before Christmas
172,rkpro-12039,Trust Me,9,25 November 2019,"Even though I was in a HELL of a mood, ask the jerk and the sheriff who called in the middle of the movie, I still had a few laughs and was able to relax.",The Knight Before Christmas
